    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without acute infarction. It is a warning sign for an impending stroke and requires prompt evaluation and secondary prevention.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nTIA is most commonly due to embolic or thrombotic events in a cerebral artery that transiently compromise cerebral blood flow. In patients with diabetes mellitus and other vascular risk factors, small vessel atherosclerosis and embolic phenomena often play a role. The transient occlusion leads to reversible neurological deficits when reperfusion occurs.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn this case, a 64\u2010year\u2010old diabetic patient experienced weakness lasting 25 minutes. This classic presentation of a TIA indicates a temporary reduction in blood flow. Recognizing TIA is crucial because of the high subsequent stroke risk.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is primarily clinical with supportive imaging. A non-contrast CT scan is used to rule out hemorrhage or completed infarction, while MRI (especially with diffusion-weighted imaging) is more sensitive in detecting acute ischemia. Differential diagnoses include seizure with postictal paresis, migraine aura, or hypoglycemic events.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAccording to current guidelines, for patients with a TIA who are at high risk for stroke (often with an ABCD2 score \u22654), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using aspirin plus clopidogrel is recommended for the short term (typically 21\u201390 days) to reduce recurrent stroke risk. After this period, therapy is usually de-escalated to single antiplatelet therapy. In pregnant or lactating women (if encountered), low-dose aspirin is generally considered acceptable, although clopidogrel is used with caution and only if the benefits outweigh potential risks.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (loading with clopidogrel followed by regular aspirin plus clopidogrel) is correct because numerous studies (such as the CHANCE and POINT trials) have shown that early initiation of DAPT in high-risk TIA/minor stroke patients reduces the risk of subsequent stroke. Options that suggest only aspirin monotherapy or no antiplatelet treatment would not address the high risk of recurrence adequately.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. TIA is a crucial warning sign for stroke, and early intervention can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. 2. In high-risk TIA patients, DAPT should be initiated within 24 hours. 3. Always address modifiable vascular risk factors alongside antiplatelet therapy.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent trials (CHANCE, POINT) support the use of DAPT in reducing the risk of stroke after a TIA, particularly in the first 21 to 90 days. Guidelines stress the importance of rapid intervention and risk factor modification.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nRisk stratification after a TIA is commonly done using the ABCD2 score, which estimates the risk of subsequent stroke within 90 days based on factors such as Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of symptoms, and Diabetes.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe underlying mechanism involves temporary blockage of a cerebral artery leading to transient symptoms. In patients with multiple risk factors (such as diabetes, hypertension, and significant symptomatology like unilateral weakness), the likelihood of an unstable vascular pathology and subsequent stroke is high.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nA 65-year-old male with diabetes and hypertension who experienced 18 minutes of left-side weakness would accumulate a high ABCD2 score (Age \u226560 = 1, blood pressure \u2265140 systolic = 1, unilateral weakness = 2, duration >10 minutes = 1, plus diabetes = 1; total = 6). A score of 6 correlates with a high risk of stroke in the next 90 days.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nRisk assessment in TIA patients involves a detailed history and physical examination combined with imaging studies (CT/MRI) to rule out infarction. Differential diagnoses include transient seizures or syncope. The scoring system (ABCD2) helps differentiate patients at low versus high risk.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nHigh-risk TIA patients should be managed urgently with dual antiplatelet therapy along with aggressive control of vascular risk factors. Hospitalization for further work-up, including vascular imaging, may be indicated. While not directly affecting this older male patient, in pregnant or lactating patients, low-dose aspirin is acceptable and other agents are used with caution.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption C, which labels the 90-day stroke risk as 'High', is correct given the patient's risk factors and ABCD2 score of 6. Options indicating low or moderate risk would underestimate the potential for recurrent stroke.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. An ABCD2 score of 4 or greater indicates high risk for a subsequent stroke. 2. Unilateral weakness gives 2 points and is a strong predictor of stroke risk. 3. Early intervention in high-risk TIA patients is critical to prevent a full-blown stroke.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nGuidelines consistently recommend rapid evaluation and initiation of DAPT in high-risk TIA patients to reduce the chance of subsequent stroke. Recent studies validate the use of ABCD2 in prognostication.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThird nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy can be caused by various etiologies. A key clinical differentiation is whether the pupil is involved because compressive lesions (like aneurysms) typically affect the pupillary fibers.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe oculomotor nerve has superficially located parasympathetic fibers that control pupillary constriction. A posterior communicating (PCom) artery aneurysm can compress these fibers, leading to pupil dilation and dysfunction, distinguishing it from ischemic (microvascular) causes that usually spare the pupil.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn a young patient presenting with a third nerve palsy that includes pupil involvement, the clinical suspicion for a PCom aneurysm is high, making it a neurosurgical emergency due to the risk of rupture and subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis involves neuroimaging with CT angiography or MR angiography to identify the aneurysm. Differential diagnoses include diabetic microvascular third nerve palsy (which typically spares the pupil), midbrain infarct, cavernous sinus syndrome, and myasthenia gravis.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nImmediate neurosurgical referral is required. Management options include endovascular coiling or surgical clipping of the aneurysm. In pregnancy, management becomes more complex, necessitating a balance between maternal and fetal risks, and generally requires a multidisciplinary team including neurosurgery, obstetrics, and anesthesia.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nAlthough the options are not explicitly listed, the key concept is that in the setting of a pupil-involving third nerve palsy, a PCom aneurysm is the most likely and critical diagnosis. Alternative choices such as diabetic neuropathy (which spares the pupil), midbrain infarct (which has additional signs), cavernous sinus syndrome, or myasthenia gravis would be incorrect.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Pupil involvement in third nerve palsy points to a compressive etiology. 2. A PCom aneurysm is a neurosurgical emergency. 3. Diabetic third nerve palsy rarely involves the pupil.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent neuroimaging advances have improved early detection of aneurysms. Updated guidelines stress the urgency of neurosurgical evaluation for pupil-involving third nerve palsies to prevent catastrophic hemorrhage.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nHemiballismus is a rare movement disorder characterized by violent, involuntary flinging movements of the limbs, typically due to a lesion in the subthalamic nucleus.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe subthalamic nucleus plays a key role in modulating motor activity through the basal ganglia circuit. Lesions, most commonly lacunar infarcts due to small vessel disease, disrupt this modulation, resulting in disinhibited, excessive motor output on the contralateral side.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nAn elderly female presenting with sudden abnormal, involuntary movements in the left arm and leg is highly suggestive of a lacunar stroke affecting the right subthalamic nucleus, which produces contralateral hemiballismus. The normal CT initially followed by an abnormal MRI stroke protocol is typical, as small deep infarcts may not be evident on CT.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis relies on clinical findings of hemiballismus combined with imaging. MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting small lacunar infarcts. Differential diagnoses include other movement disorders such as chorea (often seen in metabolic or neurodegenerative conditions) or seizures.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement focuses on addressing the underlying stroke with antithrombotic therapy and aggressive control of vascular risk factors. Symptomatic treatment for hemiballismus may involve dopamine-depleting agents or neuroleptics if the movements are severe. In patients who are pregnant or lactating, careful selection of medications is essential; many antipsychotics require risk\u2013benefit analysis and close monitoring.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption B (Sub-thalamic) is correct. Lesions in other locations \u2013 midbrain, pons, and medulla \u2013 are not typically associated with hemiballismus. The subthalamic nucleus is the classic site for lacunar infarcts causing this condition.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Lacunar infarcts in the subthalamic nucleus can cause contralateral hemiballismus. 2. CT scans may be normal early in the stroke, making MRI the investigation of choice. 3. Rapid recognition is important to initiate appropriate vascular risk management.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent advances in MRI technology have improved the detection of small, deep infarcts. Current guidelines emphasize aggressive vascular risk factor management and appropriate antithrombotic therapy in patients with lacunar strokes.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nCerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT) is a condition where a clot forms in the brain\u2019s venous sinuses, leading to impaired venous drainage. This contrasts with cerebral vasculitis, which involves an inflammatory destruction of the vessel wall primarily affecting smaller arteries. The clinical distinction is crucial because the management, prognosis, and underlying risk factors differ between these two entities.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIn CVT, thrombus formation within the cerebral veins or dural sinuses causes increased venous pressure, resulting in cerebral edema, venous infarction, and potentially hemorrhagic transformation due to disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier. In contrast, cerebral vasculitis involves immune-mediated inflammatory damage to blood vessel walls, which can lead to multiple areas of infarction. CVT is often associated with conditions that promote a hypercoagulable state such as pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, infection, or inherited thrombophilia.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with CVT typically present with headache (often the most common symptom), seizures, focal neurological deficits, and signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., papilledema). A presentation with acute neurological deficits in a setting that suggests a clotting disorder is more consistent with CVT rather than an insidious inflammatory process as seen in cerebral vasculitis.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe gold standard for diagnosing CVT is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or computed tomography venography (CTV). These imaging modalities can reveal the absence of flow in the affected venous sinuses. In contrast, diagnosing cerebral vasculitis may require vessel wall imaging, laboratory markers of inflammation, and sometimes brain biopsy. Differential diagnoses include intracranial hemorrhage, arterial ischemic stroke, and other causes of headache and focal deficits.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe first-line treatment for CVT is immediate anticoagulation, typically with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin, even in the presence of small hemorrhagic infarcts. This is followed by a transition to oral anticoagulants for several months based on individual risk. For pregnant patients, LMWH is preferred due to its safety profile. Second-line treatments may include endovascular thrombolysis in refractory cases. In contrast, management of cerebral vasculitis involves high-dose corticosteroids and often immunosuppressive agents.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Cerebral vasculitis) is incorrect because the clinical and imaging features (as implied in the context) lean more towards a thrombotic process than an inflammatory one. Option B (CVT) is the correct diagnosis given the typical presentation and factors associated with venous thrombosis.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. CVT often presents with a new-onset headache and neurological deficits in a patient with a hypercoagulable state. 2. MRI with MR venography is the diagnostic study of choice. 3. Early anticoagulation is critical, even if there is evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines from organizations such as the American Heart Association endorse early anticoagulation for CVT and suggest that newer direct oral anticoagulants may have a role in long-term management, though more research is ongoing. The emphasis remains on rapid diagnosis with advanced imaging techniques.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question addresses the selection of the appropriate next laboratory investigation in a patient presumably being evaluated for stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The options include tests for dyslipidemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, and CADASIL, each of which is relevant to different underlying etiologies of cerebrovascular disease.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nElevated levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are well-established contributors to atherosclerotic plaque formation, leading to an increased risk for ischemic events. Beta 2 glycoprotein antibodies are associated with an autoimmune-induced hypercoagulable state in antiphospholipid syndrome, while mutations in NOTCH3 are linked with CADASIL, a hereditary arteriopathy affecting small vessels.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn the evaluation of a patient with suspected ischemic stroke or TIA, assessing traditional cardiovascular risk factors is vital. A lipid panel (cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL) is routinely ordered to evaluate atherosclerotic risk. The patient\u2019s clinical context, which likely includes other vascular risk factors, makes option B the most appropriate next step.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe workup for ischemic cerebrovascular events includes neuroimaging along with laboratory tests to determine risk factors. While Beta 2 glycoprotein antibody tests and genetic screening for NOTCH3 are important in select cases (such as when clinical suspicion for antiphospholipid syndrome or CADASIL is high), the lipid panel is generally the first step given its broad applicability and ease of testing.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nBased on the results of the lipid panel, lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic treatments (e.g., statins) are initiated as first-line therapy in ischemic stroke risk reduction. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of statins is contraindicated due to teratogenicity, so alternative therapies and close monitoring are advised.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Beta 2 glycoprotein antibody) is specifically used when antiphospholipid syndrome is suspected, and Option C (NOTCH 3) is reserved for cases with a strong family history or clinical suspicion of CADASIL. Option B, the cholesterol panel, is the most appropriate initial test in the absence of specific indicators toward autoimmune or genetic causes.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. A lipid panel is a cost-effective and essential screening tool in the evaluation of stroke risk factors. 2. Differentiating between atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic causes of stroke is key to targeted therapy. 3. Always consider the patient\u2019s overall clinical picture before ordering specialized tests.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent stroke prevention guidelines continue to emphasize aggressive management of dyslipidemia as a cornerstone of ischemic stroke prevention. The utility of a lipid profile in guiding therapy is well supported by current evidence.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question revolves around risk stratification in patients with a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The widely used ABCD2 score includes Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of TIA, and Diabetes to predict the short-term risk of stroke following a TIA.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nA TIA results from transient cerebral ischemia without causing permanent infarction. Factors such as older age, hypertension, diabetes, and clinical features like unilateral weakness contribute to an increased risk of subsequent stroke.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn this 62-year-old male with a 12-year history of diabetes, hypertension, and an episode of left-sided weakness lasting 10 minutes, the ABCD2 score is likely high. Studies have shown that patients with high scores can have a 90-day stroke risk of approximately 18%.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nAssessment involves careful history taking, neurological examination, and calculating the ABCD2 score. Neuroimaging (MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging) is used to rule out infarction. Differential diagnoses include seizure, hypoglycemia, and migraine aura, which are ruled out based on clinical context and imaging findings.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nImmediate management includes starting antiplatelet therapy (typically aspirin) and instituting risk factor modification such as blood pressure control, glycemic management, and lipid lowering. Patients with high ABCD2 scores should be admitted for urgent evaluation. In pregnant or lactating patients, low-dose aspirin may be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks, but careful monitoring is needed.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Low risk 3%) underestimates the risk given the patient\u2019s multiple risk factors. Option B (High risk 18%) aligns with data from studies correlating a high ABCD2 score with a near 18% risk of stroke within 90 days. Option C (Moderate risk) is too vague and lacks the quantitative specificity provided by current evidence.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. The ABCD2 score is a quick and useful tool to predict stroke risk after a TIA. 2. Diabetes and hypertension significantly elevate the risk of subsequent stroke. 3. Prompt assessment and intervention can drastically reduce subsequent stroke risk.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent validation studies of the ABCD2 score support its use in clinical practice to identify patients at high risk for stroke. Updated guidelines emphasize rapid secondary prevention measures in patients with high ABCD2 scores to reduce the incidence of early stroke.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question tests knowledge of the contraindications for administering intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) in acute ischemic stroke. The protocol mandates careful patient selection to avoid complications such as hemorrhage.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIV tPA facilitates clot dissolution by activating plasminogen to plasmin. However, in patients with significant thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), the risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, increases because platelets are essential for clot formation and hemostasis. A platelet count below 100,000/\u00b5L is generally considered an absolute contraindication.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn this case, the patient presented with acute ischemic stroke symptoms within the therapeutic window (3.5 hours). However, his platelet count was only 45,000/\u00b5L\u2014a clear violation of the protocol. Despite the acceptable time frame, the administration of tPA in the context of severe thrombocytopenia predisposed him to intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nPrior to administration of rTPA, a complete blood count (CBC) is mandatory to screen for contraindications such as coagulopathies and thrombocytopenia. Differential considerations for hemorrhagic complications post-tPA include uncontrolled hypertension and underlying coagulopathies, but in this instance, the low platelet count is the primary red flag.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAccording to current guidelines, IV tPA should not be administered in the presence of a platelet count less than 100,000/\u00b5L. The first step in managing acute ischemic stroke is a thorough laboratory evaluation. In cases where contraindications are present, alternative management strategies and supportive care should be pursued. For pregnant patients, while rTPA can be considered if absolutely necessary, the same laboratory contraindications apply, underscoring the universal need for caution.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Low deficit) is not a contraindication to tPA. Option B (Out of TPA window) is incorrect because the patient presented within the accepted time frame. Option C (Platelet count of 45,000) accurately identifies an absolute contraindication to tPA administration according to established protocols.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Always verify laboratory values, especially platelet count, before proceeding with rTPA. 2. Thrombocytopenia is an absolute contraindication to thrombolytic therapy. 3. Strict adherence to stroke treatment protocols is essential to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic complications.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nUpdated guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association reinforce that a platelet count below 100,000/\u00b5L is a contraindication to tPA therapy.

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nAcute ischemic stroke treatment centers on rapid reperfusion of the affected brain region. The two main modalities are IV thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. When contraindications to IV thrombolysis exist (for example, due to high bleeding risk or recent surgery), mechanical thrombectomy becomes the preferred modality\u2014especially in patients with large vessel occlusion.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIn ischemic stroke, an occlusive thrombus blocks cerebral blood flow leading to ischemia and potential infarction. IV thrombolytic agents (e.g., alteplase) dissolve clots through enzymatic degradation. However, when there is an absolute contraindication to thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy uses endovascular devices (like stent retrievers or aspiration catheters) to physically remove the clot, restoring blood flow to salvageable brain tissue.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with large vessel occlusions often present with sudden focal deficits. Rapid imaging (noncontrast CT followed by CT angiography) is used to rule out hemorrhage and to locate the occlusion. When IV thrombolysis is contraindicated, timely decision\u2010making to perform mechanical thrombectomy is crucial to improve outcomes.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nInitial evaluation includes a noncontrast CT scan to exclude hemorrhage and MRI/CT angiography to assess the location and extent of occlusion. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic stroke, stroke mimics (e.g., seizure, migraine), and other ischemic etiologies. Identifying a large vessel occlusion with salvageable penumbra is key to opting for thrombectomy.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAccording to the latest AHA/ASA guidelines, eligible acute ischemic stroke patients should receive IV thrombolysis within 4.5 hours if no contraindications exist. In patients with large vessel occlusion or those contraindicated for IV thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy is recommended, with trials (e.g., DAWN and DEFUSE-3) extending the treatment window up to 24 hours in selected cases. In pregnant or lactating patients, treatment must be individualized\u2014the risks of systemic thrombolysis are weighed against potential benefits, and thrombectomy may be preferred given lower systemic drug exposure.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A is a statement declaring IV thrombolytics as absolutely contraindicated, which does not represent an active management strategy. Option B (mechanical thrombectomy) is correct because it represents the appropriate management option in a scenario where IV thrombolysis is contraindicated. Option C (IV thrombolysis) would be contraindicated in this context, and Option D (combination therapy) is not applicable since thrombolysis cannot be used.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Mechanical thrombectomy has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with large vessel occlusion strokes and contraindications to IV thrombolysis. 2. Rapid imaging and door-to-treatment time are critical for successful reperfusion. 3. In pregnancy, multidisciplinary risk-benefit analysis is essential when considering reperfusion therapy.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent landmark trials such as DAWN and DEFUSE-3 have expanded the window for mechanical thrombectomy and solidified its role in acute stroke management, particularly in patients with large vessel occlusion. Current guidelines recommend thrombectomy in patients who cannot receive IV thrombolysis due to contraindications.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nCADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary small vessel disease that presents with recurrent strokes, migraine with aura, and cognitive decline. The condition has a strong familial pattern and is confirmed by identifying mutations in the NOTCH3 gene.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nMutations in the NOTCH3 gene lead to degeneration and dysfunction of vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in thickened, fibrotic small arteries. This compromises cerebral blood flow, particularly in the subcortical regions, leading to ischemic injury and the characteristic white matter changes seen on MRI.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nAffected individuals typically present in mid-adulthood with a history of migraine (often with aura), subcortical ischemic strokes, and progressively worsening cognitive impairment. A positive family history (e.g., a parent dying young) heightens suspicion for a genetic etiology like CADASIL.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe diagnostic workup includes brain MRI, which commonly shows white matter hyperintensities in the anterior temporal poles and external capsules. However, definitive diagnosis is achieved via genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations. Differential diagnoses include other causes of small vessel disease, demyelinating disorders, and mitochondrial cytopathies.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThere is no curative treatment for CADASIL; management focuses on controlling vascular risk factors, symptomatic treatment, and secondary stroke prevention. Antiplatelet agents and blood pressure management are often employed. Genetic counseling is recommended. In pregnant or lactating patients, careful blood pressure management is essential and medications should be chosen with safety profiles in mind.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nThe correct answer is genetic testing for the NOTCH3 mutation, as it directly confirms the diagnosis of CADASIL. Echocardiography is more useful when an embolic source is suspected, and testing for antiphospholipid antibodies is pertinent in acquired hypercoagulable states, neither of which aligns with the classic clinical picture of CADASIL.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. CADASIL should be suspected in young to middle-aged patients with a combination of strokes, migraine with aura, and a positive family history. 2. The anterior temporal lobe white matter lesions on MRI are a helpful radiological clue. 3. There is currently no disease-modifying treatment for CADASIL; management is supportive.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nContemporary research continues to focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms in CADASIL with the aim of developing targeted therapies. Meanwhile, management remains symptomatic and preventive, with genetic testing serving as the gold standard for diagnosis.",
