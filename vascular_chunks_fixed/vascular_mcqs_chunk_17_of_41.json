    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nReversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by sudden, severe (\u201cthunderclap\u201d) headaches and reversible segmental narrowing of cerebral arteries. Recognizing its typical imaging findings is crucial for diagnosis.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nRCVS reflects transient dysregulation of cerebrovascular tone, often triggered by vasoactive substances, the postpartum state, or certain medications. The fluctuating vasospasm produces a characteristic pattern of multifocal arterial narrowing that reverses over time.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with RCVS typically present with sudden-onset, severe headaches. Some may develop focal neurologic deficits or experience seizures. Importantly, imaging often reveals the hallmark multifocal and segmental narrowing of cerebral vessels.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis relies on neuroimaging. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) typically reveal a \u2018string-of-beads\u2019 appearance due to alternating constriction and dilation. Differential diagnoses include aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, primary angiitis of the central nervous system, and cerebral vasculitis.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement is predominantly supportive. First\u2010line treatment includes removal of any offending agents and symptomatic management. Calcium channel blockers (such as nimodipine or verapamil) may be used to alleviate vasoconstriction. In pregnant or lactating patients, careful drug selection is essential; for example, although many calcium channel blockers are category C, they may be used if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Low glucose) is not a feature of RCVS and does not reflect the underlying vascular abnormality. Although the other options were not explicitly provided, the correct answer should highlight the reversible vasoconstrictive changes seen on imaging \u2013 corresponding to Option B.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. RCVS is most commonly identified by its thunderclap headache and reversible, multifocal segmental vasoconstriction on angiographic studies. 2. It is important not to confuse RCVS with primary vasculitis, as the treatment strategies differ markedly.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent research emphasizes early and accurate imaging to differentiate RCVS from other cerebral vasculopathies. Updated guidelines advocate for supportive management with avoidance of triggers, reinforcing that abnormal glucose levels are not a feature of this condition.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThe ABCD2 score is a clinical tool for risk-stratifying patients after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) to predict the short-term risk of stroke. It incorporates Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of symptoms, and Diabetes.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nTIAs result from transient cerebral ischemia, often due to embolism or small vessel occlusion in the setting of underlying atherosclerosis. The score reflects the cumulative risk imposed by these factors.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn a 60\u2010year\u2010old male with traditional vascular risk factors and a transient episode of neurological deficits, a high ABCD2 score indicates a substantial risk for future stroke. Persistent neurologic deficits (such as ongoing numbness) further raise concern and influence treatment intensity.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDifferentiation involves excluding mimics like migraine, seizure-related symptoms, or hypoglycemia. Neuroimaging (CT/MRI) is needed to rule out acute infarction and to evaluate for underlying vascular pathology.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nCurrent guidelines, informed by trials such as CHANCE and POINT, support the initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) within 24 hours of a high-risk TIA or minor stroke and continuing it for 21\u201390 days before transitioning to monotherapy. Although this patient is a 60-year-old male, these principles are standard; in pregnant or lactating patients, low-dose aspirin is often acceptable, but clopidogrel has a less established safety profile and is generally used with caution.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (aspirin alone) and Option B (clopidogrel alone) may be considered in lower-risk settings, but for high-risk TIA, dual therapy (Option C) has been proven superior in reducing early recurrent stroke risk. Option D was not provided.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Dual antiplatelet therapy is beneficial when initiated early in high-risk TIA or minor stroke patients to reduce recurrent stroke risk. 2. The ABCD2 score is an essential clinical tool for determining the intensity of secondary prevention strategies.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nLarge-scale trials, including CHANCE and POINT, have firmly established the benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy in reducing stroke recurrence in patients with high ABCD2 scores, thereby shaping current guideline recommendations.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nManagement of symptomatic large vessel cerebrovascular stenosis requires an evaluation of both the severity of the stenosis and the symptoms. The initial treatment approach generally prioritizes optimized medical management over immediate invasive procedures.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAtherosclerotic disease in large vessels, such as the carotid arteries, leads to narrowing and turbulent flow that predisposes to thromboembolic events and hypoperfusion. The chronic inflammatory process leads to plaque formation and progression of stenosis.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with symptomatic stenosis presenting with TIA or minor stroke symptoms are at risk for further ischemic events. While invasive procedures like endarterectomy or stenting can reduce stroke risk in selected patients, many individuals initially benefit from aggressive medical therapy that addresses risk factors and stabilizes plaque.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is typically confirmed by noninvasive imaging modalities such as carotid duplex ultrasonography, CTA, or MRA. Differential diagnoses include intracranial atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and cardioembolic sources; the degree of stenosis guides the treatment plan.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nCurrent guidelines emphasize that the first-line management for most patients with large vessel stenosis is optimized medical therapy. This includes antiplatelet agents (often aspirin \u00b1 clopidogrel), high-intensity statin therapy, strict blood pressure control, and lifestyle modification. In patients with high-grade (typically >70%) symptomatic stenosis, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) may be indicated if the patient is an appropriate surgical candidate. Carotid stenting is reserved for patients with contraindications to surgery. In pregnant and lactating patients, medications must be selected for safety; for example, low-dose aspirin is generally acceptable in pregnancy, whereas many statins and interventional procedures are contraindicated or require special consideration.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (angioplasty alone) is not recommended because it can lead to vessel recoil and restenosis. Option B (stenting) is typically reserved for patients who cannot undergo surgery, while Option C (endarterectomy) is an option for selected high-grade stenosis cases but is not universally required. Option D (medical therapy) is the most appropriate initial approach in a broad range of patients with large vessel stenosis.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Optimal medical management, including risk factor modification, is the cornerstone of treatment for cerebrovascular stenosis. 2. Invasive interventions should be reserved for carefully selected patients after a thorough evaluation of stenosis severity.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent trials such as SAMMPRIS and CREST have underscored the efficacy of aggressive medical therapy in reducing recurrent stroke risk and have helped refine the indications for interventional procedures in patients with large vessel cerebrovascular disease.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nIn patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the abnormal hemoglobin leads to red blood cell sickling, which can cause vaso-occlusion and vascular injury, notably in cerebral vessels. This predisposes them to stroke and progressive vasculopathy.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe sickling of red blood cells in SCD results in chronic hemolysis and microvascular occlusions. Repeated vaso-occlusive events damage the endothelium, leading to intimal hyperplasia and progressive arterial stenosis, particularly affecting major intracranial arteries such as the anterior (AcA) and middle cerebral arteries (McA).\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nSCD patients are at high risk for both overt and silent strokes, often presenting with transient ischemic attacks or neurological deficits. The identification of multiple intracranial stenoses on stroke workup is a common finding in this population.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe evaluation involves neuroimaging studies, including MRA or CTA, to assess vessel patency and differentiate SCD vasculopathy from other conditions such as atherosclerotic disease or inflammatory vasculitis. Differential diagnoses include moyamoya syndrome and other forms of vasculitis.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nChronic blood transfusion therapy is the cornerstone of both primary and secondary stroke prevention in SCD. Regular transfusions work by reducing the proportion of hemoglobin S below 30%, thereby minimizing sickling events and reducing stroke risk. Hydroxyurea may be considered as an adjunct therapy in some cases. In pregnant or lactating patients with SCD, transfusion protocols must be carefully managed by a multidisciplinary team, balancing maternal and fetal risks while ensuring optimal reduction in stroke risk.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (aspirin) and Option B (clopidogrel) are antiplatelet regimens typically used in atherosclerotic stroke prevention and do not address the underlying pathophysiology of SCD. Option D (dual antiplatelet therapy) similarly fails to alter the sickling process. Option C (chronic transfusion) is the established and effective method for stroke prevention in SCD by reducing the hemoglobin S load.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Chronic transfusion therapy remains the standard of care for stroke prevention in SCD, targeting a reduction in hemoglobin S levels. 2. SCD vasculopathy involves unique mechanisms distinct from atherosclerotic disease, thus requiring different treatment strategies.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies continue to support the efficacy of chronic transfusion protocols in reducing stroke incidence in SCD patients. Ongoing research into adjunctive therapies, including hydroxyurea and gene therapy, aims to further improve outcomes in this high-risk population.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question focuses on the mechanism underlying a specific subtype of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) \u2013 the premesencephalic hemorrhage. Unlike the more common aneurysmal SAH, premesencephalic hemorrhage is a nonaneurysmal bleed localized to the pre\u2010mesencephalic cisterns.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nPremesencephalic hemorrhage is thought to arise from a venous or minor arterial source rather than from a ruptured aneurysm. Its bleeding is confined to the cisterns anterior to the midbrain with no aneurysm detected on vascular imaging. This distinct mechanism accounts for its generally benign clinical course compared with the typical aneurysmal bleed.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nClinically, patients with a premesencephalic hemorrhage usually present with a less severe headache with fewer neurological deficits and have a lower risk of complications such as re-bleeding or vasospasm. Radiographically, the hemorrhage is localized, and CT angiography fails to reveal an aneurysm.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe evaluation begins with a noncontrast head CT to confirm SAH. Given the hemorrhage\u2019s characteristic location, a CT angiogram (CTA) is used to exclude aneurysmal causes. In ambiguous cases, lumbar puncture may be performed. Differential diagnoses include aneurysmal SAH, perimesencephalic hemorrhage from other causes, and other intracranial hemorrhages.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement is mainly supportive. Patients are observed and managed conservatively with pain control and blood pressure regulation since there is no aneurysm to secure. In patients with this hemorrhage, aggressive interventions such as surgical clipping or coiling are not warranted. During pregnancy and lactation, conservative management remains the mainstay while monitoring maternal and fetal status.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption 1 (Aneurysm rupture) is incorrect because, while it is the most common cause of SAH, it does not account for the localized bleeding pattern and benign course of premesencephalic hemorrhage. Option 2 (Atherosclerosis) is not a cause of SAH but is linked to ischemic events. Option 3 (Premesencephalic hemorrhage) is the correct mechanism as it specifically describes the nonaneurysmal bleed observed in this scenario. Option 4 is not provided.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Premesencephalic SAH has a better prognosis than aneurysmal SAH. 2. Its characteristic CT findings (localized anterior to the midbrain) help differentiate it from aneurysmal SAH. 3. CTA is essential to rule out an aneurysm before determining conservative management.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies support that in cases of SAH with a premesencephalic pattern and no vascular lesions on CTA, conservative management yields favorable outcomes. Advances in imaging continue to improve our ability to distinguish between aneurysmal and nonaneurysmal causes, thereby optimizing patient management.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question addresses the acute management of ischemic stroke in the hyperacute phase. The mainstay treatment for eligible patients is thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIn ischemic stroke, clot formation leads to occlusion of cerebral blood vessels, resulting in neuronal ischemia and infarction. Early restoration of blood flow with tPA can dissolve the thrombus, limiting tissue damage and improving outcomes.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nThe patient, an 82\u2010year\u2010old male, presented within 3 hours of symptom onset with early signs on CT but without established infarction. The absence of contraindications combined with the timely presentation makes him a good candidate for tPA despite advanced age.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nInitial evaluation includes a noncontrast head CT to rule out hemorrhage, assessment of stroke symptoms, and careful review of contraindications. Differential diagnoses include stroke mimics such as seizures or hypoglycemia. However, early ischemic changes assessed on CT support the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe current guidelines recommend intravenous tPA as a first-line treatment for eligible patients presenting within 3 hours (and in select cases up to 4.5 hours) of stroke onset. In elderly patients, tPA is not contraindicated; careful evaluation of bleeding risk is crucial. In pregnancy and lactation, tPA can be used if benefits outweigh risks, though data in these populations are limited and management should be individualized.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Aspirin) and Option B (Plavix) are antiplatelet agents generally used for secondary prevention, not for acute reperfusion. Option C (tPA) is the correct choice as it is the established treatment in the hyperacute period when no contraindications exist. Option D is not provided.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Time is brain: early administration of tPA is critical. 2. Advanced age alone is not a contraindication for tPA. 3. CT imaging is essential to rule out hemorrhage before initiating therapy.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent AHA/ASA updates affirm the benefit of tPA in eligible patients within the 3-hour window, with growing evidence supporting its use in patients over 80 years old, provided contraindications are absent. Ongoing research continues to refine selection criteria, including the use of advanced imaging techniques.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question involves the acute management of an ischemic stroke presenting with occipital lobe involvement, where symptoms may include visual disturbances such as seeing animals (visual hallucinations).\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAn infarct in the occipital lobe affects the visual processing center of the brain, leading to phenomena such as visual hallucinations or altered vision. This ischemic process results from an arterial occlusion that, if treated promptly, can be salvaged using reperfusion therapy.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nThe case describes a patient with a new left occipital stroke who presented acutely (within 1 hour), making him an ideal candidate for thrombolytic therapy. Despite being intubated, if there are no contraindications and the patient is within the therapeutic window, tPA can significantly improve outcomes.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nA noncontrast CT scan is performed first to exclude hemorrhage, supported by clinical history. Although additional studies like CT angiogram (CTA) can help visualize vessel occlusion, the immediate determination of eligibility for tPA is paramount. Differential diagnosis would include seizure activity or other visual disturbances, but imaging confirming a new infarct solidifies the diagnosis.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFor eligible patients presenting within the approved time window (up to 4.5 hours, with the greatest benefit seen earlier), IV tPA is recommended as first-line therapy. The decision remains similar even in patients who have been intubated, provided airway management and supportive care are ensured. In pregnancy and lactation, treatment with tPA is considered on a case-by-case basis, weighing risks and benefits, though available data remain limited.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (CTA) is an imaging modality that can further evaluate vessel occlusion but is not a treatment. Option B (EEG) is unrelated and used to assess for seizures. Option C (tPA) is the appropriate therapeutic intervention to achieve reperfusion in an acute ischemic stroke. Option D is not provided.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Occipital strokes may present with visual hallucinations or disturbances. 2. Rapid identification and treatment with tPA are critical within the treatment window. 3. Intubation should not automatically preclude the use of tPA if other criteria are met.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nCurrent guidelines from the AHA/ASA strongly support the use of tPA in patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within the therapeutic window.

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question appears to ask for the next step in management, but the lack of clinical context (such as the underlying diagnosis or situation) makes it ambiguous. The provided options range from a surgical intervention (shunt), general anticoagulation, an unspecified 'give', or the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nWithout a clear clinical scenario, it is not possible to ascertain the underlying pathophysiological process. For instance, a shunt would be used for managing hydrocephalus, whereas LMWH is typically used for thromboembolic prophylaxis or treatment, and the generic term 'anticoagulant' could apply to multiple vascular conditions.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nThe options suggest two distinct clinical pathways: one related to neurosurgical management (shunt placement for hydrocephalus) and the other related to medical management (anticoagulation or LMWH for thromboembolism or stroke prophylaxis). Without additional patient history, imaging details, or a specific diagnosis, correlating these options to a clinical presentation is not feasible.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nA proper diagnostic workup would require detailed history, physical examination, and appropriate imaging studies to differentiate between conditions such as normal-pressure hydrocephalus, cerebral venous thrombosis, or post-stroke deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Differential diagnoses might include hydrocephalus, acute ischemic stroke with subsequent thrombosis risk, or another cerebrovascular abnormality.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement should be tailored based on the definitive diagnosis. If the issue were hydrocephalus, a shunt procedure (typically a ventriculoperitoneal shunt) would be indicated. Conversely, if the patient has a thromboembolic disorder (such as cerebral venous thrombosis or requires DVT prophylaxis post-stroke), the use of anticoagulants like LMWH is appropriate. In pregnancy and lactation, LMWH is preferred over other anticoagulants because it does not cross the placenta and has a favorable safety profile during breastfeeding.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Shunt) is correct if the underlying problem is hydrocephalus but irrelevant if the condition is thromboembolic in nature. Option B (anticoagulant) is a broad term and might be applicable in multiple scenarios but is non-specific. Option C (give) is incomplete and provides no actionable information. Option D (give LMWH) is appropriate for thromboembolic conditions (e.g., for prophylaxis in immobilized patients or in the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis) as well as for VTE prevention in high-risk patients, including those who are pregnant or lactating. However, without further context, it is impossible to choose definitively among these.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Always ensure that a question provides adequate clinical context before selecting a management option. 2. In cases of cerebrospinal fluid buildup (hydrocephalus), a shunt is indicated, while in thromboembolic conditions, anticoagulation (preferably LMWH in pregnancy/lactation) is preferred.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines underscore the importance of tailoring stroke and hydrocephalus management to the individual patient based on imaging and clinical presentation. In conditions requiring anticoagulation, LMWH remains the agent of choice in pregnant and lactating women due to its safety profile. However, current evidence also highlights the necessity of a precise diagnosis before initiating treatment.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nRuptured cerebral aneurysms, particularly those in the region of the posterior communicating artery (PCOM), lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. The core concept is that rapid hemorrhage into the subarachnoid space may cause sudden, severe headache (often described as thunderclap headache) and neurological deficits, necessitating prompt intervention to secure the aneurysm and prevent re-bleeding.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAneurysms form due to the weakening of the arterial wall and, when ruptured, cause bleeding into the subarachnoid space. This generates a rise in intracranial pressure, risk of cerebral vasospasm, and ischemic injury to surrounding brain tissue. PCOM aneurysms are common and sometimes manifest with third nerve palsy due to proximity to the oculomotor nerve.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients commonly present with a sudden, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes loss of consciousness. Specific to PCOM aneurysms, unilateral oculomotor nerve palsy with ptosis and a dilated pupil may be observed due to the compressive effects of an enlarging aneurysm or hemorrhage.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe initial diagnosis is typically made using a noncontrast CT scan to detect subarachnoid blood. This is followed by CT-angiography or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to localize the aneurysm. Differential diagnoses include perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage and hypertensive hemorrhage, which can be differentiated by the bleeding pattern and location.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nEarly securing of the aneurysm is the priority. Current guidelines suggest that endovascular coiling is preferred in many cases due to less invasiveness and favorable outcomes (as shown by the ISAT trial) if the aneurysm\u2019s anatomy is amenable. Surgical clipping remains an alternative if endovascular coiling is not feasible. Post-procedure, patients require management of vasospasm (typically with nimodipine), control of intracranial pressure, and supportive care. In pregnant patients, special considerations include minimizing radiation exposure (with appropriate shielding) and careful monitoring of fetal status during any interventional procedure, whereas during lactation, most contrast agents and anesthesia drugs are considered relatively safe with proper guidance.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Clipping) is an acceptable treatment alternative but is generally reserved for aneurysms with unfavorable coiling anatomy. Option B (Coiling), the marked answer, is preferred in many centers for PCOM aneurysms due to lower procedural morbidity. Option C (Decompressive craniotomy) is not a direct treatment for an aneurysm rupture but may be used later in cases with malignant edema. Option D (Admission to stroke unit) is inadequate as definitive management and does not secure the aneurysm.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. PCOM aneurysms can present with cranial nerve III palsy. 2. Early intervention is crucial to prevent re-bleeding and vasospasm. 3. Endovascular coiling offers a less invasive option with favorable outcomes in selected patients.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines and trials (such as ISAT) support the use of endovascular coiling in appropriate aneurysms due to reduced morbidity and similar long-term outcomes to clipping. Ongoing research is focused on further refining patient selection and improving endovascular techniques.",

In this scenario, a 56\u2010year\u2010old man was found with decreased consciousness and a known last normal time of 24 hours ago, which is well beyond the therapeutic window for thrombolytic therapy.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIschemic strokes are caused by occlusion of cerebral arteries leading to ischemia and infarction of brain tissue. The prolonged occlusion results in neuronal death and can cause significant deficits. The diminished level of consciousness could be from a large stroke or associated edema.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with ischemic stroke may present with various focal neurological deficits. A decreased level of consciousness in an elderly patient along with imaging findings on CT (even if not detailed here) necessitates prompt evaluation, though reperfusion therapies are time-sensitive.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nA noncontrast CT scan is generally performed to rule out hemorrhage. In patients presenting beyond the thrombolytic window, advanced imaging modalities like CT perfusion or MRI may be used in select cases to assess salvageable brain tissue. Differentials include hemorrhagic stroke, hypoglycemia, and seizure post-ictal states.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nGiven that the patient is outside the therapeutic window for tPA (typically within 3-4.5 hours from onset), the current evidence supports admission to a dedicated stroke unit where specialized care, supportive management, and secondary prevention strategies are initiated. For pregnant patients with stroke, management must balance maternal benefits against fetal safety, with careful use of imaging and medications. For lactating mothers, medication choices are adjusted based on excretion in breast milk.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (tPA) is contraindicated due to the elapsed time since last known well. Option B (Admission to stroke unit) is appropriate and correct as specialized stroke care can improve outcomes. Options C and D are not provided or applicable in this context.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. 'Time is brain' \u2013 rapid recognition and treatment are essential in stroke. 2. Patients discovered beyond the tPA window should be managed in a stroke unit to optimize supportive care and secondary prevention. 3. Advanced imaging may extend treatment windows in select patients but 24 hours is generally too long for standard tPA protocols.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies confirm that dedicated stroke unit care consistently improves survival and functional outcomes. Although advanced imaging techniques have allowed for extended therapy windows in some cases (e.g., DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials), these are typically limited to carefully selected patients within 24 hours and not applicable in a general scenario as described here.",
