    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nProgressive myoclonus epilepsies (PME) comprise a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by action myoclonus, seizures, and cognitive decline. Accurate diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical evaluation and neuroimaging.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nPME disorders are typically associated with progressive neuronal loss and cortical atrophy. These changes are often detectable on brain MRI, which may reveal cortical and cerebellar atrophy corresponding to the clinical manifestations of myoclonus and dementia.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with PME present with gradually worsening myoclonic jerks, seizures, and cognitive impairment. MRI findings corroborate the clinical severity by showing brain atrophy and other characteristic patterns that differentiate PME from other neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe most appropriate initial diagnostic modality is MRI, which helps visualize brain atrophy and other structural changes. Although genetic testing is definitive, MRI serves as a critical first step. Differential diagnoses include mitochondrial disorders, metabolic encephalopathies, and other causes of dementia, but their imaging profiles are distinct (e.g., lactate peaks in mitochondrial disorders).\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement is largely symptomatic, including the use of antiepileptic drugs (such as valproate and levetiracetam) for seizure control. There is no curative treatment; intervention focuses on improving quality of life and providing supportive care. In pregnant and lactating patients, careful choice of antiepileptic medications is crucial due to teratogenic potential and drug safety profiles.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nAlthough the original marked answer was D, the option analysis indicates that Option A (MRI) is the most appropriate diagnostic test for confirming the diagnosis of PME by demonstrating neurodegenerative changes. Assessments of lactate or invasive muscle biopsy are not first-line tests in this context.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. MRI is a rapid, non-invasive tool essential for the early detection of neurodegenerative changes in PME. 2. A detailed family history enhances diagnostic accuracy in suspected genetic epilepsies. 3. Following imaging, genetic testing is crucial for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nCurrent research supports the role of MRI as an invaluable screening tool in PME. Advances in genetic testing techniques are increasingly aiding in the precise categorization of these disorders, although MRI remains the cornerstone of initial evaluation.",

    "option_b": "",
    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nKearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a mitochondrial cytopathy characterized by a classic triad: progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and the onset of symptoms before the age of 20. It is a multi-system disorder affecting tissues with high-energy demands.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nKSS is caused by sporadic, large-scale deletions in mitochondrial DNA, which lead to defective energy production in affected cells. This mitochondrial dysfunction preferentially affects muscles and the nervous system, including ocular and cardiac tissues.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients typically present with ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and retinal pigmentary changes, along with possible conduction abnormalities and endocrine dysfunction. These features align well with the underlying mitochondrial defect.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nConfirmation of KSS is achieved via genetic testing demonstrating large, sporadic mitochondrial DNA deletions. Differential considerations include other forms of mitochondrial myopathy and neuromuscular disorders, but the combination of ophthalmoplegia, retinopathy, and conduction issues is characteristic of KSS.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement is primarily supportive. Cardiac conduction defects require regular monitoring and may necessitate pacemaker insertion. Other supportive treatments involve addressing endocrine abnormalities and using co-factors like coenzyme Q10. In pregnancy and lactation, careful counseling and monitoring are essential, given the risk of mitochondrial transmission; however, most cases of KSS are sporadic and do not follow a classical maternal inheritance pattern.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A, specifying a sporadic large mitochondrial DNA deletion, is correct because it accurately reflects the genetic etiology of KSS. Other options would not account for the typical mitochondrial deletion seen in this syndrome.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. KSS usually manifests before age 20 with a classic triad that includes ophthalmoplegia and pigmentary retinopathy. 2. Pay special attention to cardiac conduction abnormalities as they can necessitate urgent intervention. 3. Genetic counseling is important, especially in familial cases, despite the sporadic nature of the deletions.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies continue to support the role of mitochondrial DNA analysis in confirming KSS. Management guidelines emphasize regular cardiac screening and multidisciplinary supportive care, with ongoing research into targeted therapies for mitochondrial disorders.",

    "option_b": "hide genetic test",
    "option_c": "record him as he\u2019s having other diagnoses",
    "option_d": "respect him and record that on file",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of patient confidentiality and the ethical duty to respect a patient\u2019s wishes regarding the disclosure of sensitive genetic information. Huntington disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that carries significant social and employment implications, so the patient\u2019s autonomy and privacy must be maintained.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nHuntington disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation\u2014a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The abnormal protein product leads to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration (especially in the caudate nucleus), but the molecular pathology does not lessen the need for strict confidentiality.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nAn engineer receiving a diagnosis of Huntington disease may worry about potential employment discrimination or stigma. The ethical challenge arises when a patient explicitly states that he does not want his employer to be informed about his diagnosis. This scenario is not uncommon when dealing with genetic or stigmatizing diagnoses.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nWhile the diagnosis is established clinically and by genetic testing, the approach to handling such sensitive information revolves around strict adherence to confidentiality rules. Differential considerations might include conditions that mimic Huntington disease (such as other choreas), but here the focus is on ethical documentation rather than additional testing.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe current management underscores multidisciplinary care, including neurologic evaluation, psychiatric support, and genetic counseling. Management of confidentiality is guided by ethical principles outlined in the AMA Code of Medical Ethics and HIPAA regulations. For patients who are pregnant or lactating, genetic counseling is essential as these conditions may impact family planning and require careful discussion of risks without breaching confidentiality.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (sending an email to his employee) violates confidentiality; Option B (hiding the genetic test) mismanages medical records and transparency; Option C (recording another diagnosis) is both unethical and inaccurate. Option D (respecting his wishes and noting this in the chart) is correct as it adheres to confidentiality and documentation principles.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Always prioritize patient confidentiality, especially with stigmatizing genetic diseases. 2. Document the patient\u2019s wishes clearly in the medical record. 3. Recall that ethical principles trump unwarranted disclosure, even when third parties might be affected.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nThe latest ethical guidelines from the AMA and HIPAA emphasize patient autonomy and confidentiality. Recent discussions in medical ethics also highlight the importance of nondisclosure unless the patient gives explicit consent, particularly in the era of increased genetic testing.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question is designed to evaluate your knowledge of hereditary vascular disorders of the brain. A patient (in this case, a girl) presenting with migraine, stroke, and dementia along with a family history (affected father) is characteristic of a specific genetic small vessel disease.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nCADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. The resulting abnormality leads to degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells and accumulation of granular osmiophilic material, which in turn causes multiple subcortical infarcts and eventual cognitive decline.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with CADASIL often present with migraine-like headaches (commonly with aura), recurrent subcortical ischemic events, and early-onset dementia. The autosomal dominant inheritance (often with a paternal history) helps distinguish it from other hereditary conditions like MELAS, which follows a maternal pattern.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe diagnosis is supported by brain MRI findings (white matter hyperintensities involving the temporal poles and subcortical regions) and confirmed by genetic testing. Differential diagnoses include MELAS (characterized by stroke-like episodes and lactic acidosis, with maternal inheritance) and other causes of early stroke in young patients.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThere is no curative treatment for CADASIL. Management typically involves addressing vascular risk factors (blood pressure control, smoking cessation), symptomatic management of migraines, and supportive care for cognitive decline. In pregnant or lactating women, medication choices (such as anti-migraine drugs) require an assessment of teratogenic risks, with non-teratogenic options preferred.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A correctly identifies CADASIL. Option B (MELAS) is less likely due to differences in inheritance patterns (mitochondrial inheritance with maternal transmission) and clinical features, making it the incorrect choice.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. CADASIL should be considered in younger patients with a combination of migraine, stroke, and cognitive decline with a positive family history. 2. MRI findings (especially anterior temporal lobe involvement) are key to diagnosis. 3. Always consider the inheritance pattern when evaluating genetic disorders.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines emphasize early diagnosis via MRI and genetic testing in suspected CADASIL cases. Ongoing research looks into targeted therapies, but current management remains largely supportive and symptomatic.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question involves the interpretation of a CT brain image to identify the vascular territory involved. Knowledge of cerebral arterial anatomy and the typical imaging appearances of infarcts in various arterial territories is key to answering this question.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIschemic strokes are generally categorized based on the artery that is occluded. Each cerebral artery supplies a distinct region of the brain. For instance, an occlusion of the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) is the most common and typically produces infarcts in the lateral hemispheric region. The underlying mechanism involves thrombotic or embolic events leading to tissue infarction in the territory supplied by the culprit artery.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nClinically, an infarct in the MCA territory may present with contralateral weakness, sensory loss, or aphasia (if the dominant hemisphere is involved). CT imaging, typically performed acutely, is crucial to rule out hemorrhage and to help localize the infarcted region which correlates with the vascular territory.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes infarcts in the territories of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA), and other less common vessels. The CT imaging characteristics, coupled with clinical findings, help differentiate among these. Advanced imaging (CT angiography or MRI) can further delineate the vascular anatomy.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nImmediate management follows established stroke protocols (e.g., the \u201ctime is brain\u201d approach). First-line treatments include intravenous thrombolysis when indicated, and mechanical thrombectomy in eligible patients. In pregnant or lactating women, decisions regarding thrombolytic therapy should carefully weigh maternal benefits versus fetal risks, with current guidelines providing specific recommendations on the safe use of such interventions during pregnancy.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nAlthough the options are not fully detailed, the marked answer is Option B, which we assume represents the artery shown on the CT image (commonly the MCA is invoked in such questions). Options corresponding to other arteries (ACA, PCA, etc.) are incorrect based on the imaging findings. Without the full list, we infer that Option B best matches the territory demonstrated on the provided CT.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. The MCA is the most commonly involved artery in ischemic strokes. 2. CT brain imaging is the cornerstone of initial stroke evaluation to exclude hemorrhage and to assess infarct location. 3. Rapid identification of the vascular territory guides immediate therapeutic decisions.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent stroke guidelines stress the importance of early CT imaging and prompt reperfusion therapy. Ongoing research continues to refine criteria for thrombolysis and thrombectomy, including in special populations such as pregnant patients, ensuring that the latest protocols are followed.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question assesses your knowledge of the genetic basis of a neurodegenerative disorder. The option 'CAG trinucleotide repeat' is most classically associated with Huntington disease, which is characterized by a progressive degeneration of neurons and specific radiologic findings (such as caudate atrophy).\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nHuntington disease is caused by an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. This mutation leads to the production of an abnormal protein that accumulates within neurons, particularly in the caudate nucleus and putamen, causing cell death and resulting in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric and motor disturbances.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nThe clinical presentation typically includes choreiform movements, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms. Imaging studies (MRI or CT) often reveal atrophy of the caudate nucleus with ex vacuo dilation of the lateral ventricles. Genetic testing demonstrating an expanded CAG repeat confirms the diagnosis.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe definitive diagnosis is made through genetic testing that quantifies the number of CAG repeats. Differential diagnoses might include other trinucleotide repeat disorders (e.g., spinocerebellar ataxias), but the clinical picture and pattern of atrophy help pinpoint Huntington disease.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThere is no cure for Huntington disease; management is symptomatic and supportive. This includes medications for chorea (such as tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine), psychiatric care, and occupational therapy. For pregnant or lactating women, treatment decisions require careful consideration of fetal exposure risks, and genetic counseling is crucial for family planning.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A, 'CAG trinucleotide repeat', is the correct answer because it directly relates to the genetic mutation found in Huntington disease. Other options (not provided) would depict alternative genetic mutations not associated with this disorder.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Huntington disease is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration with prominent caudate atrophy on imaging. 2. The genetic mutation involves an expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene \u2013 more repeats correlate with earlier onset (anticipation). 3. Early genetic counseling is essential for patients and their families when facing this diagnosis.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent research in Huntington disease focuses on targeted molecular therapies including antisense oligonucleotides and other gene-silencing approaches. Current guidelines stress symptomatic management and the importance of multidisciplinary care, with ongoing trials examining potential disease-modifying therapies.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune prothrombotic disorder that frequently presents in young women with a history of recurrent pregnancy losses and thrombotic events such as stroke. The antibodies produced in APS interfere with phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests, creating a paradox where laboratory tests demonstrate prolonged clotting times while the patient remains at high risk for thrombosis.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAPS is mediated by autoantibodies (e.g., lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein I) that bind to plasma proteins associated with phospholipids, leading to endothelial cell activation, platelet aggregation, and an increased production of tissue factor. This results in a hypercoagulable state and explains both the thrombotic events, such as stroke, and the recurrent spontaneous abortions seen in these patients. Despite the in vitro prolongation of tests like the activated partial thromboplastin time, the in vivo state is one of increased clotting.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nA young female presenting with an ischemic stroke alongside a history of two abortions should prompt consideration of APS. The recurrent pregnancy loss, in the setting of abnormal clotting tests, fits the classic description of APS, making it the prime suspect in such a clinical scenario.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is established by demonstrating the persistence of antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions at least 12 weeks apart. Differential diagnoses include other thrombophilic conditions such as the prothrombin gene mutation and Factor V Leiden mutation, but the strong association of APS with obstetric complications helps in differentiating APS from these other conditions.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement of APS involves long-term anticoagulation to prevent further thrombotic events. For non-pregnant patients, vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) with INR goals tailored to risk are standard. In pregnant patients, warfarin is contraindicated due to teratogenicity; instead, a combination of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and low-dose aspirin is recommended. LMWH is also considered safe during lactation.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Antiphospholipid syndrome) is correct because the clinical scenario (ischemic stroke with a history of recurrent abortions and abnormal clotting values) is highly suggestive of APS. Option B (Prothrombin Gene Mutation) is less favored as it is not as strongly linked to recurrent pregnancy losses as APS.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. In young women with stroke and a history of recurrent miscarriages, always consider APS. 2. Laboratory tests may show prolonged clotting times paradoxically in a prothrombotic state. 3. Confirmatory antibody tests should be repeated 12 weeks apart for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines, including those from the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism, reinforce the importance of both clinical and laboratory criteria for diagnosing APS and emphasize individualized anticoagulant strategies, especially in pregnancy where LMWH is preferred.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nPost-traumatic brainstem symptoms following a road traffic accident (RTA) should raise concern for vascular injuries in the vertebrobasilar system. Traumatic dissections of cervical arteries, such as the vertebral arteries, can lead to distal embolization\u2014a phenomenon described as artery-to-artery embolism.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nBlunt trauma from an RTA may result in an intimal tear in a cervical artery, forming an intramural hematoma and eventually a thrombus. This thrombus can either occlude the vessel locally or shed emboli that travel to distal territories, including the brainstem. This artery-to-artery embolic mechanism is a recognized cause of ischemic stroke in younger individuals following trauma.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn a post-RTA patient, developing brainstem symptoms (such as vertigo, dysphagia, or ataxia) is consistent with an arterial dissection leading to embolic events in the posterior circulation. The clinical scenario strongly suggests that the underlying mechanism is related to traumatic injury of the cervical artery that subsequently embolizes.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis requires prompt imaging, with CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) to visualize the vessel wall and detect dissection. Differential diagnoses include direct traumatic brain injury (like hemorrhage or contusion) and cervical spine injury; however, the presence of vascular symptoms directs the focus toward arterial injury.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nInitial management typically involves antithrombotic therapy. The choice between antiplatelet agents and anticoagulation remains somewhat controversial, though many clinicians lean towards antiplatelet therapy based on current evidence. In pregnant patients, LMWH and low-dose aspirin are preferred due to teratogenic concerns with warfarin. The same agents are considered safe during lactation.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Artery to artery) is correct because it accurately describes the mechanism wherein a thrombus originating from a traumatic dissection embolizes to affect the brainstem. Option B (Cardioembolic) is less likely in a trauma context because there is no indication of a cardiac source for emboli.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Always consider vertebral artery dissection in patients with head/neck trauma who present with posterior circulation symptoms. 2. Early vascular imaging is crucial for diagnosis. 3. The mechanism of artery-to-artery embolism is key in translating trauma into an ischemic event.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies and guidelines emphasize the importance of early imaging with CTA/MRA in trauma patients with neurological deficits and support the use of antithrombotic therapy (either antiplatelets or anticoagulants) in the management of cervical artery dissections, with special considerations for pregnant patients.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nA right PICA (Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery) territory infarction typically affects the lateral medulla, a region containing critical cranial nerve nuclei including the nucleus ambiguus, which is involved in palatal elevation.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nInfarction due to occlusion of the PICA results in ischemia of structures in the lateral medulla. When the nucleus ambiguus is compromised, particularly on the right side, the muscles of the soft palate on that side are weakened. This leads to a relative overactivity on the contralateral (left) side, pulling the uvula toward the unaffected side.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nClinically, a patient with a right PICA infarct may present with signs of lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome, including dysphagia, hoarseness, and loss of gag reflex. The classic neurological exam finding of uvula deviation to the left is consistent with a right-sided lesion affecting the vagal-innervated musculature of the palate.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is generally confirmed with MRI, which clearly delineates the infarct in the PICA distribution. Differential considerations include other brainstem or cerebellar stroke syndromes, but the pattern of cranial nerve involvement helps localize the lesion to the lateral medulla.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAcute treatment for ischemic stroke follows standard protocols, including consideration for thrombolytic therapy if within the therapeutic window. Secondary prevention involves the use of antiplatelet agents. In pregnant patients, aspirin is preferred, while LMWH may be used if anticoagulation is indicated, and both are considered safe during lactation.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Left side uvula deviation) is correct because a right-sided lesion leads to weakness of the right palate, causing the uvula to deviate to the left. Option B (Left side Ptosis) is more aligned with sympathetic pathway involvement (Horner\u2019s syndrome) and is not a classical feature of a straightforward PICA infarct. Option C (Right body decrease sensation) is inconsistent with the typical crossed findings (ipsilateral face and contralateral body sensory loss) in lateral medullary syndrome.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. In PICA infarcts, look for signs of lateral medullary syndrome including palatal weakness and uvula deviation. 2. Uvula deviation typically occurs away from the side of the lesion. 3. MRI is the imaging modality of choice in suspected posterior circulation strokes.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent research supports the early use of advanced MRI techniques (including diffusion-weighted imaging) in the diagnosis of brainstem strokes. Updated guidelines also stress the importance of thorough neurological examination in localizing brainstem lesions such as those seen in PICA territory infarcts.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nIn the investigation of an acute ischemic stroke, particularly one localized to a specific arterial territory such as the PICA, it is paramount to directly visualize the brain parenchyma. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for detecting acute infarctions in the brain.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIschemic strokes, like those in the PICA territory, result from occlusion of an arterial supply leading to cell death in the affected region. MRI, especially diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is highly sensitive to these early ischemic changes. MR Venography (MRV) is designed to evaluate the cerebral venous system and is most useful when cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is suspected\u2014an entirely different pathologic process with distinct clinical features.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nFor a patient exhibiting classic signs of a right PICA infarction (e.g., lateral medullary syndrome features), an MRI will confirm the arterial infarct. In contrast, CVT typically presents with symptoms such as headache, seizures, and signs of raised intracranial pressure, not with the focal deficits seen in arterial strokes.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe appropriate investigation in this setting is an MRI of the brain, which provides clear visualization of the infarcted tissue. MRV should be reserved for cases where there is clinical suspicion for CVT. Lumbar puncture (LP) does not play a role in the routine evaluation of arterial strokes.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAfter confirming the diagnosis with MRI, acute management may include thrombolytic therapy if within the therapeutic window, followed by secondary prevention with antiplatelet agents and risk factor management. In pregnant patients, the use of thrombolytics must be carefully weighed against potential risks, and aspirin is often the antiplatelet agent of choice. During lactation, both aspirin (in low doses) and other approved agents are considered safe, while warfarin is avoided in pregnancy.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (MRI) is the correct investigation because it accurately images the brain parenchyma and can reliably detect infarctions in the PICA distribution. Option B (MRV) is incorrect as it is designed to evaluate the venous system for conditions such as CVT, which is not the suspected pathology in this case. Option C (LP) is not indicated in evaluating an arterial stroke.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is the investigation of choice in detecting acute ischemic strokes. 2. MRV is reserved for the assessment of cerebral venous thrombosis, which has a markedly different clinical presentation. 3. Accurate imaging is critical in determining time-sensitive stroke interventions.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nCurrent American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines endorse the use of MRI (particularly DWI sequences) in the acute setting for the detection of cerebral ischemia. Recent studies also highlight the limited role of MRV in arterial strokes, reinforcing that MRV is not indicated unless CVT is specifically suspected.",
