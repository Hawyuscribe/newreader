    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question focuses on identifying the cerebral artery involved based on a presumed clinical or radiological scenario. The Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) is the most commonly affected artery in ischemic strokes due to its direct flow from the internal carotid artery and its large territory of perfusion.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nOcclusion of the MCA typically leads to infarction in the regions of the brain it supplies. This results from thromboembolism or atherosclerotic narrowing. The large territory of the MCA means that occlusions often produce significant neurological deficits.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nClinically, an MCA stroke often manifests with contralateral weakness (especially affecting the face and arm), sensory deficits, and if the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia. Visual field deficits may also occur if the inferior division is involved.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nInitial imaging with a noncontrast CT scan is used to exclude hemorrhage. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging and CT angiography are instrumental in confirming an MCA occlusion and assessing the extent of core infarction versus salvageable penumbra. Differentials would include PCA infarction (which typically affects the occipital lobe and causes visual deficits) and anterior choroidal artery infarction (which often produces lacunar syndromes).\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nIf within the window, management of an MCA occlusion may include intravenous thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions. Guidelines emphasize rapid reperfusion therapy and supportive care. For pregnant patients, thrombolysis may be considered on a case-by-case basis with proper precautions. In lactation, most agents used in stroke care have been evaluated for safety, though individual risk assessments are needed.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (MCA) is the correct answer, as it is the most common site for ischemic strokes and fits the described scenario. Option B (PCA) supplies the occipital lobe and is less commonly involved in the typical clinical presentation presented. Option C (Anterior choroidal artery) supplies deep brain structures and would usually produce a more restricted clinical syndrome. Option D is not provided.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. The middle cerebral artery is the most commonly occluded vessel in ischemic stroke. 2. MCA territory infarcts are typically characterized by contralateral hemiparesis and aphasia if the dominant hemisphere is affected. 3. Quick identification and treatment are essential to improve outcomes.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines emphasize the role of endovascular thrombectomy in MCA occlusions, particularly in large vessel occlusions, with multiple randomized controlled trials confirming its efficacy in improving functional outcomes.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis question evaluates the understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to intracranial bleeding. The differentiation between traumatic and spontaneous hemorrhages is critical in neurology. Here, the focus is on spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage typically occurs due to rupture of small penetrating arteries, most commonly as a consequence of chronic hypertension. Long-standing high blood pressure leads to changes in the vessel wall (e.g., formation of Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms) which predispose them to rupture. Lobar hemorrhages, while a subset of ICH, are often associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, particularly in older patients.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nICH presents with the sudden onset of headache, vomiting, a decline in levels of consciousness, and focal neurological deficits. The location of the hemorrhage (deep vs. lobar) can provide clues to its etiology; hypertensive ICH frequently occurs in deep structures such as the basal ganglia or thalamus.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nA noncontrast CT scan is the diagnostic modality of choice for ICH, as it quickly differentiates hemorrhagic from ischemic strokes. MRI can be used in subacute settings for further characterization. Differential diagnoses include traumatic brain hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and lobar hemorrhage due to different etiologies such as amyloid angiopathy.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement of ICH includes rapid blood pressure control, reversal of any coagulopathy, and supportive care. Patients may require neurosurgical evaluation for hematoma evacuation if there is significant mass effect or deterioration in the neurological exam. In pregnant patients, blood pressure control must consider both maternal and fetal safety, with agents chosen that have established safety profiles. In lactating mothers, medication choices are similarly guided by safety data for breastfeeding.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Traumatic hemorrhage) is incorrect in the absence of a history of trauma. Option B (ICH) is the correct answer, representing a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, likely hypertensive in origin. Option C (Lobar hemorrhage) is a subtype of ICH but typically relates to cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the elderly and is less likely in a 56-year-old man; thus, it is less appropriate without specific supporting details. Option D is not provided.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Hypertension is the most common risk factor for spontaneous ICH. 2. Blood pressure management is crucial in the acute phase to prevent hemorrhage expansion. 3. Differentiating the hemorrhage location (deep vs. lobar) assists in identifying the underlying etiology.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nEmerging research focuses on optimal blood pressure targets and minimally invasive surgical techniques for ICH evacuation. Current guidelines recommend early aggressive management of blood pressure and individualized decisions regarding surgical intervention, with ongoing studies further refining best practices.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis case involves a patient with severe intracranial stenosis of the MCA, a high\u2010risk condition for recurrent ischemic events. The aim is to stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque and prevent embolization, making antiplatelet therapy the mainstay of management.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nSevere intracranial stenosis is most commonly due to atherosclerotic disease. The culprit lesion leads to endothelial injury and turbulent blood flow, promoting platelet activation and microembolization. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)\u2014combining aspirin\u2019s irreversible COX inhibition with clopidogrel\u2019s blockade of the ADP receptor\u2014addresses two different pathways in platelet aggregation, as demonstrated in the SAMMPRIS trial.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nClinically, patients might present with transient ischemic attacks or strokes confined to the vascular territory supplied by the affected MCA. The risk of subsequent stroke is high if the stenosis remains untreated, which makes early aggressive management essential.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nImaging modalities like CTA, MRA, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are used to confirm the degree of stenosis. Differential diagnoses include extracranial carotid stenosis, vasculitis, or other intracranial arteriopathies. Noninvasive vascular imaging usually helps differentiate these conditions.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAccording to current guidelines and the SAMMPRIS trial, the first-line management for symptomatic severe intracranial stenosis is aggressive medical therapy. DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel) should be initiated\u2014commonly for 90 days\u2014along with risk factor modification (blood pressure, lipids, glycemic control). Endovascular options (such as stenting) are reserved for cases refractory to medical management. In pregnancy or lactation, low-dose aspirin may be used safely; however, clopidogrel\u2019s safety profile is not as well established. In such scenarios, the risks and benefits should be weighed carefully, often involving a multidisciplinary discussion.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption a (DAPT) is correct because the SAMMPRIS trial demonstrated that using both aspirin and clopidogrel reduces recurrent stroke risk in severe intracranial stenosis. Other alternatives like single antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, or immediate endovascular procedures have either not shown superior benefits or carry higher procedural risks.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. The SAMMPRIS trial firmly supports DAPT in the acute management of symptomatic high-grade intracranial stenosis. 2. Aggressive medical management and risk factor modification remain the cornerstone of therapy. 3. Noninvasive imaging is key to an accurate diagnosis and subsequent management planning.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines continue to reinforce that for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease, DAPT for a period (commonly 90 days) along with intensive risk factor management is the optimal first-line approach. Endovascular intervention is reserved for selected cases when medical management fails.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nIn patients with watershed (borderzone) infarcts, it is important to evaluate the entire cerebrovascular axis as these infarcts can be related to either hemodynamic compromise or proximal large vessel disease. Noninvasive vascular imaging is pivotal in clarifying the cause.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nBorderzone or watershed infarcts occur at the junctions between vascular territories, often due to hypoperfusion or embolic events affecting both intracranial and extracranial vessels. In patients with ESRD, who may have vascular calcifications and concomitant atherosclerosis, assessing both extra- and intracranial vasculature is crucial.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn the setting of ESRD and borderzone infarcts, the patient may have subtle neurological deficits. Given the association with renal disease, there is often extensive vascular disease, making comprehensive vascular imaging essential for further management.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nA CT angiography (CTA) that ideally includes both the intracranial and neck vessels is preferred. Although the option provided mentions brain CTA (which might imply that neck vessels are included as per standard protocol), it is critical to assess for extracranial carotid stenosis as well. Differential diagnoses include embolic stroke from a cardiac source, vasculitis, or internal carotid occlusion.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nOnce vascular imaging is performed, management involves addressing underlying etiologies. First-line investigations include noninvasive CTA (with both brain and neck imaging) due to its rapidity and lower risk. In patients with ESRD, contrast administration must be judicious; however, in those on dialysis the risk of further renal injury is less of a concern. In scenarios involving pregnancy, alternative imaging modalities or minimized contrast protocols should be considered to reduce fetal exposure.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption a (Brain CTA) is acceptable as the next investigation if it includes imaging of the neck vessels. It is noninvasive and provides reliable information about both intracranial and extracranial vessels. Option b (Conventional angiography) is more invasive and carries a higher risk of complications including stroke, arterial injury, and contrast nephropathy, particularly in ESRD; hence, it is reserved for cases where noninvasive tests are inconclusive or for planning interventional procedures.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Watershed infarcts should prompt a full evaluation of both intra- and extracranial vasculature. 2. In ESRD patients, the use of CTA remains acceptable due to the limited concern over contrast-induced nephropathy in end-stage disease. 3. Noninvasive imaging is the preferred first step in vascular evaluation.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies endorse the use of comprehensive CTA as an effective, rapid, and safe tool for evaluating patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease. In patients with ESRD, modifications in contrast use are considered, but the overall imaging strategy remains the same.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nFor patients presenting with a minor stroke (NIHSS 3) within the treatment window, the crucial decision is whether to use IV thrombolysis to restore perfusion. Even minor deficits can be disabling, and timely reperfusion is key.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIschemic stroke results from occlusion of cerebral arteries, leading to infarction of brain tissue downstream. Thrombolytic therapy with tPA initiates enzymatic fibrinolysis of the clot, thereby restoring blood flow and potentially minimizing infarct size if administered early in the time window.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with minor stroke symptoms, like decreased sensation and mild facial weakness, may still experience significant disability. Early intervention with IV tPA can improve outcomes by re-establishing perfusion before irreversible damage ensues.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe diagnosis of an ischemic stroke is primarily based on clinical assessment and neuroimaging (typically noncontrast CT) to rule out hemorrhage. Differential diagnoses include transient ischemic attack (TIA), migraine with aura, or seizure-related deficits, but imaging along with clinical findings usually clarifies the diagnosis.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFor eligible patients presenting within 4.5 hours from symptom onset, IV thrombolysis with tPA is considered first-line therapy. Although DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel) has proven benefits in secondary prevention (as per the CHANCE and POINT trials), it does not have the reperfusion action required in the hyperacute phase. In the context of pregnancy or lactation, the use of tPA demands a rigorous risk-benefit assessment. Although tPA is not an absolute contraindication during pregnancy, caution is advised due to the potential risk of maternal and fetal hemorrhage; multidisciplinary consultation is recommended.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption a (DAPT) is incorrect as sole acute treatment because while it reduces recurrent events, it does not actively lyse the clot. Option b (tPA) is correct because clot dissolution is essential for reperfusion in the hyperacute phase of ischemic stroke. Option c (Aspirin alone) is insufficient for acute reperfusion therapy; it is used more for secondary prevention post-thrombolysis or when tPA is contraindicated.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Even minor strokes with low NIHSS scores can be disabling; timely tPA administration is crucial. 2. The therapeutic time window for tPA is 4.5 hours from symptom onset. 3. DAPT is useful for secondary prevention, not as a replacement for acute thrombolytic therapy.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association continue to recommend IV tPA within the 4.5-hour window for eligible patients, even for minor strokes if deficits are considered disabling. Multiple trials have consolidated the role of thrombolysis in acute management over antiplatelet-only strategies.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis case involves an elderly patient with a significant acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS 20) who is still within the 4.5-hour window for reperfusion therapy. The priority is to restore cerebral blood flow quickly, provided that contraindications, such as uncontrolled high blood pressure, are not present.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAcute ischemic stroke results from a sudden reduction in blood flow, leading to infarction. Intravenous thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) acts by cleaving plasminogen into plasmin, which dissolves the thrombus. Despite subtle early CT changes (e.g., insular ribbon, basal ganglia hypodensity), these findings do not preclude tPA use if they do not involve a large area of established infarction.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nThe patient\u2019s high NIHSS score indicates a severe stroke, and the presentation is consistent with a large vessel occlusion or a severe cortical/subcortical infarct. Although the blood pressure is 180/100 mmHg, it is below the threshold of >185/110 mmHg that typically necessitates aggressive antihypertensive management before thrombolysis.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nA noncontrast CT scan is used primarily to exclude hemorrhage and to identify early signs of ischemia. The decision for reperfusion therapy is based on clinical assessment, timing, and imaging. Differential diagnoses include stroke mimics such as seizure postictal states, hypoglycemia, or intracranial hemorrhage, but these are ruled out by the scan and clinical context.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFor patients within the 4.5-hour window, IV thrombolysis with tPA is the first-line therapy. Blood pressure management is essential only if values exceed 185/110 mmHg. Since this patient\u2019s BP is 180/100 mmHg, there is no need for pre-thrombolytic antihypertensive therapy. Mechanical thrombectomy may be considered subsequently if large vessel occlusion is confirmed, but the immediate priority is IV tPA. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of tPA is a challenging decision; although not an absolute contraindication, careful assessment by a multidisciplinary team is essential to balance maternal benefits versus risks to the fetus.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption a (Labetalol) is incorrect because the patient\u2019s blood pressure is already below the threshold that would mandate reduction prior to thrombolysis. Option b (Thrombolysis) is correct because the patient is within the therapeutic window and meets criteria for acute reperfusion therapy. Option c (Thrombectomy) is not the immediate next step without vascular imaging confirmation of a large vessel occlusion and is typically adjunctive to tPA rather than a substitute in this scenario.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. For tPA eligibility, the blood pressure must be <185/110 mmHg; values slightly below this threshold do not require pre-treatment antihypertensives. 2. Early ischemic changes on CT do not automatically exclude patients from thrombolysis. 3. In high NIHSS strokes, prompt reperfusion therapy is crucial to salvage penumbral tissue.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nContemporary guidelines from AHA/ASA continue to support IV thrombolysis with tPA within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in eligible patients. Recent studies emphasize that strict blood pressure management prior to tPA is warranted only when levels exceed the set threshold, reinforcing that timely reperfusion is the critical factor in improving outcomes.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\ntPA-induced angioedema is a recognized complication of thrombolytic therapy. It is thought to be mediated by an increase in bradykinin levels that causes vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, resulting in localized swelling\u2014often seen in the tongue or facial area.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\ntPA catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which not only dissolves clots but can also lead to increased bradykinin production. Elevated bradykinin levels cause vascular leakage leading to angioedema. Patients with a history of ACE inhibitor use are at an increased risk, though it can occur independently. The underlying mechanism involves an atypical inflammatory response that is not IgE-mediated.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn this patient, although there is severe dysarthria (likely from tongue swelling affecting articulation), the airway remains uncompromised. Recognizing that the patient is stable without respiratory distress guides management away from invasive airway protection unless further compromise occurs.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe diagnosis is primarily clinical with a correlation between recent tPA administration and the onset of localized swelling. Differential diagnoses include allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, or other causes of upper airway edema. However, the timing post-tPA and the focal nature (tongue angioedema) supports the diagnosis of tPA-induced angioedema.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFirst-line treatment in tPA-induced angioedema is medical management using steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) and antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) to reduce inflammation and counter any histamine-mediated effects. Airway management (e.g., intubation) is reserved for cases with evidence of respiratory compromise or rapidly progressing edema. In pregnant or lactating patients, steroids and antihistamines are used when benefits outweigh risks; close monitoring of both mother and fetus is essential, and consultation with maternal\u2013fetal medicine is advised in severe cases.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Intubation) is inappropriate because the patient is currently stable without airway compromise\u2014intubation is indicated only when there is imminent respiratory failure or severe obstruction. Option B (Steroid with antihistamine) directly addresses the inflammatory and mediator-driven process, making it the correct initial management. Option C (ACE inhibitor with diuretics) is contraindicated because ACE inhibitors can exacerbate angioedema by further increasing bradykinin levels, and diuretics do not address the underlying issue and may worsen hemodynamics.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Always assess for airway compromise in patients with angioedema\u2014if the airway is stable, medical management is preferred. 2. tPA-induced angioedema is bradykinin-mediated, so typical anaphylaxis protocols (epinephrine) may not be effective. 3. History of concomitant ACE inhibitor use can increase the risk of this complication.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent stroke management guidelines acknowledge tPA-induced angioedema as a rare complication and recommend early medical management with steroids and antihistamines. Studies emphasize that prompt recognition and treatment can prevent progression to airway obstruction, reducing the overall morbidity associated with thrombolytic therapy.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nTransient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) associated with atrial flutter are typically the result of cardioembolic events. In nonvalvular atrial flutter, thrombus formation within the atria can lead to embolization and subsequent neurological deficits.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAtrial flutter results in rapid, regular atrial contractions that foster blood stasis, particularly in the atrial appendage, thereby increasing the risk of thrombus formation. These emboli may dislodge and travel to cerebral vasculature causing TIAs or strokes. Although the echocardiogram is normal (suggesting no structural heart disease), the arrhythmia itself remains the source of embolism.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nA patient with atrial flutter and TIA is at significant risk for future strokes of embolic origin. Recognizing the cardioembolic mechanism is essential for instituting appropriate long\u2010term anticoagulation to prevent recurrence.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed through ECG demonstrating atrial flutter. Echocardiography is used to rule out structural abnormalities but does not exclude the risk posed by the arrhythmia. Differential diagnoses include TIAs from large artery atherosclerosis or small vessel disease, which typically have different risk profiles and management strategies.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe latest guidelines recommend the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), particularly Factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., apixaban, rivaroxaban), as first-line therapy for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. In the acute setting following a TIA, early initiation of appropriate anticoagulation is indicated. For pregnant patients, however, DOACs are contraindicated due to teratogenicity and limited safety data; low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred in such cases. Similar caution applies during lactation, with LMWH being considered safer.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Factor Xa inhibitor) is correct as these agents have been shown to reduce the risk of cardioembolic stroke effectively. The marked answer was B, which is incorrect. Other potential options might include antiplatelet therapy or solely using rate-control medications, but these do not address the embolic risk adequately.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Atrial flutter and fibrillation both confer a high risk for cardioembolic events, necessitating prompt anticoagulation. 2. Echocardiography may be normal in these patients despite significant embolic risk. 3.

This swelling can lead to herniation syndromes, which are life-threatening. Decompressive hemicraniectomy is performed to alleviate the pressure, thereby reducing the risk of secondary brain injury.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients typically present with decreased level of consciousness, hemiparesis, and signs of raised ICP. The rapid deterioration seen in malignant MCA infarcts correlates with the underlying pathophysiology of uncontrollable edema and midline shift.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed via neuroimaging such as CT or MRI, which shows a large infarct territory, midline shift, and signs of herniation. Differential diagnoses include intracerebral hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis; however, the imaging characteristics and clinical setting help distinguish malignant MCA infarction.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe first-line treatment to change outcomes in malignant MCA infarction is decompressive hemicraniectomy, ideally performed within 24\u201348 hours of symptom onset, as multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated improved survival and functional outcomes. Supportive care in a specialized stroke unit is essential but not sufficient as a standalone intervention. In pregnant patients, decompressive surgery may still be indicated when maternal life is at risk; multidisciplinary management involving neurosurgery, obstetrics, and neonatology is critical.

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nStroke involving the territory of the Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA) can affect lateral midbrain and cerebellar structures. The involvement of descending sympathetic fibers leads to the development of ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, manifesting as ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe SCA supplies parts of the lateral midbrain and upper cerebellum. Ischemia in this region may disrupt sympathetic pathways that run adjacent to these structures, thereby causing ipsilateral Horner's syndrome. The disruption is due to infarction of small fibers that regulate sympathetic outflow.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with SCA stroke may present with cerebellar signs such as ataxia along with additional features like ipsilateral Horner's syndrome. Recognition of these signs assists in localizing the lesion to the lateral midbrain and SCA territory.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nNeuroimaging including MRI and CT angiography are used to delineate the affected vascular territory. The differential diagnosis includes lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome, midbrain infarcts from other arterial distributions, and other brainstem pathologies. Isolated 4th nerve palsies usually point to lesions in the dorsal midbrain, which are less typical in SCA infarcts.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement of SCA infarcts is largely supportive and similar to other ischemic strokes with antithrombotic therapy initiation, risk factor modification, and rehabilitation. In the acute setting, if the patient is within the thrombolytic window and meets criteria, IV thrombolysis may be considered. In pregnant or lactating patients, the risk\u2013benefit analysis of thrombolytic therapy is performed on a case-by-case basis, with current guidelines advising cautious use when indicated.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption 1 (Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome) is correct because it is a classic clinical finding that results from involvement of sympathetic fibers in the lateral midbrain adjacent to the SCA territory. Option 2 (4th cranial nerve palsy) is incorrect, as isolated trochlear nerve involvement is uncommon in SCA infarcts and usually suggests a different midbrain lesion location.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome is a key lateralizing sign in strokes involving the lateral midbrain or upper brainstem. 2. Recognize that posterior circulation strokes have unique clinical syndromes compared to anterior circulation strokes. 3. Detailed neuro-ophthalmologic examination can significantly aid in lesion localization.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent reviews of posterior circulation stroke syndromes consolidate the finding that sympathetic pathway involvement, leading to ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, is a reliable clinical sign in SCA territory infarcts. Advanced imaging techniques continue to refine our understanding of the vascular territories involved in brainstem strokes.",
