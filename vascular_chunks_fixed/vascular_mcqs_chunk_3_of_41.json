    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThe Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA) supplies the superior portion of the cerebellum, including parts of the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. In vascular neuroimaging, identifying which arterial territory is involved is based on the location of the infarct or lesion seen on imaging.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAn infarct in the SCA territory typically results from thromboembolism or atherosclerotic occlusion. The resulting ischemia affects the regions of the cerebellum responsible for coordination, balance, and fine motor control. Recent studies and imaging techniques (such as high-resolution MRI) have improved our ability to differentiate between infarcts in different cerebellar vascular territories.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with an SCA infarct may present with ataxia, dysmetria, and difficulty with coordinated movements due to involvement of the superior cerebellum. These symptoms help differentiate an SCA stroke from other posterior circulation strokes (e.g., PICA infarcts may involve lateral medullary signs, whereas AICA strokes often involve hearing loss and facial paralysis).\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nOnce clinical signs suggest a cerebellar involvement, neuroimaging is essential. Differential diagnoses include infarcts in the PICA (lateral medullary syndrome), AICA (lateral pontine syndrome), and even occipital infarcts (PCA territory). MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is highly sensitive, and CT scans may initially be used to rule out hemorrhage.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAcute management involves rapid stroke evaluation and consideration for thrombolysis if within the treatment window, along with supportive and rehabilitative care. First-line therapy is usually IV thrombolysis (if eligible) and sometimes endovascular therapy. In pregnant or lactating women, CT and MRI protocols are adjusted to minimize radiation exposure; IV thrombolysis has been used with caution when benefits outweigh risks.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Posterior cerebral artery) involves the occipital lobe, not the cerebellum; Option B (PICA) supplies the inferior cerebellum and lateral medullary region; Option D (AICA) affects parts of the lateral pons and inner ear structures. Thus, Option C correctly matches the infarct location seen in the imaging.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1) Localization of stroke based on vascular territories is critical for proper diagnosis. 2) SCA strokes typically present with gait ataxia and dysmetria. 3) Differentiating cerebellar vascular territories helps tailor management and anticipate complications.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent advances underscore the importance of rapid imaging with MRI/DWI in diagnosing posterior circulation strokes. Updated stroke guidelines emphasize the timely use of thrombolysis and endovascular therapy, even in posterior circulation strokes, with careful adjustments in special populations such as pregnant or lactating women.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nPostpartum women are at increased risk for hypercoagulable states, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a key consideration when a young female presents with severe headache and photophobia. The use of appropriate venographic imaging helps confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nCVST involves thrombosis in the cerebral venous system, leading to impaired venous drainage, raised intracranial pressure, and resultant neurological symptoms. The postpartum period is particularly risky due to physiological changes and a hypercoagulable state. Recent studies emphasize early detection and prompt anticoagulation therapy to improve outcomes.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nSevere headache, often accompanied by photophobia, nausea, and sometimes focal neurological deficits, are hallmark signs of CVST. In the postpartum period, these symptoms should raise significant concern for this diagnosis.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, migraines, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and meningitis. Brain CT venography is a rapid and accessible imaging modality that is highly useful for diagnosing CVST. Alternatively, MR venography can be used when available, especially when radiation avoidance is a priority.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFirst-line management involves anticoagulation therapy (typically low molecular weight heparin) even in the presence of hemorrhagic transformation. In pregnant or lactating women, LMWH is considered safe and is the treatment of choice. Subsequent management includes supportive care and addressing potential complications such as raised intracranial pressure.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Brain CT venography) is the appropriate imaging study to confirm CVST and is rapidly available in emergency settings. The other options are either not provided or not relevant to the investigation of CVST.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1) Always consider a hypercoagulable work-up in postpartum women with headaches. 2) CT venography is a preferred initial study for CVST due to its rapid availability. 3) Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of CVST management even if hemorrhage is present.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines support early diagnosis of CVST with CT or MR venography and the initiation of anticoagulation therapy. There is also increasing emphasis on the safety profile of LMWH in pregnancy and lactation, with robust evidence favoring its use in these populations.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThe visual field defect described in picture B is consistent with a lesion in the occipital lobe. The Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) supplies this region, and occlusion typically leads to contralateral homonymous hemianopia with potential macular sparing.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nOcclusion of the PCA leads to an ischemic stroke in the occipital lobe. This region of the brain is responsible for processing visual information. The phenomenon of macular sparing occurs because the macular region often receives collateral blood flow from the middle cerebral artery.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with PCA infarctions commonly present with visual field deficits, such as contralateral homonymous hemianopia. The presence of macular sparing is a key clinical indicator that helps differentiate PCA strokes from lesions in the visual pathways elsewhere.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes lesions in the optic radiation (which may produce similar deficits but typically lack macular sparing), retinal pathologies involving the ophthalmic artery, and infarcts of the anterior or posterior choroidal arteries. Neuroimaging with MRI, especially diffusion-weighted imaging, can confirm the diagnosis and the specific vascular territory involved.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement follows the acute ischemic stroke protocols (e.g., IV thrombolysis if within the therapeutic window, antiplatelet therapy, and supportive measures). For pregnant or lactating patients, careful imaging choices (MRI without gadolinium when possible) and adjusted therapeutic interventions are recommended according to current guidelines.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Anterior choroidal artery) mainly affects deep structures such as the internal capsule and thalamus; Option B (Posterior choroidal artery) is less commonly implicated in isolated visual field defects; Option C (Ophthalmic artery) involves the retina and would produce different visual findings. Option D (Posterior cerebral artery) is the only artery whose occlusion classically results in the described occipital lobe infarct and corresponding visual field defect, making it the correct answer.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1) Macular sparing is a key sign pointing to PCA involvement. 2) Visual field deficits in stroke are typically due to occipital lobe involvement. 3) A careful history and imaging correlation are essential in differentiating between retinal and cerebral causes of visual loss.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nCurrent stroke guidelines emphasize rapid neuroimaging for suspected PCA infarcts. Research into advanced neuroimaging techniques has further refined our ability to localize ischemia within the posterior circulation and guide prompt therapeutic intervention.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nAfter identification of a visual field defect suggestive of a PCA stroke, the next step is to confirm the vascular occlusion using imaging that can visualize the cerebral arteries. This confirmation is crucial for guiding acute stroke management.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAn occlusion of the PCA leads to ischemia in the occipital lobe responsible for processing visual information. Confirming the occlusion helps in establishing the diagnosis and in planning appropriate acute management, including thrombolysis or endovascular interventions if within the appropriate time window.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nThe patient\u2019s visual field deficit, in this context, directs the clinician to suspect a PCA infarct. Confirmatory vascular imaging not only reinforces the diagnosis but also helps exclude other potential causes of visual loss such as retinal artery occlusion or other intracranial vascular pathologies.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe main differentials in this setting include other causes of visual deficits such as optic neuritis, retinal artery occlusion, or lesions in the optic radiation. Brain CT angiography (CTA) offers a rapid method to visualize arterial occlusion and is widely available in most emergency departments, making it the preferred next step in the acute setting.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFirst-line management includes rapid imaging confirmation (via CT angiography) to assess the occlusion. Subsequent management follows acute ischemic stroke protocols including IV thrombolysis if indicated and endovascular therapy if within the appropriate time window. In pregnant or lactating women, minimizing radiation is critical. When using CTA, protective measures should be taken, or if available, an MRI/MRA without gadolinium can be considered as an alternative.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Brain CT Angio) is the recommended and most practical imaging technique to confirm a suspected PCA occlusion. The marked answer Option B is not defined with any content, making it an unsuitable choice. Options C and D are not provided, but among the available options, CTA is the gold standard in the emergency setting.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1) In suspected PCA infarcts, vascular imaging with CT angiography is essential for confirmation. 2) Rapid confirmation of the occlusion can help determine eligibility for thrombolytic or endovascular therapy. 3) In pregnant and lactating patients, imaging choices should balance diagnostic yield with safety considerations.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent stroke guidelines and research emphasize the role of CT angiography in the rapid evaluation of acute ischemic stroke in posterior circulation. Studies have shown that timely CTA significantly improves outcomes by allowing prompt therapeutic decisions, and emerging protocols continue to optimize imaging strategies in vulnerable populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nUnruptured intracranial aneurysms are often detected incidentally when patients are investigated for unrelated complaints (such as chronic headache). The management strategy is based on aneurysm size, location, morphology, and patient risk factors. Small aneurysms, especially those around 3 mm in diameter, have a very low risk of rupture and are usually managed conservatively.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAneurysms develop due to weakening of the arterial wall from factors like hemodynamic stress and degenerative changes. Rupture risk correlates with the size of the aneurysm and its location. A 3 mm aneurysm, commonly found in the anterior circulation, possesses a minimal rupture risk. Studies indicate that the natural history of such small aneurysms is generally benign when other high\u2010risk features are absent.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn a patient with a chronic headache, finding a small (3 mm) aneurysm without any focal neurological deficits or signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage suggests an incidental lesion. The patient\u2019s clinical stability supports a non-interventional approach with periodic imaging follow-up rather than immediate invasive treatment.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe initial diagnosis is made with noninvasive imaging such as CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA). For small aneurysms, serial imaging (typically 6\u201312 months intervals) is recommended to monitor for any changes in size or morphology. Differential diagnoses include other vascular malformations, but the clear identification of an aneurysmal outpouching confines the diagnosis.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe first-line management for an asymptomatic, small unruptured aneurysm is conservative observation. This includes periodic imaging follow\u2013up (often at around 6 months) and risk factor modification (control of hypertension, smoking cessation). In patients who are pregnant or lactating, non-ionizing imaging modalities like MRA (avoiding gadolinium if possible) are preferred, and invasive procedures are generally deferred unless absolutely indicated.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A: 'Observe and follow in 6 months' is appropriate and aligns with current guidelines for a small (3 mm) unruptured aneurysm. Other options involving intervention (endovascular coiling or surgical clipping) would be considered overtreatment given the very low rupture risk.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Aneurysm rupture risk is strongly size-dependent\u2014aneurysms <5 mm in the anterior circulation are generally observed. 2. Serial imaging is the key to safely monitoring these lesions. 3. Risk factor management (e.g., hypertension control, smoking cessation) is critical in all patients.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines from the American Heart Association and neurosurgical societies endorse a conservative approach for small, asymptomatic aneurysms, emphasizing observation with serial imaging. Emerging evidence continues to support that invasive intervention is reserved for larger or high-risk aneurysms.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a critical condition characterized by bleeding into the subarachnoid space. However, not all SAHs are due to aneurysm rupture. Perimesencephalic SAH, a subset of nonaneurysmal SAH, has a distinct CT appearance and a markedly better prognosis.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nPerimesencephalic SAH is thought to result from a venous or small arterial bleed in the area surrounding the midbrain (the perimesencephalic cisterns). Unlike aneurysmal SAH, it is not associated with ruptured aneurysms and tends to confine to the perimesencephalic cisterns, with no evidence of blood in the sylvian fissures or other cisterns.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nClinically, patients may present with a sudden severe headache, though the clinical course is typically benign compared to aneurysmal SAH. The typical CT finding is localized blood in the perimesencephalic region with no extension into other brain cisterns, which helps differentiate it from aneurysmal SAH.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe initial diagnostic modality is a noncontrast head CT to detect subarachnoid blood. Once a perimesencephalic pattern is identified, it is standard to perform vascular imaging (CTA or digital subtraction angiography) to rule out an aneurysm. Differential diagnoses include aneurysmal SAH (which typically shows a more diffuse blood distribution) and other causes of intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe management is largely supportive, including blood pressure control, pain management, and sometimes the use of nimodipine to help prevent vasospasm, though vasospasm is less common in perimesencephalic SAH. In pregnant or lactating women, supportive care is similarly applied, with careful selection of medications to minimize fetal or neonatal risk.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A ('Perimesencephalic hemorrhage SAH') is the correct answer when the CT scan shows a blood distribution centered around the midbrain with sparing of other cisterns. Other potential options (if provided) might have included aneurysmal SAH or other hemorrhagic patterns, which are excluded by the localized pattern seen here.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Perimesencephalic SAH carries a much lower risk of complications and rebleeding than aneurysmal SAH. 2. The typical CT distribution is key for an accurate diagnosis. 3. Confirmatory vascular imaging is still important to definitively exclude aneurysms.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies and guidelines support the conservative management of perimesencephalic SAH due to its benign natural history. The avoidance of aggressive interventions unless imaging reveals aneurysmal origins has been reinforced by current research.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nBrain MRI is an essential tool for evaluating the mechanism of ischemic events. One common mechanism depicted on MRI is cerebral ischemia due to hemodynamic compromise, often seen in watershed regions between major cerebral arteries. Severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis is a well-known cause of such hemodynamic failure.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nICA stenosis, usually from atherosclerotic disease, leads to reduced cerebral perfusion. This can result in watershed or borderzone infarcts\u2014ischemic lesions that occur between the territories of the major cerebral arteries. The MRI will typically show infarcts in these borderzone areas, supporting the mechanism of hypoperfusion rather than embolism or small vessel occlusion.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with significant ICA stenosis may experience transient ischemic attacks or full-blown strokes, often with deficits corresponding to the affected vascular territories. The ischemic changes on MRI, particularly in watershed zones, are indicative of a hemodynamic mechanism linked to severe carotid narrowing.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed through vascular imaging modalities like carotid Doppler ultrasound, CTA, or MRA, which assess the degree of ICA stenosis. Differential diagnoses include embolic stroke (from cardiac sources) or small vessel disease, but the watershed distribution and vascular studies help differentiate ICA stenosis-related ischemia from these conditions.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe first-line management of symptomatic ICA stenosis involves aggressive medical management\u2014including antiplatelet therapy, statins, and risk factor modification (control of hypertension, smoking cessation). In cases of severe stenosis in symptomatic patients, revascularization via carotid endarterectomy or stenting is recommended. In pregnant patients, the risks of interventional procedures must be balanced with medical therapy, using medications that are safe in pregnancy (e.g., certain antiplatelets and statins may be contraindicated, so tailored management is necessary). Lactating women are managed similarly, with careful consideration of drug safety.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A ('ICA stenosis') is correct if the MRI shows infarct patterns typical of a watershed distribution. Other mechanisms might include cardioembolism or small vessel disease, but these are less consistent with the described MRI pattern. Thus, ICA stenosis is the most plausible explanation given the information.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Watershed infarcts on MRI are a red flag for hemodynamic compromise due to carotid stenosis. 2. Vascular imaging is essential in determining the degree of stenosis. 3. Management is a combination of medical therapy and possible revascularization in symptomatic severe cases.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent trials continue to support the role of carotid revascularization in select symptomatic patients with high-grade stenosis, while emphasizing aggressive medical management in most cases. Guidelines stress individualized therapy based on imaging findings and clinical presentation.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nCardioembolic strokes are a distinct subtype of ischemic stroke, where the source of embolization is cardiac in origin. In patients with cardiac wall motion abnormalities (often described as ventricular hypokinesia), blood stasis can lead to thrombus formation, which may subsequently embolize to cerebral arteries.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAreas of ventricular hypokinesia, frequently due to previous myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy, create conditions for blood stasis. This stasis predisposes to the formation of an intraventricular thrombus, which can dislodge and travel to the brain, causing an ischemic stroke. The management involves anticoagulation to prevent further thrombus formation and embolization.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with a history of cardiac dysfunction and evidence of wall motion abnormalities (as seen on echocardiography) who develop an ischemic stroke are typically suspected of having a cardioembolic mechanism. This guides the clinician toward the use of anticoagulant therapy rather than solely antiplatelet agents.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nEchocardiography is the main diagnostic tool for identifying left ventricular thrombi and assessing wall motion. Differential diagnoses include atherosclerotic stroke or small vessel (lacunar) stroke, but the presence of an echocardiographic abnormality points to a cardioembolic source. Additional workup might include cardiac MRI or contrast studies for further delineation.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe primary treatment for cardioembolic stroke due to a ventricular thrombus is systemic anticoagulation. Warfarin has been the traditional first-line therapy with a target INR typically between 2 and 3, and is supported by a body of evidence in preventing recurrent embolic events. Although non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are preferred in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, their use in patients with left ventricular thrombus is off\u2013label and not yet supported by robust evidence. Antiplatelet therapies like aspirin or clopidogrel are not sufficient in this setting. In the context of pregnancy, warfarin is contraindicated due to its teratogenicity; low molecular weight heparin is the preferred anticoagulant. In lactating women, warfarin is generally safe, though careful monitoring is still warranted.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A ('Warfarin') is the correct treatment choice for a cardioembolic stroke in the setting of ventricular hypokinesia. NOACs (Option B) do not have established evidence in this specific scenario. Options C and D (aspirin and clopidogrel) are antiplatelet agents and do not provide adequate protection against thrombus formation from a low-flow cardiac source.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Cardioembolic strokes require anticoagulation rather than mere antiplatelet therapy. 2. Warfarin remains the gold standard for treating left ventricular thrombus despite emerging interest in NOACs. 3. In pregnant patients, warfarin is contraindicated\u2014LMWH should be used instead.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines reaffirm the role of warfarin for patients with left ventricular thrombus and cardioembolic stroke. While newer agents are under investigation, current large-scale studies and clinical practice continue to support warfarin as first\u2013line therapy in this setting, with adjustments made for special populations like pregnant women.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nCADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary small vessel disease. The condition typically presents with migraine (often with aura), recurrent subcortical ischemic events, and progressive cognitive decline. The definitive diagnosis relies on identifying the pathogenic mutation in the NOTCH3 gene.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nMutations in the NOTCH3 gene lead to abnormal protein accumulation in the smooth muscle cells of small arteries. This results in degeneration of the vascular smooth muscle with the accumulation of granular osmiophilic deposits (GOM) and subsequent compromise in blood flow. These changes produce the characteristic white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts seen on imaging.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients typically present with migraine with aura, mood disturbances, and eventual cognitive impairment. The cerebrovascular insufficiency due to microangiopathy manifests as lacunar strokes, which are central to the clinical presentation of CADASIL.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe most specific diagnostic test is genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations. Supportive findings include MRI features such as white matter hyperintensities (especially in the anterior temporal lobes), but these are not definitive. Skin biopsy can show GOM deposits but has less sensitivity and specificity, and is reserved for equivocal cases. Differential diagnoses include other causes of small vessel disease such as sporadic lacunar stroke, multiple sclerosis, and other hereditary leukoencephalopathies.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThere is no cure for CADASIL; treatment is supportive and aims to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Migraine is managed symptomatically, while vascular risk factor modification (e.g., controlling blood pressure, avoiding smoking) is crucial. Genetic counseling is important for affected families. In pregnancy and lactation, careful coordination is necessary to manage migraines and vascular risk factors with medications that are safe for the fetus or infant.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption B (genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations) is correct because it is the definitive diagnostic modality. Option A (skin biopsy) is only supportive and is less sensitive and specific. Option C (MRI alone) reveals characteristic but nonspecific findings that overlap with other small vessel pathologies. Option D (CSF analysis) and Option E (routine blood tests) are non-diagnostic in CADASIL.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. NOTCH3 gene mutation testing is the gold standard for diagnosing CADASIL. 2. MRI commonly shows white matter hyperintensities with a predilection for the anterior temporal lobes. 3. Skin biopsy can be used when genetic testing is inconclusive but is not first-line.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines reaffirm the importance of genetic testing for CADASIL given its specificity. Advances in imaging have helped in raising suspicion, but the definitive diagnosis continues to rely on molecular methods.

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nAcute neurologic events such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the context of severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis require prompt evaluation to prevent a full-blown stroke. Symptomatic high-grade ICA stenosis has been shown to benefit significantly from surgical intervention.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAtherosclerotic plaque buildup in the ICA can lead to severe stenosis, which predisposes to embolic events. In symptomatic patients, the unstable plaque can cause TIAs or strokes due to embolization or hemodynamic compromise.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with severe, symptomatic ICA stenosis may have transient focal neurological deficits corresponding to the affected vascular territory. The presence of TIA in this setting is a warning sign for an impending stroke.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nInitial evaluation includes carotid duplex ultrasonography to determine the degree of stenosis, followed by confirmatory imaging such as CT angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Differential diagnoses include intracranial atherosclerosis, cardioembolic stroke, and small vessel disease, which can be differentiated based on imaging and clinical findings.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFor patients with symptomatic severe ICA stenosis, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the first-line treatment as recommended by current guidelines (e.g., American Heart Association/American Stroke Association). Carotid angioplasty plus stenting (CAS) is generally reserved for patients who are poor surgical candidates or have specific anatomical considerations. In pregnancy, intervention requires multidisciplinary coordination, as both surgery and stenting carry risks; management should minimize exposure to radiation and contrast, and timing of intervention may be modified until postpartum if feasible.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (angioplasty plus stenting) is a less favored first-line therapy in typical cases unless the patient is a high surgical risk. Option B (male 50 shunting) appears to be irrelevant and not supported by guidelines. Option C (endarterectomy) is the guideline-supported intervention for symptomatic severe ICA stenosis and is therefore correct.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Carotid endarterectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis >70%. 2. Careful patient selection is essential when considering surgical versus endovascular approaches. 3. Noninvasive imaging (duplex ultrasound, CTA, MRA) plays a critical role in evaluation.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent updates in vascular stroke guidelines continue to support the use of CEA in symptomatic patients with high-grade stenosis. Endovascular approaches remain secondary options for those deemed high risk for surgery, and ongoing trials are comparing long-term outcomes between surgical and stenting approaches.",
