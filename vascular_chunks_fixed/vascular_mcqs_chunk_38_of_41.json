    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia is a chronic pain condition characterized by sudden, brief, and lancinating facial pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. It is often triggered by minimal stimulation such as light touch, speaking, or chewing.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe classic form of trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by a neurovascular conflict, where an artery (commonly the superior cerebellar artery) compresses the trigeminal nerve root, leading to demyelination. This demyelination results in ectopic nerve firing and paroxysmal pain.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients typically report episodes of severe, sharp, electric shock-like pain that lasts for seconds. These episodes can be triggered by everyday activities and severely impact quality of life.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nWhile the diagnosis is primarily clinical, high-resolution MRI can be used to confirm the presence of a vascular loop compressing the nerve. Differential diagnoses include postherpetic neuralgia, dental causes of facial pain, and atypical facial pain syndromes.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFirst-line treatment is with anticonvulsant medications, with carbamazepine being the drug of choice due to its efficacy in reducing neural hyperexcitability. If patients do not respond or experience intolerable side effects, second-line options include oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, or surgical treatments (such as microvascular decompression) in refractory cases. In pregnant patients, carbamazepine is associated with teratogenicity (FDA Category D) and must be used with caution\u2014alternative agents or careful risk-benefit analysis is advised. For lactating mothers, the use of carbamazepine requires monitoring of the infant due to possible drug exposure via breast milk.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption B (carbamazepine) is correct as it is the first-line medical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. Option A (decompressive surgery) is typically reserved for patients who are refractory to medical management.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Trigeminal neuralgia is often described as electric shock-like facial pain triggered by everyday activities. 2. Carbamazepine is the first-line therapy, but surgical options exist for refractory cases.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies continue to support carbamazepine as the first-line medication for trigeminal neuralgia, with ongoing research into optimizing dosing strategies and exploring surgical interventions for patients who do not respond adequately to medical therapy.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic neurocutaneous disorder characterized by distinctive skin findings such as caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, neurofibromas, and sometimes associated neurobehavioral issues like ADHD. It is one of the most common genetically inherited disorders affecting the skin and nervous system.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nNF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which codes for neurofibromin\u2014a tumor suppressor protein involved in the regulation of cell growth. Loss of neurofibromin function leads to abnormal cell proliferation and the development of neurofibromas, along with pigmentary skin changes. Additionally, neurodevelopmental issues such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently observed.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn pediatric patients presenting with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and behavioral symptoms such as ADHD, NF1 should be strongly considered. The presence of multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait macules is a hallmark feature of NF1, differentiating it from NF2, which more commonly presents with bilateral vestibular schwannomas and lacks the pigmentary abnormalities.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis of NF1 is primarily clinical, based on NIH diagnostic criteria which include: six or more caf\u00e9-au-lait macules (of a specified size), neurofibromas or a family history, freckling in the axillary/inguinal regions, Lisch nodules, and bony dysplasia. Differential diagnoses include other neurocutaneous syndromes such as NF2 and Legius syndrome, with distinctive features differentiating them.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement of NF1 is multidisciplinary and focuses on monitoring for complications such as optic pathway gliomas, skeletal abnormalities, and learning disabilities including ADHD. Behavioral issues are managed using standard ADHD therapies with consideration of age and individual tolerability; however, potential side effects of medications (e.g., stimulant-associated appetite suppression or sleep disturbances) should be monitored. In pregnant patients with NF1, there is an increased risk of complications such as hypertension and tumor growth, necessitating close surveillance. There are no specific contraindications during lactation, though management should be individualized.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption 1 (NF1) is correct because the combination of caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and ADHD is classic for Neurofibromatosis type 1. Option 2 (NF2) is incorrect as it primarily manifests with bilateral vestibular schwannomas and does not typically include the pigmentary or neurobehavioral features seen in NF1.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Caf\u00e9-au-lait macules are a key dermatologic clue to NF1 in children. 2. NF1 is frequently associated with neurodevelopmental issues such as ADHD, necessitating early behavioral evaluation and intervention.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent research has focused on genotype-phenotype correlations in NF1 and early intervention strategies for neurodevelopmental disorders. Updated consensus guidelines emphasize regular multidisciplinary screening for complications, including routine ophthalmologic and neurological evaluations.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nA posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory infarction is a type of ischemic stroke affecting the posterior circulation. The mainstay of management for most ischemic strokes, when thrombolysis is not pursued or is contraindicated, is antithrombotic therapy, with current guidelines supporting dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in selected cases (e.g., minor stroke) to reduce early recurrence.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nOcclusion of the PICA leads to ischemia in the portions of the cerebellum (and possibly lateral medulla) it supplies. The resulting infarction may cause local tissue damage with risk for edema and, in some cases, mass effect. In many cases without large swelling or compressive effects, the infarction is managed medically.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with PICA infarctions can present with symptoms such as vertigo, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes features of lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome if the medulla is involved. The clinical picture, along with CT (or MRI) imaging, guides management decisions.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nInitial imaging with non-contrast CT is used to rule out hemorrhage and identify infarction. Differential diagnoses include cerebellar hemorrhage, brainstem lesions, and posterior fossa neoplasms. MRI imaging may provide additional detail if needed. The clinical context (size of infarct, presence of edema) guides whether neurosurgical consultation is later required if there is a risk of brainstem compression.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFor an acute ischemic stroke in a non\u2010thrombolysis candidate or after thrombolysis, current guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy. In patients with minor stroke (often defined with low NIHSS scores) dual antiplatelet therapy \u2013 typically aspirin plus clopidogrel \u2013 is recommended for a short duration (commonly 21 to 90 days) to reduce early recurrent stroke risk. In patients who are pregnant or lactating, low-dose aspirin is generally considered acceptable when needed; clopidogrel may be used with caution, although risks and benefits should be carefully weighed with specialist consultation.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Neurosurgery consultation) is generally reserved for patients with significant cerebellar edema or mass effect leading to neurological deterioration, which is not indicated by the scenario provided. Option B (Dual antiplatelet therapy) is appropriate in the acute ischemic stroke setting for secondary prevention in a minor stroke, making it the correct choice. Options C and D are not provided or not indicated.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n\u2022 Dual antiplatelet therapy should be considered in minor ischemic strokes to prevent early recurrence. \u2022 Always assess for signs of cerebellar edema in posterior circulation strokes, which may require urgent neurosurgical intervention. \u2022 Early CT imaging helps differentiate infarction from hemorrhage, guiding management decisions.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies, including the CHANCE and POINT trials, have demonstrated that short-term dual antiplatelet therapy can reduce recurrent stroke risk in patients with minor ischemic stroke. Guidelines continue to support this approach while underscoring the need for individualized care based on infarct size and associated complications.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nCADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary small vessel disease that typically presents with migraine with aura, recurrent strokes, and cognitive decline. The diagnosis relies on recognizing a combination of clinical features, characteristic MRI findings, and confirmatory genetic testing.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nCADASIL results from a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene, which leads to abnormal accumulation of granular osmiophilic material in the vascular smooth muscle cells and subsequent degeneration. This process causes progressive white matter changes and subcortical infarcts over time.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients often present with a triad of migraine (often with aura), recurrent ischemic strokes, and cognitive impairment progressing to dementia. Neuroimaging (MRI) typically shows confluent white matter hyperintensities, particularly in the anterior temporal lobes and external capsules, which is highly suggestive of CADASIL.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe diagnostic workup for suspected CADASIL begins with MRI of the brain to look for characteristic white matter changes. Differential diagnoses include sporadic small vessel ischemic disease, multiple sclerosis, and other leukoencephalopathies, but the distinct anterior temporal and external capsule involvement helps differentiate CADASIL. Definitive diagnosis is made by genetic testing for mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. Historically, skin biopsy to detect granular osmiophilic material was used but has been largely supplanted by molecular diagnostics.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThere is currently no cure for CADASIL; management is largely supportive and focuses on controlling vascular risk factors. Antiplatelet agents (typically low-dose aspirin) may be prescribed for secondary stroke prevention, and migraine management is symptomatic. In pregnancy, risk factor management should be balanced carefully as some medications may not be safe; low-dose aspirin may be continued if indicated. Lactating mothers should be managed similarly with close consultation from specialists, as most treatments are based on symptomatic control and prevention.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nThe correct diagnostic pathway is to perform an MRI brain, which shows characteristic white matter lesions (especially in the anterior temporal lobe and external capsule), followed by genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations to confirm the diagnosis. Option A (assuming it represents this combined approach) is thus correct. Other options, such as CT brain, skin biopsy alone, CSF analysis, or angiography, are either less sensitive or nonspecific and therefore incorrect.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n\u2022 The combination of migraine with aura, recurrent strokes, and cognitive decline in a patient with a family history should prompt consideration of CADASIL. \u2022 MRI findings of anterior temporal lobe and external capsule involvement are highly specific for CADASIL. \u2022 Genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations remains the gold standard for confirmation.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent research emphasizes the sensitivity of MRI in identifying CADASIL and supports the use of NOTCH3 genetic testing as definitive.

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nA floating thrombus, as seen on an MRA (magnetic resonance angiography), is a thrombotic lesion that is not fully adherent to the vessel wall and carries a high risk of embolization. It is typically associated with significant arterial stenosis.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nHigh-grade stenosis can lead to turbulent blood flow, which predisposes the formation of thrombus. A free-floating thrombus is dangerous because parts of it can dislodge and embolize to distal vascular territories, potentially causing transient ischemic attacks or stroke.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients may exhibit transient neurological deficits or signs of an acute ischemic event depending on where embolization occurs. The imaging finding of a floating thrombus is considered an emergency due to the risk of stroke from embolic occlusion of distal vessels.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nNon-invasive imaging such as MRA is often used for vascular evaluation. Differential diagnoses include stable atherosclerotic plaque without thrombus, arterial dissection, or vasculitis. The presence of a mobile component (floating thrombus) differentiates it from a fixed plaque, signaling higher embolic risk.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nImmediate anticoagulation with a heparin infusion is the usual first-line treatment to prevent further embolization and allow stabilization of the thrombus. This is typically followed by further imaging and consideration for definitive procedures (such as carotid endarterectomy or stenting) once the acute phase is managed. In pregnant patients, unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin is preferred because they do not cross the placenta; similar principles apply while lactating, as these agents are safe.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (heparin infusion) is correct because it provides immediate anticoagulation, reducing the risk of thrombus propagation and embolization. Option B (hydrocortisone) is irrelevant for thrombus management. Option C (surgical intervention) may be considered in selected cases and at a later stage once the thrombus is stabilized, and option D (dual or single antiplatelet) does not provide the rapid anticoagulant effect needed in this emergent scenario.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n\u2022 A free-floating thrombus is an emergent finding that requires prompt anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of distal embolization. \u2022 Heparin infusion is the first-line management in such cases before contemplating surgical or endovascular interventions. \u2022 Always assess for contraindications to anticoagulation in the acute phase.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nCurrent literature and guidelines support the initiation of anticoagulation, particularly heparin infusion, as the best initial management for a free-floating carotid thrombus.

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nEmbolic strokes, especially in the elderly, often arise from a cardioembolic source such as atrial fibrillation. Recognizing the stroke mechanism is crucial, as management strategies differ substantially from those for atherothrombotic strokes.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIn embolic strokes, a clot (often formed in the heart due to conditions like atrial fibrillation or from a cardiac thrombus) dislodges and travels to the cerebral circulation, causing sudden arterial occlusion and ischemia. This process typically leads to infarction in a vascular territory distant from the primary lesion.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with cardioembolic strokes usually present with sudden-onset neurological deficits (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia) that can be more severe compared to lacunar strokes. Identifying the embolic source is important, as recurrent embolic events are common without appropriate intervention.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nWorkup includes brain imaging (CT or MRI), cardiac evaluation (ECG, Holter monitoring, echocardiography), and assessment of stroke risk factors. Differential diagnoses include atherothrombotic stroke, lacunar infarcts from small vessel disease, and hemorrhagic stroke. Cardiac investigations help confirm the embolic source.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFor secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke, anticoagulation is the cornerstone of therapy. Options include warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), with DOACs increasingly preferred in non-valvular atrial fibrillation due to better safety profiles. In pregnancy, warfarin is contraindicated and low molecular weight heparin is preferred. For lactating mothers, warfarin is generally considered safe, but each case should be evaluated individually. The decision to start anticoagulation should follow confirmation of the embolic source to reduce recurrent stroke risk.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A is correct because initiating anticoagulation directly addresses the thromboembolic source, significantly reducing the risk of recurrent strokes. Options that suggest antiplatelet therapy alone or no treatment are inadequate in preventing further embolic events, as antiplatelets do not provide sufficient protection in cardioembolic stroke.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n\u2022 Always evaluate for atrial fibrillation in patients with embolic stroke as it is a common and treatable source. \u2022 Anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke recurrence by approximately 60-70% in cardioembolic stroke. \u2022 DOACs have largely supplanted warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation due to their favorable safety profile.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines from the American Heart Association and European Stroke Organization support the use of anticoagulation for secondary prevention in cardioembolic strokes, with a growing body of evidence favoring DOACs over warfarin in appropriate patients.

Its management is predominantly supportive, with emphasis on controlling modifiable vascular risk factors.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nMutations in the NOTCH3 gene impair the function of vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to degeneration and thickening of the vessel wall. This results in chronic ischemia, white matter changes, lacunar infarcts, and ultimately, the clinical manifestations of migraine, strokes, and dementia. There is no disease\u2010modifying therapy currently available.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients typically present with migraine (often with aura), followed by recurrent ischemic strokes and a progressive decline in cognitive function. The history of migraine, stroke, and subsequent vascular dementia in a relatively young patient may suggest CADASIL.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nInitial evaluation includes a detailed clinical history and brain MRI (which typically shows confluent white matter hyperintensities especially in the anterior temporal lobes). Confirmation is achieved via genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations. Differential diagnoses include other causes of vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis, and other hereditary leukoencephalopathies.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThere is no curative treatment for CADASIL. Management is centered on controlling modifiable vascular risk factors. First\u2010line recommendations include lifestyle modifications (most importantly, smoking cessation) and blood pressure control. Antiplatelet agents (such as ASA) are sometimes used for secondary stroke prevention, but the evidence in CADASIL is not robust. Anticoagulation is generally avoided due to a higher risk of hemorrhage. In pregnant or lactating patients, careful risk\u2013benefit evaluation of any pharmacotherapy is mandatory, with an emphasis on non\u2010pharmacological risk factor modification.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (smoking cessation) is correct because eliminating a modifiable risk factor is paramount in slowing the progression of vascular damage in CADASIL. Option B (anticoagulant/warfarin) is contraindicated as it increases hemorrhagic risks in small vessel arteriopathy. Option C (ASA) is not the first choice given the lack of proven benefit in CADASIL prophylaxis and potential bleeding risks, thus making risk factor modification (i.e. smoking cessation) the preferred approach.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. CADASIL is a genetic small vessel disease with no specific disease\u2010modifying treatment \u2013 management relies on controlling risk factors. 2. Smoking cessation is critical as smoking exacerbates vascular injury. 3. MRI with anterior temporal lobe involvement is a key radiologic clue to CADASIL.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent reviews and consensus guidelines emphasize that in genetically mediated small vessel diseases like CADASIL, the most effective strategy is strict risk factor modification rather than relying on antithrombotic therapy.

With CADASIL being a non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic arteriopathy, the management goal is to reduce additional vascular injury.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe underlying NOTCH3 mutation leads to vascular smooth muscle dysfunction which causes progressive damage to the small cerebral vessels. This structural abnormality predisposes patients to ischemic events and white matter lesions.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nDue to the recurring strokes and associated migraine attacks, patients with CADASIL are prone to worsening disability. Prevention of further vascular damage through modification of risk factors is essential since no disease-specific pharmacological treatment exists.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical findings (migraine with aura, subcortical strokes, and early dementia) along with radiologic evidence on MRI and confirmed by genetic testing. Differential diagnoses include sporadic ischemic stroke and other hereditary leukoencephalopathies.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nSince there is no curative treatment, the first-line management involves rigorous modification of vascular risk factors. The cornerstone of treatment is lifestyle modification, with smoking cessation being the most critical. Although antiplatelets like ASA are sometimes used, their role is not clearly established in CADASIL, and anticoagulation is generally contraindicated. Management in pregnancy and lactation similarly emphasizes non-pharmacologic interventions to avoid harm to the fetus or neonate.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (smoking cessation) is the correct answer as it directly addresses modifiable risk factors to slow disease progression. Option A is consistent with the principles of CADASIL management. The marked answer was C, but given the context from the previous similar question, risk factor modification (specifically smoking cessation) remains the best intervention.

A history of a recent stroke is a well-recognized contraindication to thrombolysis.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIV tPA works by dissolving clots; however, in brain tissue that has already sustained recent ischemic injury, the blood\u2013brain barrier is compromised. Administering tPA under these circumstances significantly increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation, where damaged vessels are prone to bleeding.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn the case presented, an 80-year-old man with a stroke history 2 months prior is now having a new stroke within the therapeutic window. Despite a CT scan showing no acute hemorrhage and evidence of an old cortical insult, the recent stroke is a major red flag, making reperfusion therapy (tPA or tPA plus thrombectomy) a dangerous option.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nEvaluation includes confirming the stroke timing, reviewing the patient\u2019s history for contraindications (like stroke within the past 3 months), and neuroimaging (CT, MRI) to assess for hemorrhage or infarct evolution. Differential diagnoses such as transient ischemic attack (TIA) and hemorrhagic stroke must be considered and appropriately excluded.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFirst-line treatment for eligible acute ischemic stroke patients is IV tPA administered within the appropriate window, potentially followed by thrombectomy if large vessel occlusion is identified. However, in patients with a recent stroke (within the last 3 months), reperfusion therapies are contraindicated due to the heightened risk of bleeding. In such situations, management shifts to supportive care and secondary prevention strategies. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of tPA involves careful consideration of maternal and fetal risks, with current guidelines generally advising against thrombolysis if contraindications are present.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (IV tPA) and Option B (IV tPA followed by thrombectomy) are incorrect because recent stroke (< 3 months) is a contraindication to tPA administration. The marked answer, Option C, though not textually described, is interpreted to mean that thrombolytic therapy should be withheld in this situation, making it the correct choice.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. A stroke within the past 3 months is a contraindication to tPA due to increased hemorrhagic risk. 2. Always review the patient's recent medical history before considering reperfusion therapies. 3. Advanced age alone is not a contraindication, but accompanying recent stroke is critical.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines and updated stroke management protocols underscore that a recent stroke (typically within 3 months) is a contraindication for IV tPA due to the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Ongoing studies and clinical audits consistently support excluding patients with recent strokes from reperfusion therapies, even if they present within the otherwise acceptable time window.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThrombolytic therapy with tPA is indicated in acute ischemic stroke provided that patients meet strict eligibility criteria. One key contraindication is a recent ischemic event, as the risk of hemorrhagic conversion is significantly increased in recently infarcted brain tissue.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAfter an ischemic stroke, the blood\u2013brain barrier is disrupted. Administering tPA in this vulnerable period (usually within 3 months of a previous stroke) can precipitate bleeding into the damaged brain tissue, leading to hemorrhagic transformation and worse clinical outcomes.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn the scenario, the patient had a stroke just 2 months ago and is now presenting with a new ischemic event. This recent history significantly raises the risk of hemorrhagic complications if tPA is administered. Recognizing and adhering to this contraindication is crucial for patient safety.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nA thorough history is vital to determine the timing of previous strokes. Neuroimaging (CT/MRI) is used to rule out current hemorrhage and to assess brain tissue status. The differential diagnosis may include a new ischemic event versus a hemorrhagic transformation of the previous stroke, making accurate history-taking essential.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe standard management principles dictate that in patients with a stroke within the past 3 months, tPA should be withheld. Management then focuses on secondary prevention of stroke, optimization of vascular risk factors, and supportive care. In pregnant or lactating patients, the risk\u2013benefit analysis is even more complex, and conservative management is favored in the presence of contraindications.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A states that a stroke less than 3 months ago is a (relative) contraindication for tPA, which is correct. Option B is vague with reference to exclusion criteria, and Option C (suggesting thrombectomy benefit) is misleading because the contraindication applies primarily to tPA usage. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Always confirm the time interval since the last stroke; a stroke within 3 months significantly increases tPA-associated hemorrhagic risk. 2. A thorough medical history is paramount in acute stroke management. 3. Thrombolytic therapy contraindications are strictly adhered to in order to minimize risks.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nThe most recent stroke management guidelines (including those from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association) explicitly list recent stroke (within 3 months) as a contraindication for IV tPA. Recent literature continues to validate this exclusion due to the elevated risk of bleeding, and research is ongoing to better stratify risk in these patients.",
