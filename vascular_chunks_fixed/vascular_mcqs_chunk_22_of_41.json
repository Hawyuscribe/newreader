    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nCerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a type of stroke resulting from thrombosis in the dural venous sinuses. In young women, the use of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP) is a well\u2010recognized, reversible risk factor.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nExogenous estrogen from COCPs can increase the production of coagulation factors and reduce anticoagulant proteins, tipping the hemostatic balance toward thrombosis. When thrombosis occurs in the superior sagittal sinus, it results in impaired venous drainage and increased intracranial pressure.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nCVST commonly presents in young women with headache, seizures, and possibly focal neurological deficits. In this case, a 22\u2010year\u2010old female on COCPs with headache and imaging evidence of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis demonstrates a classic clinical scenario.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe diagnosis is confirmed through imaging studies such as CT venography (CTV) or MR venography (MRV). Differential diagnoses include migraine, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and other causes of headache. A thorough history often reveals a provoking factor like COCP use.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe mainstay of treatment for CVST is anticoagulation (typically with low-molecular-weight heparin initially, followed by oral anticoagulants). It is advisable to defer extensive thrombophilia testing during the acute phase because acute phase reactants and anticoagulation can alter results. In pregnant or lactating women, low-molecular-weight heparin is favored due to its safety profile.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A states that because there is a clear provoking factor (COCP use), no further workup is immediately necessary, which is in line with many guidelines. Option B (perform a thrombophilia workup) might be considered in cases with no clear cause or a family history of thrombosis, but in this scenario, the COCP is a sufficient explanation. Testing for thrombophilia is usually deferred until after the acute phase (often several months later) to avoid confounding results.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. In a young female with CVST and COCP use, the contraceptive is typically the provocative risk factor, and routine thrombophilia screening can usually be deferred. 2. Repeat thrombophilia testing may be performed after the acute phase has resolved, as initial tests can be inaccurate due to the acute event and anticoagulant effects. 3. Anticoagulation remains the cornerstone of CVST management despite any hemorrhagic transformation on imaging.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nCurrent guidelines, including those from the American Heart Association, suggest that in the setting of a clear provoking factor, extensive thrombophilia evaluation is not mandatory during the acute phase of CVST. This approach helps avoid unnecessary interventions and misinterpretation of results.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nIn women on oral contraceptives presenting with headache and seizures, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a prime consideration\u2014even when the initial non-contrast CT scan is normal. CVST often requires advanced imaging for diagnosis.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nCVST results from clot formation in the cerebral venous sinuses, leading to impaired venous drainage, increased intracranial pressure, and potential venous infarctions or hemorrhages. OCP use is a risk factor because it creates a hypercoagulable state that predisposes to thrombosis.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nClinically, patients may present with headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, or papilledema. A normal CT scan does not exclude CVST; therefore, further imaging with dedicated venographic techniques is warranted.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nWhen suspicion for CVST remains high despite a normal CT, CT venography (CTV) or MR venography (MRV) should be performed to visualize the venous system and detect the presence of thrombi. Differential diagnoses in such cases include primary seizure disorders and meningitis, but the OCP history directs attention toward thrombotic causes.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nOnce CVST is diagnosed, the first-line treatment is anticoagulation (typically with low-molecular-weight heparin followed by warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant). In cases where the patient is pregnant or lactating, LMWH is the preferred treatment due to its established safety profile in these populations.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (LP) is not indicated in this scenario because lumbar puncture would not visualize venous clot and may risk herniation if intracranial pressure is high. Option B (EEG) is used to evaluate seizure activity but does not address the underlying etiology. Option C (CTV) is the correct next step to evaluate for CVST. The absence of a fourth option confirms that CTV is the most sensitive and specific noninvasive test in this context.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. A normal non-contrast CT does not rule out CVST; always consider venography in high-risk patients. 2. In patients on OCPs with new-onset headache and seizures, CVST is a critical diagnosis to exclude. 3. Early diagnosis and management of CVST with appropriate imaging can substantially improve outcomes.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines emphasize the use of CT venography as a critical tool in the evaluation of suspected CVST, given its high sensitivity and rapid availability. Studies continue to support early anticoagulation as the cornerstone of treatment even if initial CT imaging appears normal.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nLacunar strokes are small subcortical infarctions typically caused by occlusion of small perforating arteries. One well\u2010recognized lacunar syndrome is the pure sensory stroke, which is usually due to an infarct in the ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nChronic hypertension and diabetes can lead to lipohyalinosis of small penetrating arteries. When one of these vessels supplying the thalamus becomes occluded, it disrupts the sensory pathways without affecting motor fibers. This results in an infarct that produces isolated sensory deficits in the contralateral hemibody.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with a pure sensory stroke typically present with sudden onset contralateral numbness or loss of sensory modalities (pain, temperature, proprioception) without motor weakness. An MRI demonstrating a small lacunar infarct in the thalamus correlates with these clinical findings.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (especially DWI) is highly sensitive for detecting lacunar infarcts. Differential diagnoses include: (a) infarcts in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (which cause pure motor deficits), (b) sensorimotor strokes (when both motor and sensory functions are affected) and (c) demyelinating diseases. Detailed clinical history and risk factor assessment help differentiate these entities.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAcute management includes antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin), aggressive blood pressure and risk factor control, and secondary prevention strategies. In pregnant or lactating patients with stroke, low-dose aspirin is generally considered safe with careful monitoring, and risk factor modification is essential.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Pure motor) is seen with lacunar infarcts in areas like the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Option B (Pure sensory) is correct because a thalamic lacunar infarct typically leads to isolated sensory deficits. Option C (Mixed) would be expected with sensorimotor strokes where both motor and sensory areas are involved. Option D (Clumsy) hints at ataxic hemiparesis, which involves a combination of motor weakness and clumsiness \u2013 not isolated sensory loss.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. A pure sensory stroke is most commonly due to a lacunar infarct in the thalamic VPL nucleus. 2. Appropriate blood pressure control is crucial in preventing subsequent small vessel damage.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines emphasize the importance of managing vascular risk factors to prevent lacunar strokes. High-resolution MRI and DWI are the imaging modalities of choice for early detection, and evidence supports the use of antiplatelet agents as part of secondary prevention.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nAcute ischemic stroke management follows a time\u2010sensitive approach with reperfusion therapy (IV tPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy) being standard treatments. However, proper patient selection \u2013 including blood pressure control \u2013 is critical to avoid complications.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nExtremely elevated blood pressure in the acute stroke setting increases the risk of hemorrhagic conversion, especially if thrombolytic therapy is administered while BP exceeds recommended thresholds. The concern is that high intravascular pressures can disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier integrity during reperfusion.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn this elderly patient with a high NIHSS score (indicative of a significant ischemic stroke) and severely elevated blood pressure (220/110 mm Hg), immediate control of BP is mandatory before any reperfusion therapy can be initiated. Elevated BP is both a physiological response to stroke and a modifiable risk factor.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nAfter non-contrast CT rules out hemorrhage, further vascular imaging like CTA is often used to identify large vessel occlusions. Differential considerations include hypertensive encephalopathy and other causes of intracranial hemorrhage; however, the clinical picture along with CT findings supports ischemic stroke. Blood pressure must be addressed promptly to meet criteria for IV thrombolysis.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe first step is to lower the BP to at most 185/110 mm Hg using fast-acting intravenous agents (such as labetalol or nicardipine), as per American Heart Association guidelines. Once BP is controlled, IV thrombolysis (if criteria are met) or mechanical thrombectomy (if a large vessel occlusion is present) can be considered. In pregnancy or lactation, choice of antihypertensive agents requires careful consideration; labetalol is often preferred due to its relatively safe profile in these settings.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Give tPA) is contraindicated until BP is lowered below the recommended threshold. Option B (BP management) is correct as immediate blood pressure reduction is essential before reperfusion therapies are safe. Option C (CTA) is important in the evaluation process, but with BP at 220/110 mm Hg, the priority is to manage BP first. Option D (Mechanical Thrombectomy) might be considered later, but only after BP is adequately controlled and vascular imaging confirms eligibility.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. For IV tPA eligibility, blood pressure must be below 185/110 mm Hg. 2. Rapid control of hypertension in acute stroke is crucial to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic transformation.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nUpdated stroke guidelines reinforce that severe hypertension is a contraindication for immediate thrombolysis until it is brought under control. Recent studies support the use of intravenous antihypertensives to safely lower BP in eligible patients.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nManagement of intracranial atherosclerotic disease, especially when it is symptomatic, centers on aggressive medical therapy. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has been shown to reduce the risk of early recurrent stroke in patients with high-grade stenosis.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIntracranial stenosis is primarily due to atherosclerotic plaque buildup, leading to luminal narrowing and an increased risk for thromboembolism. In the setting of a small infarct (here described as a lacunar infarct) with severe MCA stenosis, the culprit lesion is likely due to branch occlusion from atherosclerotic disease.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nThe patient with left-sided weakness and MRI findings of a right lacunar infarct, in conjunction with CTA showing severe right MCA stenosis, is at high risk for further ischemic events. This scenario requires medical management rather than procedural intervention in the acute phase.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is achieved through MRI (confirming infarction) and CTA (demonstrating vascular stenosis). Differential diagnoses include cardioembolic stroke, other large vessel atherosclerotic strokes, or small vessel lipohyalinosis without significant stenosis. The comparative evaluation of imaging findings differentiates intracranial atherosclerotic disease from pure lacunar disease.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nBased on current guidelines and the SAMMPRIS trial, first-line management for symptomatic intracranial stenosis is aggressive medical therapy with dual antiplatelet treatment (typically aspirin plus clopidogrel) for a defined period along with intensive risk factor management (e.g., blood pressure, lipids, diabetes control). Stenting is generally reserved for cases refractory to medical therapy. In pregnant or lactating patients, antiplatelet choices may be modified; low-dose aspirin is acceptable, although clopidogrel use requires careful risk-benefit evaluation.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (ASA alone) may be insufficient to prevent recurrence in this high-risk scenario. Option B (IV thrombolysis) applies to acute ischemic stroke intervention but does not address the underlying intracranial stenosis once the acute event has passed. Option C (DAPT) is correct, as it aligns with current recommendations for managing symptomatic intracranial stenosis. Option D (Stent) is not the first-line treatment given that studies such as SAMMPRIS have shown that intensive medical management is superior to stenting in the initial management phase.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. In symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis, DAPT plays a crucial role in preventing early recurrent strokes. 2. Stenting is typically reserved for patients who have failed optimal medical management.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent landmark trials, including SAMMPRIS, strongly support an initial management strategy of dual antiplatelet therapy combined with risk factor modification in cases of symptomatic intracranial stenosis.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nPosterior circulation strokes, particularly those affecting the brainstem, can produce a variety of cranial nerve deficits. Involvement of structures governing the soft palate, such as the nucleus ambiguus, leads to characteristic findings like uvular deviation.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nInfarction within the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome) often affects the nucleus ambiguus or its associated fibers, which are responsible for the motor innervation of the palate via the vagus nerve (CN X). When these fibers are compromised on one side, the functioning opposite side exerts a greater pull on the soft palate, causing the uvula to deviate away from the side of the lesion.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nA patient presenting with vertigo and nausea is often experiencing a posterior circulation event. If the infarct involves the right lateral medulla, one might expect a right-sided weakness of the palatal muscles, resulting in uvular deviation toward the left. Other associated symptoms can include dysphagia, hoarseness, and ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is sensitive for detecting acute infarcts in the brainstem. Differential diagnoses include cerebellar infarcts, vestibular neuritis, and other brainstem syndromes. A careful neurological exam helps to distinguish the patterns; for example, uvular deviation typically indicates involvement of the vagal motor fibers.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAcute management focuses on supportive treatment, secondary prevention with antithrombotic therapy, and aggressive risk factor modification. In pregnant or lactating patients, management follows similar principles, but medication choices (including antiplatelets) must consider fetal and neonatal safety. Rehabilitation for swallowing and speech may also be required.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Right side ptosis) may be a feature of Horner\u2019s syndrome seen in lateral medullary infarcts, but it is not the specific sign tested here. Option B (Left uvula deviation) is correct for a right-sided lesion affecting the nucleus ambiguus, as the palate deviates away from the affected side. Option C (Right uvula deviation) would imply a left-sided lesion. Option D is not provided.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. In lesions affecting the nucleus ambiguus, the uvula deviates away from the side of the lesion. 2. Vertigo and nausea in a stroke patient should prompt evaluation of the posterior circulation and brainstem structures.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies and guidelines continue to emphasize the importance of early recognition of posterior circulation strokes. Advanced imaging techniques have enhanced the diagnostic accuracy for brainstem infarcts, and multidisciplinary management remains the standard of care.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nWatershed infarcts are a type of ischemic stroke that occur in the border zones between two major cerebral arterial territories (eg, between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries or between the middle and posterior cerebral arteries). They typically result from systemic hypoperfusion or severe carotid disease, leading to reduced blood flow in these vulnerable border regions.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIn watershed strokes, the distal fields of two arterial systems are most vulnerable to a drop in cerebral perfusion pressure. In elderly patients, chronic vascular disease or severe hypotension (or carotid occlusive disease) can lead to these borderzone infarcts. The compromised perfusion in these regions causes ischemia and infarction. Recent evidence underscores the importance of maintaining optimal hemodynamic stability, especially in patients with preexisting carotid disease.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with watershed infarcts may present with symptoms that correlate with the affected borderzone regions. For example, infarcts between the ACA and MCA territories can produce contralateral leg weakness and cognitive disturbances. In an elderly male with a history of vascular disease, an MRI showing a border-zone pattern supports a diagnosis of a watershed infarct.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis usually relies on neuroimaging (MRI is more sensitive than CT in the early phase). Differential diagnoses include: cardioembolic stroke (typically producing cortical infarcts in distinct vascular territories), small vessel (lacunar) infarcts which affect deep structures, and vasculitis which often produces multifocal, scattered lesions. History, risk factor assessment, and imaging characteristics help differentiate these conditions.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement focuses on correcting the underlying hemodynamic instability. First-line management involves optimizing blood flow, blood pressure control, and supportive care. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, and management of risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, etc.). In special populations such as pregnant or lactating women, careful selection of antihypertensives (eg, labetalol or nifedipine) and antiplatelet agents with safety profiles in pregnancy is essential.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Watershed) is correct as the imaging is consistent with a border-zone pattern. Option B (Cardioembolic) is typically associated with abrupt cortical infarcts in distinct vascular distributions. Option C (Small Vessel Disease) usually gives lacunar infarcts in deep brain regions. Option D (Vasculitis) generally exhibits multifocal and irregular lesions rather than the classic border-zone pattern.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Watershed infarcts occur in areas where arterial territories meet (border zones) and are highly sensitive to drops in perfusion pressure. 2. Management requires strict control of blood pressure and risk factor modification. 3. Neuroimaging is crucial to differentiate watershed infarcts from other types of stroke.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies emphasize the importance of perioperative and long\u2010term blood pressure management to prevent watershed infarctions in at-risk populations.

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nHyperperfusion syndrome is a recognized complication following procedures that restore blood flow, such as carotid revascularization. It results from an abrupt increase in cerebral blood flow to previously hypoperfused brain regions that have lost the ability to autoregulate.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIn chronic stenotic conditions, cerebral blood vessels adapt to low flow, leading to impaired autoregulation. When revascularization (eg, carotid endarterectomy or stenting) suddenly increases the blood supply, the cerebral arterioles cannot constrict adequately. This results in increased capillary pressure, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, vasogenic edema, and sometimes even intracerebral hemorrhage. The mechanism is well-documented in cases following revascularization procedures.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients typically present within hours to a few days after revascularization with symptoms such as headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures or focal deficits. In this case, confusion occurring one day post-procedure is highly suggestive of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nClinical diagnosis is supported by imaging (CT or MRI), which may show cerebral edema or hemorrhage. Differential diagnoses include hypoperfusion infarcts (which would present with focal deficits and ischemic changes on imaging), embolic strokes (which often show territorial infarcts), and reperfusion injury. The time course and imaging findings help differentiate hyperperfusion syndrome from these conditions.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe cornerstone of management is strict blood pressure control to prevent further increases in cerebral perfusion pressure. First-line treatment involves intravenous antihypertensives such as labetalol or nicardipine. Supportive care and close neurological monitoring are essential. In severe cases with cerebral edema, additional measures like osmotherapy may be required. In pregnant patients, labetalol and hydralazine are considered safe; similar caution applies during lactation with appropriate agent selection.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Hypoperfusion) is incorrect as it would result in ischemic infarction rather than the edema seen in hyperperfusion syndrome. Option B (Hyperperfusion) is correct, as it best explains the sudden increase in blood flow following revascularization leading to edema and neurologic symptoms. Option C (Autoregulation) is a normal physiological process that is impaired in this scenario, and Option D (Artery to artery embolism) would typically result in territorial infarcts rather than the diffuse changes seen here.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Hyperperfusion syndrome typically manifests within 24-72 hours after carotid revascularization. 2. The key management step is aggressive blood pressure control to mitigate the risk of hemorrhage. 3. Recognition of the syndrome is critical to prevent further neurological deterioration.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nCurrent guidelines stress the importance of perioperative monitoring of blood pressure following revascularization procedures.

This enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, particularly globotriaosylceramide, in various tissues throughout the body.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A results in the deposition of glycosphingolipids in the endothelial cells of blood vessels, the nervous system, kidneys, and skin. This accumulation can lead to vascular dysfunction, pain in the extremities (acroparesthesias), and organ damage. The stroke, neuropathy, and characteristic skin findings (angiokeratomas) seen in Fabry disease correlate with the widespread vascular deposition and subsequent tissue ischemia and inflammation.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with Fabry disease often present with a combination of clinical features such as early-onset strokes, peripheral neuropathy (manifesting as burning pain in the hands and feet), and angiokeratomas (small, reddish-purple skin lesions). These signs are crucial for the clinical diagnosis of the disorder.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed by measuring alpha-galactosidase A activity in leukocytes or plasma, with genetic testing to identify mutations in the GLA gene. Differential diagnoses include other lysosomal storage disorders (such as Gaucher's disease) and conditions causing stroke in young adults. The pattern of multisystem involvement with characteristic skin lesions and neuropathic pain assists in differentiating Fabry disease from other disorders.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement includes enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agents such as agalsidase beta or agalsidase alfa to reduce glycosphingolipid accumulation.

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nSturge-Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by a facial capillary malformation (commonly known as a port-wine stain) along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, leptomeningeal angiomas, and associated ocular abnormalities.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe syndrome is thought to arise from a somatic mosaic mutation in the GNAQ gene, leading to abnormal vascular development. The port-wine stain is due to capillary malformations in the skin, and the leptomeningeal angiomas can lead to seizures and neurological deficits. The ocular involvement, particularly glaucoma, is due to increased episcleral venous pressure and abnormal vascular development in the eye.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with Sturge-Weber syndrome typically present with a port-wine stain (often described as a 'port wine' or 'bordeaux wine' appearance) on the face, usually in the V1 distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Glaucoma is a common complication and can lead to vision loss if not managed appropriately. Neurological symptoms such as seizures may also be present due to leptomeningeal angiomatosis.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is primarily clinical based on the characteristic cutaneous and neurological findings. Neuroimaging (MRI/CT) can help identify leptomeningeal angiomas, and ophthalmologic evaluation is essential for early detection of glaucoma. Differential diagnoses include other phakomatoses like Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, but the combination of facial port-wine stain and leptomeningeal involvement is specific for Sturge-Weber.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement is multidisciplinary. Seizures are managed with antiepileptic medications with careful consideration in pregnant and lactating patients (eg, lamotrigine or levetiracetam, which have relatively favorable profiles). Glaucoma management is crucial and may include topical medications like beta-blockers (with caution in pregnancy, where agents like timolol require careful risk assessment) or surgical interventions if medical therapy fails. Regular ophthalmologic and neurological monitoring is advised.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Renal Angiofibroma) is incorrect as it is not a feature of Sturge-Weber syndrome. Option B (Cardiac Rhabdomyosarcoma) is unrelated to the syndrome. Option C (Glaucoma) is correct because glaucoma is a well-known ocular complication associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. The port-wine stain in Sturge-Weber syndrome is typically unilateral and follows the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. 2. Glaucoma is a common complication and can develop in early childhood or later in life. 3. Early and regular ophthalmologic evaluations are critical to prevent vision loss.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent research and clinical guidelines emphasize early recognition and intervention for glaucoma in Sturge-Weber patients. Advances in neuroimaging and genetic testing have improved the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, aiding in more tailored management approaches.",
