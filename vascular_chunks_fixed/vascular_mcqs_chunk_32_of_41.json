    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nAnterior choroidal artery infarction is a specific type of ischemic stroke involving the small artery that supplies portions of the internal capsule, optic tract, lateral geniculate body, and other deep brain structures. Clinically, it is characterized by a triad including contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and a visual field defect (often a homonymous hemianopia), making the diagnosis suggestion clear when these features are present.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nOcclusion of the anterior choroidal artery leads to ischemic damage in its vascular territory. The infarct typically affects the posterior limb of the internal capsule (resulting in motor and sensory deficits) and the optic radiations/tract (leading to visual field deficits). This infarction is often thromboembolic in nature, related either to atherosclerotic disease or cardioembolic events.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with anterior choroidal artery stroke often present acutely with neurological deficits that include weakness and numbness on the contralateral side as well as a visual field defect corresponding to the loss of visual information processing in the affected optical pathway. The presence of visual field findings in tandem with motor/sensory deficits strongly supports the diagnosis.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is based on a combined assessment of clinical presentation and neuroimaging (CT, MRI, and angiography). Differential diagnoses include other vascular territories such as middle cerebral artery or posterior cerebral artery infarctions, as well as lacunar strokes; however, the classic combination seen in anterior choroidal strokes helps in distinguishing it. A focused neurological exam assessing motor strength, sensory function, and visual fields is critical in directing imaging studies for confirmation.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAcute management involves assessing eligibility for reperfusion therapies such as intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment if within the therapeutic window. Subsequent management includes antiplatelet therapy and secondary prevention strategies (including risk factor management such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia control). For pregnant or lactating patients, treatment choices require special considerations: low-dose aspirin is generally acceptable during pregnancy, and thrombolytic therapy may be considered when potential benefits outweigh risks after consultation with multidisciplinary teams. Individualized risk\u2013benefit analysis is crucial in these populations.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nIn the presented MCQ, Option A ('anterior choroidal artery infarction') is the appropriate answer because the clinical scenario, which includes a visual field defect along with associated neurological deficits, matches the typical presentation of an infarction in the anterior choroidal artery territory. Although the other options are not listed, the information given solidly supports Option A.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\nRecognize the classic triad of deficits (motor, sensory, and visual) in anterior choroidal strokes. Immediate neuroimaging is essential to confirm the diagnosis, and early reperfusion can significantly improve outcomes. In special populations such as pregnant or lactating patients, adapt standard stroke management protocols with extra care regarding medication safety.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent guidelines and studies continue to support the early use of reperfusion therapy in acute ischemic stroke, including those with anterior choroidal involvement. Updated protocols emphasize rapid diagnosis and tailored management, especially for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, where low-dose aspirin and careful consideration of thrombolytic therapy are supported by current evidence.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThis case describes an acute ischemic stroke evidenced by a new left occipital lesion on CT scan, with a presentation that is sudden and within the thrombolytic time window (approximately 1 hour). The rationale for administering IV tPA is based on the principle that early reperfusion therapy can salvage ischemic but still viable brain tissue, thereby improving outcomes.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAcute ischemic stroke is caused by occlusion of a cerebral artery\u2014in this scenario, likely a branch supplying the occipital lobe. This occlusion leads to a cessation of blood flow, resulting in energy failure, neuronal injury, and infarction in the affected area. tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) works by enzymatically breaking down the fibrin clot, restoring perfusion to the penumbral area surrounding the infarct core.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nVisual hallucinations (e.g., seeing animals) can occur with occipital lobe involvement. The subsequent loss of consciousness could be related to the evolution of the stroke or secondary complications. Since the patient is intubated, airway protection has been addressed, enabling the safe administration of thrombolytic therapy.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nInitial evaluation with a non-contrast CT scan is critical to exclude hemorrhage in patients suspected of having a stroke. Once an acute ischemic stroke is confirmed and no contraindications are present, especially within the therapeutic window, IV tPA is indicated. Advanced imaging such as CTA is reserved for cases where vascular occlusion details are required, often in the context of considering mechanical thrombectomy.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAccording to current guidelines (AHA/ASA), IV tPA is recommended for patients with acute ischemic stroke who present within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset, provided there are no contraindications. Since the patient presented within 1 hour and imaging confirmed an ischemic stroke with no evidence of hemorrhage, IV tPA is indicated. In pregnant or lactating patients, tPA is not contraindicated when the benefits outweigh the potential risks; multidisciplinary consultation is advised to guide therapy.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (CTA) is used for vascular imaging but is not mandatory when the diagnosis of ischemia is already established and the patient is within the therapeutic window. Option B (EEG) would only be relevant if a seizure were the primary concern. Option C (TPA) is the appropriate intervention given the acute ischemic findings within the necessary time frame. Option D is absent and does not contribute to management decision-making in this scenario.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n\u2022 Rapid assessment and imaging are crucial in stroke management \u2013 'time is brain.'\n\u2022 A non-contrast CT scan is the first-line investigation to rule out hemorrhage before thrombolysis.\n\u2022 IV tPA should be administered as soon as possible in eligible patients to optimize neurological outcomes.\n\u2022 In special populations such as pregnant or lactating patients, tPA can be considered after balancing potential risks and benefits.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent clinical trials and guidelines from the AHA/ASA have reinforced that the benefits of timely IV tPA in acute ischemic stroke extend even more when administered early. Consensus supports its use in patients with confirmed ischemic stroke within the therapeutic window. Although data on tPA use in pregnancy is limited, case reports and expert recommendations suggest that it can be safely administered when clearly indicated, with appropriate monitoring and multidisciplinary management.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nStroke management is highly time\u2010sensitive. For acute ischemic stroke, the decision to administer treatments like tPA depends on the time since onset, with a narrow window (typically within 3-4.5 hours). In patients presenting outside this window, as in this case (last seen normal one day ago), the best management is supportive care in a stroke unit.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAcute ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion leading to brain tissue ischemia and infarction. The cascade of excitotoxicity, inflammation, and eventual cell death occurs over hours. When the patient is found with decreased consciousness long after the onset, the infarct may be well established and not amenable to reperfusion therapies.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nA 56-year-old with decreased level of consciousness and a delayed presentation is unlikely to benefit from thrombolytics since the window for maximum efficacy has closed. Admission to a stroke unit allows for monitoring of complications such as edema, hemorrhagic transformation, and management of secondary stroke prevention.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nImaging studies (typically a non-contrast CT scan) are used to differentiate hemorrhagic from ischemic stroke. Differential diagnoses include intracerebral hemorrhage, stroke mimics (e.g., seizure postictal state, hypoglycemia), and other causes of altered mental status. The timing (last known well time) is crucial in guiding the therapeutic approach.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nSince the patient is outside the thrombolytic window, first-line management involves supportive care: admission to a specialized stroke unit where multidisciplinary care improves outcomes. Secondary prevention with antiplatelet agents, statins, and risk factor modification is initiated. In pregnancy and lactation, while tPA may be used in selected cases within the window, in patients beyond the window, supportive care in a stroke unit remains standard and is safe.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (tPA) is incorrect because the therapeutic window has elapsed. Option B (admission to a stroke unit) is the correct answer as it aligns with current guidelines in managing patients with established stroke outside the tPA window. Options C and D are not provided or applicable.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Always ascertain the 'last known well' time to determine eligibility for thrombolysis. 2. Stroke units have been shown to significantly improve functional outcomes in stroke patients.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent AHA/ASA guidelines reinforce the importance of dedicated stroke unit care for all patients with acute ischemic stroke, particularly when reperfusion therapy is not an option. Studies continue to validate improved outcomes with organized multidisciplinary care.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nReversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by sudden, severe ('thunderclap') headaches and reversible narrowing of cerebral arteries. The syndrome is often triggered by vasoactive substances or physical stressors.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nRCVS involves transient dysregulation of cerebral arterial tone, leading to multifocal, segmental vasoconstriction. The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but sympathetic overactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and hormonal influences (especially postpartum) are implicated.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with RCVS typically present with thunderclap headaches, which can recur over days to weeks. Neurological deficits may occur if the vasoconstriction leads to ischemia. Unlike other vasculopathies, RCVS is self-limited and reversible over time.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is primarily radiological. CTA, MRA, or digital subtraction angiography may reveal a 'string-of-beads' appearance of alternating constricted and dilated segments. Differential diagnoses include primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), subarachnoid hemorrhage, and migraine variants; PACNS tends to have a more insidious onset and is not self-limited.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nFirst-line management includes supportive care and calcium channel blockers (e.g., nimodipine) to alleviate vasospasm. Avoiding triggers and symptomatic management are important. In pregnancy and lactation, management is similar; calcium channel blockers can be used with careful monitoring, and supportive measures remain the mainstay.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nAlthough the provided options are incomplete, Option A (Low glucose) is not a recognized feature of RCVS. Marked Answer B is presumed to describe the classic angiographic finding (multifocal segmental vasoconstriction or 'string-of-beads' appearance), which is correct. Other unlisted options likely do not match the hallmark features of RCVS.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. RCVS is a reversible condition and often self-limited over weeks. 2. Thunderclap headache is the hallmark, and angiographic studies reveal multi-segmental vasoconstriction.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent studies underscore the utility of calcium channel blockers in RCVS management and stress the importance of differentiating RCVS from conditions like PACNS. Guidelines advocate for a conservative, supportive approach as the vasoconstriction is typically transient.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThe Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA) supplies parts of the lateral midbrain and cerebellum. Lesions in this territory can affect adjacent neural structures, including the descending sympathetic fibers responsible for ocular sympathetic innervation.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAn infarct in the SCA territory may extend into the lateral midbrain where sympathetic fibers run. Interruption of these fibers can produce ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, characterized by ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with SCA strokes may present with a constellation of symptoms including ataxia, vertigo, and sometimes cranial nerve deficits. The presence of ipsilateral Horner's syndrome is an important clue localizing the lesion to regions where the sympathetic pathway is affected.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is achieved via neuroimaging (CT or MRI) showing infarction in the SCA territory. Differential diagnoses include lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome and other brainstem strokes. The demonstration of ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, without involvement of the trochlear nerve (as seen in 4th nerve palsy), helps solidify the diagnosis.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement follows standard ischemic stroke protocols. First-line treatment includes supportive care in a stroke unit, antiplatelet therapy, and risk factor modification. In selected cases within the appropriate time window, reperfusion therapy may be considered. In pregnancy and lactation, treatment modalities including antiplatelet therapy are used with appropriate risk-benefit discussions. Secondary prevention is emphasized.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome) is correct as it reflects the involvement of the descending sympathetic fibers in the lateral midbrain due to SCA infarct. Option B (4th cranial nerve palsy) is incorrect as the trochlear nerve is usually spared in SCA territory strokes, making it an uncommon presentation.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome is a key localizing sign in lateral midbrain and SCA infarcts. 2. Careful neurological examination can differentiate between various brainstem syndromes based on specific deficits.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent research emphasizes the importance of recognizing subtle signs such as Horner's syndrome in posterior circulation strokes.

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nBroca's aphasia is characterized by non-fluent, effortful speech with impaired repetition and naming but relatively preserved comprehension. The lesions are typically localized to the left inferior frontal gyrus in the dominant hemisphere, an area within the frontal perisylvian region.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nAn ischemic stroke affecting Broca\u2019s area results in disruption of the neural circuits involved in speech production. Despite the damage, receptive language areas (such as Wernicke's area) remain intact, preserving comprehension.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients present with right-sided weakness (often due to proximity of motor fibers in the dominant hemisphere) and expressive language deficits. The specific pattern of impaired fluency, repetition, and naming in the setting of intact comprehension makes the diagnosis of Broca's aphasia clear.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nClinical bedside language assessments coupled with neuroimaging (MRI/CT) help confirm the localization. Differential diagnoses include conduction aphasia (characterized by impaired repetition but with relatively fluent speech) and global aphasia (which has both expressive and receptive deficits).\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nAcute management involves standard stroke care with possible reperfusion therapy if within the time window. Long-term management centers on early speech and language therapy. For pregnant or lactating patients, standard stroke management and rehabilitation measures are used, with particular care to avoid teratogenic medications.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Supramarginal Gyrus) is typically associated with conduction aphasia and is less likely to cause the non-fluent speech seen in Broca\u2019s aphasia.

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nThe visual cortex in the occipital lobe receives its blood supply primarily from the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). In patients presenting with visual field defects\u2014such as contralateral homonymous hemianopia with potential macular sparing\u2014the involvement of the PCA is highly suspect. Although the options list includes arteries like the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) and the basilar artery, the artery directly linked to primary visual processing is the PCA.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nOcclusion of the PCA, whether due to embolism, thrombosis, or other cerebrovascular events, leads to ischemia in the occipital cortex. This ischemia disrupts the function of the primary visual cortex, resulting in characteristic visual deficits. Recent evidence emphasizes that timely identification and reperfusion (when indicated) can limit the extent of neural damage.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nClinically, a stroke in the PCA territory typically presents with contralateral visual field deficits (e.g., homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing). Patients may or may not have additional symptoms depending on the involvement of adjacent structures, but the hallmark is the visual defect.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nImaging studies such as CT scans (initially) followed by MRI (to better delineate the affected area) are crucial. CT angiography or MR angiography can help identify an occlusion in the PCA. Differential diagnoses include occipital lobe lesions from other causes (hemorrhage, tumor) but the vascular pattern in stroke remains distinct.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe management of an acute PCA stroke involves rapid evaluation for thrombolytic therapy (if within the therapeutic window), supportive care, and secondary prevention with antiplatelets and control of risk factors. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of thrombolytics is carefully considered following current guidelines, weighing maternal benefit against potential fetal risk. Blood pressure and glucose control, as well as early rehabilitation, form integral parts of management.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (SCA) primarily supplies portions of the cerebellum and midbrain; Option B (Basilar artery) mainly supplies the brainstem and parts of the cerebellum; Option C is presumed to represent the Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) and is correct; Option D is blank. Thus, the marked answer (C) is correct.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. PCA strokes classically cause contralateral homonymous hemianopia with possible macular sparing. 2. Rapid recognition and imaging are critical in stroke management. 3. Timely intervention with thrombolytic therapy (when indicated) can improve outcomes.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent AHA/ASA guidelines stress the importance of rapid imaging and intervention in acute ischemic strokes.

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nSickle cell anemia is characterized by the abnormal deformation of red blood cells under stress. This predisposes patients to vaso-occlusive crises, which can manifest in various organs, including the brain. In the context of stroke, various triggers can provoke sickling and endothelial injury leading to vaso-occlusion.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIn sickle cell disease, under conditions of physical stress (including surgical stress, trauma, or strenuous activity), hypoxia and acidosis can promote the polymerization of hemoglobin S. This results in the sickling of red blood cells, microvascular occlusion, and ultimately ischemic injury to brain tissue, which may manifest as transient neurological deficits or stroke.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nPatients with sickle cell disease may present with recurrent neurological deficits or stroke-like episodes. In this scenario, the patient\u2019s history of surgery following a bone fracture (a significant physical stressor) is a common trigger for a vaso-occlusive crisis leading to stroke.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical history (repeated episodes of weakness), neuroimaging (MRI can show ischemic lesions), and transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to assess cerebral blood flow velocities. Differential diagnoses include embolic strokes from other causes, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attacks related to other vasculopathies.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe primary management strategy includes avoiding or mitigating provoked crises by managing triggers (such as dehydration, hypoxia, and stress). Acute stroke management in sickle cell patients may include exchange transfusions to reduce the percentage of sickled cells. Long-term management includes hydroxyurea and regular blood transfusions to reduce stroke risk. In pregnancy and lactation, these therapies are used with caution, and multidisciplinary approaches are recommended to balance maternal health with fetal safety.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Physical stress) is the recognized trigger in many vaso-occlusive episodes leading to stroke in sickle cell patients, making it correct. Option B (Emotional stress) can contribute but is less commonly the direct precipitant. Option C (Hypertension) is a risk factor for stroke in general but is not the predominant trigger in sickle cell crises. Option D (Hyperventilation) is not typically associated with inducing sickling events.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Sickle cell crises are often precipitated by physical stress, such as surgery or trauma. 2. Recurrent neurological deficits in sickle cell patients warrant evaluation for stroke. 3. Preventative strategies, including blood transfusions and hydroxyurea, can reduce recurrence.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent research supports the role of physical stress in precipitating vaso-occlusive crises that lead to stroke in sickle cell patients. Current guidelines emphasize early intervention with exchange transfusions and novel disease-modifying agents to limit recurrence, with adjustments in management protocols during pregnancy.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) requires prompt management to prevent hematoma expansion and secondary brain injury. Blood pressure control is a vital component of the acute management strategy. In this clinical scenario, even though the blood pressure is moderately elevated (170/90 mmHg), immediate pharmacologic intervention is warranted.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nIn ICH, elevated blood pressure can lead to further bleeding by increasing the hydrostatic pressure within compromised vessels. Tight blood pressure control using intravenous agents helps to mitigate hematoma expansion. The choice of agent is also guided by its rapid onset and ease of titration.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nA patient two days post-ICH with a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg might be at risk for further hemorrhagic extension. The laboratory data being within normal limits (aside from a marginally low platelet count of 145, which remains within acceptable ranges for most interventions) support the decision to manage blood pressure rather than pursue transfusion.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed by CT imaging showing an intracerebral hemorrhage. Differential considerations include hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke, coagulopathy-related bleeding, or vascular malformations. Laboratory evaluation, including platelet counts and coagulation profiles, helps rule out bleeding diatheses.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nThe first-line management in ICH with moderately elevated blood pressure involves the use of intravenous antihypertensives such as labetalol, which is preferred for its quick onset and ease of titration. Second-line agents include nicardipine. Oral agents like amlodipine are avoided in the hyperacute setting due to their slower onset. Platelet transfusion is only indicated if the platelet count is significantly low (usually <50 x 10\u2079/L) or in patients on antiplatelet agents. In pregnancy, labetalol is widely accepted as a first-line antihypertensive, and its use remains appropriate during lactation.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (Labetalol) is the most appropriate choice for rapid blood pressure control in acute ICH. Option B (Amlodipine) is not ideal for acute management because it is typically administered orally and does not allow rapid titration. Option C (Platelet transfusion) is not indicated since the platelet count, although marginally low, remains near normal levels. Option D is blank.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. Rapid blood pressure control in ICH is crucial to prevent hemorrhage expansion. 2. IV labetalol is a first-line agent in both general and obstetric populations. 3. Platelet transfusions are reserved for significant thrombocytopenia or antiplatelet agent use.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nThe latest AHA/ASA guidelines for the management of intracerebral hemorrhage continue to endorse the use of IV labetalol (or nicardipine) for emergent blood pressure management. Recent studies have underscored the importance of moderate blood pressure reduction to balance the risks of hematoma expansion with the risks of cerebral hypoperfusion.",

    "explanation": "**Conceptual Foundation**\n\nPostpartum neurological emergencies include a variety of conditions such as Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) and Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS). Both conditions can occur in the postpartum setting and may share overlapping clinical features, but specific imaging findings help to differentiate them.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nRCVS is characterized by transient, multifocal narrowing of the cerebral arteries due to dysregulation of cerebral vascular tone. It is commonly triggered by the postpartum state, and factors such as the use of serotonergic medications (like SSRIs) can contribute. In contrast, PRES involves vasogenic edema secondary to blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, often in the context of severe hypertension. The presence of angiographic changes (e.g., a 'string of beads' appearance) is more consistent with RCVS.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nIn a postpartum patient with a history of SSRI use, the development of neurological symptoms along with imaging findings on CT and abnormal angiographic features strongly points to RCVS. Patients typically present with thunderclap headaches and may have transient neurological deficits. Although PRES is also seen postpartum, its hallmark is symmetrical vasogenic edema predominantly in the posterior regions of the cerebral hemispheres, without the characteristic segmental arterial constriction seen in RCVS.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach**\n\nThe diagnostic approach involves neuroimaging. MRI is optimal for detecting the vasogenic edema of PRES, while CT angiography or digital subtraction angiography can reveal the multifocal segmental narrowing typical of RCVS. Differential diagnoses include cerebral vasculitis, which tends to have a more chronic course, and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is excluded by the imaging pattern.\n\n**Management Principles**\n\nManagement of RCVS is primarily supportive. Calcium channel blockers (such as nimodipine) are commonly employed to alleviate vasospasm, and pain management is crucial. Blood pressure is typically not as dramatically elevated as in PRES, so aggressive antihypertensive therapy is less central. In postpartum patients, including those who are breastfeeding, medications like nimodipine are considered relatively safe, but individualized risk\u2010benefit analysis is still essential. For PRES, management focuses on blood pressure control and withdrawal of the inciting agent. The distinction between the two is important for guiding therapy.\n\n**Option Analysis**\n\nOption A (PRES) represents one of the differential diagnoses; however, the inclusion of angiographic findings (typically not a feature of PRES) suggests that the diagnosis is more in line with RCVS. Option B (presumed here to be RCVS) is the better match given the patient\u2019s postpartum status, the SSRI association, and the angiographic findings. Options C and D are not provided. Thus, the marked answer B is correct.\n\n**Clinical Pearls**\n\n1. RCVS often presents in postpartum women with severe, thunderclap headaches and reversible arterial narrowing on angiography. 2. SSRIs and the postpartum state are recognized triggers for RCVS. 3. Differentiation between RCVS and PRES is critical, as management strategies differ.\n\n**Current Evidence**\n\nRecent literature has further delineated the diagnostic criteria for RCVS, emphasizing the role of vascular imaging to identify reversible vasoconstriction. Current guidelines advocate for supportive care with calcium channel blockers, and emerging research continues to refine the management protocols for postpartum patients presenting with these syndromes.",
