        "conceptual_foundation": "Weber syndrome is a classical brainstem stroke syndrome characterized by ipsilateral oculomotor nerve dysfunction (manifesting as ptosis and ophthalmoplegia) and contralateral motor deficits. It results from a lesion in the midbrain.",
        "pathophysiology": "The syndrome is typically due to infarction or hemorrhage at the ventral (basal) portion of the midbrain affecting the exiting fibers of the oculomotor nerve and the corticospinal tracts that travel through the cerebral peduncles. The lesion is usually vascular in origin, commonly involving branches of the posterior cerebral artery.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients present with an ipsilateral third cranial nerve palsy (leading to diplopia and ptosis) along with contralateral hemiparesis, which reflects the involvement of adjacent motor pathways.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Neuroimaging (MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging) is key in confirming the lesion in the ventral midbrain. Differential diagnoses include other midbrain syndromes such as Benedikt’s syndrome, which additionally includes tremor and ataxia due to red nucleus involvement.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Weber syndrome falls under the category of midbrain or brainstem strokes, specifically classified by vascular territory involvement of the paramedian branches of the posterior cerebral artery.",
        "management_principles": "Acute management follows standard stroke protocols including thrombolysis (if within window and no contraindications), blood pressure control, and supportive care. For patients who are pregnant or lactating, thrombolytic therapy and supportive measures are considered on a case-by-case basis following current AHA/ASA guidelines, with multidisciplinary consultation.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (Base of midbrain) is correct because Weber syndrome classically involves the ventral midbrain (basis pedunculi), not the tegmentum (dorsal aspect) or the tectum (posterior aspect).",
        "clinical_pearls": "1. Weber syndrome is marked by the combination of oculomotor dysfunction and contralateral motor weakness. 2. Lesions are localized to the ventral midbrain. 3. Vascular supply from the posterior cerebral artery is typically implicated.",
        "current_evidence": "Recent imaging studies and guidelines continue to support the ventral midbrain localization in Weber syndrome. Management strategies align with broader ischemic stroke management protocols adapted to brainstem strokes."

        "pathophysiology": "Atherosclerotic disease of the left middle cerebral artery leads to luminal narrowing, reduced cerebral perfusion, and ultimately ischemia in the dependent brain territories. The resulting stroke produces contralateral motor and language deficits due to involvement of the dominant hemisphere.",
        "clinical_correlation": "The presentation of right-sided weakness and dysphasia reflects the involvement of the left MCA territory, which is responsible for motor control of the contralateral side of the body and language functions (in the dominant hemisphere).",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Diagnosis involves neuroimaging with CT/MRI to confirm infarct and vessel imaging (CTA/MRA) to assess the degree of stenosis. Differential considerations include embolic stroke from cardiac sources and lacunar strokes. Carotid duplex is more relevant for extracranial disease.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "This condition is classified as a form of ischemic stroke secondary to intracranial atherosclerosis. It falls under large-artery atherosclerotic strokes as categorized by the TOAST classification.",
        "management_principles": "First-line management is aggressive medical therapy with dual antiplatelet therapy (typically aspirin and clopidogrel) for a duration based on recent trials (e.g., 21-90 days, often 90 days in high-risk individuals). Second-line interventions, such as stenting or endarterectomy, are largely reserved for extracranial stenosis (e.g., carotid endarterectomy) and are not first-line for intracranial lesions. In pregnant or lactating patients with stroke, low-dose aspirin is generally considered safe, with careful multidisciplinary management tailoring the risk–benefit ratio.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (endarterectomy) is typically used for extracranial carotid stenosis and is not indicated for intracranial MCA stenosis. Option B (stenting) has been explored in clinical trials (e.g., SAMMPRIS) but has shown higher periprocedural risks compared to aggressive medical management. Option C (Aspirin and Plavix) is correct, representing the current standard of care for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease.",
        "clinical_pearls": "1. Intracranial atherosclerotic strokes are best managed medically with dual antiplatelet therapy. 2. Differentiation between intracranial and extracranial pathology is crucial when considering revascularization strategies. 3. SAMMPRIS trial data influenced the move toward medical management in these cases.",

        "pathophysiology": "This syndrome is most commonly encountered with infarcts in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA), particularly affecting the left occipital lobe and often involving the splenium of the corpus callosum. The lesion disrupts visual processing and the transfer of visual information to language areas.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients with this syndrome can write and speak fluently, but when they attempt to read, whether it is their own writing or printed words, they are unable to decode the visual stimuli into meaningful language. This dissociation between reading and writing highlights the localization of the lesion.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Neuroimaging (MRI) is essential for localizing the infarct, which typically involves the left occipital lobe. Differential diagnoses include other language disorders such as aphasia; however, in pure alexia, the preservation of spoken language distinguishes it from more global aphasic syndromes.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Alexia without agraphia is categorized as a disconnection syndrome within the spectrum of stroke syndromes and is most commonly due to ischemic strokes within the posterior cerebral artery distribution.",
        "management_principles": "Acute management follows standard ischemic stroke protocols, including consideration for thrombolytic therapy if within the appropriate time window. Long-term management involves antiplatelet therapy, risk factor modification, and rehabilitation (including occupational and speech therapy). In pregnant or lactating patients, aspirin is typically acceptable with multidisciplinary review to balance risks and benefits, while thrombolytic therapy is used only under strict guidelines.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (PCA) is correct because the syndrome of pure alexia is most commonly associated with infarcts in the left PCA territory. Option B (PICA) is incorrect as it typically supplies parts of the cerebellum and lateral brainstem rather than the occipital lobe.",

        "conceptual_foundation": "Watershed infarctions occur at the border zones between major cerebral arteries. In cases where DWI imaging shows a unilateral watershed pattern, it raises concern for hemodynamic compromise, most commonly due to an upstream arterial stenosis (often in the internal carotid artery). The next logical step is to evaluate the vascular anatomy, which is best done with vascular imaging such as a CTA.",
        "pathophysiology": "Watershed zones are vulnerable to hypoperfusion. When there is significant stenosis or occlusion (commonly in the carotid circulation), these areas receive less than adequate blood flow, resulting in infarcts. CTA helps identify the site and severity of arterial narrowing, guiding further management.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients with watershed strokes can present with variable neurological deficits depending on the exact regions affected. The imaging pattern on DWI is distinct, and identifying the cause (such as carotid stenosis) is essential as it may alter future management, including possible revascularization procedures.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Once DWI suggests a watershed infarct, vascular imaging (CTA in this case) is indicated. Differential diagnoses include embolic strokes and small vessel disease strokes; however, their imaging and clinical histories usually differ. CTA helps differentiate a hemodynamic mechanism from an embolic one by showing vascular narrowing or occlusion.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Watershed infarcts are a subtype of ischemic strokes, often classified under large vessel atherosclerotic strokes. They are distinct from border-zone infarcts caused by embolism or lacunar infarcts from small vessel disease.",
        "management_principles": "After identifying a watershed infarct with CTA, management includes optimizing blood pressure, antiplatelet therapy, and addressing the underlying cause such as carotid atherosclerosis. For patients who are pregnant or lactating, CTA can be performed with proper shielding, and risk factor management (blood pressure, lipids) should follow guidelines that take maternal and fetal safety into account.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (CTA) is correct because it provides crucial information on the vascular status (e.g., carotid/vertebral arteries) that likely contributed to the watershed infarct. The other options were either not provided or not appropriate for the next step in this scenario.",
        "clinical_pearls": "1) Unilateral watershed infarctions on DWI should prompt an evaluation for significant ipsilateral carotid stenosis. 2) Vascular imaging is a key next step in differentiating hemodynamic strokes from embolic phenomena.",
        "current_evidence": "Recent AHA/ASA guidelines emphasize early vessel imaging in acute ischemic stroke patients. Emerging research also supports the prompt use of CTA to lay the groundwork for possible interventions such as carotid revascularization if significant stenosis is identified."

        "pathophysiology": "tPA works by catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, the enzyme responsible for breaking down fibrin clots. In the context of an ischemic stroke, the timely dissolution of the clot can restore blood flow, salvaging penumbral brain tissue.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients presenting with acute stroke symptoms require rapid evaluation including a non-contrast CT to exclude hemorrhage. If within 3-4.5 hours (and meeting other criteria) tPA is recommended. The older man in the scenario is an appropriate candidate assuming no contraindications are found on further workup.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Initial assessment requires neuroimaging (usually a CT scan) to rule out hemorrhage. After confirming an ischemic event, the patient’s history, time of symptom onset, and contraindications are reviewed. Differential diagnoses include stroke mimics like seizures or migraine, but the acute focal neurological deficits help distinguish true stroke.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "This management falls under the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Guidelines separately classify acute stroke treatment strategies based on time windows – with tPA being the cornerstone for early management.",
        "management_principles": "The first-line management for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke is IV tPA, ideally given within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Subsequent treatments may include endovascular therapies if a large vessel occlusion is found. In pregnant or lactating women, tPA has been used with caution in select cases after weighing maternal and fetal risks, and consultation with specialists is advised.",

Recent studies have also explored extended time windows and advanced imaging techniques, but standard practice remains to initiate tPA as early as possible within the defined window."

The syndrome is most classically attributed to infarction in the territory supplied by the anterior spinal artery.",
        "pathophysiology": "The medial medulla is supplied primarily by the anterior spinal artery, a branch arising from the vertebral arteries. Occlusion of this vessel leads to infarction of structures in the medial medulla including the pyramids (causing weakness), medial lemniscus (affecting sensation), and the hypoglossal nerve nucleus (resulting in tongue deviation).",
        "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, patients typically present with contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss along with tongue deviation toward the side of the lesion. This constellation of signs helps differentiate medial medullary syndrome from other brainstem strokes such as lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is the modality of choice to identify medullary infarcts. To differentiate medial medullary syndrome from other brainstem strokes, vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) can be employed to assess the vertebral and anterior spinal arteries. Differential diagnoses include lateral medullary syndrome and pontine strokes, which have different clinical and imaging features.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Medial medullary syndrome is classified as a brainstem stroke and is specifically due to infarction in the medial medulla. It is most frequently associated with occlusion of the anterior spinal artery, although sometimes the paramedian branches of the vertebral artery may be implicated.",
        "management_principles": "The management of medial medullary syndrome involves standard acute ischemic stroke protocols including potential thrombolysis, antiplatelet therapy thereafter, and aggressive risk factor management (e.g., controlling hypertension, dyslipidemia). In pregnant or lactating patients, treatment must be balanced with safety concerns, and nonpharmacologic measures or medications with established safety profiles in pregnancy should be considered.",
        "option_analysis": "Option B (Anterior spinal artery) is considered correct because infarction in medial medullary syndrome is most commonly due to occlusion of the anterior spinal artery. Option A (Vertebral artery) is less specific – although the vertebral artery gives rise to the anterior spinal artery, the classic lesion localizes to the territory of the anterior spinal artery rather than from a direct vertebral artery occlusion.",

In a patient already on antihypertensive and statin medication with borderline glycemic control (HbA1c ~6.9), weight reduction can significantly reduce overall stroke risk.",
        "pathophysiology": "Obesity contributes to a pro-inflammatory state, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased blood pressure—all of which favor atherosclerosis and increase the risk of stroke. Weight reduction has been shown to improve these metabolic parameters and reduce vascular inflammation.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients with obesity and hypertension are at an elevated risk for stroke due not only to high blood pressure but also because obesity worsens other metabolic risk factors. Weight reduction, therefore, becomes a central pillar of primary stroke prevention in such individuals.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "A thorough clinical assessment including vital signs, laboratory studies (such as HbA1c, fasting glucose, and lipid profile), and measurement of BMI is key for risk stratification. Differential diagnoses for stroke prevention strategies could include adjustments in antihypertensive regimes or initiation of diabetes medications, but lifestyle modification remains universally recommended as first-line.",

        "management_principles": "The first-line management for such a patient is lifestyle modification—with weight reduction being paramount. This includes dietary changes, increased physical activity, and sometimes structured weight loss programs. While continuing antihypertensives and statins is essential, adding medications like metformin is reserved for established type 2 diabetes mellitus. Aspirin is not routinely recommended for primary prevention in all patients due to bleeding risks. In pregnancy and lactation, lifestyle modifications are especially prioritized to avoid medication side effects.",
        "option_analysis": "Option C (Weight reduction) is the best answer since it addresses the root modifiable risk factor. Option A (Perindopril) is already part of his antihypertensive regimen and further intensification would depend on blood pressure targets. Option B (Metformin) is not indicated unless he meets criteria for diabetes. Option D (Aspirin) has a limited role in primary prevention due to potential bleeding risks and is not the most effective choice here.",

        "pathophysiology": "In ICH, a ruptured cerebral vessel causes blood to accumulate within the brain parenchyma. Elevated blood pressure increases hydrostatic pressure on the vulnerable vessel walls, risking continued bleeding and hematoma enlargement. Controlling blood pressure minimizes further vessel disruption and secondary damage.",
        "clinical_correlation": "A patient presenting with acute left-sided weakness and dysarthria, in the context of a right-sided hemorrhage on CT, reflects the neurological deficits caused by mass effect and neuronal injury. The moderately elevated systolic pressure (167 mm Hg) is significant enough in this setting to justify immediate antihypertensive therapy.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "The gold standard in the acute setting is a non-contrast CT scan to identify ICH. Differential diagnoses include ischemic stroke (which typically shows no blood on the CT scan), subarachnoid hemorrhage (which has a different distribution on imaging), and stroke mimics such as tumors or seizures. Rapid imaging confirms the diagnosis, guiding early management.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Intracerebral hemorrhage can be classified based on location (lobar, deep, cerebellar) and underlying cause (hypertensive, amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformations). This case is most consistent with a hypertensive hemorrhage, where blood pressure control is paramount.",

Labetalol is a common first-line agent because of its rapid action and easy titration. Second-line approaches include using agents like nicardipine if labetalol is contraindicated. Neurosurgical intervention is reserved for cases with mass effect, imminent herniation, or specific locations (e.g., cerebellar hemorrhage). In pregnant and lactating patients, labetalol is also the antihypertensive of choice due to its well‐established safety profile in these populations.",

Option B (factor 7 infusion) is not indicated; recombinant activated factor VII has been studied in hemorrhage but is associated with thrombotic risks and is not standard care in ICH. Option C (referral for neurosurgery for evacuation) is typically reserved for selected cases (e.g., cerebellar hemorrhages or those with significant mass effect) and is not the immediate priority in a patient with modest blood pressure elevation and a spontaneous ICH.",

The primary goal is stroke prevention, and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has been shown to reduce early recurrent stroke risk in high-risk or minor TIA patients.",
        "pathophysiology": "TIAs typically result from transient thromboembolic events that temporarily interrupt cerebral blood flow. Platelet aggregation plays a crucial role in clot propagation, and using two antiplatelet agents can interrupt this process, reducing the risk of full-blown stroke.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients with TIA often have transient symptoms that resolve completely yet signal an increased risk for future stroke. Prompt initiation of therapy is thus essential to reduce this high early risk.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Diagnosis involves a careful clinical history and supportive imaging (brain CT or MRI) to rule out acute infarction. Differential diagnoses include migraine with aura, seizures, and other non-vascular events. Risk stratification scores, such as the ABCD2 score, help assess the risk of stroke following a TIA.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "TIAs are classified as cerebrovascular events with clinical symptoms lasting less than 24 hours without acute infarction. They are considered a warning sign and an opportunity for early intervention to prevent stroke.",
        "management_principles": "First-line treatment for high-risk TIA typically involves dual antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin plus clopidogrel) for a short course (typically 21–90 days) based on evidence from the CHANCE and POINT trials. Subsequent management includes long-term single antiplatelet therapy, risk factor modification (such as blood pressure and cholesterol control), and lifestyle changes. In pregnancy, low-dose aspirin is generally considered safe, but clopidogrel has less robust data; decisions should weigh risks versus benefits carefully. In lactating patients, aspirin at low doses is acceptable, though caution with clopidogrel is advised.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (Dual antiplatelet therapy) is correct as studies have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing early recurrent stroke risk in TIA patients. Although other options exist (such as single antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, or immediate statin therapy), the evidence clearly supports short-term DAPT in patients with high-risk TIA.",
        "clinical_pearls": "• TIA is a critical warning sign for stroke; prompt DAPT can significantly reduce recurrence risk.\n• The CHANCE and POINT trials established the role of DAPT in the early management of TIA.\n• Risk factor modification remains an essential part of long-term stroke prevention.",
        "current_evidence": "Recent guidelines, supported by the CHANCE and POINT trials, advise the use of dual antiplatelet therapy for a limited period immediately following a high-risk TIA to reduce early recurrent stroke risk."

        "conceptual_foundation": "Risk stratification in patients with intracranial aneurysms involves identifying features that most strongly predict rupture. Aneurysm size remains a critical factor in many validated scoring systems and risk models.",
        "pathophysiology": "The rupture of an aneurysm is primarily due to hemodynamic stress and wall weakening. Larger aneurysms have increased wall tension, making them more susceptible to rupture. Other factors, such as location and uncontrolled hypertension, also contribute, but size is often the primary measurable predictor.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Aneurysms located at the anterior communicating (ACOM) artery carry an inherently higher risk of rupture even when they are small. However, the overall risk of rupture increases in correlation with aneurysm size, which is used to guide the decision towards surgical or endovascular repair.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Imaging tests, including CT angiography (CTA), MR angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), are used to evaluate aneurysm size, shape, and location. Differential diagnoses include pseudoaneurysms or vascular malformations. Detailed imaging is necessary to discern the rupture risk and plan management.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Intracranial aneurysms are categorized by size (small, medium, large, giant), morphology (saccular, fusiform), and location (anterior vs. posterior circulation). Risk scoring systems like the PHASES score integrate aneurysm size as the dominant factor in predicting rupture risk.",
        "management_principles": "Management is tiered: small, low-risk aneurysms may be observed with serial imaging, while larger aneurysms (or those with concerning features) are managed with surgical clipping or endovascular coiling. Aggressive blood pressure control is important in all patients. In pregnant or lactating patients, treatment plans are individualized; non-ionizing imaging modalities and careful management of blood pressure and anesthesia risks are prioritized.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (Size) is correct because numerous studies and risk scoring systems (like PHASES) underscore aneurysm size as the most predictive factor of rupture. Option B is incorrect because aneurysms in the anterior communicating artery are known to have a higher rupture risk rather than being 'less likely' to rupture. Option C (Uncontrolled blood pressure), while a modifiable risk factor for rupture, is less predictive than the inherent structural feature of aneurysm size.",
        "clinical_pearls": "• Aneurysm size is a key criterion in determining rupture risk; aneurysms above certain thresholds (e.g., >7 mm) are higher risk.\n• ACOM aneurysms are particularly dangerous and may rupture even at smaller sizes.\n• Integrating size with other factors (such as morphology and location) improves risk stratification.",
        "current_evidence": "Recent systematic reviews and updated scoring systems continue to emphasize the predictive value of aneurysm size. The PHASES score remains a widely used tool in clinical practice, alongside emerging research that refines risk prediction models."

Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound is the validated screening tool designed to measure cerebral blood flow velocities, which are correlated with stroke risk.",
        "pathophysiology": "Sickle cell anemia leads to chronic endothelial injury and vasculopathy, resulting in arterial stenosis. As vessels narrow, blood flow velocity increases, which can be detected by TCD. Elevated velocities indicate a compensatory mechanism for reduced lumen diameter and predict an increased risk of ischemic stroke.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Screening with TCD is particularly important in children with SCD, as early identification of abnormal flow velocities allows for timely intervention (e.g., chronic transfusion therapy) to reduce stroke risk. Even in adult patients, TCD may help in risk assessment if there is a concerning family or personal history of stroke.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "TCD is non-invasive, cost-effective, and has no radiation exposure, making it ideal for repeated screening. Alternative imaging (such as CTA or MRA) may further delineate vascular anatomy but are not used for routine screening due to risks associated with radiation and contrast use.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Cerebrovascular complications of sickle cell disease are classified based on their risk for stroke. TCD screening is a cornerstone of preventive neurology in pediatric sickle cell populations and is used in risk stratification protocols.",

Hydroxyurea is another option that may be used to reduce sickling. In pregnant or lactating patients, careful management is needed to balance the benefits of transfusion therapy with potential complications, and non-ionizing imaging like TCD remains the preferred screening modality.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (Transcranial Doppler) is correct because it is the standard, widely recommended screening tool for predicting stroke risk in individuals with sickle cell disease. Option B (CTA) is less favored due to the exposure to radiation and contrast agents, and it is not validated as a screening tool in this population.",

        "conceptual_foundation": "In the acute stroke setting, a non-contrast CT scan is typically the first imaging modality used to exclude hemorrhage. However, early in ischemic stroke, CT may appear normal due to the time lag before radiographic changes become evident. Thus, vascular imaging such as CT angiography (CTA) is critical to evaluate the cerebral vessels for occlusions or stenoses, especially when thrombolysis isn’t an option.",
        "pathophysiology": "Ischemic strokes result from an interruption of blood flow, often due to an occlusive thrombus or embolus. In the hyperacute phase, cytotoxic edema has not yet produced clear changes on CT. CTA, by visualizing the cerebral vasculature, can detect large vessel occlusions which underlie the infarct and help determine patient eligibility for interventions such as thrombectomy.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients presenting with clinical signs of stroke may have a normal CT scan if imaged very early. CTA is then utilized to assess for large vessel occlusions that may not be evident on non-contrast CT, guiding further management decisions. Recognizing that a normal CT can be misleading is key to timely diagnosis and treatment.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "The differential diagnosis includes transient ischemic attack (TIA), migraine with aura, and other conditions mimicking stroke. The diagnostic approach generally begins with a non-contrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, followed by CTA or CT perfusion studies to evaluate ischemic tissue and vascular status.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Stroke is broadly classified into ischemic and hemorrhagic types. Ischemic strokes can be further categorized based on the vessel involved (large vessel occlusion versus small vessel disease). CTA is particularly useful in identifying occlusions in large vessels such as the MCA or ICA.",
        "management_principles": "Current guidelines recommend rapid imaging in suspected stroke. When CT is normal in a patient with stroke symptoms, a CTA is indicated to identify occlusions that could be amenable to endovascular therapy. In patients who are pregnant or lactating, the benefits of CTA (with appropriate shielding) outweigh the risks, as early detection and intervention are critical.",

Occlusion or infarction in this region disrupts language comprehension while sparing speech fluency, producing the classical picture of Wernicke’s aphasia.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, patients with Wernicke’s aphasia present with fluent speech that may include paraphasias and neologisms, along with significant comprehension deficits. Recognizing the vascular territory affected helps correlate the clinical syndrome with its underlying vascular pathology.",

Although the exact cause remains unclear, hormonal factors (given its predilection for middle‐aged women) and genetic factors are thought to contribute. This multifocal vascular involvement means that both cerebral and renal arteries can be affected.",

These constellation of symptoms are pathognomonic for lateral medullary syndrome due to PICA occlusion.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed with neuroimaging (CT/MRI) showing infarction in the lateral medulla. Vascular imaging (CTA, MRA, or catheter angiography) can identify the occluded vessel. Differential diagnoses include lateral pontine syndrome (often due to AICA occlusion) and other posterior circulation strokes, which can be differentiated based on both imaging and the specific neurological deficits present.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Wallenberg syndrome falls under the broader category of ischemic strokes involving the brainstem. It is specifically categorized by its distinct clinical syndrome and the vascular territory – that of the PICA – involved in the infarct.",
        "management_principles": "Acute management follows standard stroke care with consideration for intravenous thrombolytic therapy if the patient presents within the appropriate window. Secondary prevention includes the use of antiplatelet agents and management of vascular risk factors. In pregnancy, special care must be taken when considering thrombolysis – weighing maternal benefits against fetal risks – and medications with proven safety profiles should be selected.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A, 'PICA,' is the correct choice because occlusion of the Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery is the most frequent cause of lateral medullary syndrome. Option B mentioning the 'no vertebral artery in options' distracts from the core pathology. Options C and D are not provided.",
        "clinical_pearls": "1) Lateral medullary syndrome is characterized by a cross-sensory deficit (ipsilateral facial, contralateral body pain/temperature loss). 2) Occlusion of the PICA is the prototypical cause of this syndrome. 3) Early recognition is crucial for timely intervention, particularly regarding acute stroke management.",
        "current_evidence": "Current guidelines emphasize rapid neuroimaging and prompt initiation of acute stroke therapies. Recent studies support the use of advanced imaging techniques that enhance early detection of posterior circulation strokes, and further refine selection criteria for thrombolytic or endovascular therapies even in the complex anatomical region of the brainstem."

It typically lacks the inflammatory or infectious changes seen in other CNS vasculopathies.",
        "pathophysiology": "RCVS is thought to result from transient disturbances in the regulation of cerebral arterial tone. This leads to multifocal vasoconstriction without the accompanying blood–brain barrier disruption or significant inflammatory response that one would see in infections or primary angiitis of the central nervous system.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, patients with RCVS present with recurrent thunderclap headaches. Neurological deficits may arise if the vasoconstriction results in ischemic injury. Since the underlying process is noninflammatory, CSF studies are typically normal or near-normal.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "The workup includes careful neuroimaging (CT, MRI, MRA, or catheter angiography) to document the segmental vasoconstriction and repeat studies to confirm reversibility. A lumbar puncture is performed primarily to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage or CNS vasculitis. Differential diagnoses include subarachnoid hemorrhage, primary angiitis of the CNS (which usually shows pleocytosis and a more marked protein elevation), and central nervous system infections.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "RCVS falls into the category of non-inflammatory vasculopathies. It is distinct from primary CNS vasculitis both in its reversible nature and in its typical CSF profile, which lacks significant inflammatory markers.",
        "management_principles": "First-line management generally includes calcium channel blockers (such as nimodipine) to help relieve vasoconstriction and supportive care including pain management. Avoidance of triggers (e.g., vasoactive substances like serotonergic drugs) is also recommended. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of medications must be carefully considered; agents with more favorable safety profiles (and consultation with maternal–fetal medicine) are preferred.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A, 'slightly high protein,' is acceptable in this context. Although RCVS is classically associated with normal CSF, minor nonspecific protein elevation (without significant pleocytosis) can occasionally be observed. The other options (not detailed here) are clearly less representative of the typical CSF findings in RCVS.",
        "clinical_pearls": "1) RCVS is best known for its thunderclap headaches and reversible vascular changes on imaging. 2) The CSF in RCVS is typically normal or nearly normal, which helps distinguish it from inflammatory vasculopathies such as primary angiitis of the CNS. 3) Prompt recognition and differentiation from other causes of severe headache are critical to prevent complications.",
        "current_evidence": "Recent studies have confirmed that mild CSF protein elevation (if present) in RCVS does not indicate an inflammatory process. Emerging research continues to refine diagnostic criteria and optimal management strategies for RCVS, emphasizing the importance of multimodal imaging and careful clinical monitoring."

        "pathophysiology": "The disease is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which lead to abnormal accumulation of granular osmiophilic material in the smooth muscle cells of small arteries. This accumulation results in progressive arteriopathy, with consequent subcortical infarcts and white matter changes. The pathophysiological process underpins the clinical signs of migraine, recurrent strokes, and cognitive decline.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients with CADASIL typically present in early to mid-adulthood with migraine (often with aura), recurrent lacunar strokes, mood disturbances, and a progressive subcortical dementia. MRI findings classically reveal white matter hyperintensities involving the periventricular areas and the anterior temporal lobes.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "The diagnosis of CADASIL is based on a characteristic clinical picture, typical MRI findings, and can be confirmed with genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations. A skin biopsy demonstrating granular osmiophilic material can also support the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include other causes of small vessel disease and leukoencephalopathies such as multiple sclerosis or vascular dementia, which can be distinguished based on imaging, family history, and specific clinical features.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "CADASIL is categorized as a genetic microangiopathy and falls within the group of hereditary cerebral small vessel diseases. It is distinct due to its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and the unique involvement of the NOTCH3 signaling pathway.",

This includes aggressive control of vascular risk factors (such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia), antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention, and symptomatic management of migraines and mood disturbances. Genetic counseling is crucial for affected individuals and family members. In pregnant or lactating women, special attention to blood pressure control and medication safety is required, with agents selected based on their safety profile in pregnancy (e.g., labetalol for hypertension).",

        "conceptual_foundation": "Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is the most common type of spinal vascular malformation. It involves an abnormal connection between a dural artery and a bridging medullary vein, leading to venous congestion and progressive myelopathy.",
        "pathophysiology": "In DAVF, arterial blood is shunted directly into the venous system without the normal capillary bed. This results in elevated venous pressure, impaired venous drainage, and subsequent spinal cord ischemia. The resulting venous congestion leads to chronic spinal cord edema and neurological deficits.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients with spinal DAVF typically present with slowly progressive weakness and sensory disturbances in the lower extremities, along with gait abnormalities. The condition is most commonly seen in middle-aged to elderly males. MRI findings often reveal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord (indicative of edema) and serpiginous flow voids representing dilated vessels.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Initial assessment with MRI of the spine is essential, as it can suggest the diagnosis by showing cord edema and abnormal flow voids. However, spinal angiography remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, allowing precise localization and characterization of the fistula. Differential diagnoses include intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and cavernomas, but these have differing clinical and imaging features.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Spinal vascular malformations are generally classified into dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs), intramedullary AVMs, and cavernous malformations. DAVFs are distinct due to their location (usually in the dura) and their mechanism of causing venous congestion, unlike AVMs which are intramedullary and more prone to hemorrhage.",
        "management_principles": "The treatment of spinal DAVF typically involves endovascular embolization or microsurgical disconnection to interrupt the abnormal shunt. In pregnant patients or those who are lactating, careful risk–benefit assessment is necessary as angiographic procedures involve radiation and contrast agents, which may be deferred or managed with modifications based on current guidelines. Multidisciplinary management is crucial to optimize neurological outcomes.",
        "option_analysis": "The options provided were DAVF, cavernoma, and AVM. Cavernomas are usually benign vascular lesions that may present with hemorrhages but do not lead to venous congestion as seen in DAVF. Intramedullary AVMs often present with hemorrhage rather than the progressive myelopathic symptoms typical of DAVF. Thus, the option DAVF best fits the clinical scenario of progressive symptoms related to a spinal fistula.",
        "clinical_pearls": "Early recognition of spinal DAVF is essential as treatment can prevent irreversible spinal cord damage. Clues on MRI such as cord signal hyperintensity and flow voids should lead to angiographic confirmation. A multidisciplinary approach, including neurosurgery and interventional neuroradiology, is recommended.",
        "current_evidence": "Current guidelines support endovascular embolization as a first-line treatment for spinal DAVF when feasible, with surgical intervention as an alternative in selected cases. Recent studies emphasize the importance of early intervention to halt progression of myelopathy and improve long-term outcomes. Special considerations for pregnant or lactating patients include minimizing fetal radiation exposure and using alternative imaging modalities or protective measures when necessary."

        "conceptual_foundation": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the formation of antibodies against phospholipid-binding proteins (notably anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I). These antibodies predispose patients to both arterial and venous thrombotic events. In this case, the patient’s history, including a prior lower limb DVT and a stroke, is consistent with thrombotic manifestations of APS.",
        "pathophysiology": "In APS, the autoantibodies induce a hypercoagulable state by activating endothelial cells, platelets, and complement pathways, while interfering with the natural anticoagulant mechanisms. This results in an increased risk for clot formation in both the arterial and venous systems. The presence of high titers of anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies confirms the autoimmune-mediated coagulation dysregulation.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients with APS frequently present with recurrent thrombotic events such as DVTs and cerebrovascular accidents (strokes), as seen in this patient. Although a small patent foramen ovale (PFO) was incidentally detected, the hypercoagulable state from APS is the primary concern, and the PFO does not change the management approach in this context.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "The diagnosis of APS is based on the revised Sapporo criteria (or Sydney criteria), which require: 1) a clinical history of vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity, and 2) laboratory confirmation of antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin, anti-beta2 glycoprotein I, or lupus anticoagulant) on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. Differential diagnoses include other hypercoagulable disorders such as inherited thrombophilias, malignancy-related thrombosis, and other autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "APS is classified into primary APS (occurring in isolation) and secondary APS (associated with other autoimmune conditions, typically SLE). In this case, with no other reported autoimmune symptoms, the patient likely has primary APS.",
        "management_principles": "Long-term anticoagulation is the cornerstone of management in APS patients with prior thrombotic events. Warfarin is the anticoagulant of choice in nonpregnant patients, with a target INR of 2-3 under standard circumstances. For women who are pregnant or lactating, warfarin is contraindicated due to its teratogenicity, and the recommended management is with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) combined with low-dose aspirin.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (DAPT) and Option D (ASA) do not provide sufficient anticoagulation in APS. Option C (closure of PFO) is not the primary treatment for preventing thromboembolic events in APS, since the hypercoagulability is the primary driver of thrombotic events rather than embolism through a PFO alone. Therefore, Option B (warfarin) is the best management choice for this patient.",
        "clinical_pearls": "1. In APS, always consider long-term anticoagulation as the patient is at high risk for recurrent thrombotic events. 2. Warfarin is the preferred treatment for nonpregnant patients; however, in pregnancy, LMWH with low-dose aspirin is advised. 3. Incidentally found PFOs in the setting of APS do not warrant closure unless they are clearly contributing to embolic events in the absence of a hypercoagulable state.",
        "current_evidence": "Recent guidelines and clinical evidence continue to advocate for the use of warfarin in patients with APS and documented thrombotic events to reduce the risk of recurrence. Studies have confirmed that maintaining an INR in the target range (typically 2-3) significantly lowers the risk of further thrombosis. In the event of pregnancy, current recommendations favor LMWH over warfarin due to the known teratogenic effects of the latter."

Its subtypes are partly defined by myositis‐specific antibodies, each correlating with different clinical patterns and systemic involvements.",
        "pathophysiology": "An autoimmune process leads to muscle fiber injury and a complement-mediated microangiopathy in the skin. Among the antibodies, the anti-synthetase group (most notably anti-Jo1) targets aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, fostering an inflammatory cascade that can also involve the lungs and result in interstitial lung disease (ILD).",
        "clinical_correlation": "In this scenario, the patient presents with muscle weakness, a classic dermatomyositis skin eruption, and a cough. The presence of cough raises the suspicion for ILD, a well-described feature in patients with anti-synthetase syndrome.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Evaluation involves a combination of clinical examination, serum creatine kinase levels, autoantibody panels (examining myositis-specific antibodies including anti-synthetase), electromyography, and often muscle biopsy. In patients with respiratory symptoms, chest imaging (e.g., high-resolution CT scan) is essential to screen for ILD.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Dermatomyositis, one of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, is subclassified based on the associated autoantibodies. These include anti-synthetase antibodies (defining the anti-synthetase syndrome with ILD, arthritis, and mechanic’s hands), anti-MDA5 (often linked with rapidly progressive ILD in clinically amyopathic DM), anti-SRP (associated with necrotizing myopathy), and anti-TIF1 (which carries a malignancy risk).",
        "management_principles": "The mainstay of management is high-dose corticosteroids along with additional immunosuppressive agents (such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil) to control muscle and lung inflammation. In cases with significant ILD, more aggressive immunomodulatory therapy may be warranted. For pregnant and lactating patients, corticosteroids remain the first-line treatment; however, agents such as methotrexate are contraindicated, so alternative therapies with better safety profiles in pregnancy must be chosen.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (Anti-synthetase antibodies) is the best answer in this scenario. Although anti-MDA5 is also associated with ILD, it is more typically seen in clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis with minimal muscle weakness. Anti-SRP is characteristically linked to severe necrotizing myopathy without significant skin manifestations, and anti-TIF1 is more commonly associated with malignancy-related dermatomyositis rather than ILD. The combination of weakness, classic DM rash, and a cough (suggesting ILD) aligns best with an anti-synthetase antibody profile.",
        "clinical_pearls": "A cough in a patient with dermatomyositis mandates a thorough evaluation for interstitial lung disease. Identifying the specific autoantibody profile is crucial, as it influences both prognostication and selection of immunosuppressive therapy. Anti-synthetase syndrome, signified by the presence of antibodies such as anti-Jo1, often includes extramuscular manifestations like ILD, arthritis, and mechanic’s hands.",
        "current_evidence": "Recent research and guidelines emphasize the importance of myositis-specific antibody testing to tailor immunosuppressive therapy. Early detection and management of ILD significantly improve outcomes, and treatment decisions should carefully incorporate patient factors, including pregnancy and lactation, to ensure safety and efficacy."

        "conceptual_foundation": "After an acute nerve injury such as a stab wound to the ulnar nerve, the muscle fibers begin to show signs of denervation. However, the classical fibrillation potentials that are emblematic of denervation do not typically appear until 10–14 days post-injury. Instead, one of the earliest detectable abnormalities on needle electromyography (EMG) is increased insertional activity, which reflects the instability of the muscle membrane when denervated.",
        "pathophysiology": "Following a nerve injury, Wallerian degeneration ensues distal to the lesion. This process leads to impaired neuromuscular transmission and muscle membrane instability. The increased irritability of these denervated fibers results in abnormal electrical discharges upon insertion of the EMG needle. Fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves, more specific markers of denervation, take time (typically 10–14 days) to develop as the full extent of axonal degeneration becomes evident.",
        "clinical_correlation": "In the setting of a ulnar nerve injury from a stab wound, patients can present with motor deficits (e.g., weakness in ulnar-innervated hand muscles) and sensory disturbances in the ulnar distribution. Early electrodiagnostic studies (around 5 days post-injury) help localize the lesion and estimate the timing of the nerve injury. The presence of increased insertional activity correlates with acute muscle fiber membrane instability secondary to denervation.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "The diagnostic evaluation of acute nerve injuries involves both nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle EMG. While NCS can demonstrate features such as conduction block and reduced compound muscle action potentials, needle EMG is particularly useful in detecting early spontaneous activity. At 5 days post-injury, the key abnormality is increased insertional activity; fibrillation potentials typically emerge after 7–14 days. The differential includes distinguishing between neurapraxia (conduction block without axonal loss) and more severe axonotmesis or neurotmesis.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Ulnar neuropathy is classified by the severity and type of nerve injury: neurapraxia (a transient conduction block with no axonal damage), axonotmesis (axonal damage with preservation of the connective tissue framework), or neurotmesis (complete disruption of the nerve). The electrodiagnostic findings combined with the clinical history and examination help classify the injury, which is important for prognosis and management.",
        "management_principles": "Management of acute ulnar neuropathy depends on the severity of the injury. Conservative management, including observation and physical therapy, may be appropriate for neurapraxia, while surgical intervention is considered in cases of axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Pregnancy and lactation considerations are critical; when surgical intervention is necessary, one should use anesthetic and surgical medications that are safe in pregnancy and lactation. In addition, non-teratogenic agents should be chosen and multidisciplinary consultation may be warranted to balance maternal and fetal risks.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (Decrease in recruitment) refers to a reduction of motor unit activation on voluntary effort and is less sensitive in the early phase of denervation. Option B (Fibrillations) indeed represents classic signs of denervation but generally are not seen until around 10–14 days after the injury, making them less likely at 5 days. Option D (Complex repetitive discharges) are typically associated with chronic changes or reinnervation phenomena. Option C (Insertional activity) is the early abnormal finding on needle EMG attributable to increased muscle fiber irritability shortly after denervation, making it the correct answer.",
        "clinical_pearls": "Timing is crucial when interpreting electrodiagnostic studies in nerve injuries. Fibrillation potentials are a late sign (typically emerging after 1–2 weeks), whereas increased insertional activity is one of the earliest indicators of denervation. Recognizing the timeline of these findings is essential for accurate diagnosis.",
        "current_evidence": "Recent neuromuscular and electrodiagnostic literature confirms that the earliest EMG abnormality in acute nerve injury, such as an ulnar neuropathy secondary to a stab wound, is increased insertional activity. This evidence underscores the importance of performing serial studies if initial exams are inconclusive, particularly in the context of early post-trauma evaluation."

Unlike epileptic or cortical myoclonus (where discrete electrophysiologic abnormalities and often EEG correlates are noted), essential myoclonus lacks any structural lesion and is presumed to be due to a dysfunction in motor regulation. Although not as well characterized as essential tremor, some patients report improvement with alcohol, which is believed to temporarily modulate GABA‐ergic tone.",
        "clinical_correlation": "Patients typically present with isolated myoclonic jerks that may be action-induced or present at rest. A notable clinical feature is the improvement of symptoms with the intake of alcohol, which also serves as a supportive clue in the diagnosis. Importantly, these patients do not exhibit other neurological deficits, and their workup (including imaging and routine EEG) is usually unremarkable.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "Workup generally includes a thorough clinical examination, neurophysiological studies such as EMG (which can help differentiate among different types of myoclonus), and sometimes EEG for ruling out epileptic phenomena. Differential diagnoses include cortical or epileptic myoclonus (which are associated with abnormal EEG changes), physiological myoclonus (a normal variant seen in sleep or benign fasciculations), and secondary causes of myoclonus (such as metabolic or toxic states).",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Myoclonus can be classified by its clinical presentation (focal, multifocal, or generalized) and by its anatomical origin (cortical, subcortical/brainstem, spinal, or peripheral). The label 'essential' is used for idiopathic cases in which no other neurological signs or structural abnormalities can be identified.",
        "management_principles": "Management is largely symptomatic. First-line treatment options include medications such as clonazepam, valproate, or levetiracetam. Since alcohol may transiently improve symptoms, its effect supports the diagnosis but alcohol is not recommended as a treatment strategy. In women who are pregnant or lactating, benzodiazepines and levetiracetam may be used with caution after weighing the risks and benefits, whereas valproate is generally contraindicated due to its teratogenicity.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (Cortical myoclonus) typically implies an epileptic or neurodegenerative process with characteristic EEG findings, which is not the case here. Option C (Physiological myoclonus) represents normal, benign phenomena (e.g., sleep or hiccups) that are transient and do not present as a persistent syndrome. Option D (Epileptic myoclonus) would be accompanied by other seizure-related phenomena and abnormal EEG discharges. Thus, Option B (Essential myoclonus) fits best given the isolated, alcohol-responsive nature of the myoclonic jerks.",
        "clinical_pearls": "1. Alcohol responsiveness is a key supportive feature in disorders falling under the 'essential' category (as seen in essential tremor and, less commonly, essential myoclonus). 2. Differentiating between cortical/epileptic myoclonus and essential myoclonus is crucial; the absence of EEG abnormalities and other neurological signs points toward an essential, idiopathic process.",
        "current_evidence": "Recent research emphasizes the role of dysfunctional inhibitory neurotransmission in idiopathic movement disorders. While essential tremor is much better characterized in clinical studies, evolving neurophysiological techniques continue to refine our understanding of less common presentations such as essential myoclonus. Guidelines still recommend symptomatic therapy with agents that enhance GABAergic transmission with special consideration for women of childbearing potential."

        "conceptual_foundation": "In patients with acute ischemic stroke, treatment is usually time sensitive. However, in the context of infective endocarditis, which is a well-known source of septic emboli, the management approach differs considerably compared to atherosclerotic strokes.",
        "pathophysiology": "Infective endocarditis, particularly in IV drug users, predisposes to the formation of infected vegetations on heart valves. Embolization of these vegetations can lead to ischemic strokes. Unlike typical thromboembolic strokes from atherosclerosis or cardiac mural thrombi, septic emboli carry a risk of causing hemorrhagic conversion and mycotic aneurysms.",
        "clinical_correlation": "The patient’s history of intravenous drug use, the presence of fever, and a pan‐systolic murmur strongly point towards infective endocarditis as the underlying etiology of the stroke. In such cases, rapid identification and treatment of the infection are paramount to prevent further embolic events and complications.",
        "diagnostic_approach": "The diagnostic workup in such cases includes blood cultures, echocardiography (transthoracic and/or transesophageal) to identify vegetations on the valves, as well as neuroimaging (CT or MRI) to assess the nature of the stroke. Differential diagnoses include atherosclerotic stroke, cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation, or hemorrhagic stroke. The clinical context and imaging help distinguish septic embolism secondary to endocarditis from these other types.",
        "classification_and_nosology": "Stroke secondary to infective endocarditis is classified as an embolic stroke. It falls into the category of cardioembolic strokes but is unique due to its septic source, which contributes additional risks like hemorrhage.",
        "management_principles": "The primary treatment is the initiation of appropriate intravenous antibiotics tailored to the suspected or identified organism (often covering Staphylococcus aureus in IV drug users). Thrombolysis is contraindicated in infective endocarditis due to the high risk of intracranial hemorrhage and potential worsening of the septic embolic phenomenon. In cases of large vessel occlusion where mechanical thrombectomy is considered, careful evaluation is needed and generally, thrombectomy is not the first-line treatment if an infection is present. In pregnant or lactating patients, antibiotic selection should consider fetal safety, with agents such as penicillins or cephalosporins often preferred.",
        "option_analysis": "Option A (antibiotics) is the appropriate treatment given the clinical scenario of presumed infective endocarditis causing septic emboli. Option B (thrombolysis) is contraindicated in the setting of infective endocarditis. Option C (thrombectomy) is not routinely indicated in septic embolic strokes because of the risk of infecting the cerebral vasculature and provoking hemorrhage. Option D is missing and thus not applicable.",
        "clinical_pearls": "1. In a febrile patient with IV drug use and a new murmur, always suspect infective endocarditis as a source of embolic stroke. 2. Thrombolysis is contraindicated in infective endocarditis because of the increased risk of hemorrhagic conversion.",
        "current_evidence": "Recent guidelines emphasize the need for rapid antibiotic administration in infective endocarditis and caution against the use of thrombolytic therapy in septic embolic strokes due to bleeding risks. Research continues to refine the management strategies in these complex patients, particularly regarding the timing of surgical interventions if indicated."
