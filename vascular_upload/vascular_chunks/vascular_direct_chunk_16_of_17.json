    "explanation": "Embolic strokes, especially in the elderly, often arise from a cardioembolic source such as atrial fibrillation. Recognizing the stroke mechanism is crucial, as management strategies differ substantially from those for atherothrombotic strokes. In embolic strokes, a clot (often formed in the heart due to conditions like atrial fibrillation or from a cardiac thrombus) dislodges and travels to the cerebral circulation, causing sudden arterial occlusion and ischemia. This process typically leads to infarction in a vascular territory distant from the primary lesion. Patients with cardioembolic strokes usually present with sudden-onset neurological deficits (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia) that can be more severe compared to lacunar strokes. Identifying the embolic source is important, as recurrent embolic events are common without appropriate intervention. Workup includes brain imaging (CT or MRI), cardiac evaluation (ECG, Holter monitoring, echocardiography), and assessment of stroke risk factors. Differential diagnoses include atherothrombotic stroke, lacunar infarcts from small vessel disease, and hemorrhagic stroke. Cardiac investigations help confirm the embolic source. For secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke, anticoagulation is the cornerstone of therapy. Options include warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), with DOACs increasingly preferred in non-valvular atrial fibrillation due to better safety profiles. In pregnancy, warfarin is contraindicated and low molecular weight heparin is preferred. For lactating mothers, warfarin is generally considered safe, but each case should be evaluated individually. The decision to start anticoagulation should follow confirmation of the embolic source to reduce recurrent stroke risk. Option A is correct because initiating anticoagulation directly addresses the thromboembolic source, significantly reducing the risk of recurrent strokes. Options that suggest antiplatelet therapy alone or no treatment are inadequate in preventing further embolic events, as antiplatelets do not provide sufficient protection in cardioembolic stroke. \u2022 Always evaluate for atrial fibrillation in patients with embolic stroke as it is a common and treatable source. \u2022 Anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke recurrence by approximately 60-70% in cardioembolic stroke. \u2022 DOACs have largely supplanted warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation due to their favorable safety profile. Recent guidelines from the American Heart Association and European Stroke Organization support the use of anticoagulation for secondary prevention in cardioembolic strokes, with a growing body of evidence favoring DOACs over warfarin in appropriate patients. Ongoing research continues to optimize treatment strategies in various patient populations, including considerations for pregnancy and lactation.",

    "explanation": "CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary small vessel disease of the brain characterized by migraine (often with aura), recurrent subcortical strokes, and progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia. Its management is predominantly supportive, with emphasis on controlling modifiable vascular risk factors. Mutations in the NOTCH3 gene impair the function of vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to degeneration and thickening of the vessel wall. This results in chronic ischemia, white matter changes, lacunar infarcts, and ultimately, the clinical manifestations of migraine, strokes, and dementia. There is no disease\u2010modifying therapy currently available. Patients typically present with migraine (often with aura), followed by recurrent ischemic strokes and a progressive decline in cognitive function. The history of migraine, stroke, and subsequent vascular dementia in a relatively young patient may suggest CADASIL. Initial evaluation includes a detailed clinical history and brain MRI (which typically shows confluent white matter hyperintensities especially in the anterior temporal lobes). Confirmation is achieved via genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations. Differential diagnoses include other causes of vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis, and other hereditary leukoencephalopathies. There is no curative treatment for CADASIL. Management is centered on controlling modifiable vascular risk factors. First\u2010line recommendations include lifestyle modifications (most importantly, smoking cessation) and blood pressure control. Antiplatelet agents (such as ASA) are sometimes used for secondary stroke prevention, but the evidence in CADASIL is not robust. Anticoagulation is generally avoided due to a higher risk of hemorrhage. In pregnant or lactating patients, careful risk\u2013benefit evaluation of any pharmacotherapy is mandatory, with an emphasis on non\u2010pharmacological risk factor modification. Option A (smoking cessation) is correct because eliminating a modifiable risk factor is paramount in slowing the progression of vascular damage in CADASIL. Option B (anticoagulant/warfarin) is contraindicated as it increases hemorrhagic risks in small vessel arteriopathy. Option C (ASA) is not the first choice given the lack of proven benefit in CADASIL prophylaxis and potential bleeding risks, thus making risk factor modification (i.e. smoking cessation) the preferred approach. 1. CADASIL is a genetic small vessel disease with no specific disease\u2010modifying treatment \u2013 management relies on controlling risk factors. 2. Smoking cessation is critical as smoking exacerbates vascular injury. 3. MRI with anterior temporal lobe involvement is a key radiologic clue to CADASIL. Recent reviews and consensus guidelines emphasize that in genetically mediated small vessel diseases like CADASIL, the most effective strategy is strict risk factor modification rather than relying on antithrombotic therapy. Ongoing research continues to explore potential targeted therapies, but none are currently validated for routine clinical practice.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question revisits the management approach in CADASIL, where the clinical picture includes migraine, stroke, and cognitive decline. With CADASIL being a non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic arteriopathy, the management goal is to reduce additional vascular injury. The underlying NOTCH3 mutation leads to vascular smooth muscle dysfunction which causes progressive damage to the small cerebral vessels. This structural abnormality predisposes patients to ischemic events and white matter lesions. Due to the recurring strokes and associated migraine attacks, patients with CADASIL are prone to worsening disability. Prevention of further vascular damage through modification of risk factors is essential since no disease-specific pharmacological treatment exists. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings (migraine with aura, subcortical strokes, and early dementia) along with radiologic evidence on MRI and confirmed by genetic testing. Differential diagnoses include sporadic ischemic stroke and other hereditary leukoencephalopathies. Since there is no curative treatment, the first-line management involves rigorous modification of vascular risk factors. The cornerstone of treatment is lifestyle modification, with smoking cessation being the most critical. Although antiplatelets like ASA are sometimes used, their role is not clearly established in CADASIL, and anticoagulation is generally contraindicated. Management in pregnancy and lactation similarly emphasizes non-pharmacologic interventions to avoid harm to the fetus or neonate. Option A (smoking cessation) is the correct answer as it directly addresses modifiable risk factors to slow disease progression. Option A is consistent with the principles of CADASIL management. The marked answer was C, but given the context from the previous similar question, risk factor modification (specifically smoking cessation) remains the best intervention. The other options (if contemplating anticoagulation or other pharmacologic interventions) do not have evidence to support their use in the prophylaxis of further vascular events in CADASIL. 1. Risk factor modification is the only proven strategy to potentially slow the progression of CADASIL-related vascular damage. 2. Smoking is particularly detrimental in CADASIL. 3. Traditional thrombolytic or anticoagulant therapies have not proven beneficial in this disorder. The latest research continues to support that in CADASIL, aggressive control of modifiable risk factors \u2013 particularly smoking cessation \u2013 is central to management. No randomized clinical trials favor pharmacologic prophylaxis like anticoagulation in this setting, and current guidelines reflect an emphasis on lifestyle management.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In acute ischemic stroke management, the decision to administer reperfusion therapies such as intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is based on strict eligibility criteria. A history of a recent stroke is a well-recognized contraindication to thrombolysis. IV tPA works by dissolving clots; however, in brain tissue that has already sustained recent ischemic injury, the blood\u2013brain barrier is compromised. Administering tPA under these circumstances significantly increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation, where damaged vessels are prone to bleeding. In the case presented, an 80-year-old man with a stroke history 2 months prior is now having a new stroke within the therapeutic window. Despite a CT scan showing no acute hemorrhage and evidence of an old cortical insult, the recent stroke is a major red flag, making reperfusion therapy (tPA or tPA plus thrombectomy) a dangerous option. Evaluation includes confirming the stroke timing, reviewing the patient\u2019s history for contraindications (like stroke within the past 3 months), and neuroimaging (CT, MRI) to assess for hemorrhage or infarct evolution. Differential diagnoses such as transient ischemic attack (TIA) and hemorrhagic stroke must be considered and appropriately excluded. First-line treatment for eligible acute ischemic stroke patients is IV tPA administered within the appropriate window, potentially followed by thrombectomy if large vessel occlusion is identified. However, in patients with a recent stroke (within the last 3 months), reperfusion therapies are contraindicated due to the heightened risk of bleeding. In such situations, management shifts to supportive care and secondary prevention strategies. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of tPA involves careful consideration of maternal and fetal risks, with current guidelines generally advising against thrombolysis if contraindications are present. Option A (IV tPA) and Option B (IV tPA followed by thrombectomy) are incorrect because recent stroke (< 3 months) is a contraindication to tPA administration. The marked answer, Option C, though not textually described, is interpreted to mean that thrombolytic therapy should be withheld in this situation, making it the correct choice. 1. A stroke within the past 3 months is a contraindication to tPA due to increased hemorrhagic risk. 2. Always review the patient's recent medical history before considering reperfusion therapies. 3. Advanced age alone is not a contraindication, but accompanying recent stroke is critical. Recent guidelines and updated stroke management protocols underscore that a recent stroke (typically within 3 months) is a contraindication for IV tPA due to the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Ongoing studies and clinical audits consistently support excluding patients with recent strokes from reperfusion therapies, even if they present within the otherwise acceptable time window.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Thrombolytic therapy with tPA is indicated in acute ischemic stroke provided that patients meet strict eligibility criteria. One key contraindication is a recent ischemic event, as the risk of hemorrhagic conversion is significantly increased in recently infarcted brain tissue. After an ischemic stroke, the blood\u2013brain barrier is disrupted. Administering tPA in this vulnerable period (usually within 3 months of a previous stroke) can precipitate bleeding into the damaged brain tissue, leading to hemorrhagic transformation and worse clinical outcomes. In the scenario, the patient had a stroke just 2 months ago and is now presenting with a new ischemic event. This recent history significantly raises the risk of hemorrhagic complications if tPA is administered. Recognizing and adhering to this contraindication is crucial for patient safety. A thorough history is vital to determine the timing of previous strokes. Neuroimaging (CT/MRI) is used to rule out current hemorrhage and to assess brain tissue status. The differential diagnosis may include a new ischemic event versus a hemorrhagic transformation of the previous stroke, making accurate history-taking essential. The standard management principles dictate that in patients with a stroke within the past 3 months, tPA should be withheld. Management then focuses on secondary prevention of stroke, optimization of vascular risk factors, and supportive care. In pregnant or lactating patients, the risk\u2013benefit analysis is even more complex, and conservative management is favored in the presence of contraindications. Option A states that a stroke less than 3 months ago is a (relative) contraindication for tPA, which is correct. Option B is vague with reference to exclusion criteria, and Option C (suggesting thrombectomy benefit) is misleading because the contraindication applies primarily to tPA usage. Therefore, Option A is the best answer. 1. Always confirm the time interval since the last stroke; a stroke within 3 months significantly increases tPA-associated hemorrhagic risk. 2. A thorough medical history is paramount in acute stroke management. 3. Thrombolytic therapy contraindications are strictly adhered to in order to minimize risks. The most recent stroke management guidelines (including those from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association) explicitly list recent stroke (within 3 months) as a contraindication for IV tPA. Recent literature continues to validate this exclusion due to the elevated risk of bleeding, and research is ongoing to better stratify risk in these patients.",

    "explanation": "A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without acute infarction. It is a warning sign for an impending stroke and requires prompt evaluation and secondary prevention. TIA is most commonly due to embolic or thrombotic events in a cerebral artery that transiently compromise cerebral blood flow. In patients with diabetes mellitus and other vascular risk factors, small vessel atherosclerosis and embolic phenomena often play a role. The transient occlusion leads to reversible neurological deficits when reperfusion occurs. In this case, a 64\u2010year\u2010old diabetic patient experienced weakness lasting 25 minutes. This classic presentation of a TIA indicates a temporary reduction in blood flow. Recognizing TIA is crucial because of the high subsequent stroke risk. Diagnosis is primarily clinical with supportive imaging. A non-contrast CT scan is used to rule out hemorrhage or completed infarction, while MRI (especially with diffusion-weighted imaging) is more sensitive in detecting acute ischemia. Differential diagnoses include seizure with postictal paresis, migraine aura, or hypoglycemic events. According to current guidelines, for patients with a TIA who are at high risk for stroke (often with an ABCD2 score \u22654), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using aspirin plus clopidogrel is recommended for the short term (typically 21\u201390 days) to reduce recurrent stroke risk. After this period, therapy is usually de-escalated to single antiplatelet therapy. In pregnant or lactating women (if encountered), low-dose aspirin is generally considered acceptable, although clopidogrel is used with caution and only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. Option A (loading with clopidogrel followed by regular aspirin plus clopidogrel) is correct because numerous studies (such as the CHANCE and POINT trials) have shown that early initiation of DAPT in high-risk TIA/minor stroke patients reduces the risk of subsequent stroke. Options that suggest only aspirin monotherapy or no antiplatelet treatment would not address the high risk of recurrence adequately. 1. TIA is a crucial warning sign for stroke, and early intervention can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. 2. In high-risk TIA patients, DAPT should be initiated within 24 hours. 3. Always address modifiable vascular risk factors alongside antiplatelet therapy. Recent trials (CHANCE, POINT) support the use of DAPT in reducing the risk of stroke after a TIA, particularly in the first 21 to 90 days. Guidelines stress the importance of rapid intervention and risk factor modification.",

    "explanation": "Risk stratification after a TIA is commonly done using the ABCD2 score, which estimates the risk of subsequent stroke within 90 days based on factors such as Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of symptoms, and Diabetes. The underlying mechanism involves temporary blockage of a cerebral artery leading to transient symptoms. In patients with multiple risk factors (such as diabetes, hypertension, and significant symptomatology like unilateral weakness), the likelihood of an unstable vascular pathology and subsequent stroke is high. A 65-year-old male with diabetes and hypertension who experienced 18 minutes of left-side weakness would accumulate a high ABCD2 score (Age \u226560 = 1, blood pressure \u2265140 systolic = 1, unilateral weakness = 2, duration >10 minutes = 1, plus diabetes = 1; total = 6). A score of 6 correlates with a high risk of stroke in the next 90 days. Risk assessment in TIA patients involves a detailed history and physical examination combined with imaging studies (CT/MRI) to rule out infarction. Differential diagnoses include transient seizures or syncope. The scoring system (ABCD2) helps differentiate patients at low versus high risk. High-risk TIA patients should be managed urgently with dual antiplatelet therapy along with aggressive control of vascular risk factors. Hospitalization for further work-up, including vascular imaging, may be indicated. While not directly affecting this older male patient, in pregnant or lactating patients, low-dose aspirin is acceptable and other agents are used with caution. Option C, which labels the 90-day stroke risk as 'High', is correct given the patient's risk factors and ABCD2 score of 6. Options indicating low or moderate risk would underestimate the potential for recurrent stroke. 1. An ABCD2 score of 4 or greater indicates high risk for a subsequent stroke. 2. Unilateral weakness gives 2 points and is a strong predictor of stroke risk. 3. Early intervention in high-risk TIA patients is critical to prevent a full-blown stroke. Guidelines consistently recommend rapid evaluation and initiation of DAPT in high-risk TIA patients to reduce the chance of subsequent stroke. Recent studies validate the use of ABCD2 in prognostication.",

    "explanation": "Third nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy can be caused by various etiologies. A key clinical differentiation is whether the pupil is involved because compressive lesions (like aneurysms) typically affect the pupillary fibers. The oculomotor nerve has superficially located parasympathetic fibers that control pupillary constriction. A posterior communicating (PCom) artery aneurysm can compress these fibers, leading to pupil dilation and dysfunction, distinguishing it from ischemic (microvascular) causes that usually spare the pupil. In a young patient presenting with a third nerve palsy that includes pupil involvement, the clinical suspicion for a PCom aneurysm is high, making it a neurosurgical emergency due to the risk of rupture and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Diagnosis involves neuroimaging with CT angiography or MR angiography to identify the aneurysm. Differential diagnoses include diabetic microvascular third nerve palsy (which typically spares the pupil), midbrain infarct, cavernous sinus syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. Immediate neurosurgical referral is required. Management options include endovascular coiling or surgical clipping of the aneurysm. In pregnancy, management becomes more complex, necessitating a balance between maternal and fetal risks, and generally requires a multidisciplinary team including neurosurgery, obstetrics, and anesthesia. Although the options are not explicitly listed, the key concept is that in the setting of a pupil-involving third nerve palsy, a PCom aneurysm is the most likely and critical diagnosis. Alternative choices such as diabetic neuropathy (which spares the pupil), midbrain infarct (which has additional signs), cavernous sinus syndrome, or myasthenia gravis would be incorrect. 1. Pupil involvement in third nerve palsy points to a compressive etiology. 2. A PCom aneurysm is a neurosurgical emergency. 3. Diabetic third nerve palsy rarely involves the pupil. Recent neuroimaging advances have improved early detection of aneurysms. Updated guidelines stress the urgency of neurosurgical evaluation for pupil-involving third nerve palsies to prevent catastrophic hemorrhage.",

    "explanation": "Hemiballismus is a rare movement disorder characterized by violent, involuntary flinging movements of the limbs, typically due to a lesion in the subthalamic nucleus. The subthalamic nucleus plays a key role in modulating motor activity through the basal ganglia circuit. Lesions, most commonly lacunar infarcts due to small vessel disease, disrupt this modulation, resulting in disinhibited, excessive motor output on the contralateral side. An elderly female presenting with sudden abnormal, involuntary movements in the left arm and leg is highly suggestive of a lacunar stroke affecting the right subthalamic nucleus, which produces contralateral hemiballismus. The normal CT initially followed by an abnormal MRI stroke protocol is typical, as small deep infarcts may not be evident on CT. Diagnosis relies on clinical findings of hemiballismus combined with imaging. MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting small lacunar infarcts. Differential diagnoses include other movement disorders such as chorea (often seen in metabolic or neurodegenerative conditions) or seizures. Management focuses on addressing the underlying stroke with antithrombotic therapy and aggressive control of vascular risk factors. Symptomatic treatment for hemiballismus may involve dopamine-depleting agents or neuroleptics if the movements are severe. In patients who are pregnant or lactating, careful selection of medications is essential; many antipsychotics require risk\u2013benefit analysis and close monitoring. Option B (Sub-thalamic) is correct. Lesions in other locations \u2013 midbrain, pons, and medulla \u2013 are not typically associated with hemiballismus. The subthalamic nucleus is the classic site for lacunar infarcts causing this condition. 1. Lacunar infarcts in the subthalamic nucleus can cause contralateral hemiballismus. 2. CT scans may be normal early in the stroke, making MRI the investigation of choice. 3. Rapid recognition is important to initiate appropriate vascular risk management. Recent advances in MRI technology have improved the detection of small, deep infarcts. Current guidelines emphasize aggressive vascular risk factor management and appropriate antithrombotic therapy in patients with lacunar strokes.",

    "explanation": "Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT) is a condition where a clot forms in the brain\u2019s venous sinuses, leading to impaired venous drainage. This contrasts with cerebral vasculitis, which involves an inflammatory destruction of the vessel wall primarily affecting smaller arteries. The clinical distinction is crucial because the management, prognosis, and underlying risk factors differ between these two entities. In CVT, thrombus formation within the cerebral veins or dural sinuses causes increased venous pressure, resulting in cerebral edema, venous infarction, and potentially hemorrhagic transformation due to disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier. In contrast, cerebral vasculitis involves immune-mediated inflammatory damage to blood vessel walls, which can lead to multiple areas of infarction. CVT is often associated with conditions that promote a hypercoagulable state such as pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, infection, or inherited thrombophilia. Patients with CVT typically present with headache (often the most common symptom), seizures, focal neurological deficits, and signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., papilledema). A presentation with acute neurological deficits in a setting that suggests a clotting disorder is more consistent with CVT rather than an insidious inflammatory process as seen in cerebral vasculitis. The gold standard for diagnosing CVT is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or computed tomography venography (CTV). These imaging modalities can reveal the absence of flow in the affected venous sinuses. In contrast, diagnosing cerebral vasculitis may require vessel wall imaging, laboratory markers of inflammation, and sometimes brain biopsy. Differential diagnoses include intracranial hemorrhage, arterial ischemic stroke, and other causes of headache and focal deficits. The first-line treatment for CVT is immediate anticoagulation, typically with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin, even in the presence of small hemorrhagic infarcts. This is followed by a transition to oral anticoagulants for several months based on individual risk. For pregnant patients, LMWH is preferred due to its safety profile. Second-line treatments may include endovascular thrombolysis in refractory cases. In contrast, management of cerebral vasculitis involves high-dose corticosteroids and often immunosuppressive agents. Option A (Cerebral vasculitis) is incorrect because the clinical and imaging features (as implied in the context) lean more towards a thrombotic process than an inflammatory one. Option B (CVT) is the correct diagnosis given the typical presentation and factors associated with venous thrombosis. 1. CVT often presents with a new-onset headache and neurological deficits in a patient with a hypercoagulable state. 2. MRI with MR venography is the diagnostic study of choice. 3. Early anticoagulation is critical, even if there is evidence of hemorrhagic conversion. Recent guidelines from organizations such as the American Heart Association endorse early anticoagulation for CVT and suggest that newer direct oral anticoagulants may have a role in long-term management, though more research is ongoing.

    "explanation": "This question addresses the selection of the appropriate next laboratory investigation in a patient presumably being evaluated for stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The options include tests for dyslipidemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, and CADASIL, each of which is relevant to different underlying etiologies of cerebrovascular disease. Elevated levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are well-established contributors to atherosclerotic plaque formation, leading to an increased risk for ischemic events. Beta 2 glycoprotein antibodies are associated with an autoimmune-induced hypercoagulable state in antiphospholipid syndrome, while mutations in NOTCH3 are linked with CADASIL, a hereditary arteriopathy affecting small vessels. In the evaluation of a patient with suspected ischemic stroke or TIA, assessing traditional cardiovascular risk factors is vital. A lipid panel (cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL) is routinely ordered to evaluate atherosclerotic risk. The patient\u2019s clinical context, which likely includes other vascular risk factors, makes option B the most appropriate next step. The workup for ischemic cerebrovascular events includes neuroimaging along with laboratory tests to determine risk factors. While Beta 2 glycoprotein antibody tests and genetic screening for NOTCH3 are important in select cases (such as when clinical suspicion for antiphospholipid syndrome or CADASIL is high), the lipid panel is generally the first step given its broad applicability and ease of testing. Based on the results of the lipid panel, lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic treatments (e.g., statins) are initiated as first-line therapy in ischemic stroke risk reduction.

Option A (Beta 2 glycoprotein antibody) is specifically used when antiphospholipid syndrome is suspected, and Option C (NOTCH 3) is reserved for cases with a strong family history or clinical suspicion of CADASIL. Option B, the cholesterol panel, is the most appropriate initial test in the absence of specific indicators toward autoimmune or genetic causes. 1. A lipid panel is a cost-effective and essential screening tool in the evaluation of stroke risk factors. 2.

Always consider the patient\u2019s overall clinical picture before ordering specialized tests. Recent stroke prevention guidelines continue to emphasize aggressive management of dyslipidemia as a cornerstone of ischemic stroke prevention. The utility of a lipid profile in guiding therapy is well supported by current evidence.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question revolves around risk stratification in patients with a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The widely used ABCD2 score includes Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of TIA, and Diabetes to predict the short-term risk of stroke following a TIA. A TIA results from transient cerebral ischemia without causing permanent infarction. Factors such as older age, hypertension, diabetes, and clinical features like unilateral weakness contribute to an increased risk of subsequent stroke. In this 62-year-old male with a 12-year history of diabetes, hypertension, and an episode of left-sided weakness lasting 10 minutes, the ABCD2 score is likely high. Studies have shown that patients with high scores can have a 90-day stroke risk of approximately 18%. Assessment involves careful history taking, neurological examination, and calculating the ABCD2 score. Neuroimaging (MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging) is used to rule out infarction. Differential diagnoses include seizure, hypoglycemia, and migraine aura, which are ruled out based on clinical context and imaging findings. Immediate management includes starting antiplatelet therapy (typically aspirin) and instituting risk factor modification such as blood pressure control, glycemic management, and lipid lowering. Patients with high ABCD2 scores should be admitted for urgent evaluation. In pregnant or lactating patients, low-dose aspirin may be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks, but careful monitoring is needed. Option A (Low risk 3%) underestimates the risk given the patient\u2019s multiple risk factors. Option B (High risk 18%) aligns with data from studies correlating a high ABCD2 score with a near 18% risk of stroke within 90 days. Option C (Moderate risk) is too vague and lacks the quantitative specificity provided by current evidence. 1. The ABCD2 score is a quick and useful tool to predict stroke risk after a TIA. 2. Diabetes and hypertension significantly elevate the risk of subsequent stroke. 3. Prompt assessment and intervention can drastically reduce subsequent stroke risk. Recent validation studies of the ABCD2 score support its use in clinical practice to identify patients at high risk for stroke. Updated guidelines emphasize rapid secondary prevention measures in patients with high ABCD2 scores to reduce the incidence of early stroke.",

    "explanation": "This question tests knowledge of the contraindications for administering intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) in acute ischemic stroke. The protocol mandates careful patient selection to avoid complications such as hemorrhage. IV tPA facilitates clot dissolution by activating plasminogen to plasmin. However, in patients with significant thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), the risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, increases because platelets are essential for clot formation and hemostasis. A platelet count below 100,000/\u00b5L is generally considered an absolute contraindication. In this case, the patient presented with acute ischemic stroke symptoms within the therapeutic window (3.5 hours). However, his platelet count was only 45,000/\u00b5L\u2014a clear violation of the protocol. Despite the acceptable time frame, the administration of tPA in the context of severe thrombocytopenia predisposed him to intracranial hemorrhage. Prior to administration of rTPA, a complete blood count (CBC) is mandatory to screen for contraindications such as coagulopathies and thrombocytopenia. Differential considerations for hemorrhagic complications post-tPA include uncontrolled hypertension and underlying coagulopathies, but in this instance, the low platelet count is the primary red flag. According to current guidelines, IV tPA should not be administered in the presence of a platelet count less than 100,000/\u00b5L. The first step in managing acute ischemic stroke is a thorough laboratory evaluation. In cases where contraindications are present, alternative management strategies and supportive care should be pursued. For pregnant patients, while rTPA can be considered if absolutely necessary, the same laboratory contraindications apply, underscoring the universal need for caution. Option A (Low deficit) is not a contraindication to tPA. Option B (Out of TPA window) is incorrect because the patient presented within the accepted time frame. Option C (Platelet count of 45,000) accurately identifies an absolute contraindication to tPA administration according to established protocols. 1. Always verify laboratory values, especially platelet count, before proceeding with rTPA. 2. Thrombocytopenia is an absolute contraindication to thrombolytic therapy. 3. Strict adherence to stroke treatment protocols is essential to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic complications. Updated guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association reinforce that a platelet count below 100,000/\u00b5L is a contraindication to tPA therapy. Ongoing research continues to explore optimal patient selection and novel management strategies for hyperacute stroke care.",

    "explanation": "Acute ischemic stroke treatment centers on rapid reperfusion of the affected brain region. The two main modalities are IV thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. When contraindications to IV thrombolysis exist (for example, due to high bleeding risk or recent surgery), mechanical thrombectomy becomes the preferred modality\u2014especially in patients with large vessel occlusion. In ischemic stroke, an occlusive thrombus blocks cerebral blood flow leading to ischemia and potential infarction. IV thrombolytic agents (e.g., alteplase) dissolve clots through enzymatic degradation. However, when there is an absolute contraindication to thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy uses endovascular devices (like stent retrievers or aspiration catheters) to physically remove the clot, restoring blood flow to salvageable brain tissue. Patients with large vessel occlusions often present with sudden focal deficits. Rapid imaging (noncontrast CT followed by CT angiography) is used to rule out hemorrhage and to locate the occlusion. When IV thrombolysis is contraindicated, timely decision\u2010making to perform mechanical thrombectomy is crucial to improve outcomes. Initial evaluation includes a noncontrast CT scan to exclude hemorrhage and MRI/CT angiography to assess the location and extent of occlusion. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic stroke, stroke mimics (e.g., seizure, migraine), and other ischemic etiologies. Identifying a large vessel occlusion with salvageable penumbra is key to opting for thrombectomy. According to the latest AHA/ASA guidelines, eligible acute ischemic stroke patients should receive IV thrombolysis within 4.5 hours if no contraindications exist. In patients with large vessel occlusion or those contraindicated for IV thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy is recommended, with trials (e.g., DAWN and DEFUSE-3) extending the treatment window up to 24 hours in selected cases. In pregnant or lactating patients, treatment must be individualized\u2014the risks of systemic thrombolysis are weighed against potential benefits, and thrombectomy may be preferred given lower systemic drug exposure. Option A is a statement declaring IV thrombolytics as absolutely contraindicated, which does not represent an active management strategy. Option B (mechanical thrombectomy) is correct because it represents the appropriate management option in a scenario where IV thrombolysis is contraindicated. Option C (IV thrombolysis) would be contraindicated in this context, and Option D (combination therapy) is not applicable since thrombolysis cannot be used. 1. Mechanical thrombectomy has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with large vessel occlusion strokes and contraindications to IV thrombolysis. 2. Rapid imaging and door-to-treatment time are critical for successful reperfusion. 3. In pregnancy, multidisciplinary risk-benefit analysis is essential when considering reperfusion therapy. Recent landmark trials such as DAWN and DEFUSE-3 have expanded the window for mechanical thrombectomy and solidified its role in acute stroke management, particularly in patients with large vessel occlusion. Current guidelines recommend thrombectomy in patients who cannot receive IV thrombolysis due to contraindications.",

    "explanation": "CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary small vessel disease that presents with recurrent strokes, migraine with aura, and cognitive decline. The condition has a strong familial pattern and is confirmed by identifying mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. Mutations in the NOTCH3 gene lead to degeneration and dysfunction of vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in thickened, fibrotic small arteries. This compromises cerebral blood flow, particularly in the subcortical regions, leading to ischemic injury and the characteristic white matter changes seen on MRI. Affected individuals typically present in mid-adulthood with a history of migraine (often with aura), subcortical ischemic strokes, and progressively worsening cognitive impairment. A positive family history (e.g., a parent dying young) heightens suspicion for a genetic etiology like CADASIL. The diagnostic workup includes brain MRI, which commonly shows white matter hyperintensities in the anterior temporal poles and external capsules. However, definitive diagnosis is achieved via genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations. Differential diagnoses include other causes of small vessel disease, demyelinating disorders, and mitochondrial cytopathies. There is no curative treatment for CADASIL; management focuses on controlling vascular risk factors, symptomatic treatment, and secondary stroke prevention. Antiplatelet agents and blood pressure management are often employed. Genetic counseling is recommended. In pregnant or lactating patients, careful blood pressure management is essential and medications should be chosen with safety profiles in mind. The correct answer is genetic testing for the NOTCH3 mutation, as it directly confirms the diagnosis of CADASIL. Echocardiography is more useful when an embolic source is suspected, and testing for antiphospholipid antibodies is pertinent in acquired hypercoagulable states, neither of which aligns with the classic clinical picture of CADASIL. 1. CADASIL should be suspected in young to middle-aged patients with a combination of strokes, migraine with aura, and a positive family history. 2. The anterior temporal lobe white matter lesions on MRI are a helpful radiological clue. 3. There is currently no disease-modifying treatment for CADASIL; management is supportive. Contemporary research continues to focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms in CADASIL with the aim of developing targeted therapies. Meanwhile, management remains symptomatic and preventive, with genetic testing serving as the gold standard for diagnosis.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Intracranial aneurysms are dilations or outpouchings of arterial walls, often occurring at branch points. Aneurysms in the posterior communicating (PCOM) segment are notorious for causing oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsies due to their anatomical proximity. A PCOM aneurysm can enlarge and compress the adjacent oculomotor nerve, which carries parasympathetic fibers responsible for pupil constriction and motor fibers that mediate most extraocular movements. Compression leads to a dilated pupil (mydriasis), ptosis, and impaired ocular movements\u2014especially affecting the medial rectus, which is responsible for adduction. Clinically, patients with a ruptured PCOM aneurysm may present with sudden headache, signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a CN III palsy. The presence of a dilated pupil and impaired adduction in the same eye strongly suggests compression by a nearby aneurysm. Initial evaluation typically includes a noncontrast CT scan to identify hemorrhage and a CT angiogram (or digital subtraction angiography) to localize the aneurysm. Differential diagnoses include other aneurysm locations (such as anterior communicating or middle cerebral arteries), which less commonly produce isolated CN III dysfunction. Management of a ruptured aneurysm generally involves securing the aneurysm via surgical clipping or endovascular coiling to prevent rebleeding. The choice of procedure depends on aneurysm size, neck morphology, and patient-specific factors. In pregnant patients, endovascular coiling is often favored to minimize surgical risks and anesthesia exposure, though the risks of radiation must be addressed through shielding and minimizing exposure. Option A (Right PCOM) is correct, as a PCOM aneurysm is classically associated with CN III palsy, manifesting with a dilated pupil and impaired adduction on the same side. Options B, C, and D refer to aneurysm locations that are less likely to cause the specific pattern of oculomotor dysfunction seen in this patient. 1. A \u2018blown pupil\u2019 (dilated and unresponsive) in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage is highly suggestive of a PCOM aneurysm. 2. Immediate neuroimaging and vascular studies are critical in the management of suspected aneurysmal rupture. 3. Endovascular services have increasingly become the mainstay in managing many cerebral aneurysms. Recent trials and meta-analyses continue to support the efficacy and safety of endovascular coiling for PCOM aneurysms. Updated guidelines advocate for early intervention in ruptured aneurysms to reduce the risk of rebleeding and improve outcomes.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "The cerebral arterial circulation is divided into the anterior and posterior systems. Although the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) normally arises from the basilar artery, a common anatomical variant known as the fetal-type PCA arises directly from the internal carotid artery (ICA). This variant essentially links the PCA directly to the ICA. During fetal development, the PCA originates from the ICA. In many adults, the PCA subsequently shifts its origin to the basilar artery; however, in a significant proportion of individuals, the fetal configuration persists. This means that the PCA\u2014at least in its proximal segment\u2014arises from the ICA, influencing cerebral hemodynamics and collateral circulation patterns. Recognizing vascular variants is important when evaluating stroke patients or planning neurosurgical/endovascular procedures. A fetal origin of the PCA can alter perfusion dynamics, and in cases of ICA occlusion, the ipsilateral PCA may be more directly affected. A detailed vascular imaging study (CT angiography or MR angiography) is used to delineate the circle of Willis architecture and identify variants such as a fetal-type PCA. Differential diagnosis in this context involves verifying the origins of other cerebellar arteries, which typically arise from the vertebrobasilar system. While this anatomical variant does not typically alter immediate management in ischemic stroke beyond diagnostic awareness, it is critical for surgical planning. In pregnant or lactating patients, any imaging that involves radiation must be carefully managed; non-ionizing modalities (like MR angiography) might be preferred when safe and available. Option A (AICA), Option B (PICA), and Option D (SCA) originate from the basilar or vertebral arteries. Option C (PCA) is correct because, in the setting of a fetal-type PCA, it arises from the ICA. Even though the PCA classically comes from the basilar artery in adults, the fetal variant is common and functionally connects the PCA to the ICA. 1. The fetal-type PCA is present in roughly 10%-30% of people and is important in cerebral hemodynamics. 2. Recognizing this variant can help explain unusual stroke patterns in the posterior circulation. 3. Always review the circle of Willis anatomy in advanced neuroimaging assessments. Recent vascular imaging studies continue to highlight the prevalence and clinical significance of the fetal PCA variant. This anatomical insight is increasingly important in planning interventions for stroke patients and in understanding collateral circulation dynamics.",

    "correct_answer": "a",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question tests the recognition of the classic disconnection syndrome known as alexia without agraphia. In this syndrome, the patient loses the ability to read while retaining the ability to write because of a disruption in the transfer of visual information from one hemisphere (typically the intact right occipital cortex) to the language centers in the dominant left hemisphere. The splenium of the corpus callosum is the key conduit for this interhemispheric transfer. Infarction in the region of the splenium (typically in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery) prevents visual information captured by the right occipital lobe from reaching the dominant (usually left) language areas. Although the classic lesion often involves the left occipital lobe plus the splenium, isolated splenial involvement can produce a similar syndrome by disconnecting the intact visual field input from language processing centers. The resulting right homonymous hemianopia reflects involvement of the left visual pathway. The patient\u2019s symptom of right homonymous hemianopia indicates a lesion affecting the left visual pathway, while the preserved ability to write despite the inability to read is a hallmark of alexia without agraphia. The syndrome is attributed to a disconnection between the visual recognition centers in the right occipital region and the left-sided language areas. Neuroimaging is essential. A CT scan can identify infarcts in the posterior circulation territory. Follow\u2010up MRI (especially diffusion\u2010weighted imaging) helps delineate the exact location and extent of the infarction. Differential diagnoses to consider include isolated occipital lobe infarcts (which may impair both reading and writing) and other disconnection syndromes from lesions in the dominant hemisphere. Acute management follows ischemic stroke protocols, including assessment for reperfusion therapies within the therapeutic window (IV thrombolysis, endovascular thrombectomy if indicated by large vessel occlusion). Secondary prevention (antiplatelet therapy, statins, risk factor management) is key. In special populations such as pregnancy or lactation, the decision to use tPA is carefully balanced against risks, but the principles of rapid neuroimaging and reperfusion remain similar when criteria are met. Option a (Splenium of the corpus callosum) is correct because the lesion disrupts the transfer of visual information between hemispheres, producing alexia without agraphia. Option b (Right occipital lobe) is incorrect because a right occipital infarct would cause a left-sided visual deficit. Option c (Left occipital lobe) would typically result in an inability to read and write (due to more extensive involvement of language and visual areas) rather than the selective loss of reading. 1. Alexia without agraphia is a rare disconnection syndrome most often seen with a left occipital and splenial infarct. 2. Preservation of writing despite loss of reading should prompt evaluation for a splenium lesion. Recent stroke guidelines emphasize the importance of rapid imaging (CT/MRI) to localize infarcts and guide reperfusion therapy. Although the classical description involves both the left occipital lobe and splenium, advanced imaging has shown that isolated splenial involvement can suffice to produce the syndrome.",

    "explanation": "This question focuses on the proper application of thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and the importance of adhering to contraindications. A thorough understanding of tPA contraindications is crucial to prevent serious complications such as intracranial hemorrhage. tPA works by promoting fibrinolysis. However, in patients with thrombocytopenia (e.g., a platelet count of 45,000/mm\u00b3), the risk of bleeding is augmented due to impaired hemostasis. This predisposes them to hemorrhagic conversion, including intracranial hemorrhage. In the acute management of AIS, an inappropriately low platelet count (below the recommended threshold of 100,000/mm\u00b3) is an absolute contraindication to tPA administration because it increases hemorrhagic risk. Recognizing and correcting laboratory abnormalities before thrombolysis is essential in clinical practice. Before administering tPA, a careful review of laboratory values including complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile, and imaging to rule out hemorrhage is mandatory. Differentials for bleeding risk include coagulopathies from anticoagulant use or liver dysfunction, which must be ruled out before proceeding with thrombolysis. The first step in the management of AIS is to ascertain eligibility for IV tPA by confirming that all contraindications (including a platelet count <100,000/mm\u00b3) are absent. When contraindications are identified, alternative management strategies such as antiplatelet therapy and supportive care are pursued. In special populations such as pregnant or lactating women, the same lab criteria apply with careful consideration given to the risks and benefits of tPA use. Option a (Out of the tPA window) is incorrect because the patient was within the therapeutic time frame. Option b (Platelet count 45,000) is correct as administering tPA in the presence of significant thrombocytopenia is an established contraindication and likely led to the intracranial hemorrhage. 1. Always review the lab values, especially platelet count, before initiating thrombolytic therapy in AIS. 2. A platelet count below 100,000/mm\u00b3 is an absolute contraindication for tPA, significantly increasing the risk of hemorrhage. The latest American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines underscore the importance of adhering to strict laboratory thresholds to minimize hemorrhagic complications associated with tPA. Ongoing studies continue to evaluate the balance between risk and benefit in borderline cases, but current recommendations remain clear.",

    "explanation": "This question addresses the diagnosis of vertebral artery dissection, a vascular injury that can occur even after minor trauma. Recognizing the clinical cues such as focal neurological deficits in the context of trauma is essential to prompt diagnosis and management. Vertebral artery dissection involves an intimal tear that can lead to the formation of a thrombus, subsequent embolization, or local ischemia in the posterior circulation. Mild trauma, particularly involving the neck, can trigger this process. The resultant ischemia can produce focal deficits such as visual disturbances if the occipital lobe or associated structures are affected. The patient\u2019s complaint of not being able to see the left side of the road, along with a history of a similar prolonged headache (which may hint at a predisposition to vascular issues), is consistent with vertebral artery dissection. The relatively minor trauma described aligns with the known risk factors for this condition. Imaging studies, particularly CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography, are critical for diagnosing vertebral artery dissection. Differential diagnoses include Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), typically associated with acute hypertension and seizures, and Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS), which presents with thunderclap headaches and multifocal arterial narrowing on angiography. The mainstay of treatment for vertebral artery dissection involves antithrombotic therapy (either antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation) to prevent thromboembolic events. Endovascular intervention is reserved for cases where medical management fails or there is significant ongoing ischemia. In pregnant or lactating patients, low molecular weight heparin is generally preferred due to its safety profile. Option a (PRES) is incorrect because PRES is typically associated with severe hypertension, seizures, and encephalopathy rather than isolated visual deficits following mild trauma. Option b (RCVS) is less likely given its hallmark presentation with thunderclap headaches and diffuse vasospasm, not isolated visual symptoms. Option c (Vertebral artery dissection) is correct as it best explains the temporal relationship with trauma and the neurological presentation. 1. Vertebral artery dissection should be considered in patients presenting with posterior circulation symptoms following even minor cervical trauma. 2. CTA is the imaging modality of choice for early detection of arterial dissections. Recent literature and guidelines emphasize prompt recognition of vertebral artery dissection, as early antithrombotic therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke.

    "explanation": "This question examines the management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in a patient with significant contraindications to IV thrombolysis. The scenario highlights how recent medical history, such as a previous stroke, influences treatment decisions. IV thrombolysis (tPA) carries a risk for hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic brain tissue. In patients with a recent stroke\u2014especially within the past three months\u2014the brain may be more vulnerable, increasing the risk of hemorrhage when tPA is administered. This necessitates careful patient selection and strict adherence to guidelines. The patient, a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and a prior stroke 2 months ago, presents with moderate neurological deficits (NIHSS 8). Although she is within the window for reperfusion (3.5 hours), the recent stroke represents a critical contraindication to tPA use, heightening the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. CT and CTA have been appropriately performed to evaluate for large vessel occlusion. In AIS workup, after confirming no hemorrhage on CT and evaluating for large vessel occlusion on CTA, clinicians must review contraindications to tPA. A history of stroke within the last 3 months is a recognized contraindication. Differential considerations might include evaluating whether the previous stroke is old and stable versus recent and unstable, as the risk profiles differ. According to current AHA/ASA guidelines, a previous stroke within the past 3 months is considered an absolute contraindication to IV tPA due to the high risk of hemorrhagic complications. For patients with large vessel occlusion and contraindications to tPA, mechanical thrombectomy is recommended. In settings such as pregnancy or lactation, mechanical thrombectomy remains a therapeutic option when tPA is contraindicated, with appropriate multidisciplinary consultation. Option A is correct because it identifies that IV thrombolysis is contraindicated in this patient (due to the stroke 2 months ago) and that mechanical thrombectomy should be considered as the next line of intervention. Option B (IV thrombolysis alone) and Option C (combination of IV thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy) are incorrect due to the contraindication imposed by the recent stroke. 1. A history of stroke within the past 3 months is a key contraindication to administering IV tPA due to an elevated risk of hemorrhage. 2. Mechanical thrombectomy is the preferred intervention in patients with large vessel occlusion who are ineligible for IV thrombolysis. Recent trials and updated guidelines continue to support mechanical thrombectomy for AIS patients with large vessel occlusion, especially when thrombolytics are contraindicated. Emerging research is focused on expanding treatment windows and refining selection criteria, but the contraindications for IV tPA, such as recent stroke, remain firmly established.",

The cornerstone for eligible patients presenting within 4.5 hours is intravenous thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA), particularly when the stroke severity (e.g., an NIHSS score of 12 indicating moderate deficits) supports active intervention. In ischemic stroke, an artery is occluded by a thrombus or embolus, leading to reduced blood flow, energy failure, and infarction of brain tissue. IV tPA works by dissolving fibrin clots, thereby re-establishing blood flow to preserve the ischemic penumbra. This mechanism is most effective when administered early, before irreversible injury occurs. A patient presenting with a CT brain (to exclude hemorrhage), a moderate NIHSS of 12, and within the therapeutic time window is an ideal candidate for IV tPA.

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with an acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion within 3.5 hours of symptom onset \u2013 a scenario typically managed with reperfusion therapy. In most eligible patients, the standard treatment would be intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 4.5 hours, ideally combined with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for large vessel occlusions (LVO). However, a history of an ischemic stroke only 2 months ago contraindicates the use of IV tPA due to increased hemorrhagic risk. Thus, the core principle is to offer mechanical thrombectomy alone to safely revascularize the occluded territory while avoiding the risks posed by thrombolytics in this setting. In acute ischemic stroke from a large vessel occlusion like the MCA, a thrombus obstructs arterial blood flow resulting in ischemia and infarction of the brain tissue supplied by that vessel. There is an ischemic core of irreversibly damaged tissue surrounded by a penumbra of potentially salvageable brain tissue. Mechanical thrombectomy directly removes the occlusive clot, restoring blood flow and minimizing the extent of infarction. Despite an NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 8, a left MCA occlusion\u2014even with moderate deficits\u2014can result in significant functional impairment, such as language deficits if the dominant hemisphere is involved or motor deficits affecting daily activities. The recent stroke history further limits the safe use of IV tPA, making mechanical thrombectomy the primary intervention. The diagnostic process for acute stroke typically involves obtaining a noncontrast head CT to rule out hemorrhage and a CT angiogram to identify the occlusion. In this case, the left MCA occlusion is confirmed on vascular imaging. Differential diagnoses include intracerebral hemorrhage and stroke mimics, but imaging is decisive in confirming an LVO. The recent stroke history is also ascertained from the patient\u2019s clinical history. Current American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend that for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO who are within the treatment window, IV tPA should be administered if no contraindications exist. However, a recent ischemic stroke (within 3 months) is a relative contraindication to IV tPA because of the increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Therefore, in this patient, mechanical thrombectomy alone is indicated. For pregnant or lactating patients, while IV tPA has been used in selected cases with caution, thrombectomy is generally favored when there is a contraindication to tPA, as it minimizes systemic drug exposure and potential risks. Option A (IV tPA) is contraindicated because of the recent stroke. Option B (IV tPA + MT) similarly exposes the patient to the thrombolytic risk, which is unacceptable in this context. Options C (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy) and D (IV Heparin) are not appropriate for acute revascularization in LVO strokes. The marked answer of 'Mechanical thrombectomy alone' is the only treatment that aligns with guideline-based management for a patient with a recent stroke and confirmatory imaging of a left MCA occlusion. 1. A history of ischemic stroke within the last 3 months is a contraindication to IV tPA because of hemorrhagic risk. 2. Mechanical thrombectomy is effective in removing thrombi in large vessel occlusions, even in patients with moderate NIHSS scores, if the deficits are disabling. 3. In patients with contraindications to thrombolysis, especially in those with recent strokes or other contraindications, MT alone is the preferred method of reperfusion. Landmark trials such as MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, and REVASCAT have demonstrated that mechanical thrombectomy significantly improves outcomes in patients with LVO. Current guidelines endorse MT either in addition to tPA or, in cases where tPA is contraindicated (such as a recent stroke within 3 months), as the sole reperfusion therapy. This evidence supports the marked answer of using mechanical thrombectomy alone in this patient.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Carotid dissection involves a tear in the intimal layer of the internal carotid artery, allowing blood to enter the vessel wall, forming a hematoma that narrows or occludes the lumen. In a young male following an MVA with imaging evidence of ICA occlusion and ischemic infarctions, dissection is the most consistent diagnosis. Traumatic forces during an MVA can cause a tear in the arterial wall (intima) of the ICA. Blood entering the subintimal space creates an intramural hematoma, leading to vessel stenosis or complete occlusion, which in turn causes reduced cerebral perfusion and ischemia. Patients with traumatic dissection generally present with signs of stroke such as focal neurological deficits, headache, or neck pain. In young patients without significant atherosclerotic risk factors, and particularly following trauma, dissection should be high on the differential diagnosis. Key imaging modalities include CT angiography or MR angiography, which can reveal features such as a double lumen, intimal flap, or tapered occlusion. Differential diagnoses include thromboembolism, atherosclerosis, and vasculitis; however, these are less likely in a young post-traumatic scenario. Management typically includes antithrombotic therapy, with either antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants used to prevent thromboembolic complications. Current guidelines recommend careful patient selection. In pregnant or lactating women, low dose aspirin is generally considered safe, while warfarin is contraindicated and low molecular weight heparin can be used with appropriate caution. Endovascular interventions are reserved for cases that do not respond to medical management or where there is clinical deterioration. Option A (Dissection) is the most accurate answer given the clinical scenario. Thromboembolism, while a potential result of dissection, is not the primary diagnosis in this traumatic context; atherosclerosis is unlikely in a young individual, and vasculitis typically presents with systemic findings, making them less appropriate choices. In any young patient presenting with stroke after trauma, carotid dissection should be strongly considered. Rapid imaging is critical for diagnosis, as early initiation of antithrombotic therapy can significantly affect outcomes. Special considerations should be taken in pregnant or lactating patients to ensure both maternal and fetal safety. Recent guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association support the use of either antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy in managing carotid dissection. Emerging research also emphasizes individualized management approaches based on the patient's clinical condition and comorbid status, with a focus on safe therapies during pregnancy and lactation.",
