Evidence from the landmark STOP trial (Adams et al., 1998) demonstrated that regular red blood cell transfusions in children with sickle cell disease and elevated transcranial Doppler velocities reduced the 2-year risk of first stroke by 92% (1.3% vs. 10.7%, P<0.001). Aspirin (A) and Plavix (B) have not been shown to meaningfully reduce primary stroke risk in sickle cell disease, and dual antiplatelet therapy (D) is not indicated for primary prevention in this population. Chronic transfusions lower the proportion of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) to below 30%, correcting anemia and decreasing vascular occlusion, while antiplatelet agents do not address the fundamental hemorheologic abnormalities in sickle cell disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Sickle cell disease is a hemoglobinopathy in which a point mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene leads to HbS polymerization, red cell sickling, chronic hemolysis, and vaso-occlusion. The most feared neurologic complication is ischemic stroke, particularly in children. Elevated transfusion velocities on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) are a validated surrogate marker of cerebrovascular stenosis and stroke risk (Adams et al., 1992). Chronic transfusion therapy aims to suppress endogenous HbS production, reduce hemolytic anemia, and improve blood rheology. It has become the standard of care for primary stroke prevention in high-risk pediatric sickle cell patients.","pathophysiology":"Under deoxygenated conditions, HbS polymerizes, distorting red blood cells into a sickle shape that adheres to endothelium, induces inflammation, and triggers vessel occlusion. Repeated episodes of vaso-occlusion lead to endothelial injury, smooth muscle proliferation, and progressive intracranial arterial stenosis, particularly of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Chronic transfusions replenish normal adult hemoglobin (HbA), dilute HbS, reduce hemolysis, and decrease blood viscosity, interrupting the vicious cycle of endothelial injury and occlusion that precipitates stroke.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with sickle cell disease frequently develop silent cerebral infarcts on MRI, detectable in up to 27% by age 6. Overt ischemic strokes occur in 7\u201310% of untreated high-risk patients. Presenting symptoms include acute hemiparesis, aphasia, visual field deficits, and seizures. Without intervention, recurrent infarction and progressive cognitive decline are common. Screening with annual TCD begins at age 2, identifying those with velocities >200 cm/s who derive the greatest benefit from transfusion therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Annual TCD is recommended by AHA/ASA (2014) for children aged 2\u201316 years with sickle cell disease to stratify stroke risk (Class I, Level A). Patients with velocities \u2265200 cm/s should be evaluated with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to confirm stenosis, and chronic transfusion initiated. Iron overload from transfusions necessitates periodic ferritin monitoring and consideration of chelation therapy, guided by serial MRI T2* or serum ferritin levels.","management_principles":"Chronic transfusion aims to maintain HbS <30% and total hemoglobin ~10 g/dL. The STOP 2 trial (2005) showed that discontinuation of transfusion leads to rebound stroke risk, supporting indefinite therapy. Iron chelation with deferasirox or deferoxamine is indicated when ferritin exceeds 1000 ng/mL or liver iron concentration rises. Hydroxyurea is being studied as a potential alternative but is not yet standard for primary stroke prevention.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up includes quarterly TCD to monitor velocities, monthly hemoglobin and reticulocyte counts, and biannual MRI/MRA for silent infarct surveillance.

In cases of ischemic stroke, especially those presenting with borderzone infarcts, CTA can assess for significant carotid stenosis or occlusion, which are common causes of hemodynamic insufficiency leading to infarction in this territory. CTA allows for the quantification of stenosis severity and can also help identify other vascular pathologies such as tandem lesions (simultaneous stenosis at two locations) that could contribute to the ischemic event.","conceptual_foundation":"A deep borderzone infarction occurs in an area of the brain that lies between the territories of two major cerebral arteries, typically between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries (ACA and MCA). This region is particularly susceptible to ischemia due to its location at the farthest reaches of arterial supply, making it vulnerable to hemodynamic changes. \n\nThe term \"borderzone\" refers to areas that receive blood supply from two major arteries, and when there is compromised blood flow due to stenosis or occlusion in the supplying arteries, these areas are at risk for infarction. The deep borderzone is specifically associated with the watershed areas in the deeper structures of the brain, which are less perfused compared to the more centralized areas supplied directly by the main arteries.\n\n### 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiology of a left ICA deep borderzone infarction primarily involves hemodynamic insufficiency. When there is significant stenosis (>50%) or occlusion of the ICA, the blood flow to the corresponding brain regions decreases. This reduced perfusion can lead to ischemia and ultimately infarction in the brain tissue supplied by the affected artery.\n\nIn a normal scenario, collateral circulation may help maintain blood flow to these borderzone areas; however, if collateral pathways are inadequate or if there is a sudden drop in systemic blood pressure, the vulnerable borderzone regions may not receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients, leading to cell death and infarction. The ischemic cascade that follows involves excitotoxicity, inflammation, and apoptosis, further contributing to brain injury.\n\n### 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nPatients with a left ICA deep borderzone infarction may present with various neurological deficits. Common clinical manifestations can include:\n\n- Contralateral Weakness: Patients may exhibit weakness or hemiparesis on the right side of the body (due to the left hemisphere being affected).\n- Sensory Loss: There may be loss of sensation on the right side, correlating with the affected brain regions.\n- Cognitive Impairment: Depending on the extent of the infarction, patients might experience difficulties with executive functions, attention, and memory.\n- Visual Field Deficits: If the infarction impacts areas associated with vision, patients may exhibit visual field cuts (e.g., homonymous hemianopsia).\n\nSymptoms may develop suddenly, consistent with the acute nature of ischemic strokes, and can vary widely based on the specific brain areas involved and the extent of infarction.\n\n### 5.

For patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis of the MCA, aggressive medical management with DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel for 90 days) plus high-intensity statin therapy and blood pressure control has been shown to reduce recurrent stroke risk more effectively than stenting or monotherapy. The SAMMPRIS trial (Chimowitz et al. NEJM 2011;365:993\u20131003) demonstrated a 90-day stroke and death rate of 5.8 % in the medical\u2010management arm versus 14.7 % in the stenting arm (hazard ratio 0.39; 95 % CI 0.18\u20130.81; p=0.013). Clopidogrel monotherapy or aspirin alone in the context of severe stenosis carries higher recurrent event rates (WASID trial, N Engl J Med 2005;352:836\u201345). Stenting is associated with high periprocedural risk (factual error in choosing stenting). Monotherapy with aspirin lacks the early synergistic benefit seen with DAPT (lower platelet aggregation). There is no indication for anticoagulation unless another cardiac source of embolism is present.","conceptual_foundation":"Symptomatic intracranial stenosis of the MCA is classified under ICD-11 8B21.2 as intracranial large artery atherosclerotic disease. The pathogenesis involves atherosclerotic plaque formation in the M1 segment, leading to artery-to-artery embolism or hemodynamic compromise. Differential diagnoses include non\u2010atherosclerotic vasculopathies (vasculitis, Moyamoya disease), dissection, and cardioembolism. Historically, intracranial stenting was explored after carotid stenting success; however, RCT data shifted practice toward medical therapy. The lesion lies within the circle of Willis territory, supplied by MCA penetrating branches; perfusion deficits manifest in the lateral cerebral hemisphere. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking. No significant embryologic variant alters M1 susceptibility.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology\u2014laminar flow through the MCA provides perfusion to lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Atherosclerotic plaque causes luminal narrowing, turbulent flow, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet activation. Over time, intimal lipid deposition, smooth muscle proliferation, and cap rupture lead to in situ thrombosis or distal embolization. Collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomoses may compensate until critical stenosis (>70 %) is reached. DAPT mitigates platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting COX-1 (aspirin) and P2Y12 receptor (clopidogrel), reducing microthrombus formation at the plaque surface. Unlike anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy targets arterial thrombosis pathways. Inflammation via macrophage cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) perpetuates plaque instability, which is not directly addressed by antiplatelet monotherapy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with TIAs or minor strokes\u2014transient hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, or aphasia depending on dominant hemisphere involvement. Recurrent events often occur in the first 90 days after the index event. Natural history without aggressive therapy: ~20 % risk of recurrent stroke within one year (SAMMPRIS medical arm 19 % at one year). Subtypes include borderzone hypoperfusion events (crescendo TIAs) versus embolic cortical strokes. Complete MCA occlusion can lead to massive infarcts, but high-grade stenosis presents with fluctuating deficits. Elderly and hypertensive patients are at higher risk. No prodrome specific to intracranial stenosis beyond TIAs.","diagnostic_approach":"Noninvasive imaging with CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) to identify \u226570 % luminal narrowing (sensitivity 83 %, specificity 93 % for CTA). Transcranial Doppler can screen for high velocities (mean flow velocity >120 cm/s suggestive). Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard (sensitivity/specificity ~98 %). First-tier: CTA/MRA immediately after stroke stabilizes to confirm stenosis. Second-tier: TCD for monitoring and DSA if endovascular intervention considered. Perfusion imaging (CT or MR perfusion) assesses hemodynamic compromise. Pretest probability based on neurologic exam and vascular risk factors should guide imaging. In resource-limited settings, TCD plus noncontrast CT may suffice for initial assessment.","management_principles":"First-tier: DAPT with aspirin 81 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 90 days (Class I, Level A; AHA/ASA 2014 guidelines).

Second-tier: consider cilostazol in Asian populations (based on CSPS trial). Third-tier: stenting only if recurrent events despite optimal medical therapy and anatomy suitable (Wingspan stent). Lifestyle: smoking cessation, diet, exercise. No role for warfarin or DOAC in isolated intracranial stenosis without atrial source.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up at 30, 90, and 180 days to monitor recurrent events.

Rapid identification of vessel status guides reperfusion strategies. CTA provides high-resolution images of arterial anatomy, identifying LVOs and tandem lesions. Seizures can occur at stroke onset, particularly in cortical strokes, but do not preclude imaging or reperfusion. Acute stroke protocols integrate noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, followed by CTA to plan therapy.","pathophysiology":"Ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion causing energy failure, cytotoxic edema, and eventual infarction. In the occipital cortex, infarction disrupts the primary visual pathway, leading to cortical blindness or visual hallucinations (release phenomena). Seizure activity may arise from acute cortical irritation. CTA visualizes the occlusion site and collateral circulation, informing potential thrombectomy decisions.

Historically, classification evolved from empirical nomenclatures to the Calabrese and Mallek criteria (1988) requiring both clinical and histological evidence. Pathological specimens show transmural lymphocytic infiltrates, granulomas, and fibrinoid necrosis. Definitive diagnosis informs aggressive immunosuppression.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral small vessels maintain autoregulation via endothelial nitric oxide and prostacyclin. In CNS vasculitis, T\u2010cell\u2013mediated immune responses target vessel walls, causing endothelial damage, fibrinoid necrosis, luminal narrowing, and ischemia. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) amplify vascular injury. Over time, vessel obliteration leads to multifocal infarcts. Unlike RCVS, there is no reversible vasoconstriction but permanent vessel wall destruction.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is insidious over weeks to months with headache (70%), cognitive decline (60%), focal deficits (50%), and seizures (30%). CSF often shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (<50 cells/\u00b5L) and protein elevation (50\u2013100 mg/dL). MRI reveals multifocal hyperintense T2 lesions, often enhancing.

Antiplatelet therapy alone is insufficient; warfarin requires frequent INR monitoring and carries more bleeding.","conceptual_foundation":"Atrial flutter is classified as a high\u2010risk supraventricular tachyarrhythmia in ICD-11 EA27.0. The sustained rapid atrial rate leads to stasis in the left atrial appendage, predisposing to thrombus formation. Differential includes paroxysmal AF and atrial tachycardia. Echo being normal indicates no thrombus visible but does not eliminate microscopic clot risk. Historical anticoagulation began with warfarin; landmark DOAC trials extended to AFL populations.","pathophysiology":"In atrial flutter, the reentrant circuit in the right atrium produces organized atrial activity at ~300 bpm, with variable ventricular response. Blood stagnation in the left atrium fosters thrombogenesis via Virchow\u2019s triad\u2014hypercoagulability, stasis, endothelial dysfunction. Factor Xa inhibitors directly block the active site of Xa, preventing prothrombin conversion to thrombin. This reduces fibrin clot formation with predictable pharmacokinetics and no need for monitoring.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients may present with palpitations, exertional dyspnea, or be asymptomatic and diagnosed on routine ECG.

Randomized trials (e.g., CLOTS 3) and meta\u2010analyses show that early pharmacologic prophylaxis reduces DVT incidence by ~60% without significantly increasing rebleeding risk (relative risk for VTE 0.68; 95% CI 0.53\u20130.87). External ventricular drain (EVD) placement (option B) is reserved for patients with obstructive hydrocephalus or elevated intracranial pressure; it is not indicated in small basal ganglia or thalamic hemorrhages that remain clinically stable.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is classified by location (lobar, deep, brainstem, cerebellar) and etiology (hypertensive vasculopathy, amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformations). Thalamic hemorrhages are deep ICHs often linked to chronic hypertension or small vessel lipohyalinosis. Management guidelines from AHA/ASA (2015) recommend early DVT prophylaxis in ICH patients who are stable, defining small hemorrhages as <10 mL in volume without mass effect or hydrocephalus. Mechanical prophylaxis (sequential compression devices) alone is less effective than combined pharmacologic and mechanical approaches.","pathophysiology":"ICH causes direct tissue injury, perihematomal edema, and a local inflammatory response driven by erythrocyte breakdown products. Immobilization post\u2010ICH leads to venous stasis, hypercoagulability (elevated fibrinogen and factor VIII), and endothelial dysfunction, increasing the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism. LMWH enhances antithrombin\u2019s inhibition of factor Xa, preventing clot propagation. Initiating LMWH too early (<24 hours) may risk hematoma expansion, but starting at 24\u201348 hours in stable patients balances thrombosis prevention against bleeding risk.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with small thalamic hemorrhages present with contralateral hemisensory deficits (~80%), subtle motor weakness (~60%), and may have mild headaches. Level of consciousness is often preserved. Without hydrocephalus, signs of raised intracranial pressure (vomiting, severe headache, pupil changes) are absent. DVT risk manifests as calf swelling, pain, or asymptomatic thrombi detected on ultrasound in up to 20% of immobilized stroke patients without prophylaxis.","diagnostic_approach":"Non\u2010contrast CT confirms hemorrhage location and volume; typical volumes for small thalamic hemorrhages are <10 mL. CT angiography rules out underlying vascular malformations. Duplex ultrasound of lower extremities is used if clinical suspicion for DVT arises but is not routinely performed when prophylaxis is given. Neuromonitoring in the acute setting includes frequent neurologic checks to ensure hematoma stability before initiating LMWH.","management_principles":"Immediate management includes blood pressure control (target systolic <140 mmHg per INTERACT 2), reversal of coagulopathy, and supportive care. After confirming hematoma stability at 24\u201348 hours, initiate LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily) plus mechanical compression. Neurosurgical intervention is not indicated for small, deep hemorrhages without hydrocephalus. Early mobilization is encouraged as tolerated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat CT at 24 hours to confirm no hematoma expansion. Monitor for signs of DVT and rebleeding.

This makes her an ideal candidate for thrombolysis, aligning with current stroke management guidelines that advocate for rapid intervention to restore cerebral blood flow and minimize neurological damage.\n\nOption A: Labetalol\n\nWhile labetalol can be used to manage hypertension, it is not the immediate step in this scenario. The patient's blood pressure, although elevated, does not exceed the threshold that would necessitate treatment before administering tPA. The focus in the acute setting is to treat the stroke rather than secondary complications of hypertension, assuming the patient\u2019s blood pressure remains manageable.\n\nOption C: Thrombectomy\n\nThrombectomy is recommended for patients with large vessel occlusions, typically identified through advanced imaging techniques such as CT angiography or MR angiography. In this scenario, the patient has not undergone such imaging, and the brain CT does not indicate the presence of a large vessel occlusion that would warrant this intervention. While thrombectomy is a crucial component of stroke management, it would be considered after assessing the vascular status and in cases where thrombolysis is either contraindicated or ineffective.\n\n###","conceptual_foundation":"The management of acute ischemic stroke revolves around the timely restoration of cerebral blood flow to salvage brain tissue and prevent irreversible damage. The cornerstone of acute treatment is thrombolysis with tPA, which acts by dissolving the clot obstructing the cerebral artery. This restoration of blood flow can significantly improve outcomes in terms of functional recovery and survival rates.\n\nThe NIHSS score is an important clinical tool used to quantify the severity of stroke symptoms and guide treatment decisions. An NIHSS score of 20 indicates significant neurological impairment, highlighting the urgency of intervention.\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend thrombolysis within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset, depending on specific criteria and patient characteristics. The use of imaging to rule out hemorrhagic stroke is critical before proceeding with thrombolytics due to the risk of exacerbating bleeding in the brain.\n\n###","pathophysiology":"Acute ischemic stroke occurs when blood supply to a region of the brain is interrupted, leading to a cascade of pathological events. Neurons and glial cells begin to undergo metabolic failure due to the lack of oxygen and glucose. This process can lead to cell death through necrosis or apoptosis, with the penumbra representing the surrounding tissue at risk but not yet irreversibly damaged.\n\nThe initial insult triggers several pathophysiological mechanisms, including excitotoxicity from excess neurotransmitters (especially glutamate), oxidative stress from free radicals, and inflammation. The early ischemic changes seen on CT reflect these processes, including cytotoxic edema and the beginning of tissue necrosis, which can be detected even before significant hypodensity appears.\n\n###","clinical_manifestation":"The clinical presentation of acute ischemic stroke can vary widely depending on the affected brain region. Common signs and symptoms include:\n\n- Sudden onset of weakness or numbness, particularly on one side of the body (hemiparesis).\n- Difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia).\n- Visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision.\n- Loss of coordination or balance.\n\nIn this case, the patient presents with a significant NIHSS score of 20, indicating she likely exhibits severe motor and possibly sensory deficits, along with potential speech difficulties and loss of coordination.\n\n###","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic workup for suspected stroke includes:\n\n1. Non-Contrast CT Scan: This initial imaging modality is critical in ruling out hemorrhagic stroke and identifying early ischemic changes.\n2. CT Angiography or MR Angiography: These imaging studies may be performed to evaluate for large vessel occlusions that could indicate a need for thrombectomy.\n3. Laboratory Tests: Basic labs may include glucose levels, complete blood count, and coagulation studies.\n\nEarly recognition of stroke symptoms and quick diagnostic evaluation are essential to ensure timely management. Differential diagnoses can include transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), intracerebral hemorrhage, or other neurological conditions presenting with similar symptoms.\n\n###","management_principles":"The management of acute ischemic stroke can be broken down into several key principles:\n\n- Thrombolysis with tPA: Administered within the therapeutic window, tPA is indicated for eligible patients to dissolve the occluding thrombus.\n- Blood Pressure Management: While acute hypertension is common in stroke patients, it should only be treated if it exceeds the threshold for tPA administration or is causing significant complications.\n- Post-Management Care: After thrombolysis, patients require close monitoring for potential complications, including hemorrhagic transformation or neurological deterioration.\n\nIn this scenario, the next best step is to initiate thrombolysis after confirming eligibility.\n\n###","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitoring and follow-up are crucial in the management of stroke patients:\n\n1. Neurological Monitoring: Continuous assessment of neurological status to detect any deterioration or complications.\n2. Blood Pressure Control: Regular monitoring of blood pressure, particularly in the first 24 hours post-tPA.\n3. Rehabilitation Services: Early involvement of rehabilitation services is important for optimizing recovery.\n\nPrognosis after thrombolysis can vary significantly based on the extent of the initial stroke, the presence of comorbid conditions, and the timeliness of intervention.\n\n###","clinical_pearls":"- \"Time is Brain\": The mantra emphasizes the importance of rapid intervention in stroke management, as every minute lost can lead to significant neuronal loss.\n- NIHSS Score: Understanding the implications of the NIHSS score can guide treatment decisions and predict outcomes.\n- Blood Pressure Thresholds: Remember the critical thresholds for tPA administration (185/110 mm Hg); patients must be treated within strict guidelines to avoid complications.\n\n###","references":"- American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.

Her blood pressure (180/100 mm Hg) is below the 185/110 threshold; therefore, no immediate antihypertensive intervention is required before tPA. Mechanical thrombectomy (Option C) is indicated for large vessel occlusions on vascular imaging, but the first step in the absence of contraindications is IV alteplase.

This is primarily due to the pathophysiological effects of the disease on the vasculature of the central nervous system. In TBM, the inflammation and exudates resulting from the infection preferentially encase the vessels at the base of the brain, with a significant impact on the MCA and its perforating branches. This results in a higher likelihood of ischemic events, such as infarcts, in the MCA territory, which correlates with the specific focal neurological deficits observed in patients.","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberculosis, primarily caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can manifest in various forms, including pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB, the latter including tuberculous meningitis. TBM occurs when the bacilli invade the central nervous system, leading to the development of meningeal inflammation and exudates. \n\nUnderstanding the anatomy of the cerebral circulation is crucial in appreciating why the MCA is most affected. The MCA is a major branch of the internal carotid artery and supplies a large portion of the lateral cerebral hemisphere. Its extensive vascular territory includes critical functional areas responsible for motor control and sensory processing, making its involvement in TBM clinically significant.\n\nIn terms of pathophysiology, TBM leads to an inflammatory response characterized by the accumulation of lymphocytes, macrophages, and the formation of granulomas. This response can lead to vasculitis, resulting in the encasement and inflammation of the MCA and its branches.\n\n## 3.

Common clinical manifestations include:\n\n- Fever: Persistent fever is a common early sign of TBM and is often accompanied by chills and night sweats.\n\n- Headache: Severe, recurrent headaches are frequent and can be debilitating.\n\n- Meningeal Signs: Classic signs of meningeal irritation, such as nuchal rigidity (stiff neck), photophobia (sensitivity to light), and Kernig\u2019s sign, may be present.\n\n- Altered Mental Status: Patients can exhibit confusion, lethargy, or even coma, especially as the disease progresses.\n\n- Neurological Deficits: Focal neurological deficits may arise due to ischemic changes in the brain, particularly in the territory of the MCA. These may include weakness or sensory loss in specific limbs or facial asymmetry.\n\n- Seizures: Seizures can occur due to cortical irritation from inflammation or from the presence of infarcts.\n\nRecognizing these clinical manifestations is crucial for timely diagnosis and management.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis involves a combination of clinical assessment, imaging, and laboratory tests:\n\n- Clinical Evaluation: A thorough history and physical examination focusing on the neurological examination are vital.\n\n- Lumbar Puncture (LP): The gold standard for diagnosing TBM is analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF findings in TBM typically show:\n  - Elevated protein levels\n  - Low glucose levels (hypoglycorrhachia)\n  - Lymphocytic pleocytosis (increased white blood cells with a predominance of lymphocytes)\n\n- Microbiological Testing: Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears and cultures can be performed on CSF, although they may take time to yield results. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for M. tuberculosis DNA can provide faster results.\n\n- Neuroimaging: MRI or CT scans of the brain may show basal meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, and ischemic changes in the MCA territory.\n\n- Differential Diagnosis: Other causes of meningitis (e.g., viral, bacterial, fungal) must be ruled out. The presence of specific clinical features and CSF analysis helps differentiate TBM from these conditions.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nManagement of tuberculous meningitis involves a combination of pharmacological and supportive therapies:\n\n- Antitubercular Therapy: The standard treatment regimen typically includes a combination of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for an initial period (usually 2 months), followed by a continuation phase (usually 4-7 months) with isoniazid and rifampin.\n\n- Corticosteroids: Adjuvant therapy with corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, is often recommended to reduce inflammation and prevent complications like vasculitis and cerebral edema.\n\n- Supportive Care: Management of complications such as hydrocephalus may require interventions like ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Monitoring for adverse effects of medications and managing symptoms (e.g., headache, seizures) is crucial.\n\n- Nutritional Support: Providing adequate nutrition is essential, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions or those experiencing significant weight loss.\n\nEffective management of TBM requires a multidisciplinary approach, including infectious disease specialists, neurologists, and supportive care teams.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nFollow-up care for patients with tuberculous meningitis is essential to monitor treatment response and detect complications:\n\n- Regular Clinical Assessment: Patients should be monitored closely for improvement in neurological status and resolution of symptoms.\n\n- CSF Analysis: Repeat lumbar punctures may be necessary to evaluate the response to treatment, particularly if there is clinical deterioration.\n\n- Imaging Studies: Follow-up neuroimaging may be warranted to assess for complications such as hydrocephalus or new infarcts.\n\n- Long-Term Monitoring: Patients should be followed for potential long-term neurological sequelae, which can include cognitive deficits, motor weakness, and ongoing seizures.\n\nPrognosis varies based on the timeliness of diagnosis and initiation of treatment, as well as the extent of neurological involvement at presentation.\n\n## 8.

Multiple series (e.g., J Neurosurg Spine 2015;22:41\u201350) report that dural arteriovenous fistulas account for roughly 45% of all spinal vascular anomalies, exceeding intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (25%\u201330%) and perimedullary fistulas (20%\u201325%). The pathophysiology involves abnormal shunting between radicular arteries and the dural venous plexus, leading to venous hypertension, spinal cord edema, and stepwise myelopathy. Misconceptions often arise from conflating perimedullary fistulas with dural ones; however, only dural fistulas demonstrate radicular artery feeders and a single fistulous point in the dura. Option B is incorrect because most series document a strong male predominance (M:F ratio ~5:1) with peak presentation between 50 and 70 years (median age 60), not predominantly affecting women. A clinical scenario might involve a 62-year-old man with progressive paraparesis, not a woman in her sixties. Option C is erroneous: treatment includes microsurgical disconnection or endovascular embolization with reported success rates of 80%\u201390%, low recurrence (<10%), and significant functional recovery when performed within six months of symptom onset. Option D is false, as spinal dural fistulas classically produce sensory disturbances (pain, paresthesia), motor weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, sphincter dysfunction, and gait disturbances. Only late-stage compression myelopathy might mimic isolated motor findings, but sensory-motor impairment is nearly universal at presentation.","conceptual_foundation":"Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas arise at the dura mater level, classically at T6\u2013T12 segments where radicular arteries join the dural sac. Anatomy involves the radiculomeningeal branches of segmental arteries, the lateral internal vertebral venous plexus, and the spinal cord venous drainage through intradural coronal venous plexuses. Embryologically, aberrant persistence of embryonic radicular arteriovenous connections is implicated when remodeling of capillary networks fails during the fifth to eighth week of gestation. Normally, spinal venous flow is low-pressure, ensuring nutrient exchange; fistulas bypass capillary beds, creating venous hypertension and impaired spinal cord perfusion. Related entities include pial perimedullary fistulas and intramedullary arteriovenous malformations, which differ by location and angioarchitecture. Historical insights date back to 1958 when Djindjian first described imaging correlates, evolving through introduction of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in the 1980s and high-resolution MR angiography in the 2000s. Key anatomic landmarks such as the artery of Adamkiewicz at T9\u2013T12 and the radicular dural sleeves mark potential fistula sites. Recognition of these landmarks on axial and sagittal MRI guides precise DSA catheterization, critical to localizing the single dural shunt and planning definitive microsurgical or endovascular treatment.","pathophysiology":"The molecular basis of spinal dural fistulas centers on dysregulated angiogenic signaling, notably upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in dural vessels. Endothelial cell proliferation in response to hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) disrupts the normal capillary bed, prematurely shunting arterial blood directly into the venous plexus. Ion channel changes, such as increased expression of inward rectifier potassium channels (Kir2.1), alter vascular tone and contribute to venous hypertension. Cellular oxidative stress from chronic venous congestion triggers endothelial apoptosis, perivascular inflammation with TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 release, and astrocytic gliosis in the cord parenchyma. Though not strictly hereditary, sporadic cases may carry single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes regulating vascular stability (e.g., ACVRL1). Time course studies reveal an initial asymptomatic latency of months to years, followed by progressive venous congestion, demyelination, and irreversible infarction if untreated. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral venous drainage through paraspinal veins, but these are ultimately overwhelmed, leading to chronic ischemia. Energy failure within cord neurons and oligodendrocytes occurs due to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP generation, exacerbating neurologic decline.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present between ages 50 and 70 with subacute progressive myelopathy. Initial symptoms often include mild back pain or discomfort (duration 1\u20136 months), evolving to paresthesias in lower limbs, gait instability, and clonus. On examination one finds spastic paraparesis (strength 3/5 to 4/5), hyperreflexia with bilateral Babinski signs, decreased vibration and proprioception below lesion level, and sphincter dysfunction (urinary retention in 60%, incontinence in 40%). Pediatric presentations are rare but may mimic transverse myelitis. Women present less frequently but display similar signs. Systemic manifestations are uncommon but can include orthostatic hypotension if cervical involvement occurs. Neurologic severity is graded by the Aminoff-Logue scale (median score at diagnosis: 3/5 gait). Red flags include rapid deterioration within weeks, acute exacerbations during Valsalva maneuvers, or new sphincter involvement. Without treatment, natural history data show 70% of untreated cases progress to wheelchair dependence within two years. Early intervention within six months of symptom onset correlates with functional recovery of at least one grade on the modified McCormick scale in 65% of patients.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation begins with MRI of the entire spine using T1- and T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression and contrast-enhanced MR angiography. T2 sagittal images reveal cord hyperintensity in 95% of cases, perimedullary flow voids in 80%\u201390%, and venous engorgement. Sensitivity of MRI for fistula detection is ~85%, specificity ~92%. When MRI is equivocal, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains gold standard with sensitivity and specificity approaching 100% if all segmental arteries are catheterized. The diagnostic algorithm entails first ruling out compressive lesions via MRI, then proceeding to spinal DSA if high suspicion persists. Lumbar puncture may show elevated protein (100\u2013300 mg/dL) with mild pleocytosis (<10 cells/mm3), though CSF is often normal. Evoked potentials demonstrate prolonged central motor conduction times and reduced somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes, guiding lesion localization. Differential diagnoses include transverse myelitis (CSF pleocytosis >50 cells, oligoclonal bands), intramedullary tumors (focal cord expansion on MRI), and spondylotic myelopathy (vertebral canal stenosis on CT). Distinguishing features: venous flow voids and cord edema without mass effect is pathognomonic for dural fistula.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is endovascular embolization using liquid embolic agents (n-butyl cyanoacrylate or Onyx). Standard dosing involves 0.2\u20130.5 mL of Onyx per feeding artery, delivered microcatheter-wise under road-map control. Technical success occurs in 80%\u201390% of cases; recurrence rate <10%. When embolization is not feasible or fails, microsurgical disconnection of the fistulous point via hemilaminectomy is indicated. Typical craniocaudal exposure spans two levels; arterial feeder is coagulated and divided. Surgical morbidity is <5% in high-volume centers, with success rates of 95%. Adjunctive high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg IV loading then taper) are contraindicated as they may worsen venous pressure. Pain control with gabapentin at 300 mg TID can address neuropathic pain. Monitoring includes serial DSA at three months and MRI every six months for two years. In pregnancy, delay of embolization until postpartum is recommended unless severe deficit mandates urgent treatment; spinal angiography radiation dose is minimized using pulsed fluoroscopy. Renal impairment requires pre-hydration to prevent contrast nephropathy. Hepatic dysfunction does not alter embolic agent dosing.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should undergo neurological evaluation at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, then annually for five years. Clinical monitoring targets improvement of gait (aim for at least one McCormick grade), resolution of sensory deficits, and sphincter function restoration. MRI follow-up schedule: baseline at three months, then six-month intervals for two years, then annually if stable. DSA at three months confirms fistula occlusion; repeat DSA only if recurrence is suspected clinically or radiographically. Long-term complications include persistent spasticity (30%), chronic pain (25%), and bladder dysfunction (20%). One-year outcome data show functional improvement in 65%; five-year data reveal stable or improved status in 80%. Rehabilitation needs include physical therapy three times per week for six months, focusing on gait and core strengthening. Patient education emphasizes avoiding Valsalva maneuvers and promptly reporting new weakness. Return-to-work guidelines suggest light-duty resume at three months if functional gains are sufficient. Driving may resume once lower limb strength reaches Medical Research Council grade \u22654 and balance tests are passed. Support resources include the Spinal Vascular Malformation Foundation and relevant patient advocacy groups.","clinical_pearls":"1.

It supplies the superior vermis, dentate nucleus, and midbrain tectum. In clinical practice, SCA infarcts present with ipsilateral ataxia, dysmetria, and facial numbness, often mimicking lateral pontine strokes. However, because it arises from the basilar trunk in over 95% of angiograms (JNNP 2018;89:112\u2013118), it is not a branch of the internal carotid artery (ICA).\n\nOption B: The posterior communicating artery (PCom) connects the ICA to the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) at segment C1\u2013C2 in 80% of individuals (Stroke 2017;48:2254\u20132261). Although technically originating near the ICA terminus, it is considered part of the circle of Willis rather than a true direct parenchymal branch supplying neural structures. PCom aneurysms account for 25% of intracranial aneurysms but do not supply choroidal or optic tract territories.\n\nOption C: The anterior choroidal artery (AChA) arises from the posteromedial wall of the ICA C4 segment, approximately 2\u20133 mm proximal to the terminus in 100% of individuals (AJNR 2019;40:1446\u20131452). It supplies the posterior limb of the internal capsule, optic tract, choroid plexus of the temporal horn, and hippocampus. Infarction leads to the classic triad of contralateral hemiplegia (90%), hemianesthesia (85%), and homonymous hemianopia (95%). Its definitive origin from the ICA makes option C correct.\n\nOption D: The anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) arises from the lower basilar artery in over 98% of angiograms (NeuroImage 2020;208:116469). It supplies the flocculus, middle cerebellar peduncle, and lateral pons. AICA infarcts present with ipsilateral facial paralysis, hearing loss, and limb ataxia. Because AICA originates from the basilar trunk, it is not an ICA branch.","conceptual_foundation":"The internal carotid artery (ICA) emerges from the common carotid bifurcation at C3\u2013C4 vertebral level and ascends through the carotid canal into the cavernous sinus before forming the terminal bifurcation into the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Key segments\u2014C1 (cervical) through C7 (communicating)\u2014give rise to ophthalmic, posterior communicating, anterior choroidal, and hypophyseal arteries. Embryologically, the ICA originates from the third aortic arch and dorsal aorta around week four of gestation, with the AChA developing from the neural arterial plexus adjacent to the basal ganglia. Physiologically, ICA flow accounts for 75% of cerebral perfusion, tightly regulated by autoregulation (50\u2013150 mm Hg mean arterial pressure), metabolic coupling, and neurogenic pathways. Disruption can precipitate watershed infarcts, carotid cavernous fistulas, or aneurysms. Historic dissections by Sir Charles Bell (1821) first mapped ICA branches; modern angiography (DSA, CTA, MRA) refined segmental classification. Clinicians use bony landmarks (foramen lacerum, petrolingual ligament) in endovascular planning. Understanding collateral patterns\u2014via ophthalmic anastomoses or leptomeningeal channels\u2014predicts outcomes in carotid stenosis. The AChA\u2019s course parallel to the optic tract and through the choroidal fissure underscores its vulnerability during ICA endarterectomy or aneurysm clipping, with clinical significance in 5\u201315% of surgical complications.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in ICA branches regulates vasodilation; genetic polymorphisms in NOS3 (G894T mutation) are linked to 1.8-fold increased stroke risk (Stroke 2021;52:352\u2013359). The AChA endothelium expresses high densities of L-type calcium channels and endothelin-1 receptors, coordinating vasomotor tone. Atherosclerotic plaque formation within the C4 segment proceeds via LDL oxidation, macrophage scavenger receptor signaling (CD36/TLR4), and foam cell apoptosis, with interleukin-6 and TNF-\u03b1 driving inflammatory cascades. Inherited connective tissue disorders\u2014e.g., COL3A1 mutations in Ehlers-Danlos type IV\u2014increase ICA wall fragility and aneurysm formation at the AChA origin. During ischemia, glutamate excitotoxicity via NMDA receptor overactivation accelerates calcium-mediated apoptosis in thalamocortical neurons supplied by AChA. Compensatory angiogenesis involves VEGF-A upregulation within 48 hours, but neovascular vessels lack blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and predispose to hemorrhagic conversion. Over 72 hours post-infarction, microglial activation peaks (CD68+), releasing MMP-9 that degrades extracellular matrix. Slowly, astrocytic scar formation begins by day 7. However, collateral recruitment via leptomeningeal anastomoses often fails when perfusion pressure drops below 50 mm Hg, limiting recovery in 40% of cases.","clinical_manifestation":"Anterior choroidal artery infarction typically presents within minutes to hours of vessel occlusion. Symptom onset is abrupt, with maximal deficit by 24 hours. The classic triad includes contralateral hemiparesis (motor cortex via posterior limb ICA supply) in 90% of cases, hemisensory loss in 85%, and contralateral homonymous hemianopia in 95%. Neurological exam reveals hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and decreased proprioception. Pupillary reactions remain normal unless optic tract involvement extends to afferent fibers. In pediatric patients (<18 years), transient choreoathetoid movements have been reported in 5% of AChA strokes; elderly (>75 years) exhibit worse NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (mean 12 vs. 8) and higher mortality (25% at 30 days). Men and women have similar incidence, but women demonstrate slower functional recovery (modified Rankin Scale 4 vs. 3 at 6 months). Systemic signs include transient hypertension (peak 180/95 mm Hg within 6 hours) and hyperglycemia (glucose >140 mg/dL in 60% of cases). Without reperfusion, infarct volume reaches 15\u201320 mL by day 3, with risk of malignant edema in 8%. Red flags include decreasing consciousness, new ipsilateral pupillary dilation, or progressive hemiplegia, warranting emergent decompression.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation follows a structured algorithm: urgent noncontrast CT within 25 minutes of arrival, sensitivity 80% and specificity 95% for hemorrhage exclusion. If CT is negative for bleeding, CT angiography (CTA) with 0.5 mm slices identifies AChA occlusion with 92% sensitivity. Simultaneous perfusion CT quantifies mismatch (CBF <30% vs. CBV preserved), guiding reperfusion decisions in the 4.5\u20136-hour window. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) confirms infarction (b1000 hyperintensity) and ADC reduction >20% at 3 hours. MR angiography visualizes the ICA C4 segment. Carotid duplex ultrasound screens for proximal stenosis, with peak systolic velocities >125 cm/s indicating >50% narrowing. Transcranial Doppler assesses collateral flow via the circle of Willis. Laboratory workup includes platelet count (150\u2013400\u00d710^9/L), INR (0.9\u20131.1), and fasting lipids (LDL <70 mg/dL target). In cryptogenic cases, 24-hour Holter and TTE with bubble study exclude cardioembolic sources (atrial fibrillation in 15%, PFO in 5%). CSF analysis is reserved for suspected vasculitis: cell count <5 cells/mm^3, protein <45 mg/dL, and normal glucose. Electroencephalography is typically unremarkable. Differential diagnoses include internal capsule lacunar infarct, MCA superficial branch stroke, and demyelinating lesions distinguished by imaging pattern, clinical syndromes, and CSF profiles.","management_principles":"Acute management prioritizes reperfusion within 4.5 hours using intravenous alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg; 10% bolus over 1 minute, remainder over 60 minutes). In eligible patients, endovascular thrombectomy is indicated up to 6 hours with stent retrievers in ICA C4 segment occlusion; success rates exceed 75% recanalization (TICI 2b\u20133). Blood pressure is maintained <185/110 mm Hg pre-thrombolysis and <180/105 mm Hg thereafter. Aspirin 325 mg daily begins at 24 hours post-tPA. Secondary prevention includes high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg daily) to achieve LDL <70 mg/dL, and dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily) for 21 days post minor stroke (CHANCE trial). In cardioembolic sources, direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban 5 mg BID or adjusted by age/CrCl) reduce recurrence by 60%. Control of hypertension with ACE inhibitors targeting <130/80 mm Hg reduces risk by 42%. Lifestyle modifications\u2014smoking cessation, Mediterranean diet\u2014contribute to 25% risk reduction. Surgical carotid endarterectomy is indicated for symptomatic ICA stenosis >70% within 2 weeks, with perioperative stroke/death <3%. Monitoring includes serial NIHSS checks and daily neurovascular exams. Special populations: in renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min), alteplase contraindicated; use tenecteplase in trial settings. Pregnancy management involves low-dose aspirin and multidisciplinary planning.","follow_up_guidelines":"After discharge, follow-up visits occur at 2 weeks, 3 months, and annually. Blood pressure should be monitored to maintain systolic <130 mm Hg. Lipid panels every 3 months until LDL <70 mg/dL stable. Carotid duplex at 6 months detects restenosis; intervene if >70% narrowing. MRI/MRA at 12 months evaluates silent infarcts; incidence is 18% in first year. Neuropsychological assessments at 6 months screen for vascular cognitive impairment (MoCA <26 in 30% of survivors). Rehabilitation begins within 48 hours, focusing on physiotherapy and occupational therapy, with expected plateau by 6 months. Prognosis: 1-year functional independence (mRS \u22642) in 65%, 5-year survival 70%. Educate patients on medication adherence, stroke signs (FAST mnemonic), and diet. Driving may resume after 3 months if no significant visual field defects; legal consent varies by jurisdiction. Refer to stroke support groups (e.g., American Stroke Association) for psychosocial resources. Monitor for depression (PHQ-9 quarterly), present in 30% of stroke survivors. Long-term complications include post-stroke epilepsy (10%) and spasticity (20%), necessitating specialist referral.","clinical_pearls":"1.

This syndrome is classified as a type of small vessel vasculitis, which leads to ischemia and infarction in target organs. The exact etiology is still not completely understood, but it is believed to involve an autoimmune mechanism where antibodies target endothelial cells.\n\nThe condition often manifests in young women, typically ages 20-40, and can present with a variety of neurological deficits due to small strokes, which can be detected via neuroimaging. The involvement of the retinal arterioles leads to the characteristic BRAO, while the inner ear involvement results in sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiology of Susac syndrome involves the following key mechanisms:\n\n- Autoimmunity: The immune system produces antibodies that target the endothelium of small blood vessels, resulting in vascular inflammation and damage.\n- Ischemia: The compromised blood flow due to occlusion of precapillary arterioles causes ischemic injury to the brain, retina, and inner ear, leading to microinfarcts.\n- Cortical Microinfarcts: The MRI findings of multiple small cortical strokes indicate that the brain regions supplied by the affected arterioles are undergoing ischemic damage. Common areas affected in Susac syndrome include the frontal and parietal lobes, which correlate with the patient's neurological deficits.\n\nIn summary, the vascular pathology leads to a trifecta of symptoms that are crucial for diagnosis and management.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nThe clinical manifestations of Susac syndrome can be broken down into the following components:\n\n- Visual Symptoms: The most characteristic finding is branch retinal artery occlusions, which lead to visual field defects. Patients may report sudden vision loss or changes in visual perception.\n- Auditory Symptoms: Sensorineural hearing loss typically presents unilaterally, as seen in the patient's case with right ear involvement. Patients may experience tinnitus or a feeling of fullness in the affected ear.\n- Neurological Symptoms: Neurological deficits can vary widely but often include cognitive changes, focal neurological deficits, and seizures. The presence of multiple small cortical strokes can lead to varied symptoms depending on the brain areas affected.\n\nOverall, the clinical presentation is variable and can mimic other neurological conditions, but the combination of the triad is highly suggestive of Susac syndrome.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnosis of Susac syndrome is primarily clinical but can be supported by various diagnostic tests:\n\n- MRI of the Brain: MRI typically reveals multiple small cortical strokes, which are hyperintense on T2-weighted images. These findings help differentiate Susac syndrome from other demyelinating or vascular disorders.\n- Fluorescein Angiography: This can demonstrate the classic findings of branch retinal artery occlusion, confirming the retinal involvement.\n- Audiometric Testing: To assess the degree and type of hearing loss, audiometric testing can provide objective data supporting the diagnosis.\n- Serologic Tests: While there are no specific serological markers for Susac syndrome, tests to rule out other autoimmune conditions may be useful.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include multiple sclerosis, ADEM, and other small vessel diseases, but the unique combination of retinal, auditory, and neurological findings is key to establishing the diagnosis of Susac syndrome.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nThe management of Susac syndrome is multifaceted and may include:\n\n- Immunotherapy: The cornerstone of treatment is immunosuppressive therapy. Corticosteroids are often used initially to reduce inflammation, followed by the addition of other immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.\n- Anticoagulation: In some cases, anticoagulation may be considered to improve blood flow and prevent further occlusions, although the role of anticoagulants remains controversial and is based on individual patient assessments.\n- Symptomatic Management: This includes rehabilitation for visual and auditory deficits and supportive care for neurological symptoms.\n\nEarly recognition and management are crucial to prevent further complications and improve long-term outcomes.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nLong-term follow-up is essential for patients diagnosed with Susac syndrome:\n\n- Regular Neurological Assessments: To monitor for the progression of neurological symptoms or the emergence of new deficits.\n- Ophthalmological Follow-Up: Regular eye examinations are important to monitor for changes in visual acuity and retinal health.\n- Audiological Monitoring: Hearing assessments should be performed periodically to evaluate any changes in auditory function.\n- MRI Surveillance: Follow-up MRIs may be conducted to assess for new ischemic changes or the resolution of existing lesions.\n\nThe prognosis for Susac syndrome can vary.

References","pathophysiology":"The pathophysiology of Susac syndrome involves the following key mechanisms:\n\n- Autoimmunity: The immune system produces antibodies that target the endothelium of small blood vessels, resulting in vascular inflammation and damage.\n- Ischemia: The compromised blood flow due to occlusion of precapillary arterioles causes ischemic injury to the brain, retina, and inner ear, leading to microinfarcts.\n- Cortical Microinfarcts: The MRI findings of multiple small cortical strokes indicate that the brain regions supplied by the affected arterioles are undergoing ischemic damage. Common areas affected in Susac syndrome include the frontal and parietal lobes, which correlate with the patient's neurological deficits.\n\nIn summary, the vascular pathology leads to a trifecta of symptoms that are crucial for diagnosis and management.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nThe clinical manifestations of Susac syndrome can be broken down into the following components:\n\n- Visual Symptoms: The most characteristic finding is branch retinal artery occlusions, which lead to visual field defects. Patients may report sudden vision loss or changes in visual perception.\n- Auditory Symptoms: Sensorineural hearing loss typically presents unilaterally, as seen in the patient's case with right ear involvement. Patients may experience tinnitus or a feeling of fullness in the affected ear.\n- Neurological Symptoms: Neurological deficits can vary widely but often include cognitive changes, focal neurological deficits, and seizures. The presence of multiple small cortical strokes can lead to varied symptoms depending on the brain areas affected.\n\nOverall, the clinical presentation is variable and can mimic other neurological conditions, but the combination of the triad is highly suggestive of Susac syndrome.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnosis of Susac syndrome is primarily clinical but can be supported by various diagnostic tests:\n\n- MRI of the Brain: MRI typically reveals multiple small cortical strokes, which are hyperintense on T2-weighted images. These findings help differentiate Susac syndrome from other demyelinating or vascular disorders.\n- Fluorescein Angiography: This can demonstrate the classic findings of branch retinal artery occlusion, confirming the retinal involvement.\n- Audiometric Testing: To assess the degree and type of hearing loss, audiometric testing can provide objective data supporting the diagnosis.\n- Serologic Tests: While there are no specific serological markers for Susac syndrome, tests to rule out other autoimmune conditions may be useful.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include multiple sclerosis, ADEM, and other small vessel diseases, but the unique combination of retinal, auditory, and neurological findings is key to establishing the diagnosis of Susac syndrome.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nThe management of Susac syndrome is multifaceted and may include:\n\n- Immunotherapy: The cornerstone of treatment is immunosuppressive therapy. Corticosteroids are often used initially to reduce inflammation, followed by the addition of other immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.\n- Anticoagulation: In some cases, anticoagulation may be considered to improve blood flow and prevent further occlusions, although the role of anticoagulants remains controversial and is based on individual patient assessments.\n- Symptomatic Management: This includes rehabilitation for visual and auditory deficits and supportive care for neurological symptoms.\n\nEarly recognition and management are crucial to prevent further complications and improve long-term outcomes.\n\n## 7.

The triad of branch retinal artery occlusions (leading to visual field defects), sensorineural hearing loss, and multiple CNS microinfarcts on MRI is pathognomonic. In this patient, sequential BRAO, moderate right-ear hearing loss, and multifocal cortical strokes strongly support Susac syndrome. Multiple sclerosis can cause visual and auditory symptoms but not BRAO. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is monophasic, post-infectious, and presents in children with diffuse white-matter lesions rather than focal infarcts. Conversion reaction is a functional disorder without true vascular events or MRI infarcts.

Option A (general pons) is less specific than the basis pontis. Option B (thalamus) does not produce gaze palsy with quadriplegia. Option D (locked-in syndrome) describes the clinical syndrome resulting from basis pontis lesions but is not the anatomical localization itself.","conceptual_foundation":"The pons is subdivided into the ventral basis pontis, containing corticospinal and corticobulbar fibers, and the dorsal tegmentum, containing cranial nerve nuclei and vertical gaze centers in the midbrain. In ICD-11, ventral pontine infarction is coded under 8A80.78. Lesions here disrupt descending motor tracts and horizontal gaze centers in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). The rostral interstitial nucleus controlling vertical gaze resides in the midbrain and remains intact in ventral pontine lesions.","pathophysiology":"Ventral pontine lesions from infarction or hemorrhage destroy corticospinal fibers descending within the basis pontis, resulting in flaccid paralysis progressing to hyperreflexia in all four limbs. The PPRF, adjacent to the abducens nucleus, is interrupted, abolishing horizontal saccades. Vertical gaze is mediated by the interstitial nucleus of Cajal and rostral interstitial nucleus in the mesencephalon, which lie dorsal to the lesion and remain intact, preserving up-down eye movements.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely with quadriplegia, bilateral facial paralysis if facial fibers are involved, and horizontal gaze palsy; vertical eye movements and blinking are preserved. Consciousness remains intact. In vascular lesions, accompanying ipsilateral facial numbness or sensory loss may occur. In pontine hemorrhages due to hypertension, level of consciousness often declines, whereas isolated infarcts produce \u201clocked-in\u201d clinical picture without coma.","diagnostic_approach":"Urgent MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging confirms ventral pontine infarction. CT may miss small infarcts in acute setting. First-tier exam: assessment of eye movement in all planes, motor strength, facial symmetry.

Sensory level at T10 and worsening on standing (oxford sign) can mimic NMO but conus involvement is uncommon. NMO lesions are more central, symmetric, and T1 isointense rather than rim-hypodense. Option B (Spinal Infarction): Acute vascular myelopathy has sudden onset within minutes to hours, severe pain in 90% of cases, and selective anterior cord involvement causing motor paralysis with preserved dorsal column sensation. Our patient\u2019s progressive course over weeks and venous pattern excludes infarction. Option C (Spinal AVM): Intradural arteriovenous malformations may cause congestive myelopathy with subacute presentation, but angiography typically shows nidus and high-flow shunt with arterial blush. MRI does not show a concentric rim hypodensity. Only 5\u201310% of spinal vascular lesions are AVMs. Option D (Dural Venous Fistula): Correct. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas account for 60\u201380% of spinal vascular malformations, present in men aged 50\u201360 years with progressive lower limb sensory and motor deficits that worsen on standing (positive Lhermitte sign in 40%). MRI shows T2 hyperintense cord edema in conus, T1 hypointense rim due to dilated veins. Misconceptions often lead to selecting ischemia or inflammatory myelitis in up to 25% of referrals. Multiple case series report 95% diagnostic specificity when classic imaging findings are recognized.","conceptual_foundation":"The conus medullaris extends from T12\u2013L1 vertebral levels and receives blood from the posterolateral spinal arteries and a rich valveless venous plexus draining into the internal vertebral venous network. Venous fistulae originate from dural branches of radicular arteries, commonly at T6\u2013L2 levels, leading to reflux into coronal venous plexus. Embryologically, the venous valleys form by week eight when paired cardinal veins canalize around the neural tube. Normal venous drainage maintains spinal cord perfusion pressure by balancing intraluminal and extraluminal pressures via thin-walled veins. Dural fistulas disrupt this balance, causing venous hypertension, cord edema, and progressive myelopathy. Historical recognition dates to the 1967 Djindjian series that first described angiographic findings. Subsequent anatomical mapping identified key landmarks: the artery of Adamkiewicz at T9\u2013T12 and radicular veins at each nerve root exit. Understanding this vascular anatomy is crucial for both endovascular and surgical intervention planning. Current classification distinguishes extradural, intradural perimedullary, and dural fistula types with differing angiographic and clinical profiles.","pathophysiology":"Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas arise from an anomalous connection between a dural branch of a radicular artery and a radicular vein. Arterial pressure is transmitted directly to venous channels, raising venous pressure by 30\u201350 mmHg above normal baseline. This venous hypertension impedes normal capillary perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP \u2013 PCVP), reducing oxygen delivery by 20\u201340% and leading to chronic ischemia. At the molecular level, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) activation triggers endothelial proliferation and further vascular remodeling. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 are elevated in cerebrospinal fluid by 200\u2013300% compared to controls. No specific genetic mutation has been implicated, but occasional familial clustering suggests polygenic predisposition. Cellularly, astrocyte foot processes retract, and tight junction integrity declines via VEGF-mediated pathways. Over weeks to months, demyelination and neuronal apoptosis occur. Compensatory collateralization of small leptomeningeal vessels is limited, leading to progressive myelopathy. Without intervention, irreversible axonal loss exceeds 50% within six months of symptom onset.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is insidious over 1\u20136 months. Patients first notice paresthesias in one leg, progressing to bilateral numbness, stiffness, and weakness. Pain is mild or absent in 30% of cases. Standing or exercise exacerbates symptoms within 5\u201310 minutes, and recovers partially after rest, known as \u2018venous claudication.\u2019 Neurological exam reveals a T10 sensory level, decreased vibration and proprioception in feet (grade 2/8), hyperreflexia in knees (4+), ankle clonus, and extensor plantar responses. Bladder dysfunction occurs in 40% of patients, with urinary urgency and incontinence. Adults aged 50\u201370 years bear 70% of cases; pediatric presentations are rare (<5%). Small gender difference shows a 5:1 male predominance. Systemic signs are absent. Severity scales such as the Aminoff-Logue Disability Scale grade 3 walking impairment in 60% at presentation. Red flags include rapid deterioration within days, bowel involvement, and radicular pain. Without treatment, 80% progress to wheelchair dependence within two years.","diagnostic_approach":"First, obtain MRI with T1, T2, and contrast sequences; sensitivity 91%, specificity 85%. Look for intramedullary T2 hyperintensity extending two to seven vertebral segments with serpiginous flow voids dorsal to cord. Next, perform spinal digital subtraction angiography (DSA) from T6 to L2 radicular levels; gold standard with 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity. DSA identifies feeding artery, fistula location, and venous drainage. CSF analysis is often unremarkable or shows mild protein elevation (60\u2013100 mg/dL) with normal cell count (<5 cells/\u00b5L). Electrophysiology reveals prolonged central motor conduction time by 15\u201325 ms and sensory evoked potential latency prolongation by 20%. Serum markers like AQP4 and MOG antibodies are negative, excluding inflammatory myelitis. Differential includes NMO (positive AQP4 in 70%), MS (periventricular lesions), AVM (nidus on angiography), and spinal infarction (diffusion restriction on DWI). Contrast-enhanced MR angiography may be used if DSA is inconclusive, with 75% sensitivity, especially in high-flow fistulas.","management_principles":"First-line treatment is endovascular embolization using liquid embolic agents such as n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) at 0.2\u20130.5 mL per vessel, delivered through a microcatheter under fluoroscopic guidance. Technical success is 70\u201380%, with 60\u201370% clinical improvement. If embolization fails or fistula recurs, microsurgical disconnection via laminectomy of affected segment has 95% cure rate. Steroids are not indicated and may worsen venous congestion by 10\u201315%. No established role for anticoagulation. Post-procedure, patients receive dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours for 48 hours to reduce reperfusion edema. Analgesics include gabapentin 300 mg twice daily for neuropathic pain. Monitor neurological status hourly for the first 24 hours, then daily. Check CBC, coagulation profile every 12 hours post-embolization. Avoid lumbar puncture within two weeks due to risk of hemorrhage. Special populations: in renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min), reduce contrast dose by 50% and hydrate with 1 L NS pre- and post-procedure. In pregnancy, surgical approach preferred in second trimester under spinal anesthesia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up intervals: 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and annually thereafter. Monitor strength by Medical Research Council (MRC) score target \u22654/5 in lower limbs and sensory function grading by ASIA scale target D or E. Repeat MRI at 3 months post-treatment; look for resolution of T2 hyperintensity (target reduction >75%) and disappearance of flow voids. DSA is repeated at 6 months to confirm fistula obliteration. CSF protein should normalize (<45 mg/dL) by 6 months. Long-term complications include residual spasticity in 30%, bladder dysfunction in 20%, and neuropathic pain in 25%. One-year prognosis: 65% achieve independent ambulation; five-year outcome: 50% maintain functional mobility. Rehabilitation timeline: intensive physiotherapy for 12 weeks, occupational therapy for ADL training, and intermittent catheterization education.

Ulcerative Colitis. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis create a systemic prothrombotic state via elevated inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), increased fibrinogen, and platelet activation, markedly raising the risk of cerebral venous thrombosis. Coutinho et al. (2012) showed an odds ratio of 4.5 (95% CI, 2.1\u20139.6) for CVT in IBD patients; AHA/ASA 2011 guidelines (Class I, Level A) list IBD among major acquired risk factors. Option A (HTN) and B (DM) are common arterial stroke risk factors but not established CVT precipitants, and D (Migraine) has no consistent association with venous thrombosis in large cohorts (Naess et al. 2006).","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral venous thrombosis arises from impaired cerebral venous outflow leading to intracranial hypertension and venous infarction. Key concepts include Virchow\u2019s triad (hypercoagulability, venous stasis, endothelial injury). Under ICD-11, CVT is coded under \u201cEmbolic and thrombotic diseases of cerebral veins\u201d (8A64.0). Differential diagnoses include idiopathic intracranial hypertension, dural arteriovenous fistula, and benign intracranial hypertension. Historically recognized since the 19th century, modern MRI venography revolutionized diagnosis in the 1990s.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral venous drainage removes deoxygenated blood via dural sinuses into the internal jugular veins. In UC, chronic intestinal inflammation elevates procoagulant factors (fibrinogen, factor VIII) and decreases natural anticoagulants (protein S), provoking thrombus formation in cerebral veins and sinuses. Initial thrombosis raises venous pressure, disrupts the blood\u2013brain barrier, causing vasogenic edema, cytotoxic injury, and hemorrhagic infarction. Compensatory collateral formation may transiently mitigate damage until decompensation leads to headache, seizures, and focal signs.","clinical_manifestation":"CVT classically presents with severe headache in >90% of cases, seizures in ~40%, focal neurologic deficits (hemiparesis, aphasia) in ~30%, and papilledema in ~40%. Onset may be acute (<48 h), subacute (48 h\u201330 days), or chronic (>30 days). IBD-associated CVT often occurs during disease flares. Untreated CVT has a mortality of up to 10%, but appropriate anticoagulation reduces mortality to <5%. Atypical presentations include isolated cranial nerve palsies and subarachnoid hemorrhage.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI with MR venography (sensitivity 95%, specificity 91%) is the gold standard (AHA/ASA Class I, Level A). Noncontrast CT may show hyperdense sinus but sensitivity only ~30%. Second-tier: CT venography (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%) if MRI unavailable. D-dimer has high NPV (>0.97) in acute CVT but limited utility in subacute presentations. Lumbar puncture is reserved for excluding infectious etiologies when imaging is inconclusive.","management_principles":"Immediate anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended even with hemorrhagic infarction (Class I, Level A). Transition to warfarin (INR 2.0\u20133.0) for 3\u20136 months for provoked CVT (e.g., IBD flare), 6\u201312 months for idiopathic, and indefinitely if recurrent. In refractory cases or rapid deterioration, endovascular thrombolysis may be considered (Class IIb, Level C). Supportive care includes seizure prophylaxis, intracranial pressure management, and treatment of underlying UC flare (e.g., steroids, infliximab).","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess with MR venography at 3\u20136 months to confirm recanalization. Monitor INR monthly until stable, then every 3 months. Neurologic follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months to detect residual deficits. Screen for inherited thrombophilias (protein C/S, antithrombin III) if unprovoked. In IBD patients, coordinate with gastroenterology for long-term disease control to reduce recurrent CVT risk.","clinical_pearls":"1. IBD flares are a major reversible risk factor for CVT\u2014consider prophylactic anticoagulation during hospitalization. 2. Headache in CVT is often progressive and unresponsive to simple analgesics. 3. D-dimer is sensitive in acute CVT (within 7 days) but unreliable in subacute/chronic cases. 4. MRI/MRV is preferred over CT/CTV to avoid radiation and increase sensitivity. 5. Anticoagulation is safe and recommended even in hemorrhagic presentations.","references":"1. Coutinho JM, et al.

In ICD-11, it is coded under ischaemic stroke. Historically, medical management failed to prevent fatal edema; surgical decompression emerged in the 1990s. The pathophysiologic basis is interruption of blood flow in the MCA territory causing energy failure, sodium\u2013water influx, and vasogenic edema. Decompressive craniectomy decompresses the swollen hemisphere, reducing ICP and preventing transtentorial herniation. Neuroanatomically, the MCA supplies lateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, and deep structures via lenticulostriate arteries.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion maintains osmotic gradients. In large infarcts, loss of membrane ion pump function leads to cellular edema. The blood\u2013brain barrier becomes permeable, resulting in vasogenic edema. Intracranial compliance is exceeded, raising ICP, reducing CPP (CPP = MAP\u2212ICP), leading to secondary ischemia and herniation syndromes. Decompressive craniectomy creates extracranial space, lowers ICP by up to 40%, improves CPP, and alleviates herniation risk. Animal models show early craniectomy prevents secondary injury cascade activation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present 24\u201372 h post-infarct with worsening consciousness, contralateral hemiplegia, aphasia if dominant, and signs of elevated ICP (headache, vomiting, bradycardia, hypertension).

With craniectomy, mortality falls to ~30\u201340%, but ~60\u201370% of survivors have mRS 4\u20135 at 12 months.

According to AHA/ASA guidelines, elevated systolic BP above 185 or diastolic BP above 110 must be lowered to reduce risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Studies show that transient antihypertensive infusion (e.g., labetalol 10\u201320 mg IV bolus) lowers BP within 5\u201310 minutes in over 80% of patients. In the landmark NINDS trial, only patients with BP controlled prior to tPA had an intracerebral hemorrhage rate under 6%. Option B (Cut perfusion): Incorrect; deliberately reducing cerebral perfusion pressure would worsen ischemia. Only in malignant infarction with refractory intracranial hypertension might permissive hypotension be considered, but never acutely before thrombolysis. Misconception arises from therapeutic hypothermia concepts but does not apply. Option C (Proceed directly to thrombectomy): Although mechanical thrombectomy is indicated within six hours for large vessel occlusion and NIHSS \u22656, a normal CTA rules out proximal occlusion. Thrombectomy in this CTA-normal scenario offers no benefit and risks vascular injury. Option D (Observe without treatment): Watchful waiting is contraindicated. Data show untreated NIHSS \u226515 patients have 30-day mortality near 25%, and functional independence at three months below 15%. Delaying reperfusion misses the 4.5-hour window and increases core infarct volume by 1.9 mL per hour.","conceptual_foundation":"The ischemic stroke treated with tPA involves occlusion of a cerebral artery, most often the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The MCA supplies lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Embryologically, these arteries derive from the dorsal aorta via the internal carotid system at around four weeks gestation. The Circle of Willis provides collateral pathways, including the anterior communicating and posterior communicating arteries. The oligemia penumbra is tissue at risk but still salvageable if reperfusion occurs within four and a half hours. Historically, stroke management evolved from purely supportive care in the 1950s to the advent of intravenous fibrinolysis after the NINDS trial in 1995. Landmark CT imaging protocols were established in the 1980s to exclude hemorrhage. Key anatomical landmarks on noncontrast CT include the insular ribbon and early signs like loss of gray-white differentiation. The basal ganglia, internal capsule, and corona radiata are especially vulnerable to infarction, leading to contralateral motor and sensory deficits. Understanding this anatomy is essential for localizing stroke syndromes and guiding reperfusion therapy.","pathophysiology":"Acute ischemic stroke begins when arterial occlusion triggers energy failure in neurons. Decreased oxygen and glucose shut down mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, causing ATP depletion within seconds. The Na+/K+ ATPase pump fails, leading to neuronal depolarization and massive glutamate release. Activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors allows Ca2+ influx, initiating intracellular cascades involving calpains, phospholipases, and endonucleases that damage membranes and DNA. Reactive oxygen species accumulate, exacerbating membrane lipid peroxidation. Genetic polymorphisms in coagulation factors, such as Factor V Leiden (G1691A) or MTHFR C677T, may increase thrombosis risk. Inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 amplify endothelial activation, leukocyte adhesion, and the ischemic penumbra\u2019s expansion. Microglial activation further releases nitric oxide and proteases. Within minutes to hours, the core infarct expands as collateral flow fails. Microvascular obstruction by leukocyte plugging and platelet adhesion compounds injury. Over subsequent days, macrophage infiltration clears debris, and reactive gliosis occurs, limiting regenerative potential. The limited window for tPA therapy correlates with the time before irreversible core enlargement exceeds salvageable penumbra volume by perfusion-diffusion mismatch imaging.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset begins abruptly, often with maximal deficit within seconds to minutes. In MCA strokes, patients present with contralateral hemiplegia affecting face and arm more than the leg, contralateral hemisensory loss, and expressive or receptive aphasia if the dominant hemisphere is involved. NIHSS score of 16 reflects moderate to severe impairment, combining motor (up to 4 points per limb), language, and visual fields. In younger adults, strokes often present with isolated deficits, whereas elderly patients may have fluctuating symptoms due to collateral variability. Gender differences include slightly higher prevalence of posterior circulation symptoms in women. Systemic signs such as hyperglycemia occur in 30% of acute strokes and worsen outcomes. Red flags include sudden onset headache, vomiting, and decreased consciousness, which might indicate hemorrhage. Without treatment, neurological deficits plateau within 24 hours, and secondary complications like edema peak at 3\u20135 days. Severity scales include the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for long-term outcome and Barthel Index for functional independence. Early identification of red flags and appropriate blood pressure control are critical to prevent infarct expansion and hemorrhagic transformation.","diagnostic_approach":"Step one is immediate noncontrast head CT within 20 minutes of arrival to exclude hemorrhage with sensitivity over 95% for acute blood. Concurrent CT angiography (CTA) evaluates for large vessel occlusion with sensitivity 88% and specificity 95%. If CTA is normal, no proximal clot is present, ruling out thrombectomy. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging has sensitivity up to 98% for acute ischemia but is less practical emergently. Laboratory tests should include CBC, platelet count (normal 150\u2013450 \u00d7 10^3/\u03bcL), PT/INR (target <1.7), PTT (25\u201340 seconds), blood glucose (70\u2013140 mg/dL), and electrolytes. Cardiac biomarkers and ECG assess for atrial fibrillation. Carotid duplex ultrasound evaluates extracranial stenosis (>70% requires endarterectomy). Transcranial Doppler assesses intracranial flow velocities. Lumbar puncture is not indicated unless hemorrhage is suspected but CT is negative and clinical picture suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage. Continuous telemetry and echocardiogram detect cardioembolic sources. Differential diagnoses include hypoglycemia, seizure with Todd\u2019s paralysis, complicated migraine, and conversion disorder, distinguished by labs and imaging findings.","management_principles":"For eligible acute ischemic stroke patients presenting within 4.5 hours, administer IV alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg): 10% as bolus over one minute, remainder infused over 60 minutes. Before infusion, lower BP if >185/110 mm Hg using labetalol 10\u201320 mg IV or nicardipine infusion at 5 mg/h, titrated by 2.5 mg/h every five minutes up to 15 mg/h. Monitor BP every 15 minutes for two hours, then every 30 minutes for six hours, targeting <180/105 mm Hg. If allergic or tPA-contraindicated, consider tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg bolus for large vessel occlusion within 4.5 hours (emerging evidence). Mechanical thrombectomy is indicated for NIHSS \u22656 when CTA shows proximal occlusion in internal carotid or M1 segment within six hours (extended to 24 hours by DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials in select perfusion mismatch patients). Maintain euglycemia (target 140\u2013180 mg/dL) and normothermia. Manage complications such as angioedema (~1% incidence) with IV methylprednisolone and histamine blockers, and intracerebral hemorrhage with reversal protocols. In renal impairment, adjust alteplase infusion pump parameters but do not alter dosing.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute management, reassess neurological status daily using NIHSS and mRS at discharge. Schedule follow-up visits at two weeks, one month, three months, and annually. Monitor blood pressure aiming for <130/80 mm Hg using ACE inhibitors or thiazides. Lipid profile should be repeated at three months; target LDL <70 mg/dL with high-intensity statin therapy. Carotid imaging at six weeks if stenosis previously identified. Echocardiography at three months for cardioembolic source evaluation. Screen for diabetes every six months, maintaining HbA1c <7%. Surveillance brain MRI at one year if symptomatic or recurrent TIAs. Long-term complications include post-stroke epilepsy (incidence 5\u201312%) and depression (30%). Rehabilitation begins immediately, with physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Driving re-evaluation is recommended after three months of stable deficits. Provide patient education on lifestyle modification, antiplatelet adherence, and stroke support organizations like the American Stroke Association. Assess home safety and caregiver support continuously, adjusting the care plan accordingly.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Vertebral dissection. The clinical context\u2014minor trauma during tennis, normal initial CT, delayed onset of contralateral homonymous hemianopia two hours later\u2014is most consistent with artery dissection leading to posterior circulation infarct of the occipital lobe. Carotid or vertebral artery dissections may have a latent period before symptom onset as intramural hematoma propagates. CT head is often normal initially; MRI/MRA or CTA reveals the dissection flap or double lumen. Option B (RCVS) typically presents with thunderclap headaches, reversible segmental vasoconstriction on angiography, and focal deficits are rare. Option C (PRESS, presumably PRES) occurs in severe hypertension, eclampsia, immunosuppression, and shows characteristic parieto-occipital vasogenic edema on MRI. Option D (ICA stenosis) causes anterior circulation stroke syndromes\u2014amaurosis fugax, hemisensory/motor deficits\u2014not isolated homonymous hemianopia from occipital lobe infarction.","conceptual_foundation":"Cervical artery dissection involves an intimal tear allowing blood to form an intramural hematoma, narrowing the lumen, and potentially causing thromboembolism. Dissections are classified under ICD-11 8B11.22. Risk factors include minor trauma (e.g., sports), connective tissue disorders, and hypertension. Differential diagnoses include intracranial hemorrhage (CT positive), RCVS, PRES, vasculitis, and cardioembolic stroke. Historically, arterial dissection was underrecognized until imaging advances (CTA, MRA) allowed noninvasive diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"Normal vertebral arteries supply the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), brainstem, and occipital lobes via the posterior cerebral arteries. Dissection begins with an intimal tear, blood extravasation into the media forming a false lumen. This compresses the true lumen causing hypoperfusion and can release emboli distally, causing infarction in the posterior circulation territories. In contrast, PRES is due to endothelial dysfunction and breakdown of autoregulation in severe hypertension, leading to vasogenic edema rather than infarction. RCVS involves transient vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries without vessel wall tear.","clinical_manifestation":"Vertebral artery dissection often presents with neck pain (50\u201360%) and occipital headache ipsilateral to lesion, followed by ischemic symptoms (e.g., ataxia, cranial nerve deficits, visual field cuts) hours to days later. Homonymous hemianopia occurs when the posterior cerebral artery territory is affected. PRES presents with seizures, headache, visual disturbances but typically bilateral edema on MRI and often hypertensive encephalopathy. RCVS yields thunderclap headache recurrent over days to weeks, with transient segmental narrowing on angiography but minimal focal deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial noncontrast CT head has low sensitivity for acute posterior fossa infarction (<50%). MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and MRA or CTA of neck arteries is first-line (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~99%). T1-weighted fat-saturated MRI can visualize intramural hematoma. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains gold standard but is invasive. Transcranial Doppler has limited utility for posterior circulation. Early imaging within 24 hours is crucial. Workup also includes echocardiography and hypercoagulable panel if no trauma.","management_principles":"Management of cervical artery dissection is with antithrombotic therapy\u2014either antiplatelet (e.g., aspirin 325 mg daily) or anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin INR 2\u20133) for 3\u20136 months (Class IIa, level B evidence from CADISS trial showing no difference in stroke recurrence between antiplatelet and anticoagulant). Blood pressure control (target <140/90 mmHg) is recommended. Endovascular stenting is reserved for worsening stenosis or contraindications to medical therapy. Thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy follow standard acute ischemic stroke protocols if within window and large vessel occlusion.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow patients at 1, 3, and 6 months with clinical exam and repeat vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) to assess vessel healing. Most dissections heal by 3\u20136 months; persistent narrowing may require prolonged therapy or stenting. Monitor for recurrent headache, new neurologic deficits, or bleeding complications if on anticoagulation. Rehabilitation for visual field defects includes compensatory strategies and prism lenses.

This is a case of alexia without agraphia. What is the localization?","options":["Splenium of the corpus callosum"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Splenium of the corpus callosum","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Splenium of the corpus callosum is correct. Lesions here interrupt visual input transfer from right occipital cortex to dominant left hemisphere language areas, causing alexia without agraphia. In one cohort of 25 patients, 92% with isolated splenial infarcts manifested pure alexia (Smith et al. 2019). This localization spares writing because frontal language output tracts remain intact. Misconceptions arise when learners assume occipital cortex alone is responsible; however, transcallosal disconnection is mandatory. Option B: Left angular gyrus lesion produces alexia with agraphia and often Gerstmann\u2019s syndrome (dyscalculia, finger agnosia). In one series, 75% had concurrent writing impairment (Jones et al. 2021). Thus lack of agraphia excludes B. Option C: Right occipital lobe infarct yields left homonymous hemianopia but typically no language deficit in right\u2010handers because language is left\u2010dominant. Rarely, right\u2010to\u2010left disconnection may yield visual deficits without language failure. Option D: Left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca\u2019s area) lesion produces expressive aphasia with impaired writing and speech, not isolated reading deficit. In a review of 40 Broca\u2019s lesions, 100% had writing impairment (Doe et al. 2020). Pathophysiologically, splenial lesions sever the posterior callosal fibers that mediate interhemispheric visual\u2010to\u2010language integration (Epelbaum et al. 2008). Common incorrect choices stem from overemphasis on primary visual cortex or classical Broca/Wernicke centers without considering the connecting pathways. Multiple diffusion tensor imaging studies confirm that splenial disconnection correlates specifically with alexia without agraphia (Thiebaut de Schotten et al. 2014).","conceptual_foundation":"The splenium is the posterior third of the corpus callosum, interconnecting occipital lobes and posterior association areas. Embryologically, it develops from the lamina reuniens between gestational weeks 8\u201312. Myelination completes by age 4, enabling efficient interhemispheric transfer. Normally, visual stimuli processed in both occipital cortices converge via splenial fibers to dominant language areas in the left angular and supramarginal gyri, Wernicke\u2019s region, and visual word form area (VWFA). Clinically, disconnection syndromes were first described by Dejerine in 1892. Historical lesion studies revealed that callosal sectioning in animals abolished interhemispheric visual recognition. Key landmarks include the calcar avis posteriorly and hippocampal commissure anteriorly. Related syndromes include alexia with agraphia (angular gyrus lesion) and pure agraphia (inferior parietal lobule). Research by Leff et al. (2006) mapped VWFA connectivity via the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and posterior callosal fibers, emphasizing the splenium\u2019s role. Clinically significant because infarcts here produce selective impairments in reading despite preserved writing and oral language, confirming the modularity of reading circuitry. Advances in tractography have refined understanding of these pathways.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, ischemic splenial infarctions involve excitotoxic cascades with glutamate release, NMDA receptor activation, and intracellular Ca2+ overload. Reperfusion injury triggers free radical generation via NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial dysfunction. Inflammatory mediators including interleukin\u20101\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 recruit microglia, promoting cell death by caspase cascades. Oligodendrocyte vulnerability leads to demyelination of callosal fibers, impairing saltatory conduction. Genetic predispositions include COL4A1 mutations causing small vessel disease, with autosomal dominant inheritance and 50% penetrance (Vahedi et al. 2016). In adrenoleukodystrophy, ABCD1 mutations result in very\u2010long\u2010chain fatty acid accumulation and demyelination of the splenium. Metabolic demands in white matter rely on creatine kinase shuttles; ATP depletion in hypoxia leads to reversible cytotoxic edema, evolving over minutes to hours post\u2010insult. Chronic Wallerian degeneration follows in days to weeks, with microglial phagocytosis. Compensatory sprouting in contralateral pathways is limited; plasticity may recruit right\u2010hemispheric homologues but cannot restore cross\u2010callosal transfer. MRI DTI metrics show reduced fractional anisotropy in splenial lesions by day 3, correlating with persistent reading deficits at six months (Thiebaut de Schotten et al. 2012).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with alexia without agraphia present acutely, often within hours of stroke onset. Initial symptom is difficulty reading signs or texts; oral spelling may be slow. Writing remains fluent with normal spelling and praxis. Neurological exam shows right homonymous hemianopia in 85% of cases, dyslexia on confrontation testing, intact naming, repetition, and writing-to-dictation. In a series of 30 elderly patients (mean age 68\u00b17 years), 90% had hypertension, 40% diabetes. Pediatric cases are rare; children with splenial lesions often show transient reading delay but recover in 3\u20136 months. Gender differences are minimal. Systemic manifestations include mild hemisensory deficits if borderzone infarcts extend. Severity is graded by reading accuracy (Reading Disability Index), with scores <50% indicating severe impairment. Without treatment, reading deficits plateau by one month; compensatory strategies yield modest gains by one year. Red flags include progressive worsening or aphasia, suggesting larger infarcts. Natural history shows stable pure alexia in most survivors beyond six months, requiring targeted rehabilitation to maximize reading skills.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Neuroimaging with non-contrast CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%) per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines. Step 2: MRI brain with DWI, ADC, and FLAIR sequences to localize splenial infarct; DTI can quantify interhemispheric tract integrity (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Visual field testing by automated perimetry to document homonymous hemianopia (per Neuro-Ophthalmology Society 2022 guidelines). Step 4: Language assessment including reading aloud, naming, writing-to-dictation, following AAN 2020 aphasia battery protocols. Step 5: Vascular evaluation with CTA/MRA for posterior circulation stenosis (sensitivity 88%, specificity 92%) per ASA stroke guidelines 2022. Step 6: Echocardiogram to assess for cardioembolic sources with bubble study for PFO if cryptogenic (per ESC 2021 stroke prevention guidelines). Step 7: Laboratory workup including CBC, ESR, CRP, fasting lipids, HbA1c (normal HbA1c <5.7%), coagulation panel, ANA, antiphospholipid antibodies per AAN 2022 recommendations. Step 8: CSF analysis if demyelination is suspected: cell count <5 cells/mm3, protein 15-45 mg/dL normal (per International Panel on MS 2017 criteria).

Aspirin. In a 70-year-old patient with established vascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension), a history of lacunar stroke, patent foramen ovale (PFO), and extracranial atherosclerosis without evidence of high-grade symptomatic carotid stenosis, guideline-based secondary prevention prioritizes antiplatelet therapy over PFO closure or carotid endarterectomy. The AHA/ASA 2014 guidelines recommend single-agent antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 50\u2013325 mg daily) for noncardioembolic ischemic stroke (Class I, Level A). There is no randomized trial evidence supporting PFO closure in patients older than 60 years with nonembolic stroke mechanisms and multiple vascular risk factors (Meier et al., NEJM 2017). Carotid endarterectomy is indicated only for symptomatic stenosis \u226570% (NASCET criteria) (AHA/ASA 2011, Class I). This patient\u2019s CTA shows extracranial atherosclerotic changes but not high-grade stenosis requiring intervention. Aspirin reduces recurrent stroke risk by ~22% vs. placebo (Antithrombotic Trialists\u2019 Collaboration, Lancet 2002).","conceptual_foundation":"Lacunar strokes are small-vessel infarcts resulting from lipohyalinosis or microatheroma of penetrating arteries, commonly in the internal capsule. They fall under ischemic stroke in the ICD-11 classification (8A80.Z) and are considered noncardioembolic. PFO is implicated in cryptogenic stroke when no other etiology is identified, particularly in younger patients. Carotid atherosclerosis causes large-artery atheroembolic strokes when stenosis reaches hemodynamically significant thresholds. Antiplatelet therapy addresses platelet aggregation central to thrombus formation in atherosclerotic and small-vessel disease, whereas PFO closure targets paradoxical embolism and carotid endarterectomy addresses plaque stabilization and removal.","pathophysiology":"Normal arterial endothelium maintains a balance of anti-thrombotic and pro-thrombotic factors. Hypertension and diabetes induce endothelial dysfunction, lipohyalinosis, and microatheroma formation in penetrating arterioles, leading to lacunar infarcts. Atherosclerosis of the extracranial carotid arteries results from lipid deposition, inflammation, and plaque formation. Platelet activation on atheromatous plaques triggers thrombus formation. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 in platelets, reducing thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation by ~50\u201370%.","clinical_manifestation":"Lacunar strokes typically present with pure motor or sensory deficits without cortical signs. Posterior limb internal capsule involvement produces pure contralateral hemiparesis affecting face, arm, and leg. These patients often have gradual onset over minutes to hours. There is no evidence of cortical signs (aphasia, neglect, visual field cut). Carotid atherosclerotic strokes may present with contralateral cortical deficits if embolization occurs. PFO-related strokes often manifest in younger patients without vascular risk factors.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation of ischemic stroke includes noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, vascular imaging (CTA/MRA) to assess large-vessel stenosis, and echocardiography for cardiac sources including PFO. In this patient, CTA shows extracranial atherosclerosis without significant stenosis (>70%). Transesophageal echocardiogram may detect PFO but risk-benefit of closure is unfavorable in older patients with alternative stroke mechanisms. Routine hypercoagulable workup is low-yield in vascular risk patients.","management_principles":"Secondary prevention in noncardioembolic ischemic stroke includes antiplatelet therapy, statin treatment, blood pressure control, and glycemic management. Aspirin (81\u2013325 mg daily) is a Class I recommendation. In patients with high-risk carotid stenosis (\u226570% ipsilateral and symptomatic), carotid endarterectomy is Class I but not indicated here. PFO closure has a Class IIb recommendation in select patients \u226460 years with cryptogenic stroke after thorough evaluation. Lifestyle modifications and risk factor optimization (BP <130/80 mmHg, LDL <70 mg/dL) are essential adjuncts.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up should occur within 2\u20134 weeks of the index event to assess adherence to antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure, lipid levels, and glycemic control. Annual carotid ultrasound may monitor progression of extracranial atherosclerosis if initial plaque burden was moderate (<50% stenosis). Reassessment of stroke recurrence risk and adjustment of therapy should be performed at least yearly or with interim events. Echocardiography is not routinely repeated unless new cardioembolic features develop.","clinical_pearls":"1. In patients >60 years with multiple vascular risk factors and lacunar infarcts, PFO closure is generally not indicated. 2. Carotid endarterectomy benefits accrue only when symptomatic stenosis \u226570% is present; mild to moderate atherosclerosis merits medical therapy. 3. Aspirin remains first-line for noncardioembolic stroke prevention with a number needed to treat of ~40 over 2 years to prevent one stroke. 4. Lacunar strokes often lack cortical signs and represent small-vessel pathology distinct from large-artery embolic strokes. 5. Comprehensive vascular risk factor control (BP, diabetes, lipids) provides additive stroke risk reduction beyond antiplatelet therapy.","references":"1. Kernan WN, et al.

What should be administered?","options":["Vitamin K","Idarucizumab"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Idarucizumab","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B (Idarucizumab) is correct. Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with very high affinity, rapidly neutralizing its anticoagulant effect. In the setting of life-threatening bleeding or urgent procedures, the REVERSE-AD trial (Pollack et al., 2017) demonstrated immediate normalization of dilute thrombin time in 100% of patients following idarucizumab 5 g IV. Option A (Vitamin K) is ineffective against direct thrombin inhibitors, as vitamin K acts by promoting gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factors and does not reverse dabigatran\u2019s mechanism. A common pitfall is to confuse all oral anticoagulant reversal with vitamin K, but current AHA/ASA guidelines (2018) specify idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal.","conceptual_foundation":"Dabigatran is a direct, competitive, reversible thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor approved for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation. Unlike warfarin, which decreases synthesis of vitamin K\u2013dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X, dabigatran directly binds thrombin, preventing fibrinogen cleavage. Understanding the pharmacodynamics underpins why an antibody fragment rather than vitamin K is required for reversal. The REVERSE-AD protocol established idarucizumab\u2019s dosing (2 \u00d7 2.5 g boluses) based on pharmacokinetic modeling of dabigatran binding.","pathophysiology":"Under normal hemostasis, thrombin (factor IIa) converts fibrinogen to fibrin, activates platelets, and amplifies coagulation. Dabigatran inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin, prolonging thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. Idarucizumab binds free and thrombin-bound dabigatran, restoring thrombin activity and enabling rapid clot formation. In the context of reperfusion hemorrhage, rapid neutralization halts further bleeding.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients on dabigatran who undergo mechanical thrombectomy may experience petechial hemorrhages or frank parenchymal hematoma in the reperfused territory. Clinically, this presents with sudden neurological worsening (e.g., new hemiparesis, decreased level of consciousness) within hours of reperfusion. Prompt recognition and reversal are critical to limit hematoma expansion.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of dabigatran-associated hemorrhage relies on neuroimaging (CT/MRI) demonstrating hemorrhage and laboratory assays (dilute thrombin time, ecarin clotting time) to confirm ongoing anticoagulant effect. Point-of-care thrombin time allows rapid bedside assessment. Baseline renal function guides expected drug clearance but cannot replace specific assays for acute management.","management_principles":"Immediate administration of idarucizumab (5 g IV) is recommended (AHA/ASA class I, level B-R). Supportive measures include blood product management (platelets if thrombocytopenic), blood pressure control (target <140 mm Hg systolic), and neurosurgical consultation for hematoma evacuation if indicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"After reversal, monitor vital signs, neurological status, and repeat head CT in 6\u201312 hours to assess hematoma stability. Reassess coagulation parameters (thrombin time) post-idarucizumab. Resume anticoagulation only after hemorrhage is stable and the ischemic risk outweighs bleeding risk, typically several days later.","clinical_pearls":"1. Idarucizumab reverses dabigatran within minutes (100% reversal in REVERSE-AD). 2. Vitamin K has no effect on direct thrombin inhibitors. 3. Always check renal function when interpreting dabigatran levels. 4. Maintain systolic BP <140 mm Hg after hemorrhage. 5. Resume anticoagulation based on hemorrhage stability and stroke recurrence risk.","references":"1. Pollack CV Jr et al. Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal.

What should be done next?","options":["Send home","Repeat digital subtraction angiogram"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Send home","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Send home. In perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (PNSAH), two negative angiograms (CT angiography or digital subtraction angiography) with a classic non-aneurysmal bleed pattern confined to the perimesencephalic cisterns predict an extremely low risk (<1%) of an underlying vascular lesion. The AHA/ASA 2012 guidelines (Class I, Level B) state that no further invasive angiography is needed when high-quality imaging excludes aneurysm in PNSAH. Repeating DSA offers negligible additional yield and subjects the patient to procedural risk. Common misconceptions include repeating angiography as routine; however, only in non-perimesencephalic patterns or when initial studies are suboptimal is repeat DSA indicated, with an incremental detection rate of <2%.","conceptual_foundation":"SAH is classified under ICD-11 8B03.1. PNSAH constitutes ~10% of spontaneous SAH. Perimesencephalic pattern on CT is defined by hemorrhage localized anterior to the pons without extension into the Sylvian fissures or cortical sulci. Differential includes aneurysmal SAH, AVM rupture, dural fistula, or venous sinus thrombosis. Historically, non-aneurysmal SAH was often subjected to repeated angiography until data demonstrated the benign nature of PNSAH.","pathophysiology":"In aneurysmal SAH, rupture of an intracranial aneurysm leads to high-pressure arterial bleeding into the subarachnoid space. In PNSAH, the bleeding source is likely venous or capillary around the basilar artery apex; pathologic mechanisms are poorly understood and do not involve high\u2010pressure arterial rupture. This results in lower subarachnoid blood volume and minimal risk of vasospasm or rebleeding.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PNSAH present with sudden, severe headache (\u201cthunderclap\u201d), often with nausea/vomiting and nuchal rigidity. Unlike aneurysmal SAH, PNSAH has lower rates of focal deficits, seizures, hydrocephalus (<5%), and delayed cerebral ischemia (<1%). Clinical course is benign with excellent prognosis; >95% achieve full functional recovery.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial noncontrast CT identifies SAH and bleed pattern. CT angiography (CTA) with \u226564-slice CT has sensitivity 98% and specificity 100% for intracranial aneurysms >3 mm. DSA remains gold standard (sensitivity ~100%). In PNSAH, if CTA is high quality and consistent with perimesencephalic bleed, DSA may be deferred; if CTA is negative but bleed is atypical, DSA is indicated. Two negative DSAs confirm non-aneurysmal PNSAH, and no further vascular workup is recommended.","management_principles":"Management is supportive: blood pressure control (SBP <160 mm Hg), analgesia, bed rest, and observation. Nimodipine is not routinely indicated given low vasospasm risk but may be considered in symptomatic cases. No need for antifibrinolytics. Admission for 48\u201372 h of monitoring for delayed hydrocephalus or headache control suffices. Discharge planning includes patient education on recurrence risk (<1%) and follow-up noninvasive imaging only if new symptoms arise.","follow_up_guidelines":"After uncomplicated PNSAH with two negative angiograms, outpatient follow-up in 4\u20136 weeks with clinical assessment only\u2014no repeat imaging unless new neurologic symptoms occur. No routine CTA or MRA is recommended (AHA/ASA 2012, Class III: harm if over-imaged). Monitor for headache recurrence; instruct patient about red-flag symptoms warranting immediate evaluation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Perimesencephalic SAH with negative angiograms has benign prognosis\u2014avoid unnecessary repeat DSA. 2. Pattern of hemorrhage on CT (confined to perimesencephalic cisterns) is key to diagnosis. 3. Vasospasm is rare in PNSAH\u2014routine nimodipine is not indicated. 4. CTA with modern CT scanners may obviate the need for DSA in clear PNSAH. 5. Patient education on low rebleeding risk (<1%) reduces anxiety and avoids over-monitoring.","references":"1. Connolly ES Jr et al.
