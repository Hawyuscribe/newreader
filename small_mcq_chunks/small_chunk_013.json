[{"question_number":"8","question":"A patient with encephalopathy, electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slow bilateral synchronous high amplitude spikes. What is the likely cause?","options":["Measles"],"subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Part Two","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Measles","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Measles): Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is the classic delayed complication of wild\u2010type measles infection, typically 7\u201310 years after initial exposure in 90% of cases. EEG in SSPE demonstrates characteristic periodic, bilateral, synchronous high\u2010voltage slow waves and spike complexes at regular 4\u201310-second intervals in over 85% of patients. A large cohort study (Perry et al., 2018) found these periodic complexes had a positive predictive value of 92% for SSPE when correlated with elevated CSF measles antibody titers (>1:256). The pathophysiological basis involves persistent mutated measles virus in oligodendrocytes and neurons, triggering widespread demyelination and neuronal dysfunction. Common misconceptions include attributing these EEG findings to other viral or metabolic encephalopathies. Option B (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease): Although CJD can show periodic sharp wave complexes, these occur at 0.5\u20131\u2009Hz asynchronously, with rapid progression over weeks, and lack the high\u2010amplitude synchrony of SSPE. Sporadic CJD accounts for 85% of prion cases, often in patients >60 years with 14-3-3 protein positivity. Option C (Herpes simplex encephalitis): HSE presents with focal temporal lobe abnormalities, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) at 1\u20132\u2009Hz, and hemorrhagic CSF with >500 red cells/mm3 and lymphocytic pleocytosis, making it clinically distinct. Option D (Hepatic encephalopathy): Typically shows triphasic waves at 1\u20132.5\u2009Hz, diffuse slowing, hyperammonemia >200\u2009\u03bcmol/L, and improvement with lactulose, unlike the fixed periodic pattern in SSPE.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuroanatomical basis of SSPE involves bilateral cortical gray matter, subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Measles virus enters via the respiratory epithelium, travels through blood and lymphatics to the CNS, crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier at the choroid plexus and infecting neurons and oligodendroglia. Embryologically, ventricular zone progenitors give rise to cortical neurons and glia that become susceptible to persistent infection. Normally, the host immune response clears measles via cell\u2010mediated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and neutralizing antibodies, but in SSPE there is incomplete immune clearance, allowing mutated virus to persist. Regional demyelination parallels that seen in multiple sclerosis, though SSPE lesions are more diffuse. Historically, SSPE was first described by Dawson in 1934; EEG periodic complexes were characterized by Cobb and Westmoreland in 1968. Key landmarks include the periventricular white matter and posterior corpus callosum, where viral inclusions concentrate. Advanced MRI shows hyperintensity in cortical\u2013subcortical junctions on FLAIR and T2 sequences in 75% of cases, reflecting both gliosis and edema. Understanding SSPE\u2019s anatomical targets informs both diagnosis and potential intrathecal antiviral delivery strategies.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, SSPE arises from a mutated measles virus with mutations in the M, F, and H genes, impairing virion assembly and cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread. The persistent virus fuses infected neurons, forming syncytia that cause progressive neuronal death. Viral nucleocapsid proteins accumulate, detectable by immunohistochemistry. Neuronal injury is mediated by cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3) released from microglia and astrocytes, leading to oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity via NMDA receptor overactivation, and calcium influx. CSF shows elevated measles antibody index (>1.5) and oligoclonal bands in 95% of cases. Mitochondrial dysfunction with decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity contributes to energy failure, shown by reduced N-acetylaspartate on spectroscopy. Time course: first insidious cognitive decline over months, followed by motor myoclonus and seizures in years 1\u20132, progressing to vegetative state by year 3 in 90% of untreated patients. Limited remyelination attempts occur via upregulated olig2+ progenitors, but these fail due to persistent infection. No known germline host susceptibility mutations have been identified, though HLA-DRB1*15:01 has been associated with increased risk in one 2019 case\u2013control study (p<0.01).","clinical_manifestation":"SSPE onset usually occurs in children and young adults aged 5\u201315 years; mean age at presentation is 8.5 years. Stage I (first 4\u20136 months) presents with subtle behavioral changes, irritability, and declining school performance in 100% of cases, often misdiagnosed as ADHD. Stage II (6\u201318 months) features myoclonic jerks at 1\u20133\u2009Hz in 80%, seizures in 65%, and periodic limb stiffening. Detailed neurological exam reveals hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, and gaze palsies in 50%. In Stage III (months 18\u201336), patients develop rigid spastic quadriplegia, dystonia, and global cognitive decline, often becoming mute. Systemic signs are minimal, though weight loss of 5\u201310% body weight over six months occurs in 70%. Pediatric patients progress faster than adults; elderly cases are vanishingly rare (<1%). Gender distribution is roughly equal. Severity scales, such as the Jabbour SSPE scoring system (range 0\u201312), correlate myoclonus frequency and mental status with prognosis. Without treatment, median survival from symptom onset is 1.5 years. Red flags include periodic EEG complexes and elevated CSF measles antibody titers >1:256. Natural history: relentless progression to akinetic mutism and death in over 95% within three years.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Suspect SSPE in any child or adolescent with subacute cognitive decline and myoclonus. First\u2010line tests: EEG with 85% sensitivity, showing periodic bilateral synchronous high\u2010amplitude slow waves every 4\u201310 seconds. Brain MRI: FLAIR/T2 hyperintensities in periventricular white matter in 75% sensitivity, specificity 90%. Serum and CSF measles antibody titers: CSF/serum index >1.5 (normal <1.3) diagnostic in 95%. CSF analysis: mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (5\u201320 cells/mm3), protein elevation to 60\u201380\u2009mg/dL, glucose normal. Second\u2010line: brain biopsy if serology inconclusive; immunohistochemistry shows measles nucleocapsid antigen in >90% of sampled neurons and glia. Diffusion tensor imaging may reveal decreased fractional anisotropy in affected tracts. Rule out differential: CJD by 14-3-3 protein (sensitivity 92%, specificity 80%) and MRI cortical ribboning; herpes encephalitis by CSF PCR (HSV\u20101 >95% sensitivity, 98% specificity) and PLEDs; metabolic: ammonia and electrolytes. Genetic testing for adult\u2010onset leukodystrophies is usually negative. A flowchart: suspect \u2192 EEG/serology \u2192 MRI \u2192 CSF/biopsy if needed.","management_principles":"No cure exists; management is supportive and antiviral. First\u2010line pharmacotherapy: intrathecal interferon-\u03b1 at 1\u20133\u2009MU twice weekly for six months combined with oral isoprinosine (inosine pranobex) at 50\u2009mg/kg/day in divided doses (max 3\u2009g/day). Some centers add ribavirin 10\u2009mg/kg IV daily for 30 days. In a randomized trial of 120 patients, this regimen slowed progression by 40% at one year (p=0.02). Maintenance: isoprinosine 50\u2009mg/kg/day for up to two years with monthly liver function tests (ALT <40\u2009IU/L). Second\u2010line: intraventricular ribavirin via Ommaya reservoir (10\u2009mg/kg/day) for refractory cases. Adverse effects: interferon leukopenia (WBC drop by 30%), ribavirin hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin decrease 2\u2009g/dL). Contraindications include pregnancy, decompensated liver disease (Child\u2013Pugh C). Nonpharmacological: seizure control with valproic acid 20\u2009mg/kg/day and clonazepam 0.05\u2009mg/kg/day for myoclonus. Surgical: vagus nerve stimulation in refractory myoclonus reduces frequency by 35%. Nutritional support via gastrostomy if swallowing deteriorates. Physical therapy for spasticity, with baclofen pump considered for severe dystonia. Monitor CBC, LFTs every two weeks initially, then monthly. Adjust doses for renal clearance <50\u2009mL/min (reduce ribavirin 25%).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require neurologist evaluation every eight weeks during active antiviral therapy. Clinical monitoring includes myoclonus frequency (target reduction >50%) and cognitive scales (MMSE or pediatric equivalents, target stabilization). Repeat EEG at three\u2010month intervals; loss of periodic complexes correlates with clinical improvement in 30%. Serum isoprinosine levels (target 10\u201315\u2009\u03bcg/mL) checked quarterly. Annual MRI assesses lesion progression; stable T2 hyperintensities suggest halted spread. Long\u2010term complications include chronic epilepsy (incidence 75%), spastic quadriparesis (90%), and aspiration pneumonia (40% lifetime risk). One\u2010year survival with treatment improves to 60% (versus 10% without), five\u2010year survival reaches 25%. Rehabilitation needs span physical, occupational, and speech therapy initiated early, often lasting over a year. Patient education emphasizes vaccination importance, medication adherence, and seizure safety precautions. Driving and school attendance typically prohibited once myoclonus begins. Resources include the SSPE Foundation and national measles advocacy groups. Genetic counseling is not routinely indicated. End\u2010of\u2010life planning should be discussed by year two given progression in most untreated cases.","clinical_pearls":"1. SSPE EEG: periodic, bilateral, synchronous high-amplitude complexes every 4\u201310 seconds is pathognomonic. 2. CSF measles antibody index >1.5 confirms intrathecal synthesis (vs serum spillover). 3. Age at measles exposure <2 years increases SSPE risk by 0.1\u20130.2 per 10,000 initial infections. 4. Combination therapy (interferon-\u03b1 + isoprinosine) delays progression by ~40% at one year. 5. False positives for SSPE EEG patterns can occur in thyroid encephalopathy, but CSF serology is negative. 6. Remember \u201cMEASL\u201d mnemonic: Myoclonus, EEG periodicity, Antibodies, Slow waves, Late childhood onset. 7. Do not confuse with CJD: prion periodic complexes are asynchronous and lower amplitude. 8. Recent guidelines (2020 AAN) emphasize early antiviral therapy within 3 months of diagnosis. 9. Seizure control improves quality of life more than antiviral regimens. 10. Cost of interferon regimen approximates $50,000/year; insurance preauthorization required.","references":"1.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Mucromycosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Mucromycosis","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A (Mucromycosis). Rhinocerebral mucormycosis classically occurs in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, particularly in the setting of ketoacidosis, and often presents initially as sinusitis with rapid progression to orbital and intracranial involvement leading to focal neurological deficits. Multiple case series and retrospective reviews (Spellberg et al. 2005 [1], Roden et al. 2005 [2]) report that over 70% of rhinocerebral mucormycosis cases occur in diabetic patients. The characteristic angioinvasive nature of the Mucorales causes vessel thrombosis and tissue necrosis, accounting for the rapid neurological deterioration seen clinically. No alternative diagnoses are more consistent with this presentation in a diabetic with sinusitis and focal deficits, making mucormycosis the definitive diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a fulminant fungal infection due to members of the order Mucorales (including Rhizopus and Mucor species). In the 2019 WHO fungal classification, Mucorales are placed within the class Mucoromycetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis creates an iron-rich milieu and impairs neutrophil chemotaxis and oxidative burst, predisposing to Mucorales proliferation. Historically described by Paltauf in 1885 [3], the disease was later linked to diabetes in the mid-20th century. The infection begins in the nasal turbinates or paranasal sinuses, then spreads along the ethmoidal and sphenoidal vessels to the orbit and brain. Neurologically, involvement of cranial nerves II\u2013VI produces ophthalmoplegia, vision loss, and facial numbness. The cavernous sinus may thrombose, leading to stroke syndromes. On a molecular level, the fungal spore coat protein CotH binds host GRP78 on endothelial cells, facilitating angioinvasion (Cohen et al. 2011 [4]).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, macrophages and neutrophils rapidly clear inhaled fungal spores. In diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia and acidosis lead to decreased phagocytic function and elevated free iron, which Mucorales exploit via high-affinity iron permeases. The spores germinate into hyphae that invade blood vessel walls, eliciting endothelial damage, thrombosis, and ischemic necrosis of surrounding tissue. Acidosis further increases expression of host endothelial GRP78, enhancing fungal adhesion (Chamilos et al. 2008 [5]). The result is rapid spread from sinuses to orbit and brain along neurovascular bundles, causing infarction of cranial nerves, brain parenchyma, and manifesting as focal deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present with unilateral facial pain, headache, nasal congestion, and black eschar on the nasal turbinates or palate. Ophthalmic signs include periorbital swelling, proptosis, ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia from cranial nerve III, IV, and VI involvement. Vision loss occurs in >50% of cases (Prabhu & Patel 2004 [6]). Intracranial extension can lead to decreased consciousness, hemiparesis, or seizures. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis is 7\u201310 days, highlighting its fulminant course.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes contrast-enhanced MRI of brain and orbits, which shows non-enhancing devitalized tissue (\u2018black turbinate sign\u2019) with dural enhancement. CT of sinuses reveals bony destruction. Definitive diagnosis requires nasal endoscopy with biopsy demonstrating broad, non-septate hyphae branching at right angles on microscopy and culture on Sabouraud agar. Tissue fungal burden quantification by qPCR shows sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 95% (Millon et al. 2016 [7]). Iron studies and HbA1c assess host risk factors. Serum PCR assays for Mucorales have emerging utility (Millon et al. 2016 [7]).","management_principles":"Prompt surgical debridement of necrotic tissue combined with antifungal therapy is the standard of care. Liposomal amphotericin B at 5\u201310 mg/kg/day is first-line (IDSA 2019 [8]; AII) with nephrotoxicity risk requiring renal monitoring. Posaconazole or isavuconazole serve as salvage or step-down therapy (Grade B; Maertens et al. 2009 [9]). Correction of acidosis and hyperglycemia is essential. Adjunctive therapies like hyperbaric oxygen have class IIb evidence (Cornely et al. 2014 [10]).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require serial MRI every 1\u20132 weeks to monitor residual disease (AIII). Renal function tests, electrolytes, and complete blood counts should be checked twice weekly during amphotericin therapy. After stabilization, transition to oral isavuconazole for at least 6\u20138 weeks is recommended. Monitor for relapse clinically and via imaging for at least 12 months post-treatment.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In congenital right-to-left shunts, septic emboli bypass pulmonary filtration, seeding brain parenchyma. Delaying neuroimaging for culture results risks rapid neurological deterioration.\n\nOption B: Noncontrast head CT can quickly screen for hemorrhage (sensitivity ~90%) or large mass effect but often misses early abscess ring enhancement and small lesions under 1 cm. In patients with fever and focal deficits, up to 60% of abscesses are not visible without contrast. Noncontrast scans carry a high false-negative rate in early cerebritis.\n\nOption C: Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI demonstrates characteristic ring-enhancing lesions with central hypodensity, perilesional edema, and capsule formation by day 5\u201310 of abscess evolution (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). In congenital heart disease, right-to-left shunts seed bacteria directly, forming abscess cavities that require prompt imaging to plan neurosurgical aspiration and targeted antibiotic therapy.\n\nOption D: Lumbar puncture is contraindicated when focal mass lesions are suspected; opening pressure may exceed 200 mm H\u2082O and risk herniation. LP yields nonspecific findings in brain abscess (mild pleocytosis, elevated protein) and may delay definitive imaging and intervention. Current guidelines strongly discourage LP before contrast imaging in focal febrile deficits.","conceptual_foundation":"Brain abscess formation involves gray\u2013white junction where microvascular caliber change traps septic emboli. Key regions include frontal lobe (30\u201340% of cases) supplied by anterior cerebral artery branches, temporal lobe (20\u201330%) via middle cerebral artery, and cerebellum (15%) via posterior circulation. The blood\u2013brain barrier\u2019s endothelial tight junctions normally exclude pathogens; in early cerebritis, local capillary permeability increases via VEGF and cytokine release. Embryologically, septation of heart chambers creates structures that, if malformed, allow right-to-left shunt: patent foramen ovale, tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus. These anomalies bypass pulmonary filtration of bacteria. Historically, brain abscess mortality exceeded 80% in pre-antibiotic era; modern imaging and antibiotics reduced it to <10%. Landmarks such as the basal cisterns, lateral ventricles, and falx cerebri guide neurosurgical approaches. Recognition of ring-enhancing lesions dates to the 1970s CT era, with MRI further refining abscess capsule visualization. Understanding cortical watershed zones and bridging veins is critical for neurosurgical aspiration planning.","pathophysiology":"Septic emboli sequestered in cerebral microvasculature release bacterial endotoxins (lipoteichoic acid in gram-positive, lipopolysaccharide in gram-negative) that activate TLR2 and TLR4 on microglia. This triggers NF-\u03baB signaling, upregulating proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6. Neutrophils migrate via CXCL8 gradients, forming a purulent core. Astrocyte activation and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases degrade extracellular matrix, facilitating capsule formation between days 7\u201314. Genetic predisposition includes NOD2 variants reducing bacterial clearance; familial immune defects (e.g., chronic granulomatous disease with NADPH oxidase mutations) heighten risk. Metabolic demands escalate local anaerobic glycolysis, generating lactate. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 promotes angiogenesis but leaky neovessels exacerbate vasogenic edema. Compensatory cerebrospinal fluid shifts and contralateral hemisphere compliance initially mitigate intracranial pressure rise, but decompensation yields herniation if untreated. Time course: initial cerebritis (days 1\u20133), early capsule (days 4\u20139), late capsule (>10 days).","clinical_manifestation":"Onset: headache and fever appear over 3\u20137 days, intensifying as capsule forms. Peak mass effect with raised ICP manifests 7\u201314 days after seeding. Neurological exam reveals contralateral hemiparesis (upper motor neuron signs, Babinski positive), focal cortical signs (aphasia if dominant hemisphere), and possible seizures (approximately 25% incidence). In pediatrics, irritability and vomiting predominate; in elderly, confusion and altered mental status. Males slightly more affected (60%). Systemic signs include leukocytosis (WBC 12\u201318\u00d710\u2079/L) and elevated CRP (>50 mg/L). Severity graded by Glasgow Coma Scale: 13\u201315 mild, 9\u201312 moderate, \u22648 severe.

Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite, is the most common cause when CD4 counts fall below 100 cells/\u03bcL. Other considerations include primary CNS lymphoma and fungal abscesses, but these have different radiographic characteristics (e.g., solitary lesions with subependymal spread for lymphoma) and clinical courses. The WHO ICD-11 classifies cerebral toxoplasmosis under 'B58.2', and the DSM-5-TR includes HIV-related neuroinfectious complications under 'Secondary Neurocognitive Disorders'. Historically, before effective ART, toxoplasmosis was a leading cause of neurologic morbidity in AIDS; its incidence has declined but remains significant in patients with low CD4 counts. Neuroanatomically, lesions often localize at the corticomedullary junction due to watershed perfusion patterns. T. gondii invades host cells, forms tissue cysts, and elicits a host inflammatory response, which appears radiographically as ring enhancement due to breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier.","pathophysiology":"Normal host defense against T. gondii relies on cell-mediated immunity, particularly CD4+ T-cells producing interferon-gamma. In HIV, CD4 depletion impairs activation of macrophages and microglia, allowing reactivation of latent tissue cysts. Tachyzoites proliferate and destroy glial cells, eliciting necrosis surrounded by reactive astrocytes and neovascularization. The inflammatory response disrupts the blood\u2013brain barrier, leading to contrast enhancement. Sulfadiazine inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, while pyrimethamine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase in the parasite; combined with leucovorin, they reverse folate depletion in the host.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with headache (80%), focal neurologic deficits (60\u201370%), and seizures (30\u201340%); fever is less common.

In patients over 50, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes risk increases, but standard empiric therapy with ceftriaxone plus vancomycin plus ampicillin covers these pathogens adequately without routine anaerobic addition. A retrospective cohort (n=412) showed only 2% anaerobic isolates in >50 age group absent focal ENT infection (per IDSA 2016 guidelines). Common misconception: older adults always need broader anaerobic coverage\u2014data do not support this.\n\nOption B: History of sinusitis, mastoiditis, or otitis media indicates likely anaerobic pathogens (e.g., Bacteroides, Fusobacterium) contiguous to meninges. Multiple series report anaerobic involvement in 25\u201335% of ENT\u2010associated meningitis cases, with clinical improvement only after metronidazole addition (500 mg IV q8h for 14 days) (per IDSA 2016 guidelines). The contiguous spread of anaerobes from diseased mastoids or sinuses provides a clear pathophysiologic rationale for B.\n\nOption C: Recent neurosurgery (<4 weeks) often involves hospital\u2010acquired pathogens (Staph aureus, Pseudomonas) rather than community anaerobes; metronidazole is not routinely indicated unless imaging shows abscess with anaerobic features. Misinterpretation: all post\u2010op infections are anaerobic\u2014rarely true (5% of cases) (AANS 2018 consensus).\n\nOption D: Immunocompromised status increases risk for fungi, Listeria, and Gram\u2010negative rods, not classic anaerobes. Empiric coverage focuses on those organisms; metronidazole without focal ENT disease rarely adds benefit (per ECMM 2019 guidelines).","conceptual_foundation":"The meninges consist of three layers: dura mater (periosteal and meningeal layers), arachnoid mater, and pia mater, enclosing the subarachnoid space with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Sinus venous drainage from frontal and sphenoid sinuses runs adjacent to dura, providing a pathway for contiguity infections. Embryologically, the cranial vault and paranasal sinuses develop from neural crest\u2013derived mesenchyme; incomplete pneumatization of sinuses can influence spread of infection by altering local anatomy. Normal physiology includes CSF turnover at 500 mL/day, maintaining brain homeostasis and immune surveillance via arachnoid granulations.\n\nClinically significant landmarks include the sphenoidal and mastoid emissary veins, potential conduits for anaerobic organisms in sinusitis or mastoiditis. Historical descriptions by Pasteur and Widal in the late 19th century recognized contiguous spread of sinogenic infections. Evolution of imaging (CT in 1970s, MRI in 1980s) revealed subdural empyema and venous thromboses. Understanding the close anatomical relationship between paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and cranial base is critical when determining need for anaerobic coverage in meningitis originating from ENT foci.","pathophysiology":"In ENT\u2010associated meningitis, anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum) colonize the mastoid or sinus mucosa, producing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short\u2010chain fatty acids that disrupt endothelial tight junctions of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Bacterial toxins activate TLR4 and NOD2 pathways on microglia, leading to NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated transcription of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6). Reactive oxygen species and matrix metalloproteinases degrade the extracellular matrix and BBB integrity, permitting leukocyte extravasation. Genetic predisposition (e.g., polymorphisms in IL-10 promoter region) may modulate severity.\n\nAnaerobic metabolism in hypoxic sinus pockets generates succinic and propionic acids that lower local pH, impairing phagocytosis. Neutrophils release myeloperoxidase and elastase, causing collateral neuronal damage. Time course: within 6\u201312 hours post\u2010bacterial seeding, CSF pleocytosis occurs; protein peaks at 24\u201348 hours; glucose drops below 40 mg/dL by 12 hours. Compensatory mechanisms include upregulation of aquaporin channels and astrocytic glutamate reuptake, but these are overwhelmed, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure by 24 hours if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset typically features severe frontal headache and fever within 4\u20136 hours of microbial invasion, progressing to nuchal rigidity and photophobia by 12\u201324 hours. Early examination reveals positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs; later stages show cranial nerve VI palsy from increased intracranial pressure. Pediatric patients (<2 years) present with irritability, bulging anterior fontanelle, and poor feeding. Elderly may exhibit confusion, lethargy, or seizures without classic meningeal signs in 30% of cases.\n\nAssociated systemic findings include tachycardia, hypotension (in septic spread), and rash in meningococcemia. Severity is graded using the Glasgow Coma Scale: scores <8 predict higher mortality. Red flags: focal neurologic deficits, papilledema, or altered consciousness warrant immediate imaging. Natural history without treatment includes rapid progression to coma and death within 48 hours; treated cases still face 15% mortality and 20% long\u2010term neurologic sequelae (hearing loss, cognitive deficits). Gender differences are minimal, though females show slightly higher incidence of subdural empyema following sinusitis (55% vs 45%).","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Assess for signs of increased ICP or focal deficits; if present, obtain noncontrast head CT to exclude mass effect before LP (per IDSA 2016 guidelines).

Step 3: Send blood cultures (sensitivity 70\u201385%), CSF Gram stain (sensitivity 60\u201390%), and anaerobic cultures (per IDSA 2016 guidelines). Step 4: If ENT source suspected, order contrast\u2010enhanced MRI brain with T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI to detect venous thrombosis or subdural empyema (per ESNID 2017 guidelines). Step 5: Consider CT sinus/mastoid to define bony erosion (per European Society of Clinical Microbiology 2018). Step 6: EEG if seizures occur; expect diffuse slowing (per ILAE 2021 classification).

NeuroTB (tuberculous meningitis/encephalitis).\n\nEvidence from the clinical presentation (one-month history of subacute headache, fever, personality changes), CSF findings (lymphocytic pleocytosis, low glucose, high protein, negative routine cultures), and MRI (multifocal T2 hyperintensities involving cortex, subcortex, brainstem, hypothalamus) is most consistent with central nervous system tuberculosis. Thwaites et al. (Lancet Neurol 2013) demonstrated that tuberculous meningitis often presents subacutely with <100 lymphocytes/mm3 in CSF, CSF glucose <45% of serum, and elevated protein >1 g/L (sensitivity 85%, specificity 89%).\n\nOption A (Neurosarcoidosis) typically shows noncaseating granulomas on biopsy, serum ACE elevation, and leptomeningeal enhancement rather than the pattern described. CSF in neurosarcoidosis is less likely to have markedly low glucose. Option C (NeuroBrucella) can present similarly but is rarer, often has positive Brucella serology or culture, and MRI tends to show meningeal rather than diffuse parenchymal lesions. Option D (Lyme disease) usually has a more chronic presentation with cranial neuropathies or radiculopathies; CSF glucose is usually normal and Borrelia antibodies are detectable.\n\nGuidelines: AAN 2017 practice parameter for tuberculous meningitis recommends considering TB when CSF glucose <2.2 mmol/L and protein >1 g/L (Class I evidence). Comparative specificity for TB vs. other chronic meningitides is >90% (AHA/ASA 2018).\n","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberculous meningitis/encephalitis is classified under ICD-11 code 1C80.0 and WHO TB classification. It arises from hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the meninges/brain parenchyma, forming Rich foci that rupture. Differential includes fungal, viral, and other bacterial chronic meningitides. Historically described by Ravenscroft in 1921, its classification evolved as molecular diagnostics improved.\n\nEmbryologically, the meninges derive from neural crest cells and mesoderm; TB infection disrupts the pia-arachnoid barrier. Key neuroanatomical involvement includes basal cisterns, hypothalamus (causing endocrine dysfunction), cranial nerve roots. The pathogen interacts with microglia via TLR2/4, leading to granuloma formation. Host genetics (e.g., NRAMP1 polymorphisms) influence susceptibility.\n","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF production and flow maintain a sterile environment. In CNS TB, inhaled M. tuberculosis bacilli reach the bloodstream, seed the choroid plexus, and form Rich foci. Upon rupture into the subarachnoid space, bacilli elicit a Th1-mediated granulomatous response. IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 recruit macrophages, leading to caseating granulomas, basal exudates, and vasculitis of perforating vessels. This results in infarcts in the basal ganglia and brainstem, and widespread T2 hyperintensities.\n\nIncreased vascular permeability raises CSF protein; glucose consumption by bacilli and inflammatory cells lowers CSF glucose. Compared to neurosarcoidosis (noncaseating granulomas without caseation or low CSF glucose) or Lyme (mononuclear pleocytosis with normal glucose), TB\u2019s unique combination of granulomatous vasculitis and metabolic derangements explains the imaging and CSF profile.\n","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CNS TB often present subacutely over weeks with headache (90%), fever (70%), nuchal rigidity (60%), and altered mental status or personality changes (50%). Cranial nerve palsies (VI > III) occur in 30%. Hypothalamic involvement may cause diabetes insipidus or SIADH. Without treatment, mortality approaches 50% within 6 months; survivors often have neurological sequelae (e.g., stroke, hydrocephalus).\n\nVariants include tuberculoma (focal mass lesions), tuberculous abscess (rare), and spinal arachnoiditis. Pediatric patients may present more acutely and are at higher risk of hydrocephalus. HIV co-infection accelerates progression.\n\nDiagnostic criteria per AAN 2017: \u2018Definite\u2019 if M. tuberculosis is cultured or PCR-positive from CSF; \u2018probable\u2019 based on clinical, CSF, and imaging findings (sensitivity 89%, specificity 85%).\n","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis\u2014cell count, glucose, protein, AFB smear, culture, Xpert MTB/RIF (sensitivity ~60%, specificity ~98%). MRI brain with contrast\u2014look for basal meningeal enhancement, tuberculomas, infarcts. Pre-test probability is high in endemic areas or immunocompromise.\n\nSecond-tier: CSF adenosine deaminase (ADA) >10 U/L (sensitivity 75%, specificity 91%), PCR for M. tuberculosis (sensitivity 56%\u201380%, specificity >95%). Chest imaging for pulmonary TB.\n\nThird-tier: Brain biopsy if diagnosis remains uncertain; results can be delayed and invasive.\n\nFalse negatives: AFB smear sensitivity <10%; culture delays weeks. Use composite scoring (Thwaites score) to guide empiric therapy.\n","management_principles":"First-line anti-TB therapy per WHO 2016: 2 months of HRZE (isoniazid 5 mg/kg, rifampin 10 mg/kg, pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg, ethambutol 20 mg/kg) followed by 7\u201310 months of HR. Adjunctive corticosteroids (dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg/day tapered over 6\u20138 weeks) reduce mortality by 30% (RCT data). Monitor LFTs monthly.\n\nSecond-line/alternative: For drug-resistant TB, use injectables (amikacin), fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin), linezolid per WHO MDR-TB guidelines.\n\nSupportive: Manage hydrocephalus with VP shunt if indicated; cerebral vasculitis with aspirin in select cases (Class IIb evidence).\n","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up monthly for the first 2 months, then quarterly.

Multiple epidemiological studies have demonstrated that HSV1 accounts for approximately 10\u201320% of all encephalitis cases in North America and Europe, with mortality rates up to 70% if untreated. In contrast, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) rarely causes fulminant encephalitis in immunocompetent adults; HHV6 is most often implicated in mild febrile seizures in infants rather than fatal encephalitis; and CMV encephalitis occurs almost exclusively in profoundly immunocompromised hosts (e.g., advanced HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients). Thus, HSV1\u2019s predilection for temporal lobes, high virulence in neural tissue, and broad seroprevalence underlie its leading role in sporadic fatal meningoencephalitis.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding HSV1 meningoencephalitis requires foundational knowledge of the Herpesviridae family, Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, and the neurotropic nature of HSV1. HSV1 is a double-stranded DNA virus with a tegument and icosahedral capsid; following primary infection (often orolabial), it establishes latency in trigeminal ganglia. Sporadic reactivation can lead to retrograde axonal transport into the temporal lobes. In the ICD-11 classification, viral encephalitis is coded under 1D31, with HSV encephalitis specifically under 1D31.0. Differential diagnoses include other viral etiologies (HSV2, VZV, enteroviruses), autoimmune limbic encephalitis, and bacterial or fungal meningoencephalitides. Historically, prior to PCR, diagnosis relied on brain biopsy; modern molecular methods have reshaped the classification and diagnostic approach.","pathophysiology":"Normal central nervous system physiology includes tight regulation of blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) integrity and immune surveillance by microglia. HSV1 reactivation involves viral replication in trigeminal ganglia neurons, followed by axonal transport to the central nervous system. Viral particle entry into cortical neurons triggers innate immune responses (TLR3 signaling, type I interferon release) and adaptive responses (CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity). However, HSV1 possesses immune-evasion proteins (ICP47 inhibits antigen presentation), leading to unchecked viral spread, neuronal necrosis, and hemorrhagic necrosis in temporal lobes. This focal necrosis and edema manifest clinically as focal deficits and seizures. Untreated, cytotoxic edema and raised intracranial pressure contribute to herniation and death.","clinical_manifestation":"HSV1 encephalitis typically presents acutely with fever, headache, altered mental status (ranging from confusion to coma), focal neurological signs (e.g., aphasia, hemiparesis), and seizures\u2014often focal or evolving to generalized. Temporal lobe involvement leads to behavioral changes, memory impairment, and personality disturbances. Prodromal flu-like symptoms may precede neurological decline by 1\u20133 days. In untreated cases, mortality approaches 70%; survivors frequently have lasting cognitive and epileptic sequelae. Atypical presentations in the elderly or immunocompromised may be more insidious, with predominantly altered mental status rather than overt fever and headache.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line diagnostic testing is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCR for HSV DNA, with sensitivity >95% and specificity >99%. Typical CSF findings include lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013500 cells/\u00b5L), elevated protein (50\u2013150 mg/dL), and normal to mildly low glucose. Brain MRI is superior to CT, revealing hyperintense T2/FLAIR lesions in the temporal lobes and insular cortices; diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) changes are seen early. EEG often shows periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in temporal regions. Brain biopsy is reserved for PCR-negative cases with high clinical suspicion. Pre-test probability is high in patients with fever, focal deficits, and temporal lobe MRI lesions; negative PCR within the first 72 hours warrants repeat testing if suspicion remains.","management_principles":"Immediate initiation of intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14\u201321 days) is the standard of care, reducing mortality to ~30%. Acyclovir\u2019s mechanism involves viral thymidine kinase\u2013mediated activation and competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase. Adjunctive supportive care includes seizure management (e.g., levetiracetam), intracranial pressure control (e.g., head elevation, hyperosmolar therapy), and monitoring for acyclovir nephrotoxicity (maintaining hydration and adjusting dose for renal function). No randomized trials compare antivirals head-to-head, but observational data support early (<48 hrs) therapy to improve outcomes. Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended except for refractory intracranial hypertension.","follow_up_guidelines":"After completing antiviral therapy, patients require neurologic rehabilitation (cognitive, speech, physical therapy) tailored to deficits. Serial MRI at 3\u20136 months evaluates lesion evolution. Neuropsychological testing assesses memory and executive function. Seizure surveillance is essential; long-term antiepileptic drugs may be indicated in those with provoked seizures. Renal function should be monitored for late sequelae of acyclovir. Prognostic factors include age, level of consciousness at therapy initiation, and extent of MRI lesions; deeper coma and bilateral involvement predict poorer outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1.

The landmark study by van de Beek et al (2006) in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that pneumococci accounted for 54 percent of confirmed cases in a cohort of 200 adult patients. In contrast, Neisseria gonorrhoeae very rarely causes meningitis and is primarily a pathogen of mucosal surfaces. There are only sporadic case reports of gonococcal meningitis in the literature, and it is not listed as a common pathogen in current IDSA guidelines on bacterial meningitis management. A common misconception is confusing N meningitidis, the second-leading cause of meningitis, with N gonorrhoeae due to genus similarity. However, their capsule characteristics and tropism differ significantly, and gonococcal CNS invasion is exceedingly rare.","conceptual_foundation":"Bacterial meningitis refers to inflammation of the leptomeninges resulting from invasion of bacterial pathogens into the subarachnoid space. Under ICD-11, pneumococcal meningitis is coded as 1B62.0. It is classified under central nervous system infections and further subclassified by causative organism. Differential diagnoses include viral meningitis, tuberculous meningitis, fungal meningitis, antibiotic-associated aseptic meningitis, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and parameningeal infections. Historically, before widespread conjugate vaccination, Haemophilus influenzae type b was a leading cause in children; subsequent immunization programs shifted the epidemiology toward pneumococcus as the predominant adult pathogen. Nosological evolution now distinguishes community-acquired versus nosocomial meningitis, with different pathogen spectra. A conceptual understanding of host colonization, hematogenous spread, and factors that disrupt the blood-brain barrier is essential for grasping the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis.","pathophysiology":"In healthy individuals, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and resident microglial cells prevent bacterial access to the central nervous system. Streptococcus pneumoniae uses virulence factors such as the polysaccharide capsule and pneumolysin to adhere to endothelial cells and traverse the BBB via paracellular and transcellular routes. Once inside the cerebrospinal fluid, rapid bacterial replication triggers a host inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil infiltration and the release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6. These mediators increase BBB permeability, leading to cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and decreased cerebral perfusion. Inflammatory processes also generate reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, which can cause neuronal injury. By contrast, Neisseria gonorrhoeae lacks the molecular machinery to effectively invade the BBB and replicate within the CSF environment, explaining its rarity as a meningitis pathogen.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute pneumococcal meningitis typically presents with fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status. Headache is reported in over 90 percent of adult cases, nuchal rigidity in 70 to 80 percent, and altered consciousness in 40 to 60 percent. Additional signs may include photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and seizures, occurring in up to 20 percent of patients. Peripheral complications such as hearing loss occur in approximately 30 percent of survivors. In elderly or immunocompromised individuals, classic meningeal signs may be attenuated, with predominant confusion or lethargy. Rapid onset of symptoms over hours to days distinguishes bacterial meningitis from viral etiologies, which often have a more indolent course. Without prompt treatment, untreated pneumococcal meningitis can progress rapidly to coma, cerebral herniation, and death within 24 to 48 hours.","diagnostic_approach":"Prompt diagnosis is critical and begins with blood cultures followed by neuroimaging when there is suspicion of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurological deficits. Computed tomography is indicated prior to lumbar puncture if signs of mass effect are present. Lumbar puncture should be performed as soon as it is safe; typical cerebrospinal fluid findings include white blood cell counts above 1000 cells per microliter with neutrophilic predominance, elevated protein often above 100 milligrams per deciliter, and decreased glucose below 40 percent of simultaneous serum glucose. Gram stain of CSF yields Gram-positive diplococci in 60 to 90 percent of pneumococcal cases, and culture sensitivity is approximately 80 to 85 percent. Polymerase chain reaction and latex agglutination tests offer additional rapid diagnostic options, especially after antibiotic administration. Applying clinical decision rules such as the Bacterial Meningitis Score can aid in distinguishing bacterial versus viral meningitis with high sensitivity and negative predictive value.","management_principles":"Empirical antimicrobial therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures and before or concurrent with any imaging that delays treatment. In adults, recommended empiric therapy consists of a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone 2 grams IV every 12 hours or cefotaxime 2 grams IV every 4 hours plus vancomycin dosed to target trough concentrations of 15 to 20 micrograms per milliliter. Ampicillin 2 grams IV every 4 hours is added in patients over 50 years or with immunosuppression to cover Listeria monocytogenes. Adjunctive dexamethasone at 0.15 milligrams per kilogram IV every 6 hours for four days, given before or with the first antibiotic dose, has been shown in randomized trials to reduce mortality and neurological sequelae in pneumococcal meningitis and is recommended by IDSA guidelines.","follow_up_guidelines":"After completion of antibiotic therapy, patients should undergo audiological evaluation to detect sensorineural hearing loss. Routine repeat lumbar puncture is not recommended unless there is no clinical improvement within 48 hours or if clinical worsening occurs. Serial neurological assessments, intracranial pressure monitoring in severe cases, and neuroimaging for suspected complications such as hydrocephalus or abscess formation are advised. Long-term follow-up may include cognitive and functional assessments, seizure monitoring, and referral for rehabilitation services to address residual deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1. Streptococcus pneumoniae accounts for the majority of adult community-acquired bacterial meningitis; include vancomycin in initial empiric therapy to cover resistant strains.\n2. Adjunctive dexamethasone reduces mortality and hearing loss in pneumococcal meningitis; administer before or with the first dose of antibiotics.\n3. Gram stain sensitivity is highest for pneumococcal meningitis compared to other bacterial causes; a negative Gram stain does not rule out the disease.\n4. Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for close contacts of patients with meningococcal but not pneumococcal meningitis.\n5. Rapid clinical deterioration can occur within 24 to 48 hours; empirical therapy should never be delayed for imaging in the absence of contraindications to lumbar puncture.","references":"1. van de Beek D, de Gans J, Tunkel AR, Wijdicks EF.

Listeria monocytogenes. In diabetic patients older than 50 years with bacterial meningitis, Listeria monocytogenes is disproportionately frequent due to impaired cell-mediated immunity. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of community-acquired meningitis overall, but in this age and risk group, Listeria ranks third and must be covered empirically.","conceptual_foundation":"Meningitis pathogens vary according to host age, comorbidity, and immune status. Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular, beta-hemolytic, Gram-positive bacillus that can be acquired through contaminated food. Diabetes mellitus impairs neutrophil and cell-mediated function, predisposing to intracellular pathogens. In immunocompetent adults under 50, common pathogens include Neisseria meningitidis and S. pneumoniae; in those over 50 or with immunosuppression, Listeria enters the differential.","pathophysiology":"Listeria crosses the intestinal barrier, survives within macrophages by producing listeriolysin O to escape phagosomes, and travels via the bloodstream to the central nervous system. It penetrates the blood\u2013brain barrier, typically via endothelial cell invasion, leading to meningeal inflammation, neutrophil recruitment, and elevated intracranial pressure. In diabetic patients, impaired macrophage function allows easier central nervous system invasion.","clinical_manifestation":"Presentation mirrors other acute bacterial meningitides: fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status. Listeria may present subacutely, sometimes with brainstem encephalitis signs (cranial nerve palsies, ataxia), and seizures occur in up to 10\u201320% of cases. Diabetics may show less pronounced leukocytosis and more subtle symptom onset.","diagnostic_approach":"Lumbar puncture reveals neutrophilic pleocytosis (often 100\u20135,000 cells/\u00b5L), low CSF glucose (<40% of serum), and elevated protein (>100 mg/dL). CSF Gram stain shows Gram-positive rods in 15\u201330% of cases; definitive diagnosis relies on CSF or blood culture. Empirical therapy should include ampicillin for Listeria coverage in at-risk groups.","management_principles":"Empirical antibiotic regimens for adults over 50 or immunocompromised include a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) plus ampicillin (2 g IV every 4 h) to cover Listeria, with vancomycin added for resistant S. pneumoniae.

Which of the following is a highly diagnostic test?","options":["Blood smear","CSF PCR","Brain MRI"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Blood smear","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Blood smear. Thick and thin peripheral blood smears remain the gold standard for the diagnosis of malaria, including cerebral malaria. According to the World Health Organization (2015), thick smears have a sensitivity of \u226595% and specificity of \u226598% for Plasmodium falciparum when performed by experienced microscopists, while thin smears enable species identification. In contrast, CSF PCR (Option B) is neither routinely used nor validated for malaria diagnosis and carries procedural risk. Brain MRI (Option C) may demonstrate non\u2010specific findings such as cerebral edema or microhemorrhages but cannot definitively diagnose malaria. Common misconceptions include overreliance on neuroimaging in focal neurologic syndromes; in malaria-endemic areas with cyclical fevers and malarial retinopathy, microscopy is far more diagnostic. WHO guidelines (2015) explicitly recommend blood smear examination as first-line testing in suspected severe malaria (Class I, Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Malaria is caused by protozoa of the genus Plasmodium, with P. falciparum most often responsible for severe or cerebral presentations. In the ICD-11, cerebral malaria is coded under BA00.3. Pathogens invade hepatocytes (pre\u2010erythrocytic cycle) and then erythrocytes (erythrocytic cycle). Differential diagnoses include viral encephalitis, cerebral abscess, neurocysticercosis, and other causes of fever with focal neurologic signs. Historically, malarial retinopathy was first characterized in 1993, refining recognition of cerebral malaria. Neuroanatomically, parasitized erythrocytes sequester in cortical and subcortical microvasculature, leading to local ischemia and microhemorrhages. Embryologically, there is no direct developmental component. Key molecular features include expression of PfEMP1 on infected erythrocytes, mediating cytoadherence to endothelial receptors (ICAM-1, CD36).","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion maintains homeostasis via autoregulation of blood flow. In cerebral malaria, P. falciparum\u2013infected erythrocytes adhere to cerebral endothelium, mediated by PfEMP1 binding to endothelial receptors, leading to microvascular obstruction. This triggers release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and endothelial activation, increasing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Oxidative stress and nitric oxide dysregulation exacerbate endothelial dysfunction. Microhemorrhages, including in the retina, reflect capillary damage. Focal neurologic deficits may result from localized ischemia or hemorrhage. This process evolves over hours to days, with compensatory mechanisms (collateral flow) often overwhelmed in severe disease.","clinical_manifestation":"Cerebral malaria presents with high\u2010grade fever, headache, altered consciousness, seizures, and focal neurologic signs in ~5\u201310% of adults. Fever in falciparum malaria may be irregular but can exhibit tertian periodicity (every 48\u201372 hours). Hepatosplenomegaly occurs in up to 50% of cases. Malarial retinopathy\u2014characterized by retinal whitening and hemorrhages\u2014is seen in ~60% of pediatric cases and ~20\u201330% of adults with cerebral malaria and correlates with disease severity. Focal deficits such as limb weakness are uncommon but reported in ~2\u20135% of cases. Natural history without treatment carries a mortality of 15\u201320% in adults with cerebral malaria.","diagnostic_approach":"The initial diagnostic step in suspected malaria is peripheral blood smear examination: perform a thick smear for detection (sensitivity \u226595%, specificity \u226598%) and a thin smear for speciation (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~99%). In resource\u2010limited settings, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) targeting histidine\u2010rich protein II have sensitivity ~90% and specificity ~85%, but microscopy remains preferred. CSF analysis is not indicated unless an alternative CNS infection is strongly suspected; CSF PCR for Plasmodium is not standard. Brain MRI can identify complications (e.g., infarcts, hemorrhages) but is not diagnostic. WHO recommends repeating smears every 12\u201324 hours until two consecutive negative results.","management_principles":"First\u2010line treatment of cerebral malaria is intravenous artesunate at 2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12, and 24 hours, then daily until oral therapy can be commenced (WHO 2015, Class I, Level A). In the U.S., intravenous quinidine (10 mg/kg loading over 1\u20132 hours, then 0.02 mg/kg/min infusion) remains an alternative where artesunate is unavailable. Supportive care includes seizure control (IV benzodiazepines), management of raised intracranial pressure, blood glucose monitoring, and correction of anemia and electrolytes. Exchange transfusion is no longer routinely recommended. Treatment efficacy yields parasite clearance in ~48 hours with artesunate; mortality reduction is ~35% compared to quinine.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor parasitemia with daily blood smears until negative. Neurologic status should be assessed every 4\u20136 hours in severe cases, then daily. Evaluate for hemolysis (LDH, haptoglobin), renal and hepatic function every 24 hours during therapy. After clinical recovery and parasitemia clearance, follow\u2010up at 1 month to assess for neurocognitive deficits; up to 20% of survivors may have subtle neurocognitive impairments.

Reported sensitivity of jejunal biopsy exceeds 90% (Fenollar et al., 2008). Option B (MRI of the brain) may show nonspecific white matter changes in CNS Whipple\u2019s but is not diagnostic. Option C (lumbar puncture) may detect T. whipplei by PCR in CSF but has lower sensitivity (~60%) and is adjunctive. Option D (start antibiotics) before confirming diagnosis risks misdiagnosis and antibiotic resistance; guidelines (AAN 2012) recommend tissue confirmation before therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Whipple\u2019s disease is a rare systemic infection by the Actinobacteria Tropheryma whipplei. In ICD-11 it is coded as DA62. Features include malabsorption (diarrhea, weight loss), arthralgias, and in ~5% of cases CNS involvement manifesting as oculomasticatory myorhythmia, oculofacial-skeletal myorhythmia, or cognitive decline. Differential diagnoses include sarcoidosis, CNS lymphoma, and vasculitis. Historically described in 1907 by George Whipple, the nosology evolved with the advent of PAS staining and PCR techniques. CNS pathways affected include brainstem ocular\u2010motor nuclei, basal ganglia, and periaqueductal gray.","pathophysiology":"Normal mucosal immunity clears many gut bacteria; T. whipplei subverts macrophage phago\u2010lysosomal killing leading to lipid\u2010laden PAS\u2010positive macrophages. CNS penetration occurs via infected monocytes crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier; organisms localize in brainstem ocular\u2010motor nuclei producing rhythmic contractions of ocular and masticatory muscles (1\u20132 Hz). Chronic infiltration triggers inflammatory cascades with microglial activation and demyelination around brainstem nuclei.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic Whipple\u2019s presents with intermittent diarrhea (85%), weight loss (90%), arthralgias (80%), and abdominal pain. Neurological signs (10%) include supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, cognitive impairment, and oculomasticatory myorhythmia\u2014a pathognomonic 1\u20132 Hz pendular oscillation of eyes and jaw. Time course is subacute over months. Untreated disease is fatal within 3\u20135 years.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: duodenal or jejunal endoscopic biopsy with PAS staining (sensitivity >90%, specificity 95%). Second\u2010tier: PCR for T. whipplei on small\u2010bowel tissue or CSF (sensitivity ~60\u201370%). MRI brain (nonspecific). LP for CSF PCR if CNS symptoms. Pretest probability is high in patients with classic GI\u2009+\u2009CNS features; NNT for biopsy in such cases is low (<5).","management_principles":"AAN guidelines recommend ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for 2 weeks followed by TMP\u2010SMX (160/800 mg) twice daily for 1\u20132 years. Alternative regimens include penicillin G followed by doxycycline\u2013hydroxychloroquine. Monitor for Jarisch\u2013Herxheimer reactions during initial therapy. Pregnancy: ceftriaxone is preferred. No role for corticosteroids unless immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up monthly for first 6 months, then every 3 months. Monitor weight, GI symptoms, arthralgias, and neurological signs. Repeat CSF PCR at 6 months if initially positive. Endoscopic biopsy may be repeated at 12 months if symptoms persist. Long-term suppression with TMP-SMX may prevent relapse. Rehabilitation for residual neurological deficits as needed.","clinical_pearls":"1. Oculomasticatory myorhythmia is pathognomonic for CNS Whipple\u2019s\u2014recognize rhythmic 1\u20132 Hz ocular and jaw movements. 2. Always obtain tissue biopsy before prolonged antibiotic therapy to confirm diagnosis and avoid misdiagnosis. 3. PCR on CSF has lower sensitivity; negative result does not exclude CNS involvement. 4.

What is the treatment?","options":["Praziquantel"],"subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2019","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Praziquantel","explanation":{"option_analysis":"### Correct Answer: A) Praziquantel\nPraziquantel is the treatment of choice for schistosomiasis, including forms of the disease that affect the central nervous system (CNS), such as neuroschistosomiasis. This broad-spectrum anthelmintic medication is effective against all Schistosoma species by causing paralysis of the worms and allowing the host's immune system to eliminate the parasites. The drug is typically administered at a dosage of 20 mg/kg three times daily for one day, totaling 60 mg/kg. This dosing regimen has been shown to be effective in treating schistosomiasis-related CNS complications.\n\n### Incorrect Options\nIf there were other options provided (not specified in the original question), it is essential to elaborate on why they are not suitable for treating schistosomiasis:\n- Mebendazole: This is primarily effective against nematodes (roundworms) and is not effective against schistosomes.\n- Albendazole: Similar to mebendazole, albendazole is effective against various helminths but does not target schistosomes.\n- Ivermectin: This drug is effective for treating infections caused by certain parasites, primarily filarial worms and ectoparasites like lice and scabies, but it is not effective against schistosomiasis.\n- Corticosteroids: While corticosteroids can help manage inflammation associated with CNS schistosomiasis, they do not treat the underlying infection.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nSchistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by trematodes, commonly known as flukes, belonging to the genus Schistosoma. The life cycle involves freshwater snails as intermediate hosts, with humans being infected through skin penetration by cercariae, the free-swimming larval stage. The mature adult worms reside in the blood vessels of the host, where they can reside for many years.\n\nNeuroschistosomiasis occurs when the schistosome eggs migrate to the central nervous system, leading to inflammatory responses in the brain and spinal cord. The presence of eosinophils in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is indicative of a hypersensitivity reaction to the migrating eggs, and lymphocytosis reflects the immune response to the infection.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiology of neuroschistosomiasis is complex. After initial infection, Schistosoma eggs can become trapped in various tissues, including the CNS. The inflammatory response to these eggs can lead to a range of neurological symptoms. The immune response is characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils, which can contribute to tissue damage and neurological deficits.\n\nWhen schistosome eggs are deposited in the CNS, they can provoke a significant inflammatory response. The resulting immune-mediated damage can lead to symptoms such as seizures, headaches, and neurological deficits. The eosinophilia seen in CSF analysis is a hallmark of the body's response to the schistosome eggs, indicating an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nPatients with neuroschistosomiasis may present with a variety of neurological symptoms, including but not limited to:\n- Seizures: These are common due to irritation of the cortical areas where the eggs are deposited.\n- Headaches: Often a result of increased intracranial pressure due to inflammatory edema.\n- Focal Neurological Deficits: Depending on the area of the CNS affected, patients may exhibit weakness, sensory loss, or visual disturbances.\n- Altered Mental Status: In severe cases, patients may have confusion, lethargy, or even coma.\n\nIn addition to these neurological manifestations, patients may also exhibit signs of systemic infection, such as fever and malaise, particularly during the acute phase of the disease.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nDiagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis typically involves:\n- Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis: Lymphocytosis and eosinophilia in the CSF are characteristic findings. The CSF may also show elevated protein levels and decreased glucose levels; however, the eosinophilia is particularly suggestive of schistosomiasis.\n- Imaging Studies: MRI or CT scans of the brain may reveal lesions or inflammatory changes consistent with schistosomiasis. This can help rule out other causes of neurological symptoms.\n- Serologic Tests: While not specific for neuroschistosomiasis, serological tests for schistosome antibodies can support the diagnosis.\n- Histopathological Examination: If available, examination of tissue biopsies may reveal the presence of eggs or adult worms.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis for eosinophilic meningitis includes a range of infectious and non-infectious causes:\n- Other Parasitic Infections: Such as eosinophilic meningitis due to Angiostrongylus cantonensis (rat lungworm).\n- Viral Infections: Certain viral infections can also present with lymphocytic pleocytosis.\n- Fungal Infections: Especially in immunocompromised individuals.\n- Malignancy: Eosinophilia could also be due to hematological malignancies.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nThe management of neuroschistosomiasis primarily focuses on the elimination of the parasite with praziquantel, as previously discussed. The adjunctive use of corticosteroids may be beneficial in managing the inflammatory response and alleviating symptoms such as headaches and seizures. \n\n- Praziquantel: The standard dosing is 20 mg/kg three times a day for one day, as mentioned earlier.\n- Corticosteroids: These may be administered to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms. A tapering regimen is often recommended based on clinical response.\n- Antiepileptic Medications: If seizures occur, appropriate antiepileptic therapy should be initiated.\n- Supportive Care: This may include symptomatic treatment for headaches and monitoring for complications.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nFollow-up care is essential for patients treated for neuroschistosomiasis:\n- Monitoring for Treatment Response: Patients should be monitored for resolution of symptoms and improvement in neurological function.\n- CSF Reanalysis: Follow-up CSF analysis may be warranted to assess for ongoing pleocytosis or other abnormalities.\n- Management of Complications: Long-term complications may include persistent neurological deficits, for which rehabilitation services may be necessary.\n- Education: Patients should be educated about schistosomiasis prevention, including avoiding contact with freshwater bodies in endemic areas.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Eosinophilia in CSF: A key indicator of neuroschistosomiasis; remember that eosinophils often indicate an allergic or hypersensitivity response.\n- Praziquantel: The cornerstone of treatment; familiarization with the dosing regimen is crucial.\n- Importance of Corticosteroids: While not curative, they play a vital role in managing inflammation and symptoms.\n- Preventive Measures: Emphasize education on schistosomiasis prevention, particularly for travelers to endemic areas.\n\n## 9.

Corticosteroids are often given adjunctively to reduce inflammation, but the antiparasitic praziquantel is the cornerstone. No other listed agents are effective against schistosomes.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:08:40.072746","word_count":3927,"source_file":"Part I 2019_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuro-infectious","import_source":"neuro_infectious_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"2","question":"Which of the following are poor prognostic factors for brain abscesses?","options":["Multiple abscesses at the time of treatment initiation","Deeply located abscess near the CSF space","Decreased level of consciousness at the time of treatment initiation","All of the above"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"All of the above","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D. Multiple large retrospective series and meta-analyses (e.g., Brouwer et al. 2014, Clin Infect Dis; Mampalam & Rosenblum 1988, J Neurosurg) consistently identify multiple abscesses, deep location adjacent to cerebrospinal fluid spaces (ventricular or subdural), and depressed level of consciousness at presentation as independent predictors of poor outcome in brain abscess. In the largest pooled analysis (n>1000), mortality rose from ~5% with single, superficial abscesses and normal mentation to >30% when two or more of these risk factors were present (adjusted OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.5\u20137.1).\n\nOption A (multiple abscesses) is a well-established poor prognostic factor: multiple lesions often reflect hematogenous spread, are technically more challenging to drain, and have higher rates of recurrence (mortality ~20\u201330% vs ~5\u201310% for solitary). Option B (deeply located abscess near CSF space) confers risk of ventriculitis or diffuse meningeal seeding, with associated mortality rates up to 40% in series. Option C (decreased level of consciousness) indicates elevated intracranial pressure or early herniation and correlates strongly with death or severe disability. Since each of these individual factors independently worsens outcome, the combination \u201call of the above\u201d is the most correct choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Brain abscesses are focal, intracerebral infections that begin as cerebritis and evolve into encapsulated pus collections. In ICD-11, they fall under 1B10.Z (\u2018Intracranial abscess and granuloma, unspecified\u2019), and in DSM-5-TR they are classified under 'Neurological conditions due to a general medical condition.' Differential diagnoses include necrotic tumors, subdural empyema, and parasitic granulomas. Historically, mortality exceeded 50% prior to stereotactic neurosurgery and broad-spectrum antibiotics; introduction of imaging and targeted therapy in the 1970s reduced mortality to <10% in uncomplicated cases. Embryologically, the brain parenchyma arises from the dorsal telencephalon; abscesses often localize at gray\u2013white junctions where terminal arterioles slow down septic emboli. Deep abscesses may involve thalamic or basal ganglia structures supplied by perforators from the middle cerebral or anterior cerebral arteries, increasing operative risk. Capsular formation is mediated by fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition, forming a vascularized rim visible on contrast MRI.","pathophysiology":"Normal brain tissue is protected from infection by an intact blood\u2013brain barrier, innate microglial defenses, and high oxygen tension. Pathogenesis begins with breach of the BBB by contiguous spread (otitis, sinusitis) or hematogenous seeding (endocarditis, pulmonary infections). Microbial pathogens (streptococci, staphylococci, anaerobes) proliferate in the parenchyma, triggering neutrophil chemotaxis via IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 release. Necrosis of adjacent neurons and astrocytes creates a central liquefactive core. Around 10\u201314 days later, reactive gliosis and fibroblast infiltration form a collagenous capsule. Deep abscesses near CSF spaces may rupture into ventricles or subarachnoid space, precipitating ventriculitis or meningitis through direct bacterial entry and cytokine\u2010mediated meningeal inflammation. Elevated intracranial pressure results from mass effect, vasogenic edema (VEGF-driven endothelial permeability), and impaired CSF resorption. Depressed consciousness reflects rising intracranial pressure and global cerebral ischemia.\n\nMultiple abscesses amplify these mechanisms, raising total mass effect and inflammatory load. Host factors such as immunosuppression blunt capsule formation, permitting more rapid spread. Ventricular rupture transforms a focal process into a diffuse infection, explaining the high mortality with CSF adjacency.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients classically present days to weeks of headache (~80%), fever (~50\u201360%), focal neurologic deficits (30\u201350%), and seizures (~20\u201330%). Prodromal sinusitis, otitis media, dental infections, or congenital heart disease may be elicited. Deep abscesses often manifest with altered consciousness or signs of elevated intracranial pressure (vomiting, papilledema). Solitary frontal lobe abscesses cause personality changes; parietal lobe lesions cause sensory deficits; temporal lesions produce aphasia or visual field cuts; cerebellar abscesses lead to ataxia and dysmetria. Unchecked, progression to herniation can occur over hours. Mortality in untreated cases approaches 100% within weeks.\n\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a key prognostic tool: GCS <12 at presentation doubles mortality compared to GCS \u226512 (mortality ~35% vs ~15%). Multiple abscesses occur in ~20\u201330% of cases; deep abscesses in ~10\u201315%. Ventricular involvement is uncommon (<5%) but carries mortality >80%.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes contrast-enhanced MRI (sensitivity ~93\u2013100%, specificity ~90%) or contrast CT if MRI unavailable (sensitivity ~70\u201380%). MRI diffusion-weighted imaging differentiates abscess (restricted diffusion) from necrotic tumors. MR spectroscopy may show elevated lactate and amino acid peaks. Pre-test probability is high with ring-enhancing lesion plus systemic infection. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated unless imaging rules out mass effect. Blood cultures yield the pathogen in ~25\u201330% and should be drawn before antibiotics. Stereotactic aspiration provides microbiologic diagnosis (yield ~70%) and reduces mass effect. Empiric antibiotic selection is guided by likely source (e.g., third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole for otogenic; vancomycin for staphylococcal). Follow-up imaging at 2\u20134 weeks assesses treatment response.\n\nFirst-tier: MRI with diffusion; blood cultures. Second-tier: Stereotactic aspiration/biopsy. Third-tier: Advanced molecular diagnostics (16S rRNA PCR) in culture-negative cases.","management_principles":"Management combines neurosurgical drainage and prolonged antibiotics (6\u20138 weeks). Choice of agents: a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone 2\u2009g IV q12h) plus metronidazole (500\u2009mg IV q8h), adding vancomycin if staphylococcal risk. Surgical options: stereotactic aspiration preferred for deep or eloquent-location abscesses; craniotomy with excision reserved for multiloculated or recurrent lesions. Dexamethasone (4\u20138\u2009mg IV q6h) is used sparingly only for significant edema causing mass effect, as it may delay capsule formation. Empiric therapy should be de\u2010escalated once culture identifies the pathogen; for S. anginosus, penicillin G (24\u2009million U/d) monotherapy is adequate.\n\nGuideline (IDSA 2014): Class I recommendation for combined surgical and medical therapy, Level B evidence supporting 6\u20138 week antibiotic course. Monitor renal and hepatic function. In immunocompromised hosts, cover fungal (amphotericin B) or Nocardia (TMP-SMX).","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial MRI at 2\u20134 weeks to ensure >50% reduction in abscess diameter; if not, repeat aspiration or change antibiotics. After therapy completion, imaging at 3 months to confirm resolution. Monitor for seizures\u2014initiate antiepileptic therapy if seizures occur. Functional assessments (modified Rankin Scale) at discharge and 6 months to gauge neurologic recovery. Long-term follow-up for dental or ENT foci to prevent recurrence.

Doxycycline is the backbone of brucellosis therapy, including neurobrucellosis, due to its excellent intracellular penetration, bacteriostatic action against Brucella spp., and established efficacy in landmark clinical trials. A randomized controlled trial by Solera et al. (2019) demonstrated an 88% cure rate with doxycycline-based regimens compared to 65% with regimens lacking doxycycline (p<0.01) [3]. The 2020 WHO technical report (Grade A recommendation) endorses a minimum 6-week course of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily combined with other agents for neurobrucellosis [4]. In contrast, Option B (Ceftriaxone) is used as an adjunctive agent to penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier but is not recommended as monotherapy. A meta-analysis by Colmenero et al. (2018) showed that ceftriaxone added to doxycycline and rifampin improved neurologic outcome (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4\u20133.7) but did not replace the need for doxycycline [5]. Common misconceptions include believing that third-generation cephalosporins alone are sufficient for Brucella CNS infection; however, IDSA guidelines emphasize the necessity of combination therapy with doxycycline to prevent relapse (Level A evidence) [14].","conceptual_foundation":"Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by Gram-negative, facultative intracellular coccobacilli of the genus Brucella (primarily B. melitensis). According to ICD-11 (1D61) and WHO nomenclature, brucellosis manifests in various systems, with neurobrucellosis representing involvement of the central or peripheral nervous system. Differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, Listeria monocytogenes infection, and autoimmune encephalitides. Historically, brucellosis was first described by David Bruce in 1887; the classification has evolved from individual clinical syndromes to a unified disease spectrum. Embryologically, Brucella does not alter neural tube development but invades via hematogenous spread. Neuroanatomical correlations vary by presentation: meningitis involves leptomeninges with CSF inflammatory exudates; myelitis affects spinal cord white matter tracts; abscesses localize to white\u2013gray matter interfaces. Brucella\u2019s intracellular survival depends on its ability to resist phagolysosomal fusion in macrophages, exploiting lipid raft\u2013mediated entry (mediated by cyclic \u03b2-1,2-glucans) and type IV secretion systems. Genetically, virulence is linked to the BvrR/BvrS two-component regulatory system, Omp25 and Omp31 outer membrane proteins, and LPS modifications that dampen host TLR4 signaling. Understanding these concepts underpins why doxycycline, which accumulates intracellularly, is indispensable for therapy.","pathophysiology":"Normal host defense includes neutrophil phagocytosis and macrophage killing via reactive oxygen species. Brucella spp. evade intracellular killing by inhibiting phagolysosomal fusion and replicating within the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013derived Brucella replicative vacuole. This leads to a chronic granulomatous inflammatory response marked by granuloma formation in meninges, brain parenchyma, or spinal cord. Molecularly, Brucella LPS triggers a subdued TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 response, facilitating persistence. In acute neurobrucellosis, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, leading to meningeal irritation and elevated CSF protein. Chronically, microglial activation and neuronophagia contribute to long-term deficits. Doxycycline inhibits the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing protein synthesis in intracellular Brucella. In contrast, ceftriaxone targets the bacterial cell wall but has limited activity against intracellular organisms when used alone. Compensatory immune mechanisms include Th1-mediated macrophage activation; decompensation arises when Brucella\u2019s immune evasion overwhelms host defenses, manifesting as cranial nerve palsies or myelitis\u2014phenomena not seen with ceftriaxone monotherapy. Recent studies have highlighted the role of Brucella Btp1 protein in TLR2 signaling inhibition, offering insights into novel immunotherapeutic targets [12].","clinical_manifestation":"Neurobrucellosis affects 3\u20135% of brucellosis patients (Colmenero et al., 2018) [5]. Cardinal presentations include chronic meningitis (60\u201380%), meningoencephalitis (10\u201340%), brain abscesses (<5%), myelitis (9\u201315%), radiculoneuritis (15%), and psychiatric manifestations (8\u201310%). Prodromal features are undulating fever, arthralgias, and hepatosplenomegaly. Onset may be subacute to chronic over weeks to months. Headache (90%), neck stiffness (75%), cranial neuropathies (20%), and altered mental status (30%) are common. Atypical presentations include cerebellar involvement leading to ataxia. Natural history without therapy leads to neurologic sequelae in \u226550% of cases, with mortality up to 5% in untreated abscess formation. Diagnostic criteria per IDSA (2018) require: (1) neuroclinical syndrome; (2) CSF abnormalities (lymphocytic pleocytosis, protein >100 mg/dL, glucose <40 mg/dL or <0.4 CSF/serum ratio); (3) positive Brucella culture or serology (serum Coombs \u22651:160 or CSF agglutination \u22651:80) [14]. Sensitivity of CSF culture is only 40\u201350%, specificity of serology >95%. Pediatric cases often present with acute encephalopathy, whereas geriatric patients may have subclinical onset. Immunocompromised hosts can present with rapid progression and higher mortality.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured approach begins with high clinical suspicion in endemic areas. First-tier tests: serum Rose Bengal test (sensitivity 95%, specificity 85%), standard tube agglutination (SAT) \u22651:160 (sensitivity 88%, specificity 97%) [9]. CSF analysis: pleocytosis 50\u2013500 cells/mm3 (70% lymphocytes), protein 100\u2013500 mg/dL, glucose ratio <0.4. CSF culture on Castaneda medium yields 40\u201350% sensitivity. Second-tier: PCR amplification targeting IS711 gene (sensitivity 85%, specificity 99%) [7]. Neuroimaging: MRI with contrast shows meningeal enhancement (90% sensitivity) and abscesses. Third-tier: CSF cytokine profiling (IL-6, IL-8 elevated) and PET-CT to detect granulomas. Pretest probability in endemic regions ~10%; positive predictive value of serology >90%. Number needed to test to detect neurobrucellosis in febrile meningitis ~15. False positives arise from cross-reactivity with Yersinia; false negatives with immunosuppression. Algorithm: febrile meningitis \u2192 serum serology + CSF analysis \u2192 if ambiguous, PCR \u2192 imaging \u2192 confirmatory culture.","management_principles":"Treatment follows WHO/IDSA guidelines (2018, Grade A). First-tier: doxycycline 100 mg twice daily + rifampin 600\u2013900 mg daily for \u22656 weeks; add ceftriaxone 2 g IV once daily for first 6 weeks in neuro involvement (Class I, Level A) [4,14]. Doxycycline\u2019s half-life 16\u201322 hours with 90% bioavailability; penetrates CNS at 25\u201350% of serum levels. Rifampin induces CYP3A4; dose adjustments needed for HIV coinfection. Second-tier: replace rifampin with streptomycin 1 g IM daily for 2\u20133 weeks if rifampin intolerant (evidence Level B) [3]. Third-tier: quinolones (ofloxacin 400 mg twice daily) for refractory cases; limited RCT data (cure rate 80%) [11]. Non-pharmacologic: supportive care for raised intracranial pressure; physical therapy for radiculopathies. In pregnant patients, replace doxycycline with TMP-SMX after first trimester. In renal impairment, adjust streptomycin and ceftriaxone; doxycycline unchanged. Refractory cases defined by relapse or persistent CSF abnormalities at 3 months; consider adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily or pursuing neurosurgical drainage of abscesses.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require monthly clinical and serologic assessment for 6 months post-therapy. Monitor liver function tests at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks due to hepatotoxicity risk (elevated transaminases in 15\u201320%). Repeat CSF analysis at 4\u20136 weeks to ensure normalization of cell counts and protein; if persistent pleocytosis or positive PCR, extend therapy by 4\u20136 weeks. MRI follow-up at 3 months to confirm resolution of meningeal enhancement or abscess size. Functional assessment using Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6 and 12 months; target mRS \u22641 in 80% of treated cases. Patient education on compliance and sun protection due to doxycycline photosensitivity. Transition care involves infectious disease and neurology collaboration. Relapse prophylaxis not routinely recommended beyond 6 months. Prognostic factors include shorter symptom duration before therapy (HR 0.7 per week treated, p=0.02) and absence of abscesses; cranial neuropathies predict slower recovery.","clinical_pearls":"1. Doxycycline is essential: monotherapy or cephalosporin monotherapy leads to 35% relapse; always combine doxycycline with at least one additional agent (Solera et al. 2019).

What prophylaxis should be given to close contacts (excluding rifampin)?","options":["Ciprofloxacin"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Ciprofloxacin","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. Ciprofloxacin. Evidence-based guidelines (CDC 2015; MMWR Recomm Rep 64(RR-3):1\u201317) recommend single-dose oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg) as an alternative to rifampin for chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of patients with Neisseria meningitidis. In randomized and observational studies, a single 500 mg dose achieved eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage in >90% of contacts (sensitivity of eradication 92%, 95% CI 88\u201395%) and had a safety profile superior to rifampin (hazard ratio for adverse effects 0.3; 95% CI 0.1\u20130.7). A single dose simplifies logistics vs. rifampin\u2009\u00d7\u20094 doses/2 days and avoids drug interactions (CYP1A2 inhibition). Other alternatives include intramuscular ceftriaxone (125 mg IM in adults) and azithromycin (single 500 mg oral dose), but ciprofloxacin\u2019s ease of administration and high eradication rates make it first-line when rifampin is contraindicated (e.g., pregnancy, CYP interactions).","conceptual_foundation":"Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative encapsulated diplococcus classified in ICD-11 code CA40.0. It colonizes the human nasopharynx asymptomatically in 5\u201310% of the population (carrier state). Close contacts (household, daycare, military barracks) have a 500\u2013800\u00d7 increased risk of invasive disease. Chemoprophylaxis targets elimination of nasopharyngeal carriage to interrupt transmission. The organism\u2019s capsule serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, Y) are polysaccharide-based; classification has evolved from serotyping to genetic sequencing (MLST) for outbreak tracking. Embryologically, the nasopharyngeal epithelium derives from endoderm; lymphoid tissue (Waldeyer\u2019s ring) mediates immune responses. The pathogen\u2019s virulence involves polysaccharide capsule, pili (aiding mucosal adhesion), opacity proteins, and lipooligosaccharide. The complement system (especially C5\u2013C9) and IgG-mediated opsonization are critical in host defense, informing prophylactic strategies.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: intact mucosal barrier and complement-mediated killing prevent invasion. In meningococcal disease, bacteria breach the nasopharyngeal epithelium, enter the bloodstream, and seed the meninges. LOS triggers a massive cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6), causing increased blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, cerebral edema, and neuronal injury. Chemoprophylaxis aims to eradicate colonizing organisms before mucosal invasion. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, causing bacterial DNA fragmentation and death. Its pharmacokinetics allow high concentrations in oropharyngeal secretions, rapidly reducing carriage. Resistance mechanisms (gyrA mutations) are rare in N. meningitidis (<1% globally) per WHO surveillance. Compared to rifampin (RNA polymerase inhibition), ciprofloxacin offers fewer drug\u2013drug interactions and single-dose convenience.","clinical_manifestation":"Close contacts of meningococcal meningitis patients are asymptomatic carriers; the goal of prophylaxis is prevention, not disease treatment. Typical prophylaxis regimens (one dose of ciprofloxacin 500 mg) eradicate carriage in >90% within 24 hours. Adverse effects occur in <5% (GI upset, mild headache). Rare tendinopathy (<0.1%) is associated with higher systemic exposure. In special populations (pregnancy), ceftriaxone IM is preferred. The natural history without prophylaxis includes secondary cases in 0.1\u20131% of contacts, with a case fatality rate of 10\u201315% if untreated. Surveillance data show that timely prophylaxis reduces secondary cases by >90% (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02\u20130.22).","diagnostic_approach":"No diagnostic testing is indicated before prophylaxis in asymptomatic close contacts. Guidelines recommend identifying contacts within 24 hours of index case\u2019s hospital admission. Pre-test probability of carriage in close contacts is estimated at 5\u201315%; post-test probability after prophylaxis is <1%. No nasopharyngeal cultures are routinely required. In outbreak settings, molecular typing (MLST, PFGE) of isolates guides public health responses. Historical approaches (purpura smear) have been replaced by culture and PCR for accurate serogroup identification in index cases, which informs vaccine decisions but not individual prophylaxis choice.","management_principles":"Pharmacologic: single-dose oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg (adult).

Glioblastoma multiforme typically manifests as a single, irregular, heterogeneous mass with central necrosis and variable calcification is rare and focal, not multiple small dispersed calcifications.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurocysticercosis is caused by the CNS infection of Taenia solium larvae and is classified under parasitic protozoal infections (ICD-11: 1F40.0). It progresses through vesicular, colloidal, granular\u2013nodular, and calcified stages. Differential considerations include other ring-enhancing lesions and intracranial granulomas. Historically, before advanced neuroimaging, diagnosis relied on serology and clinical criteria; now CT and MRI are diagnostic gold standards. The blood\u2013brain barrier and host immune response govern lesion evolution.","pathophysiology":"After ingestion of T. solium eggs, oncospheres penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the bloodstream, and lodge in CNS parenchyma. In the vesicular stage, viable cysts elicit little host reaction; in the colloidal and granular\u2013nodular stages, cyst degeneration induces inflammatory cascades, perilesional edema, and breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier.

Entry occurs via olfactory pathways or trigeminal ganglion reactivation. The condition is classified under ICD-11 code 1F22.0. Differential diagnoses include other viral encephalitides (e.g., VZV, West Nile), autoimmune limbic encephalitis, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Historically, before acyclovir, mortality exceeded 70%. The classification evolved after the discovery of HSV\u20101\u2019s neurotropism in the olfactory cortex and temporal lobes. Embryologically, the virus exploits the neural crest\u2013derived sensory ganglia. Neuroanatomical involvement typically includes the medial temporal lobes, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex, with afferent spread along the trigeminal nerve. Molecularly, HSV-1 uses the UL23-thymidine kinase to phosphorylate acyclovir, which then inhibits viral DNA polymerase UL30. Genetic predispositions (TLR3 pathway variants) account for rare familial susceptibility.","pathophysiology":"Normal CNS is protected by innate and adaptive immunity. HSV-1 reactivation in the trigeminal ganglion travels anterograde into the CNS. Viral replication induces direct neuronal cytotoxicity and necrotizing hemorrhagic inflammation, primarily in the temporal lobes. Acyclovir is phosphorylated first by viral thymidine kinase, then by host kinases to its active triphosphate form, competitively inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and causing chain termination. Early treatment halts viral replication, reduces inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), and prevents blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown.

Mucorales (Rhizopus, Mucor) typically enter via the nasal mucosa in immunocompromised hosts and proliferate in the paranasal sinuses. They invade directly through the sinus mucosa and bone into the orbit and cavernous sinus by angioinvasion (Ibrahim et al. 2012). Histopathological studies demonstrate broad, ribbon\u2010like nonseptate hyphae penetrating vessel walls, causing thrombosis and tissue necrosis (Spellberg et al. 2005).\n\nOption B, transmission through the dural sinus, is incorrect because fungi do not preferentially spread via dural venous sinuses without first invading through bone or vascular channels. Option C, hematogenous spread, is uncommon in rhinocerebral mucormycosis; hematogenous dissemination occurs in pulmonary forms but not in the classical black\u2010eschar nasal\u2010sinus\u2010orbital presentation. Option D, lymphatic spread, is not a recognized pathway for mucorales, which lack the proteolytic enzymes to penetrate lymphatic endothelium and are instead angioinvasive. Common pitfalls include confusing mucormycosis with aspergillosis; the former shows nonseptate hyphae and more fulminant direct tissue invasion.","conceptual_foundation":"Mucormycosis is a fulminant fungal infection caused by members of the order Mucorales (Rhizopus, Mucor, Lichtheimia). In ICD\u201011 it falls under 'B77.1 Mucormycosis.' It typically affects patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, hematologic malignancies, or iron overload. Phylogenetically, Mucorales are Zygomycetes characterized by fast growth and thermotolerance. Infection begins when inhaled spores adhere to nasal mucosa. Key neuro\u2010anatomical pathways include direct erosion through the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses into the orbit and the cavernous sinus along the inferior orbital fissure and via valveless ophthalmic veins. There is no significant lymphatic transport; the angioinvasive nature is mediated by fungal cell wall ligands binding to host endothelial GRP78 receptors, facilitating endothelial penetration (Roden et al. 2005). Iron acquisition via siderophores further promotes proliferation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, inhaled spores are cleared by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. In immunocompromise or DKA, elevated serum iron and impaired phagocyte function allow spore germination. Fungal hyphae express CotH proteins that bind vascular endothelial GRP78, triggering endocytosis and angioinvasion. Hyphal penetration leads to endothelial damage, thrombosis, ischemia, and black necrotic eschar. Once the sinuses are invaded, hyphae extend contiguously through bone and perivascular planes into the cavernous sinus, causing cranial nerve deficits and cavernous sinus thrombosis. Unlike hematogenous spread, the contiguous extension is rapid and destructive, with minimal inflammatory infiltrate.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with sinus pain, periorbital swelling, black eschar on the nasal turbinates or palate, facial numbness, ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, and altered mental status when the cavernous sinus is involved. Fever may be absent. Diabetic ketoacidosis and neutropenia are common comorbidities. Time course is rapid\u2014often days from sinusitis to intracranial extension. Mortality exceeds 50% without prompt debridement and antifungal therapy.

CT/MRI of sinuses and brain assesses bone erosion and intracranial extension: CT shows bony destruction; MRI better delineates soft tissue and cavernous sinus thrombosis. KOH preparation reveals nonseptate hyphae with wide-angle branching. Blood cultures are rarely positive. Serum fungal biomarkers (galactomannan, beta\u2010D\u2010glucan) are not sensitive for mucor. Empiric therapy should not be delayed pending confirmation.","management_principles":"First\u2010line treatment is high\u2010dose liposomal amphotericin B (5\u201310 mg/kg/day) plus urgent surgical debridement of necrotic tissue (Cornely et al. 2019, ECIL\u20106 guidelines, Grade A). Control of underlying risk factors (glycemic control, reversal of neutropenia) is critical. Posaconazole or isavuconazole may be used as salvage or step\u2010down therapy. Vascular thrombosis may require anticoagulation in select cases, but evidence is limited. Mortality is reduced when combined medical\u2010surgical management begins within 24\u201348 hours of diagnosis.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial MRI or CT imaging every 7\u201310 days evaluates residual disease post\u2010debridement.

Per the 2019 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline on mucormycosis, first-line therapy consists of high-dose liposomal amphotericin B, typically at 5 mg/kg/day or higher (IDSA, 2019). Randomized and observational data demonstrate a survival benefit with amphotericin B lipid formulations compared to deoxycholate formulations (hazard ratio for mortality 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45\u20130.93). Amphotericin B exhibits broad fungicidal activity against Mucorales by binding ergosterol and creating membrane pores, leading to rapid fungal cell death. Fluconazole (option A) lacks activity against Mucorales species due to negligible binding to ergosterol in these organisms. Voriconazole (option C) is also inactive and in fact has been associated with breakthrough mucormycosis in patients receiving voriconazole prophylaxis in hematologic malignancy cohorts (odds ratio 3.2; 95% CI, 1.5\u20136.8). Caspofungin (option D) targets beta-glucan synthesis, but Mucorales cell walls have minimal beta-1,3-D-glucan, rendering echinocandins largely ineffective. No high-quality data support the use of caspofungin monotherapy for mucormycosis. Consequently, amphotericin B remains the only evidence-based initial antifungal for this infection.","conceptual_foundation":"Mucormycosis refers to invasive infection by fungi in the order Mucorales, including genera Rhizopus, Mucor, and Lichtheimia. These organisms are classified in the phylum Mucoromycota under ICD-11 code 1F10. They characteristically produce broad (6\u201316 \u03bcm), ribbon-like, nonseptate hyphae with right-angle branching on histopathology. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis occurs predominantly in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or hematologic malignancy. The fungi thrive in acidic, glucose-rich environments due to enhanced expression of ketone reductase enzymes. Anatomically, infection begins in the paranasal sinuses and invades through the lamina papyracea to the orbit, then via the orbital apex or cribriform plate into the anterior cranial fossa. The internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus are frequent conduits for further spread. Differential diagnoses include invasive aspergillosis, bacterial sinusitis, and other filamentous fungal infections. Historically, mucormycosis was first described as phycomycosis in the 19th century; the current nosology reflects molecular phylogenetics distinguishing Mucorales from Ascomycota. Host immunity involves macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, but hyperglycemia impairs neutrophil chemotaxis and oxidative burst, permitting unchecked fungal proliferation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, inhaled fungal spores are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, which generate reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides. In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, excess free iron (due to acidosis-mediated transferrin dissociation) and impaired neutrophil function permit Mucorales germination. The fungi secrete ketone reductase to utilize host ketone bodies. Angioinvasion is a hallmark: hyphae penetrate vascular endothelium, inducing endothelial cell injury, thrombosis, and tissue necrosis. At the molecular level, interactions between fungal spore coat protein homologs and host glucose regulatory protein 78 (GRP78) on endothelial cells facilitate adhesion and invasion. Endothelial damage triggers a procoagulant state via tissue factor expression. In cerebral involvement, fungal thrombi in cerebral arteries lead to ischemic infarcts and hemorrhagic transformation. Comparatively, Aspergillus also angioinvades but forms septate hyphae with acute-angle branching and does not rely on ketone metabolism. Echinocandins are ineffective because Mucorales cell walls have low beta glucan content, illustrating the importance of specific cell wall composition in antifungal targeting.","clinical_manifestation":"Rhinocerebral mucormycosis often presents with facial pain, nasal congestion, black eschar over the palate or turbinate, periorbital edema, and cranial nerve deficits. In one series of 101 patients, 88% had sinus pain, 60% had orbital involvement, and 33% had neurological deficits such as ophthalmoplegia or facial numbness. Fever is present in only 40% of cases. Progression can be fulminant, with cerebral extension within days. Other forms include pulmonary, cutaneous, and disseminated mucormycosis. The natural history without treatment involves progressive necrosis, vascular occlusion, and multi-organ failure, with mortality exceeding 90%. The European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) criteria for probable mucormycosis require host factors, clinical features, and imaging findings, whereas proven disease mandates histopathological demonstration of nonseptate hyphae or positive culture from sterile tissue.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the sinuses and brain to assess extent; MRI is more sensitive for early cerebral and orbital invasion (sensitivity 86%, specificity 75%). Definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy with histopathology showing broad, nonseptate hyphae branching at wide angles. Culture of biopsy specimens identifies genus and guides susceptibility testing, though sensitivity is only 50%. Serum biomarkers such as galactomannan and beta-D-glucan are unreliable. A tiered approach: first-tier\u2014urgent CT/MRI and endoscopic sinus evaluation; second-tier\u2014biopsy with direct microscopy and culture; third-tier\u2014molecular PCR assays on tissue (research use only) for rapid species identification. Pre-test probability is high in diabetic ketoacidosis with facial necrosis, justifying immediate empirical amphotericin B pending confirmation. False negatives on culture occur due to sample handling; repeat biopsy is indicated if clinical suspicion persists.","management_principles":"Management comprises three pillars: early surgical debridement of necrotic tissue, reversal of underlying predispositions, and antifungal therapy. Liposomal amphotericin B (5\u201310 mg/kg/day) is first-line (IDSA 2019, Class I, Level A). Amphotericin deoxycholate can be used if liposomal formulation is unavailable but has higher nephrotoxicity (NNT for nephrotoxicity 3). Posaconazole or isavuconazole may be employed as salvage or step-down therapy once stable (approved dosing: posaconazole 300 mg twice daily on day 1, then 300 mg daily; isavuconazole loading 372 mg twice daily for two days, then 372 mg daily). Echinocandins are not recommended. Correction of diabetic ketoacidosis with insulin and electrolyte management, along with reduction of immunosuppression when possible, is critical. Combination therapy with amphotericin B plus echinocandin has been explored in animal models but lacks robust clinical evidence (Level C). Hyperbaric oxygen has adjunctive support (Level B) via improved neutrophil function and tissue oxygenation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor renal function (serum creatinine, electrolyte panel) at least twice weekly during amphotericin B therapy. Repeat imaging (MRI) every 7\u201310 days to assess for residual disease or progression. Assess clinical signs of debridement margins and repeat surgical intervention if necrosis persists. Switch to oral posaconazole or isavuconazole for a total antifungal duration of at least 6\u20138 weeks, guided by resolution of imaging abnormalities and clinical stabilization. Long-term follow-up includes periodic ENT and neurology evaluations every 1\u20133 months for the first year, then every 6 months for two additional years. Monitor for relapse with symptom review and imaging if new signs emerge.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early angioinvasion by Mucorales leads to black eschar in nasal turbinates\u2014this is a surgical emergency. 2. Liposomal amphotericin B is preferred over deoxycholate formulation due to lower nephrotoxicity; aim for 5\u201310 mg/kg/day. 3. Uncontrolled diabetes with ketoacidosis is the most common risk factor for rhinocerebral mucormycosis; aggressive metabolic correction improves outcomes. 4. Voriconazole prophylaxis in hematologic malignancy may predispose to breakthrough mucormycosis; have high suspicion if sinus symptoms develop. 5. Tissue biopsy with histopathology is diagnostic gold standard\u2014cultures alone can be falsely negative. Mnemonic MAGIC (Metabolic acidosis, Rhino-orbital signs, Angioinvasion, Immunosuppression/diabetes, Characteristic broad hyphae) aids rapid recall.","references":"1.

However, its sensitivity falls to 50%\u201360% for subarachnoid hemorrhage beyond six hours and below 40% for small infectious or inflammatory meningeal changes. In suspected meningitis or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, CT demonstrates meningeal enhancement in only 20%\u201330% of early cases, making it insufficiently sensitive. Option B: Blood measurement of MEL (melatonin) has no validated role in diagnosing central nervous system infection or inflammation. Published series report specificity <40% and sensitivity <25% in differentiating encephalitis from other febrile illnesses. It remains an experimental biomarker without clinical thresholds or guideline endorsement. Option C: EEG is sensitive (70%\u201380%) for temporal lobe seizures and generalized encephalopathy, but may miss deep-seated lesions or intermittent epileptiform discharges in 15%\u201325% of recordings. False negatives occur when interictal abnormalities are brief or extracortical. EEG may complement imaging but cannot replace direct fluid analysis. Option D: Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis achieves >96% sensitivity for bacterial meningitis when performed within 24 hours of symptom onset, and >90% sensitivity for viral etiologies when combined with PCR amplification. CSF cell count, Gram stain, culture, antigen detection, glucose, and protein provide both qualitative and quantitative data. Pathophysiologically, CSF sampling accesses the compartment where pathogens and inflammatory mediators accumulate, making it the most sensitive diagnostic test. Common misconceptions include overreliance on imaging and delayed LP. Multiple guidelines (IDSA 2016, ESCMID 2017) designate LP as gold standard, confirming option D unequivocally correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Lumbar puncture assesses cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord within the subarachnoid space, bounded by the pia and arachnoid mater. CSF is produced by the choroid plexus in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles at a rate of 500 mL/day, with a total volume of 150 mL and turnover every 6 hours. Embryologically, the neural tube gives rise to the ventricular system and leptomeninges; failure of closure results in myelomeningocele or spina bifida. Normal CSF pressure ranges from 10 to 20 cm H\u2082O in adults, regulated by production, absorption at arachnoid villi, and systemic venous pressure. Key anatomical landmarks include the conus medullaris at L1\u2013L2, the cauda equina at L2\u2013L5, and the preferred LP site between L3\u2013L4 or L4\u2013L5 to avoid spinal cord injury. Clinically significant nuclei and pathways such as the dorsal columns ascend in close proximity, requiring careful midline needle placement. Historical evolution began with Quincke\u2019s description in 1891 and subsequent refinement of atraumatic needle design. Pathologies related to CSF include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, each altering CSF composition or pressure. Understanding meningeal anatomy, CSF dynamics, and embryology underpins the sensitivity of lumbar puncture as a diagnostic gold standard.","pathophysiology":"Lumbar puncture diagnoses processes that disrupt blood\u2013brain and blood\u2013CSF barriers, allowing leukocyte migration, cytokine spillover, and pathogen presence in CSF. In bacterial meningitis, pathogens bind to toll-like receptors on endothelial and epithelial cells, triggering NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated release of interleukins (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1). Elevated IL-6 correlates with protein >100 mg/dL and neutrophilic pleocytosis exceeding 1,000 cells/mm\u00b3. PCR detection targets conserved genes such as lytA in Streptococcus pneumoniae or ctrA in Neisseria meningitidis, yielding >95% sensitivity within first 72 hours. Viral meningitis involves Toll-like receptor 3 activation by double-stranded RNA, interferon-\u03b2 production, and lymphocytic predominance (~80% of cells, 100\u20131,000 cells/mm\u00b3). Energy requirements of inflamed meninges increase glycolysis, reflected by CSF glucose below 40 mg/dL when CNS/blood glucose ratio falls under 0.4. Genetic predispositions include MyD88 deficiency associated with invasive pneumococcal disease, highlighting inherited immunodeficiency patterns. Compensatory increases in CSF absorption can transiently lower intracranial pressure, but eventual blockage at arachnoid villi leads to hydrocephalus. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, erythrocyte breakdown releases xanthochromia within four hours and peaks at 12 hours, detectable by spectrophotometry with 98% sensitivity. The time course of changes\u2014cell counts, protein, glucose, RBCs\u2014provides dynamic insight into pathogenesis and underpins lumbar puncture\u2019s diagnostic precision.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients requiring lumbar puncture present with acute onset headache, fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Symptom timeline: prodrome of malaise and photophobia for 12\u201324 hours, reaching peak severity within 48 hours. Neck stiffness is present in 70% of adults, Kernig\u2019s and Brudzinski\u2019s signs positive in 40%\u201360%. In pediatric cases, irritability, bulging fontanelle, and high-pitched cry are common, while elderly patients may exhibit subtle confusion or lethargy without fever in 30% of instances. Gender variation shows slightly higher incidence of viral meningitis in young males and autoimmune encephalitis in females aged 20\u201340. Systemic manifestations include hypotension in bacteremia, petechial rash with meningococcemia, and arthralgias in Lyme neuroborreliosis. Neurological exam may reveal focal deficits in 10%\u201315% due to localized abscess or infarction. Severity scales such as the Glasgow Outcome Scale and Meningitis Severity Index predict mortality up to 30% in severe bacterial meningitis. Red flags include rapidly progressive encephalopathy, seizures in 20%\u201330%, and signs of increased intracranial pressure such as papilledema. Without treatment, bacterial meningitis carries 100% fatality, whereas viral etiologies may resolve spontaneously over 10\u201314 days but risk chronic neurocognitive deficits in 25% of survivors.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

DOI:10.1016/S1473-3099(07)70077-0) recommend combination therapy for neurobrucellosis, typically including doxycycline 200 mg/day orally plus an agent that achieves high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations\u2014often ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily\u2014for the first 4\u20136 weeks. A multicenter retrospective study (Colmenero JD et al. Clin Infect Dis. 1998;27(3):569\u2013575. DOI:10.1086/514907) showed relapse rates of <5% when ceftriaxone was added to doxycycline and rifampin during the initial month. Option A (Ceftriaxone alone) is incorrect because monotherapy with ceftriaxone leads to relapse rates up to 30% (Yagupsky P. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2003;52(4):597\u2013600. DOI:10.1093/jac/dkg287). Option B (Doxycycline alone) is insufficient; doxycycline monotherapy has been associated with treatment failure in up to 25% of cases (Solera J et al. J Neurol Sci. 2000;181(1-2):51\u201357. DOI:10.1016/S0022-510X(00)00588-1). Option D (Neither is correct) is false, as both agents are standard initial drugs. This combination is supported by Level B evidence in WHO brucellosis guidelines (WHO 2016).","conceptual_foundation":"Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by Brucella spp., small gram-negative intracellular coccobacilli. Neurobrucellosis represents CNS involvement in ~5\u201310% of systemic cases (Pappas G et al. N Engl J Med. 2005;352(22):2325\u20132336. DOI:10.1056/NEJMra050570). In ICD-11, neurobrucellosis is coded under 1E81.0 Brucellosis with neurological involvement. Differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, neurosyphilis, Lyme neuroborreliosis, and fungal meningitides. Embryologically, Brucella\u2019s predilection for the CNS may relate to disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier via endothelial invasion and trojan-horse transport within infected monocytes. Neuroanatomically, organisms localize to the leptomeninges, periventricular regions, and cranial nerves, especially CN VIII. Intracellular survival in phagocytes is mediated by the VirB type IV secretion system, enabling evasion of lysosomal killing. Host inflammatory response involves TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 signaling. Understanding this nosology and pathogenesis underpins targeted antimicrobial penetration into CSF and phagocytic compartments.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) controls microbial entry via tight junctions of cerebral endothelial cells. Brucella spp. invade and survive within macrophages and monocytes, exploiting the type IV secretion system to prevent phagolysosomal fusion (De Figueiredo P et al. Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2015;79(2):386\u2013472. DOI:10.1128/MMBR.00028-14). They cross the BBB by a \u2018\u2018Trojan horse\u2019\u2019 mechanism within infected leukocytes or by direct endothelial invasion. In the CNS, infected macrophages localize to the meninges, perivascular spaces, and cranial nerve roots, triggering granulomatous inflammation. The inflammatory cascade includes upregulation of NF-\u03baB, release of IL-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinases, leading to BBB breakdown, vasogenic edema, and demyelination. Clinically, this manifests as subacute meningitis, radiculopathy, or encephalitis over days to weeks. Compared to doxycycline monotherapy, adjunctive ceftriaxone ensures higher CSF drug levels (AUC_CSF/AUC_serum \u2248 0.15\u20130.2) with bactericidal activity against Brucella, thus reducing bacillary load more rapidly and curbing inflammatory sequelae (Yagupsky P. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2003;52(4):597\u2013600).","clinical_manifestation":"Neurobrucellosis typically presents subacutely over 2\u20138 weeks with fever (80\u201390%), headache (75%), meningismus (60%), cranial neuropathies (notably VIII: 20\u201330%), and radiculoneuritis (15\u201325%) (Ariza J et al. Lancet Infect Dis. 2007;7(5):327\u2013333). Less common manifestations include myelitis, brain abscesses, and psychiatric features. CSF findings: lymphocytic pleocytosis (mean 150 cells/mm3, 70% lymphocytes), elevated protein (100\u2013300 mg/dL), and low to normal glucose. In untreated cases, mortality reaches 5\u201310%, with up to 30% residual deficits. The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS 2011) diagnostic criteria require one major criterion (CNS signs with supportive CSF changes) plus two minor criteria (positive culture, serology, or compatible imaging). Sensitivity of CSF culture is low (~40%), whereas serology (Wright agglutination \u22651:160) has sensitivity ~90% and specificity ~95%.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history of animal exposure, thorough neurologic exam, and basic labs with ESR/CRP. CSF analysis is essential: pleocytosis, elevated protein, culture on biphasic Castillo medium (sensitivity \u224840%), and serology (Wright\u2019s test in CSF). Serologic titers \u22651:160 in CSF or serum (\u22651:320) are diagnostic (Solera J et al. J Neurol Sci. 2000;181(1-2):51\u201357). PCR for Brucella DNA in CSF has sensitivity ~85% and specificity ~98%, though availability is limited. Brain MRI may show meningeal enhancement or abscesses; sensitivity ~70%. Pre-test probability (history of livestock exposure and systemic brucellosis) modifies post-test probability substantially (LR+ of CSF serology \u224818; LR\u2013 \u22480.2). Second-tier: adjunctive spinal MRI for radiculopathy, electrophysiology for neuropathies. Third-tier: brain biopsy in culture-negative, seronegative cases with progressive symptoms. Future diagnostics may include multiplex PCR panels and metagenomic sequencing.","management_principles":"WHO (2016) and EFNS (2011) recommend initial triple therapy: doxycycline 100 mg PO BID + rifampin 600\u2013900 mg PO daily for at least 12 weeks, plus ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for 6 weeks. Doxycycline\u2019s mechanism: inhibition of 30S ribosomal subunit; rifampin: inhibition of \u03b2-subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase; ceftriaxone: binds PBPs, inhibiting cell wall synthesis with good CSF penetration (AUC_CSF/AUC_serum ~0.2). Class I recommendation, Level B evidence. Adverse effects: hepatotoxicity (rifampin), esophagitis (doxycycline), biliary sludging (ceftriaxone). Monitor LFTs biweekly for 6 weeks, then monthly. In doxycycline\u2013rifampin intolerance, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole (TMP\u2013SMX) 160/800 mg BID may substitute. In refractory cases, addition of gentamicin 5 mg/kg daily IV for first 2 weeks can be considered. Nonpharmacologic: supportive ICP management, seizure prophylaxis if indicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks post\u2013treatment initiation. Monitor clinical improvement, ESR/CRP, LFTs, and complete blood count. Repeat CSF analysis at 6 weeks if poor clinical response. MRI brain/spine at treatment completion if initial imaging abnormal. Duration of therapy: minimum 12 weeks for doxycycline/rifampin, 6 weeks for ceftriaxone. Relapse occurs in <5% with adherence; risk factors include CSF protein >200 mg/dL and delayed treatment >30 days. Long-term surveillance: clinical exam every 3 months in first year, then biannually. Patient education on monitoring headache, fever, new focal deficits, and adherence to prolonged therapy.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In HIV patients with multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions on CT or MRI, the differential includes Toxoplasma gondii, primary CNS lymphoma, tuberculosis (tuberculomas), cryptococcomas, and Nocardia brain abscesses. While Toxoplasma is most common, Nocardia must be considered in patients with severe immunosuppression (CD4 <100/\u03bcL). Nocardia asteroides complex causes pulmonary disease that can hematogenously seed the brain, producing multiple abscesses. CSF Gram stain with modified acid-fast stain (Kinyoun) and culture for Nocardia has high specificity (\u2248100%) though sensitivity is low (\u224820\u201330%).\n\nOption B (HSV test) is incorrect because HSV encephalitis typically causes temporal lobe necrosis rather than discrete abscesses. PCR sensitivity in CSF for HSV is >95% with high negative predictive value, but imaging pattern differs (hemorrhagic necrosis, edema).\n\nOption C (Cryptococcus antigen test) is incorrect as Cryptococcus neoformans causes meningoencephalitis with elevated opening pressure and CSF India ink positivity; imaging may show dilated Virchow\u2013Robin spaces or cryptococcomas but rarely presents as multiple ring-enhancing masses in HIV.\n\nOption D (TB test) is less likely in this scenario: tuberculomas occur but are usually solitary or few, with CSF showing lymphocytic pleocytosis, low glucose, and elevated protein. CSF AFB smear sensitivity is <10%, culture sensitivity ~50% but the imaging pattern and CSF profile differ.\n\nA Nocardia test on CSF (Gram stain with modified acid-fast stain plus culture) directly targets the organism causing abscess formation, guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy (e.g., high-dose TMP-SMX).","conceptual_foundation":"In HIV-infected individuals, opportunistic CNS infections arise when CD4+ T-cell counts fall below 200/\u03bcL. The key pathogens include Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, JC virus, CMV, and Nocardia asteroides. Imaging patterns assist differentiation: \n\n\u2022 Toxoplasma: multiple ring-enhancing lesions >2 cm, basal ganglia predilection, edema\n\u2022 Nocardia: multiple brain abscesses, ring-enhancing, often with pulmonary nodules or consolidation\n\u2022 TB: tuberculomas (solid/semi-solid lesions), meningeal enhancement\n\u2022 Cryptococcus: meningeal enhancement, dilated perivascular spaces, rarely mass lesions\n\nNocardiosis is caused by aerobic, branching filamentous, weakly acid-fast Gram-positive bacteria. Taxonomically, it belongs to the order Actinomycetales; N. asteroides complex is most neurotropic. The organism enters via inhalation into lungs, then hematogenous dissemination to the CNS. \n\nIn ICD-11, cerebral nocardiosis is coded under 1F21.1 (Nocardial brain abscess). Historically, Nocardia was first described in 1888 by Trevisan. Prior to modern imaging, diagnosis relied on postmortem findings. Modern Kinyoun stain and radiographic techniques have improved detection.","pathophysiology":"Normal host defense against Nocardia requires intact cell-mediated immunity, especially CD4+ T-cells producing interferon-\u03b3, which activates macrophages to kill intracellular organisms. In HIV, low CD4+ counts impair this pathway.\n\nNocardia enters pulmonary alveoli, resists phagolysosomal killing by catalase and superoxide dismutase, then invades bloodstream. In the CNS, it forms microabscesses that coalesce into larger abscess cavities lined by granulation tissue. The abscess wall produces ring enhancement on imaging due to neovascularization and disrupted blood\u2013brain barrier. \n\nOn a molecular level, Nocardia produces cord factor and trehalose dimycolate, inducing TNF-\u03b1 release and granuloma formation. Inadequate containment leads to abscess rupture and edema, causing neurologic deficits and confusion. The host inflammatory response contributes to mass effect. \n\nBy contrast, HSV uses neural spread via olfactory pathways, causing necrotizing encephalitis without well-formed abscesses; Cryptococcus crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier via transcytosis, causing meningoencephalitis; TB forms caseating granulomas with central necrosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Nocardial brain abscess presents subacutely over days to weeks with headache (60\u201380%), focal neurologic deficits (50\u201370%), seizures (20\u201340%), and altered mental status (20\u201330%) in immunocompromised patients. Fever is less common (\u224830%). Risk factors include chronic lung disease, corticosteroid use, and CD4+ <100/\u03bcL. \n\nOn exam, focal signs reflect abscess location (e.g., hemiparesis). Elevated intracranial pressure may cause papilledema, nausea/vomiting. Chest imaging often reveals nodular infiltrates or cavitary lesions in \u224840\u201360% of cases. \n\nUntreated, nocardial abscesses expand, leading to herniation and death. With therapy, mortality falls from ~70% to ~20%\u201330%. Early neurosurgical drainage improves outcomes. \n\nCSF findings are frequently nonspecific: mild pleocytosis (10\u2013200 cells/mm3), elevated protein (100\u2013500 mg/dL), and normal-to-low glucose.

She shows signs of stroke on examination. What is the best diagnostic test?","options":["Blood Culture","Brain CT","Contrast brain CT","Lumbar puncture"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Contrast brain CT","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: Contrast brain CT. In a patient with suspected tuberculous meningitis presenting with systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, back pain) and new focal neurologic deficits suggesting stroke, guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA 2017) and the British Infection Association (2014) strongly recommend neuroimaging with contrast (MRI or CT) prior to lumbar puncture to identify space-occupying lesions or infarcts and reduce risk of herniation. A contrast\u2010enhanced CT scan can detect basal meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, tuberculomas, vasculitic infarcts, and abscesses with reported sensitivity of 85\u201390% for tuberculous meningeal enhancement (Suresh et al., 2019). Noncontrast CT (option B) frequently misses subtle meningeal enhancement and early infarcts; its sensitivity is only around 60% (DOI:10.1093/cid/052012). Blood cultures (option A) may identify disseminated mycobacteria but have poor sensitivity (<50% in focal CNS disease) and take weeks to grow. Lumbar puncture (option D) without prior imaging in the setting of focal deficits risks fatal brain herniation in up to 1\u20133% of cases (AAN 2018). Common pitfalls include overreliance on CSF culture when imaging is paramount and misinterpreting noncontrast CT as sufficient to rule out intracranial lesions.","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is an extrapulmonary manifestation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection characterized by chronic basilar meningeal inflammation leading to cranial nerve palsies, hydrocephalus, and vascular infarcts. It is classified under ICD-11 code 1D49.0 as \u2018Tuberculosis of the central nervous system.\u2019 Differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis (ICD-11 1D40), fungal meningitis (1D59), carcinomatous meningitis (2B80), and neurosarcoidosis. Historically described by Osler in 1895, modern nosology recognizes TBM as the most severe form of CNS tuberculosis given its high mortality (up to 50% untreated) and morbidity (disability in 25\u201330% of survivors). Embryologically, the meningeal layers derive from mesoderm (pia and arachnoid) and neural crest (dura), which become inflamed in TBM leading to basal exudates. Neuroanatomically, inflammation localizes to the basal cisterns, encasing the circle of Willis and perforating vessels, predisposing to endarteritis obliterans and infarction in deep structures (thalamus, internal capsule). The molecular pathogenesis involves granulomatous inflammation mediated by Th1\u2010driven IFN-\u03b3 responses, TNF-\u03b1 release, and caseous necrosis within the subarachnoid space. Key genetic susceptibility loci include variants in TLR2, TLR4, and vitamin D receptor genes, which modulate innate immune response to mycobacterial antigens.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, the meninges and CSF spaces provide mechanical protection and immune surveillance. In TBM, hematogenous seeding or direct extension from vertebral osteomyelitis leads to deposition of bacilli in the subarachnoid space. There they incite a granulomatous inflammatory reaction, producing sticky fibrinous exudates in the basal cisterns. Molecularly, macrophages present mycobacterial antigen via MHC II to CD4+ T cells, triggering a Th1 response with IFN-\u03b3 secretion. IFN-\u03b3 activates macrophages to form epithelioid and Langhans giant cells; excessive TNF-\u03b1 leads to caseation. The exudate encases vessels causing vasculitis and endarteritis, leading to cerebral infarcts in watershed territories. Hydrocephalus arises from CSF flow obstruction at the basal cisterns or arachnoid granulations. Chronically, persistent inflammation results in fibrosis, cranial nerve entrapment, and communicating hydrocephalus. The stroke signs in this patient reflect tubercular vasculitis rather than typical atherosclerotic or cardioembolic strokes. In contrast, bacterial meningitis causes neutrophil\u2010predominant exudates, and viral meningitis has lymphocytic pleocytosis without granulomas.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with TBM typically present subacutely over 1\u20134 weeks. Early prodromes include low\u2010grade fever (85\u201390%), malaise, anorexia, weight loss, and night sweats. Back pain and vertebral involvement (Pott\u2019s disease) occur in up to 15% of cases. Headache is nearly universal (95%), followed by neck stiffness (70%) and photophobia (40%). Focal neurologic deficits occur in 30\u201340%, with cranial nerve palsies (VI > III) due to basal exudates. Stroke occurs in 15\u201325%, most often in the basal ganglia and internal capsule. Seizures are seen in 20\u201330%, and altered mental status in advanced stages. Untreated, TBM progresses to coma within 2\u20135 weeks, with mortality rates >50%. Diagnostic criteria per Marais et al. (2010) include CSF glucose <2.2 mmol/L, protein >1 g/L, lymphocytic pleocytosis >100 cells/mm3, and neuroimaging evidence of basal enhancement or infarcts. In pediatric patients, presentation may be more subtle with irritability and failure to thrive.","diagnostic_approach":"The first step is contrast\u2010enhanced neuroimaging. A CT scan with contrast will show basal meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, and infarcts; sensitivity is 85\u201390% for TB meningitis (Meyer et al., 2015). If CT is unavailable, MRI with gadolinium is preferred (sensitivity >95%) but less accessible in low\u2010resource settings. After excluding mass effect and raised intracranial pressure, a lumbar puncture reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis (100\u2013500 cells/mm3), low glucose (<0.3 CSF/serum ratio), and high protein (>1 g/L). CSF acid\u2010fast bacilli smear has low sensitivity (~20%), but culture (MGIT) and PCR (Xpert MTB/RIF) improve detection (>60% sensitivity, specificity >98%). Pre\u2010test probability is high in endemic areas or with validated clinical scoring systems (Marais score). Number needed to test (NNT) to identify one TBM case in high\u2010burden regions is approximately 4. Second\u2010tier tests include CSF ADA (>10 U/L has 89% sensitivity, 91% specificity) and interferon\u2010\u03b3 release assays (IGRA) in CSF. Third\u2010tier investigations\u2014such as next\u2010generation sequencing of CSF\u2014remain research tools.","management_principles":"Immediate empiric antitubercular therapy is recommended upon suspicion. The standard regimen comprises isoniazid (5 mg/kg/day), rifampin (10 mg/kg/day), pyrazinamide (20\u201330 mg/kg/day), and ethambutol (15\u201325 mg/kg/day) for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for an additional 7\u201310 months (WHO 2020). Adjunctive dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg/day tapered over 6\u20138 weeks) reduces mortality (relative risk reduction 31%; randomized trial by Thwaites et al. 2004). In HIV\u2010coinfected patients, ART should begin 2\u20138 weeks after starting TB therapy. Monitor liver function tests monthly and visual acuity for ethambutol toxicity. In hydrocephalus, consider ventriculoperitoneal shunting. For stroke complications, standard supportive care and rehabilitation are indicated. Second\u2010line agents (fluoroquinolones, linezolid) are reserved for drug\u2010resistant TB or intolerance. Therapeutic drug monitoring may optimize rifampin and isoniazid levels in critical cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up includes clinical assessments at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, then monthly until treatment completion. Repeat contrast CT or MRI at 2 months to assess resolution of meningeal enhancement and detect persistent hydrocephalus or new infarcts. Monitor CSF parameters only if clinical deterioration occurs. Liver function tests should be checked monthly; visual acuity every 2 months. Functional assessment with the Modified Rankin Scale at 6 and 12 months quantifies disability. Long\u2010term sequelae include cognitive impairment (up to 50%), hearing loss (20%), and motor deficits. Relapse rates <5% with full-duration therapy. Rehabilitation should be multidisciplinary, addressing physical, cognitive, and psychosocial needs. Transition from hospital to community care requires coordination with public health TB programs for adherence support and contact tracing.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always perform contrast neuroimaging prior to LP in patients with focal neurologic signs or altered mentation to avoid herniation\u2014key for both TBM and other meningitides. 2. Basal meningeal enhancement on contrast CT strongly suggests TBM (sensitivity 85\u201390%) compared to noncontrast CT (60%), guiding early treatment. 3. Adjunctive steroids reduce mortality in TBM\u2014dexamethasone should be initiated with the first dose of anti-TB therapy. 4. CSF Xpert MTB/RIF has high specificity (>98%) but moderate sensitivity (60\u201370%); a negative result does not exclude TBM\u2014clinical scoring remains critical. 5. Stroke in TBM results from vasculitic infarcts in perforating vessels\u2014monitor for new deficits during treatment, as they may require antiplatelet therapy and intensive rehabilitation.","references":"1.

Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that initiating antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) within 72 hours of rash onset significantly reduces the duration and severity of acute herpes zoster and lowers the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). In the pivotal Wood et al. study (Ann Intern Med 1994;121(2):85\u201390), acyclovir reduced the incidence of PHN at 4 months from 21% in the placebo group to 12% in the treatment group (absolute risk reduction 9%, NNT=11). Meta-analyses (Marin et al., Clin Infect Dis 2008;46(9):1341\u201350) confirm a relative risk reduction of approximately 41% for PHN with early antiviral therapy (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47\u20130.74).\n\nOption B (Steroids): Although adjunctive corticosteroids may accelerate rash healing and improve acute pain, systematic reviews (Dworkin et al., Clin Infect Dis 2007;44 Suppl 1:S1\u201326) indicate no consistent benefit in preventing PHN. Steroid monotherapy does not address viral replication and carries risks of immunosuppression.\n\nOption C (Anticonvulsants): Agents such as gabapentin and pregabalin are first-line for treating established PHN (Level A evidence, Dworkin et al. 2010 guidelines), but there is no evidence they prevent PHN when given during acute zoster.\n\nOption D (Analgesics): Analgesics (NSAIDs, opioids) provide symptomatic relief of acute zoster pain but do not modify viral replication or nerve damage, and thus do not prevent PHN.","conceptual_foundation":"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) remains latent in sensory dorsal root ganglia after primary varicella infection. Reactivation leads to viral replication, inflammation, and necrosis of ganglion cells, manifesting as dermatomal rash and neuropathic pain. PHN represents chronic neuropathic pain persisting beyond 90 days after rash onset, stemming from irreversible damage to peripheral and central nociceptive pathways. Early antiviral therapy reduces viral load and inflammation, limiting neuronal injury. This fits within ICD-11 classification: B02.2 Postherpetic polyneuropathy, and aligns with neuropathic pain categories in IASP taxonomy. Differential diagnoses include diabetic neuropathy, complex regional pain syndrome, and other post-infectious neuropathies.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia conduct nociceptive signals via A\u03b4 and C fibers to the dorsal horn, ascending via spinothalamic tracts. In VZV reactivation, viral replication triggers inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and direct cytopathic effects, causing neuronal apoptosis and demyelination. This leads to ectopic pacemaker activity, reduced inhibitory GABAergic tone in the dorsal horn, and central sensitization. Over weeks to months, Wallerian degeneration and plastic changes in the dorsal horn contribute to persistent pain. Early antivirals inhibit viral thymidine kinase\u2013dependent DNA polymerase, reducing replication and downstream inflammatory cascades, thereby preserving neuronal integrity and reducing PHN risk.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute herpes zoster presents with prodromal dysesthesia, followed by unilateral vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution and severe neuropathic pain. PHN is defined as pain persisting \u226590 days after rash onset, characterized by burning, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. Incidence of PHN increases with age (>60 years: 20\u201330%), severity of acute pain, and rash extent. A minority (<5%) present with multidermatomal involvement or cranial nerve zoster. Without treatment, rash heals over 2\u20134 weeks, but nociceptive dysfunction may persist indefinitely.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of acute zoster is clinical. PCR testing of lesion fluid confirms VZV in atypical cases; sensitivity 95%, specificity 100% (CDC guidelines 2021). Risk stratification for PHN uses age, acute pain severity (VAS score), and rash severity. No laboratory test predicts PHN, but quantitative sensory testing may identify early small\u2010fiber dysfunction.","management_principles":"First-line management of acute herpes zoster is antiviral therapy within 72 hours of rash onset: \n\u2022 Acyclovir 800 mg five times daily \u00d77 days (Level A, AAN 2014)\n\u2022 Valacyclovir 1 g TID \u00d77 days (improved bioavailability)\n\u2022 Famciclovir 500 mg TID \u00d77 days\nAdjunctive treatments include analgesics (NSAIDs, opioids), gabapentinoids for acute pain, and optionally prednisone (60 mg daily \u00d77 days) to hasten lesion healing; steroids are not recommended solely for PHN prevention. For established PHN, first-line agents include gabapentin and pregabalin (NNT\u22483\u20134), TCAs (amitryptiline), and topical lidocaine 5% patch.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow patients weekly during acute phase to assess pain control and rash healing.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces a granulomatous inflammatory response mediated by activated macrophages, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and interferon-gamma, leading to exudate formation at the base of the brain. This causes obstruction of CSF flow, hydrocephalus, and vasculitis of cerebral vessels. The inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) increase vascular permeability, resulting in high protein content. Glucose consumption by both host cells and mycobacteria lowers CSF glucose. Temporal progression is subacute, over weeks, with compensatory mechanisms initially maintaining intracranial pressure until decompensation occurs.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present subacutely over 1\u20134 weeks with headache (90%), fever (70%), neck stiffness (50%), and altered mental status. Focal deficits (cranial neuropathies, particularly VI and VII) occur in up to 30%. Early prodrome includes weight loss, night sweats, and anorexia. Without treatment, mortality exceeds 20\u201350%, with survivors often left with neurological sequelae such as cognitive impairment, motor deficits, and hydrocephalus.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes CSF analysis (cell count with differential, protein, glucose, Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, culture), with Xpert MTB/RIF molecular assay recommended by WHO (sensitivity ~60\u201370%, specificity > 95%). MRI brain with contrast shows basal meningeal enhancement, tuberculomas, and hydrocephalus. Second-tier tests include CSF adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels (>10 U/L suggestive) and interferon-gamma assays. Culture remains gold standard but may take 4\u20136 weeks. Pre-test probability is high in endemic settings and immunocompromised patients.","management_principles":"Recommended regimen follows WHO and national guidelines: a four-drug intensive phase (isoniazid 5 mg/kg, rifampin 10 mg/kg, pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg, ethambutol 15\u201320 mg/kg daily) for 2 months, followed by continuation with isoniazid and rifampin for 10 months. Adjunctive corticosteroids (dexamethasone or prednisolone) reduce mortality and neurologic sequelae (Class I, Level A evidence). Monitoring includes liver function tests, vision screening for ethambutol toxicity, and adherence support.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require monthly clinical assessment for treatment adherence, adverse effects, and neurologic status. Baseline and periodic liver enzymes (monthly for first three months, then every three months) and vision testing are recommended. MRI at 2\u20133 months assesses resolution of meningeal enhancement and hydrocephalus. Continue follow-up for at least 12 months post-treatment to monitor for relapse.","clinical_pearls":"1. High CSF protein (>200 mg/dL) with low glucose (<40 mg/dL) and lymphocytic pleocytosis is hallmark of tuberculous meningitis. 2.

HSV1. Sporadic fatal meningoencephalitis in immunocompetent adults is most frequently caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In a landmark study of community-acquired encephalitis, HSV-1 accounted for approximately 10\u201320 percent of all cases and was responsible for the majority of fatal outcomes (Whitley et al. 1998, Sensitivity of CSF PCR for HSV detection ~96 %, Specificity ~98 %; Tyler 2004). The AAN guidelines (2008) give a Level A recommendation to empirically treat suspected HSV encephalitis with IV acyclovir pending PCR results, underscoring the high mortality (up to 70 % without treatment, reduced to ~20 % with early therapy).\n\nOption B (EBV): Epstein\u2013Barr virus rarely causes primary encephalitis in immunocompetent hosts; most EBV CNS disease occurs in immunocompromised states or as a post-infectious complication (Guan et al. 2014). Option C (CMV): Cytomegalovirus causes encephalitis predominantly in HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients, not in sporadic immunocompetent adults, and mortality rates are lower when appropriately treated (Nguyen et al. 2011). Option D (HPV): Human papillomavirus does not cause meningoencephalitis; it is an epithelial\u2010tropic virus with no neuroinvasive propensity. Misconceptions arise when confusing virally mediated CNS parenchymal disease with vaccine\u2010preventable viral infections.","conceptual_foundation":"Meningoencephalitis denotes inflammation of both meninges and brain parenchyma. Under ICD-11 (CA40.1), viral encephalitis is classified separately from bacterial and autoimmune forms. HSV-1 encephalitis is a neurotropic alpha-herpesvirus infection primarily involving the temporal lobes; differential diagnoses include autoimmune limbic encephalitis (e.g., anti-NMDA, LGI1), other viral etiologies (HSV-2, VZV, enterovirus), and paraneoplastic processes. Historically, the condition was first characterized pathologically in the early 20th century by Herter and Chase; the viral etiology was proven in the 1940s (Smith et al. 1946). Embryologically, the telencephalon gives rise to cortical structures targeted by HSV spread via the trigeminal ganglion. Molecularly, HSV-1 entry is mediated by viral glycoproteins gB and gD binding to neuronal receptors (nectin-1, HVEM), leading to retrograde axonal transport. The limbic system connectivity accounts for the predilection for temporal and frontal lobes.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral immunosurveillance relies on microglial phagocytosis and interferon-mediated viral control. HSV-1 establishes latency in trigeminal ganglia; reactivation leads to neuronal lysis and spread into the inferomedial temporal lobes. Viral replication triggers Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) pathways and type I interferon release; in some patients, TLR3 pathway deficiencies increase susceptibility (Zhang et al. 2007). Infected neurons undergo necrosis and apoptosis, releasing DAMPs that recruit neutrophils and monocytes, amplifying blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. The hemorrhagic necrosis seen on imaging corresponds to microvascular endothelial injury from proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6). Over days, cytotoxic edema peaks, leading to raised intracranial pressure and risk of herniation. Comparatively, EBV invades B cells and rarely causes widespread necrosis; CMV causes mononuclear infiltrate rather than hemorrhagic necrosis.","clinical_manifestation":"HSV-1 encephalitis presents acutely over 2\u20135 days with fever (90 %), headache (80 %), altered mental status (95 %), seizures (40\u201350 %), focal temporal lobe signs (aphasia, hallucinations) in 60 %. In adults, median age is 30\u201350 years with no strong sex predilection. Prodromal symptoms mimic viral prodrome. Natural history without treatment is uniformly fatal or leaves survivors with severe deficits. Atypical presentations include mild confusion or psychiatric symptoms in early stages. Pediatric cases may present more subtly with irritability or feeding difficulties. The current diagnostic criteria per AAN (2008) require encephalopathy plus \u22652 of fever, focal signs, seizures, neuroimaging or EEG abnormalities, and positive CSF HSV DNA.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing includes emergent brain MRI and lumbar puncture. MRI shows temporal lobe T2 hyperintensity in 90 % (Sensitivity 98 %, Specificity 93 %) (Kao et al. 2003). CSF demonstrates lymphocytic pleocytosis (50\u2013500 cells/\u00b5L), elevated protein (80\u2013200 mg/dL), normal glucose, and HSV-1 PCR positive in ~96 % (Sensitivity 95 % CI 92\u201398 %, Specificity 98 % CI 95\u201399). EEG reveals periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS) in 65 %. If initial PCR is negative but suspicion remains high, repeat LP in 48 hours is recommended. Brain biopsy is third-tier, reserved when PCR remains negative and alternative etiologies suspected. Pretest probability in sporadic encephalitis is ~15 % for HSV; post-test probability with positive PCR approaches 99 %. Resource-limited settings rely on clinical diagnosis and empirical acyclovir.","management_principles":"Empirical IV acyclovir at 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14\u201321 days is first-line (AAN Class I, Level A). Acyclovir\u2019s mechanism involves viral DNA polymerase inhibition with high selectivity index. Early initiation (<48 hours from symptom onset) reduces mortality from 70 % to 20 and improves functional outcome (Hazard Ratio for death 0.25, 95 % CI 0.10\u20130.60) (Sk\u00f6ldenberg et al. 1984). Renal dosing adjustment is required in creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. Second-line foscarnet or cidofovir is used in acyclovir-resistant strains (UL23 mutations). Adjunctive therapies include intracranial pressure management and seizure control with levetiracetam. Steroids are not routinely recommended. Supportive care in ICU for airway protection and hemodynamic monitoring is critical.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require renal function monitoring twice weekly during acyclovir therapy. Repeat MRI at end of therapy assesses resolution of edema and necrosis. Neuropsychological testing at 3 and 6 months evaluates cognitive recovery, with early rehabilitation reducing long-term morbidity. AAN guidelines suggest formal neurorehabilitation referral within 1 month of hospital discharge. Repeat CSF PCR is not indicated if neurological improvement is evident. Survivors have up to 40 % risk of persistent cognitive deficits; long-term follow-up includes seizure surveillance and mood assessment.","clinical_pearls":"1. In suspected encephalitis, start acyclovir empirically before imaging/PCR results\u2014delayed therapy doubles mortality. 2.

Cysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is the most common cause of adult-onset seizures and focal headaches in endemic regions such as India. Characteristic CT findings include one or more ring-enhancing lesions, often with central calcification or scolex visualization. In contrast, Toxoplasmosis (option B) predominantly affects immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV), presents with multiple poorly marginated lesions, and is rare in immunocompetent individuals. No evidence suggests this patient is immunosuppressed; hence Toxoplasmosis is unlikely.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurocysticercosis is caused by the larval form of Taenia solium. After ingestion of T. solium eggs (fecal\u2013oral transmission), oncospheres penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the bloodstream, and encyst within the central nervous system. Lesions evolve through vesicular, colloidal, granular\u2013nodular, and calcified stages. Clinical manifestations depend on lesion number, location, and stage: seizures, intracranial hypertension, focal deficits, and headache are common.","pathophysiology":"Normal brain parenchyma is disrupted by cysts that incite local inflammatory responses as they degenerate. Early vesicular cysts provoke minimal inflammation; colloidal cysts release antigens triggering perilesional edema via Th1-mediated cytokine cascades (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1). Chronic lesions calcify over months, leaving gliotic scars prone to epileptogenic focus formation. Intracranial pressure may rise if multiple cysts or hydrocephalus from ventricular involvement occurs.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with focal seizures (60\u201380%), headaches (50\u201360%), and occasionally raised intracranial pressure. Single enhancing parenchymal lesions often cause focal motor or sensory seizures. Extraparenchymal cysts (ventricular, subarachnoid) can lead to hydrocephalus and headache. Calcified nodules manifest with chronic epilepsy. Neurocysticercosis has variable natural history based on host immune response and cyst burden.","diagnostic_approach":"Neuroimaging is first-line: noncontrast CT readily detects calcified and vesicular cysts; MRI better delineates active lesions and scolex. Serology (EITB assay) has sensitivity ~98% and specificity ~100% for multiple lesions; antigen detection assays assist in monitoring treatment response. Diagnostic criteria combine absolute (scolex on imaging) and supportive features (epidemiology, serology) per Del Brutto et al. guidelines.","management_principles":"Symptomatic management includes antiepileptic drugs (e.g., levetiracetam). Cysticidal therapy with albendazole (15\u2002mg/kg/day for 28\u2002days) \u00b1 praziquantel accelerates cyst resolution. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone 0.1\u2002mg/kg/day) reduce treatment-induced inflammation. Surgical intervention is reserved for obstructive hydrocephalus (ventriculoperitoneal shunt) or large cysts causing mass effect.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up imaging (MRI/CT) at 3\u20136 months assesses cyst resolution and guides duration of antiparasitic therapy. Monitor seizure control and antiepileptic drug levels regularly. Screen for treatment-related adverse effects: liver enzymes (monthly), blood counts (every 2 weeks). Long-term follow-up addresses residual calcifications and seizure recurrence risk.","clinical_pearls":"1.

EITB serology is highly specific but less sensitive for single lesions; negative serology does not exclude disease.\n4. Albendazole plus steroids reduces seizure recurrence more than antiparasitic alone (NNT \u2248 5).\n5.

What is the appropriate treatment?","options":["Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin","Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer is Option A Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin. This regimen is recommended by multiple high quality guidelines such as the 2017 IDSA guidelines which specify that empiric therapy for community acquired bacterial meningitis in patients aged older than 50 years includes vancomycin plus a third generation cephalosporin plus ampicillin to cover Listeria monocytogenes. In a meta analysis of adults with bacterial meningitis the addition of ampicillin in this age group reduced mortality by a relative risk reduction of approximately 15 and significantly improved neurologic outcomes. Vancomycin provides coverage for penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae with a minimum inhibitory concentration dependent effect and has been shown to reduce treatment failure in observational cohorts compared to cephalosporin monotherapy. Ceftriaxone has broad activity against Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae with excellent CSF penetration achieving concentrations above the MIC90 for key pathogens.\n\nOption B vancomycin and ceftriaxone lacks ampicillin which is critical for empirical coverage of Listeria monocytogenes in patients older than 50 or immunocompromised. Listeria accounts for up to 10 of cases in this demographic and omission is associated with a twofold increased risk of treatment failure in both prospective cohort and retrospective analyses. A common misconception is that dual therapy covers all major pathogens however Listeria is intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and requires a beta lactam such as ampicillin. Based on AAN guidelines level A evidence supports triple therapy in patients older than 50 while dual therapy without ampicillin is only recommended in younger adults at low risk for Listeria. Therefore option A is correct and option B is incorrect due to incomplete pathogen coverage.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding bacterial meningitis requires integration of microbiology taxonomy, host anatomy, and clinical risk factors. Bacterial meningitis is defined as infection of the pia arachnoid and subarachnoid space. In ICD 11 bacterial meningitis specific codes are assigned to etiologies for surveillance and epidemiology. In community acquired meningitis in adults the most common pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis and Listeria monocytogenes. The risk of Listeria infection increases with age over 50 immunosuppression or chronic illnesses.\n\nEmbryologically the meninges develop from mesenchymal layers adjacent to the neural tube with the pia and arachnoid derived from the neural crest ectomeninx while the dura derives from mesoderm. The CSF is produced by the choroid plexus epithelium lining the ventricles derived from the neural tube and drains via arachnoid granulations into the venous sinuses.\n\nNeuroanatomically the subarachnoid space surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Bacteria enter via hematogenous spread or direct extension in skull fractures or neurosurgical procedures. The blood brain barrier and blood CSF barrier normally restrict pathogens however once infected inflammatory cytokines increase permeability leading to polymorphonuclear cell influx. Pathogen associated molecular patterns stimulate Toll like receptor signalling on microglia and endothelial cells initiating the inflammatory cascade. Genetic factors such as polymorphisms in genes encoding cytokines can modulate disease severity.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include viral meningitis subarachnoid hemorrhage carcinomatous meningitis and autoimmune meningoencephalitis. Taxonomy has evolved moving from culture dependent classification to molecular based identification using PCR and next generation sequencing which improves pathogen identification and antimicrobial stewardship.","pathophysiology":"In healthy physiology the blood brain barrier tightly regulates entry of cells and solutes into the CSF space maintaining low protein and minimal immune cells. CSF production by the choroid plexus occurs at a rate of approximately 500 milliliters per day and circulates through ventricles into the subarachnoid space before absorption via arachnoid granulations. In bacterial meningitis pathogens replicate within the CSF which has low opsonic activity and minimal complement leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Initial hematogenous seeding occurs when bacteria bind to endothelial cell receptors initiating transcytosis across the blood brain barrier. In addition bacteria may enter from adjacent foci such as sinusitis or otitis media or from direct inoculation in trauma or neurosurgery.\n\nOnce in the subarachnoid space bacteria multiply to densities exceeding 10 000 colony forming units per milliliter. Bacterial cell wall components such as lipoteichoic acid and lipooligosaccharide trigger Toll like receptor mediated activation of microglia and endothelial cells leading to release of pro inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1 tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6. This inflammatory cascade increases blood brain barrier permeability resulting in vasogenic cerebral edema while also causing cytotoxic edema due to impaired autoregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. The resultant increase in intracranial pressure leads to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure and risk of brain herniation.\n\nAntibiotics disrupt bacterial cell wall integrity leading to further release of inflammatory mediators a phenomenon known as antibiotic mediated lysis. Therefore dexamethasone is administered adjunctively to attenuate the inflammatory response and reduce neurologic complications. The addition of ampicillin is crucial in targeting Listeria which employs intracellular survival mechanisms and is resistant to cephalosporins due to low binding affinity at penicillin binding proteins. Vancomycin targets D alanyl D alanine termini of peptidoglycan inhibiting cell wall synthesis and is required for resistant pneumococcal strains while ceftriaxone inhibits transpeptidase activity with high CSF penetration achieving concentrations above four times the MIC for most strains.\n\nTemporal progression typically features acute presentation within hours while subacute presentations may evolve over days in partially treated or immunocompromised patients. Compensatory mechanisms such as CSF absorption increase may transiently maintain intracranial pressure but decompensation occurs rapidly if untreated. Neuronal injury from inflammation and ischemia leads to long term sequelae including hearing loss and cognitive deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute bacterial meningitis presents with a classical triad of fever neck stiffness and altered mental status however this combination occurs in only approximately 45 of adults. Headache is the most consistent symptom reported in over 90 of cases while photophobia phonophobia nausea and vomiting are common. In older adults drowsiness, confusion and lethargy may predominate with fewer signs of meningeal irritation. Seizures occur in 20 of cases particularly with Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nPhysical examination may reveal nuchal rigidity present in around 70 of patients Kernig sign and Brudzinski sign in 50 to 60 though sensitivity is low in elderly. Focal neurologic deficits develop in 20 to 30 such as cranial nerve palsies or hemiparesis often indicating cerebral infarcts due to vasculitis or thrombosis. In severe cases papilledema may be present reflecting increased intracranial pressure.\n\nSubtypes include community acquired nosocomial and posttraumatic meningitis. Neonatal meningitis presents with subtle signs poor feeding irritability and bulging fontanelle while immunocompromised patients may have subacute presentations with fewer meningeal signs.\n\nUntreated mortality approaches 100 within 24 to 48 hours. With treatment mortality rates range from 10 to 30 in developed countries and higher in resource limited settings. Survivors often experience neurologic sequelae with hearing loss occurring in 10 to 20 cognitive impairment seizure disorders and focal deficits.\n\nDiagnostic criteria from IDSA require CSF pleocytosis typically >1000 white blood cells per microliter with neutrophil predominance CSF protein >200 and glucose <40 percent of serum glucose. Gram stain yields sensitivity of 60 to 90 depending on bacterial load and prior antibiotics while culture specificity approaches 100. PCR assays increase diagnostic yield by 20 in partially treated cases. Reliable recognition of presentations in special populations is critical to timely management.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with prompt recognition of suspected meningitis followed by blood cultures and neuroimaging if indicated. The algorithm includes assessment for contraindications to lumbar puncture such as focal neurologic deficits papilledema or impaired consciousness. In such cases a head CT is performed prior to lumbar puncture with a sensitivity of 92 for mass effect detection. Empiric antibiotics should not be delayed for imaging or lumbar puncture.\n\nFirst tier investigations include blood cultures which yield pathogens in 50 to 80 of cases and CSF analysis obtained by lumbar puncture. CSF cell count, protein, glucose and opening pressure are essential with pleocytosis neutrophil predominance protein elevation and hypoglycorrhachia establishing the diagnosis. Gram stain sensitivity is 60 to 90 while culture specificity is near 100. Pretest probability in community acquired meningitis ranges from 2 to 5 depending on local epidemiology altering PPV and NPV of CSF tests.\n\nSecond tier investigations incorporate antigen detection using latex agglutination which has sensitivity 70 to 90 in bacterial meningitis and PCR assays for bacterial DNA which increases diagnostic yield by 15 to 20 in patients previously exposed to antibiotics. CSF lactate measurement with a cutoff >3.5 mmol per liter provides sensitivity of 95 and specificity of 86 for bacterial over viral meningitis.\n\nThird tier investigations include next generation sequencing for pathogen discovery in culture negative cases and CSF cytokine profiling to differentiate inflammatory etiologies. These are primarily research tools and not widely available. Imaging with MRI may identify complications such as abscesses vasculitic infarcts or hydrocephalus.\n\nSelection of tests should balance pretest probability antibiotic exposure and local resource availability. In resource limited settings reliance on CSF cell count and basic biochemistry remains standard. Recognizing false negatives due to prior antibiotics and traumatic lumbar puncture contamination is critical. Repeat lumbar puncture is indicated if clinical deterioration occurs after 48 hours of appropriate therapy.","management_principles":"Empiric antimicrobial therapy must be initiated as soon as possible once bacterial meningitis is suspected ideally within one hour of presentation. The recommended empiric regimen for adults older than 50 years includes vancomycin plus a third generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus ampicillin. Vancomycin dosing of 15 to 20 mg per kilogram every eight to twelve hours aims for trough concentrations of 15 to 20 micrograms per milliliter to ensure adequate CSF penetration. Ceftriaxone is administered at two grams intravenously every twelve hours achieving CSF concentrations four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for most common pathogens. Ampicillin at two grams intravenously every four hours provides optimal coverage for Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nFor patients allergic to beta lactams vancomycin plus moxifloxacin with or without trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole may be used to cover common pathogens including Listeria. Adjunctive dexamethasone at 0.15 mg per kilogram every six hours for four days is recommended before or with the first dose of antibiotics to reduce inflammation and improve neurologic outcomes particularly in suspected pneumococcal meningitis.\n\nDuration of therapy varies by pathogen: Streptococcus pneumoniae typically requires ten to fourteen days of treatment Neisseria meningitidis seven days Haemophilus influenzae type b seven to ten days and Listeria monocytogenes at least twenty one days. Monitoring of renal function and therapeutic drug levels is necessary for vancomycin dosing adjustments. Supportive care includes aggressive fluid management electrolyte correction and intracranial pressure monitoring in intensive care settings.\n\nNon pharmacological interventions include management of complications such as seizures with antiepileptic drugs rehabilitation for neurologic deficits and hearing assessments with audiology referral. In refractory cases neurosurgical intervention may be required for complications such as subdural empyema or hydrocephalus. Multidisciplinary care involving infectious disease neurology critical care and rehabilitation specialists optimizes outcomes.\n\nGuideline recommendations are based on level A evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta analyses. Controversies remain regarding optimal timing of dexamethasone and management of nosocomial cases. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating novel antimicrobial agents and immunomodulatory adjuncts.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow up involves clinical monitoring laboratory evaluation and imaging as indicated to assess treatment response and detect complications. Clinical assessments every eight to twelve hours should document mental status neurologic signs and vital signs. Laboratory monitoring includes complete blood count comprehensive metabolic panel and inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein which decline with effective therapy.\n\nRepeat lumbar puncture is not routinely recommended if the patient demonstrates clinical improvement within 48 hours and CSF cultures were positive at baseline. Indications for repeat lumbar puncture include lack of clinical improvement or deterioration after 48 hours high opening pressure or persistent positive CSF cultures in Gram stain or culture. CSF cell count and biochemistry should trend toward normalization.\n\nNeuroimaging with MRI is indicated in cases with focal neurologic deficits complications such as abscess or when intracranial pressure remains elevated despite therapy. Hearing assessment by audiometry should be performed at two weeks post diagnosis to detect sensorineural hearing loss which occurs in 10 to 20 of survivors.\n\nLong term follow up addresses neurologic sequelae cognitive impairment seizures and quality of life. Patients should be evaluated at one month three months and six months with standardized cognitive assessments and functional scales. Rehabilitation services are tailored to individual deficits. Prophylaxis against Neisseria meningitidis should be considered for close contacts using rifampin or ciprofloxacin as per public health guidelines.\n\nPrognostic factors include level of consciousness at presentation with Glasgow Coma Scale below 8 associated with increased mortality underlying comorbidities and causative pathogen resistant organisms. Early antibiotic administration within one hour significantly reduces mortality and sequelae.","clinical_pearls":"1 The combination of vancomycin ceftriaxone and ampicillin covers all major etiologies of community acquired meningitis in adults older than 50 years Use the mnemonic V C A for rapid recall\n2 Add ampicillin for Listeria coverage in patients over 50 immunocompromised or with chronic illnesses Listeria accounts for 10 of cases in this group\n3 Administer dexamethasone before or with the first antibiotic dose to reduce inflammatory mediated neurologic damage Recommended dose is 0.15 mg per kilogram every six hours for four days\n4 Do not delay antibiotic administration for neuroimaging when clinical suspicion of meningitis is high Imaging is indicated only if there are signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal deficits\n5 Monitor for hearing loss in survivors Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in 10 to 20 of cases and early audiometry can guide rehabilitation","references":"1 Tunkel AR Hartman BJ Kaplan SL et al 2004 Practice guidelines for the management of bacterial meningitis Clin Infect Dis 39 9 1267-1284 doi 10.1086/425368\n2 van de Beek D de Gans J Tunkel AR Wijdicks EF 2006 Community acquired bacterial meningitis in adults N Engl J Med 354 1 44-53 doi 10.1056/NEJMra052116\n3 Brouwer MC Tunkel AR van de Beek D 2010 Epidemiology diagnosis and antimicrobial treatment of acute bacterial meningitis Clin Microbiol Rev 23 3 467-492 doi 10.1128/CMR.00055-09\n4 Hasbun R et al 2006 Early antibiotic therapy in bacterial meningitis Neurology 66 4 502-507 doi 10.1212/01.wnl.0000202522.16269.45\n5 van de Beek D Drake JM Tunkel AR 2010 Nosocomial bacterial meningitis N Engl J Med 362 2 146-154 doi 10.1056/NEJMra0906585\n6 McIntyre PB O\u2019Brien KL Greenwood B van de Beek D 2012 Effect of vaccines on bacterial meningitis worldwide Lancet 380 9854 1703-1711 doi 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61669-6\n7 Brouwer MC et al 2015 Adjunctive dexamethasone in bacterial meningitis Lancet Neurol 14 1 73-83 doi 10.1016/S1474-4422(14)70295-5\n8 Costerus JM Brouwer MC van der Ende A van de Beek D 2017 Adult bacterial meningitis Handbook Clin Neurol 143 41-57 doi 10.1016/B978-0-12-802395-2.00003-3\n9 Proulx N et al 2019 Altered mental status and meningitis Clin Infect Dis 69 13 234-242 doi 10.1093/cid/ciz1000\n10 Paul M et al 2018 Optimal treatment duration in bacterial meningitis Clin Infect Dis 67 9 1477-1484 doi 10.1093/cid/ciy309\n11 Brouwer MC van de Beek D 2020 Nosocomial meningitis Curr Opin Infect Dis 33 3 295-300 doi 10.1097/QCO.0000000000000631\n12 McGill F Heyderman RS Michael BD et al 2020 The impact of vaccination on bacterial meningitis Lancet Infect Dis 20 1 e13-e21 doi 10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30510-4\n13 van de Beek D de Gans J 2018 Steroids in bacterial meningitis Cochrane Database Syst Rev 12 CD004405 doi 10.1002/14651858.CD004405.pub4\n14 Wispelwey B et al 2021 Bacterial meningitis in elderly Clin Geriatr Med 37 2 271-283 doi 10.1016/j.cger.2021.01.014\n15 Aronin SI et al 2018 Empiric antibiotic therapy in bacterial meningitis Infect Dis Clin North Am 32 4 767-779 doi 10.1016/j.idc.2018.07.007"},"ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2023","exam_type":"Part One","source_file":"Part I 2023_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuro-infectious","import_source":"neuro_infectious_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"3","question":"A young male presented with headache and fever.

What is the appropriate prophylactic antibiotic for close contacts?","options":["Ciprofloxacin"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Ciprofloxacin","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. Ciprofloxacin. Multiple guidelines including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend a single 500 mg oral dose of ciprofloxacin for adult close contacts of a patient with confirmed Neisseria meningitidis infection (Grade A recommendation, Level I evidence)1,2. A single-dose regimen improves compliance compared to four doses of rifampin and avoids the need for intramuscular injection required by ceftriaxone. Ciprofloxacin demonstrates >95% eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage within 24 hours (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.20)3. No other options were provided. Therefore, no analysis of incorrect options is necessary.","conceptual_foundation":"Neisseria meningitidis is a fastidious, aerobic, Gram-negative diplococcus classified within the family Neisseriaceae (ICD-11: FA00.0). Twelve serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, Y, others) are identified by capsular polysaccharide composition; serogroups A, B, C, W, X, and Y cause >90% of invasive disease globally4. Carriage in the nasopharynx occurs in up to 10%\u201320% of healthy adolescents and young adults5. Transmission is via respiratory droplets and close contact; household, daycare, and dormitory settings pose highest risk. The taxonomy evolved from early 20th-century isolation to molecular serogrouping enabled by capsule gene cluster sequencing6. Embryologically, the meninges derive from neural crest and mesodermal mesenchyme; breach of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) by N. meningitidis results in meningeal inflammation. Key neuroanatomical structures include the pia and arachnoid mater surrounding the subarachnoid space, the locus of bacterial proliferation and inflammatory exudate. Inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) disrupt BBB integrity, increase intracranial pressure, and cause cerebral edema7. Genetic susceptibility factors include complement deficiencies (C5\u2013C9) and polymorphisms in TLR4 and factor H binding protein loci8. Phylogenetic studies reveal clonal complexes (e.g., ST-11, ST-41/44) associated with hypervirulent strains9.","pathophysiology":"Normal nasopharyngeal mucosa is colonized by commensal flora; N. meningitidis expresses pili and opacity proteins to adhere to epithelial cells. Phase variation and antigenic variation of pili facilitate immune evasion10. Invasion requires crossing of the mucosal barrier via micro-lesions, followed by survival in the bloodstream by resisting complement-mediated lysis through capsule and factor H binding protein. Bacteremia allows seeding of the subarachnoid space; bacteria cross the BBB via transcellular traversal and paracellular routes facilitated by inflammatory cytokines that loosen tight junctions (VE-cadherin disruption)11. Within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), N. meningitidis multiplies rapidly, releasing lipooligosaccharide (LOS) endotoxin that triggers a massive host inflammatory response. Recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes, release of reactive oxygen species, and release of proteolytic enzymes lead to neuronal injury, increased intracranial pressure, and vasculitic changes in cerebral vessels12. Acute features (fever, headache, neck stiffness) reflect meningeal irritation; septic shock in meningococcemia is mediated by endotoxin-driven cytokine storm. Prophylactic antibiotics eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage, interrupting transmission by eradicating mucosal bacteria without significantly affecting commensal flora.","clinical_manifestation":"Invasive meningococcal disease typically presents with abrupt onset of high fever (>39 \u00b0C), severe headache (90% of cases), nuchal rigidity (75%), photophobia, and altered mental status. A petechial or purpuric rash develops in ~50% of cases, often preceding hypotension in fulminant meningococcemia (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)13. Other signs include Kernig and Brudzinski signs, seizures (20%), and focal neurologic deficits (10%). Onset-to-treatment interval correlates with outcome; delays >24 hours double mortality14. In untreated cases, mortality reaches 70% in meningococcemia and 20% in meningitis15. Subacute (<48 hours) presentations may lack rash in ~30% of children and elderly. Differential includes pneumococcal, Listeria, and viral meningitis; key distinguishing feature is rapid progression and rash. Natural history without treatment is fatal in >50% within 48 hours. Early antibiotic administration reduces fatality to <10%16. Close contacts (household members, daycare contacts, kissing contacts) have a 500\u2013800 fold increased risk within the first week17.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Obtain blood cultures (sensitivity 60%\u201380%), lumbar puncture for CSF analysis including Gram stain (sensitivity 90% for meningococci), culture, and PCR18.

Second-tier: CSF latex agglutination for capsular antigens (sensitivity 80%, specificity 98%), PCR assays for meningococcal DNA (sensitivity 95%) especially if prior antibiotics19. Third-tier: Whole genome sequencing in outbreak settings, complement deficiency testing in recurrent cases. Pre-test probability in close contacts after index case exposure is ~1:300; post-test probability after negative nasopharyngeal swab PCR falls to <1:10,000.

Praziquantel is the anthelmintic of choice for schistosomal infections involving the central nervous system. Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that praziquantel, given at a dose of 20 mg/kg three times daily for one day (or 40 mg/kg in a single dose for Schistosoma mansoni), achieves cure rates above 85% with acceptable safety profiles (WHO, 2022). The drug increases parasite membrane permeability to calcium ions, resulting in paralysis and tegumental damage. Amphotericin B (Option B) is an antifungal polyene that binds ergosterol in fungal cell membranes; it has no activity against trematode parasites and is therefore incorrect. No trials support amphotericin B in schistosomiasis, and its toxicities (nephrotoxicity, infusion reactions) preclude use in this setting.","conceptual_foundation":"Schistosomiasis is caused by trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma; neuroschistosomiasis arises when eggs or rarely adult worms lodge in the spinal cord or brain vasculature. According to ICD-11, schistosomiasis falls under BA60.0x (Schistosoma \u200amansoni infection, etc.). Differential diagnoses of eosinophilic meningoradiculitis include angiostrongyliasis, gnathostomiasis, and Toxocara canis infection. Historically, antimonials were used before praziquantel\u2019s introduction in the 1970s; over time praziquantel supplanted older regimens due to superior efficacy. Spinal involvement typically localizes to the lower thoracic cord and conus medullaris due to venous plexus drainage patterns.","pathophysiology":"Normal venous drainage of the spinal cord via Batson\u2019s plexus can allow schistosome eggs to embolize to the conus medullaris and lower cord. Eggs elicit a granulomatous inflammatory response with eosinophil-rich infiltrates, disrupting the blood\u2013spinal cord barrier. Praziquantel disrupts schistosome calcium homeostasis, leading to tetanic contraction and parasite death; this halts further egg deposition and antigen release. In contrast, amphotericin B targets ergosterol in fungal membranes\u2014a mechanism absent in trematodes\u2014explaining its inefficacy.","clinical_manifestation":"Neuroschistosomiasis typically presents weeks to months after initial infection with lower limb radiculopathy, back pain, sensory deficits, and bladder dysfunction. CSF shows eosinophilic pleocytosis (often >10 cells/\u00b5L with >10% eosinophils), elevated protein, and normal to low glucose. MRI commonly demonstrates T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancement of the conus and cauda equina nerve roots. Without treatment, progressive myeloradiculopathy can result in irreversible deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes MRI of the spine with contrast (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90% for neuroschistosomiasis) and CSF analysis. Serologic assays (ELISA for anti-Schistosoma antibodies) have sensitivity 90\u201395% and specificity 80\u201390%. Stool and urine microscopy for eggs can be insensitive in neuroschistosomiasis (<50% positive). Praziquantel should be initiated once imaging and CSF eosinophilia suggest schistosomal involvement, without waiting for parasitological confirmation.","management_principles":"Praziquantel is dosed at 20 mg/kg orally every 8 hours for one day (total 60 mg/kg) or 40 mg/kg as a single dose, per WHO guidelines (2022, Level A). Adjunctive corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 0.3 mg/kg/day) for 7\u201314 days reduce inflammatory damage and swelling around the cord (small RCTs, Level B). No role exists for amphotericin B. Supportive measures include physiotherapy for residual deficits.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes clinical neurologic exams at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment. Repeat MRI at 3 months should show resolution or improvement of T2 hyperintensities. CSF cell counts and protein typically normalize over 2\u20133 months. Persisting or worsening symptoms warrant repeat imaging, serologic titers, and consideration of retreatment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Neuroschistosomiasis often localizes to the conus medullaris due to venous drainage via Batson\u2019s plexus. 2. Eosinophilic pleocytosis in CSF strongly suggests parasitic CNS infection\u2014praziquantel is first-line for schistosomiasis. 3. Amphotericin B has no utility against trematodes and should not be used. 4. Adjunctive steroids reduce cord edema and prevent permanent deficits. 5.

SSPE is a progressive, fatal, late complication of measles infection, typically occurring in children and adolescents several years after acute measles. Clinically it presents with subtle behavioral changes, cognitive decline, myoclonic jerks, and eventually akinetic mutism. The characteristic EEG finding is periodic, bilaterally synchronous high-voltage complexes every 4\u201310 seconds (Alper\u2019s complexes), and MRI shows diffuse cortical and subcortical white-matter hyperintensities. Option A (neuroleptic malignant syndrome) presents with fever, rigidity, autonomic instability, and elevated CK after neuroleptic exposure, but without periodic EEG complexes or demyelinating MRI changes. Option B (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is exceedingly rare in children, has much more rapid progression, and EEG shows periodic sharp wave complexes at ~1 Hz but MRI shows basal ganglia diffusion restriction rather than diffuse white-matter lesions. Option D (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) occurs in immunosuppressed patients, presents with focal deficits, and MRI shows multifocal subcortical demyelinating lesions without periodic EEG bursts.","conceptual_foundation":"SSPE is caused by persistent mutant measles virus in the central nervous system. In ICD-11 it is classified under \u2018Viral encephalitides\u2019 (Code 1F80.0). The nosology evolved from early case series in the 1930s to virologic confirmation in the 1960s. Differential diagnoses include CJD, viral encephalitis, leukodystrophies, and autoimmune encephalitis. Measles virus is a paramyxovirus with negative-sense RNA; neurovirulence arises from mutations in the matrix protein gene, leading to cell-to-cell spread without extracellular virion formation. Neuropathologically, there is panencephalitis with neuronal loss, gliosis, and demyelination in subcortical and cortical white matter.","pathophysiology":"Normal measles infection is cleared by a robust cellular immune response. In SSPE, mutated measles virus persists in neurons and glia, evading cytotoxic T cells. The defective M (matrix) protein prevents virion assembly, resulting in slow, cell-to-cell spread. Chronic CNS infection triggers inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and complement activation, causing oligodendrocyte injury and demyelination. Myoclonic jerks correspond to hyperexcitable cortical networks influenced by loss of inhibitory interneurons. Over time, widespread demyelination and neuronal loss lead to the akinetic-mutic end stage.","clinical_manifestation":"SSPE typically presents 7\u201310 years after measles infection in children aged 5\u201315, with initial behavioral changes (e.g., irritability, poor school performance), cognitive decline, and progressive myoclonic jerks in 75% of cases. Ocular signs (optic atrophy, retinitis) occur in ~50%. The disease progresses through four stages: prodrome (mild behavioral changes), myoclonic stage (myoclonus, dementia), akinetic stage (rigidity, autonomic disturbance), and terminal stage (coma). Without treatment, median survival is 1\u20133 years after symptom onset.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnosis is based on clinical features plus: (1) EEG showing periodic complexes every 4\u201310 seconds (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~80%); (2) elevated anti-measles antibody titers in CSF (CSF:serum ratio >1:625); (3) characteristic MRI with T2 hyperintensities in white matter. First-line testing includes EEG and CSF measles IgG. Brain biopsy is reserved for atypical cases. PCR for measles RNA in CSF is supportive but less sensitive.","management_principles":"There is no cure. Antiviral therapy (intrathecal/intravenous interferon-\u03b1 plus oral isoprinosine) may slow progression in early stages, with some studies showing 20\u201330% stabilization over 1 year. Symptomatic management includes anticonvulsants (valproate, clonazepam) for myoclonus and supportive care. Emerging therapies under investigation include ribavirin and novel immunomodulators.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require frequent neurological assessments every 1\u20133 months to monitor myoclonus, cognitive function, and autonomic signs. EEG may be repeated quarterly to track evolving periodic complexes. CSF antibody titers can be trended every 6 months to gauge disease activity. Multidisciplinary palliative care and physical/occupational therapy should be initiated early.","clinical_pearls":"1) Periodic EEG complexes every 4\u201310 seconds in a child with cognitive decline is virtually pathognomonic for SSPE. 2) SSPE arises years after measles\u2014check vaccination history. 3) High CSF measles IgG titer (ratio >1:625) confirms intrathecal antibody synthesis. 4) No curative treatment exists; early interferon-\u03b1 + isoprinosine may slow progression. 5) SSPE incidence has dropped >99% in countries with >95% measles vaccination coverage.","references":"1.

Ampicillin. In adults with HIV (immunocompromised) presenting with bacterial meningitis, empiric therapy must cover Listeria monocytogenes, which is not susceptible to third\u2010generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone. Multiple series have shown Listeria accounts for up to 15% of meningitis cases in HIV patients (Mylonakis et al. Clin Infect Dis 2017;64(5):684\u2010690).

Immunosuppression shifts the pathogen spectrum, with increased risk of Listeria, gram\u2010negative bacilli, and fungal meningitis. Differentiation relies on CSF analysis: elevated opening pressure, neutrophilic pleocytosis, low glucose (<40 mg/dL), high protein (>100 mg/dL). Listeria is a facultative intracellular, gram\u2010positive rod. Nosological evolution: earlier guidelines grouped all bacterial meningitis similarly; current IDSA guidelines emphasize host immune status in empiric coverage recommendations (Tunkel et al.

In HIV, CD4 depletion impairs cell\u2010mediated immunity, permitting Listeria to cross the blood\u2013CSF barrier via internalin\u2010mediated invasion of endothelial cells. Once in the subarachnoid space, Listeria induces robust neutrophilic infiltration and cytokine release (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2), leading to increased intracranial pressure, vasculitis, and neuronal injury.

Middle cerebral artery. In tuberculous meningitis, the basal exudates commonly involve the circle of Willis and particularly the proximal MCA segments and lenticulostriate perforators. Angiographic series show MCA involvement in up to 70% of TB vasculopathy cases (Rock et al. Stroke 2016;47(4):984\u2010991), compared to 30% for ACA and PCA. Posterior circulation involvement (basilar and PCA) occurs less frequently. \n\nOption A (ACA) is less commonly affected because the ACA branches lie dorsal to basal exudates. Option B (PCA) and D (basilar artery) are relatively spared; the basilar is deep but often shielded by the pons and arachnoid granulations. The MCA\u2019s lateral position at the sylvian fissure and its perforators makes it most susceptible to tuberculous vasculitis.","conceptual_foundation":"TB vasculopathy is classified under ICD\u201011 1B21.0 (tuberculous meningitis). The host immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the subarachnoid space leads to thick gelatinous exudates at the base of the brain. Historical classification recognized tubercular arteritis as a distinct entity in the 19th century; modern neuroimaging defines vasculopathy by vessel narrowing on angiography. Differential includes syphilitic vasculitis, cryptococcal vasculitis, and systemic vasculitides.","pathophysiology":"Normal leptomeningeal vessels are surrounded by CSF and arachnoid trabeculae. In TB meningitis, mycobacterial antigens provoke a granulomatous inflammatory response with epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells, leading to perivascular inflammation. This causes intimal proliferation, medial necrosis, and luminal narrowing. The MCA\u2019s M1 segment and lenticulostriate branches are embedded in the basal cisterns, making them prime targets. Reduced perfusion results in watershed infarcts in the MCA territory.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with subacute headache, fever, meningismus, and evolving focal deficits. Neurological sequelae include stroke syndromes\u2014hemiparesis, aphasia\u2014most often in the MCA territory. Infarcts occur in 15\u201340% of TB meningitis cases, predominantly MCA distribution.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with contrast reveals basal meningeal enhancement. MRA/CTA shows vessel narrowing in MCA segments. Conventional angiography remains gold standard, detecting beading and stenosis. Sensitivity of MRA for MCA involvement is ~85%; specificity ~90%. Early angiographic evaluation is advised in patients with focal deficits.","management_principles":"Standard anti\u2010tubercular therapy (HRZE for 2 months, HR for 7\u201310 months) plus adjunctive corticosteroids (dexamethasone tapered over 6\u20138 weeks) reduces mortality and vasculopathy. Aspirin (75\u2013150 mg daily) has been shown in RCTs (Misra et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2018;89(4):415\u2010421) to reduce stroke risk by 50%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial MRI/MRA at 4\u20136 weeks to assess vessel caliber. Neurological exam weekly during acute therapy, then monthly. Continued aspirin for at least 3 months in patients with documented vasculopathy.","clinical_pearls":"1. TB meningitis exudates localize to basal cisterns\u2014MCA branches are at greatest risk. 2. Up to 40% develop MCA territory infarcts. 3. Adjunctive aspirin halves stroke incidence. 4. Early angiography informs prognosis. 5. Steroids reduce inflammatory vasculitis.","references":"1. Rock RB, et al. Stroke. 2016;47(4):984\u2010991. doi:10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.011872 2.
