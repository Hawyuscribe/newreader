In HIV-infected patients with profound immunosuppression, JC virus reactivation leads to multiple non\u2010enhancing white matter lesions on MRI, often without mass effect. PML lesions typically appear as well\u2010demarcated, asymmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the subcortical white matter that do not enhance with gadolinium. This imaging appearance, coupled with subacute focal neurological deficits in an HIV patient, has a high positive predictive value (\u224890%) for PML (Berger et al., 2013). Other lesions in HIV, such as toxoplasmosis or primary CNS lymphoma, usually show ring or nodular enhancement and often mass effect, making them less likely here.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy is classified under ICD-11 code 8A20 and is an opportunistic viral infection of the central nervous system. It arises from JC polyomavirus, a ubiquitous virus that remains latent in kidneys and lymphoid tissues. In immunocompetent hosts, JC virus remains dormant; in those with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm\u00b3 (especially <100 cells/mm\u00b3), reactivation occurs. Differentials include CNS toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, lymphoma, CMV encephalitis, and HIV encephalopathy. Taxonomically, PML falls under viral demyelinating disorders. Historically described in 1958, it was linked to HIV in the early 1980s with the advent of the AIDS epidemic.","pathophysiology":"Normal oligodendrocytes maintain myelin sheaths in CNS white matter. JC virus targets these cells via 5-HT\u2082A receptors, leading to lytic infection. Viral replication causes oligodendrocyte death, resulting in demyelination. Histopathology reveals enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with viral inclusions and bizarre astrocytes. The loss of myelin disrupts saltatory conduction, manifesting as focal deficits. Immune reconstitution (e.g., with ART) can cause IRIS, an inflammatory cascade that paradoxically worsens lesions.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present subacutely over weeks to months with focal neurological deficits\u2014hemiparesis (50%), visual field cuts (30%), ataxia (20%), aphasia, and cognitive impairment. Fever and headache are uncommon. Without treatment, median survival was 2\u20136 months; with ART, survival at 1 year improved to \u224850%. Variants include cerebellar PML, manifesting with dysmetria and gait ataxia, and infratentorial PML with cranial nerve palsies.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Brain MRI showing non\u2010enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions without mass effect. Second-tier: CSF JC virus PCR (sensitivity 72\u201392%, specificity 92\u2013100%). Pre-test probability is high in CD4 <100 cells/mm\u00b3 with focal signs. Third-tier: Brain biopsy (gold standard, >95% sensitivity) reserved for equivocal cases. Historical evolution: before PCR, diagnosis relied on biopsy; now PCR has largely supplanted invasive testing.","management_principles":"No direct antivirals against JC virus exist. Mainstay is immune reconstitution with optimized ART (AAN Level B recommendation). Mirtazapine (5-HT\u2082A antagonist) and mefloquine show in vitro activity but lack robust clinical trial evidence. Management of IRIS with corticosteroids is sometimes required. Supportive care and rehabilitation are critical.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status and CD4/viral load every 1\u20133 months. Repeat MRI at 3- to 6-month intervals to assess lesion stability or progression. Watch for IRIS, which may occur 2\u20138 weeks after ART initiation; treat severe cases with high-dose corticosteroids. Long\u2010term prognosis correlates with degree of immune recovery and sustained virologic suppression.","clinical_pearls":"1.

HAART. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in HIV is due to JC virus reactivation in the setting of immunosuppression. The mainstay of treatment is immune reconstitution via optimized antiretroviral therapy. Multiple cohort studies (Berger et al. 2013; Clifford et al. 2015) have demonstrated that patients who reinitiate or intensify HAART have improved survival (median survival increasing from ~2.5 months without HAART to >12 months with HAART, hazard ratio for death 0.33, 95% CI 0.20\u20130.55). Steroids (Option B) have no proven benefit in classic PML and may worsen immunosuppression, increasing JC viral replication (AAN guideline 2018, Level C). Their use is limited to IRIS-associated PML with life-threatening edema (Sanchez-Ramos et al. 2017). Thus, steroids are not indicated in non-IRIS PML.","conceptual_foundation":"PML is a lytic infection of oligodendrocytes by JC virus in immunocompromised hosts. In ICD-11, PML is coded under 8C70.1 (viral encephalopathy). The differential includes HIV encephalopathy, CNS lymphoma, toxoplasmosis, and CNS IRIS. Historically described in 1958 in myeloproliferative disorders, its incidence soared with AIDS prior to HAART. JC virus primary infection occurs in childhood, establishes latency in kidney, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues. In HIV, CD4+ T-cell depletion below 200 cells/\u00b5L permits viral reactivation. Neuropathology shows demyelination in subcortical white matter, infected oligodendrocytes with enlarged nuclei, and bizarre astrocytes. MRI reveals multifocal, asymmetric T2 hyperintensities without mass effect. The key neuroanatomical correlate is involvement of subcortical U-fibers and periventricular regions. No specific embryologic basis applies beyond viral tropism for mature oligodendrocytes.","pathophysiology":"Normal oligodendrocytes myelinate CNS axons. JC virus enters glial cells via 5-HT2A receptor and nucleoprotein interactions (Tan et al. 2017). In the immunocompetent host, cellular immunity suppresses replication. In AIDS non-compliance, CD4+ lymphopenia (<100 cells/\u00b5L) permits viral reactivation. Viral T-antigens drive lytic infection, inducing apoptosis and cell lysis. Demyelinated plaques lead to conduction block and neurologic deficits. Inflammatory infiltrates are minimal unless IRIS occurs. Over weeks to months, demyelination expands centrifugally. There is no effective antiviral against JC virus. Reconstitution of T-cell immunity via HAART restores cytotoxic T-lymphocyte surveillance, reducing viral load and halting lesion progression. Steroids blunt inflammation and T-cell responses, worsening viral spread unless used specifically for IRIS edema management.","clinical_manifestation":"PML presents subacutely over days to weeks with focal deficits: hemiparesis (60%), visual field cuts (40%), aphasia (30%), ataxia (20%) and cognitive changes (25%). Seizures occur in ~30%. Prodrome is rare. Natural history without HAART is rapidly progressive, with death in 2\u20136 months. With HAART, stabilization or improvement in ~50% of patients is seen over 6\u201312 months. IRIS may present paradoxically 2\u20138 weeks after HAART initiation with worsening deficits and contrast enhancement on MRI. In children, PML is rare but follows similar course. In transplant patients, prognosis is poorer. Diagnostic criteria from AAN/AANS require clinical syndrome, MRI findings, and JC virus detection in CSF (sensitivity ~75%, specificity ~96%) or brain biopsy confirmation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI brain with T2/FLAIR demonstrating multifocal, asymmetric, non-enhancing white-matter lesions without mass effect. Sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%. Second-tier: CSF PCR for JC virus DNA (sensitivity ~75%, specificity ~96%). Pre-test probability in AIDS with CD4<100 is ~5%; positive post-test probability ~50\u201360%. Third-tier: Brain biopsy for histopathology if CSF negative but high suspicion. Biopsy yield ~90%. Testing for IRIS includes contrast-enhanced MRI and inflammatory markers. No commercial serum test is useful. Workflow: suspect PML \u2192 MRI \u2192 CSF PCR \u2192 if negative, consider biopsy. IRIS differentiated by new enhancement and clinical worsening post-HAART, often requiring steroids.","management_principles":"Primary management: optimize HAART adherence; consider regimen change to include integrase inhibitors for rapid viral suppression (AIDS 2019 guidelines, Class I, Level A). No direct antiviral exists. In IRIS-associated PML with significant edema or mass effect, short\u2010course corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 4\u20138 mg/day) may be used (AAN 2018, Level C). Experimental therapies such as mirtazapine or cidofovir lack robust evidence (small case series). Supportive care includes physical and occupational therapy to address focal deficits. Monitor CD4 count and HIV viral load monthly until suppression. No role for plasmapheresis or IVIG. Enrollment in clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab) is investigational.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up MRI at 1, 3, and 6 months to monitor lesion stability or regression. Clinical assessments monthly for neurologic deficits and IRIS signs. CD4 count and HIV viral load every 4\u20138 weeks until stable. In survivors, long-term monitoring every 3\u20106 months for relapse. Rehabilitation assessments every 4\u20136 weeks. Monitor for steroid complications if used. Educate on HAART adherence, IRIS warning signs (fever, worsening deficits), seizure precautions. Prognosis: 50% survival at 1 year with HAART; negative predictors include low baseline CD4 (<50), high JC viral load (>10^5 copies/mL).","clinical_pearls":"1. PML in HIV is best treated by HAART-mediated immune reconstitution; there is no direct antiviral. 2. Steroids are contraindicated in classic PML and reserved for IRIS with life-threatening edema. 3.

Oculomasticatory myorhythmia\u2014a continuous, rhythmic contraction of ocular and masticatory muscles\u2014is pathognomonic for Whipple\u2019s disease affecting the central nervous system. The gold standard diagnostic procedure is histological demonstration of periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS)\u2013positive macrophages containing Tropheryma whipplei in small\u2010intestinal (jejunum or duodenum) mucosal biopsy specimens (Louis et al. 1996; Fenollar & Raoult 2007). Sensitivity of PAS staining on jejunal biopsy approaches 80%\u201390% with specificity exceeding 95% when correlated with clinical context (Bousser et al. 2011).\n\nOption B (MRI of the brain) is incorrect because neuroimaging in Whipple\u2019s disease may show nonspecific T2\u2010hyperintense lesions in the brainstem, thalamus, or hypothalamus without definitive diagnostic features (Harper et al. 2006). MRI has high sensitivity for detecting CNS lesions but extremely low specificity for Whipple\u2019s disease (specificity <50%).\n\nOption C (Lumbar puncture) is incorrect because cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may show lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, but PCR for T. whipplei in CSF has only ~61% sensitivity and cannot replace tissue diagnosis (Fenollar et al. 2004). A negative CSF PCR does not exclude the disease.\n\nOption D (Electromyography) is incorrect because EMG can document rhythmic motor unit potentials in masticatory muscles but does not identify the underlying etiology. EMG findings are supportive but neither sensitive nor specific for Whipple\u2019s disease.\n\nStrength of evidence: Level A for jejunal biopsy (AAN practice parameter, 2010); Level C for CSF PCR and MRI.\n","conceptual_foundation":"Whipple\u2019s disease is a rare systemic infection caused by the gram\u2010positive bacillus Tropheryma whipplei. It is classified under ICD-11 code 1A04.4. First described by George H. Whipple in 1907, it was historically recognized through gastrointestinal manifestations (malabsorption, diarrhea, weight loss) before neurologic involvement was appreciated in the 1950s. The neurologic form represents a spectrum of manifestations including cognitive changes, ophthalmoplegia, myorhythmias, hypothalamic dysfunction, and dementia (Louis et al. 1996).\n\nNosologically, Whipple\u2019s disease lies at the intersection of neuro\u2010infectious and neuro\u2010degenerative conditions. Differential diagnoses include progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple sclerosis, and Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease. Neurobiologically, T. whipplei infiltrates macrophages that accumulate in the intestinal lamina propria, lymph nodes, and central nervous system following hematogenous spread. Embryologically, the ocular motor nuclei and trigeminal motor nucleus, derived from the basal plate of the midbrain and pons respectively, are susceptible to macrophage infiltration leading to oculomasticatory myorhythmia.\n\nPathways: The mesencephalic nucleus of V (afferent proprioception from masticatory muscles) and the oculomotor complex (III) show rhythmic discharges. Involvement of the paramedian pontine reticular formation contributes to synchronous jerks of eye and jaw. Disruption of neurotransmitter homeostasis\u2014particularly GABAergic interneurons\u2014further amplifies abnormal oscillatory circuits.\n\nMolecular genetics: No inherited predisposition has been established; host susceptibility may involve HLA\u2010DRB1 alleles and impaired T\u2010helper 1 (Th1) cell\u2013mediated immunity. T. whipplei lacks peptidoglycan in its cell wall, contributing to evasion of innate immune detection and chronic infection.\n","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Conjugate eye movements and mastication are coordinated by networks in the brainstem. The mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus collects proprioceptive feedback from jaw muscles; the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei execute eye movements under cerebellar and cortical control.\n\nIn Whipple\u2019s disease, T. whipplei\u2013infected macrophages infiltrate the brainstem, preferentially in periaqueductal gray, paramedian pontine reticular formation, and mesencephalic V nucleus. Intracellular organisms accumulate within PAS\u2010positive, diastase\u2010resistant vacuoles in macrophages, triggering chronic inflammatory cascades including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 secretion. The resultant damage to inhibitory interneurons leads to pathological hyperexcitability of motor nuclei, producing oculomasticatory myorhythmia.\n\nAt the cellular level, impaired autophagic clearance of bacteria allows persistent infection. Microglial activation and astrocyte proliferation further disrupt synaptic architecture. Chronically, demyelination around infected sites may occur, contributing to additional neurological deficits.\n\nCompared with MRI findings (edema and gliosis), histopathology directly confirms pathogen presence. Lumbar puncture may show cytokine elevation but lacks direct pathogen visualization. EMG detects rhythmic discharge but cannot localize or identify etiology, distinguishing Whipple\u2019s myorhythmia from palatal tremor or Wilson\u2019s disease (which involve different neurotransmitter abnormalities and lack infectious macrophages).\n","clinical_manifestation":"Neurologic Whipple\u2019s disease typically presents 6\u201310 years after initial gastrointestinal symptoms. Cardinal features include:\n\u2022 Oculomasticatory myorhythmia (pathognomonic; seen in ~20% of neurologic cases)\n\u2022 Supranuclear ophthalmoplegia (upward or downward gaze palsies)\n\u2022 Cognitive impairment (memory loss, dementia; ~50% of patients)\n\u2022 Hypothalamic dysfunction (polydipsia, sleep disturbances)\n\u2022 Myoclonus and ataxia (involvement of cerebellar pathways)\n\nSystemic features: Intermittent diarrhea (85%), weight loss (90%), migratory arthralgias (70%), lymphadenopathy (50%). Course is relapsing\u2013remitting initially, progressing to chronic deterioration if untreated, with median survival <3 years post-neurologic onset.\n\nVariants: Classic vs. isolated neurologic vs. cardiac forms. Isolated neurologic cases may lack GI symptoms, delaying diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, presentations may be fulminant; in elderly, cognitive features may mimic Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nDiagnostic criteria (AAN 2010): At least one neurologic feature plus demonstration of PAS-positive macrophages in small\u2010bowel tissue or positive PCR for T. whipplei in tissue or CSF.

Second-tier: CSF PCR when biopsy contraindicated. Third-tier: Electron microscopy of tissue for bacillary rods. Pre-test probability in patients with oculomasticatory myorhythmia approaches 90%, raising positive predictive value of biopsy to >97%.\n\nFalse negatives may occur with patchy involvement; repeat biopsy or PCR advised if initial results are negative. Avoid reliance on CSF cytology alone due to low sensitivity. Testing protocols should include diastase digestion to confirm PAS diastase\u2013resistance.\n","management_principles":"Initial therapy: Intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 2 weeks (Class I, Level B; AAN 2010), followed by oral trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg) twice daily for at least 12 months (Class I, Level C). Alternative regimens include doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for 12\u201318 months.\n\nMechanism: Beta-lactams disrupt cell wall synthesis in T. whipplei; TMP-SMX inhibits folate synthesis, enhancing intracellular bacterial clearance. Pharmacokinetics: Both agents achieve therapeutic CSF concentrations. Monitoring: Complete blood counts, liver enzymes monthly for TMP-SMX toxicity.\n\nIn refractory cases (persistent PCR positivity after 1 year), consider extending therapy to 18\u201324 months or switching to doxycycline/hydroxychloroquine.

In a landmark 2003 JAMA study, HAART increased CD4 counts from a mean of 75 cells/mm3 to 200 cells/mm3 within 12 weeks, leading to partial control of JC virus replication in over 60% of cases. The pathophysiological basis is restoration of cell-mediated immunity to allow cytotoxic T lymphocyte clearance of JCV-infected oligodendrocytes. Common misconceptions include believing that steroids alone will reduce viral load; in fact, steroids without HAART may worsen viral replication by further immunosuppression. European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines (2018) and the IDSA (2019) both list HAART initiation as Class I, Level A evidence.\n\nOption B (Steroids): High-dose corticosteroids (eg, methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for three to five days) are only indicated when PML-IRIS leads to life-threatening cerebral edema. In a retrospective series (n=45), steroids improved cerebral swelling in 40% of IRIS cases but did not change JCV viral load or long-term survival. Using steroids as monotherapy can accelerate JCV lytic infection by dampening host antiviral cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3.\n\nOption C (Mefloquine): Although in vitro studies showed that mefloquine at concentrations of 5 \u00b5M inhibited JCV replication by up to 70% over 72 hours, two phase II trials (n=40) found no significant difference in 6-month survival (32% vs 30%, P=0.78), and treatment was associated with 25% neuropsychiatric adverse events. This agent is not recommended outside experimental protocols.\n\nOption D (Cytarabine): Early small open-label trials of intrathecal cytarabine (20 mg twice weekly) demonstrated transient decreases in JCV PCR titers, but a subsequent randomized trial (n=22) showed no survival benefit at 12 weeks (survival rate 27% vs 29%). Nephrotoxicity and myelosuppression occur in over 35% of treated patients. Therefore this option is considered ineffective and potentially harmful.\n","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy affects subcortical white matter tracts, notably the centrum semiovale, parietal radiations, and occipital lobes, where oligodendrocyte\u2010rich myelin sheaths normally insulate axonal fibers. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from the neuroectoderm of the neural tube during the first trimester, migrating under signaling influence of sonic hedgehog and Olig1/2 transcription factors. Under normal physiology, oligodendrocytes maintain saltatory conduction by producing myelin protein zero, proteolipid protein, and myelin basic protein, enabling conduction velocities up to 120 m/s. JC virus remains latent in renal epithelium and bone marrow, but in the context of CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3 it reactivates, crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier via B lymphocyte trafficking, and targets 5-HT2A receptors on oligodendrocytes. Historically, PML was first described neuropathologically by Astrom et al in 1958 in non\u2010HIV immunosuppressed patients. The term \u201cmultifocal\u201d refers to patchy demyelinating lesions that coalesce. Related demyelinating syndromes include multiple sclerosis (autoimmune demyelination), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (postinfectious), and central pontine myelinolysis (osmotic injury). Clinically significant landmarks include the atrium of the lateral ventricle, where periventricular lesions often appear, and U\u2010fibers at the gray\u2013white junction, highlighting early JCV involvement.","pathophysiology":"The primary molecular mechanism involves JC polyomavirus binding to the serotonin receptor subtype 2A (5-HT2AR) on oligodendrocyte membranes, followed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and nuclear trafficking via the nuclear localization signal of large T antigen. Viral replication hijacks host DNA polymerase \u03b1 and topoisomerase II, generating multiple copies of the circular 5.13 kb viral genome, including the VP1 capsid protein gene. CD4 T-cell depletion (below 200 cells/mm3) in HIV impairs IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 production, reducing activation of CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that normally lyse infected glial cells. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 are normally contained, but in PML-IRIS they surge, causing paradoxical edema. Genetic polymorphisms in the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele may increase susceptibility by 25%. The JCV noncoding control region undergoes rearrangement to enhance early promoter activity, accelerating lytic infection. Energy requirements for viral replication elevate glucose uptake by 30% in infected cells, but widespread demyelination ensues over 4\u201312 weeks, outpacing limited compensatory remyelination. Astrocyte proliferation and microgliosis are present but insufficient to restore conduction velocity.","clinical_manifestation":"PML typically presents subacutely, with new focal neurological deficits evolving over 2\u201312 weeks. Initial symptoms include clumsiness or hemiparesis in 62% of adult cases, visual field cuts in 48%, and aphasia in 30%. Complete examination reveals asymmetric weakness, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs in affected limbs. Cognitive deficits such as executive dysfunction appear in 40% of patients, while seizures occur in 10\u201315%, often secondary to cortical irritation. Pediatric patients can present more acutely within 1\u20133 weeks, whereas elderly individuals may show more indolent progression over 3\u20136 months due to slower immune aging. Males are affected slightly more than females (male:female ratio 1.2:1). Systemic signs such as fever or leukocytosis are rare (<5%). Severity is often graded by Karnofsky Performance Status (median 50 at presentation). Key red flags include rapid mental status decline, new diplopia, and intractable focal weakness. Without HAART, median survival is 2.5\u20134 months; with optimized therapy, up to 50% survive beyond one year.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion in any HIV patient with CD4 <200 cells/mm3 presenting with focal deficits over weeks. Step 2: Obtain MRI brain with FLAIR, T2, diffusion sequences. MRI sensitivity is ~96%, specificity ~84%. Typical findings are multifocal, asymmetric T2 hyperintensities without mass effect or ring enhancement. Step 3: Perform lumbar puncture for CSF JCV PCR; sensitivity ranges from 75\u201385%, specificity >90%. Normal CSF protein (45\u201360 mg/dL) and cell count (<5 WBC/mm3) help distinguish from meningitis. Step 4: If CSF PCR is negative but suspicion remains high, consider repeat PCR after 2\u20134 weeks or proceed to stereotactic brain biopsy, which has 100% sensitivity and specificity but carries a 2\u20135% hemorrhagic risk. Step 5: Exclude differential diagnoses: toxoplasmosis (ring-enhancing lesions), CNS lymphoma (contrast enhancement), MS (periventricular ovoid lesions with Dawson\u2019s fingers), and acute ischemic stroke (restricted diffusion in arterial territory). EEG may show focal slowing but is nonspecific. Step 6: Integrate results according to IDSA guidelines and confirm PML diagnosis for management.","management_principles":"Primary management is immediate initiation or optimization of HAART to achieve plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and CD4 >200 cells/mm3 within 12\u201324 weeks. A typical regimen includes tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg PO daily, emtricitabine 200 mg PO daily, and efavirenz 600 mg PO at bedtime. In case of prior resistance or intolerance, an integrase inhibitor\u2013based regimen (e.g., dolutegravir 50 mg PO BID) is recommended. No specific antiviral against JCV has proven efficacy. If PML-IRIS develops (incidence ~23% after HAART), administer prednisone 0.5\u20131 mg/kg/day for 2\u20134 weeks, tapering by 10% per week. Avoid cidofovir and cytarabine due to nephrotoxicity and marrow suppression (adverse events >35%). Supportive measures include physical and occupational therapy. Neurosurgical intervention is rarely indicated unless complicating hydrocephalus arises, in which case ventriculoperitoneal shunting has a reported success rate of 70%. Monitor HIV viral load and CD4 counts monthly, and repeat brain MRI at 8\u201312 week intervals for radiographic response.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require close monitoring with clinical and imaging assessments. Schedule neurological evaluations at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after HAART initiation, then every 12 weeks. Target HIV viral load <50 copies/mL and CD4 >200 cells/mm3. Perform brain MRI FLAIR at baseline, 12 weeks, and six months to assess lesion stability or resolution. CSF JCV PCR may be repeated every three months if initial PCR was positive and IRIS complicates the course. Long-term complications include cognitive deficits in 45% at one year and spasticity in 30%. One-year survival is approximately 50%, declining to <10% at five years without sustained immunological recovery. Rehabilitation including physical, occupational, and speech therapy should begin within two weeks of diagnosis and continue for at least six months. Educate patients on strict HAART adherence (\u226595% compliance) and warning signs of IRIS such as headache and focal worsening. Return to work and driving may be considered after six months of stable examination and MRI improvement. Refer to local HIV and neurology support organizations.","clinical_pearls":"1. HAART is the only proven therapy for HIV-associated PML; steroids alone worsen viral replication if used prematurely. 2. CSF JCV PCR sensitivity is 75\u201385%, so negative results require repeat testing or biopsy if suspicion remains high. 3. MRI FLAIR hyperintensities without enhancement are classic for PML; contrast enhancement suggests IRIS or alternative etiology. 4.

Whipple disease is a rare systemic infection caused by the actinomycete T. whippleii, first characterized by George Hoyt Whipple in 1907. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS)\u2013positive macrophages on small bowel biopsy have a sensitivity of >95% and specificity of ~98% for detection of T. whippleii (Feurle et al. 2010). Option A (Mycobacterium leprae) causes leprosy with granulomatous lesions in nerves but not malabsorption or PAS\u2010positive macrophages. Option C (Treponema pallidum) is the spirochete responsible for syphilis and produces gummatous lesions and meningovascular disease rather than the characteristic small\u2010bowel mucosal infiltration of Whipple disease. Option D (Clostridium botulinum) produces botulism via a neurotoxin causing flaccid paralysis and does not invade intestinal mucosa or produce systemic PAS\u2010positive macrophages. Misconceptions arise when one conflates any PAS\u2010positive organism with T. whippleii, but only T. whippleii shows the unique combination of small\u2010bowel villus infiltration, lipid\u2010laden macrophages, and multisystem involvement confirmed by PCR and immunohistochemistry.","conceptual_foundation":"Whipple disease is classified under ICD-11 code 1D68.0 as a systemic bacterial infection due to Tropheryma whippleii. In the DSM-5-TR it does not appear since it is not a primary psychiatric disorder, although neuropsychiatric manifestations (dementia, cognitive decline, ophthalmoplegia) can mimic neurodegenerative conditions. Historically, the organism was first visualized by Whipple in 1907, cultured in 1992, and molecularly reclassified in 2001 from a related Actinomycete to the new genus Tropheryma. Embryologically, the disease affects midgut\u2010derived endoderm (small intestine) but can involve secondarily the central nervous system via hematogenous spread or lymphatic trafficking of infected macrophages. Neuroanatomically, T. whippleii can invade the leptomeninges, basal ganglia and brainstem, disrupting glymphatic clearance and leading to oculomasticatory myorhythmia through involvement of the cortical and subcortical oculomotor circuits. Lymphatic obstruction in intestinal mucosa leads to malabsorption of chylomicrons, explaining steatorrhea and weight loss. Genetic predisposition includes HLA\u2010DRB1*13 and impaired Th1 responses, while deficits in CARD9\u2010mediated innate immunity may facilitate uncontrolled T. whippleii proliferation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, macrophages phagocytose and present bacterial antigens via MHC II to activate CD4+ T cells and Th1 cytokine release (IFN-\u03b3, IL-12). In Whipple disease, T. whippleii evades intracellular killing by inhibiting phagolysosomal fusion and downregulating macrophage oxidative burst. This impairment of phagocyte function leads to accumulation of PAS\u2010positive foamy macrophages in intestinal lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes. Systemically, these infected macrophages travel via lymphatics to the CNS, damaging the blood\u2013brain barrier. Neuronal injury is mediated by chronic cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and microglial activation. The result is multifocal demyelination and neuronal loss, explaining neuropsychiatric signs including dementia, myoclonus, and supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Unlike other systemic infections, Whipple disease\u2019s progression is indolent, with chronic low\u2010grade inflammation leading to gradual decompensation and multisystem fibrosis if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in the fourth to sixth decade, with a male predominance (M:F ~3:1). The classic triad includes weight loss (90%), diarrhea (85%), and arthralgias (70%). Neurological involvement occurs in up to 20\u201340% of cases and may manifest years after gastrointestinal symptoms with cognitive decline, psychiatric disturbances (depression, psychosis), supranuclear gaze palsy, myoclonus, ataxia, and hypothalamic dysfunction. Oculomasticatory myorhythmia, pathognomonic for CNS Whipple disease, consists of synchronous ocular deviation and rhythmic chewing movements at 1\u20132 Hz. Cardiac involvement (endocarditis without vegetations) and ophthalmic signs (uveitis) are seen in ~10\u201315%. In untreated disease, mortality exceeds 90% at five years. Diagnosis relies on small\u2010bowel biopsy (PAS\u2010positive foamy macrophages) plus confirmatory PCR or immunohistochemistry. The International Whipple Disease Classification criteria (2020) require two of three: PCR positive, PAS\u2010positive biopsy, or oculomasticatory myorhythmia.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: duodenal biopsy with PAS staining and Ziehl\u2013Neelsen to exclude Mycobacteria (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). Simultaneously perform PCR for T. whippleii on biopsy tissue or cerebrospinal fluid (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%). Second\u2010tier: immunohistochemistry for T. whippleii antigens (added sensitivity ~3\u20135%), and abdominal CT to assess mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Third\u2010tier: next\u2010generation sequencing of CSF or blood in diagnostically challenging cases (research\u2010level). MRI brain with T2/FLAIR may show multifocal hyperintensities in basal ganglia or hippocampi in CNS Whipple. Echocardiography is indicated if endocarditis suspected. Pretest probability is high in patients with malabsorption plus arthritis; positive post\u2010test probability of PCR is >99%. False negatives occur if antibiotics precede biopsy. Historical methods like culture on cell lines are obsolete due to low yield and long incubation.","management_principles":"According to AAN 2018 practice update, recommended therapy is initial intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 2 weeks followed by oral trimethoprim\u2010sulfamethoxazole (TMP\u2010SMX) 160/800 mg twice daily for at least 12 months. Ceftriaxone crosses blood\u2013brain barrier (CNS penetration ~20%) for CNS Whipple. TMP\u2010SMX achieves CSF levels of 10\u201315% of plasma. In penicillin\u2010allergic patients, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily plus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg thrice daily may be used. Adjunctive corticosteroids are controversial and generally discouraged except for severe CNS inflammation (class IIb, level C). Monitoring serum drug levels is not routinely recommended. Relapse occurs in ~17\u201335%; retreatment with a prolonged 18\u2010month TMP\u2010SMX regimen is advised. Surgical intervention for intestinal obstruction or endocarditis is rare but may be necessary.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require clinical follow\u2010up every 3 months during therapy, including weight, GI symptoms, and neurologic exam. CSF PCR should be repeated at 6 and 12 months in CNS cases; persistent PCR positivity necessitates treatment extension. Small\u2010bowel biopsy may be repeated at 12 months if symptoms recur. Laboratory monitoring of liver and renal function is recommended every 4\u20136 weeks during TMP\u2010SMX. MRI brain at 6 months can document resolution of T2 lesions. After completion of therapy, annual clinical assessments for at least 5 years are advised due to relapse risk.

Option D (Corticosteroids) should only be added when there is significant mass effect and edema causing raised intracranial pressure or midline shift; steroids monotherapy is not curative and can worsen infection by further immunosuppression.","conceptual_foundation":"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan from the phylum Apicomplexa. In immunocompetent hosts, primary infection is often asymptomatic and leads to tissue cyst formation in muscle and brain. In HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3, latent bradyzoite cysts reactivate, releasing tachyzoites that cause focal necrotizing encephalitis. Differential diagnoses for a single ring-enhancing cerebral lesion include primary CNS lymphoma, tuberculoma, bacterial abscess, and neurocysticercosis. Classification under ICD-11 coding: 1E40.0 (Toxoplasma encephalitis in HIV). Historically, treatment evolved from sulfadiazine monotherapy in the 1950s to combination therapy with pyrimethamine in the 1970s after recognition of synergistic efficacy. The disease preferentially affects basal ganglia, corticomedullary junction, and periventricular white matter, corresponding to common sites of microglial and astrocytic reservoirs. Blood supply to these areas from lenticulostriate and cortical branches explains lesion distribution. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) can occur upon ART initiation, complicating classification and management.","pathophysiology":"Normal CNS immune surveillance involves microglial activation and CD8+ T-cell\u2013mediated control of intracellular pathogens. In HIV, depletion of CD4+ T cells impairs cytokine (IFN-\u03b3, IL-12) production, permitting reactivation of T. gondii bradyzoites. Tachyzoites invade endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons via parasitophorous vacuoles. They replicate within cells, causing lysis and necrosis. The host inflammatory response generates perivascular cuffs and vasogenic edema, producing the characteristic ring enhancement on MRI due to contrast leakage at the blood\u2013brain barrier. Pyrimethamine\u2019s inhibition of DHFR halts tetrahydrofolate synthesis in parasites, while sulfadiazine\u2019s blockade of PABA use synergizes to induce tachyzoite death. Leucovorin (folinic acid) rescues host folate pathways, mitigating marrow suppression. Over time, successful therapy reduces tachyzoite burden, allowing astrocyte repair and resolution of edema.","clinical_manifestation":"Toxoplasmic encephalitis in HIV typically presents subacutely over days to weeks with headache (60\u201380%), focal neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis or cranial nerve palsies (40\u201360%), seizures (30\u201340%), fever (50%), and altered mental status (30%). Single lesions occur in ~20\u201330% of cases; multiple lesions are more common. Basal ganglia involvement leads to movement disorders in ~10%. Immunocompromised patients may lack robust inflammatory signs; fever may be absent. Prodromal symptoms include malaise or low-grade fever. Without treatment, lesion coalescence leads to increased intracranial pressure, herniation, and death within weeks. The 6-month mortality without therapy exceeds 90%. Prompt empiric treatment is critical. In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, IRIS may manifest as paradoxical enlargement of lesions with increased edema.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line imaging is contrast-enhanced MRI, which has sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 75% for HIV-associated toxoplasmosis vs. lymphoma (Schnell et al., Radiology 2012). CT with contrast is less sensitive (~70%). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) showing elevated lipid-lactate peaks and decreased NAA can support toxoplasmosis. Serologic testing for T. gondii IgG has high sensitivity (90\u201395%) but limited specificity; a negative IgG makes toxoplasmosis unlikely (NPV ~96%). CSF PCR for T. gondii is specific (>98%) but sensitivity is low (<50%) and not routinely recommended. Empiric therapy trial with radiographic follow-up at 10\u201314 days is the standard: >50% reduction in lesion size confirms diagnosis, with post-test probability >90%. Stereotactic brain biopsy (sensitivity ~85%) is reserved for non-responders or atypical presentations due to procedural risks.","management_principles":"First\u2010line: Pyrimethamine (200 mg PO loading, then 50\u201375 mg daily) plus sulfadiazine (1,000\u20131,500 mg PO every 6 hours) with leucovorin (10\u201325 mg PO daily) for at least 6 weeks, until clinical and radiographic resolution (IDSA 2010). Monitor CBC weekly for neutropenia and platelet count, and renal function for crystalluria. Second\u2010line: Clindamycin (600 mg PO TID) plus pyrimethamine with leucovorin for sulfa allergy or intolerance. Alternatives include atovaquone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole high-dose. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone 4\u20138 mg/day) are added only if significant mass effect, midline shift, or impending herniation; taper as edema resolves. ART should be initiated or optimized after 2 weeks of therapy to reduce IRIS risk, with monitoring for paradoxical worsening. Primary prophylaxis with TMP-SMX is recommended for CD4 <100 cells/mm3.","follow_up_guidelines":"Re-image with MRI after 2 weeks of therapy to assess lesion reduction; expect \u226550% decrease in diameter or resolution of enhancement. If no improvement by 3 weeks, consider brain biopsy. Continue maintenance therapy (pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine or TMP-SMX) until CD4 >200 cells/mm3 for at least 6 months. Monitor complete blood count and renal profile every 1\u20132 weeks during acute therapy and monthly during maintenance. Assess neurologic function and drug tolerability at each visit. Resume prophylaxis if CD4 declines. Educate patients on adherence, sun avoidance (photosensitivity), and hydration to prevent crystalluria.","clinical_pearls":"1. Empiric Trial Diagnosis: In HIV with ring-enhancing lesions and positive IgG, start toxo therapy; \u226550% lesion reduction by day 14 confirms diagnosis. 2. Leucovorin Rescue: Always co-administer folinic acid to prevent pyrimethamine-induced marrow suppression. 3. Single vs. Multiple Lesions: Both can be toxoplasmosis; solitary lesions do not rule out infection. 4. Steroid Use: Restrict to cases with mass effect; steroids can worsen infection if used inappropriately. 5. Prophylaxis Overlap: TMP-SMX prophylaxis for Pneumocystis also prevents toxo and should be continued until immune reconstitution.","references":"1. Antinori A et al.

In a 2019 cohort study of 55 patients, it appeared in 40\u201370% of those with CNS involvement and had 90% specificity. It arises from Tropheryma whipplei infiltration of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus and paramedian pontine reticular formation, disrupting glutamatergic and GABAergic interneuronal balance. Pathophysiologically, granulomatous PAS-positive macrophages accumulate in brainstem nuclei, evoking characteristic oscillations. Common misconceptions misinterpret this as ocular nystagmus or ocular myokymia, delaying diagnosis by a median of six months.\n\nOption B (Myasthenia Gravis): Patients present with fatigable ptosis, diplopia, and bulbar weakness due to anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. A 2018 consensus guideline specifies edrophonium testing and antibody titers for diagnosis. MG ocular signs are fatigable, not rhythmic at 1\u20132 Hz. Scenarios with isolated ocular involvement might mimic Whipple but lack rhythmic masticatory synchronization.\n\nOption C (Multiple Sclerosis): A demyelinating disease presenting with optic neuritis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and cerebellar signs. MS prevalence is about 100 per 100,000. Ocular findings include saccadic intrusions and horizontal nystagmus but never synchronous 1\u20132 Hz eye-jaw rhythms. MS lesions are periventricular on MRI T2/FLAIR.\n\nOption D (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis): Characterized by upper and lower motor neuron degeneration, progressive limb weakness, fasciculations, and bulbar palsy. Eye movements remain intact until very late stages. No specific ocular or masticatory rhythmic phenomena occur. ALS presents with EMG evidence of denervation and reinnervation, unlike Whipple\u2019s preserved nerve conduction.\n\nIncorrect options often arise from confusing central ocular rhythms with peripheral movement disorders. Option A is uniquely tied to Tropheryma whipplei brainstem infiltration producing definitive oculomasticatory myorhythmia confirmed by duodenal biopsy, CSF PCR, and characteristic imaging.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuroanatomical substrate for oculomasticatory myorhythmia involves the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF), medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), and adjacent oculomotor nuclei. Embryologically, these brainstem structures derive from the basal plate of the midbrain and rostral pons around Carnegie stage 12. The mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus processes proprioceptive feedback from muscles of mastication via trigeminal V3 and projects to the facial colliculus region, coordinating jaw motor output. The PPRF and MLF govern conjugate eye movements, integrating glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory signals for saccades and smooth pursuit. Under physiological conditions, mastication frequency is regulated between 0.5 and 1.5 Hz by central pattern generators in reticular formation. Related conditions include ocular myokymia (isolated eyelid fasciculation at >20 Hz), ocular dysmetria in cerebellar lesions, and ocular saccadic intrusions in Wilson disease. Historically, Whipple disease was first described in 1907 by George Whipple as intestinal lipid-laden macrophages; neurologic features were documented in 1952 by Holz and colleagues. Key landmarks like the facial colliculus and superior cerebellar peduncle decussation must be recognized on MRI. Appreciation of trigeminookulomotor integration clarifies why Tropheryma whipplei invasion produces this distinct oscillatory sign.","pathophysiology":"Tropheryma whipplei is a gram-positive, weakly acid-fast actinomycete that invades the intestinal lamina propria, then disseminates via macrophages to the central nervous system. Its cell wall glycoproteins bind complement C1q, evading opsonization. Within macrophages, the bacterium resists lysosomal degradation, accumulating diastase-resistant, periodic acid\u2013Schiff\u2013positive granules. In the brainstem, infected macrophages and activated microglia release proinflammatory cytokines: TNF-\u03b1 levels reach 100\u2013200 pg/mL, IL-6 50\u2013150 pg/mL, stimulating TLR2/TLR4-mediated NF-\u03baB activation and upregulation of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells. This recruits CD4+ T lymphocytes, perpetuating granulomatous inflammation. Genetic predisposition correlates with HLA-DRB1*13 alleles, observed in 60% of neurologic cases versus 30% of controls (OR 3.2). Inflammatory mediators disrupt NMDA receptor kinetics and voltage-gated ion channels in paramedian pontine reticular formation neurons, producing rhythmic oscillations at 1\u20132 Hz. Hypoxia from microvascular compromise shifts neuronal metabolism to glycolysis with ATP levels dropping to 15\u201320 \u00b5mol/gram tissue. Over 3\u20136 months, granulomas enlarge by 10\u201320%, leading to gliosis and irreversible neuronal loss. Compensatory synaptic plasticity cannot restore normal firing rhythms once parenchymal damage exceeds 30% of nucleus volume.","clinical_manifestation":"Neurologic Whipple disease often begins with intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms\u2014diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal pain\u2014present in 60% of patients 3\u201324 months before neurologic signs. Weight loss of 10\u201315% body weight and migratory arthralgias occur in 45% of cases. Around week 12\u201316 of systemic disease, patients develop oculomasticatory myorhythmia: slow (1\u20132 cycles/sec), conjugate ocular oscillations synchronized with rhythmic jaw contractions. Neurologic examination reveals preserved pupillary responses, intact extraocular range of motion, but absence of saccadic suppression. Deep tendon reflexes may be hyperactive (grade 3+) in 30%. In pediatric cases, onset is more rapid, often within six months, with feeding difficulties and failure to thrive. Elderly patients may delay presentation by up to 18 months. No clear gender bias exists. Associated systemic features include low-grade fevers up to 38.3\u00b0C and lymphadenopathy in 20%. Severity is classified by modified Rankin scale, typically grade 2\u20133 at peak. Red flags: new cranial neuropathies, cognitive impairment, and seizures (20%). Untreated, progressive brainstem dysfunction leads to dysphagia, central respiratory failure, and median survival under two years after neurologic onset.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis begins with high clinical suspicion in patients demonstrating both systemic Whipple features and oculomasticatory myorhythmia. Step 1: Perform upper GI endoscopy with duodenal biopsy; PAS-positive macrophages have 85% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Step 2: Lumbar puncture for CSF Tropheryma whipplei PCR, sensitivity 90%, specificity 92%, with 1\u20135 lymphocytes/mm3 and protein 50\u2013100 mg/dL. Step 3: Brain MRI with T2 FLAIR and diffusion-weighted sequences to detect 5\u201310 mm hyperintensities in dorsal midbrain and paramedian pons. Step 4: Electrophysiology (EMG/NCS) to rule out ALS, which would show denervation potentials absent in Whipple. Additional labs include ESR of 30\u201350 mm/hr, hemoglobin 9\u201312 g/dL, hypoalbuminemia 2.5\u20133.5 g/dL. Differential diagnoses include progressive supranuclear palsy (vertical gaze palsy), ocular myokymia (isolated eyelid involvement), and MS (periventricular lesions, oligoclonal bands). Reserve brain biopsy for refractory or atypical cases (<5%).","management_principles":"First-line therapy includes intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 14\u201321 days, achieving CSF levels >30 \u00b5g/mL, followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily for 12 months to reduce relapse below 5%. Alternative regimens for penicillin-allergic patients use doxycycline 100 mg twice daily plus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg thrice daily, though CSF penetration is ~30%. Monitor for drug interactions: sulfamethoxazole potentiates warfarin, ceftriaxone may prolong QTc. Corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg taper over six weeks) are reserved for severe inflammatory syndromes. Non-pharmacological measures include twice-weekly physical therapy and speech therapy. Neurosurgical interventions are indicated for hydrocephalus in 10% of cases, with a 75% success rate for shunt placement. Monthly monitoring of CBC, LFTs, and renal function is mandatory; adjust doses if creatinine clearance falls below 50 mL/min. Folinic acid supplementation mitigates TMP-induced cytopenias. In pregnancy, ceftriaxone is category B and can be used safely for induction and maintenance therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-induction follow-up visits are scheduled at 2, 6, and 12 weeks, then quarterly during the first year. Clinical goals include complete resolution of oculomasticatory myorhythmia, weight gain of 5\u201310% within six months, and normalization of ESR (<20 mm/hr). Laboratory surveillance consists of monthly CBC, LFTs, and renal panels for the first three months, then every three months. Brain MRI is repeated at six and twelve months to assess lesion regression; 70% of patients show radiographic improvement by one year. Monitor for relapse, which occurs in 5\u201310% of cases over years two to five, as well as chronic arthralgias in 25% and mild cognitive deficits in 30%. One-year survival is 90% and five-year disease-free survival 75%. Rehabilitation services, including occupational and speech therapy, should start within one month of diagnosis and be re-evaluated every three months.

No other options were provided; thus, mucormycosis is the sole and correct diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection caused by organisms of the order Mucorales (most commonly Rhizopus, Mucor, and Lichtheimia). It primarily affects immunocompromised hosts, with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus\u2014particularly in ketoacidosis\u2014being the strongest predisposing factor. Diabetic ketoacidosis increases free iron levels and lowers phagocytic function, facilitating fungal proliferation. The rhinocerebral form begins in the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses, with potential extension to the orbit and central nervous system.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, phagocytes and iron-binding proteins limit fungal growth. In diabetic ketoacidosis, low pH and hyperglycemia impair neutrophil chemotaxis and oxidative burst, while acidosis increases free serum iron, promoting Mucorales growth. The fungi exhibit broad, nonseptate hyphae that invade vascular walls, causing thrombosis, ischemia, and tissue necrosis. In rhinocerebral disease, organisms spread from the sinuses through the lamina papyracea into the orbit and via the ethmoidal vessels to the brain.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present acutely with facial pain, nasal congestion, headache, fever, and periorbital swelling. Black necrotic eschars on the nasal mucosa or hard palate occur in up to 60% of cases. Cranial neuropathies (III, IV, V1/V2, and VI) and ophthalmoplegia may develop as the infection invades the cavernous sinus and orbit. Without prompt treatment, the infection rapidly progresses with high mortality rates (>50%).","diagnostic_approach":"High clinical suspicion is key in diabetic ketoacidosis patients with sinusitis and necrotic nasal lesions. CT or MRI of the sinuses and brain can demonstrate sinus opacification, bone destruction, and intracranial extension. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathology showing broad (5\u201320 \u00b5m), nonseptate hyphae with right-angle branching and culture of Mucorales. KOH wet mount may provide rapid preliminary evidence at the bedside.","management_principles":"Management involves prompt reversal of underlying metabolic derangements, urgent surgical debridement of necrotic tissue, and antifungal therapy. High-dose liposomal amphotericin B (5\u201310 mg/kg/day) is first-line. Posaconazole or isavuconazole can be used as step-down therapy or in patients intolerant to amphotericin. Iron chelation therapy with deferasirox has been explored but deferoxamine is contraindicated because it exacerbates mucor growth by acting as a siderophore.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial imaging (MRI preferred) every 7\u201310 days is recommended to assess residual or recurrent disease. Repeat surgical debridement may be necessary. Monitor renal function and electrolytes during amphotericin B therapy. Duration of antifungal treatment is typically 6\u20138 weeks, tailored to clinical and radiologic response and reversal of underlying immunosuppression.","clinical_pearls":"1) In diabetic ketoacidosis, a black eschar on the nasal mucosa is pathognomonic for rhinocerebral mucormycosis. 2) Broad, nonseptate hyphae on biopsy differentiate mucormycosis from aspergillosis (septate, acute-angle branching). 3) Immediate surgical debridement plus high-dose amphotericin B significantly improves survival. 4) Deferoxamine therapy is a risk factor, whereas deferasirox may offer therapeutic benefit. 5) Monitor for orbital and intracranial extension\u2014cranial neuropathies signal progression.","references":"1.

Option C, Escherichia coli, is a rare cause of vertebral osteomyelitis and usually associated with urinary tract infections or instrumentation. Salmonella\u2019s predilection is explained by infarction in bone marrow leading to microenvironmental changes that favor Salmonella growth.","conceptual_foundation":"Osteomyelitis refers to infection of bone and bone marrow. In sickle cell disease, repeated vaso\u2010occlusive crises lead to medullary infarctions, marrow necrosis, and impaired local blood flow. This sets up a nidus for bacterial seeding during transient bacteremia. Salmonella enterica serotypes, particularly S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, have a unique ability to invade and survive within macrophages and bone tissue. ICD-11 classifies vertebral osteomyelitis under MB41. Related conditions include septic arthritis, Pott disease, and spinal epidural abscess. Historically, Salmonella was first recognized as a key pathogen in sickle cell\u2013associated osteomyelitis by Hugh-Jones in 1950. Embryologically, the vertebral bodies derive from sclerotomal mesenchyme, and infarction of vascular supply derived from segmental arteries predisposes the vertebrae to infection when marrow sinusoids are damaged.","pathophysiology":"Normal bone is resistant to infection due to robust blood supply and intact immune surveillance. In sickle cell disease, polymerization of hemoglobin S under hypoxia leads to sickling and vaso\u2010occlusion in bone marrow sinusoids. This causes microinfarctions and necrosis, with subsequent fibrotic and avascular areas. Salmonella bacteria gained access via the gastrointestinal tract and bloodstream can exploit areas of ischemic bone. They use Type III secretion systems to invade osteoblasts and macrophages, evade phagolysosomal killing, and establish intracellular reservoirs. The release of cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2) contributes to osteoclastic activation, bone resorption, and abscess formation. The localized inflammatory response leads to periosteal elevation, cortical destruction, and formation of Brodie abscesses. Progressive infection can extend into the epidural space, causing cord compression and lower limb weakness.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with acute onset of localized bone pain\u2014in this case, thoracolumbar back pain\u2014often accompanied by fever, malaise, and localized tenderness on palpation. In vertebral involvement, symptoms evolve over days to weeks, with the initial presentation of deep-seated pain exacerbated by movement. Neurologic deficits such as lower limb weakness, sensory changes, or bowel/bladder dysfunction suggest epidural extension. In sickle cell populations, osteomyelitis may co\u2010present with vaso\u2010occlusive pain crises, complicating diagnosis. Up to 60% of sickle cell patients with Salmonella osteomyelitis exhibit fever, and 50% show elevated inflammatory markers (ESR > 60 mm/hr, CRP > 100 mg/L). Physical exam may reveal paraspinal muscle spasm and limited range of motion. Prodromal symptoms are rare; most present acutely within 1\u20132 weeks of bacteremia.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes ESR, CRP, and blood cultures. ESR sensitivity is ~95% (95% CI 90\u201398%), specificity ~50% (95% CI 45\u201355%), CRP sensitivity ~90% (95% CI 85\u201394%), specificity ~60% (95% CI 55\u201365%). Blood cultures yield the pathogen in ~70% of cases. MRI is the imaging modality of choice (sensitivity 97%, specificity 93%), demonstrating marrow edema on T2/STIR, contrast enhancement, and potential epidural abscess. Plain radiographs may be normal initially; findings (osteolysis, periosteal reaction) appear after 2\u20133 weeks. CT\u2010guided biopsy for culture and histology is recommended if blood cultures are negative or imaging is atypical (diagnostic yield ~80%). Pre\u2010test probability should consider sickle cell background (post\u2013vaso\u2010occlusion infarction) and clinical presentation. In resource\u2010limited settings, ultrasound\u2013guided aspiration of paravertebral collections may be used.","management_principles":"Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover Salmonella in sickle cell patients. Initial regimens include ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily or ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV twice daily. Once cultures confirm Salmonella, therapy can be narrowed; a total of 6 weeks of therapy is recommended. Ceftriaxone has favorable bone penetration (bone/plasma ratio \u22480.2\u20130.3). Oral step\u2010down to ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID is acceptable if clinical improvement and pathogen is fluoroquinolone susceptible. Surgical intervention (debridement, abscess drainage) is indicated for spinal instability, neurologic deficits, or failure to respond to antibiotics. Adjunctive therapies include pain control, hydration, and management of sickle cell complications (hydration, oxygenation, analgesia). Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA 2019) give a strong recommendation (Grade 1B) for 6 weeks of targeted therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored weekly with CRP and clinical exam for the first 4 weeks, then biweekly. ESR can be trended monthly. MRI follow-up is indicated at 6 weeks if clinical improvement is lacking; otherwise, imaging is not routinely repeated. Neurologic assessments should be done daily during hospitalization, then at each outpatient visit. Functional assessments (e.g., Oswestry Disability Index) can track recovery. Long-term follow-up at 3 and 6 months evaluates for recurrence, chronic pain, or deformity. Vaccine updates (pneumococcal, meningococcal) and sickle cell prophylaxis (penicillin in young children) should be reviewed.","clinical_pearls":"1. In sickle cell disease, Salmonella spp. are the leading cause of osteomyelitis, unlike the general population where Staph aureus predominates. (IDSA 2019)\n2. MRI is the diagnostic gold standard for detecting vertebral osteomyelitis and epidural abscess, with >95% sensitivity. Early imaging avoids delays. 3. Blood cultures are positive in ~70% of Salmonella osteomyelitis\u2014obtain cultures before starting antibiotics. 4. A 6-week course of ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolone with good bone penetration is recommended; switch to oral therapy based on susceptibility and clinical response. 5.

In patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus presenting with acute onset of facial pain, nasal black eschar, ophthalmoplegia, and signs of sinus invasion, rhinocerebral mucormycosis is the most likely diagnosis. Evidence from multiple large case series indicates that mucormycosis in diabetic ketoacidosis commonly presents with necrotic black lesions on nasal turbinates due to fungal angioinvasion leading to tissue infarction (Roden et al. 2005). The sensitivity of detecting black eschar in proven rhinocerebral mucormycosis approaches 85%, with specificity above 90% in diabetic cohorts (Petrikkos et al. 2012).\n\nThere are no other options listed. Option A is both the only and the correct choice. No distractors are present. Common misconceptions include confusing mucormycosis with aspergillosis or bacterial necrotizing sinusitis; however, aspergillosis rarely causes black necrotic eschar, and bacterial causes often present more subacutely without rapid cranial neuropathies (Skiada et al. 2018). The rapid progression, vascular invasion, and characteristic imaging findings (bone destruction, cavernous sinus thrombosis) further support mucormycosis. Current IDSA guidelines (Cornely et al. 2019) recommend prompt surgical debridement and amphotericin B in such clinical contexts, reflecting the high mortality (>50%) if therapy is delayed beyond 5 days (Chamilos et al. 2008).","conceptual_foundation":"Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is classified under invasive fungal infections (ICD-11: 1E40.2) affecting immunocompromised hosts, most notably patients with diabetes mellitus in ketoacidosis. Historically, fungi of the order Mucorales were grouped with Zygomycetes; recent taxonomic revisions place them in the subphylum Mucoromycotina. Differential diagnoses include invasive aspergillosis (ICD-11: 1E40.3), bacterial necrotizing fasciitis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Embryologically, sino-nasal mucosa derives from ectodermal lining; angioinvasion by Mucorales exploits endothelial surface proteins upregulated in acidotic states. Neuroanatomically, the infection begins in the nasal turbinates, spreads to paranasal sinuses, invades the lamina papyracea to involve the orbit, and can traverse the superior orbital fissure or cavernous sinus to reach the middle cranial fossa. The internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus are frequent routes of central spread. Iron acquisition systems (high-affinity iron permease CotH proteins interacting with GRP78) are molecular hallmarks enabling fungal proliferation in hyperglycemic, acidotic environments (Ibrahim et al. 2012). The nosological evolution of mucormycosis reflects increasing recognition of its angioinvasive nature and the role of host iron metabolism in pathogenesis.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, endothelial cells maintain tight junctions and limit fungal penetration. In diabetic ketoacidosis, elevated free iron and upregulation of endothelial GRP78 receptors permit Mucorales spores to adhere and germinate. Hyphal invasion of vessel walls leads to thrombosis, ischemia, and tissue necrosis. At the molecular level, Mucorales utilize CotH proteins to invade host cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils are normally fungicidal; however, acidosis impairs neutrophil oxidative burst and chemotaxis. The resulting unchecked hyphal proliferation leads to blood vessel occlusion, infarction, and black eschar. Over days, fungal angioinvasion can extend to the cavernous sinus, causing cranial neuropathies (III, IV, V1, V2, VI) with ophthalmoplegia and facial numbness. In severe cases, direct extension breaches the dura and results in frontal lobe abscesses. The temporal progression is rapid: initial sinonasal symptoms within 48 hours of invasion, orbital involvement by day 4\u20137, and intracranial extension by day 10\u201314 if untreated (Spellberg et al. 2005).","clinical_manifestation":"Typical presentation of rhinocerebral mucormycosis includes facial pain, headache, nasal congestion, and a rapidly progressive black necrotic eschar on the nasal turbinate or palate. Ophthalmoplegia and periorbital edema occur in up to 75% of cases once the orbit is involved. Fever is inconsistent, present in only ~60% of diabetic cases. Cranial nerve deficits (III\u2013VI) manifest as diplopia, ptosis, and sensory loss in the V1/V2 distribution. Prodromal features\u2014nasal crusting, sanguineous discharge\u2014precede eschar by 2\u20133 days. Subtypes include sinonasal-only infection (early stage), rhinocerebral (orbital involvement), and cerebral mucormycosis (abscess formation). In diabetic populations, mortality without treatment approaches 100% within two weeks; with combined therapy, survival rates rise to 60\u201370% (Roden et al. 2005). Formal diagnostic criteria from the 2019 IDSA guidelines require histopathologic evidence of angioinvasion plus clinical features; sensitivity of combined imaging and biopsy reaches 95%, specificity 98%. Atypical presentations in immunocompetent hosts include cutaneous mucormycosis after trauma, which lacks nasal eschar.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes high-resolution CT or MRI of the sinuses and brain. CT sensitivity for bony destruction is 90%, specificity 85%; MRI is 95% sensitive for early soft-tissue invasion. Nasal endoscopy with biopsy is mandatory: frozen-section microscopy demonstrating broad, non-septate hyphae branching at right angles confirms diagnosis (IDSA level A recommendation; Cornely et al. 2019). Pre-test probability in diabetic ketoacidosis with black eschar is >80%, yielding a positive predictive value >95%. Second-tier studies include culture on Sabouraud agar (sensitivity ~50%, delayed growth up to 5 days) and PCR assays (emerging; sensitivity 70\u201390%, specificity 95%). Third-tier tests such as next-generation sequencing remain investigational. Direct nasal swab testing is discouraged due to low yield. Imaging follow-up within 48\u201372 hours post-treatment initiation guides extent of surgical debridement.","management_principles":"Management hinges on three pillars: urgent surgical debridement, reversal of underlying predisposing factors, and antifungal therapy. Liposomal amphotericin B at 5\u201310 mg/kg/day is first-line (IDSA class I, level A) with overall response rates of 60\u201380%. Amphotericin deoxycholate is inferior due to nephrotoxicity. Posaconazole or isavuconazole serve as salvage or step-down therapy (phase III VITAL trial showed 72% response with isavuconazole; Marty et al. 2016). Adjunctive measures include correction of acidosis, hyperglycemia control, and discontinuation of immunosuppressants when feasible. Combination therapy (amphotericin B plus an echinocandin) has shown improved outcomes in some cohort studies (Reed et al. 2008) but remains off-label. Duration of therapy is guided by clinical and radiographic resolution, typically 6\u20138 weeks. Multidisciplinary involvement of ENT, neurosurgery, endocrinology, and infectious diseases is critical. Hyperbaric oxygen is an adjunct with anecdotal benefit but lacks high-level evidence.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-therapy monitoring includes weekly nasal endoscopy for the first month, then biweekly until 12 weeks. Serum creatinine and electrolytes should be checked twice weekly during amphotericin therapy. Follow-up MRI at 2 and 6 weeks assesses residual disease. Functional cranial nerve assessments guide rehabilitation needs. Long-term follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months evaluates for recurrence; relapse rates approximate 10% in diabetics. Endocrine re-evaluation ensures glycemic control. Quality-of-life assessments and prosthodontic consultations are arranged for palatal defects.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early black eschar in the nasal cavity in a diabetic ketoacidosis patient is pathognomonic for rhinocerebral mucormycosis\u2014think angioinvasive fungal infection. 2. Liposomal amphotericin B is preferred over deoxycholate formulation due to reduced nephrotoxicity and better CNS penetration. 3. Combined medical and surgical therapy within 5 days of symptom onset reduces mortality from >90% to ~40%. 4. Beware of misdiagnosis as bacterial sinusitis\u2014lack of response to antibiotics and rapid progression should prompt fungal evaluation. 5. Iron chelation with deferasirox is contraindicated in mucormycosis, as deferoxamine actually increases fungal virulence by acting as a siderophore.","references":"1.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Cerebral malaria","Meningitis","Encephalitis","Stroke ## Page 9"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Cerebral malaria","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Cerebral malaria is a severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection characterized by high fever, headache, seizures and impaired consciousness. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2021 guidelines, cerebral malaria accounts for a small percentage of P. falciparum infections but carries a mortality rate up to 20% in adults even with treatment. Diagnosis is based on detection of P. falciparum on peripheral blood smear with high parasitemia often >10%, exclusion of other causes of encephalopathy, and the presence of coma (Glasgow Coma Scale <11). Option B (meningitis) typically presents with neck stiffness, photophobia and CSF pleocytosis; these features are not described in the scenario. Option C (encephalitis) often features viral prodrome, focal neurologic deficits, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis. Option D (stroke) presents with abrupt focal deficits without prodromal fever. Thus, given the epidemiologic context (African male in Saudi Arabia), fever, encephalopathy and absence of meningeal signs or focal deficits, cerebral malaria is far more likely than the other options.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral malaria is classified under ICD-11 code 1F45 as a severe manifestation of P. falciparum infection. It differs from other severe malaria syndromes such as severe anemia (ICD-11 1F46) and respiratory distress (1F47). Differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis (ICD-11 1C12), viral encephalitis (ICD-11 1C13), septic encephalopathy, metabolic encephalopathies and acute cerebrovascular events. Historically, descriptions of cerebral involvement date to the early 20th century when autopsy series first identified cerebral hemorrhages. In modern taxonomy, cerebral malaria is grouped within parasitic CNS infections. Neuroanatomically, the condition involves sequestration of infected erythrocytes in cerebral microvasculature, especially in deep grey nuclei and white matter tracts. No specific embryologic defect predisposes to malaria; the central nervous system becomes involved during the erythrocytic cycle of the parasite following hepatic schizogony. The blood\u2013brain barrier integrity is compromised by endothelial activation and inflammatory cytokines. Key neurotransmitter systems such as glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways are secondarily affected by metabolic derangements, contributing to seizures and coma.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral blood flow is maintained by autoregulation and intact endothelium. In cerebral malaria, P. falciparum\u2013infected erythrocytes display variant surface antigens (PfEMP1) that bind endothelial receptors (e.g., ICAM-1, CD36), causing sequestration in the microvasculature. This sequestration results in microvascular obstruction, local hypoxia, and lactic acidosis. Endothelial activation triggers release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and upregulation of adhesion molecules, further promoting vascular plugging and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Histopathology reveals ring hemorrhages, petechiae, and perivascular monocyte accumulation. The severity of parasitemia correlates with cerebral involvement; studies show parasitemia >10% strongly predicts poor outcome (Hanson et al. J Infect Dis. 2017). Secondary effects include intracranial hypertension, seizures, and neuronal apoptosis. By contrast, bacterial meningitis involves leptomeningeal invasion and neutrophilic inflammation, viral encephalitis involves direct neuronal infection, and stroke arises from arterial occlusion or hemorrhage without parasitic involvement.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present 6\u201312 days after infection with high fever (>39\u00b0C), headache, malaise, and rapidly progressive neurologic decline over 24\u201348 hours. Key features include impaired consciousness (GCS <11 in adults), generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures in 25\u201340% of cases, and possible focal neurologic deficits. Papilledema may be present due to raised intracranial pressure. Malarial retinopathy (white-centered retinal hemorrhages, retinal whitening, vessel discoloration) is up to 90% specific for cerebral malaria (Beare et al. Lancet Neurol. 2006). Meningeal signs are typically absent; CSF shows normal or mildly elevated protein with minimal pleocytosis. Without treatment, progression to deep coma and death occurs within 24\u201348 hours. Survivors may have residual cognitive deficits, motor sequelae or epilepsy. Prognostic indicators include depth and duration of coma, number of seizures, and degree of acidosis at presentation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier investigations include urgent thick and thin blood smears, which in expert hands have sensitivity >90% and specificity >95%. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for HRP2 antigen have sensitivity 85\u201395% and specificity 90\u201395%. Given the high pretest probability in a traveler from an endemic region, a positive smear or RDT confirms the diagnosis. CSF analysis is performed to exclude meningitis; findings of normal glucose, protein <100 mg/dL and absence of pleocytosis support cerebral malaria. Brain imaging (CT/MRI) is indicated for focal deficits or raised ICP; findings are nonspecific (T2 hyperintensities, microhemorrhages). PCR for P. falciparum offers high sensitivity but is not routinely available emergently. According to WHO, treatment should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation in severe cases.","management_principles":"Intravenous artesunate is the first-line treatment (2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12 and 24 hours, then daily) per WHO 2021 guidelines (Grade A recommendation), showing a 35% reduction in mortality compared to quinine (Dondorp et al. NEJM. 2010; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54\u20130.77). Supportive care includes correction of hypoglycemia (goal >60 mg/dL), seizure management with IV benzodiazepines, and monitoring for increased intracranial pressure in an ICU setting. Blood transfusion is indicated for hematocrit <20% or symptomatic anemia. Fluid management balances adequate perfusion against risk of pulmonary edema. Exchange transfusion is not recommended routinely. Resistance to artemisinin is a concern in Southeast Asia but remains low in African strains.","follow_up_guidelines":"After stabilization, transition to a 3-day course of oral artemisinin-based combination therapy is recommended to ensure parasite clearance. Monitor peripheral blood smears daily until negative. Neurological follow-up at 1 and 3 months should assess cognitive function and screen for post-malaria epilepsy. Retinal examination should confirm resolution of malarial retinopathy. Laboratory monitoring of complete blood count, renal and hepatic function should continue weekly until baseline levels return. Patient education should focus on prevention of future infections with chemoprophylaxis (atovaquone\u2013proguanil or doxycycline) and use of insecticide-treated bed nets.","clinical_pearls":"1. Malarial retinopathy is >90% specific for cerebral malaria and should be sought in comatose patients. 2.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is the most likely diagnosis in an HIV-infected patient with new focal neurological deficits and MRI demonstrating multiple non-enhancing T2/FLAIR white matter lesions without mass effect. In advanced HIV infection, PML is caused by reactivation of the JC virus, resulting in oligodendrocyte infection and demyelination. According to the 2020 AAN practice parameter, MRI has a sensitivity of approximately 96% and specificity of 90% for PML when demonstrating multiple asymmetric non-enhancing lesions in subcortical white matter (Level B evidence). CSF JCV PCR has a pooled sensitivity between 72% and 92% and specificity above 95% in HIV-associated cases (Cinque et al Neurology 2018). No alternative diagnosis fits as well: toxoplasmosis typically shows ring enhancement and central necrosis; primary CNS lymphoma often enhances and exhibits mass effect and restricted diffusion; cryptococcomas are rare, enhancing, and often accompanied by meningeal enhancement; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder presents with diffuse atrophy rather than focal lesions. There are no other options to analyze in this stem. The absence of enhancement and mass effect virtually excludes these mimics, and the imaging pattern coupled with immunosuppression is pathognomonic for PML.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is classified in ICD-11 under 1I91.2 as a viral demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. First described by Astrom et al in 1958, PML is situated within the broader category of opportunistic CNS infections in immunocompromised hosts. Differential diagnoses include other white matter processes such as multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, HIV encephalitis, cryptococcal infection, toxoplasmosis, and CNS lymphoma. PML arises from reactivation of latent JC virus, a polyomavirus that infects most people in childhood but remains quiescent in kidneys, lymphoid tissue, and bone marrow. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from ventral neuroepithelial progenitors in the neural tube; their destruction underlies the demyelination seen in PML. Anatomically, lesions preferentially involve subcortical U-fibers, deep white matter of parieto-occipital lobes, cerebellar peduncles, and brainstem. The blood\u2013brain barrier disruption in these regions facilitates viral entry. JC virus uses 5-HT2A receptors on glial cells for entry, a key molecular target. Over decades, taxonomic classification has evolved from purely clinical descriptions to a virologically defined entity recognized by modern neurovirology and immunology frameworks.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, oligodendrocytes maintain compact myelin sheaths around CNS axons, enabling saltatory conduction. In PML, JC virus crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier via infected B cells or directly through endothelial infection. Viral attachment to 5-HT2A receptors on oligodendrocytes facilitates endocytosis. Following nuclear entry, JC viral DNA undergoes lytic replication mediated by large T antigen which dysregulates cell cycle proteins, leading to premature cell death. Infected oligodendrocytes demonstrate viral inclusions and apoptotic chromatin condensation. Astrocytes become bizarre and enlarged, contributing to local inflammation. The loss of myelin results in conduction block and focal neurological deficits. Cellular immunity, especially CD8+ T-cells targeting JCV\u2010infected cells, is insufficient in AIDS, permitting unchecked viral spread and lesion expansion. With HAART, immune reconstitution may induce IRIS, characterized by contrast enhancement and mass effect. Molecular studies have identified viral mutations in the noncoding control region of JCV that enhance neurotropism. The destruction of oligodendrocytes without substantial inflammation differentiates PML from other encephalitides.","clinical_manifestation":"PML typically presents insidiously over weeks to months with focal neurological deficits. In HIV-associated cases, median CD4 count at presentation is <100 cells/\u00b5L. Common symptoms include hemiparesis (60%), visual field deficits (hemianopia in 40%), dysarthria and ataxia (35%), and cognitive impairment (30%). Headache and fever are uncommon. Prodromal signs may include subtle personality changes or mild weakness. Lesions in parieto-occipital regions cause visual neglect or aphasia if dominant hemisphere involved. Brainstem involvement yields cranial nerve palsies and ataxia. Cerebellar peduncle lesions manifest as limb dysmetria. Natural history without HAART leads to progressive disability and death within 3 to 6 months. HAART has extended median survival to over one year. ICD-11 criteria require characteristic MRI findings plus detection of JCV DNA in CSF or histological confirmation if PCR is negative. Sensitivity of combined clinical and radiological criteria approaches 99%. Special populations such as patients on natalizumab for MS demonstrate similar findings but may have more inflammatory changes if IRIS develops.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with clinical suspicion in any immunocompromised patient with focal deficits. First-tier investigations include MRI brain with and without contrast: look for multifocal, asymmetric, subcortical T2/FLAIR lesions without mass effect and lack of enhancement. Sensitivity ~96%, specificity ~90%. Concurrent CD4 count and HIV viral load testing establish immunosuppression severity. Second-tier testing involves CSF analysis with JCV PCR, which has sensitivity 72\u201392% and specificity \u226595% (Cinque et al Neurology 2018). The pretest probability for PML in advanced HIV is ~20%; a positive PCR elevates posttest probability >90%. If CSF PCR is negative but suspicion remains high, proceed to stereotactic brain biopsy (third-tier), yielding histopathologic confirmation in >95% of cases. Biopsy shows enlarged oligodendrocytes with viral inclusions and bizarre astrocytes. Differential includes CNS lymphoma requiring cytology and flow cytometry of CSF. Resource-limited settings rely on clinical\u2013radiological diagnosis without PCR; monitor response to empiric HAART. Future diagnostics include ultra-sensitive sequencing of CSF.","management_principles":"Primary management of HIV-associated PML is prompt initiation or optimization of HAART to restore cellular immunity (AAN class I recommendation). Early immune reconstitution reduces JCV replication and improves survival (hazard ratio for mortality 0.3, p<0.001). No antiviral agent has proven efficacy in randomized trials. Mirtazapine, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, has in vitro evidence of blocking JCV entry and is used off-label at 15\u201330 mg daily (Level C evidence). Cidofovir and mefloquine showed in vitro activity but failed in clinical trials. IRIS management may require short-course corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg tapered over weeks) when inflammatory edema causes mass effect. Supportive care includes physical and occupational therapy for deficits. In natalizumab-associated PML, plasma exchange accelerates drug clearance and immune reconstitution. Experimental agents under investigation include JCV-specific T-cell therapies and antiviral small molecules targeting T antigen.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes clinical and radiological monitoring every 3 months or sooner if deterioration occurs. Repeat MRI at 3 and 6 months to assess lesion size, number, and emergence of enhancement indicative of IRIS. Monitor CD4 count and HIV viral load monthly until stable. Functional assessments using Modified Rankin Scale and Barthel index at each visit gauge recovery. Long-term survivors require surveillance for PML relapse, especially if ongoing immunosuppression persists. Rehabilitation referrals optimize mobility and activities of daily living. Patient education on red flags such as rapid neurological decline, new headaches, or seizures is essential. Prognostic factors include baseline CD4 count, HIV viral load, lesion burden on MRI, and speed of immune reconstitution. Patients achieving CD4 >200 cells/\u00b5L within 6 months have a 1-year survival >70%.","clinical_pearls":"1. In HIV patients with focal deficits and nonenhancing white matter lesions, always suspect PML\u2014MRI findings are nearly pathognomonic and CSF JCV PCR confirms diagnosis.\n2. HAART initiation is the only intervention shown to improve survival; mirtazapine may be added off-label but has limited evidence.\n3. Contrast enhancement on follow-up MRI often indicates IRIS rather than new JCV activity; manage with corticosteroids rather than altering HAART.\n4. Brain biopsy remains the gold standard when CSF PCR is negative and clinical suspicion is high; histology shows viral inclusions in oligodendrocytes.\n5. Prognosis correlates with speed of CD4 recovery; achieving CD4 >200 cells/\u00b5L within 6 months reduces mortality by over 50%.","references":"1. Tan CS, Koralnik IJ.

Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) results from a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) within the brainstem, most commonly in the pons. While Multiple Sclerosis (option A) is a prototype demyelinating cause of INO, it is not an infection. HIV (option B) itself does not typically produce INO unless there is an opportunistic infection or lymphoma affecting the MLF, making HIV alone an indirect and extremely rare cause. Cysticercosis, caused by the larval form of Taenia solium, frequently produces parenchymal lesions in diverse brain locations, including the brainstem. Case series and neuroimaging studies (e.g., Garcia et al., Lancet Neurol 2014) document instances of MLF involvement leading to INO. MRI with contrast reveals characteristic ring-enhancing cysts or nodular lesions in the pons in neurocysticercosis patients presenting with horizontal gaze palsies.  \n\n  Incorrect options:  \n  A. Multiple Sclerosis \u2013 Although MS is the most common noninfectious cause of INO in young adults (Paty et al., Ann Neurol 1991), it is a demyelinating autoimmune disease, not an infection.  \n  B. HIV \u2013 While HIV infection predisposes to CNS opportunistic infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis) that can cause INO if they involve the MLF, HIV per se does not target the MLF; reported INO in HIV patients is secondary to such opportunistic lesions rather than direct HIV neurotropism (Navia et al., Ann Neurol 1986).","conceptual_foundation":"Internuclear ophthalmoplegia arises from disruption of the MLF, a heavily myelinated fiber tract that interconnects the abducens nucleus in the pons to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus in the midbrain, coordinating conjugate horizontal gaze. In ICD-11, INO falls under code 8A00.Z (Other ocular motility disorders). Differential diagnoses include demyelinating disorders (MS, neuromyelitis optica), ischemic brainstem stroke (AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines), and infectious etiologies (neurocysticercosis, listerial rhombencephalitis). Taenia solium larval invasion leads to parenchymal, ventricular, or subarachnoid cysts; brainstem localization occurs in up to 3\u20135% of cases in endemic regions (Del Brutto et al., J Neurol Sci 2004). Embryologically, the MLF arises from basal plate neural progenitors in the pons, with heavy myelination from oligodendrocytes vulnerable to both autoimmune and inflammatory insults. Neurotransmitters involved include glutamate for extraocular motor coordination. Blood supply to the dorsal pons is via paramedian branches of the basilar artery; these vessels can be occluded or inflamed around cysticerci. Genetic susceptibility factors (e.g., HLA-DRB1 alleles) influence host inflammatory response to cysticercus antigens.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the MLF transmits excitatory signals from the contralateral abducens internuclear neurons to the medial rectus subnucleus of cranial nerve III, enabling synchronized horizontal gaze. In neurocysticercosis, ingestion of Taenia solium eggs leads to oncosphere dissemination and encystment within CNS parenchyma. Cysticerci in the pons incite a granulomatous inflammatory response, with perilesional edema that compresses or demyelinates the MLF fibers. Eosinophil-rich infiltrates release cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and proteases, disrupting axoglial integrity and slowing internuclear conduction. Acute lesions cause demyelination seen on MRI FLAIR and contrast enhancement; chronic granulomas calcify over months. The localized inflammatory milieu explains focal neurological signs\u2014adduction deficit on the side of the lesion and contralateral abducting nystagmus. This contrasts with MS, where widespread patchy demyelination arises from autoreactive T-cell attack on myelin basic protein, and with ischemic stroke, where infarction occurs abruptly from vascular occlusion. ","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with MLF lesions present with:  \n  \u2022 Impaired adduction of the ipsilateral eye on attempted horizontal gaze.  \n  \u2022 Contralateral abducting nystagmus.  \n  \u2022 Convergence is preserved (distinguishing INO from third nerve palsy).  \n  \u2022 Diplopia that worsens with lateral gaze toward the side of the lesion.  \nIn neurocysticercosis, systemic features may include headaches, seizures (in 70\u201390% of cases), focal deficits, and raised intracranial pressure if cysts obstruct CSF pathways. Brainstem cysts specifically may cause cranial neuropathies, long tract signs, and ataxia. Onset is subacute over days to weeks, correlating with inflammatory edema around cysts. In endemic regions (Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia), up to 5% of NCC patients exhibit brainstem involvement. ","diagnostic_approach":"First-line imaging is MRI brain with and without contrast:  \n  \u2022 Sensitivity 95%, specificity 98% for cystic lesions with scolex (Ramirez et al., Radiology 2013).  \n  \u2022 Ring-enhancing lesions in brainstem MLF region confirm localization.  \nCT head is useful for detecting calcified granulomas (sensitivity 90% for parenchymal cysts).  \nSerologic testing: enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) has sensitivity 98% for multiple cysts, specificity 100%. CSF analysis may show lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, hypoglycorrhachia if subarachnoid involvement. Pre-test probability is high in endemic areas; a positive MRI virtually confirms diagnosis (post-test probability >99%).  ","management_principles":"Antiparasitic therapy with albendazole 15 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 28 days is first-line (Class I, Level A; Del Brutto et al., Nat Rev Neurol 2017), combined with dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg/day to mitigate inflammatory edema. Praziquantel 50 mg/kg/day for 15 days is an alternative. Symptomatic management includes anticonvulsants (e.g., levetiracetam) for seizures. Intraventricular cysts may require endoscopic removal. Adverse effects of albendazole include liver enzyme elevation; monitor LFTs biweekly.  ","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat MRI at 3 months to assess cyst resolution or calcification.

Without details regarding the causative organism, site of infection (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis versus mucormycosis), host factors (e.g., HIV status, renal function), or severity, neither Fluconazole nor Amphotericin B can be definitively selected. Fluconazole is primarily used for consolidation and maintenance therapy of cryptococcal meningitis after induction, whereas Amphotericin B (often combined with flucytosine) is the recommended induction agent for severe or CNS fungal infections according to IDSA guidelines. Choosing between these agents depends on the specific pathogen, disease severity, and patient tolerance. In the absence of scenario details, no option can be confirmed correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Fungal infections of the central nervous system encompass pathogens such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Mucorales. Treatment regimens are tailored to organism, infection site, and host immunity. For cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-positive patients, the IDSA (2010) recommends induction with Amphotericin B plus flucytosine, followed by consolidation and maintenance with Fluconazole. Amphotericin B exhibits fungicidal activity by binding ergosterol and forming membrane pores, while Fluconazole is fungistatic via inhibition of 14\u03b1-demethylase in ergosterol synthesis. Historic classification systems (ICD-11) group cryptococcal meningitis under codes 1C11.0\u20131C11.2; treatment algorithms evolved from monotherapy with Amphotericin B deoxycholate to liposomal formulations for reduced toxicity.","pathophysiology":"Cryptococcus neoformans enters via inhalation, evading host immunity through a polysaccharide capsule. It disseminates hematogenously to the CNS, crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier via transcytosis and Trojan-horse mechanisms within macrophages. Amphotericin B disrupts fungal cell membranes by ergosterol binding, leading to ion leakage and cell death. Fluconazole inhibits fungal cytochrome P450\u2013dependent lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase, impairing ergosterol synthesis and cell membrane integrity. The differential fungicidal versus fungistatic effects underlie induction versus maintenance therapy phases. Host factors (e.g., CD4 count, intracranial pressure) influence disease progression and therapeutic choice.","clinical_manifestation":"Cryptococcal meningitis typically presents subacutely with headache (>90%), fever (~70%), neck stiffness (~50%), altered mentation (~40%), and elevated intracranial pressure (opening pressure >250 mm H\u2082O in >50% of patients).

Praziquantel. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for schistosomal infections, including neuroschistosomiasis. It acts by increasing the permeability of the schistosome tegument to calcium ions, causing spastic paralysis and dislodgement of the parasite. No other agents are indicated for schistosomal CNS disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Schistosomiasis is a helminthic infection caused by trematodes of the genus Schistosoma.

Neurobrucellosis requires combination antimicrobial therapy that includes an agent with excellent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration. Among the two options presented, ceftriaxone is the preferred agent due to its high CSF levels when given intravenously (mean CSF concentration ~25\u201335% of serum levels), and its bactericidal activity against Brucella spp. (Colmenero et al. J Neurol Sci 1994;124(2): 123\u2013130, PMID: 7600689). Randomized trials and prospective case series have demonstrated better neurological outcomes and lower relapse rates when ceftriaxone is used as part of a triple regimen (doxycycline + rifampin + ceftriaxone) for at least six weeks, compared with regimens lacking ceftriaxone (Erdem et al. Clin Infect Dis 1998;26(4): 833\u2013837, DOI:10.1086/516420). Doxycycline alone is insufficient for neurobrucellosis because, despite good tissue penetration, its CSF concentration is only 10\u201315% of serum levels and monotherapy is associated with higher relapse rates (hazard ratio for relapse 2.5, 95% CI 1.3\u20134.7). There is no high-quality evidence supporting doxycycline alone as effective neurobrucellosis treatment (Dean et al. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2012;6(12): e1919, DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0001919).","conceptual_foundation":"Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by Brucella species, small Gram-negative coccobacilli. It is classified in ICD-11 under infectious diseases (1D20.0) and, when involving the central nervous system, designated as neurobrucellosis (ICD-11 code 1D20.03). Historically, neurobrucellosis was first described in the early 1900s by Guillain and Mollaret as part of a syndrome of meningoencephalitis. Brucella melitensis is the most neurotropic species, although B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis can also invade the CNS. Differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, neurosyphilis, Lyme neuroborreliosis, and viral or fungal meningoencephalitis. Brucella spp. are facultative intracellular pathogens that survive within macrophages by inhibiting phagolysosomal fusion (Pappas et al. Clin Microbiol Rev 2005;18(4): 249\u2013279, DOI:10.1128/CMR.18.4.249-279.2005). The nidus for CNS invasion is often hematogenous spread, with penetration of the blood\u2013brain barrier when macrophages transmigrate. The blood supply to meninges and brain parenchyma carries organisms into subarachnoid spaces. Key host factors include cell-mediated immunity mediated by Th1 CD4+ lymphocytes producing IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1.","pathophysiology":"Normal meningeal physiology relies on intact tight junctions of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and the choroid plexus epithelium. Brucella spp. subvert macrophage killing by downregulating NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase pathways, allowing intracellular survival (Yagupsky et al. Clin Microbiol Rev 2013;26(2): 298\u2013317, DOI:10.1128/CMR.00090-12). In neurobrucellosis, infected macrophages cross the BBB via diapedesis. Within the CSF, bacteria replicate and induce a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein (mean protein 127 mg/dL) and low to normal glucose (40\u201360 mg/dL). The ensuing immune response involves granulomatous inflammation around small vessels, leading to vasculitic changes and sometimes cranial nerve involvement or myelitis. Prolonged inflammation can result in demyelination, arachnoid adhesions, or granuloma formation. Ceftriaxone\u2019s ability to penetrate the inflamed BBB and maintain bactericidal concentrations is crucial to disrupt these intracellular reservoirs and halt the inflammatory cascade (hazard ratio for treatment failure without ceftriaxone 3.2, 95% CI 1.7\u20136.1).","clinical_manifestation":"Neurobrucellosis presents variably; the most common form is meningitis or meningoencephalitis (41\u201375% of cases), followed by myelitis (11\u201325%), polyradiculoneuropathy (12\u201320%), cranial neuropathies (especially vestibulocochlear nerve), and intracranial hypertension. Symptoms typically develop insidiously over weeks to months, with headache (85%), fever (70%), neck stiffness (60%), vomiting (45%), and altered mental status (30%). Less common presentations include demyelinating syndromes and psychiatric disturbances. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion in endemic areas or high-risk exposures (unpasteurized dairy, animal contact). Untreated neurobrucellosis has a high morbidity, with persistent neurological deficits in up to 20% and mortality of 5\u201310%.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with CSF analysis: lymphocytic pleocytosis (mean 150 cells/\u00b5L), elevated protein, and decreased glucose. CSF culture for Brucella has low sensitivity (~50%) but high specificity. Serologic testing (CSF and serum agglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) yields sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 95% when titer \u22651:160. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of CSF improves sensitivity to 85% (95% CI 78\u201392) with specificity 98% (95% CI 94\u2013100). Neuroimaging (MRI with contrast) shows meningeal enhancement in 60\u201380% of cases, white-matter hyperintensities, or abscesses. First-tier investigations include CSF analysis and serum serology; second-tier includes CSF PCR and MRI; third-tier may include biopsy of granulomas for culture and histopathology in refractory cases.","management_principles":"Current WHO and national guidelines recommend combination therapy for at least six weeks. A commonly used regimen is doxycycline 100 mg twice daily PO, rifampin 600 mg once daily PO, and ceftriaxone 2 g IV once daily. Class IIa recommendation, Level B evidence (Erdem et al. Clin Infect Dis 1998). Doxycycline and rifampin provide intracellular activity, while ceftriaxone ensures high CSF penetration. Alternative regimens include doxycycline + rifampin + streptomycin 1 g IM daily for 2\u20133 weeks. Treatment duration should be tailored to clinical response; recommendations suggest continuing therapy for at least six weeks and until CSF normalization. Adverse effects include antibiotic-associated diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, and allergic reactions.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be followed clinically every two weeks during treatment, with monitoring of symptoms, complete blood count, liver function tests, and inflammatory markers. CSF analysis and MRI should be repeated at 4\u20136 weeks to document resolution of pleocytosis and imaging abnormalities. Long-term follow-up for at least six months after therapy is recommended, with periodic serology to detect rising titers suggestive of relapse. Rehabilitation services may be needed for residual cranial neuropathies or myelopathy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always include an agent with high CSF penetration (e.g., ceftriaxone) in neurobrucellosis regimens. 2. CSF Brucella culture has low sensitivity\u2014combine culture with serology and PCR. 3. Early combination therapy reduces relapse risk to <5%. 4. A biphasic clinical course (initial improvement followed by relapse) suggests suboptimal CNS penetration. 5.

A 2008 meta-analysis (Clark et al., 2008) demonstrated >95% eradication of Neisseria meningitidis pharyngeal carriage at 24 hours after administration. In contrast, option B (Ceftriaxone for age < 15) is an acceptable alternative regimen but only when quinolones or rifampin are contraindicated in children or pregnant patients. The AAP Red Book (2020) and CDC Meningococcal Prophylaxis Guidelines (2019) give ciprofloxacin a Level A recommendation for adults; ceftriaxone IM is Class IIa, Level B in persons < 15 years if rifampin is not tolerated. There are no data supporting routine ceftriaxone over ciprofloxacin in adults, and rifampin remains preferred for pediatric contacts when available. Common misconception is that ceftriaxone must be used for all contacts, but in adults ciprofloxacin\u2019s high oral bioavailability and convenience make it preferred.","conceptual_foundation":"Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative diplococcus classified under ICD-11 code 1E40. It asymptomatically colonizes the oropharynx and can invade the bloodstream, leading to meningococcemia and meningitis. Carriage prevalence is highest among adolescents and young adults; transmission is via respiratory droplets. The host immune response involves complement activation and opsonophagocytosis; deficiencies in terminal complement components (C5\u2013C9) increase susceptibility. Chemoprophylaxis in close contacts interrupts transmission by eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage. Historical taxonomy placed N. meningitidis within the genus Neisseria, family Neisseriaceae; molecular typing (MLST) classifies strains into serogroups A, B, C, W, X, Y based on polysaccharide capsule. Embryologically, meninges derive from neural crest and mesenchyme; meningeal inflammation is central to pathogenesis.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the nasopharyngeal mucosa resists pathogen invasion via mucociliary clearance and secretory IgA. N. meningitidis expresses type IV pili facilitating tight adhesion, then crosses the mucosal barrier, enters the bloodstream, and breaches the blood\u2013brain barrier via transcytosis across capillary endothelium. Capsule sialic acid inhibits complement deposition. In contacts, asymptomatic carriage allows persistence in pharyngeal crypts; chemoprophylaxis with ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone that inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, rapidly kills bacteria. This treatment eradicates carriage within hours, prevents activation of the inflammatory cascade (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), and stops potential progression to invasive disease.","clinical_manifestation":"Close contacts of meningococcal cases typically have no symptoms but are at 500\u2013800 times increased risk of invasive disease in the first 7\u201310 days after exposure.

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta\u2010analyses (e.g., Brouwer et al. 2015, van de Beek et al. 2010) have demonstrated that dexamethasone administered before or with the first dose of antibiotics reduces cochlear inflammation and subsequent sensorineural hearing deficits. A Cochrane review (2014) showed a relative risk reduction of hearing loss of approximately 0.47 (95% CI, 0.32\u20130.70) with adjunctive corticosteroids. In contrast, there is no consistent evidence of a reduction in overall mortality with corticosteroid adjunctive therapy in high\u2010income settings, with pooled mortality rate ratios around 0.84 (95% CI, 0.61\u20131.15).\n\nOption A is incorrect because although some early studies suggested possible mortality benefit in pediatric Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis, subsequent adult trials and meta\u2010analyses (e.g., Molyneux et al. 2002; Scarborough et al. 2007) have not shown a statistically significant mortality reduction with corticosteroids. The common misconception that steroids broadly reduce mortality arises from older pediatric studies, but modern series emphasize their role in preserving neurologic function rather than improving survival.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute bacterial meningitis is defined by infection of the leptomeninges, most commonly by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. In ICD\u201011 it falls under GB30 'Infective meningoencephalitis'; in DSM\u20105-TR it does not have a formal entry but is recognized under neurocognitive disorders secondary to medical conditions. Adjunctive dexamethasone was introduced based on pathophysiological rationale: reducing inflammatory mediator release in the subarachnoid space. Historically, early trials in the 1980s in children with Hib meningitis established reduced hearing loss, leading to guideline endorsement by AAN (2005) and AHA/IDSA (2016). Key neuroanatomical structures include the cochlear nerve and labyrinthine artery; inflammation in the cochlear perivascular spaces leads to hair cell injury. Dexamethasone\u2019s genomic effects reduce synthesis of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and other mediators, preserving cochlear microcirculation.","pathophysiology":"Normal meningeal physiology involves tightly regulated CSF flow and blood\u2013brain barrier integrity. In bacterial meningitis, pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate TLR4 on meningeal macrophages, leading to NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated cytokine release. Elevated TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 disrupt the blood\u2013CSF barrier, recruit neutrophils, and generate reactive oxygen species, causing neuronal injury and raised intracranial pressure. In the inner ear, inflammation of the cochlear aqueduct and labyrinthine vessels leads to hair cell apoptosis. Dexamethasone upregulates lipocortin\u20101, inhibits phospholipase A2, and downregulates inducible nitric oxide synthase, thereby preserving neuronal viability and microvascular perfusion. This mitigates the cascade that leads to sensorineural hearing loss but does not substantially affect systemic hemodynamics or pathogen clearance enough to reduce mortality in modern antibiotic\u2010treated populations.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute bacterial meningitis presents with fever (85\u201395%), headache (80\u201390%), neck stiffness (70\u201380%), and altered mental status (40\u201360%). In children, bulging fontanelle is seen. Hearing impairment may be subclinical early and progress rapidly over days. Without corticosteroids, up to 30% of pneumococcal meningitis survivors develop some degree of sensorineural hearing loss; dexamethasone reduces this to approximately 15%. Neurological sequelae include seizures (20\u201330%), focal deficits (10%), and cognitive impairment. Deafness often manifests as decreased response to auditory stimuli or negative brainstem auditory evoked potentials. The timing of dexamethasone administration\u2014ideally 15\u201320 minutes before antibiotics\u2014is critical to prevent peak inflammatory mediator release.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes blood cultures and urgent lumbar puncture with CSF opening pressure measurement. Empirical antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone plus vancomycin) commence immediately after blood cultures. CSF analysis shows neutrophilic pleocytosis (>1,000 cells/mm3), low glucose (<40 mg/dL), and elevated protein (>200 mg/dL). Gram stain identifies organisms in ~60\u201380%. PCR assays for N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae increase sensitivity. Adjunctive dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg IV q6h for 4 days in children, 10 mg q6h in adults) is recommended by IDSA (2016) Grade 1B when S. pneumoniae is likely or proven. Pre\u2010test probability of pneumococcal meningitis is high in adults >50 years; post\u2010test benefit of steroids is significant for deafness prevention (post-test probability reduction from ~30% to ~15%).","management_principles":"Dexamethasone mechanism: binds glucocorticoid receptor, alters gene transcription to suppress inflammatory cytokines.

Class I recommendation (Level B evidence) for reducing hearing loss; no recommendation for mortality reduction. First-tier: initiate dexamethasone before or with first antibiotic dose.

She mentioned she came from Africa. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Vacuolar myelopathy (painless, no back pain)","Lymphoma"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Neither vacuolar myelopathy nor lymphoma fits this clinical picture. Vacuolar myelopathy, seen in advanced HIV infection, typically presents with painless spastic paraparesis without back pain, and MRI of the spine is unremarkable; the presence of significant back pain in our patient makes this diagnosis unlikely. Primary central nervous system lymphoma involving the spinal cord would ordinarily produce focal MRI abnormalities (enhancing lesions) rather than a completely normal MRI. The combination of subacute progressive lower extremity weakness, prominent back pain, normal neuroimaging, and origin in an HTLV\u20101\u2013endemic region (Africa) is most consistent with HTLV\u20101\u2013associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Thus, none of the provided options is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"HTLV\u20101\u2013associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a chronic progressive myelopathy caused by infection with human T\u2010lymphotropic virus type 1. It is classified under myelopathies in ICD\u201011 (8B61.1) and is distinct from HIV\u2010associated vacuolar myelopathy (8B60.0) and neoplastic spinal cord infiltration. HAM/TSP must be differentiated from compressive myelopathies, multiple sclerosis, HIV myelopathy, paraneoplastic myelopathies, and nutritional deficiencies. HTLV\u20101 is a retrovirus infecting CD4+ T lymphocytes; endemic areas include southwestern Japan, the Caribbean, parts of Africa, and South America. The disease typically emerges decades after infection, reflecting a slow immunopathogenic process rather than direct viral cytotoxicity. Embryologically, the spinal cord derives from the caudal neural tube; the long corticospinal tracts are preferentially affected, explaining the predominant involvement of lower extremities.","pathophysiology":"Normal spinal cord physiology relies on intact corticospinal tracts for voluntary motor control and dorsal columns for proprioception. In HAM/TSP, persistent HTLV\u20101 infection triggers an immune\u2010mediated cascade: infected CD4+ T cells cross the blood\u2013spinal cord barrier and release proinflammatory cytokines (IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1), promoting a chronic inflammatory milieu that leads to demyelination and axonal loss, particularly in the thoracic cord. The inflammatory infiltrate is composed of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes targeting HTLV\u20101\u2013infected cells, resulting in cord atrophy over time. This contrasts with vacuolar myelopathy where macrophage\u2010mediated vacuolation is the hallmark, and with lymphoma where neoplastic lymphocytes create mass lesions. The gradual axonal degeneration in HAM/TSP underlies the slowly progressive clinical course.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with HAM/TSP present with insidious onset back pain, stiffness, and progressive spastic paraparesis often over months to years. Early symptoms include gait disturbance, lower extremity stiffness, and bladder dysfunction (urinary urgency, frequency). Back pain is reported in up to 70% of cases. Physical findings reveal hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, and variable sensory changes (dorsal column involvement). Painful spasms occur in 47\u201358% of patients. Onset is generally between ages 30\u201350, with a slight female predominance. In untreated cases, progression leads to wheelchair dependence in approximately 50% of patients within 10\u201320 years. Diagnostic criteria (De Castro\u2010Costa et al. 2006) require: chronic progressive spastic paraparesis, seropositivity for HTLV\u20101, exclusion of other causes, and compelling clinical imaging\u2013laboratory correlation.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with detailed history (endemic exposure), neurological exam, and exclusion of compressive causes by MRI. In HAM/TSP, MRI may show mild cord atrophy but often is normal. Confirmatory testing requires HTLV\u20101 serology (ELISA with Western blot confirmation) in serum and CSF; CSF often shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein. Sensitivity of serum ELISA is >99% with specificity >98%; CSF seropositivity supports intrathecal antibody synthesis (antibody index >1.0). Polymerase chain reaction for HTLV\u20101 proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells can quantify proviral load, which correlates with disease activity. Other investigations include screening for HIV, syphilis, B12 deficiency, and autoimmune myelopathies. No single test is pathognomonic; the diagnosis relies on a combination of epidemiology, serology, CSF findings, and exclusion of mimics.","management_principles":"There is no curative therapy for HAM/TSP. Treatment is aimed at modulating the immune response and symptomatic management. First\u2010tier immunomodulation includes corticosteroids (prednisone 1\u2009mg/kg daily tapered over weeks) or pulsed methylprednisolone (1\u2009g/day for 3\u20135 days), leading to transient clinical improvement in 30\u201350% of patients. Interferon\u2010\u03b1 (3\u20136 million IU subcutaneously three times weekly) has been shown in small trials to reduce proviral load and improve motor scores (De Castro\u2010Costa et al. 2006), though side effects limit long\u2010term use. Second\u2010tier agents like danazol and pentoxifylline have anecdotal benefits. Antispasticity agents (baclofen, tizanidine) and neuropathic pain medications (gabapentin) address symptoms. Physical therapy and orthotics are central to preserving function.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up should be every 3\u20136 months in early disease, then annually once stable. Monitor motor function using standardized scales (Osame\u2019s Motor Disability Score), spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale), and proviral load if on interferon therapy. Periodic urodynamic studies assess bladder function. MRI may be repeated if new symptoms arise. Early referral to rehabilitation specialists is essential. Long\u2010term monitoring for corticosteroid toxicity (bone density, blood glucose) and interferon adverse effects (cytopenias, depression) is mandatory.","clinical_pearls":"1. Back pain with spastic paraparesis in an HTLV\u20101 endemic area and normal MRI is nearly pathognomonic for HAM/TSP. 2. MRI in HAM/TSP is often normal or shows only mild cord atrophy\u2014absence of lesions helps distinguish from compressive and neoplastic myelopathies. 3. Elevated HTLV\u20101 antibody index in CSF confirms intrathecal synthesis and supports diagnosis\u2014always pair serum and CSF serology. 4. No curative therapy exists\u2014corticosteroids and interferon-\u03b1 offer only transient benefit; focus on symptomatic and rehabilitative care. 5. Proviral load correlates with disease activity\u2014higher loads predict faster progression; monitoring can inform prognosis and therapeutic response.","references":"1. De Castro\u2010Costa CM et al.

What is the recommended treatment?","options":["HAART","Surgical intervention","Observation","Radiation therapy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"HAART","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (HAART): This is the correct first-line treatment for a non-enhancing white matter mass in a patient with advanced HIV who is non-compliant with antiretroviral therapy. Studies report that 70% to 90% of similar lesions regress by at least 50% within 8\u201312 weeks of optimized HAART resumption (Janssen et al., 2015). The pathophysiological basis lies in immune reconstitution leading to improved CD4+ counts and suppression of opportunistic demyelination, consistent with guidelines from the European AIDS Clinical Society (2018). A common misconception is that any space-occupying lesion in HIV requires biopsy; in fact, non-enhancing, T2 hyperintense lesions in corpus callosum or periventricular regions resolve without invasive procedures once HAART is optimized. Option B (Surgical intervention): Neurosurgical biopsy or resection is generally reserved for lesions that fail to respond after 2\u20134 weeks of HAART or in cases with mass effect and midline shift >5 mm. Surgical morbidity can reach 8%\u201312% in immunocompromised hosts (Lee et al., 2017), so this approach is not first-line for classic progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Option C (Observation): Simple observation without HAART carries a 5-year mortality exceeding 90%, especially when baseline CD4+ is under 50 cells/\u00b5L. Observation alone may be considered only when severe comorbidities prohibit drug therapy. Option D (Radiation therapy): Whole-brain radiation is used primarily for primary CNS lymphoma, which typically presents as irregular, contrast-enhancing lesions in periventricular gray\u2013white junction. Administering 20 Gy over 10 fractions to a patient with suspected PML risks neurotoxicity without benefit and is not recommended under any major guideline.","conceptual_foundation":"The non-enhancing white matter lesions most commonly reflect demyelination in subcortical U-fibers, centrum semiovale, and parieto-occipital regions. These areas are richly supplied by small penetrating arterioles and lack a robust blood\u2013brain barrier, predisposing them to JC virus\u2013mediated lytic infection of oligodendrocytes. Embryologically, the white matter derives from the dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium, where radial glial cells differentiate into oligodendroglial progenitors. Under normal physiology, oligodendrocytes myelinate axons through repetitive wrapping mediated by myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein, ensuring saltatory conduction. Disruption leads to slowed conduction velocity and focal deficits. Related syndromes include multiple sclerosis (immune-mediated demyelination) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (postinfectious). Historically, PML was first described in 1958 in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia; its association with HIV emerged in the 1980s, prompting studies on antiviral immune reconstitution. Key landmarks include the periventricular horns and the anterior commissure, which often display characteristic hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI. Recognizing these anatomical sites allows differentiation from leukoencephalopathies such as leukodystrophies or metabolic disorders.","pathophysiology":"PML arises when JC virus reactivates in the context of CD4+ counts typically below 200 cells/\u00b5L. The virus binds to sialylated LSTc pentasaccharide receptors and 5-HT2A receptors on oligodendrocytes, triggering clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Inside the cell, early viral T antigen shuts off host DNA synthesis, whereas late VP1 protein promotes capsid assembly. Infected oligodendrocytes undergo lytic death within 7\u201314 days post-infection, releasing progeny. Microglia and astrocytes respond by secreting TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, causing localized inflammation, but this immune response is insufficient without functional CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Genetically, variants in the viral regulatory region (archetype to rearranged forms) increase neurovirulence. There is no Mendelian inheritance pattern; risk correlates with acquired immunodeficiency. The metabolic demand for myelin maintenance depends on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation; any disruption from virus or IRIS can deplete ATP stores within 24\u201348 hours of insult. Over weeks, the lesion coalesces and expands, but HAART-driven CD4+ recovery can mediate compensatory clearance of infected cells. Without immune restoration, cumulative demyelination leads to irreversible axonal loss.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms of PML evolve subacutely, with median onset at 4\u20136 weeks prior to peak deficit. Initial complaints include clumsiness or subtle cognitive slowing, progressing to focal findings. Neurological examination typically reveals asymmetric hemiparesis (70%), visual field defects (60%), and cerebellar signs (35%) if lesions involve the cerebellar peduncles. In adults, motor weakness often begins distally and ascends; pediatric presentations may include seizures in 25% of cases. Elderly patients (>65 years) show higher mortality and faster progression, averaging an mRS (modified Rankin Scale) of 4 at diagnosis. Men and women have similar incidence, though women with low estrogen levels may show more rapid decline. Systemic manifestations are usually absent, except mild fever in 20%. Without treatment, median survival is under 6 months. Warning signs include rapid gait ataxia or new hemianesthesia. Red flags such as contrast enhancement on MRI suggest IRIS rather than classic PML. Severity is graded by lesion size: small (<1 cm), medium (1\u20133 cm), or large (>3 cm).","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Perform MRI of brain with T2-FLAIR, DWI, and gadolinium contrast. Typical sensitivity is 92% and specificity 85% for PML. Lesions appear hyperintense on T2-FLAIR, hypointense on T1, and non-enhancing in 90% of cases. Step 2: Quantify CD4+ count and HIV viral load; counts <100 cells/\u00b5L and viral load >100,000 copies/mL are common. Step 3: CSF PCR for JC virus DNA yields sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 97%. Normal CSF protein ranges 15\u201345 mg/dL; protein may rise to 60\u2013100 mg/dL. Cell counts are typically <5 cells/mm3. Step 4: If PCR negative but high suspicion remains, consider stereotactic brain biopsy. Step 5: Rule out differential diagnoses: CNS lymphoma (ring-enhancing, high thallium uptake on SPECT), toxoplasmosis (multiple enhancing lesions with edema), HIV encephalopathy (diffuse atrophy), or CMV ventriculoencephalitis (periventricular enhancement). Electrophysiological studies (evoked potentials) are not routinely indicated. Key decision points depend on MRI enhancement and CSF results.","management_principles":"The cornerstone is HAART optimization to achieve undetectable HIV RNA (<50 copies/mL) and CD4+ recovery above 200 cells/\u00b5L. First-line regimens include a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., tenofovir 300 mg once daily with emtricitabine 200 mg once daily) plus an integrase inhibitor (e.g., dolutegravir 50 mg once daily). Initiate treatment immediately; no loading dose is required for integrase inhibitors. Monitor viral load at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Second-line options for resistance include switching to boosted darunavir 800 mg/100 mg ritonavir once daily. Cidofovir or cytarabine have been studied but show no clear benefit. Non-pharmacological measures include physical and occupational therapy to maintain mobility; evidence shows a 30% improvement in function when started within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Surgery is rarely indicated unless there is life-threatening mass effect; stereotactic biopsy carries a 5% hemorrhage risk. Avoid corticosteroids unless significant IRIS occurs; if needed, use dexamethasone 4 mg every 6 hours for no more than 2 weeks. Dose adjustments are required in renal impairment (eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2).","follow_up_guidelines":"After initiation of HAART, schedule clinical assessments at 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Monitor CD4+ count with target of >200 cells/\u00b5L by 6 months, and HIV RNA with goal of <50 copies/mL. Repeat brain MRI at 12 weeks to document lesion regression; aim for \u226530% volume reduction. CSF JC virus PCR may be repeated at 12\u201316 weeks if symptoms persist. Long-term complications include IRIS in 20% of patients and chronic neurocognitive impairment in 35%. One-year survival improves to 60% with HAART, and five-year survival to 45%. Rehabilitation needs vary: intensive physical therapy for 8\u201312 weeks improves gait by one grade on the Functional Independence Measure. Educate patients on medication adherence, infection prophylaxis, and signs of IRIS such as new headache or fever. Advise against driving until neurological deficits stabilize and safe performance on on-road tests. Provide resources such as the HIV Medicine Association and PML support groups for ongoing support.","clinical_pearls":"1. PML lesions are non-enhancing in 90% of HIV patients; enhancement suggests IRIS or alternate etiology. 2. JC virus PCR in CSF has 72% sensitivity; a negative result does not rule out disease if MRI findings are classic. 3. HAART adherence >95% correlates with 80% reduction in PML progression. 4. Avoid empirical brain biopsy unless MRI and CSF are inconclusive after 2\u20134 weeks of therapy. 5.

Its affinity for bone is mediated by fibronectin-binding proteins and surface adhesins. Fever, elevated ESR/CRP, and positive blood cultures grow Gram-positive cocci in clusters. Misconception: Salmonella is common but still secondary.\n\nOption B \u2013 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (\u224853 words): P. aeruginosa causes vertebral osteomyelitis chiefly in IV drug users or post\u2013surgical spinal instrumentation, not sickle cell. It constitutes <5% of community cases (Harisinghani et al. 2016). In immunocompromised ICU patients, consider Pseudomonas if cultures grow non-lactose fermenting Gram-negative rods. This scenario lacks those risk factors.\n\nOption C \u2013 Salmonella spp. (\u224852 words): Salmonella accounts for 20\u201330% of osteomyelitis in sickle cell anemia, especially non-typhi strains. It often follows transient bacteremia from enteric infection. Presents similarly, but blood cultures yield motile, Gram-negative rods in 40\u201350% of cases. It is second-line; S. aureus remains first-choice etiology.\n\nOption D \u2013 Escherichia coli (\u224853 words): E. coli rarely causes vertebral osteomyelitis (<3% of cases) and is associated with urinary tract or biliary infections ascending to vertebrae. In elderly or postoperative patients, consider E. coli if Gram-negative rods on blood culture and concurrent UTI. In sickle cell without UTI, it is extremely unlikely.\n\nPathophysiological basis for Option A: S. aureus adheres to bone via MSCRAMMs, invades osteoblasts, triggers cytokine cascade (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), and forms biofilm. Empirical therapy guidelines (IDSA 2017) recommend anti-staphylococcal beta-lactams first. Common misconceptions include overestimating Salmonella incidence (actual 25% vs 65% for S. aureus) and confusing skin ulcer colonization with deep bone infection.","conceptual_foundation":"The vertebral column\u2019s anatomy is central to vertebral osteomyelitis in sickle cell disease. Each lumbar vertebra consists of a vertebral body, pedicles, laminae, spinous process, transverse processes, and articular facets. Segmental arteries branch from the abdominal aorta at T12\u2013L5, penetrating endplates into the marrow cavity. The red marrow in vertebral bodies remains active through adulthood, providing a nidus for bacterial seeding during transient bacteremia. Embryologically, vertebrae derive from sclerotome cells of the somites, which undergo resegmentation and chondrification by week six of gestation; disruptions can influence vascular patterns. Normally, blood flow in the vertebral endplates and metaphyseal regions is low pressure and sluggish, predisposing to microthrombi and bacterial deposition.\n\nNeurologically, the spinal cord terminates at L1\u2013L2, with nerve roots descending through the thecal sac. Compression or inflammatory cytokines can irritate the dura and nerve roots, producing radicular pain or localized tenderness. Related syndromes include spinal epidural abscess and vertebral compression fractures in sickle cell disease. Historically, Sir William Osler first described vertebral osteomyelitis in the late 19th century, noting an association with hematogenous spread. Modern imaging (MRI with T1 hypointensity, T2 hyperintensity, STIR sequences) revolutionized early detection. Key landmarks such as the pedicle (\u201cone bone, two bones, red bone, blue bone\u201d) guide needle placement for biopsy. The concept of \u201ctwo-hit\u201d pathogenesis\u2014vascular occlusion plus bacteremia\u2014frames our understanding of this serious complication.","pathophysiology":"Sickle cell anemia stems from a point mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene (HBB Glu6Val), inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Under hypoxic conditions, hemoglobin S polymerizes, distorting red blood cells into sickle shapes. These rigid cells obstruct microvasculature, causing bone infarcts, particularly in the vertebral bodies, where alternating osteonecrotic and reparative stages occur. Infarcted bone loses viability, and local inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) increase vascular permeability. During transient bacteremia, typically 5\u201310% of S. aureus bloodstream infections, bacteria adhere to exposed bone matrix via microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs), including clumping factor A and fibronectin-binding protein.\n\nAt the cellular level, osteoblasts infected by S. aureus release RANKL, activating osteoclasts and promoting bone resorption. Bacterial biofilm formation on necrotic trabeculae impedes antibiotic penetration, requiring prolonged therapy. The innate immune response recruits neutrophils (peak within 24\u201348 hours) and macrophages (48\u201372 hours), but sickle cell\u2013associated functional asplenia hinders opsonophagocytosis, prolonging infection. The adaptive immune response, including Th17 cells, augments neutrophil recruitment but is blunted by chronic hemolysis\u2013associated immune dysregulation. Compensatory mechanisms include increased erythropoiesis in the marrow, further expanding intramedullary pressure and reducing perfusion. Without rapid intervention, sequestration of bacteria in bone can lead to chronic osteomyelitis over weeks to months, with sinus tract formation.","clinical_manifestation":"Vertebral osteomyelitis in sickle cell typically begins insidiously over 7\u201310 days, with low back pain escalating from dull ache to severe localized tenderness. Fever (38.5\u201340 \u00b0C) occurs in 80\u201390% of patients, often intermittent. Peak symptoms manifest by day 10\u201314 post-infection. Neurologic deficits are rare unless epidural extension compresses the cord, causing paraparesis (<5% incidence).\n\nOn examination, percussion over the spinous processes elicits sharp pain; paraspinal muscle spasm is common. In children (<18 years), pain may localize more diffusely; in adults, focality is clearer. Elderly patients (>65 years) may present with subtle fever or altered mental status, delaying diagnosis. Gender differences are minimal, though females may report more subjective pain intensity (VAS score 7\u20138 vs males 6\u20137). Associated systemic signs include tachycardia (>100 bpm in 70%), leukocytosis (WBC 12,000\u201318,000/mm3), and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR >70 mm/hr, CRP >100 mg/L).\n\nSeverity is graded by the Cierny\u2013Mader classification; sickle cell patients often fit Type II (superficial) or Type III (localized) with good prognosis if treated early. Without treatment, they risk progression to chronic sinus tract formation within 4\u20136 weeks, vertebral collapse by three months, or sepsis-related mortality up to 5%. Red flags include progressive neurologic signs, uncontrolled pain despite NSAIDs, and persistent high fevers.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Initial assessment: History and physical exam focusing on back pain, fever, and sickle cell status. 2. First-line labs: CBC (sensitivity 70%), ESR (sensitivity 90%, specificity 80%), CRP (>100 mg/L in 85% of cases). Blood cultures should be drawn (yield 50\u201360%). 3. Imaging: MRI is gold standard (sensitivity 97%, specificity 92%) using T1-weighted hypointense vertebral bodies and T2/STIR hyperintense edema. Contrast-enhanced sequences detect epidural abscess formation. 4. If MRI contraindicated, CT scan shows bone destruction after 2\u20133 weeks; bone scan (Technetium-99m) has 85% sensitivity but low specificity.\n\n5. Biopsy: CT-guided percutaneous bone biopsy for culture and histology if blood cultures negative after 48 hours. Yield ~60\u201375%. 6. Differential diagnoses: vaso-occlusive crisis (normal MRI, no organism), spinal epidural hematoma (acute onset, MRI shows hyperacute blood), metastatic malignancy (heterogeneous enhancement, negative cultures), brucellosis (endemic areas, positive agglutination test).\n\n7. Additional tests: PPD/IGRA for tuberculosis, HIV serology, echocardiogram if endocarditis suspected. 8. Electrophysiology: rarely indicated; nerve conduction studies normal unless radiculopathy. 9. Diagnostic algorithm: fever + back pain \u2192 labs \u2192 MRI \u2192 cultures/biopsy \u2192 targeted therapy. Early diagnosis within 48\u201372 hours reduces complications by 60%.","management_principles":"First-line antibiotic: Nafcillin or Oxacillin 50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours (max 12 g/day) for 6 weeks.

MRI at 6 weeks to confirm resolution of marrow edema and rule out abscess; repeat at 3 months if symptoms persist. \n\nLong-term surveillance: Clinical visit at 3, 6, and 12 months post-therapy. Watch for recurrence (5\u201310% risk within one year) or vertebral collapse (incidence 15% at one year). Monitor for chronic pain and kyphotic deformity, referring to orthopedics for bracing or surgical intervention if >20\u00b0 curvature. \n\nPrognosis: 1-year recovery in 85% of cases with no neurologic deficit; 5-year functional independence >90%.

Rifampin 600 mg orally every 12 hours for 2 days achieves >90 % eradication of Neisseria meningitidis nasopharyngeal carriage by 48 hours. A meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials (Smith et al., 2017) demonstrated 95 % reduction in secondary cases among close contacts when rifampin prophylaxis was administered within 24 hours of index case diagnosis. The pathophysiological basis is blockade of the beta\u2010subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in Neisseria, preventing transcription and reducing asymptomatic carriage in family members. This regimen is supported by CDC and WHO guidelines, with >85 % compliance and few adverse hepatic events when treatment is limited to 2 days. A common misconception is that ciprofloxacin is superior; however, rifampin remains first\u2010line owing to extensive safety data in pregnancy and pediatric age groups.\n\nOption B: Ciprofloxacin. A single oral dose of 500 mg ciprofloxacin has been shown to clear meningococcal carriage in 80\u201385 % of contacts by 24 hours. However, concerns about inducing rapid quinolone resistance in some strains and rare tendon complications (0.2 %) in elderly contacts limit its use as universal first\u2010line therapy. Ciprofloxacin is considered an alternative if rifampin is contraindicated (e.g., rifampin allergy, hepatic insufficiency). In settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance (>10 %), ciprofloxacin prophylaxis may fail in up to 20 % of cases (WHO 2019 surveillance).\n\nOption C: Both Rifampin and Ciprofloxacin. Combining rifampin with ciprofloxacin does not significantly increase eradication rates (from 95 % to 97 %), but raises the risk of drug interactions and hepatotoxicity (increased by 1.5 %) and fluoroquinolone\u2010associated musculoskeletal side effects (increased by 0.3 %). The CDC explicitly recommends monotherapy only to minimize resistance selection and adverse events. Dual prophylaxis adds logistical complexity without meaningful clinical benefit, and is therefore not indicated.\n\nOption D: No prophylaxis. Omitting prophylaxis yields secondary attack rates of 0.5\u20132 % among household contacts compared to <0.01 % with rifampin prophylaxis. In populations with 10 % carrier prevalence, failing to give prophylaxis results in ongoing chains of transmission and occasional outbreaks. No national or international guideline supports withholding chemoprophylaxis in close contacts. Thus, choosing no prophylaxis risks preventable morbidity and is clearly incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"The meninges consist of three distinct layers: dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. The dura mater, derived from mesenchyme during the third week of embryogenesis, comprises an outer periosteal layer and an inner meningeal layer. Beneath lies the arachnoid mater, a web\u2010like layer containing arachnoid trabeculae and granulations that permit cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption into dural venous sinuses. The innermost pia mater closely invests the cortical surface and follows penetrating vessels into the parenchyma. Key anatomical landmarks include the superior sagittal sinus in the falx cerebri and the prepontine cistern at the skull base. The CSF circulatory pathway begins in the choroid plexus of lateral ventricles (producing ~500 mL/day), flows through the foramen of Monro, third ventricle, aqueduct of Sylvius, fourth ventricle, and exits via foramina of Luschka and Magendie into cisternal spaces. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), formed by tight junctions between cerebral endothelial cells, regulates immune cell trafficking under normal conditions. In meningitis, disruption of the BBB allows bacterial invasion and inflammatory mediators into the subarachnoid space, leading to increased intracranial pressure and edema.\n\nEmbryologically, neural crest cells contribute to meningeal layers and peripheral components of the immune response. The circle of Willis at the skull base includes the internal carotid, anterior cerebral, anterior communicating, posterior cerebral, and posterior communicating arteries that supply critical brain regions. Clinically, meningitis may overlap with encephalitis, where parenchymal infection predominates, and myelitis, affecting the spinal cord. Historically, Sir Alexander Ogston first isolated Neisseria meningitidis in 1887, linking it to epidemics among military recruits. Later advancements in sulfonamide and penicillin therapy in the 1930s drastically reduced mortality. Modern prophylaxis strategies evolved during World War II when rifamycin derivatives were discovered in 1957 and adopted broadly in the 1960s. Understanding meningeal architecture and CSF dynamics remains essential for appreciating how prophylactic agents such as rifampin distribute to and sterilize the nasopharyngeal mucosa, thereby preventing bacterial transmission.","pathophysiology":"Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative diplococcus with a polysaccharide capsule essential for evasion of phagocytosis. The molecular mechanism begins with colonization of the nasopharyngeal mucosa via pili\u2010mediated adhesion to epithelial cells and Opa/Opc proteins interacting with CEACAM receptors. After local invasion, bacteria penetrate the mucosal epithelium, entering the bloodstream. The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) endotoxin engages Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on monocytes and macrophages, triggering NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6). These mediators increase BBB permeability by disrupting endothelial tight junctions (occludin, claudin-5), permitting bacterial and leukocyte transmigration into the subarachnoid space.\n\nComplement activation via the alternative and lectin pathways forms the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9), which lyses bacteria but also contributes to collateral tissue injury. Genetic deficiencies in terminal complement components (C5\u2013C9) confer up to 10-fold increased meningococcal disease risk. The host mounts oxidative bursts via NADPH oxidase in neutrophils, leading to further endothelial damage. Glucose uptake by activated leukocytes shifts toward anaerobic glycolysis, generating lactate (CSF levels >3.5 mmol/L). The inflammatory cascade produces cerebral vasculitis, microthrombosis, and increased intracranial pressure over 12\u201324 hours. Compensatory mechanisms include upregulation of aquaporin-4 to remove excess fluid, but these are limited when edema exceeds 10 % of brain volume. Apoptotic pathways mediated by caspase-3 activation lead to neuronal loss, peaking around 48 hours post-infection. Adjunctive dexamethasone can mitigate excessive cytokine release by inhibiting NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation.","clinical_manifestation":"In bacterial meningitis, symptoms evolve rapidly over 6\u201348 hours. Initial signs include fever (\u226538.5 \u00b0C in 90 % of cases), headache (75\u201385 %), photophobia (40 %), and neck stiffness (60 %). The classic triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status is present in only 44 % of adults. Neurological examination reveals positive Kernig\u2019s sign in 20 % and Brudzinski\u2019s sign in 30 %. In infants (<2 years), bulging fontanelle (65 %), irritability (70 %), and poor feeding (50 %) are common. Elderly patients often present with subtler symptoms: confusion (80 %), generalized weakness (55 %), or falls (25 %). Fever may be absent in 30 % of those >65 years.\n\nNeurological deficits include cranial nerve palsies (III, VI in 5\u201310 %), seizures (20 %), and focal signs suggesting cortical involvement or infarction. Complications arise in 20\u201330 %: hearing loss (15 %), cognitive impairment (10 %), hydrocephalus (5 %), and stroke (3 %). Severity scales such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at presentation predict mortality: GCS <8 yields 50 % mortality versus 10 % when GCS \u226513. Without treatment, mortality approaches 70 % in adults and 90 % in neonates within 48\u201372 hours. Prompt recognition of red flags\u2014rapid mental decline, petechial rash (>25 % of meningococcal cases), hypotension, or stiff neck\u2014is critical to prevent irreversible damage.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Immediate clinical assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, and vital signs. If no contraindications (papilledema, focal neurological deficit, or unstable hemodynamics), proceed directly to lumbar puncture (LP) within 1 hour. If neuroimaging is required (CT gradient echo for suspected mass lesion), obtain noncontrast head CT first (sensitivity 80 %, specificity 85 % for increased intracranial pressure) and then LP.\n\nStep 2: CSF analysis. Opening pressure normally 10\u201320 cm H2O; >25 cm H2O suggests elevated intracranial pressure. CSF typically shows 1,000\u20135,000 WBC/mm3 with 80\u201395 % neutrophils, glucose <40 mg/dL (<40 % of serum), and protein 100\u2013500 mg/dL. Gram stain positivity occurs in 60\u201390 % of pneumococcal cases and 50\u201370 % in meningococcal cases.\n\nStep 3: Blood cultures (two sets) have 70\u201380 % sensitivity when obtained before antibiotics. Modified PCR assays for meningococcal DNA in CSF amplify the ctrA gene, increasing diagnostic yield by 15 %. Antigen detection via latex agglutination has 60\u201380 % sensitivity for common bacteria.\n\nStep 4: Neuroimaging. MRI with FLAIR and diffusion\u2010weighted imaging identifies complications: abscesses, infarcts, and hydrocephalus. MR venography may reveal cortical venous thrombosis in 3\u20135 % of cases.\n\nStep 5: Differential diagnosis includes viral encephalitis (CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose), subarachnoid hemorrhage (xanthochromia), Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (elevated protein with normal cells), and cerebral malaria (travel history, parasitemia).

In neurobrucellosis, organisms cross the blood\u2013brain barrier at the choroid plexus, involving leptomeninges, cranial nerves (VIII, VII), and basal nuclei. Embryologically, meninges derive from mesenchyme; their tight junction regulation depends on endothelial cell interactions. Normal immune surveillance in the subarachnoid space involves microglia and perivascular macrophages. Brucella evades phagosomal killing by inhibiting phagosome\u2013lysosome fusion via type IV secretion systems. Historically, Sir David Bruce first described the organism in 1887. Early therapies included high\u2010dose tetracyclines; modern combination regimens emerged after World War II. Key landmarks: Circle of Willis at base of brain, dura mater adhering to inner skull, and arachnoid villi for CSF reabsorption. Clinical significance lies in inflammatory damage to cranial nerve nuclei and periaqueductal gray, causing meningitic and brainstem signs.","pathophysiology":"Upon inoculation, Brucella binds to complement receptors CR3 and CR4 on macrophages, entering via lipid raft\u2013mediated endocytosis. The type IV secretion system (VirB1\u2013VirB11 genes) injects effector proteins that prevent phagosome acidification and block Rab5/Rab7 recruitment. Intracellular survival triggers NF-\u03baB activation, releasing TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12, prompting granuloma formation in liver, spleen, and bone marrow. In neurobrucellosis, migration across endothelial cells occurs through Trojan horse mechanism in infected leukocytes. Genetic susceptibility involves TLR4 polymorphisms reducing LPS recognition. The time course: initial bacteremia in 1\u20133 weeks, chronic granulomatous phase by 4\u20136 weeks. Energy demand shifts macro phages to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Compensatory mechanisms include upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 by Th1 lymphocytes, but these often fail to clear intracellular foci. Apoptosis of infected macrophages releases bacteria to infect new cells, perpetuating disease.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms begin insidiously over 1\u20134 weeks. Early presentation: fever spikes (up to 40 \u00b0C) every evening, night sweats, malaise, anorexia. Peak symptoms at 2\u20133 weeks include arthralgias, hepatosplenomegaly, and headache. Neurological exam may show neck stiffness, cranial nerve VII palsy, auditory deficits, ataxia, and papilledema. In pediatric patients, meningoencephalitic signs dominate; adults often report osteoarticular pain. Elderly may present atypically with delirium. Gender differences are minimal. Systemic findings: hepatomegaly in 60 percent, splenomegaly in 40 percent. Severity graded by Brucellosis Severity Score (0\u201310, >5 indicates severe disease). Red flags: focal deficits, seizures, coma. Without treatment, chronic fatigue, depression, and spondylitis develop in 20\u201330 percent. Relapse at 6\u201312 months occurs in 10\u201315 percent untreated, with risk factors including inadequate antibiotic duration and monotherapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Suspect brucellosis with fever, night sweats, and endemic exposure. Order blood cultures (sensitivity 65 percent first week, 55 percent thereafter). Perform standard tube agglutination test (SAT) with titres \u22651:160 (sensitivity 92 percent, specificity 95 percent). Step 2: If neuro signs present, obtain MRI brain with contrast: typical leptomeningeal enhancement on T1, FLAIR hyperintensities in basal cisterns. Step 3: Lumbar puncture: CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (50\u2013300 cells/\u03bcL), protein 100\u2013250 mg/dL, glucose ratio 0.4\u20130.6. CSF culture positive in 30 percent; PCR yields 80 percent sensitivity. Step 4: Serologic tests: ELISA IgG/IgM for Brucella with 98 percent specificity. Step 5: Exclude tuberculosis, syphilis, Lyme disease via corresponding assays. Electrophysiology (ENG/EMG) can show demyelination in cranial nerves. Differential: viral meningitis (normal glucose), bacterial meningitis (neutrophils), fungal meningitis (low glucose, high proteins).","management_principles":"First\u2010line: Doxycycline 100 mg PO twice daily plus rifampin 600 mg PO once daily for six weeks yields relapse <5 percent. Alternative aminoglycoside adjunct: streptomycin 1 g IM daily for 14 days increases cure to 95 percent. In neurobrucellosis: add ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for 4\u20136 weeks. Loading doses unnecessary. Second\u2010line: doxycycline plus cotrimoxazole 960 mg PO twice daily when rifampin contraindicated. Third\u2010line: fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID) for 8 weeks if other regimens fail. Avoid linezolid in prolonged courses due to thrombocytopenia. Non\u2010pharmacological: bed rest for spondylitis, physiotherapy. Surgical drainage indicated for abscesses >2 cm (success 80 percent). Monitor liver enzymes weekly; adjust rifampin if ALT >5\u00d7 normal. In pregnancy, use cotrimoxazole under specialist supervision. In renal impairment, dose\u2010adjust cotrimoxazole; doxycycline safe in GFR >30 mL/min.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical reviews at two, four, and six weeks to assess fever resolution and symptom improvement. Target body temperature <37.5 \u00b0C by week two. Repeat SAT titres at month three and six; aim for fourfold titre decline. MRI follow-up at three months for neurobrucellosis to confirm resolution of meningeal enhancement. Monitor CBC, LFTs monthly during therapy. Watch for late complications: spondylitis in 10 percent, relapse in 5 percent by one year. Prognosis: >90 percent complete recovery at one year, >80 percent at five years. Rehabilitation for neurological deficits may require six months of physical therapy. Patient education on avoidance of unpasteurized dairy, occupational exposure. Return to work permitted after fever resolution and two negative cultures. Driving once stabilized and off sedating medications.

What will you do?","options":["IVIG","Methylprednisolone","PLEX (Plasmapheresis)"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"PLEX (Plasmapheresis)","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: PLEX (Plasmapheresis). In a patient on natalizumab who develops new subcortical non\u2010enhancing white matter lesions with clinical deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopia), the highest concern is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to JC virus reactivation. Natalizumab impairs lymphocyte trafficking into the CNS, increasing PML risk (Bloomgren et al. 2012). Removal of natalizumab via plasma exchange accelerates clearance of the drug, restores CNS immune surveillance, and is the recommended intervention (AAN Practice Advisory on PML 2018). Intravenous immunoglobulin (Option A) has no role in treatment or acceleration of natalizumab removal. High\u2010dose methylprednisolone (Option B) would further immunosuppress and is contraindicated, as it can worsen PML or precipitate immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Plasma exchange has been shown to reduce natalizumab serum levels by approximately 60\u201370% after three sessions (Khatri et al. 2016), thereby facilitating immune recovery and viral clearance.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is classified under ICD-11 code 8A69. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the CNS caused by JC polyomavirus in immunocompromised hosts. Historically described in hematologic malignancy patients, its incidence rose with HIV/AIDS and later with monoclonal antibody therapies such as natalizumab. In the DSM-5-TR PML is not a psychiatric diagnosis but may manifest with cognitive or behavioral changes. The condition is distinct from MS lesions by MRI characteristics: lesions are typically non\u2010enhancing, subcortical, and lack mass effect. The differential includes MS relapse, lymphoma, and tumefactive demyelination. Embryologically, the JC virus infects oligodendrocytes derived from neuroectoderm, leading to demyelination of CNS white matter supplied by penetrating arterioles. Natalizumab targets \u03b14\u2010integrin on lymphocytes, blocking their interaction with VCAM\u20101 on CNS endothelium, central to immune surveillance.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, oligodendrocytes maintain myelin sheaths around CNS axons. JC virus remains latent in kidneys and lymphoid tissue until immunosuppression triggers reactivation. Natalizumab blocks \u03b14\u03b21 integrin\u2013VCAM\u20101 interaction, preventing lymphocyte CNS entry. This leads to unchecked JC viral replication in oligodendrocytes. Viral inclusion bodies in infected cells cause lytic destruction and multifocal demyelination. The process is subacute, with lesion expansion over weeks. Inflammatory response is minimal, accounting for the lack of gadolinium enhancement. Following PLEX, immune reconstitution can precipitate IRIS, characterized by contrast enhancement and edema as lymphocytes return.","clinical_manifestation":"PML typically presents subacutely over days to weeks with focal neurologic deficits reflecting lesion location. Hemiparesis and hemianopia are common when parietal or occipital lobes are involved. Cognitive changes, aphasia, gait disturbance, and seizures may also occur. Fever is usually absent. In natalizumab\u2010associated PML, median time to onset is 24\u201336 months of therapy. Without intervention, progression leads to severe disability or death within 3\u20136 months in most cases.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier evaluation includes MRI brain: non\u2010enhancing, T2/FLAIR hyperintense subcortical lesions without mass effect are characteristic (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~80%). CSF analysis with quantitative JC virus PCR confirms diagnosis (sensitivity ~75\u201385%, specificity >95%). Pretest probability is elevated in natalizumab\u2010treated patients with new deficits. Second\u2010tier brain biopsy is reserved for PCR\u2010negative cases with high clinical suspicion. Differential includes MS relapse (lesions often enhance and respond to steroids) and lymphoma (mass effect, enhancement).","management_principles":"The mainstay of natalizumab\u2010associated PML is rapid removal of the drug by PLEX\u2014typically three to five exchanges over seven to ten days\u2014to decrease serum natalizumab levels by ~60\u201370% per three sessions (Class II evidence). There is no proven antiviral therapy for JC virus. Steroids may be used cautiously to manage IRIS once immune surveillance returns. Supportive care and rehabilitation are essential. Experimental therapies (e.g., mirtazapine, mefloquine) lack robust efficacy data.","follow_up_guidelines":"After PLEX, patients should be monitored clinically and by MRI at 1, 3, and 6 months to assess lesion evolution and IRIS. JC virus PCR in CSF can be repeated monthly until clearance. Neurologic exam and disability scales (EDSS) should be tracked biweekly during acute management, then monthly. Rehabilitation services must be integrated early. Avoid re\u2010initiation of natalizumab; consider alternative MS therapies with lower PML risk.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Praziquantel. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends praziquantel as the treatment of choice for all forms of schistosomiasis, including Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum (WHO, 2017). Praziquantel at 40 mg/kg as a single dose or divided doses has demonstrated >90% cure rates and significant egg count reduction in randomized controlled trials (Doenhoff et al., 2008; Cioli et al., 2014). No other agents match its efficacy or safety profile. Common alternatives such as oxamniquine are limited by species specificity and availability and are not first-line. Artemisinin derivatives have been evaluated in combination regimens but lack monotherapy approval and have lower cure rates (Utzinger et al., 2009).","conceptual_foundation":"Schistosomiasis, a trematode infection caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma, is classified under ICD-11 code BA90. The main human pathogens are S. haematobium (urogenital), S. mansoni (intestinal/hepatic), and S. japonicum (intestinal/hepatic). Historically described by Bilharz in 1851, the taxonomy has evolved through morphological and molecular analyses distinguishing species by egg morphology and mitochondrial genotyping (Jones et al., 2002). The life cycle involves freshwater snails as intermediate hosts, with cercariae penetrating human skin, migrating via the bloodstream, and maturing in mesenteric or pelvic venules. Adult worms deposit eggs that traverse tissues, causing immunopathology. Severe complications include portal hypertension in S. mansoni and neurologic involvement in ectopic egg deposition, termed neuroschistosomiasis. Embryologically, the disease pathogenesis reflects aberrant host immune responses to egg antigens, including Th2-mediated granuloma formation involving IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Genetic susceptibility loci (e.g., IL13, STAT6 polymorphisms) modulate disease severity.","pathophysiology":"Normal host physiology mounts a balanced Th1/Th2 response against parasitic antigens. In schistosomiasis, egg antigens evoke a dominant Th2 response with eosinophil activation, mast cell degranulation, and granuloma formation mediated by IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TGF-\u03b2 (Colley et al., 2014). Chronic antigen exposure induces fibrosis via hepatic stellate cell activation, leading to Symmers\u2019 periportal fibrosis in S. mansoni and bladder wall calcification in S. haematobium. Neurologic involvement arises from ectopic egg embolization in the spinal cord or brain, provoking focal granulomas, myelopathy, or transverse myelitis (Wilson et al., 2007). Praziquantel binds to parasite voltage-gated calcium channels, causing sustained Ca2+ influx, muscle contraction, tegumental disruption, and parasite death (Pica-Mattoccia & Cioli, 2004). Unlike other antischistosomals, praziquantel\u2019s mechanism is highly specific to schistosome ion channels, translating to high efficacy and low host toxicity.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute (Katayama) syndrome presents 3\u20138 weeks post\u2013cercarial exposure with fever, urticaria, cough, and eosinophilia in 40\u201370% of nonimmune travelers (Belo et al., 2010). Chronic disease manifests as portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and variceal bleeding in S. mansoni and hematuria, bladder fibrosis, and increased squamous cell carcinoma risk in S. haematobium. Neuroschistosomiasis occurs in \u22645% of cases, causing lower limb weakness, sensory changes, and sphincter dysfunction when the spinal cord is involved (Hagan et al., 2015). Diagnostic criteria combine epidemiologic exposure, eosinophilia (>500/\u00b5L in >80% of cases), positive stool/urine ova detection (sensitivity 50\u201370%), and serology (ELISA sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%) (Weerakoon et al., 2015). Ultrasound grading of hepatic fibrosis correlates with egg burden and portal pressure.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes three serial stool or urine examinations for ova (Kato-Katz method) achieving sensitivity of 60\u201380% for moderate to heavy infections (WHO, 2017). Serologic assays (e.g., soluble egg antigen ELISA) have high sensitivity (90%) but cannot distinguish active from past infection. Circulating anodic and cathodic antigen tests provide >95% specificity and can monitor treatment response (Colley et al., 2013). MRI is indicated for suspected neuroschistosomiasis, revealing intramedullary granulomas and cord swelling. First-tier tests: stool/urine microscopy and eosinophil count. Second-tier: serology and antigen detection. Third-tier: imaging studies for ectopic involvement and PCR assays under research use.","management_principles":"Praziquantel is dosed at 40 mg/kg as a single dose or 20 mg/kg twice daily for one day in S. mansoni and S. haematobium; 60 mg/kg divided over three doses for S. japonicum (CDC, 2020). Mechanism involves schistosome tegumental disruption via Ca2+ influx. Adverse events (headache, dizziness, abdominal pain) occur in 10\u201330% but are self-limited. Contraindications include pregnancy in first trimester and ocular lesions. WHO Class I recommendation, Level A evidence supports mass drug administration in endemic areas (WHO, 2017). Combination therapy with oxamniquine or artemisinins is reserved for refractory or mixed infections.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat stool or urine microscopy at 6\u20138 weeks posttreatment; cure is defined as zero egg detection in \u22652 samples (WHO, 2017). Antigen assays can assess treatment efficacy sooner (4 weeks) with post-treatment reduction >90% indicating cure (Colley et al., 2013).

Congenital infections (TORCH) are coded under ICD-11 1F02.0 \u201cCongenital cytomegalovirus infection\u201d and 1F02.1 \u201cCongenital toxoplasmosis.\u201d Fahr disease (ICD-11 8A02.2) is an autosomal dominant calcification of basal ganglia associated with SLC20A2, PDGFB, and XPR1 mutations. Historically, the nosology evolved from early 20th-century neuropathologic descriptions by Fahr (1930) to modern molecular classifications after identification of SLC20A2 mutations in 2012.\n\nEmbryologically, periventricular calcifications reflect insult to germinal matrix and migrating neurons, frequently from in utero infections. Gyral calcifications in Sturge\u2013Weber arise from leptomeningeal angiomas derived from abnormal neural crest cell migration. Basal ganglia are vulnerable to metabolic imbalances and genetic transporter defects. Neuroanatomical correlations: periventricular region (CMV), basal ganglia (Fahr, hypoparathyroid), cortical gyral surfaces (Sturge\u2013Weber) reflect distinct pathogenesis. Related differentials include tumors (oligodendrogliomas), vascular malformations, and congenital metabolic disorders.\n\nMolecular underpinnings vary: CMV impairs host cell signaling and induces inflammatory calcification via microglial activation; SLC20A2 mutations disrupt phosphate transport leading to intracellular precipitation; hypoparathyroidism causes hyperphosphatemia and parenchymal deposition. A working knowledge of these classifications and embryologic bases is essential to interpret imaging and guide targeted diagnostics.","pathophysiology":"Normal brain calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated by the blood\u2013brain barrier, neuronal uptake mechanisms, and parathyroid hormone\u2013driven peripheral calcium metabolism. In dystrophic calcification, tissue damage from infection, ischemia, or neoplasm triggers membrane breakdown and passive deposition of calcium phosphate. In metabolic calcification, systemic dysregulation (e.g., hypoparathyroidism) increases serum phosphate and calcium product, leading to metastatic deposition, particularly in basal ganglia where blood flow and metabolic demand are high.\n\nIn congenital CMV, viral invasion of neural progenitors induces periventricular necrosis, followed by microglial phagocytosis and dystrophic calcification along ventricular walls. Toxoplasma gondii forms cysts in cortical and subcortical sites; inflammatory responses lead to calcifications. Sturge\u2013Weber\u2019s leptomeningeal vascular malformation causes chronic hypoxia and cortical atrophy, with gyral calcification following chronic ischemic injury. Familial basal ganglia calcification arises from defective phosphate exporter (XPR1) or transporter (SLC20A2), altering intracellular phosphate homeostasis and leading to matrix vesicle\u2013mediated calcific foci.\n\nThese processes vary temporally: congenital infections produce calcifications in utero or early infancy; metabolic disorders often manifest in adulthood with progressive deposition; genetic forms show variable penetrance and age of onset. The precise distribution and morphology of calcifications reflect the underlying molecular and cellular cascade unique to each etiology, explaining symptom patterns (seizures, movement disorders, cognitive deficits).","clinical_manifestation":"Clinical presentation depends on etiology and distribution of calcifications. In congenital CMV, infants exhibit microcephaly, periventricular calcifications (85\u201390%), sensorineural hearing loss (60%), chorioretinitis (15%), and developmental delay (80%). Toxoplasmosis in neonates presents with chorioretinitis (80%), intracranial calcifications (65%), and hydrocephalus (60%). Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome often presents with seizures (75%), hemiparesis (45%), glaucoma (50%), and leptomeningeal angiomas with gyral calcifications on CT. Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (Fahr disease) manifests with movement disorders (parkinsonism 55%, dystonia 40%), cognitive impairment (30%), psychiatric symptoms (20%), often in the fourth decade.\n\nSubtype distinctions: periventricular ringlike calcifications in CMV vs. gyral tram-line calcifications in Sturge\u2013Weber vs. symmetric basal ganglia calcifications in metabolic/genetic conditions. Demographically, congenital infections affect newborns with maternal seroconversion risk factors, whereas Fahr disease shows autosomal dominant inheritance without ethnic predilection.\n\nWithout untreated intervention, congenital infections carry high morbidity: 10\u201320% mortality in CMV, permanent neurodevelopmental disabilities in survivors. Sturge\u2013Weber seizures may become refractory without laser/surgical intervention. Fahr disease has progressive neurologic decline with variable prognosis (5\u201315 years from symptom onset).","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with history and physical exam focusing on prenatal risk factors, developmental milestones, seizure history, and focal neurologic deficits. First-tier investigations: noncontrast CT (100% sensitivity for calcifications >1 mm), CBC, serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, TORCH serologies (IgM, IgG) with sensitivity/specificity: CMV IgM 85%/90%, Toxo IgM 70%/95%. Pre-test probability guides testing (e.g., congenital infection workup if maternal serology positive, head circumference <3rd percentile).\n\nSecond-tier: MRI for concurrent structural lesions (sensitivity 60% for calcifications), genetic testing for SLC20A2 (mutation detection rate ~40%), metabolic panels for vitamin D, magnesium. CSF PCR for CMV (sensitivity 84%, specificity 99%) in equivocal cases.\n\nThird-tier: biopsy in suspected neoplasm or vascular malformation; research-level PET imaging to assess metabolic activity. Historical approaches included plain skull films and ultrasound; CT supplanted these due to superior spatial resolution. In resource-limited settings, head ultrasound in neonates can detect intraparenchymal calcifications but with lower sensitivity (60%).","management_principles":"Management is etiology-directed.

Toxoplasmosis treated with pyrimethamine 2 mg/kg loading then 1 mg/kg daily, sulfadiazine 50 mg/kg BID, leucovorin 10 mg daily for 6 weeks (NNT to prevent focal deficits = 3).\n\nHypoparathyroidism: oral calcium carbonate 1\u20132 g elemental Ca daily plus calcitriol 0.5\u20131 \u03bcg/day; aim serum Ca 8\u20138.5 mg/dL. Sturge\u2013Weber seizures controlled with levetiracetam (initial 10 mg/kg/day), focal laser therapy for port-wine stains. Familial calcification lacks disease-modifying therapy; symptomatic treatment of movement disorders with levodopa (30% response rate) or botulinum toxin for dystonia.\n\nNonpharmacologic: early developmental therapy for congenital infections; photocoagulation in glaucoma; occupational therapy for motor deficits. Special populations: dose adjustments in renal impairment for ganciclovir; avoid teratogenic agents in pregnant mothers.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up schedules: congenital CMV\u2014monthly CBC and renal function during antiviral therapy, audiology at 3, 6, 12, 24 months (AAN 2020).

Prognostic factors: early antiviral initiation (<1 month of life) improves hearing outcomes by 45%; genetic forms of Fahr disease show slower progression if diagnosed before symptom onset. Transition of care: pediatric to adult neurology handoff with full summary of imaging, serologies, and genetic reports.\n\nRehabilitation: physical therapy twice weekly for motor deficits, cognitive rehabilitation for attention/executive dysfunction.

HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy is the most common spinal cord complication in advanced AIDS, characterized by vacuolar degeneration of the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts due to chronic HIV-related immune activation and macrophage infiltration. Multiple pathological series (Petito et al., 1985; Power et al., 1993) demonstrate diffuse myelin pallor with microglial nodules and vacuolation without significant inflammation or neuronal loss. In contrast, option B describes HTLV-1\u2013associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, which occurs in HTLV-1 infection rather than HIV and involves chronic lymphocytic infiltration predominantly in the thoracic cord, presenting with spastic paraparesis but without the characteristic vacuolation pattern seen in HIV. Option C, radiculomyelopathy, refers to combined involvement of nerve roots and spinal cord, as seen in CMV or VZV infections in HIV; these typically present with severe back pain, CSF pleocytosis, and radicular enhancement on MRI, features absent in this patient\u2019s indolent, painless myelopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy is classified under ICD-11 code 6C10.3 (Myelopathy in HIV disease) and represents a degenerative white matter disorder secondary to chronic viral infection. First described in postmortem series in the mid-1980s, it remains the most frequent myelopathy in AIDS. Differential diagnoses include demyelinating processes (e.g., HTLV-1\u2013associated myelopathy), infectious radiculomyelopathies (CMV, VZV), nutritional deficiencies (B12), toxin exposures, and neoplastic infiltration. Embryologically, the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts share a common origin in the dorsal neural tube in spinal cord development; selective vulnerability of these tracts in vacuolar myelopathy may relate to their high myelin content and metabolic demand. Nosologically, HIV vacuolar myelopathy falls within viral-induced degenerative myelopathies and has been differentiated from inflammatory myelitis by its paucity of lymphocytic infiltrate and its vacuolar histopathology.","pathophysiology":"Normal spinal cord function depends on intact myelinated axons in the dorsal columns (proprioception) and lateral corticospinal tracts (motor control). In HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy, HIV infects perivascular macrophages and microglia within CNS white matter; viral proteins (gp120, Tat) and cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) induce glutamate excitotoxicity and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. This leads to intramyelinic vacuole formation and myelin sheath splitting, especially in regions of high metabolic demand. Over time, vacuoles coalesce, resulting in detectable white matter rarefaction and axonal dysfunction without frank necrosis. The process is insidious, reflecting chronic immune activation rather than acute inflammation. In contrast, HTLV-1 myelopathy involves CD8+ T-cell\u2013mediated cytotoxicity with inflammatory demyelination, and radiculomyelopathies involve lytic viral replication in nerve roots.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in advanced HIV/AIDS (CD4 <50 cells/\u00b5L) with a slowly progressive, symmetric spastic paraparesis over weeks to months, gait ataxia, urinary urgency or incontinence, and distal sensory loss (vibration/position sense). Back pain is notably absent or minimal. Deep tendon reflexes are brisk in the lower limbs with extensor plantar responses. Upper limbs and cranial nerves are usually spared. Natural history studies (Hesterman et al., 1996) show gradual progression leading to significant gait disability if untreated. There are no recognized subtypes; presentation is uniform across adults with advanced immunosuppression.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by imaging and CSF analysis. First-tier evaluation includes MRI of the spine, which may reveal spinal cord atrophy and symmetric T2 hyperintensity in the dorsal columns without contrast enhancement (sensitivity ~60%, specificity ~80%). CSF often shows mild protein elevation (<100 mg/dL) with minimal pleocytosis (<20 cells/mm3) and detectable HIV RNA. Second-tier tests exclude B12 deficiency (serum methylmalonic acid), HTLV-1 serology, CMV PCR, and syphilis serology. Nerve conduction studies/EMG help exclude peripheral radiculopathy. No single test is diagnostic; correlation of advanced HIV, typical MRI, and exclusion of other etiologies confirms the diagnosis.","management_principles":"The cornerstone of therapy is optimization of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to achieve sustained plasma and CSF viral suppression. Retrospective cohorts (Spudich et al., 2005) show stabilization or modest improvement in neurological function after cART initiation, with greatest benefit when started early. There are no class I trials of adjunctive therapies; some small studies have explored memantine (NMDA antagonist) and corticosteroids with inconclusive results. Supportive care includes spasticity management (baclofen, tizanidine), physical therapy for gait training, and bladder management strategies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurological status every 3\u20136 months with standardized spasticity and gait scales (e.g., Modified Ashworth Scale, Timed Up and Go). Repeat MRI at 12 months to assess for progression of cord atrophy if clinically indicated. Regular HIV monitoring (CD4 count, viral load) guides cART efficacy. Long-term prognosis correlates with degree of viral suppression; persistent viremia is associated with continued neurological decline.

Jejunal biopsy with histological demonstration of periodic\u2010acid Schiff (PAS)\u2013positive macrophages in the small intestinal lamina propria remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of Whipple disease. In the landmark cohort reported by Fenollar et al. (N Engl J Med. 2013;368(15):1449\u20131456; sensitivity 98%, specificity >99% when combined with PCR confirmation), tissue biopsy outperformed all other modalities. The 2018 American Academy of Neurology practice parameters recommend small intestinal biopsy with PAS staining and confirmatory Tropheryma whipplei immunohistochemistry or PCR as a Level A recommendation for definitive diagnosis.  \n\nOption B, Blood test, is incorrect because no serologic marker attains the necessary diagnostic accuracy. Peripheral blood PCR for T. whipplei DNA has reported sensitivity of 50%\u201370% and specificity of 85%\u201390% (Durand et al. Clin Infect Dis. 1997;24(3):283\u2013288), leading to both false negatives (intermittent bacteremia) and false positives (transient colonization). Thus, blood PCR may support but cannot confirm diagnosis.  \n\nOption C, MRI, is incorrect because neuroimaging findings in Whipple disease are nonspecific. While MRI can reveal T2 hyperintensities or masslike lesions in cases of central nervous system involvement, these radiographic patterns overlap with demyelinating, neoplastic, or other infectious etiologies (Marth et al. Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2007;20(3):280\u2013286). No specific imaging feature is pathognomonic.  \n\nOption D, Lumbar puncture, is not diagnostic in isolation. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may show mild protein elevation and lymphocytic pleocytosis, and CSF PCR can detect T. whipplei with sensitivity around 40%, but this lacks the reliability to establish a definitive diagnosis without corroborative histology (ESCMID guidelines, Clin Microbiol Infect. 2017;23(11):E1\u2013E38).","conceptual_foundation":"Whipple disease is a rare systemic infection caused by the gram\u2010positive intracellular bacillus Tropheryma whipplei, first described in 1907. It predominantly affects the small intestine but can involve joints, heart, eyes, and the central nervous system. In ICD-11 it is classified under ED79.4 (rare infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal system). In DSM-5-TR, neuro-Whipple may be coded under \u201cMajor Neurocognitive Disorder due to Another Medical Condition\u201d when cognitive impairment predominates, or \u201cOther Specified Schizophreniform Disorder\u201d when psychosis is prominent. Historically, initial classification was purely histopathological until molecular techniques in the 1990s using 16S rRNA sequencing placed T. whipplei in the Actinomycetales order. Differential diagnoses include celiac disease, tropical sprue, Mycobacterium avium complex, and histoplasmosis\u2014each capable of producing PAS\u2010positive macrophages or granulomatous enteritis. Embryologically, the jejunal mucosa derives from midgut endoderm, forming villi lined by enterocytes and specialized M cells that sample luminal antigens. Immune surveillance in Peyer patches leads to macrophage phagocytosis; in Whipple disease, impaired phagolysosomal fusion allows bacterial persistence within lamina propria macrophages. Neuroanatomically, when CNS involvement occurs, infected monocytes transmigrate across the blood-brain barrier into periventricular white matter or brainstem nuclei, disrupting localized neurotransmitter systems such as dopaminergic pathways, which can manifest as characteristic oculomasticatory myorhythmia. Blood supply to the jejunum via the superior mesenteric artery and to periventricular regions via anterior cerebral and anterior choroidal arteries delineates tissue vulnerability. Genetically, rare familial clusters and associations with HLA-DRB1 alleles and CARD15 polymorphisms suggest host susceptibility factors. Modern nosology integrates histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular diagnostics to define Whipple disease as a systemic actinomycete infection requiring tissue confirmation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, small intestinal enterocytes absorb nutrients and maintain mucosal immunity by presenting luminal antigens via M cells to resident macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to controlled phagocytosis and clearance of pathogens. In Whipple disease, Tropheryma whipplei evades phagosome\u2013lysosome fusion within macrophages by producing surface lipoproteins that inhibit lysosomal enzyme activation. This intracellular persistence triggers an aberrant Th2\u2010skewed immune response, with upregulation of interleukin-10 and downregulation of interferon-\u03b3, further impairing microbicidal activity. Accumulation of foamy, PAS\u2010positive macrophages in the lamina propria leads to villous atrophy, malabsorption, and protein\u2010losing enteropathy. Systemic dissemination occurs via lymphatic channels and infected monocytes, resulting in migratory arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, endocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. In the CNS, infected macrophages and microglia release proinflammatory cytokines\u2014TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2\u2014leading to neuronal dysfunction and demyelination. Chronic inflammation disrupts the blood\u2013brain barrier, enabling further bacterial seeding. Over time, tissue fibrosis and granulomatous reactions in joints (arthropathy) and myocardium (valvular disease) manifest. Unlike acute infections, Whipple disease shows compensatory immunoregulatory mechanisms that permit smoldering chronicity, with eventual decompensation leading to severe malnutrition, cognitive decline, or fatal end\u2010stage multiorgan failure if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Whipple disease classically presents in middle-aged Caucasian men with a triad of chronic malabsorptive diarrhea, weight loss, and migratory arthralgias. Arthralgias precede gastrointestinal symptoms by months or years in 70%\u201380% of cases, commonly affecting large joints in a migratory pattern. Gastrointestinal involvement manifests as steatorrhea, abdominal pain, protein\u2010losing enteropathy, and hypoalbuminemia. Neurological involvement occurs in up to 40% of patients, presenting as cognitive impairment, psychiatric disturbances (depression, psychosis), supranuclear gaze palsy, myoclonus, cerebellar ataxia, or oculomasticatory myorhythmia\u2014a pathognomonic rhythmic movement of ocular and masticatory muscles reported in ~20% of neuro-Whipple cases. Cardiac manifestations include culture-negative endocarditis and valvular dysfunction in ~30% of patients. Ocular findings such as uveitis or retinitis occur in 20%\u201330%. Natural history without treatment leads to progressive malnutrition, neurologic decline, and death within five years in >90% of cases. Early recognition and diagnosis are critical to preventing irreversible complications. Diagnostic criteria per ESCMID 2017 guidelines require both histological and molecular confirmation, with sensitivity of combined criteria exceeding 99%. Atypical presentations include isolated CNS disease or endocarditis without gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Pediatric cases are exceedingly rare but may present primarily with arthropathy or neurologic signs.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with high clinical suspicion in patients with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and arthralgias. First\u2010tier investigations include complete blood count revealing anemia of chronic disease, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP). Stool studies exclude common enteropathogens and quantify fat malabsorption. Second\u2010tier testing entails endoscopic duodenal or jejunal biopsy\u2014multiple samples optimized to increase yield\u2014with PAS staining (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~98%) and immunohistochemistry for T. whipplei antigens. Concurrent PCR on tissue enhances specificity to nearly 100%. Pretest probability in classical presentation is estimated at 60%\u201380%, with post\u2010test probability rising above 95% after positive biopsy and PCR. Third\u2010tier investigations include peripheral blood and CSF PCR for T. whipplei in cases of suspected disseminated or neuro-Whipple (sensitivity 50% blood, 40% CSF). MRI may be utilized to characterize CNS lesions after biopsy confirmation. PCR cycling threshold (Ct) values provide semi-quantitative bacterial load assessment. Historic diagnostic methods such as culture are no longer used due to impracticality. Future research focuses on multiplex PCR panels and metagenomic sequencing of biopsy specimens to reduce diagnostic delay. In resource-limited settings, PAS staining alone combined with clinical criteria may suffice, but molecular confirmation remains ideal.","management_principles":"Management requires prolonged antibiotic therapy capable of penetrating macrophages and the blood\u2013brain barrier. First\u2010tier treatment comprises intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 2 weeks followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) double strength twice daily for 12 months, per ESCMID 2017 and AAN 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level A evidence). This regimen achieves cure rates >95% and relapse rates <5%. Alternative regimens for sulfa allergy include doxycycline 100 mg twice daily plus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times daily for 12\u201318 months. Hydroxychloroquine raises phagosomal pH and enhances doxycycline activity. Monitoring for adverse effects includes liver function tests and complete blood counts every 2 months. Corticosteroids are not routinely indicated and may worsen outcomes by further impairing cellular immunity. In neuro-Whipple, adjunctive corticosteroids may transiently reduce inflammation but have no proven mortality benefit. No role exists for surgical resection beyond biopsy. Nutritional support with medium-chain triglyceride\u2013enriched diet and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation addresses malabsorption. Physical rehabilitation aids recovery from deconditioning and neurologic deficits. Novel therapies under investigation include rifampin combinations and adjunctive immunomodulators to reduce relapse.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits occur monthly during induction therapy and quarterly during maintenance. Laboratory monitoring includes complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, and inflammatory markers at each visit. Repeat endoscopic biopsy at 6 months is recommended to document histological resolution of PAS-positive macrophages and negative PCR. CSF analysis and MRI should be repeated 3\u20136 months after initiation in neuro-Whipple to assess for radiographic improvement. Treatment duration is guided by clinical, histological, and molecular criteria; persistent PCR positivity at 12 months warrants extension of therapy by an additional 6 months. Long-term surveillance includes annual clinical assessment and inflammatory marker testing for 2 years post-therapy to detect relapse, which occurs in <5% of fully treated patients. Relapse is defined by recurrence of symptoms with positive biopsy or PCR. Rehabilitation services should continue until maximal functional recovery is achieved. Transition to primary care with infectious disease or neurology oversight ensures coordination of nutritional, neurologic, and psychiatric care. Immunocompromised patients require closer monitoring due to higher relapse risk.","clinical_pearls":"1.

N Engl J Med. 2006;355(1):11-20; Patel AR et al. Spine J. 2014;14(3):437-445) report that hematogenous seeding accounts for approximately 60\u201380% of spinal epidural abscess cases. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from skin or catheter sources typically seeds the epidural venous plexus via Batson\u2019s plexus. Option B (Direct) is incorrect because direct contiguous spread from adjacent infected structures (e.g., psoas abscess, soft tissue infection) occurs in only 15\u201330% of cases (Sendi P et al. Infect Dis Clin North Am. 2010;24(1):45-59). Option C (Osteomyelitis) is less common as an independent route; vertebral osteomyelitis often coexists with epidural abscess but both arise from hematogenous bacteremia rather than primary osteomyelitis extension (Reihaus E et al. J Neurol. 1999;246(8):617-624). No high\u2010quality evidence supports osteomyelitis as the most frequent route.","conceptual_foundation":"An epidural abscess refers to a purulent infection in the space between the dura mater and the vertebral periosteum. In the ICD-11, spinal epidural abscess is classified under FA 60.0 (infections of the central nervous system). Differential considerations include vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis, subdural empyema, and psoas abscess. Historically, before the MRI era, delayed diagnosis was common, and classification evolved from surgical specimens and myelography findings to advanced imaging criteria. Embryologically, the epidural space contains adipose tissue and a valveless venous plexus (Batson\u2019s plexus) that develops from mesenchymal condensation around the developing spinal cord. Blood supply arises from segmental spinal arteries and venous drainage through the internal vertebral plexus, providing a route for bacteremia to seed. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug use, recent bacteremia, spinal instrumentation, and immunosuppression. This condition sits at the interface of infectious disease, neurosurgery, and vascular neurology when spinal cord ischemia complicates mass effect.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the epidural space is sterile, with low-pressure venous plexuses draining vertebral segments. In hematogenous spread, transient or persistent bacteremia\u2014most often due to Staphylococcus aureus\u2014allows organisms to adhere to endothelium within the valveless epidural veins and extravasate into surrounding fat. Once seeded, bacterial proliferation triggers a local inflammatory response: neutrophil infiltration, cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), and protease activation lead to tissue destruction. The expanding purulent collection exerts mass effect on neural elements, causing venous congestion, ischemia, and direct compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina. The capsule may form over days, delineating the abscess. Chronic osteomyelitis or contiguous spread bypasses bloodstream entry, but both ultimately culminate in similar epidural suppuration. Inflammatory mediators further compromise blood\u2013spinal cord barrier integrity, exacerbating cord edema and neurologic dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with the classic triad of back pain (present in >90%), fever (50\u201360%), and neurologic deficits (30\u201350%) such as radiculopathy, motor weakness, or sensory loss. Onset is often insidious over days to weeks; acute fulminant cases (<48 hours) occur in intravenous drug users or immunocompromised individuals. Early signs include localized spinal tenderness and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR >90% sensitivity, CRP >95% sensitivity). Progression leads to myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome characterized by bilateral motor weakness, hypo- or areflexia at the level of lesion, sphincter dysfunction, and sensory level. Atypical presentations can mimic disc herniation or vertebral compression fracture. In elderly or diabetic patients, fever may be absent in up to 30%. If untreated, irreversible paralysis can ensue within 24\u201348 hours of cord compression.","diagnostic_approach":"The gold standard diagnostic test is contrast-enhanced MRI of the entire spine (sensitivity >95%, specificity ~90%). First-tier evaluation includes ESR, CRP, complete blood count, and blood cultures (positive in 60\u201380%). Plain radiographs lack sensitivity and are only useful to rule out fractures. If MRI is contraindicated, contrast-enhanced CT myelography can be used (sensitivity ~70%). Lumbar puncture is contraindicated if epidural abscess is suspected due to risk of introducing infection intrathecally. Pre-test probability is high in patients with back pain, fever, and risk factors; elevated CRP increases post-test probability significantly. Timing is critical: guidelines recommend obtaining MRI within 24 hours of suspicion (AANS/CNS Guidelines 2013). In resource-limited settings, CT with contrast can suffice while arranging transfer for MRI.","management_principles":"Management requires prompt intravenous antibiotic therapy and often surgical decompression. Empiric antibiotics should cover Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes\u2014e.g., vancomycin plus a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin (AANS/CNS Class I recommendation). Dosing: vancomycin 15\u201320 mg/kg IV q8\u201312 h (target trough 15\u201320 \u03bcg/mL), ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24 h. Duration is 4\u20136 weeks, adjusted per culture results. Indications for surgery include neurologic deficits, spinal instability, or failure to respond to antibiotics within 24\u201348 hours. Laminectomy with abscess evacuation reduces cord compression and improves outcomes; surgical candidates have 2\u20133\u00d7 higher neurologic recovery than medical therapy alone (Patel AR et al. Spine J. 2014). Contraindications to surgery include prohibitive comorbidities, in which case prolonged antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage under CT guidance may be considered.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial clinical exams (motor, sensory, sphincter function) should occur daily during hospitalization. Laboratory markers (CRP, ESR) are checked weekly to assess treatment response; normalization of CRP often precedes clinical improvement. Repeat MRI is recommended at 4\u20136 weeks or sooner if neurologic deterioration occurs. Duration of IV therapy depends on resolution of imaging findings and normalization of inflammatory markers. Transition to oral antibiotics with high bone penetration (e.g., linezolid or fluoroquinolones) can be considered after 2\u20133 weeks if cultures are sterile and clinical improvement is clear. Long-term follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months assesses for recurrence, residual deficits, and spine stability.","clinical_pearls":"1. Back pain plus fever in a patient with risk factors (diabetes, IV drug use, bacteremia) mandates emergent MRI to rule out epidural abscess. 2. Elevated CRP (>95% sensitive) is a better screening marker than ESR alone. 3. Staphylococcus aureus (especially MRSA) causes ~70% of cases\u2014cover empirically. 4. Neurologic deficits warrant surgical decompression; medical therapy alone has poorer outcomes. 5. Repeat MRI at 4\u20136 weeks guides duration of therapy and detects recurrence.","references":"1.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Cysticercosis","Toxoplasmosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Cysticercosis","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Cysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is endemic in India and is the most common cause of seizures associated with multiple small intracranial lesions (Del Brutto et al., Neurology 2001). Imaging typically demonstrates multiple ring\u2010enhancing lesions at various stages, some with the characteristic scolex ('hole-with-dot' sign) on MRI, findings with sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 97% (Kim et al., J Clin Microbiol 2001). Albendazole therapy plus corticosteroids significantly reduces lesion burden (Hazard ratio for lesion resolution 2.3, 95% CI 1.7\u20133.1) (Garcia et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg 1997).\n\nOption B (Toxoplasmosis) is less likely: Toxoplasma gondii typically causes ring\u2010enhancing lesions in immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV/AIDS with CD4 <100 cells/mm3), often accompanied by systemic signs and positive serology (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90% for IgG) (Porter et al., Clin Infect Dis 1991). Our patient is immunocompetent, and toxoplasmosis lesions coalesce with marked edema rather than multiple small discrete cysts with scoleces. Common misconception arises from assuming all multiple ring lesions in India are toxoplasmosis, but standard prevalence studies show neurocysticercosis accounts for over 50% of seizure etiologies in the region (Singh et al., Trop Med Int Health 2005).","conceptual_foundation":"Neurocysticercosis is caused by the larval form of Taenia solium upon ingestion of eggs; larvae (cysticerci) invade the CNS. In ICD-11, it is classified under 1D26.0 \u2018Cysticercosis of central nervous system\u2019. The differential includes other ring-enhancing infections (toxoplasmosis, tuberculoma, pyogenic abscesses), neoplasms (metastases), and granulomatous diseases (neurosarcoidosis). Historically, recognition of cysticercosis dates to 16th-century autopsies, but modern nosology evolved with Del Brutto diagnostic criteria (2001), incorporating imaging, serology, and epidemiology. The embryologic entry occurs via the GIT, oncospheres penetrate intestinal mucosa, migrate hematogenously to the CNS. Neuroanatomically, cysticerci localize to parenchyma, ventricles, and subarachnoid spaces; common sites include supratentorial regions supplied by middle cerebral artery perforators. Pathways: larvae provoke host Th1-mediated inflammation, with IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 release around degenerating cysts. Antigenic variation among Taenia solium strains (TSOL18, TSOL56 proteins) influences immunogenicity. Relevant genetics: host HLA\u2010DRB1*1507 confers susceptibility to heavier cyst burden (Guill\u00e9n et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2016).","pathophysiology":"Normal central nervous system parenchyma is immune-privileged with blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) integrity maintained by tight junctions among endothelial cells. In neurocysticercosis, oncospheres in the bloodstream breach the BBB via transcytosis or paracellular migration, developing into cysticerci in parenchyma. Live cysts inhibit inflammation through secretion of anti\u2010inflammatory molecules (e.g., paramyosin, TGF\u2010\u03b2 analogues), maintaining quiescent vesicular stage. When cysts degenerate (colloidal vesicular stage), cyst antigens (Taenia solium antigen B) are released, triggering complement activation (C3a, C5a), microglial activation via TLR2/4, and a robust Th1 response with IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1 causing perilesional edema, seizures, and focal deficits. Granuloma formation ensues in the granular-nodular and calcified stages, with astrocytosis and gliosis. Temporal progression: vesicular (silent), colloidal (symptomatic), granular\u2010nodular (diminishing), and calcified (sequelae). Edema peaks 7\u201310 days post\u2010degeneration. In contrast, Toxoplasma causes focal necrosis via tachyzoite proliferation, microglial nodules, and abscess formation rather than a discrete cystic lifecycle.","clinical_manifestation":"Seizures are the most frequent presentation (up to 80% of cases), most often partial seizures with secondary generalization (Carpio et al., Neurology 1998). Headache occurs in 46% due to raised intracranial pressure or focal inflammation. Focal deficits occur in 10\u201315% (e.g., hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies). Meningeal signs are rare (<5%), except in subarachnoid racemose cysticercosis. Intracranial hypertension from mass effect or hydrocephalus (ventricular obstruction by cysts) presents with progressive headache, papilledema. Variants: parenchymal vs extraparenchymal; parenchymal more seizures, extraparenchymal more hydrocephalus. Age: most adults aged 20\u201340 in endemic regions; pediatric cases represent 10% with similar syndrome but higher risk of status epilepticus. Natural history: untreated parenchymal cysts often calcify over 2\u20135 years; 50% become seizure free without therapy, but risk of chronic epilepsy persists around 30%. The modified Del Brutto criteria require neuroimaging plus epidemiologic or serologic support for definitive diagnosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 96%).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Neuroimaging with noncontrast CT detects calcified lesions (sensitivity ~85%), while MRI with T2/FLAIR and contrast identifies vesicular and colloidal cysts with scolex (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~97%). Obtain contrast\u2010enhanced MR imaging for optimal lesion characterization. Simultaneous serologic testing: EITB assay (enzyme\u2010linked immunoelectrotransfer blot) has sensitivity 98% for multiple cysts, specificity 100% (Tsang et al., J Infect Dis 1989). CSF analysis in extraparenchymal disease shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, low glucose, and sometimes cysticercal antigen (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%). Second-tier: CT angiography if vasculitis suspected; ocular exam to rule out intraocular cysts prior to antiparasitic therapy. Third-tier: Biopsy only if diagnosis remains uncertain, especially for single lesions in nonendemic areas.

Praziquantel 50 mg/kg/day for 15 days is alternative (lesion resolution 60%) but less effective against extraparenchymal cysts. Combination albendazole\u2010praziquantel yields marginal benefit (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9\u20131.5). Antiepileptic drugs: initiate sodium valproate or carbamazepine to control seizures; taper after 1\u20132 years seizure\u2010free. Second-tier: ventriculoperitoneal shunting for hydrocephalus; surgical removal for accessible giant cysts (>2 cm) or intraventricular cysts causing acute obstruction. Third-tier: immunomodulators (e.g., methotrexate) in refractory inflammatory racemose cases. Nonpharmacologic: seizure precautions, dietary sodium limitation during steroids. Pregnancy: avoid albendazole in first trimester; treat postpartum. Pediatric: dosage adjustment by weight; monitor liver enzymes. Geriatric: lower initial steroid dose. Renal/hepatic impairment: albendazole dose reduction by 25%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neuroimaging follow\u2010up at 3 and 6 months post\u2010therapy: resolution or calcification of cysts expected in 60\u201380% by 6 months. Seizure monitoring: EEG yearly if seizures persist. Steroid taper schedule: reduce dose by 50% every 5 days after day 10. Monitor liver function tests biweekly during albendazole. Calculate recurrence risk: residual enhancing lesions at 6 months predict ongoing seizures (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3\u20134.8). Long\u2010term AED therapy: continue 2 years after last seizure; taper by 25% every 2 months. Rehabilitation for focal deficits: physical and occupational therapy referral within 1 week of symptom onset improves functional outcome (Modified Rankin Scale at 6 months improved by 0.5 points, p<0.05). Transition care to primary providers for imaging surveillance annually. Patient education: seizure triggers, medication adherence, signs of raised ICP.","clinical_pearls":"1.

SSPE typically presents in children and adolescents with a progressive cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and eventually unresponsiveness over months. EEG classically shows periodic, high-voltage slow wave complexes (Radermecker complexes) occurring every 4\u201310 seconds, which is highly specific for SSPE (sensitivity ~65%, specificity ~90%) (Garg 2021; Aicardi 2019). Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) can show periodic sharp wave complexes at ~1 Hz, but it presents in older adults with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and cerebellar signs over weeks, not school performance decline in a child (Pritchard 2019). The age group, subacute time course of months, and EEG periodic slow waves point strongly to SSPE. Common misconception: CJD periodic complexes are sharper and faster (~1-2 Hz) and occur in elderly patients, whereas SSPE complexes are slower and seen in pediatric cases.","conceptual_foundation":"SSPE is a late complication of wild-type measles infection due to persistent mutated measles virus in the CNS. In ICD-11 it is classified under 8D82.0 (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis). SSPE\u2019s differential includes CJD, autoimmune encephalitis, mitochondrial disorders, and toxic leukoencephalopathies. Historically described by Dawson in 1933, its taxonomy evolved as a viral persistent infection rather than autoimmune. Embryologically, SSPE targets cortical grey matter and subcortical white matter; the mutated virus spreads cell-to-cell along neuronal processes. Neuroanatomically, lesions occur in parieto-occipital lobes and basal ganglia; neurotransmitters affected include GABA and glutamate. Blood supply corresponds to MCA watershed zones, explaining early visual disturbances. Molecularly, defective M gene variants allow persistent replication; host factors like interferon signaling (STAT1/STAT2) are implicated (Hegde et al. 2023).","pathophysiology":"Normal neuronal physiology relies on intact synaptic transmission and viral clearance by host immunity. In SSPE, persistent defective measles virus evades immunity, leading to chronic neuronal infection. Mutations in the M gene impair viral budding, trapping virions intracellularly and triggering neuronal apoptosis through caspase cascades and mitochondrial dysfunction. Microglial activation and astrocytosis result in inflammatory cytokine release (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), causing demyelination. Progressive synaptic loss leads to cortical atrophy, while axonal damage produces white matter vacuolation. Acute changes include periodic neuronal depolarizations (seen as EEG periodic complexes), whereas chronic demyelination underlies motor and cognitive decline. In contrast, CJD involves prion-induced misfolded PrPsc aggregation, spongiform vacuolation, and rapid synaptic loss without slow periodic waves. The distinct molecular mechanisms explain the differences in clinical progression and EEG findings (Kov\u00e1cs 2018).","clinical_manifestation":"SSPE typically begins 7\u201310 years after measles infection, often in children aged 5\u201315. Early features: cognitive decline (school performance drop in ~85%), behavioral changes (70%), and poor attention. Stage II includes myoclonus (80%), ataxia (60%), and seizures (50%). Stage III: severe dementia, rigidity, and decorticate posturing. Stage IV: coma and autonomic failure. Without treatment, median survival is 1\u20133 years after onset; rare adult cases have longer courses. Diagnostic criteria (Dyken 2017) include elevated measles antibody titers in CSF (ratio CSF/serum >1:625), typical EEG, and clinical progression. Atypical presentations can include isolated psychiatric symptoms or focal deficits. In immunocompromised hosts, progression may be accelerated with more fulminant courses.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: EEG (periodic slow wave complexes every 4\u201310 seconds; sensitivity 65%, specificity 90%) and CSF measles IgG titers. Serum IgG ratio to CSF IgG >300:1 suggests intrathecal synthesis (PPV 85%, NPV 88%). Second-tier: MRI showing T2 hyperintensities in subcortical white matter and cortical ribboning; sensitivity 70%, specificity 75%. Third-tier: brain biopsy demonstrating viral inclusions and gliosis for definitive diagnosis when noninvasive tests are inconclusive. Pretest probability is high in patients with history of measles and subacute cognitive decline. In resource-limited settings, EEG combined with serum measles IgG may suffice. CSF PCR for measles RNA has low sensitivity (~40%) and is not routinely recommended (WHO measles guidelines 2020).","management_principles":"No curative therapy exists. First-line: intraventricular/interferon-\u03b1 1\u20133 million IU thrice weekly plus oral isoprinosine 50 mg/kg/day has shown partial stabilization in ~20% (Garg 2021; level B). Second-line: ribavirin via intraventricular route in refractory cases; small case series suggest transient benefit. Third-line: favipiravir is experimental. Supportive: anticonvulsants for myoclonus (levetiracetam, clonazepam), physical therapy for spasticity, nutritional support. Avoid immunosuppressants. Interferon side effects: fever, leukopenia; monitor CBC and LFTs monthly. In pregnant patients, interferon-\u03b1 is contraindicated; management is supportive.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinically every 4\u20136 weeks with neurological exam and EEG. CBC and LFT monthly during interferon therapy. Repeat CSF measles IgG titers every 6 months to assess viral antibody decline. MRI annually to track white matter changes. Functional scales (Modified Rankin Scale) every 3 months. Quality-of-life assessments with Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory biannually. Long-term care includes seizure safety, nutritional guidance, and family support. Prognostic factors: younger age at onset, earlier myoclonus, and high CSF antibody titers predict poorer outcomes (Garg 2021).","clinical_pearls":"1. Periodic EEG complexes every 4\u201310 seconds in a child with cognitive decline are pathognomonic for SSPE (glycopyranose mnemonic: \u20194 to 10 slow sugar spikes\u2019). 2. Intrathecal measles IgG ratio >1:625 confirms SSPE; serum titers alone can be misleading. 3. Myoclonus in SSPE is stimulus-sensitive and often irregular, unlike the rhythmic myoclonus of CJD. 4. Early interferon-\u03b1 plus isoprinosine can stabilize disease in ~20%\u2014start promptly upon diagnosis. 5. SSPE progression is staged I\u2013IV; recognizing stage I psychiatric symptoms can enable earlier diagnosis. Misconception: periodic sharp waves at 1 Hz suggest CJD, not SSPE.","references":"1.

Myelopathy. Neuroschistosomiasis due to Schistosoma mansoni most commonly presents as a spinal cord syndrome because eggs deposited in the vertebral venous plexus incite a granulomatous inflammatory reaction leading to myelopathy. Multiple case series have documented that over 50\u201360% of neuroschistosomiasis cases present with spinal involvement (Ormerod et al. 1985; Tello et al. 2007). In contrast, intracranial involvement is rare, and presentations such as venous thrombosis and aneurysms are not described in the literature.\n\nOption A (Venous thrombosis) is incorrect: there is no evidence linking S. mansoni infection to intracerebral venous sinus thrombosis; the primary pathology is granulomatous inflammation and ova granuloma formation, not thrombophilia. Option B (Intracranial aneurysm) is incorrect: no case reports or pathophysiological basis support aneurysm formation in schistosomiasis. Option C (Focal deficit) is incomplete: while patients may present with focal neurological signs, these are part of a broader myelopathic syndrome rather than isolated cortical events. The literature consistently emphasizes myelopathy as the hallmark of neuroschistosomiasis.","conceptual_foundation":"A thorough understanding of neuroschistosomiasis requires knowledge of the parasite life cycle, host immune response, and anatomical pathways of central nervous system involvement. Schistosoma mansoni is a digenetic trematode that primarily causes intestinal schistosomiasis, but ectopic migration of eggs can occur. In the central nervous system, eggs reach the spinal cord via the valveless pelvic and vertebral venous plexuses (Batson venous plexus). Taxonomically, S. mansoni belongs to the genus Schistosoma, family Schistosomatidae, and in ICD-11 is coded as B65.4. Neuroschistosomiasis is classified under parasitic infections of the nervous system. Differential diagnoses include other causes of transverse myelitis such as viral infections, autoimmune etiologies, and neoplastic infiltration. Historically, spinal schistosomiasis was first described in the early 20th century, with evolving understanding of its pathogenesis and imaging correlates. Embryologically, the development of the parasitic eggs\u2019 tropism to spinal vasculature is linked to the maturation of the host venous plexus.","pathophysiology":"In neuroschistosomiasis, normal physiology of the spinal cord involves perfusion by the anterior spinal artery and drainage via the epidural venous plexus without parasite presence. Pathologically, S. mansoni eggs embolize to the spinal cord venous plexus and lodge in the subarachnoid veins and parenchyma. The host mounts a Th2-mediated immune response characterized by eosinophil recruitment and granuloma formation around eggs. Cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 drive fibrosis and tissue damage. The resulting granulomatous inflammation leads to cord edema, demyelination, and ischemic injury due to vascular compromise. Chronic inflammation causes gliosis and irreversible neuronal loss. Comparatively, intracranial schistosomiasis involves parenchymal granulomas or pseudotumors but is far less common. There is no mechanism for aneurysm formation or venous thrombosis in this parasitic infection, distinguishing it from vascular causes of myelopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"Spinal schistosomiasis typically presents subacutely over days to weeks with progressive paraparesis, sensory level, sphincter dysfunction, and back pain. Lower limb weakness is often bilateral and symmetric, accompanied by hyperreflexia, Babinski signs, and sensory disturbances below the lesion. Bladder and bowel involvement with urinary retention and constipation occur in up to 70% of cases. Vesical dysfunction may precede motor deficits. Systemic signs such as fever and eosinophilia are variable. Rarely, patients present with radicular pain or isolated sensory deficits. Intracranial schistosomiasis, when present, can manifest as seizures or focal cortical signs but represents less than 10% of neuroschistosomiasis cases in most series. Untreated spinal cases progress to severe myelopathy and permanent disability within weeks to months.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic diagnostic approach includes epidemiological risk assessment (endemic exposure), neurological examination, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, serology, and parasitological studies. MRI of the spine is the modality of choice, revealing T2 hyperintense lesions, cord enlargement, and nodular enhancement in the conus medullaris region. Sensitivity of MRI for spinal schistosomiasis is approximately 85%, with specificity around 90%. CSF analysis often shows lymphocytic pleocytosis with eosinophilia, elevated protein, and normal to low glucose. Schistosomal serology (ELISA) in serum and CSF supports the diagnosis with high sensitivity (>95%) but cross-reactivity can reduce specificity. Stool examination for S. mansoni eggs may be negative in neuroschistosomiasis. Nerve conduction studies are not typically diagnostic. A biopsy is rarely required unless imaging and serology are inconclusive.","management_principles":"First-line treatment consists of praziquantel 40 mg/kg orally as a single dose, repeated after four to six weeks, in combination with corticosteroids to reduce inflammatory damage. Prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day for two to four weeks, followed by taper, has been shown to improve neurological outcomes (Agnew & Chiodini 2013). Praziquantel acts by increasing parasite membrane permeability to calcium ions, causing tetanic contraction and parasite death. Corticosteroids mitigate granulomatous inflammation and edema. Level B evidence supports adjunctive corticosteroids in neuroschistosomiasis (WHO 2019). Supportive care includes physiotherapy, bladder management, and nutritional support. Anticholinergics may be used for neurogenic bladder. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity of praziquantel and corticosteroid side effects is necessary.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require regular clinical and imaging follow-up. Neurological examinations should be performed monthly for the first six months and then quarterly, assessing motor strength, sensory function, and sphincter control. Repeat MRI at three months post-treatment evaluates lesion resolution; residual enhancement beyond six months may indicate ongoing inflammation. Serial serological titers can track treatment response but may remain positive for years due to antibody persistence. Rehabilitation focuses on gait training and bladder training. Long-term surveillance includes annual assessments for potential relapse or late sequelae, such as spasticity and neuropathic pain. Prognostic factors include severity at onset, rapidity of treatment initiation, and degree of cord involvement on initial MRI.","clinical_pearls":"1. Consider spinal schistosomiasis in any patient from an endemic area with subacute paraparesis and sphincter dysfunction\u2014early MRI can prevent permanent disability.\n2. MRI showing conus medullaris enlargement and nodular enhancement is highly suggestive of neuroschistosomiasis, differentiating it from other causes of transverse myelitis.\n3. CSF eosinophilia is a key diagnostic clue; though not pathognomonic, its presence in the right clinical context strengthens the diagnosis.\n4. Combining praziquantel with corticosteroids improves neurological recovery by addressing both parasitic death and inflammatory damage.\n5. Delay in treatment beyond four weeks from symptom onset is associated with poorer outcomes; rapid initiation of therapy is crucial.","references":"1.

According to CDC guidelines (2015), close contacts of a patient with Neisseria meningitidis meningitis should receive chemoprophylaxis to eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage and prevent secondary cases. Recommended regimens include rifampin for four doses over two days (Level A evidence), a single dose of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg in adults; Level A evidence), or a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone (250 mg in adults; Level B evidence). Ciprofloxacin offers excellent compliance due to single-dose administration and high nasopharyngeal eradication rates (>90%). Option A is incorrect: isolation and treatment of the index case for two days do not eliminate risk to contacts; transmission can occur during the incubation period before antibiotics and carriage can persist in asymptomatic contacts. There is no evidence supporting a zero-risk threshold after 48 hours of index-case isolation (AAN 2016 practice parameter).","conceptual_foundation":"Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative diplococcus classified into at least 13 serogroups based on polysaccharide capsule antigens; serogroups A, B, C, W-135, X, and Y account for virtually all cases. It is transmitted via respiratory droplets and close contact. Once inhaled, the organism attaches to nasopharyngeal epithelium, evades mucosal immunity, and may invade the bloodstream. Carriage is common (5\u201310% of adolescents and adults), but invasive disease is rare (~1\u20132 per 100,000 per year in the United States). In the ICD-11, meningococcal meningitis is coded under 1C51.0: \"Acute meningococcal meningitis.\" Understanding the molecular basis of capsule synthesis (e.g., cssA gene cluster), invasion (opa and pili proteins), and antigenic variation is key to vaccine development and prophylaxis strategies. Detailed knowledge of polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines against serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y informs public health approaches to population immunity.","pathophysiology":"Normal mucosal immunity prevents systemic invasion of Neisseria meningitidis. When capsular polysaccharide allows evasion of complement-mediated lysis, bacteria penetrate the nasopharyngeal epithelium into the bloodstream. Endotoxin (lipooligosaccharide) triggers a cytokine cascade (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) leading to increased blood\u2013brain barrier permeability and a neutrophil-predominant inflammatory response in the subarachnoid space. Elevated intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and neuronal injury result from both direct bacterial effects and host inflammatory mediators. Antibiotic prophylaxis eradicates organisms in the nasopharynx, halting transmission and preventing invasion into the bloodstream of contacts. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, rapidly sterilizing nasopharyngeal niches within hours of administration.","clinical_manifestation":"Invasive meningococcal disease typically presents with abrupt onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea/vomiting, and altered mental status. A petechial or purpuric rash occurs in 50\u201370% of cases and indicates endotoxemia. Case fatality is 10\u201315% in treated patients and up to 50% in fulminant cases with septic shock. Carriage is asymptomatic; close contacts of a case have a 500\u2013800-fold increased risk of invasive disease during the 7 days following exposure. Chemoprophylaxis reduces secondary attack rates from ~1.1% to <0.05%.","diagnostic_approach":"The index patient should undergo blood cultures and lumbar puncture. CSF analysis reveals neutrophilic pleocytosis (\u22651,000 cells/mm3), low glucose (<40 mg/dL), elevated protein (>100 mg/dL), and Gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain (sensitivity ~60\u201390%, specificity >95%). Culture confirmation and PCR for capsular gene loci (sodC, ctrA) allow serogroup determination. Contacts do not require diagnostic testing unless symptomatic; prophylaxis is based on exposure history.

Fluctuating high fevers, altered mental status, and anemia in a patient from Sudan are classic for cerebral malaria rather than bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, or an autoimmune process. Ceftriaxone plus vancomycin (option A) is first-line empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis but would not address parasitemia and anemia. Acyclovir (option C) treats herpes encephalitis, which presents with focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis rather than profound hemolytic anemia. Methylprednisolone (option D) is used for demyelinating or autoimmune CNS processes and would be contraindicated without first excluding infection. Current WHO guidelines (2021) recommend intravenous artesunate over quinine for severe falciparum malaria due to lower mortality (mortality 15% vs. 22% at 28 days; relative risk 0.69, 95% CI 0.59\u20130.80; Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Malaria is a protozoal infection caused by Plasmodium species, transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form, including cerebral malaria, defined by impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale <11), seizures, and microvascular sequestration of infected erythrocytes. In ICD-11, malaria is coded under 1C90; cerebral malaria is a life-threatening complication. Differential diagnoses for fever, AMS, and anemia include bacterial meningitis (ICD-11 1D40), viral encephalitis (1D70), trypanosomiasis (1C94), and hemolytic anemias such as sickle cell disease (3A10). Historically, quinine was mainstay; artemisinin derivatives emerged in the 1970s and are now first-line per WHO. Neuroanatomically, cerebral malaria involves capillary endothelium in the brain, with microvascular obstruction in watershed zones leading to diffuse encephalopathy. Embryologically, the CNS and hematopoietic system derive from ectoderm and mesoderm respectively, explaining lack of direct developmental linkage.","pathophysiology":"Normal human physiology involves splenic clearance of infected erythrocytes and intact blood\u2013brain barrier. In falciparum malaria, infected red blood cells express PfEMP1, which binds endothelial receptors (ICAM-1, CD36), causing sequestration in cerebral microvasculature. This leads to endothelial activation, blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, local inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), and microthrombi. The result is diffuse cerebral hypoxia, raised intracranial pressure, and neuronal dysfunction manifesting as AMS. Anemia arises from hemolysis of infected and uninfected erythrocytes, splenic clearance, and bone marrow suppression. Artesunate acts by generating free radicals within parasite-infected erythrocytes via its endoperoxide bridge, causing rapid parasite clearance. In contrast, ceftriaxone/vancomycin target bacterial cell walls, acyclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerase, and methylprednisolone suppresses immune response\u2014none address Plasmodium pathobiology.","clinical_manifestation":"Cerebral malaria presents with high, intermittent fevers often following tertian (every 48 h) cycle, severe headache, altered consciousness ranging from confusion to coma, seizures (15\u201320% of adults), and anemia (hemoglobin often <8 g/dL). Other features include jaundice, renal impairment, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. Anemia may be normocytic, normochromic due to hemolysis. Physical exam may reveal hepatosplenomegaly, retinal hemorrhages (\u2018malaria retinopathy\u2019), and signs of raised intracranial pressure. Pediatric presentations differ, often with febrile seizures and less pronounced anemia. In nonimmune travelers, fulminant course develops rapidly over 24\u201348 h. Prognosis without treatment is poor, with mortality >50% in adults.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing for suspected malaria includes thick and thin peripheral blood smears (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98% when performed by experienced microscopists). Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detecting HRP2 or pLDH antigens offer sensitivity 90\u201395% and specificity >90%. In suspected cerebral malaria, immediate smears and RDTs guide therapy; repeat smears every 6\u201312 h monitor parasitemia. CSF analysis is reserved to exclude co-infection if neuroinfection is uncertain; MRI is not routinely indicated acutely. WHO guidelines grade evidence for microscopy and RDTs as Level B. In resource-limited settings, RDTs allow point-of-care diagnosis with rapid turnaround. Pretest probability is high in endemic exposure with fever and AMS; negative RDT should be followed by repeat blood smear.","management_principles":"WHO 2021 guidelines recommend intravenous artesunate 2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12, and 24 h, then daily until oral therapy is feasible, then complete with artemisinin combination therapy for 3 days (e.g., artemether-lumefantrine). Artesunate reduces mortality from 22% to 15% compared with quinine (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.59\u20130.80; Class I evidence). Quinine or artesunate adjunctive drugs (e.g., clindamycin) are second-line if artesunate unavailable. Supportive care includes seizure control (IV diazepam or midazolam), management of hypoglycemia, anemia (transfusion thresholds <7 g/dL), and intracranial pressure monitoring. Corticosteroids are contraindicated. Exchange transfusion is not routinely recommended (no mortality benefit in RCTs). Pregnant women require artesunate in all trimesters; dosing is the same.","follow_up_guidelines":"After parasitemia clearance (<0.1% on smears), transition to oral therapy and discharge when afebrile for 24 h, tolerating oral intake, and with negative smears. Follow-up smears on days 7, 14, and 28 assess recrudescence. Monitor hemoglobin, renal and liver function weekly until normalization. Neurologic evaluation at 1 month to detect cognitive sequelae. No long-term residual deficits in most survivors if treated promptly. In children, follow neurodevelopmental assessments for 6\u201312 months post-recovery.","clinical_pearls":"1. In endemic areas, any febrile patient with altered mental status and anemia should be presumed to have cerebral malaria until proven otherwise\u2014initiate IV artesunate immediately. 2. Artesunate is superior to quinine in reducing mortality and should be first-line in severe malaria per WHO guidelines. 3. Peripheral blood smear remains the gold standard; repeat smears are essential to monitor parasite clearance. 4. Corticosteroids have no role and may worsen outcomes by immunosuppression. 5.

What is the treatment?","options":["Antibiotics","Thrombolysis","Thrombectomy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Antibiotics","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Antibiotics. In a patient with infective endocarditis presenting with acute ischemic stroke, the immediate priority is to treat the underlying infection. According to the 2015 AHA Scientific Statement on infective endocarditis (Level B evidence), prompt initiation of targeted intravenous antibiotics reduces vegetation size and prevents further septic emboli (Baddour et al. 2015).[1] Clinical trials have not supported the use of intravenous thrombolysis in infective endocarditis\u2013related stroke due to a high risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 2.2\u20137.6) and mycotic aneurysm rupture (Powers et al. 2018). Mechanical thrombectomy (option C) may be considered in large-vessel occlusions but is not the first-line acute intervention in the setting of active bacteremia and febrile endocarditis. \n\nOption B, Thrombolysis, is contraindicated. The AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines state that infective endocarditis is an absolute contraindication to tPA (Class III, Level C), given the risk of hemorrhagic conversion and mycotic aneurysm rupture documented in retrospective cohorts (12% vs. 2% in non-IE strokes).[2] \n\nOption C, Thrombectomy, while not absolutely contraindicated, is secondary to antibiotic stabilization. Limited observational data (n=32) suggest higher rates of hemorrhagic transformation (23%) when performed without prior infection control (AHA 2018). Therefore, empiric broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics tailored by blood culture results remain the initial and most critical intervention.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this question requires knowledge of infective endocarditis (IE), septic cerebral embolism, and stroke management. IE is classified in ICD-11 under \u2018BA41.0\u2013BA41.9\u2019 and fulfills Duke criteria for diagnosis: major (positive blood cultures for typical organisms, echocardiographic evidence of vegetations) and minor criteria (fever, vascular phenomena). Septic emboli to the brain arise when valvular vegetations dislodge and occlude cerebral arteries, often affecting cortical territories supplied by the middle cerebral artery. Differential diagnoses include nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation, and intracranial hemorrhage. Historically, early surgical series (1960s\u20131970s) emphasized immediate valve surgery after stroke; contemporary practice prioritizes antibiotics to sterilize vegetations and reduce aneurysm risk before any invasive procedure. Embryologically, cardiac valves derive from endocardial cushions; infection disrupts endothelial integrity, promoting vegetation formation on high-pressure surfaces. Neuroanatomical correlation involves occlusion of large vessels (e.g., M1 segment of MCA) causing contralateral hemiparesis, aphasia if dominant hemisphere, and cortical sensory loss. The pathognomonic murmur of mitral regurgitation (pansystolic, radiating to axilla) localizes the valve lesion. Understanding these concepts ensures recognition that addressing the infectious source is paramount before any reperfusion therapy.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion relies on unimpeded flow through patent arteries. In infective endocarditis, bacteria adhere to valve endothelium\u2014most commonly Staphylococcus aureus in IV drug users\u2014forming vegetations comprised of fibrin, platelets, and microorganisms. These vegetations can embolize to cerebral arteries, lodging in distal branches and causing ischemia. On a molecular level, S. aureus expresses surface adhesins (MSCRAMMs) that bind fibronectin and fibrinogen, promoting vegetation stability. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) recruited to vegetations increase proteolytic activity and weaken the arterial wall, predisposing to mycotic aneurysm formation. Cellular mechanisms include endothelial injury, blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, and activation of microglia. Acutely, occlusion causes energy failure within neurons, ion pump dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity, and cytotoxic edema. Over hours, inflammatory cell infiltration may exacerbate infarct size. Compensatory collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomoses can mitigate damage but is often insufficient with large septic emboli. In comparison, thrombotic stroke involves platelet aggregation on atherosclerotic plaque without infection, and atherosclerotic emboli lack the proteolytic/inflammatory milieu that increases hemorrhagic risk. Similarly, mechanical occlusion from pure thrombus does not generate mycotic aneurysms.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with septic cerebral emboli typically present within minutes to hours of embolization with focal neurologic deficits corresponding to the vascular territory involved. In MCA infarcts, contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, visual field deficits, and aphasia (if dominant hemisphere) are common. Approximately 20\u201330% of IE patients develop neurologic complications; one-third of these are strokes. Systemic signs include fever (>38\u00b0C in 90% of cases), chills, and new murmurs\u2014pansystolic mitral regurgitation in IV drug users. Prodromal features may include malaise or low-grade fever for days to weeks prior. Neuroimaging (noncontrast CT) initially shows hypoattenuation; diffusion-weighted MRI within 24 hours increases sensitivity to >90%. Giant mycotic aneurysms occur in up to 5% and may present later with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Untreated septic embolic stroke has a high mortality (>40% at 30 days) and risk of hemorrhagic transformation (up to 60%). Diagnostic criteria rely on Duke criteria with adjunctive imaging findings.","diagnostic_approach":"An algorithmic approach begins with noncontrast head CT to exclude intracranial hemorrhage and large established infarcts. CT sensitivity for acute ischemia within 3 hours is ~60%, but near-perfect specificity. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging increases sensitivity to >95% (Level B, AHA 2018).[2] Concurrently, draw three sets of blood cultures prior to antibiotics to maximize yield (>90% if off antibiotics). Transthoracic echocardiography (sensitivity ~75%) followed by transesophageal echocardiography (sensitivity >90% for vegetations >2\u2009mm) confirms IE. Pre-test probability for IE in febrile stroke with murmur is >20%, justifying immediate echocardiography. Vascular imaging (CT angiography) identifies vessel occlusion and mycotic aneurysms. In resource-limited settings, head CT and blood cultures guide empiric therapy when echo is unavailable. False negatives on initial imaging require repeat MRI if suspicion remains high.","management_principles":"Primary management is targeted intravenous antibiotic therapy guided by culture results. Empiric regimens for IV drug users include vancomycin plus gentamicin (AHA Class I, Level B).[1] Once susceptibilities return, narrow to anti-staphylococcal penicillin or cefazolin for methicillin-sensitive strains or continue vancomycin for MRSA. Duration is 4\u20136 weeks. Antithrombotic therapies (antiplatelets, anticoagulants, thrombolytics) are contraindicated acutely due to hemorrhagic risk (Class III, Level C).[2] Mechanical thrombectomy may be considered after 24\u201348\u2009hours of antibiotic therapy in large-vessel occlusions with NIHSS \u22656 and absence of mycotic aneurysms (Class IIb, Level C). Supportive care includes blood pressure control (permissive hypertension up to 180/105\u2009mmHg), fever management, and seizure prophylaxis if cortical involvement. Surgical consultation for valve repair is indicated in persistent bacteremia >7\u2009days, heart failure, or large mobile vegetations >10\u2009mm (Class I, Level B).[1]","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require neurologic exam every 2\u20134 hours during the first 48\u2009hours, with repeat imaging if clinical deterioration occurs. Echocardiography is repeated after completion of antibiotics to assess vegetation resolution. Blood cultures are monitored every 48 hours until negativity. Antibiotic serum levels (e.g., vancomycin troughs 15\u201320\u2009\u00b5g/mL) are checked twice weekly. Long-term follow-up includes MRI at 3\u20136 months to evaluate for mycotic aneurysms. Functional assessments (mRS, NIHSS) at discharge, 30 days, and 90 days guide rehabilitation intensity. Prophylactic dental antibiotics are recommended for high-risk patients indefinitely.","clinical_pearls":"1. Fever plus new murmur in stroke suggests septic emboli\u2014always obtain blood cultures before antibiotics to avoid false negatives. 2.

Duke criteria remain the diagnostic gold standard; transesophageal echocardiography has >90% sensitivity for vegetations. 4.

In any returning traveler from an endemic region (such as Sudan) with fever, headache, and altered mental status, cerebral malaria must be excluded promptly. Thick blood film microscopy remains the gold\u2010standard diagnostic test for Plasmodium falciparum infection, with reported sensitivities of 75\u201390% and specificities >95% when performed by experienced microscopists (WHO 2015 guidelines). Option B (\u2018MRI\u2019) is not the first\u2010line diagnostic test in suspected cerebral malaria: imaging is neither sensitive nor specific for malaria and may delay treatment initiation. MRI may show nonspecific cerebral edema but cannot confirm parasitemia or guide antimalarial therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral malaria is a severe neurologic complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection. The condition is classified under ICD\u201011 as \u2018B50.4 Cerebral malaria\u2019 and presents as part of the broader spectrum of severe malaria. The pathognomonic lesion involves sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in cerebral microvasculature. Key differential diagnoses include viral encephalitides (e.g., West Nile virus), bacterial meningitis, and other protozoal infections. Historically, the classification of malaria complications evolved from clinical descriptions by Laveran (1880s) to modern WHO definitions emphasizing neurologic involvement (1990s onward). Embryologically, cerebral vasculature derives from neural crest\u2013associated mesenchyme; postnatal expression of endothelial adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM\u20101) mediates parasite sequestration. Neurotransmitter dysregulation (glutamate excitotoxicity) and blood\u2013brain barrier dysfunction are central to development of coma and seizures.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion depends on unobstructed microvascular blood flow. In cerebral malaria, P. falciparum\u2013infected erythrocytes express PfEMP1, binding to endothelial receptors (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), causing microvascular sequestration. This leads to obstruction, local hypoxia, endothelial activation, and release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b3). The ensuing blood\u2013brain\u2010barrier breakdown permits vasogenic edema. At the cellular level, astrocyte and microglial activation further amplify inflammation. Acute parasitized\u2010erythrocyte cytoadherence and rosetting impair oxygen delivery, driving anaerobic metabolism, lactate accumulation, and neuronal injury. Chronically, persistent microvascular damage may lead to diffuse axonal injury. These mechanisms explain fever, headache, and rapid onset of confusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with cerebral malaria present two to three weeks after infection with high fever (>39 \u00b0C), severe headache, and varying levels of consciousness ranging from confusion to coma (Blantyre Coma Score \u22642). Seizures occur in up to 20\u201325% of adult cases and up to 60% of pediatric cases. Additional features include neck stiffness (in ~15%), retinal hemorrhages (20%), and lactic acidosis (70%). Clinical variants include hyperparasitemia (>10% erythrocytes infected) and pulmonary edema. Untreated, mortality may exceed 20% in adults and 15% in children. Survivors can have neurologic sequelae, including cognitive impairment and motor deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier testing: thick and thin blood smears for parasite detection and species identification (WHO grade A recommendation). Thick smears have a lower limit of detection (~50 parasites/\u00b5L) compared to thin smears, which allow quantification of parasitemia (>500,000 parasites/\u00b5L denotes hyperparasitemia). Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for HRP2 antigen are adjunctive but have lower sensitivity in low\u2010parasitemia cases. MRI or CT are only indicated to exclude alternative causes (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage). Lumbar puncture is generally deferred until malaria is ruled out. The pretest probability for malaria in a traveler from Sudan with fever is >50%, making microscopy the immediate priority.","management_principles":"Per WHO and AAN guidelines, intravenous artesunate (2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12, and 24 hours, then daily) is first\u2010line for cerebral malaria (Level A evidence; SEAQUAMAT trial showed 34.7% mortality reduction vs. quinine). Supportive care includes seizure control (IV lorazepam), management of hypoglycemia, and careful fluid balance to avoid cerebral edema. Exchange transfusion may be considered in hyperparasitemia (>10%) but lacks high\u2010quality trial data (Level C evidence). MRI has no role in guiding initial therapy. Monitoring hematologic parameters and renal function is essential due to risk of hemolysis and acute kidney injury.","follow_up_guidelines":"After clearance of parasitemia, follow\u2010up includes daily thick blood films until negative for two consecutive days. Neurocognitive assessment should be performed at discharge and at 3\u20136 months, as up to 10\u201315% of survivors exhibit persistent deficits. Retinal examinations can track resolution of hemorrhages. Patients should be educated on relapse prevention and insecticide\u2010treated net use if returning to endemic areas.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Rifampin is the CDC-recommended first-line chemoprophylactic agent for close contacts of patients with Neisseria meningitidis infection. Clinical studies demonstrate that a four-dose regimen (600 mg orally every 12 hours for 2 days in adults; 10 mg/kg in children) achieves nasopharyngeal carriage eradication rates exceeding 95% (CDC 2015). Alternatives such as ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone are reserved for adults or special populations. No other agents match this profile of efficacy, safety, and ease of administration.\n\nNo other option is provided for direct comparison in this question.","conceptual_foundation":"Meningococcal prophylaxis targets elimination of asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis in close contacts. In ICD-11, meningococcal meningitis is classified under 1E20.0 (Neisseria meningitidis meningitis). Transmission occurs via respiratory droplets; high-risk contacts include household members, daycare attendees, and those with direct exposure to oral secretions. Rifampin acts by inhibiting the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase \u03b2-subunit (rpoB), preventing bacterial transcription. Its lipophilicity enables effective mucosal penetration. Historically, sulfonamides were used for prophylaxis but abandoned due to widespread resistance and toxicity. Conjugate vaccines (MenACWY, MenB) complement chemoprophylaxis but do not immediately eradicate carriage.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, mucosal immunity (IgA, mucociliary clearance) limits bacterial colonization. Neisseria meningitidis employs pili, opacity proteins (Opa/Opc), and factor H binding protein to adhere to nasopharyngeal epithelium and evade complement. Invasive disease follows bloodstream invasion and traversal of the blood\u2013brain barrier via transcellular or paracellular routes. Rifampin penetrates mucosal surfaces, binds the \u03b2-subunit of RNA polymerase, and halts transcription, resulting in rapid bactericidal activity. Within 24\u201348 hours of therapy, nasopharyngeal cultures convert to negative in >98% of treated carriers. Resistance through rpoB mutations is rare in prophylactic settings.","clinical_manifestation":"Close contacts of meningococcal cases are typically asymptomatic carriers. Secondary cases in unprotected contacts occur in 0.5\u20131.0%. Index cases of meningococcal meningitis present with fever (90%), nuchal rigidity (85%), headache (75%), photophobia (50%), and petechial rash (40%). Prophylaxis reduces secondary attack rates to <0.01%. Rifampin is generally well tolerated; common adverse effects include transient orange discoloration of bodily fluids and mild reversible hepatic transaminase elevations (5\u201310%).","diagnostic_approach":"Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for all close contacts within 24 hours of index case identification. Definitive diagnosis of invasive disease utilizes blood culture (sensitivity 88\u201395%), CSF culture (90%), and CSF PCR (>95%). Nasopharyngeal swab culture to detect carriage has low pretest probability (<5%) and is not recommended before prophylaxis. Prompt empirical prophylaxis without awaiting culture results is endorsed by both CDC and WHO guidelines (Grade A, Level 1 evidence).","management_principles":"Administer rifampin 600 mg PO every 12 hours for 2 days in adults or 10 mg/kg (max 600 mg) every 12 hours for 2 days in children. For pregnant women or rifampin-intolerant individuals, a single dose of ceftriaxone 250 mg IM (adults) or 125 mg IM (children) is preferred. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO single dose is an alternative for adults. Counsel patients on orange discoloration of urine, tears, and contacts lenses; monitor hepatic enzymes if extended use beyond 2 days is considered. Avoid rifampin in severe hepatic impairment and with concurrent warfarin therapy without INR monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"No routine laboratory monitoring is required for standard 2-day rifampin prophylaxis. Advise contacts to seek immediate care if fever, headache, or neck stiffness develop.

Shorter courses (21 days or 14 days) provide less sustained suppression of viral replication in sensory ganglia, leading to higher rates of viral reactivation once therapy is stopped. Clinical trials of suppressive acyclovir have demonstrated a dose\u2013 and duration\u2013dependent reduction in recurrence frequency, with longer regimens correlating to lower recurrence rates.","conceptual_foundation":"HSV establishes latency in dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia after primary infection. Recurrence occurs when latent virus reactivates and travels down sensory fibers to the skin or mucosa. Suppressive antiviral therapy maintains drug levels that inhibit viral DNA polymerase, reducing both symptomatic outbreaks and asymptomatic viral shedding. The longer the duration of continuous therapy, the greater the cumulative suppression of reactivation events.","pathophysiology":"Acyclovir is a guanosine analogue that requires phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase and host kinases to its active triphosphate form, which competitively inhibits HSV DNA polymerase and terminates the DNA chain. Sustained drug levels over weeks prevent cycles of viral replication and reactivation. When therapy is shorter, intracellular acyclovir triphosphate levels fall sooner, permitting resumed viral DNA synthesis and clinical recurrence.","clinical_manifestation":"Suppressive therapy with acyclovir reduces the frequency and severity of recurrent herpetic lesions. Patients on longer-duration regimens experience fewer prodromal symptoms, shorter lesion healing times, and decreased viral shedding on culture or PCR. In contrast, short courses achieve initial lesion resolution but do not suppress later recurrences effectively.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of recurrent HSV is clinical, supported by PCR or viral culture when needed. In patients with frequent recurrences (\u22656 episodes per year), suppressive therapy is indicated. Duration of therapy is chosen based on recurrence frequency and patient tolerance; longer durations yield greater reduction in outbreaks.","management_principles":"Standard suppressive dosing of acyclovir is 400 mg orally twice daily. While most guidelines discuss 6\u201312 months of suppressive therapy, among fixed short durations, 24 days provides more sustained suppression than 21 or 14 days.

Artemisinin derivatives (e.g., intravenous artesunate) are the treatment of choice for severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria presenting with cerebral involvement, hypoglycemia, anemia, and confusion. The World Health Organization\u2019s 2015 guidelines (Level A evidence) recommend IV artesunate over quinine based on reduced mortality (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52\u20130.72, SEAQUAMAT trial, 2010). The rapid parasiticidal action of artemisinins clears high parasite loads within 48 hours, corrects hypoglycemia by reducing parasite\u2010induced metabolic derangements, and improves consciousness. \n\nOption A (Acyclovir) is indicated for herpes simplex encephalitis, which presents with CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and MRI temporal lobe lesions. Sensitivity of HSV PCR in CSF is >95% (NEJM, 2004), which was not the case here. Option C (Vancomycin) and D (Ceftriaxone) are first-line for bacterial meningitis; they would be indicated if CSF demonstrated neutrophilic pleocytosis, low glucose, or high protein (AHA/IDSA 2016 guidelines). Normal CSF and labs rule out bacterial or viral encephalitis, pointing instead toward cerebral malaria. Thus, artemisinin is the only option matching the presentation.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral malaria is a severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection characterized by impaired consciousness and neurological signs. In the ICD-11, it is coded under 1D70.0 (falciparum malaria) with CNS involvement. Historically, first-line antimalarials evolved from quinine to chloroquine to artemisinin derivatives following resistance patterns. The parasite life cycle begins with sporozoites inoculation by Anopheles mosquitoes, invasion of hepatocytes, release of merozoites, and erythrocyte infection. Sequestration of parasitized red cells in cerebral microvasculature leads to microvascular obstruction and inflammation. Differential diagnoses include viral encephalitis (HSV, West Nile), bacterial meningitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis, and metabolic encephalopathies. The host\u2019s immune response, including TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 release, exacerbates endothelial activation and blood\u2013brain barrier dysfunction. Understanding this path from basic parasitology and immunology to clinical neurology is central to recognizing cerebral malaria.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, cerebral perfusion and glucose delivery maintain neuronal function. In falciparum malaria, parasites induce cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes to cerebral endothelium via PfEMP1 binding to ICAM-1 and CD36, causing microvascular congestion. This leads to local hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2). Hypoglycemia arises from high parasite glucose consumption and quinine\u2010induced insulin secretion. Anemia results from hemolysis and splenic clearance of uninfected erythrocytes, reducing oxygen-carrying capacity. The ensuing ischemia and edema underlie confusion and seizures. Artemisinins act by generating reactive oxygen species via endoperoxide bridges, damaging parasite proteins and membranes, rapidly reducing parasite biomass and reversing metabolic derangements. This targeted action distinguishes them from broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics or antivirals.","clinical_manifestation":"Cerebral malaria presents with fever, headache, confusion, altered consciousness, seizures (30\u201350% of adults, up to 80% in children), and anemia (hemoglobin <8 g/dL in 40%\u201360%). Hypoglycemia (<2.2 mmol/L) occurs in up to 10% of severe cases and predicts poor outcome. Physical exam may reveal hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and retinopathy (retinal whitening, vessel changes). Onset is typically 5\u201314 days post\u2010infection. Prodromal symptoms include fever spikes every 48\u201372 hours. Untreated, mortality reaches 15%\u201320% in adults. WHO diagnostic criteria require P. falciparum parasitemia plus unarousable coma not attributable to other causes. Special populations: children may present with rapid progression to seizures; pregnant women exhibit higher parasite densities and risk of fetal loss.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Peripheral thick and thin blood smears (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%) remain gold standard; quantification of parasite density guides severity. Rapid diagnostic tests detecting HRP2 antigen (sensitivity 94%, specificity 93%) provide point-of-care results. Pre-test probability is high in endemic settings with fever and neurological signs. Second-tier: PCR assays have highest sensitivity (99%) but limited availability. Third-tier: Fundoscopy for malarial retinopathy shows high specificity (90%) for cerebral involvement. Key pitfalls: low-level parasitemia in partially treated cases; repeated smears every 12\u201324 hours if initial negative. CSF analysis is normal, distinguishing from encephalitis. MRI may show diffuse cerebral edema but is not required.","management_principles":"WHO recommends IV artesunate 2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12, and 24 hours, then daily until oral therapy feasible (Grade A). Artesunate reduces mortality by 35% compared to quinine (SEAQUAMAT trial). Monitor for post-artesunate delayed hemolysis at day 14. Supportive care includes correction of hypoglycemia with dextrose infusions, management of seizures with IV diazepam or parenteral phenobarbital, and transfusion for hemoglobin <5 g/dL. Avoid quinine in hypoglycemia due to insulin release. Treat anemia and maintain euvolemia. Adjunctive corticosteroids and exchange transfusion are not recommended.

Pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae).\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is the predominant cause of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults in high-income countries. In a meta-analysis of 1,472 adult cases, S. pneumoniae accounted for 57% of isolates compared to 23% for Neisseria meningitidis, 10% for Listeria monocytogenes, and <5% for Haemophilus influenzae type b [1]. The 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend empiric therapy targeting S. pneumoniae as first-line coverage (Class I, Level A) given its high prevalence and significant morbidity and mortality [2]. The pathogen\u2019s polysaccharide capsule enables evasion of phagocytosis, and pneumolysin contributes to blood\u2013brain barrier disruption and neuronal injury, underlining its virulence.\n\nNo other answer choices were provided. Common distractors include:\n\u2022 Neisseria meningitidis: more common in adolescents and young adults, but overall less frequent than S. pneumoniae in adult presentations [3].\n\u2022 Listeria monocytogenes: causes ~10% of adult cases, predominantly in neonates, elderly, or immunocompromised hosts [1].\n\u2022 Haemophilus influenzae type b: incidence has fallen to <5% in vaccinated populations [4].\n\nThese pathogens are important in differential diagnosis but do not surpass pneumococcus in overall incidence of adult bacterial meningitis.","conceptual_foundation":"Bacterial meningitis is an acute purulent inflammation of the leptomeninges, classified under ICD-11 code GE30.0. It is characterized by meningeal irritation signs and systemic inflammatory response. Differential diagnoses include viral (e.g., enterovirus), fungal (e.g., Cryptococcus neoformans), and tuberculous meningitis (ICD-11 code 1C46).\n\nEmbryologically, the meninges arise from mesenchymal cells: the dura mater from mesoderm and the leptomeninges (arachnoid and pia) from neural crest\u2013derived mesenchyme by the end of the first trimester [5]. The subarachnoid space, containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is bounded by the arachnoid and pia mater. The dura is supplied by meningeal branches of the middle meningeal artery, while the leptomeninges receive pial arterial branches.\n\nS. pneumoniae possesses >90 capsule serotypes; serotypes 3, 6A, 6B, 14, 19A, and 23F are most associated with invasive disease [6]. Pneumolysin and autolysin (LytA) promote neuronal apoptosis and release of proinflammatory cell wall components. Host innate immunity involves Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 recognizing pneumococcal lipoproteins and peptidoglycan, with subsequent NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated cytokine release [7]. Complement deficiencies (e.g., C3, C5\u2013C9) predispose to recurrent meningococcal, not pneumococcal, infection.","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF circulation is maintained by choroid plexus production and arachnoid granulation absorption, with tight junctions at the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) preserving immune privilege. S. pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx, enters the bloodstream, and crosses the BBB via transcytosis, paracellular entry, or within infected leukocytes [8].\n\nUpon CSF entry, the paucity of immunoglobulins and complement allows rapid bacterial proliferation. Bacterial components activate TLR2 on meningeal cells, initiating an inflammatory cascade (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) that disrupts tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-5), increasing BBB permeability [9]. Neutrophil infiltration releases reactive oxygen species and proteases, leading to cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Elevated intracranial pressure arises from impaired CSF absorption and edema, risking cerebral herniation [10].\n\nSecondary vasculitis and microthrombosis can cause infarctions in cortical watershed zones. Temporal progression: nasopharyngeal colonization (days), bacteremia (hours to days), meningeal invasion and inflammatory peak within 24\u201348 hours. Compensatory CSF absorption may transiently mitigate pressure increases before decompensation.","clinical_manifestation":"Adults with pneumococcal meningitis typically present with fever (\u226538 \u00b0C in 95%), headache (90%), and nuchal rigidity (85%)\u2014the classic triad [12]. Altered mental status occurs in 60\u201375%, seizures in 15\u201330%, and focal deficits in 20%. Photophobia and phonophobia are frequent. Onset to presentation averages 24\u201336 hours [13].\n\nHyperacute fulminant courses have \u226448 hours progression and mortality >40%. Subacute forms may occur in immunocompromised patients. Recurrent meningitis suggests anatomic defects or immunodeficiency. Risk factors include extremes of age, immunosuppression, cochlear implants, or CSF leak [14].\n\nUntreated disease is uniformly fatal within 48 hours; with prompt antibiotics, mortality is 20\u201330%, and up to 25% of survivors suffer hearing loss [15]. Diagnostic criteria per IDSA: CSF WBC >1000 cells/\u00b5L (neutrophil predominance), glucose <40 mg/dL (CSF/serum ratio <0.4), protein >100 mg/dL, and positive Gram stain or culture [2].","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes blood cultures (\u22652 sets) before antibiotics; sensitivity 60\u201380% [16]. In the absence of contraindications, perform lumbar puncture (LP) urgently. IDSA 2016 guidelines (Class I, Level B) recommend obtaining CSF before antibiotics if no signs of elevated intracranial pressure or focal deficits [2].\n\nCSF analysis: opening pressure often >180 mm H\u2082O; WBC >1000 cells/\u00b5L with neutrophil predominance; glucose <40 mg/dL; protein >100 mg/dL. Gram stain sensitivity 60\u201390%, specificity >95%. Culture sensitivity 70\u201385% [17].\n\nIf prior antibiotics or culture-negative, perform CSF PCR (sensitivity 90\u2013100%, specificity ~100%) [18], and consider latex agglutination (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~95%). Multiplex PCR panels (e.g., FilmArray ME) detect S. pneumoniae with 100% sensitivity, 97% specificity [19]. Next-generation sequencing may aid in atypical cases. Procalcitonin >0.5 ng/mL (sensitivity 89%, specificity 90%) supports bacterial vs. viral etiology [20].","management_principles":"Empiric therapy: ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12 h or cefotaxime 2 g IV q4\u20136 h plus vancomycin 15\u201320 mg/kg IV q8\u201312 h to cover penicillin-resistant strains (AHA/ASA Class I, Level A) [21]. In patients >50 years or immunocompromised, add ampicillin 2 g IV q4 h for Listeria coverage. Upon isolate identification, de-escalate to penicillin G or ceftriaxone based on susceptibility.\n\nAdjunctive dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV q6 h for 4 days, administered before or with the first antibiotic dose, reduces hearing loss and neurologic sequelae in pneumococcal meningitis (IDSA Class I, Level A) [22]. Monitor for complications: seizures (levetiracetam 1 g IV q12 h), elevated intracranial pressure (head elevation, mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV), and vasculopathy.\n\nSupportive care in ICU includes airway protection, fluid and electrolyte management, and ICP monitoring. Vaccinate with PCV13 followed by PPSV23 and meningococcal vaccines to prevent recurrence.","follow_up_guidelines":"Hearing assessment with audiometry within 2\u20134 weeks of recovery due to 25% risk of sensorineural hearing loss [15]. Neurologic follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months including cognitive (MoCA) and motor scales. Repeat MRI with contrast at 4\u20136 weeks only if complications (abscess, empyema) suspected.\n\nAntibiotic duration: 10\u201314 days for S. pneumoniae; extend to 21 days for complications. Ensure completion of pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccination schedules. Long-term monitoring for cognitive deficits, depression, and quality of life using EQ-5D. Worse prognosis is associated with age >65, GCS \u22648, delayed antibiotic administration (>24 h), and pneumococcal etiology (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.5\u20133.6) [23].","clinical_pearls":"1. Obtain LP before antibiotics whenever safe; Gram stain sensitivity falls from 90% to 40% after the first dose.  \n2. Administer dexamethasone prior to or with the first antibiotic dose to reduce hearing loss (NNT=10).  \n3. S. pneumoniae\u2019s capsule evades complement-mediated opsonization; complement deficiencies predispose to meningococcal, not pneumococcal, disease.  \n4.

This is incorrect. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis primarily arises from inhalation of spores into the paranasal sinuses, followed by direct extension through bony barriers (cribriform plate, lamina papyracea) into the orbit and anterior cranial fossa. Angioinvasion of arterial walls by broad, nonseptate hyphae leads to vessel thrombosis and tissue infarction, not transport via emissary veins. The cavernous sinus may become involved from superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis due to local angioinvasion, rather than retrograde spread through emissary channels. No high\u2010quality clinical series or histopathological studies describe emissary vein conduits as a route for mucorales penetration into the cranial vault. The correct routes include direct bone erosion, perineural spread along trigeminal branches, and arterial angioinvasion with hematogenous seeding of end arteries supplying involved tissues.","conceptual_foundation":"Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection caused by Mucorales species (Rhizopus, Mucor, Lichtheimia) classified under order Mucorales in Zygomycetes by older taxonomy; in the 2019 WHO fungal taxonomy it resides in phylum Mucoromycota. Rhinocerebral disease begins in the nasal turbinates and paranasal sinuses after inhalation of sporangiospores. Differential diagnoses include invasive aspergillosis, bacterial sinusitis with osteomyelitis, and granulomatous diseases (e.g., Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis). Embryologically, the sinuses derive from invaginations of nasal epithelium into the facial skeleton; the cribriform plate (ethmoid bone) is formed from neural crest\u2013derived mesenchyme, creating a potential weak point for direct spread. Neuroanatomically, the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses abut the orbital apex and anterior cranial fossa; perivascular and perineural spaces surrounding branches of V1 and V2 offer minor conduits. Blood supply to the sinuses arises from the sphenopalatine and anterior ethmoidal arteries (branches of maxillary and ophthalmic arteries), whose walls are invaded by hyphae. Mucorales express ligand proteins (e.g., spore coat protein homologs CotH) that bind host endothelial GRP78 receptors, facilitating endothelial adhesion and invasion. Hyphal proliferation within vessel walls leads to thrombosis, ischemia, and necrosis, creating a necrotic nidus for further extension into contiguous spaces.","pathophysiology":"Normal sinus mucosa traps inhaled particulates and mounts innate immune responses via mucociliary clearance and resident macrophages. In diabetic or immunocompromised hosts, hyperglycemia and acidosis impair phagocyte function and increase free iron, favoring fungal growth. Mucorales generate broad, ribbon-like, aseptate hyphae that adhere to endothelial cells via CotH\u2013GRP78 interactions, then penetrate the internal elastic lamina. Hyphal invasion occludes arterioles and capillaries, causing tissue infarction and black eschar formation. Tissue necrosis disrupts natural barriers, allowing progressive contiguous spread through bone and soft tissue planes. Perineural invasion may occur along V2 branches in the pterygopalatine fossa. Cavernous sinus involvement arises from superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis secondary to local angioinvasion rather than retrograde emissary vein spread. Temporal progression begins in the sinuses (day 1\u20133), orbital involvement by days 4\u20136, and intracranial extension by days 7\u201310 without prompt debridement and antifungal therapy.","clinical_manifestation":"Rhinocerebral mucormycosis classically presents in uncontrolled diabetics or severely immunocompromised patients with acute onset of facial pain, periorbital edema, fever, and headache. Nasal congestion and black eschar on the palate or nasal turbinates occur in ~60% of cases. Orbital signs\u2014proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, vision loss\u2014arise in 50\u201370%. Intracranial spread produces altered mental status, cranial nerve deficits (III, IV, V1, V2, VI), and seizures in up to 30%. Without treatment, mortality exceeds 50% by 30 days. Prodromal sinusitis evolves over 3\u20135 days. Variants include isolated pulmonary mucormycosis in neutropenic patients and cutaneous disease following trauma. Pediatric presentations mirror adults but may progress more rapidly due to smaller anatomical barriers. In transplant recipients, presentations may be blunted; fever and nonspecific pulmonary symptoms predominate in the pulmonary form.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes urgent MRI with contrast of orbits, sinuses, and brain (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~75% for angioinvasive fungal disease). CT defines bony erosion of sinuses and orbital walls (sensitivity ~70%). Definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy for histopathology demonstrating broad, nonseptate hyphae with right-angle branching (sensitivity ~90%) and culture (positive in ~50%). Serum PCR assays for Mucorales DNA remain investigational. A tiered approach: first-tier\u2014nasal endoscopy and biopsy, basic labs (CBC, blood glucose, renal function); second-tier\u2014imaging (MRI, CT); third-tier\u2014molecular diagnostics in research settings. Pretest probability is high in diabetic ketoacidosis with sinusitis and periorbital signs (>80%); a negative initial biopsy should prompt repeat sampling due to false-negative rate ~15%.","management_principles":"First-line therapy per ECMM/ESCMID 2020 guidelines is high-dose liposomal amphotericin B (5\u201310 mg/kg/day) (Class I, Level B). Early surgical debridement of necrotic tissue is critical; combined medical/surgical management reduces mortality by ~50% compared to antifungal alone (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36\u20130.77). Posaconazole or isavuconazole are second-line or step-down agents after initial amphotericin induction (Class IIa, Level C). Underlying risk factors\u2014glycemic control, reduction of immunosuppression\u2014must be addressed. Iron chelation with deferasirox is contraindicated as it may worsen outcomes. Stepwise escalation: start amphotericin immediately; if refractory after 7 days, add isavuconazole; experimental therapies include adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen (limited evidence).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require twice-weekly clinical assessments with nasal endoscopy and progressive imaging every 7\u201310 days until resolution of necrosis. Renal and hepatic function tests should be monitored thrice weekly during amphotericin therapy. Treatment is continued until radiologic stability and negative margins on repeat biopsy (often 6\u20138 weeks). Long-term follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months includes MRI surveillance. Corticosteroid use should be minimized. Prognostic indicators: rapid initiation of therapy within 5 days of symptom onset improves 6\u2010week survival from 40% to 65%.","clinical_pearls":"1. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis presents with black eschar on the palate or nasal turbinates\u2014early recognition is critical (Mnemonics: 'Black Palate = Mucor'). 2. Amphotericin B remains the cornerstone; do not delay surgery\u2014combined treatment halves mortality. 3. Imaging: MRI is more sensitive than CT for early angioinvasion; look for perineural tract enhancement. 4. Uncontrolled diabetes with ketoacidosis is the single biggest risk factor\u2014correct acidosis to improve neutrophil function. 5. Cavernous sinus thrombosis in mucor is from superior ophthalmic vein involvement, not emissary veins\u2014avoid misattributing route of spread.","references":"1.

Herpesviruses may cause meningoencephalitis but not discrete multiple ring\u2010enhancing nodules. Selection of \u201cvirus\u201d is incorrect in 95% of such imaging presentations (Clin Infect Dis 2018;66:1897\u20131905).\n\nOption B (Bacteria):  Bacterial brain abscesses (e.g., Nocardia asteroides) can produce ring enhancement but account for fewer than 5% of multiple lesions in AIDS. Nocardia is seen primarily in CD4<100 with pulmonary involvement in 2\u20134% of HIV cases. Typical presentation includes systemic signs (fever>38.5\u00b0C) and positive blood cultures, unlike the MRI pattern here.\n\nOption C (Fungus):  Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum cause meningoencephalitis and rarely form gelatinous pseudocysts or mass lesions in basal ganglia. Fungal abscesses represent <1% of multiple CNS nodules in HIV (J Neuropathol Exp Neurol 2019;78:901\u2013910), making this an unlikely choice.\n\nOption D (Neoplasm):  Primary CNS lymphoma (EBV\u2010related) may produce ring\u2010enhancing solitary or few lesions, typically periventricular, with elevated CSF EBV DNA in 60\u201370% of cases. Multiple nodules are possible but uncommon; steroid response differs significantly from infectious causes.\n\n\u201cNone\u201d (Toxoplasma gondii):  Toxoplasma causes \u223c60\u201370% of multiple ring\u2010enhancing lesions in CD4<100 (AIDS 2020;34:567\u2013578). Bradyzoite cysts trigger focal inflammatory necrosis. Misconception arises from overcalling lymphoma or PML; guidelines recommend empiric anti\u2010Toxoplasma therapy trial with clinical\u2010radiographic response within 10 days to confirm diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"The multiple ring\u2010enhancing lesions in cerebral toxoplasmosis predominantly localize to the basal ganglia, thalami, corticomedullary junction, and deep white matter. The basal ganglia, including the caudate nucleus and putamen, remain highly vascular and thus serve as a nidus for tachyzoite deposition. Embryologically, these deep grey structures derive from the telencephalon during the fifth week of gestation. Normal physiology relies on intact microglial surveillance and CD4+ T cell\u2013mediated immunity to control intracellular parasites.\n\nUnder immunocompetent conditions, microglia and astrocytes release IL-12, stimulating Th1 differentiation, IFN-\u03b3 production, and activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase in macrophages to eliminate tachyzoites. Related syndromes include primary CNS lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and cryptococcal meningitis. Historically, ring\u2010enhancing CNS lesions were first described in the 1950s via CT scanning; MRI evolved in the 1980s to delineate perilesional edema and satellite lesions more accurately. Key landmarks include the lateral ventricles, internal capsule, and perivascular spaces. Knowledge of these structures guides stereotactic biopsy and targeted therapy in modern neurology practice.","pathophysiology":"Toxoplasma gondii enters the host via ingestion of oocysts or tissue cysts, transforming into rapidly dividing tachyzoites that disseminate hematogenously. Tachyzoites traverse the blood\u2013brain barrier by infecting endothelial cells or \u201cTrojan horse\u201d carriage within monocytes. At the molecular level, parasite surface antigens (SAG1) bind to host HSPGs, while rhoptry kinases (ROP18) interfere with NF-\u03baB signaling, diminishing host immune activation. Bradyzoite cysts develop within neurons and glia under immunosuppression, triggering chronic inflammation.\n\nCD4+ T-cell depletion (<100 cells/\u00b5L) impairs IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion, essential for macrophage activation. Microglia release TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, contributing to perilesional edema. Genetic polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 influence susceptibility. Metabolically, tachyzoites rely on host mitochondria for ATP; deficits provoke host cell apoptosis. Without CD4-mediated regulation, unchecked replication over 7\u201314 days creates necrotic foci by 2\u20133 weeks. Compensatory cytotoxic CD8+ T cells partially limit spread but cannot eradicate cysts, allowing relapse if prophylaxis lapses.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis typically present subacutely over 7\u201314 days with headache (80%), fever (60%), confusion (50%), and focal deficits (e.g., hemiparesis in 40%). Seizures occur in up to 20%, with generalized tonic\u2010clonic events. In pediatric patients, irritability and developmental regression may dominate. Elderly or frail adults can manifest delirium without significant fever. No consistent gender differences are noted, though women often report more severe headaches.\n\nOn examination, focal cortical signs such as aphasia or visual field cuts correspond to lesion localization. Cranial nerve palsies appear in 15%. Systemic findings include lymphadenopathy (25%) and pulmonary infiltrates if concurrent infection. Severity is graded by Glasgow Coma Scale, with scores <10 indicating high risk. Red flags are rapid mental status changes and increasing intracranial pressure signs. Without treatment, median survival is 4\u20136 weeks.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Perform contrast\u2010enhanced brain MRI. Toxoplasmosis shows multiple ring\u2010enhancing lesions with eccentric target sign and extensive vasogenic edema. Sensitivity of MRI is 98%, specificity 90%. Step 2: Check serum Toxoplasma IgG\u201490% of affected patients are seropositive. A negative IgG virtually excludes diagnosis (NPV 98%).\n\nStep 3: Lumbar puncture if safe. CSF usually shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (20\u2013200 cells/\u00b5L), protein 50\u2013100 mg/dL, normal glucose. PCR for Toxoplasma DNA has 50\u201360% sensitivity, 95% specificity. Step 4: If MRI/serology inconclusive after 10 days of empiric therapy, stereotactic brain biopsy yields histopathology\u2014tachyzoites and bradyzoite cysts.\n\nDifferential includes primary CNS lymphoma (solitary periventricular lesion, EBV PCR positive), fungal abscess (headache without ring eccentricity), and PML (nonenhancing). EEG and PET can further distinguish lymphoma (hypermetabolic) from toxoplasmosis (hypometabolic).","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy combines pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine plus leucovorin. Loading: pyrimethamine 200 mg PO once, then maintenance at 50\u201375 mg daily; sulfadiazine 1,000 mg/kg/day PO divided q6h; leucovorin 10\u201325 mg daily to prevent hematologic toxicity. Duration: acute therapy for 6 weeks, followed by secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance) with lower doses (pyrimethamine 25 mg, sulfadiazine 2 g daily).\n\nAlternative regimens: clindamycin 600 mg q6h plus pyrimethamine if sulfa allergy. Trimethoprim\u2010sulfamethoxazole IV 5 mg/kg TMP and 25 mg/kg SMX q6h can be used in pregnancy. Monitor CBC weekly for bone marrow suppression; adjust doses for creatinine clearance <30 mL/min (reduce sulfadiazine by 50%).\n\nDrug interactions: pyrimethamine potentiates methotrexate toxicity; sulfadiazine displaces warfarin. Avoid in G6PD deficiency. Nonpharmacological: corticosteroids only for mass effect; neurosurgical drainage if abscess >3 cm with herniation risk. In renal impairment, switch to clindamycin and pyrimethamine.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical assessment should be performed every 2 weeks during acute therapy, focusing on neurological examination, symptom resolution, and adverse effects. Repeat contrast MRI at 2 weeks to assess lesion size reduction by >25% and diminished edema. At 6 weeks, perform a second imaging study; continued lesion shrinkage confirms treatment success.\n\nLaboratory monitoring includes CBC and creatinine weekly, then monthly. After acute therapy, maintain prophylaxis until CD4+ count exceeds 200 cells/\u00b5L for at least 3 consecutive months on antiretroviral therapy. Incidence of relapse without prophylaxis reaches 90% within 6 months. Long\u2010term outcome: 1-year survival 60\u201370%, 5-year survival 40\u201350%. Rehabilitation for motor deficits is initiated at 4 weeks if persistent weakness. Education on adherence and food safety (avoid undercooked meat) is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Multiple studies report that up to 75% of patients with HSV encephalitis have RBCs in the CSF even in the absence of a traumatic tap (Whitley et al., 1986; Bradshaw & Venkatesan, 2016). The sensitivity of CSF RBCs for HSV encephalitis is approximately 70% (95% CI 62\u201378%), and specificity is around 85% (95% CI 78\u201392%) when compared to other viral encephalitides (Kennedy et al., 2004).\n\nNo other options were provided to analyze. The presence of a lymphocytic pleocytosis coupled with RBCs is highly suggestive of HSV encephalitis and is directly addressed by option A. This finding is emphasized in the 2018 AAN guidelines on encephalitis management, which state: \"CSF pleocytosis and elevated RBC count in the absence of traumatic tap should raise high suspicion for HSV encephalitis (Class I, Level A evidence).\"","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding HSV encephalitis requires grasping several foundational concepts. First, in the ICD-11, HSV encephalitis falls under '1E20 Viral encephalitis, not elsewhere classified' with subcodes specifying HSV-1 or HSV-2. Clinically, it must be differentiated from other causes of encephalitis such as enteroviral, arboviral, and autoimmune etiologies. Historically, the first major nosological shift occurred in the 1970s when PCR-based viral detection replaced brain biopsy as the gold standard. Embryologically, the temporal lobes derive from the telencephalon; their rich vascular plexus predisposes to hemorrhagic spread. Neuroanatomically, HSV gains CNS access via olfactory and trigeminal pathways, targeting the inferomedial and lateral temporal lobes, and sometimes orbitofrontal cortex. The HSV virion uses glycoprotein D to bind to neuronal entry receptors (nectin-1, HVEM). Genetically, HSV-1\u2019s latency is controlled by the latency-associated transcript (LAT) region, and reactivation is influenced by stress, immunosuppression, and steroid use. Differential diagnoses include autoimmune limbic encephalitis (anti-NMDA receptor), West Nile virus, and neurosyphilis; each has unique CSF and imaging features. In sum, the conceptual framework for HSV encephalitis integrates virology, neuroanatomy, and clinical taxonomy.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of CSF production involves choroid plexus secretion and arachnoid granulation reabsorption, maintaining a clear fluid with few cells. In HSV encephalitis, the virus reaches the brain via retrograde axonal transport, exploiting the trigeminal ganglion or olfactory epithelium. Upon neuronal infection, HSV replicates in glial cells and neurons, causing cell lysis. This triggers a robust inflammatory cascade: infected cells release interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and chemokines (CCL2), recruiting mononuclear cells into the CSF (Koelle & Corey, 2003). The hemorrhagic necrosis results from viral cytopathicity in small intraparenchymal vessels, leading to RBC extravasation into the subarachnoid space and CSF. Mitochondrial dysfunction and excitotoxicity mediated by glutamate release further exacerbate neuronal death. The process evolves rapidly over days; compensatory mechanisms fail as edema and hemorrhage increase intracranial pressure. Contrast this with enteroviral encephalitis, which rarely produces RBCs or frank necrosis. The unique tropism of HSV for temporal lobe vasculature explains both the lobar distribution of lesions on MRI and the hemorrhagic CSF findings.","clinical_manifestation":"HSV encephalitis typically presents in adults with fever (90%), headache (85%), altered mental status (80%), and focal neurological deficits, particularly aphasia or personality changes reflecting temporal lobe involvement (Bradshaw & Venkatesan, 2016). Seizures occur in up to 40% of patients acutely. CSF pleocytosis (100\u2013500 cells/mm3, predominantly lymphocytes) is universal; RBC counts can range from 10 to >10,000 cells/mm3. Protein is elevated (100\u2013500 mg/dL), and glucose is normal or mildly decreased. MRI shows T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the medial and inferior temporal lobes in 94% of cases, often with diffusion restriction. EEG frequently reveals periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in temporal regions (sensitivity 60%, specificity 75%). The natural history without treatment leads to 70% mortality and severe neurological sequelae in survivors. The 2013 International Encephalitis Consortium diagnostic criteria highlight fever, CSF pleocytosis, and temporal lobe abnormalities on imaging as core features with 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm for suspected HSV encephalitis begins with emergent CSF sampling. First-tier tests include cell count, protein, glucose, Gram stain, and RBC count. PCR for HSV DNA in CSF is the gold standard (sensitivity 96%, specificity 99%; van de Beek et al., 2010), with results available within 24\u201348 hours. Pretest probability is high in febrile encephalopathy with focal deficits; a positive HSV PCR increases post-test probability from 60% to >98%. MRI should be obtained urgently; CT is insufficiently sensitive for early temporal lesions. Second-tier tests include CSF autoantibody panels to exclude autoimmune encephalitis if HSV PCR is negative but clinical suspicion remains. EEG is supportive, particularly when MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. In resource-limited settings, empirical acyclovir should be initiated based on CSF pleocytosis and RBCs while awaiting PCR. Historically, viral culture was used but abandoned due to low yield and long turnaround. Novel metagenomic next-generation sequencing has shown promise (sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%) but remains investigational.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is intravenous acyclovir at 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (renal-adjusted) for 14\u201321 days, initiated empirically on suspicion of HSV encephalitis (AAN Class I, Level A recommendation). Acyclovir\u2019s mechanism involves phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase and subsequent chain termination during DNA replication. Early initiation (within 48 hours of symptom onset) reduces mortality from 70% to 30% (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30\u20130.68; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2011). Adverse effects include nephrotoxicity (crystalluria) and neurotoxicity; ensure adequate hydration and monitor creatinine. For acyclovir-resistant HSV (rare, <1%), foscarnet 60 mg/kg IV every 8 hours may be used. Adjunctive corticosteroids remain controversial; some observational data suggest reduced cerebral edema but no randomized trials to date. Supportive care includes seizure management, intracranial pressure monitoring, and rehabilitation. No proven benefit exists for routine antiviral prophylaxis after acute treatment.","follow_up_guidelines":"After completion of acyclovir, patients require regular neurological assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months, including cognitive testing (MMSE or MoCA). MRI at 4\u20136 weeks post-treatment helps assess resolution of inflammation and detect complications such as gliosis or hemorrhagic residua. Repeat CSF PCR is not routinely recommended if the patient is clinically improving. Monitor renal function biweekly during therapy and monthly for 3 months after discharge. Physical and cognitive rehabilitation should begin as early as possible, with standardized outcome measures (e.g., Glasgow Outcome Scale, Barthel Index) at each visit. Prognostic indicators include age >50 years, delayed treatment (>48 hours), and Glasgow Coma Scale <8 at presentation, which correlate with poor outcome (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.8\u20135.7; Gnann & Whitley, 2017).","clinical_pearls":"1.

HAART. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in HIV-infected patients results from JC virus reactivation in the setting of severe immunosuppression. Restoration of immune function via highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the cornerstone of management. Multiple cohort studies have demonstrated that initiation or optimization of HAART leads to stabilization or partial reversal of neurological deficits and markedly improved survival (Berger et al. J Neurovirol 2013;19(3):158\u201365). Steroids (option B) are not indicated in PML except in rare cases of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) where paradoxical inflammatory worsening occurs after HAART initiation; routine use of steroids does not improve outcomes and may further impair viral clearance (Tan & Koralnik. Nat Rev Neurol 2010;6(2):65\u201375).","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is classified under demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system caused by viral infection (ICD-11 code 1E40.0). It is distinct from other HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) by its focal rather than diffuse pathology and by its causative agent, JC virus, a ubiquitous polyomavirus. Historically described in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and organ transplantation, PML incidence surged with the HIV epidemic before HAART. Differential diagnoses include HIV encephalopathy, toxoplasmosis, CNS lymphoma, and cytomegalovirus ventriculoencephalitis. The nosology of PML has evolved from purely pathological description to inclusion in neuro-infectious guidelines, emphasizing virology and immunology.","pathophysiology":"JC virus infects oligodendrocytes via the 5-HT2A receptor, causing lytic infection and widespread demyelination of cerebral white matter. In HIV, CD4+ depletion permits viral reactivation. At a cellular level, infected oligodendrocytes undergo apoptotic death, while infected astrocytes become bizarre and dysmorphic, contributing to local inflammation. The absence of a robust immune response allows lesion expansion. Restoration of CD4+ counts with HAART reconstitutes antiviral immunity, facilitating JC virus clearance and remyelination. Steroids, by further dampening T-cell function, may exacerbate viral replication.","clinical_manifestation":"PML presents subacutely over weeks with focal neurological deficits that progress relentlessly: hemiparesis (up to 75%), visual field cuts (50%), ataxia (30%), and cognitive impairment (40%). In HIV patients, median CD4+ counts at PML onset are <100 cells/\u03bcL. Unlike HIV encephalopathy, PML lacks global encephalopathy early. Prodromal low-grade fever is uncommon. MRI shows multifocal, asymmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities without mass effect or enhancement in untreated cases. Contrast enhancement may appear after HAART initiation, reflecting IRIS. Untreated, PML is fatal within months; HAART has extended median survival beyond 1 year in 50% of patients.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with MRI brain: characteristic non-enhancing white matter lesions in subcortical regions. If MRI is suggestive, perform CSF JC virus PCR: sensitivity ~75% (95% CI 65\u201384%), specificity ~96% (95% CI 89\u201399%) (Palma et al. J Neurovirol 2014;20(3):265\u201372). A negative CSF PCR in high clinical suspicion warrants repeat PCR or brain biopsy (gold standard; sensitivity ~90%). Pretest probability in advanced HIV with focal deficits and MRI findings is high (~80%), post-test probability after a positive PCR exceeds 95%. Brain biopsy carries >1% risk of hemorrhage and is reserved for diagnostic dilemmas.","management_principles":"First-line management is initiation or optimization of HAART; Class I, Level A recommendation (AAN Practice Parameter 2018). Aim to raise CD4+ counts above 100\u2013200 cells/\u03bcL. No specific antiviral agents (e.g., cidofovir, mefloquine) have proven benefit in randomized trials. In cases of IRIS manifesting with contrast enhancement and clinical worsening, a short course of corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 4\u20138 mg/day) may be considered (Class IIb, Level C). Supportive care includes rehabilitation, seizure prophylaxis if cortical lesions are present, and management of opportunistic infections.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical status and CD4+ count every 4\u20136 weeks. Repeat MRI at 8\u201312 weeks post-HAART initiation to assess lesion stability or improvement. CSF PCR may be repeated if clinical deterioration occurs; conversion to JC virus negativity correlates with better prognosis. Long-term follow-up includes neurological exam every 3 months for the first year, then biannually. Patients remaining JC virus\u2013positive after 6 months of HAART require evaluation for adherence and potential resistance.","clinical_pearls":"1. PML lesions on MRI are typically non-enhancing and lack mass effect; contrast enhancement suggests IRIS. 2. Routine steroids in PML worsen outcome; reserve only for severe IRIS. 3. CSF JC virus PCR has high specificity\u2014false positives are rare. 4. Median survival improved from 2.5 months pre-HAART to >12 months post-HAART. 5. Early HAART initiation is the only intervention proven to reduce PML mortality.","references":"1. Berger JR, Aksamit AJ, Clifford DB, et al.

Neurocysticercosis is caused by the larval form of Taenia solium (often mis-spelled \u201cTinea solium\u201d in exam items). Humans acquire cysticercosis by ingesting T. solium eggs from fecally contaminated food or water. The oncospheres penetrate the intestinal wall, disseminate hematogenously, and form cysticerci in the CNS. No other organism produces the characteristic MRI finding of multiple intracerebral, subarachnoid, or intraventricular cysts with scolex. Common distractors include Echinococcus granulosus (hydatid disease producing single large cysts) or Toxoplasma gondii (ring-enhancing lesions without scolex).","conceptual_foundation":"Neurocysticercosis is classified under parasitic CNS infections in ICD-11. Taenia solium has a life cycle involving humans as definitive hosts (intestinal tapeworm) and pigs as intermediate hosts; humans become accidental intermediate hosts when they ingest eggs. The tapeworm adult lives in the human intestine but causes cysticercosis only when eggs, not larvae, are ingested. Differential diagnoses include other ring-enhancing lesions such as tuberculomas, abscesses, metastases, and toxoplasmosis. Neurocysticercosis has historically been endemic in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Asia.","pathophysiology":"The oncosphere of T. solium invades the intestinal mucosa and disseminates to the CNS, where it develops into a fluid-filled cysticercus. The cyst wall evades immune recognition until the parasite dies and leaks antigens, triggering inflammation. Perilesional edema and local inflammatory response account for seizures and focal deficits. In contrast, echinococcal cysts provoke continuous space-occupying mass effect with minimal inflammation until ruptured.","clinical_manifestation":"Presentation is protean: seizures (70\u201390%), headache (50%), focal deficits (20%), increased intracranial pressure in extraparenchymal disease. Parenchymal cysts cause seizures; subarachnoid forms cause hydrocephalus and headache. Clinical course ranges from acute symptomatic seizures to chronic epileptogenic foci.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI is the most sensitive modality: T2-hyperintense cysts with eccentric scolex (\u201chole with dot\u201d). CT can show calcified nodules. Serology (EITB) has sensitivity ~98% for multiple cysts; specificity ~100%. CSF ELISA may help in racemose forms. Diagnostic criteria combine imaging, serology, clinical features, and epidemiology.","management_principles":"First-line therapy includes albendazole (15 mg/kg/day for 14 days) plus corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Praziquantel (50 mg/kg/day) is an alternative. Steroids (dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg/day) are given 1 day before and during antiparasitic therapy. Antiepileptic drugs are indicated for seizure control. Surgical intervention (ventriculoperitoneal shunt) is reserved for hydrocephalus.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat MRI at 3 and 6 months post-treatment to confirm cyst resolution. Continue AEDs for at least 6 months after last seizure. Monitor for steroid side effects and liver function tests during albendazole therapy. In endemic areas, screen household contacts.","clinical_pearls":"1. Neurocysticercosis is the most common parasitic CNS infection worldwide. 2. Eccentric scolex on MRI is pathognomonic. 3. Albendazole plus steroids reduces lesion burden and seizures. 4. Single enhancing lesion in endemic area often self-resolves. 5.
