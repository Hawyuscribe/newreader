Myotonia\u2014delayed muscle relaxation after contraction\u2014is most classically seen in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (Steinert disease), an autosomal-dominant trinucleotide-repeat disorder of the DMPK gene. Numerous studies (Harper 2009; Meola & Sacconi 2015) report that up to 50% of adult patients develop insulin resistance and frank type II diabetes by middle adulthood. In contrast, hypertension (Option B) is not a defining systemic feature of myotonic dystrophy, though mild autonomic dysfunction may occur. Malignancy (Option C) is not specifically linked to myotonic disorders; while cataracts and testicular atrophy are common, there is no consistent increase in cancer incidence. Osteolytic bone lesions (Option D) are a hallmark of multiple myeloma rather than any myotonic syndrome and are not seen in myotonia congenita or myotonic dystrophy. Common misconceptions include attributing insulin resistance in DM1 purely to lifestyle rather than primary muscle pathology and mistaking hypertensive autonomic findings for core features of myotonia.","conceptual_foundation":"Myotonia refers to a delay in skeletal muscle relaxation. It can be congenital (e.g., myotonia congenita\u2014Thomsen\u2019s and Becker\u2019s diseases) or dystrophic (myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2). In ICD-11 classification, myotonic dystrophy type 1 is coded under muscular dystrophies (8D41), and type 2 under 8D42. The key differential diagnoses include other non-dystrophic myotonias (sodium channel myotonia) and periodic paralyses. Historically, Steinert first described familial myotonia with systemic features in 1909. Embryologically, skeletal muscle arises from somitic mesoderm; chloride channel CLCN1 mutations in non-dystrophic myotonia disrupt membrane repolarization, whereas DMPK expansions in DM1 exert a toxic RNA gain-of-function effect. Neuroanatomically, affected muscles are those with high fast-twitch fiber content. Endocrine involvement (insulin resistance) reflects multisystem involvement rather than pure muscle pathology. Genetically, DM1 involves >50 CTG repeats in the DMPK gene, and repeat length correlates with age at onset and severity.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle relaxation depends on rapid repolarization through chloride conductance. In DM1, expanded CUG repeats in DMPK transcripts sequester muscleblind-like proteins, leading to aberrant splicing of multiple transcripts including CLCN1, insulin receptor (INSR), and troponin T. Reduced CLCN1 leads to membrane hyperexcitability and myotonia. Mis-splicing of INSR results in a higher ratio of fetal (less insulin-sensitive) receptor isoform B, causing peripheral insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Over time, beta-cell compensation may fail, leading to overt type II diabetes. Unlike malignant osteolysis (which involves osteoclast activation by malignant plasma cells), DM1 pathology is mediated by toxic RNA and multi-system spliceopathy. This explains the combination of muscle, endocrine, ocular, and cardiac manifestations unique to DM1.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in adulthood with stiff, cramping muscles\u2014especially grip myotonia in the hands\u2014often requiring a \u2018warm-up\u2019 phenomenon to release the contraction. Approximately 80% develop early posterior subcapsular cataracts by age 40, and 30\u201350% develop insulin resistance; up to 20% progress to type II diabetes by age 50. Cardiac conduction defects (first-degree AV block in 25%, atrial arrhythmias) and gastrointestinal dysmotility are common. Non-dystrophic myotonias present purely with muscle stiffness and lack systemic features. Natural history of DM1 involves progressive muscle weakness, particularly distal limb muscles, with variable severity. Diagnostic criteria (European Neuromuscular Centre 2000) combine clinical myotonia, family history, EMG myotonic discharges, and genetic confirmation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes EMG demonstrating characteristic high-frequency discharges (\u2018dive- bomber\u2019 sound) with myotonic runs (sensitivity ~95%). Plasma CK is normal to mildly elevated. Genetic testing for DMPK CTG repeat expansion confirms diagnosis (gold standard; sensitivity and specificity >99%). Second-tier cardiac evaluation with ECG and Holter monitor is recommended to screen for conduction defects. Endocrine testing includes fasting glucose, HbA1c, and insulin levels to assess insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index). No imaging studies are required to establish myotonia, but MRI may be used to quantify muscle atrophy in research settings.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy for DM1; management is symptomatic and multidisciplinary. For myotonia, mexiletine (200\u2013600 mg daily) is first-line (Class I, Level B evidence; AAN 2012) and reduces myotonic stiffness in ~70% of patients. Alternative agents include lamotrigine or ranolazine. Endocrine management follows ADA guidelines: lifestyle modification, metformin (500\u20132000 mg daily), and escalation to insulin or other oral agents as needed. Cardiac conduction defects may require pacemaker implantation. Cataracts are addressed by ophthalmologic referral. Physical therapy to maintain mobility and avoid falls is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months in a neuromuscular clinic, including EMG if symptoms change. Annual ECG and Holter monitoring to detect conduction delays. Yearly ophthalmology exam for cataract progression. Endocrinology follow-up every 6 months to monitor glycemic control (HbA1c goal <7%). Pulmonary function tests annually to screen for respiratory muscle weakness. Genetic counseling for family planning. Multidisciplinary care including physical therapy and occupational therapy is recommended to optimize function.","clinical_pearls":"1) Myotonia in DM1 often improves with repeated movements (\u2018warm-up\u2019 phenomenon)\u2014helps distinguish from spastic stiffness. 2) Up to 50% of adult DM1 patients have insulin resistance based on glucose tolerance testing\u2014screen early. 3) EMG myotonic discharges have a characteristic waxing and waning frequency\u2014\u2018dive-bomber\u2019 sound with >95% sensitivity. 4) Cardiac conduction defects may be asymptomatic\u2014annual ECG can prevent sudden cardiac death. 5) Cataracts in DM1 are early and posterior subcapsular\u2014consider ophthalmologic screening by age 30.","references":"1.

Cold exposure increases sympathetic activity, shivering, and catecholamine release, which drive potassium into skeletal muscle cells via stimulation of Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase, thereby lowering extracellular potassium and triggering muscle weakness. Options B, C, and D are incorrect: cold does not relieve or prevent attacks, nor is it neutral, as multiple clinical series and physiologic studies have documented cold as a trigger (e.g., Statland et al., 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a channelopathy characterized by episodic muscle weakness associated with low serum potassium. It is classified under neuromuscular disorders (ICD-11 GB34) and is most often autosomal dominant due to CACNA1S or SCN4A mutations. Triggers include rest after exercise, high carbohydrate meals, insulin, catecholamines, and cold. Embryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from paraxial mesoderm; voltage-gated calcium (Cav1.1) and sodium (Nav1.4) channels are integral to excitation\u2013contraction coupling. Disrupted channel function leads to paradoxical depolarization and paralysis during hypokalemia.","pathophysiology":"At baseline, Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase maintains transmembrane ionic gradients. In hypokalemic periodic paralysis, mutant Cav1.1 or Nav1.4 channels allow aberrant cation leak, leading to sustained depolarization when extracellular potassium falls. Cold exposure elevates adrenergic tone and shivering, enhancing Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase activity, driving K\u207a intracellularly. The resultant hypokalemia hyperpolarizes muscle fibers beyond the threshold for action potential generation, causing flaccid paralysis. Other precipitants share this mechanism, whereas cold uniquely combines increased metabolic demand with sympathetic surge.","clinical_manifestation":"Attacks present with sudden onset flaccid weakness, often in proximal muscles, sparing respiratory and bulbar muscles. Episodes typically last hours to days and recur periodically. Triggers such as cold lead to onset within minutes; weakness resolves with potassium repletion. Between attacks, strength is normal. Cardiac arrhythmias may occur during severe hypokalemia.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes serum potassium during an attack, which is low (often <3.0 mEq/L), and ECG monitoring for U waves and arrhythmias. After stabilization, genetic testing for CACNA1S and SCN4A mutations confirms diagnosis. Provocative testing (e.g., glucose\u2013insulin challenge) is now rarely used due to safety concerns. Muscle biopsy and EMG are generally non-specific.","management_principles":"Acute attacks are managed with oral or IV potassium supplementation (e.g., 0.5\u20131.0 mEq/kg orally). Avoidance of triggers, including cold, is recommended. Prophylactic therapy with acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide reduces attack frequency by inducing mild metabolic acidosis and reducing Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase activity. Lifestyle adjustments include warm clothing to minimize cold exposure.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up focuses on monitoring attack frequency, serum electrolytes, and medication side effects. Periodic ECGs assess for arrhythmias. Patients are advised to maintain a warm environment and promptly treat early weakness. Genetic counseling should be offered.","clinical_pearls":"1. Cold exposure is a classic trigger of hypokalemic periodic paralysis due to increased Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase activity. 2. Proximal muscle groups are predominantly affected; respiratory involvement is rare. 3. Acetazolamide prophylaxis works by promoting metabolic acidosis. 4. During attacks, avoid glucose loads that worsen hypokalemia. 5. Genetic testing confirms diagnosis and guides family screening.","references":"1. Statland JM, Fontaine B, Hanna MG, et al.

Options A and B are false because serum potassium levels in periodic paralysis are not universally extreme in every episode or patient\u2014the levels fluctuate and may even normalize between attacks. In hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP), potassium is typically low during attacks but can be normal interictally; it is never high, disproving option C. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP) features elevated potassium during an attack but normal or even low levels at other times, invalidating option B. Option A\u2019s absolute qualifier \u201calways\u201d is misleading, as documented by Statland et al. (2018) who showed up to 15% of HypoPP patients have near-normal potassium during mild attacks. No option accurately captures the clinical variability, making D the only correct choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Periodic paralyses are inherited skeletal muscle channelopathies classified into hypokalemic, hyperkalemic, and Andersen-Tawil syndromes under the ICD-11 code 8E83. HypoPP is most commonly caused by mutations in CACNA1S or SCN4A, leading to aberrant gating pore currents and depolarization-induced inactivation of sodium channels. HyperPP arises from SCN4A gain-of-function mutations, delaying sodium channel inactivation and causing sustained depolarization. Normal interictal potassium homeostasis relies on renal handling (ROMK, Kir channels) and skeletal muscle Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase activity. Between episodes, compensatory upregulation of sodium pumps and shifts in intracellular cation balance maintain normokalemia. Differential diagnoses include thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (a secondary form often seen in Asian men) and Andersen-Tawil syndrome, which also features dysmorphic facies and ventricular arrhythmias due to KCNJ2 mutations. The nosologic evolution traces back to periodic paralysis descriptions in the 19th century and the discovery of channel mutations in the 1990s, refining the taxonomy to genetic channelopathies.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, action potentials in skeletal muscle are propagated by voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. In HypoPP, aberrant gating pore currents through mutated channels lead to a paradoxical leak of cations at resting potential, causing sustained depolarization and inexcitability when extracellular potassium is low. Low serum potassium exacerbates this depolarization by shifting the resting membrane potential farther from threshold. In HyperPP, defective inactivation of sodium channels causes persistent inward sodium currents, depolarizing the membrane especially when serum potassium rises, reducing the transmembrane gradient. Acute attacks are precipitated by shifts in potassium due to carbohydrate loads or rest after exercise (insulin-mediated uptake), while chronic compensations include upregulation of Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase and adjustments in Kir channel expression. Symptoms result when depolarization inactivates sodium channels, preventing action potential generation and yielding flaccid paralysis.","clinical_manifestation":"HypoPP typically presents in adolescence with episodic flaccid weakness lasting hours to days, often following high-carbohydrate meals or rest after exercise. Attacks commonly affect proximal muscles and spare respiratory and bulbar muscles, though severe cases may involve respiratory compromise. Potassium levels during attacks often fall below 3.0 mmol/L but can range from 2.0 to 3.5 mmol/L; interictal levels are usually normal. HyperPP manifests with shorter episodes (minutes to hours) triggered by fasting or rest after exercise; serum potassium during attacks can rise above 5.5 mmol/L but may normalize rapidly, sometimes evading detection. Andersen-Tawil syndrome includes periodic paralysis combined with ventricular arrhythmias (U-waves on ECG) and distinctive facies or skeletal anomalies. Natural history without treatment involves progressive fixed weakness in some HypoPP patients over decades (up to 60% after age 40). Diagnosis relies on attack history, serum electrolytes, ECG changes, and genetic testing.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes serum electrolytes drawn early in an attack\u2014potassium, magnesium, and thyroid function. An ECG may reveal U-waves or prolonged QT in HypoPP and peaked T-waves in HyperPP. Genetic testing (CACNA1S and SCN4A sequencing) confirms diagnosis in over 80% of familial cases (sensitivity ~83%, specificity >95%). Provocative testing (e.g., oral glucose or insulin challenge) is reserved for equivocal cases but carries risk of severe paralysis. Long-exercise and short-exercise tests with repetitive nerve stimulation can differentiate between HypoPP and HyperPP by characteristic decremental or incremental EMG responses. Muscle biopsy is seldom required but can show vacuolar myopathy in Andersen-Tawil syndrome. No single test suffices; a combination of clinical, laboratory, electrophysiologic, and genetic data yields the highest diagnostic accuracy (post-test probability >90% when all modalities align).","management_principles":"Acute HypoPP attacks are treated with oral or intravenous potassium chloride (0.2\u20130.4 mEq/kg), with ECG monitoring to avoid rebound hyperkalemia. HyperPP attacks respond to inhaled salbutamol (2.5\u20135 mg nebulized) or intravenous glucose plus insulin if potassium is elevated. Preventive therapy for HypoPP includes carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide 250\u20131000 mg/day) or dichlorphenamide (50\u2013200 mg/day), which reduce attack frequency by 50\u201370% (Class I, Level A evidence). HyperPP prevention employs thiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide 12.5\u201350 mg/day) to promote renal potassium loss and reduce attacks. Dietary modifications\u2014avoiding high-carbohydrate meals in HypoPP and fasting in HyperPP\u2014are critical. Patients must carry medical alert identification and emergency potassium or salbutamol for self-administration.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up involves periodic electrolyte monitoring and assessment of attack frequency every 3\u20136 months. Long-term acetazolamide therapy warrants yearly ophthalmologic exams for risk of nephrolithiasis and metabolic acidosis. ECG surveillance is recommended annually in Andersen-Tawil syndrome to monitor QT interval and arrhythmia risk. Patients with progressive fixed weakness should be evaluated for rehabilitative interventions and potential complications such as cardiomyopathy. Genetic counseling is advised for family planning. Transition of care from pediatric to adult neuromuscular clinics should occur in late adolescence with a structured handoff covering genotype, medication history, and attack triggers.","clinical_pearls":"1. HypoPP attacks are often triggered by carbohydrate loads\u2014educate patients to limit simple sugars. 2. Acetazolamide reduces attack frequency by inducing mild metabolic acidosis, stabilizing membrane potentials. 3.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["MMN","CIDP","HNPP","HMSN"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"MMN","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Multifocal Motor Neuropathy, MMN) is definitively correct because the patient presents with asymmetric, predominantly distal limb weakness without sensory loss, persistent conduction block on motor nerve conduction studies, and anti-GM1 IgM antibodies in approximately 40\u201370% of cases. MMN incidence is estimated at 0.6 per 100,000 per year, male predominance approximately 2:1. Unlike CIDP, MMN spares sensory fibers in over 95% of patients. Conduction block on at least two motor nerves, persistently unchanged over four weeks, and no significant sensory involvement distinguishes MMN. Option B (Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, CIDP) is incorrect because CIDP usually involves both motor and sensory fibers in more than 80% of cases, with symmetric proximal and distal weakness evolving over at least eight weeks. Sensory symptoms such as tingling and numbness occur in 75\u201385%, CSF protein elevation > 0.45 g/L in 90%. Option C (Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies, HNPP) is incorrect; it is autosomal dominant PMP22 deletion, with recurrent sensory and motor palsies at entrapment sites, often resolving in weeks. Conduction studies show focal slowing at common entrapment sites, not the multifocal motor blocks seen in MMN. Option D (Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy, HMSN; Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) presents with chronic distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, pes cavus, foot drop, and absent or severely reduced sensory nerve action potentials by adolescence, often with PMP22 duplication in 70%. Common misconceptions include equating conduction block with demyelination only; in MMN, immune-mediated focal demyelination selectively targets motor fibers. Studies by Joint Task Force of the EFNS/PNS (2010) support the utility of IVIG in MMN, whereas corticosteroids are ineffective or may worsen symptoms. Current guidelines recommend IVIG 2 g/kg over two to five days as first line, achieving response rates of 70\u201385% in published series.","conceptual_foundation":"Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) involves selective pathology of peripheral motor axons and motor roots without sensory fiber involvement. Anatomically, motor neuron axons arise from anterior horn cells in the spinal cord, extend through ventral roots, plexuses, and peripheral nerves to reach muscle fibers. The key locus of pathology is along the myelinated internodes of motor fibers, especially at proximal and distal segments prone to focal immune-mediated demyelination. Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest cells, with Schwann cell precursors migrating along axons and differentiating into myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells under neuregulin-1 signaling. Normal physiology relies on saltatory conduction across nodes of Ranvier, with voltage-gated sodium channels concentrated at nodes and potassium channels at juxtaparanodal regions. In MMN, autoantibodies against ganglioside GM1 disturb nodal and paranodal integrity. Related conditions include multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (Lewis\u2013Sumner syndrome), acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), and hereditary demyelinating neuropathies. Historically, MMN was first distinguished from motor neuron disease in 1988. Early confusion with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis delayed recognition until conduction block criteria were formalized in the 1990s. Key landmarks include the ventral roots, nerve fascicles, and nodes of Ranvier visible on teased fiber preparations, critical in correlating pathology with clinical conduction block.","pathophysiology":"The molecular basis of MMN centers on IgM autoantibodies directed against GM1 ganglioside concentrated at nodes of Ranvier on motor axons. GM1 binds complement component C1q, triggering classical complement cascade activation and formation of membrane attack complex (MAC) on axolemma. Sublytic MAC deposition perturbs ion channel clustering and nodal architecture. Voltage-gated sodium channel density falls by 30\u201350% locally, slowing conduction and leading to focal conduction block. Inflammatory milieu includes elevated C3b and C4d fragments, with perivascular macrophage infiltration observed on nerve biopsy. Key cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 amplify B cell class switching to IgM. Genetic predisposition may involve HLA-DRB1*15 in 20% versus 10% of controls. There is no clear Mendelian inheritance. The time course spans weeks to months to develop initial demyelinating lesions, with compensatory remyelination by Schwann cells that often leaves thinner myelin sheaths. Repeated cycles result in multifocal conduction deficits without uniform slowing, distinguishing MMN from diffuse demyelinating disorders. Energy requirements for remyelination rise due to increased mitochondrial biogenesis within Schwann cells, but persistent immune attack overwhelms repair. Progressive axonal loss can occur at rates up to 5% per year in untreated patients, limiting long-term prognosis if unmanaged.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present between ages 20 and 60, mean onset around 40 years. Symptom progression unfolds over 2\u201312 months before stabilization. Initial complaint is painless, asymmetric weakness often starting in wrist flexors or finger extensors, leading to wrist drop in 60% and finger extension weakness in 55%. Deep tendon reflexes may be diminished in affected segments; sensory examination is normal in over 95%. Mastoid and facial muscles are rarely involved. Severe cases show shoulder girdle weakness in 10%. Upper limb involvement predominates, but 20% of cases have isolated leg involvement. Pediatric cases are rare (<5%); elderly may have slower progression. Gender ratio male:female approximates 2:1. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue occur in 25%. Severity graded by MRC scale shows Grade 4 weakness in 70% at diagnosis. Red flags include sensory loss or sphincter dysfunction, which argue against MMN. Without treatment, motor units decline by 15% annually, leading to lasting disability. Natural history reveals plateau after two to three years, but residual deficits persist in 80% if untreated. Respiratory or bulbar involvement almost never occurs in pure MMN, unlike motor neuron disease. Rare autonomic dysfunction may be reported but is likely coincidental.","diagnostic_approach":"Step one is clinical suspicion based on asymmetric distal limb weakness without sensory deficits evolving over more than one month. First-line electrophysiological studies include motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude; sensitivity around 80%, specificity 95%. Look for focal conduction blocks defined as >50% CMAP area reduction between proximal and distal stimulation without temporal dispersion. Sensory studies should be normal to exclude sensory involvement. Second-line tests include F-wave persistence and proximal stimulation of ulnar and median nerves. CSF protein is typically normal or mildly elevated (<0.7 g/L in 30% of cases). Anti-GM1 IgM antibody testing yields 50\u201370% sensitivity, 90% specificity. MRI neurography may show T2 hyperintense fascicular enhancement in brachial plexus segments in 40% of patients. Nerve biopsy is reserved for atypical cases, demonstrating multifocal demyelination and inflammatory infiltrates in 20\u201330% of specimens. Differential includes ALS (lack of conduction block, presence of denervation on EMG), CIDP (sensory conduction slowing, symmetric pattern), HNPP (transient focal slowing at entrapment sites and family history), and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (uniform slowing and genetic testing for PMP22 duplication/deletion). Diagnostic criteria per EFNS/PNS guidelines require two definite conduction blocks plus clinical motor-only signs for confirmed MMN.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg divided over two to five days. Typical induction is 0.4 g/kg daily over five days, with response in 70\u201385% within four weeks. Maintenance dosing ranges from 0.4 to 1 g/kg every two to six weeks, adjusted to clinical response and CMAP amplitude recovery of at least 30%. Corticosteroids and plasma exchange are generally ineffective or may worsen weakness. Second-line options include rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks in refractory cases, with 40% achieving modest improvement after three months. Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day oral) is considered if severe progression continues despite IVIG, but carries infertility and infection risks. Non-pharmacological interventions include tailored occupational and physical therapy focusing on task-specific strengthening and splinting to prevent contractures; evidence grade B supports improved functional scores by 20% over six months. Surgical decompression is not routinely indicated. Monitor renal function prior to IVIG (creatinine, eGFR), and watch for infusion-related headaches in 15% and rare thromboembolic events (incidence 0.6%). In pregnancy, IVIG remains safe (Category C) with no teratogenic signals in registry data. Tailor regimens for renal/hepatic impairment by extending infusion time and using lower concentrations to minimize osmotic load.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur every four to six weeks during induction, then every three months once stabilized. At each visit assess muscle strength by MRC grading, functional disability by INCAT score (target <3), and CMAP amplitudes. Repeat electrophysiological studies every six months to monitor new conduction blocks or axonal loss. Laboratory surveillance includes complete blood count, renal panel, and immunoglobulin levels prior to each IVIG cycle. MRI plexus imaging may be repeated annually if clinical deterioration is unexplained. Long-term complications include treatment-related thrombosis (incidence 0.6%) and cumulative axonal loss leading to permanent weakness in 50% at five years. Prognosis: 1-year motor improvement in 75%, 5-year stable functional status in 60%. Engage rehabilitation services within three months for gait training and adaptive devices; begin tapering of maintenance IVIG only after 12 months of stability. Educate patients on infusion side effects, signs of thrombosis, and infection risks. Driving may be resumed when hand strength reaches MRC Grade 4 in both hands. Provide contact information for the GBS/CIDP Foundation International and local support groups for peer assistance.","clinical_pearls":"1. MMN always spares sensory fibers in >95%\u2014sensory loss argues against diagnosis. 2. Conduction block without temporal dispersion is hallmark; temporal dispersion suggests remyelination rather than focal block. 3. Anti-GM1 IgM antibodies positive in ~50%, but absence does not exclude MMN. 4. IVIG at 2 g/kg induction and 0.4\u20131 g/kg maintenance yields 70\u201385% response; corticosteroids can worsen symptoms. 5. Differentiate from ALS: ALS has upper motor signs, widespread denervation on EMG, and no conduction blocks. 6. Mnemonic \u201cMMN = Motor, Multifocal, No sensory, IVIG works\u201d helps recall key features. 7. Recent EFNS/PNS guideline (2010) clarified diagnostic levels A and B. 8. Early treatment prevents irreversible axonal loss; delay beyond six months reduces recovery by 40%. 9. Cost of IVIG approximates $10,000 per infusion cycle; consider cost-effectiveness when planning maintenance intervals. 10. Bedside tips: always test distal and proximal stimulation of median and ulnar nerves bilaterally in any suspected case.","references":"1. Hartung HP, et al.
