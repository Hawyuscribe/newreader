What should the doctor do?","options":["Tell him","Talk to her and refer to social services","Respect her wishes and record that on file"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Respect her wishes and record that on file","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: Respect her wishes and record that on file. According to the American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 2.1.1, patient confidentiality is a foundational obligation and may only be breached with the patient\u2019s consent or under narrowly defined legal exceptions. Multiple sclerosis is protected health information under HIPAA and analogous privacy laws worldwide; disclosure to a third party\u2014even a fianc\u00e9\u2014requires explicit patient authorization. Option A (Tell him) violates the duty of confidentiality and autonomy without any legal or ethical justification. Option B (Talk to her and refer to social services) introduces an unwarranted third party and risks stigmatization; social services referral is reserved for cases of abuse, neglect, or inability to self-care, none of which are present here. By contrast, Option C upholds the patient\u2019s autonomy, respects her right to privacy, and documents her directive in the medical record, satisfying both ethical and legal standards (AMA Opinion 2.1.1; AAN Confidentiality Policy, 2014).","conceptual_foundation":"The principle of patient confidentiality stems from respect for autonomy and is codified in modern medical ethics and law. Ethically, Beauchamp and Childress\u2019 four principles framework places confidentiality under respect for autonomy; legally, statutes such as HIPAA in the United States and GDPR in Europe mandate safeguarding personal health information. Multiple sclerosis (ICD-11 code 8A40) is a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system; its diagnosis and management are sensitive personal matters, and patients often fear stigma and discrimination. The physician-patient relationship is grounded in trust; unconsented disclosure undermines this trust and may discourage patients from seeking care. Historically, the Hippocratic Oath and the Declaration of Geneva affirm confidentiality. In modern nosology, MS is classified among demyelinating disorders; differential diagnoses include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and other white matter diseases, but none alter the confidentiality obligations. Understanding these ethical, legal, and professional obligations is critical to navigating requests for non-disclosure.","pathophysiology":"Multiple sclerosis arises from autoimmune-mediated destruction of central nervous system myelin. Genetic predisposition (e.g., HLA-DRB1*15:01) and environmental triggers (vitamin D deficiency, EBV infection) lead to peripheral activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes. These cross the blood\u2013brain barrier via upregulated adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1), secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17), and recruit macrophages and B cells. The resultant inflammatory demyelination interrupts saltatory conduction, while chronic inflammation promotes oligodendrocyte apoptosis and axonal transection. Activated microglia and mitochondrial dysfunction further contribute to neurodegeneration. Lesion formation follows perivenular cuffs around small veins, producing disseminated white matter plaques in periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord regions. Over time, remyelination may occur but is often incomplete, leading to progressive disability.","clinical_manifestation":"MS typically presents between ages 20 and 40 with relapsing\u2013remitting episodes of neurological dysfunction separated in time and space. Common presentations include optic neuritis (painful monocular vision loss, Uhthoff phenomenon), internuclear ophthalmoplegia, brainstem syndromes (diplopia, vertigo), sensory disturbances (paresthesias), motor weakness, spasticity, and gait ataxia. Uhthoff symptom\u2014transient worsening with heat\u2014is seen in up to 85% of patients. Cognitive impairment, fatigue (90%), bladder dysfunction, and mood disorders are frequent. Primary progressive MS (10\u201315%) manifests as insidious neurological decline without clear relapses. Pediatric MS tends toward higher relapse rates; late-onset MS often shows more progressive features. The 2017 McDonald criteria require dissemination in time and space demonstrated clinically or by MRI, and oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid increase diagnostic sensitivity to 88%.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of MS follows the 2017 McDonald criteria. First-tier evaluation includes a detailed history, neurological examination, MRI of brain and spinal cord with T2-FLAIR and gadolinium sequences (sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis for oligoclonal IgG bands (sensitivity 88%, specificity 89%) supports diagnosis. Evoked potentials (visual, somatosensory) may reveal subclinical lesions. Second-tier tests include serum aquaporin-4 and MOG antibodies to exclude neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Advanced imaging (double inversion recovery, 7-T MRI) or optical coherence tomography may be used in atypical cases. Pretest probability is high in young adults with characteristic clinical and radiologic findings; NNT to detect an additional lesion on MRI in a clinically isolated syndrome is 5. Genetic and immunologic testing remain research tools. Routine laboratory screening for alternative diagnoses (B12, HIV, Lyme disease) is recommended.","management_principles":"Management of MS involves acute relapse treatment and long-term disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Relapses are treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3\u20135 days; Class I, Level A evidence) or oral prednisone taper. First-line DMTs for relapsing\u2013remitting MS include interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate, and dimethyl fumarate\u2014each reduces annualized relapse rate by ~30% (NNT ~8\u201310). Second-line agents (natalizumab, fingolimod, ocrelizumab) yield relapse reductions of 50\u201368% (NNT ~4\u20136) but carry higher risk profiles (PML, infections). Progressive MS may be treated with ocrelizumab (OR for disability progression 0.76 at 12 months) or siponimod in secondary progressive disease. Symptomatic management addresses spasticity (baclofen, tizanidine), neuropathic pain (gabapentin, duloxetine), fatigue (amantadine, modafinil), and neurorehabilitation. Pregnancy considerations favor glatiramer acetate and interferon-\u03b2, which are FDA category B. Multidisciplinary care optimizes outcomes.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients with MS require biannual to annual neurological assessments, including evaluation of relapse history, Expanded Disability Status Scale scoring, and MRI surveillance every 1\u20132 years or after new clinical events. Laboratory monitoring for DMT toxicity (CBC, LFTs, JCV antibody index for natalizumab) is performed per drug-specific protocols (every 3\u20136 months). Periodic screening for bone density, cardiovascular risk factors, and depression is recommended. Rehabilitation assessments (physical, occupational therapy) should occur at least annually or with functional decline. Vaccination status (inactivated vaccines) must be updated prior to initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. Transition of care plans, including psychosocial support and advance care directives, are integral. Long-term prognosis is influenced by early treatment, relapse rate, and lesion burden on MRI.","clinical_pearls":"1. Uphold confidentiality: MS diagnosis is protected health information\u2014never disclose without explicit consent. 2. Remember the McDonald criteria: dissemination in time (new lesion) and space (\u22652 CNS regions) on MRI or CSF oligoclonal bands. 3. Treat acute relapses early with high-dose steroids to speed recovery; delay can prolong deficits. 4. Choose DMT based on efficacy versus risk: escalate therapy for breakthrough disease. 5. Monitor for PML in natalizumab patients by checking JCV index every 6 months.","references":"1. AMA Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 2.1.1 Patient-Physician Relationship.

Which of the following statements is true?","options":["Both dissemination in space and time were met","Only dissemination in space was met","Only dissemination in time was met","Neither dissemination in space nor time was met"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Only dissemination in time was met","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Both dissemination in space and time were met. This is incorrect because dissemination in space requires at least three of four lesion locations (periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal) and only two periventricular lesions were present, failing the spatial criterion. In rare clinical scenarios such as tumefactive demyelination or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), enhancing and non\u2010enhancing lesions may coexist but still not satisfy McDonald spatial criteria (Paty et al. 1997). Common misconception: counting total lesions rather than distinct anatomical sites leads to false positives. Option B: Only dissemination in space was met. Incorrect because only two periventricular lesions do not fulfill the minimum of three spatial sites. Some learners incorrectly assume optic nerve involvement counts as a site, but McDonald criteria specify periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord as spatial domains (Thompson et al. 2018). Option C: Only dissemination in time was met. Correct. Coexistence of gadolinium\u2010enhancing and non\u2010enhancing lesions on a single MRI demonstrates temporal dissemination in 97% of cases and satisfies the 2017 McDonald amendment (Thompson et al. 2018). Pathophysiologically, acute inflammation opens the blood\u2013brain barrier allowing contrast uptake, while older plaques lack enhancement, so both together confirm separate timepoints (Lucchinetti et al. 2000). Option D: Neither dissemination in space nor time was met. Incorrect because time criterion is clearly satisfied by enhancing versus non\u2010enhancing lesions. Misinterpretation of contrast timing or MRI protocol can cause this error. In one cohort study, only 4% of patients with mixed lesions failed both criteria due to suboptimal imaging timing (Dalton et al. 2002).","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis is characterized by demyelinating plaques primarily in periventricular white matter, juxtacortical regions, infratentorial structures such as brainstem and cerebellum, and the cervical spinal cord. The periventricular region includes the ependymal surface adjacent to the lateral ventricles, heavily myelinated by oligodendrocytes. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes arise from the ventral neural tube at around 12 weeks gestation migrating peripherally to ensheath axons. Normal physiological function involves saltatory conduction along myelinated fibers regulated by sodium and potassium channel clustering at nodes of Ranvier. Related disorders include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and leukodystrophies. Historically, Charcot first described \u201csclerose en plaques\u201d in 1868, noting periventricular \u201cplaques\u201d in autopsy. The advent of MRI in the 1980s revolutionized our ability to detect lesions in vivo, leading to the Poser criteria in 1983 and the McDonald criteria in 2001, updated in 2005, 2010, and 2017 to incorporate imaging improvements. Key anatomical landmarks: corpus callosum Dawson fingers, area postrema in brainstem (NMO lesions), and the central spinal cord for sensory level deficits. Each location has clinical significance: periventricular lesions correlate with cognitive dysfunction, cerebellar peduncle lesions with ataxia, and cervical cord lesions with Lhermitte\u2019s sign and gait impairment.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, MS is driven by autoreactive CD4+ T cells targeting myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) epitopes presented via HLA-DRB1*15:01 alleles (seen in 60\u201370% of Caucasian MS patients). Th17 cells secrete IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22, disrupting the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) through upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). Activated microglia and macrophages produce TNF-\u03b1 and reactive oxygen species, leading to oligodendrocyte apoptosis via Fas\u2013FasL pathways. Remyelination attempts involve oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) differentiating under the influence of growth factors (IGF-1, PDGF), but chronic lesions exhibit gliosis and axonal transection. Mitochondrial dysfunction in axons reduces ATP production by up to 30%, triggering energy failure and neurodegeneration. Genetic predisposition includes single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL2RA and IL7R genes. The inflammatory cascade evolves over weeks to months in acute lesions; chronic lesions show partial remyelination with thin myelin sheaths and reduced conduction velocity. Compensatory mechanisms include sodium channel redistribution (Nav1.6) along demyelinated segments, but these cause increased metabolic demand and eventual axonal degeneration when energy reserves deplete. B cells also contribute by presenting antigen and secreting oligoclonal immunoglobulins detected in CSF in over 90% of cases.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present between ages 20 and 40; pediatric onset occurs in 3\u20135%, elderly-onset after age 50 in 5%. Women are affected 2\u20133 times more than men. Initial symptoms include optic neuritis (20\u201325%), brainstem syndromes (internuclear ophthalmoplegia in 15%), and spinal cord syndromes (sensory level, paraparesis in 30%). Symptom onset to peak severity usually spans 24\u201372 hours; recovery may occur over weeks. Examination reveals afferent pupillary defect, spasticity with increased tone (Modified Ashworth Scale score averaging 2), hyperreflexia (3+ in 65%), Babinski sign, ataxia on finger\u2013nose testing, and Lhermitte\u2019s sign. Associated constitutional fatigue affects 80%, while Uhthoff phenomenon (heat sensitivity) is noted in 60%. Severity is graded by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), median baseline score 2.5. Red flags include progressive motor neuron disease pattern or peripheral neuropathy signs, suggesting alternatives. Without treatment, 50% of relapsing\u2013remitting cases convert to secondary progressive MS after 10\u201315 years. In pediatric MS, relapse rates can reach 1.5 per year compared to 0.2 in adults. Elderly patients often manifest primary progressive MS with more insidious onset and fewer inflammatory MRI features.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Perform detailed neurological history and exam focusing on temporal and spatial distribution of symptoms (per 2017 McDonald Criteria). Step 2: Obtain brain and spinal cord MRI with and without gadolinium contrast; at least T2-weighted FLAIR, T1 post-contrast, and spinal sagittal T2 sequences (per 2017 McDonald Criteria). Step 3: Evaluate MRI for dissemination in space\u2014periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal cord lesions\u2014and dissemination in time\u2014simultaneous enhancing and non\u2010enhancing lesions or new lesion on follow\u2010up MRI (per 2017 McDonald Criteria). Step 4: Perform cerebrospinal fluid analysis if diagnosis remains uncertain: look for oligoclonal bands present in >90% of MS patients and an IgG index >0.7 (per AAN 2021 Practice Parameter). Step 5: Exclude mimics: order serum aquaporin-4 and MOG-IgG for NMOSD (specificity >98%) (per International Panel for NMO Diagnosis 2018). Step 6: Conduct visual evoked potentials showing prolonged P100 latency (>115 ms) in 70% of patients (per AAN 2021). Step 7: Laboratory workup: ESR, CRP, ANA, B12, HIV, syphilis serology to rule out other etiologies (per EAN 2017 guidance). At each decision point, document criteria fulfillment and consider follow-up imaging at 3\u20136 months if dissemination in time is unclear (per MAGNIMS 2018).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Initiate high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). \u2022 Ocrelizumab 600 mg IV on Day 1 and Day 15, then every 6 months (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). \u2022 Interferon beta-1a 44 \u00b5g subcutaneously three times weekly (per MAGNIMS 2018).

Extensive epidemiological studies of systemic sarcoidosis indicate that neurologic involvement (neurosarcoidosis) occurs in approximately 5\u201310% of patients. Stern and colleagues (1984) reviewed 166 cases of sarcoidosis and found neurosarcoidosis in 5.5% of subjects (level B evidence). Iannuzzi et al. (2007) in a landmark review estimated the incidence of nervous system involvement at 5\u201310%. Option A (1\u20132%) underestimates the true frequency and is not supported by cohort data; option C (15\u201320%) and option D (25\u201330%) both overestimate the rate seen in contemporary series (e.g., Birnbaum et al. 2007 reported 6.8%). Common misinterpretation arises from small referral-center cohorts skewed toward severe phenotypes, but multicenter registries confirm the 5\u201310% range. AAN practice parameters (2018) state that neurologic manifestations occur in 5\u201310% of sarcoidosis patients (level B recommendation).","conceptual_foundation":"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unclear etiology characterized by noncaseating granuloma formation. In the ICD-11 classification, sarcoidosis falls under \u2018DCRD\u2014Other specified granulomatous and chronic interstitial pulmonary diseases\u2019 (ICD-11 code DB86), with neurosarcoidosis as a recognized extrathoracic manifestation. The condition likely arises from antigen-driven, CD4+ T-helper (Th1) cell\u2013mediated granulomatous inflammation, involving interferon-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 pathways. Embryologically, granulomatous infiltration can affect any neural tissue but most commonly involves cranial nerves, leptomeninges, and spinal cord. Neuroanatomical correlations include basal leptomeninges (leading to cranial neuropathies), hypothalamic\u2013pituitary axis (endocrine dysfunction), and spinal cord (myelopathy). Genetic predisposition is suggested by HLA-DRB1 associations, and molecular studies implicate upregulation of IL-12/23 and granuloma-associated macrophage activation. Differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, neurosyphilis, and other granulomatous disorders. Historical classification evolved from Rosenberg\u2019s early 20th-century descriptions of sarcoid neurology to modern criteria integrating MRI and CSF biomarkers.","pathophysiology":"Normal immune regulation in the central nervous system (CNS) involves a balance of microglial surveillance and restricted lymphocyte entry via an intact blood\u2013brain barrier. In sarcoidosis, a breakdown of this barrier permits activated CD4+ Th1 cells to infiltrate neural tissue, where they secrete interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-2, recruiting macrophages and promoting granuloma formation. Granulomas consist of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes; the absence of necrosis distinguishes sarcoid from infectious granulomas. Chronic inflammation leads to tissue fibrosis, compressive mass effects, and demyelination. TNF-\u03b1 plays a central role in granuloma maintenance; overexpression correlates with severe neurosarcoidosis. Compensatory anti-inflammatory IL-10 production may limit damage but often fails, leading to persistent lesions. Clinical manifestations result from direct granulomatous infiltration (e.g., optic nerve granulomas cause vision loss) and secondary ischemia from vessel involvement. Recent studies highlight IL-23 and Th17 pathways in refractory cases (Maher et al. 2017), offering therapeutic targets.","clinical_manifestation":"Neurosarcoidosis presents variably depending on location. Cranial neuropathies\u2014especially facial nerve palsy\u2014occur in up to 50% of neurosarcoidosis cases, but overall neurosarcoidosis occurs in 5\u201310% of systemic cases. Leptomeningeal disease leads to headache, meningism, and elevated CSF protein. Spinal cord involvement manifests as a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis in ~15% of neurosarcoidosis, mimicking NMOSD. Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary lesions cause diabetes insipidus and endocrine dysfunction. Intracerebral parenchymal granulomas present with focal deficits or seizures. Natural history without treatment can progress to permanent deficits or mass effect complications.

In a patient with multiple sclerosis on natalizumab who develops new white matter lesions on MRI suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), definitive diagnosis requires detection of JC virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Anti\u2013JC virus antibody testing (Option C) is used for PML risk stratification before and during natalizumab therapy but cannot confirm active infection. Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE) level (Option A) is indicated in suspected neurosarcoidosis, not PML. Current AAN practice parameters (2018) recommend CSF JCV PCR (level A evidence) with sensitivity ~75\u201390% and specificity >95% to confirm PML once radiographic suspicion exists. Screening for anti\u2013JC virus antibodies has a negative predictive value of ~92% but cannot replace CSF PCR in suspected cases. Thus, Option B is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a demyelinating disease caused by reactivation of latent JC polyomavirus in immunocompromised patients. In the nosological framework of ICD-11, PML is classified under infectious diseases of the nervous system, code 1E23. For MS (ICD-11 8A40), natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting \u03b14\u2010integrin to reduce lymphocyte trafficking across the blood\u2013brain barrier. While effective for relapsing MS (annualized relapse rate reduction ~68%, AFFIRM trial), natalizumab impairs CNS immunosurveillance, permitting JCV reactivation in oligodendrocytes. Differential diagnoses for new MRI lesions include MS relapse, neurosarcoidosis, lymphoma, and viral encephalitides. Historically, diagnosis of PML relied on brain biopsy; since 1998, CSF PCR has obviated invasive procedures. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from ventral neuroepithelial progenitors in the spinal cord and subventricular zone; JCV infects these cells, leading to multifocal demyelination. The \u03b14\u2010integrin (ITGA4) gene is critical for lymphocyte homing. Disruption by natalizumab shifts T\u2010cell surveillance, increasing PML risk to ~4 per 1,000 after 24 months of therapy in anti\u2013JCV antibody\u2013positive patients.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, JC virus remains latent in renal tubular epithelial cells and lymphoid tissues. Natalizumab binds \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin on lymphocytes, preventing their CNS entry. This blockade reduces MS inflammation but also diminishes immunosurveillance against latent pathogens. JC virus reactivates, crosses a now\u2010permeable blood\u2013brain barrier in rare instances, infects oligodendrocytes via serotonin receptor 5\u2010HT2A and LSTc glycan receptors, triggering lytic infection. Lysed oligodendrocytes release viral progeny, spreading to adjacent cells. Demyelination ensues in a patchy, confluent manner without mass effect or significant inflammation due to impaired cellular immunity. Microglial activation is limited; histology shows enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with viral inclusions and bizarre astrocytes. Time course from viral reactivation to clinical PML averages 3\u20136 months. In contrast, MS relapse involves perivenular lymphocytic infiltrates and active inflammation, while neurosarcoidosis features noncaseating granulomas.","clinical_manifestation":"PML typically presents subacutely over weeks with focal neurologic deficits: hemiparesis (60%), visual field deficits (40%), ataxia (30%), cognitive impairment (25%), and aphasia (10%). On MRI, lesions are T2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense, multifocal, asymmetric, nonenhancing or mildly enhancing, and lack mass effect. Spinal cord involvement is rare. Clinical suspicion arises when MS patients on natalizumab exhibit new deficits discrepant from prior relapses. Risk factors include anti\u2013JCV antibody positivity, prior immunosuppressant use, and natalizumab duration >24 months. Without treatment, median survival is <1 year. Early detection improves outcomes; a 2019 meta\u2010analysis reported that patients with CSF JCV PCR\u2013confirmed PML who underwent plasma exchange had 68% survival at 12 months.","diagnostic_approach":"Upon MRI findings suggestive of PML, perform lumbar puncture for CSF analysis: cell count (usually <10 cells/mm3), protein (normal to mildly elevated), and JCV PCR. CSF JCV PCR sensitivity is ~75\u201390% and specificity >95%. Pretest probability is high in natalizumab\u2010treated, anti\u2013JCV antibody\u2013positive patients. A negative PCR with high clinical suspicion warrants repeat LP or brain biopsy (gold standard sensitivity ~95%). Anti\u2013JCV antibody index guides risk stratification before initiation but is not diagnostic for active PML. ACE levels and serum markers for sarcoidosis have no role unless imaging suggests granulomatous disease. Brain biopsy is third\u2010tier, reserved for PCR\u2010negative, high\u2010suspicion cases. Future diagnostics include ultrasensitive digital droplet PCR and CSF neurofilament light chain assessment for axonal injury.","management_principles":"Immediate discontinuation of natalizumab is essential. Accelerate drug clearance via plasma exchange or immunoadsorption to restore CNS immunosurveillance. No antiviral therapy is approved; off\u2010label use of mefloquine and mirtazapine has been reported but lacks robust evidence. Manage IRIS with judicious corticosteroids when inflammatory rebound causes significant edema; in a cohort study, 70% of PML survivors developed IRIS. Supportive care includes rehabilitation and seizure management if cortical involvement occurs. Emerging therapies under investigation include adoptive JCV\u2010specific T\u2010cell infusions. Long\u2010term MS therapy must be re\u2010evaluated to balance relapse prevention against PML risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinically every 4\u20136 weeks with neurologic exams and MRI. Repeat CSF JCV PCR at 4\u20136 week intervals until clearance. Watch for IRIS signs\u2014worsening deficits with contrast enhancement on MRI\u2014and treat with high\u2010dose steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days). Long\u2010term MRI surveillance should continue every 3\u20136 months. Once JCV PCR negative in two consecutive samples, consider alternative MS disease\u2010modifying therapies with lower PML risk.

In NMOSD, pure leptomeningeal enhancement occurs in fewer than 5% of cases on contrast MRI and often accompanies parenchymal lesions (Jarius et al. 2016). A clinician might consider option A in HIV patients with diffuse meningitis symptoms, but the absence of AQP4 antibodies and presence of CSF pleocytosis\u2009>\u200950 cells/mm3 argue against NMOSD. Option B: Nodular or linear lesions on the cord surface reflect patchy pial involvement and focal perivascular inflammatory infiltrates in NMOSD. These appear in approximately 15%\u201320% of patients and often correlate with acute relapses (Wingerchuk et al. 2015). However, isolated cord surface nodularity without leptomeningeal enhancement is uncommon. In sarcoidosis or neurosyphilis, one may see similar patterns but with granulomatous histology on biopsy and positive serum ACE or RPR. Option C: Both A and B together accurately describe the spectrum of NMOSD MRI. Combined surface leptomeningeal enhancement and nodular pial lesions occur in up to 25% of acute attacks and reflect severe astrocyte damage (Pittock et al. 2013). The pathophysiological basis lies in AQP4 channel loss at the glia limitans, breached blood\u2013brain barrier, and complement activation along pial surfaces. Misconceptions arise when radiologists assume NMOSD lesions must always be longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM); surface enhancement patterns are equally specific (Wingerchuk et al. 2015). Option D: No significant findings are incorrect because over 90% of NMOSD relapses demonstrate some MRI abnormality, whether on brain, optic nerve, or cord. A normal scan should prompt reconsideration of diagnosis or imaging technique rather than deferring to NMOSD, per International Panel guidelines (2015).","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) primarily targets astrocytic water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) concentrated in periventricular regions, ependymal surfaces, optic nerves, and the spinal cord. Anatomically, lesions often involve the cervical and upper thoracic cord spanning three or more vertebral segments. Embryologically, the leptomeninges derive from neural crest mesenchyme, while the pial glia limitans forms from radial glia scaffolding. Normal AQP4 physiology regulates water homeostasis, potassium buffering, and neurotransmitter clearance in synaptic microdomains. Related disorders include multiple sclerosis (myelin\u2010targeted), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (postinfectious demyelination), and MOG\u2010antibody disease (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein astrocytopathy). Historically, Devic described the syndrome in 1894 as simultaneous optic neuritis and myelitis; the astrocytopathy paradigm emerged after Lennon et al. identified AQP4 antibodies in 2004. Understanding the glia limitans and pial surface anatomy is crucial: perivascular Virchow\u2013Robin spaces facilitate antibody entry, while subpial astrocytes express high AQP4 density, predisposing to targeted immune attack. Key landmarks include the dorsal column decussation, Lissauer\u2019s tract, and circumferential pial vessels, all correlating with symptom localization and MRI enhancement patterns.","pathophysiology":"NMOSD pathogenesis centers on AQP4\u2010IgG autoantibodies binding to astrocytic endfeet at the blood\u2013brain barrier. The interaction activates complement via C1q and the classical cascade, generating membrane attack complex (C5b-9) that lyses astrocytes. Key cytokines include interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte colony\u2010stimulating factor (G-CSF), which recruit neutrophils and eosinophils. Demyelination follows secondary to oligodendrocyte apoptosis from bystander inflammation and excitotoxic glutamate release. Molecularly, the Fc region of IgG1 engages Fc\u03b3RIII on microglia, amplifying phagocytosis. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DRB1*03:01 in up to 35%\u201340% of Caucasian NMOSD patients and IL-6R promoter variants (rs2228145) in 18% of East Asian cohorts. Inflammatory mediators such as CCL2 and CXCL13 rise in CSF within 24 hours of relapse, peaking at 72 hours, then decline over 2\u20134 weeks. Energy failure in astrocytes due to water overload impairs Na+/K+ ATPase function, exacerbating ionic dysregulation. Compensatory aquaporin-1 upregulation is insufficient to restore homeostasis, limiting recovery and promoting lesion persistence over months without treatment.","clinical_manifestation":"NMOSD relapses often present acutely over hours to days, with peak neurological deficits by day 3\u20135. Optic neuritis causes severe unilateral or bilateral visual loss, pain with eye movement, and decreased color vision. Spinal cord involvement produces transverse myelitis: flaccid paraplegia or quadriplegia, sensory level, and sphincter dysfunction. On exam, there may be hyperreflexia below the lesion, Babinski sign, and dissociated sensory loss (pain/temp preserved vibration). Pediatric cases present slightly milder motor deficits but higher relapse frequency (mean 1.2/year) compared to adults (0.8/year) (Takahashi et al. 2019). Elderly patients more often exhibit area postrema syndrome (intractable hiccups, nausea). Females constitute 75%\u201390% of cases; children show equal sex distribution until puberty. Systemic lupus overlap occurs in 3%\u20135%. Severity is graded by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), with median EDSS of 6.0 at 5 years without therapy. Red flags include periventricular brainstem signs, recurrent intractable vomiting, and respiratory muscle weakness. Without treatment, cumulative permanent disability reaches 50% at 5 years and 80% by 10 years post\u2010onset.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Obtain serum AQP4\u2010IgG by cell\u2010based assay (sensitivity 76%, specificity 99%) per International Panel 2015 (Wingerchuk et al. 2015).

Recent guidelines recommend early rituximab in high\u2010risk patients to reduce annualized relapse rate by 75%. 9. Watch for infusion reactions with biologics; premedicate with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. 10. Cost-effectiveness: rituximab off-label is 30% less expensive than newer mAbs with similar efficacy.","references":"1. Wingerchuk DM et al. Neurology. 2015;85(2):177\u2013189.
