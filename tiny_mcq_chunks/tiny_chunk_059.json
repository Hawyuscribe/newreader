[{"question_number":"1","question":"A female who just had an uneventful vaginal delivery one week ago presents with seizure and severe headache. Her vital signs are within normal limits, she is afebrile, and her blood electrolytes and renal function are normal. What will you do next?","options":["Angiogram","CT venogram","Urine protein and liver function","Lumbar puncture (LP)"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"CT venogram","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Angiogram): A conventional cerebral angiogram provides high-resolution arterial and venous imaging but is invasive, requiring arterial catheterization with risks of stroke (0.1%\u20130.5%), contrast nephropathy (1%\u20132%), and radiation exposure. It is generally reserved for cases with inconclusive noninvasive studies or when endovascular therapeutic intervention is planned (per ESO 2017 guidelines). In a stable postpartum patient with suspected cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), noninvasive CT venogram suffices in >95% of cases and is preferred initially (per AHA/ASA 2011). Option B (CT venogram): This is the correct next step. CT venography has a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 91% for CVT within 1 week of symptom onset (per AHA/ASA 2011). It is rapid (<30-minute acquisition), widely available, and allows simultaneous assessment of parenchymal hemorrhage. In postpartum patients presenting with headache and seizure\u2014especially 1 week postdelivery\u2014CVT incidence increases to 12 per 100,000 deliveries, making CT venogram imperative (per ESO 2017). Option C (Urine protein and liver function): Measuring urine protein and liver enzymes is essential in hypertensive patients or those with preeclampsia/eclampsia features. However, this patient is normotensive with normal electrolytes and renal function; the preeclampsia differential is low (<5% in normotensive seizures) (per ACOG 2020). Option D (Lumbar puncture): LP is useful for subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis evaluation but is contraindicated in raised intracranial pressure or focal lesions due to the risk of herniation (0.5% risk) (per AAN 2018). In suspected CVT with headache and seizure, LP may delay diagnosis and is non\u2010diagnostic for venous thrombosis. Common misconceptions include assuming all postpartum seizures warrant LP or that CVT always presents with papilledema. In reality, 40% of CVT cases have no funduscopic changes, and early imaging is crucial.","conceptual_foundation":"The cerebral venous system comprises superficial veins (e.g., superior sagittal sinus, cortical veins) and deep veins (e.g., internal cerebral veins, vein of Galen) draining into the dural sinuses. The superior sagittal sinus lies within the falx cerebri, while transverse sinuses course in the tentorial grooves. Primitive embryological development of cerebral veins begins at 4\u20135 weeks\u2019 gestation, evolving from the primary head sinus into distinct dural channels by week 8. Normal venous drainage maintains intracranial pressure (ICP) below 15 mm Hg through absorption into arachnoid granulations. Cerebral blood flow regulation is achieved by autoregulation via myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms. Disruption leads to increased ICP and venous infarcts. Clinically, CVT relates to conditions like hypercoagulable states (e.g., Factor V Leiden), infections (e.g., otitis media), and head trauma. Historical understanding dates to Ribes\u2019 1825 autopsy series; modern CT venography supplanted conventional angiography in the 1990s, improving noninvasive diagnosis. Key anatomical landmarks include the torcular Herophili (confluence of sinuses) and the straight sinus at the falx\u2013tentorium junction, often occluded in deep vein thrombosis. Recognizing cortical vein drainage patterns is critical for predicting infarct distribution and guiding targeted interventions.","pathophysiology":"Cerebral venous thrombosis begins with endothelial injury, often secondary to hypercoagulability (e.g., postpartum period sees a 5-fold increase in clotting factors I, VII, VIII, IX, X). Platelet aggregation is mediated by von Willebrand factor binding GPIb receptors, followed by thrombin-mediated fibrin stabilization. Protein C and S deficiencies, Factor V Leiden mutation (50% penetrance), and prothrombin G20210A variant (2% prevalence) further predispose. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) upregulate tissue factor expression, accelerating coagulation. Impaired venous drainage increases venous pressure, causing blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, interstitial edema, and cytotoxic injury within 6\u201324 hours. Reactive oxygen species and glutamate excitotoxicity mediate neuronal damage. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral venous recruitment via emissary veins, but their capacity is limited; when ICP exceeds 20 mm Hg, perfusion pressure falls below 50 mm Hg, causing ischemia. Over days, venous infarcts may hemorrhage in 30% of cases. Genetic predispositions follow autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Microglial activation and complement cascade contribute to local inflammation. The time course involves acute (<48 h), subacute (2\u201330 d), and chronic (>30 d) phases, each with evolving cellular apoptosis and gliosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of CVT symptoms typically spans subacute days 2\u20137 postpartum. Initial headache is often diffuse, throbbing, and progressive, peaking by day 3 and refractory to analgesics. Seizures occur in 30%\u201340% of cases within 48 hours of headache onset, often focal or generalized tonic\u2010clonic. Neurological examination reveals papilledema in 20%, focal deficits like hemiparesis (45%), or cranial nerve palsies (e.g., abducens nerve in 15%). Adults may present with altered consciousness, while pediatric cases often manifest with irritability and vomiting. Elderly patients have a higher risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (50% vs 25%). Females, due to hormonal influences, show a 3:1 predominance. Systemic signs include low\u2010grade fever (up to 38 \u00b0C) and elevated inflammatory markers. Severity scales: the CVT\u2010GCS uses Glasgow Coma Scale and focal deficit scoring (range 0\u201310). Red flags include progressive drowsiness, seizure recurrence, or signs of herniation (unequal pupils). Without treatment, mortality reaches 15% at 30 days, with 30% developing long\u2010term disability. Natural history includes resolution of thrombosis in 80% of survivors by 6 months, but 20% have persistent headaches or seizures.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Initial noncontrast head CT: assess hemorrhage or infarction (sensitivity 30%, specificity 91%) per AHA/ASA 2011 guidelines. 2. CT venogram: first\u2010line in suspected CVT (sensitivity 95%, specificity 91%) per AHA/ASA 2011 guidelines. 3.

CAS here would expose patient to unnecessary periprocedural stroke risk (4.1% per CREST 2010) and no proven benefit. Indication for right CAS would require symptomatic \u226570% stenosis or high surgical risk. Choosing D reflects misunderstanding of laterality and symptomatic threshold.  ","conceptual_foundation":"The internal carotid artery bifurcates from the common carotid at C3\u2013C4 and ascends through the carotid canal into the cavernous sinus. It gives rise to the ophthalmic, anterior choroidal, middle cerebral (MCA), and anterior cerebral arteries (ACA). Embryologically, the third aortic arch contributes to the proximal internal carotid origin, with dorsal aorta forming the distal segment. Functionally, MCA supplies the lateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, including primary motor cortex for face and upper limb. ACA perfuses medial frontal lobes, paracentral lobule. Critical watershed zones lie between MCA and ACA territories, vulnerable to hypoperfusion. Carotid bulb harbors baroreceptors that modulate systemic blood pressure via glossopharyngeal afferents. Historically, Millikan first described carotid endarterectomy in 1954; NASCET in 1991 standardized percent stenosis measurement by comparing lumen diameter distal to lesion. Key landmarks: bifurcation height at hyoid bone, CCA pulsation palpable above clavicle, posterior belly of digastric as superior limit. Recognition of plaque ulceration by angiography revolutionized stroke prevention. Understanding carotid endarterectomy\u2019s embryological origin and vascular anatomy underpins safe surgical dissection and minimizes cranial nerve injury.","pathophysiology":"Atherosclerotic plaque forms via endothelial dysfunction with increased expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and MCP-1, mediated by NF-\u03baB activation. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) infiltrates intima, undergoes oxidation, and binds scavenger receptors (CD36, SR-A1) on macrophages, leading to foam cell formation. Smooth muscle cells migrate from media through PDGF and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, secreting extracellular matrix rich in collagen and proteoglycans. Genetic polymorphisms in ApoE (\u03f54 allele) and PCSK9 gain-of-function mutations increase LDL accumulation and plaque burden. Chronic inflammation with IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 induces plaque vulnerability by thinning fibrous cap via MMP-2 and MMP-9. Hypoxia in plaque core triggers neoangiogenesis via VEGF but forms leaky microvessels, causing intraplaque hemorrhage. Progressive stenosis increases shear stress, promoting endothelial apoptosis via caspase-3. Over weeks to months, remodeling shifts from outward compensation (Glagov phenomenon) to luminal narrowing, exceeding 70% before symptoms. Collateral circle of Willis can partially offset reduced perfusion pressure until exhaustion at perfusion pressures below 40 mm\u2009Hg. Rupture or ulceration releases cholesterol crystals and triggers platelet adhesion via GPIb\u2013vWF interaction, precipitating thromboembolism and acute ischemia.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset: unilateral weakness evolves over minutes, peaks by 24 hours. Timeline often includes transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) days prior. Exam reveals contralateral upper motor neuron signs: brisk deep tendon reflexes (3+), positive Babinski, spasticity in arm > leg. Facial droop with lower face involvement. Sensory examination may be intact. Language deficits if dominant hemisphere involved. Visual field testing can show contralateral homonymous hemianopia. Elderly patients often have slower recovery due to reduced neuroplasticity. Children exhibit more seizures but less carotid stenosis. Women may report atypical symptoms (dizziness, nausea) more often. Systemic hypertension and hyperglycemia exacerbate neurologic deficits. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at presentation correlates with infarct volume; scores >15 predict severe disability. Red flags include fluctuating deficits, crescendo TIAs, or crescendo claudication. Without intervention, 10%\u201320% risk of ipsilateral stroke within two weeks. Natural history: progressive worsening due to recurrent emboli or hypoperfusion.

What is the next best step in management?","options":["Craniotomy with clipping","Endovascular coiling","Observation"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Endovascular coiling","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B, Endovascular coiling. The landmark International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) demonstrated that patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with endovascular coiling have a significantly better functional outcome at one year compared with surgical clipping (modified Rankin Scale 0\u20132: 23.5% higher in the coiling arm; p = 0.002). A meta-analysis by van der Schaaf et al. (2016) confirmed lower procedure\u2010related morbidity (3.1% vs. 12.6%; OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15\u20130.35) with coiling. Posterior communicating artery aneurysms, particularly when narrow\u2010necked and accessible via catheter, are ideal candidates for coiling per current AHA/ASA guidelines (Class I, Level A). Option A, craniotomy with clipping, carries higher surgical morbidity and longer recovery and is generally reserved for broad\u2010necked aneurysms not amenable to endovascular access (AHA/ASA 2012). Option C, observation, is inappropriate in the setting of confirmed ruptured aneurysm due to the high risk of rebleeding (annual rebleeding risk up to 40% in the first month) and mortality (Konstas et al., 2019).","conceptual_foundation":"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to aneurysmal rupture is classified under ICD-11 code 8B00.0. Aneurysms arise from focal defects in the internal elastic lamina of intracranial arteries. The posterior communicating artery (PCOM) originates from the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and runs to join the posterior cerebral artery. PCOM aneurysms represent ~15\u201320% of all intracranial aneurysms and often present with SAH and cranial nerve III palsy owing to mass effect. Embryologically, PCOM segments derive from the dorsal division of the ICA, sharing similar histology with the anterior circulation. Hemodynamically, the junction of the PCOM and ICA creates flow patterns prone to wall shear stress and aneurysm formation. Differential diagnoses for acute SAH include perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal bleeds, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, and trauma.","pathophysiology":"Normal intracranial arterial walls consist of three layers: intima with endothelium, media with smooth muscle, and adventitia. In saccular aneurysm formation, chronic hemodynamic stress leads to degradation of the internal elastic lamina and media through upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20102, MMP\u20109) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1). Rupture occurs when wall tension (per Laplace\u2019s law) exceeds wall strength. In SAH, extravasated blood into the subarachnoid space triggers vasospasm via oxyhemoglobin\u2010induced endothelial dysfunction, nitric oxide scavenging, and smooth muscle contraction, peaking at days 5\u201314 post\u2010bleed. Rebleeding risk is highest in the first 24 hours (up to 4%) and before definitive aneurysm securing. Coiling isolates the aneurysm sac by packing platinum coils, promoting thrombosis and preventing rebleeding without the need for open craniotomy.","clinical_manifestation":"Aneurysmal SAH classically presents with sudden onset \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache reaching maximal intensity within seconds, often described as the worst headache of life (96% sensitivity). Nausea, vomiting, meningismus (neck stiffness in ~70%), photophobia, and reduced consciousness (Hunt-Hess grade) are common. Focal deficits, such as oculomotor nerve palsy (in PCOM aneurysms), occur in ~10\u201320%. Sentinel headaches occur in ~10\u201315%, days to weeks prior. Unsecured aneurysms carry a 30\u201350% risk of rebleeding within two weeks and a 40% overall case fatality rate. Nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage presents similarly but with negative angiography and a benign course.","diagnostic_approach":"In suspected SAH, noncontrast head CT within 6 hours of headache onset has >95% sensitivity. If CT is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, lumbar puncture demonstrating xanthochromia confirms SAH. Once SAH is confirmed, CT angiography (sensitivity 95\u201398%, specificity 98\u2013100%) localizes aneurysms. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard (sensitivity ~99%) and is recommended prior to endovascular treatment for detailed vascular mapping. Preprocedural assessment includes brain MRI/MRA if CT-DSA inconclusive, and dual antiplatelet testing if stent assistance is anticipated. Cardiac monitoring and transcranial Doppler monitor for vasospasm post-procedure.","management_principles":"The immediate priority after SAH is aneurysm securing within 72 hours to prevent rebleeding. For anatomically suitable aneurysms, endovascular coiling is first-line (AHA/ASA Class I, Level A). Coiling technique involves microcatheter navigation into the aneurysm sac and deployment of detachable platinum coils, promoting intrasaccular thrombosis. Adjunctive devices (stents, balloons) are used for wide-neck aneurysms. Surgical clipping is reserved for complex anatomy, large fusiform aneurysms, or failure of endovascular therapy. Nimodipine is administered prophylactically to reduce vasospasm (60\u2009mg orally every 4\u2009h for 21 days; Class I, Level A). Blood pressure is maintained below 160\u2009mm\u2009Hg pre-securing and 120\u2013140\u2009mm\u2009Hg post-securing. External ventricular drain is indicated for hydrocephalus, and prophylactic anticonvulsants are not routinely recommended.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-coiling, noninvasive vascular imaging (MRA or CTA) is recommended at 6 months to assess for coil compaction (Class IIa, Level B). If stable, follow-up intervals extend to 1 year and then at 5-year intervals. Transcranial Doppler monitoring for vasospasm daily through day 14 aids in early detection. Long-term management includes blood pressure control (target <140/90\u2009mm\u2009Hg), smoking cessation, and lipid optimization. Patients should undergo neuropsychological screening at 3\u20136 months for cognitive and mood sequelae. Return to driving and work is individualized based on neurological recovery, generally after 6\u201312 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Thunderclap headache with CT evidence of SAH mandates prompt vascular imaging to localize aneurysm. 2. Endovascular coiling reduces morbidity compared with clipping in posterior circulation aneurysms (ISAT). 3. Nimodipine is the only proven therapy to reduce delayed cerebral ischemia post-SAH. 4. Early aneurysm securing (within 72\u2009h) dramatically lowers rebleeding risk. 5. Post-treatment imaging surveillance is critical for detecting coil compaction and recurrence.","references":"1.

This occurs due to the retinotopic organization of the visual pathways, where lesions in the same area of the retina lead to similar visual field deficits in both eyes.\n- Macular Sparing: The fovea, or macula, which is responsible for central vision, is spared due to its dual blood supply from both the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA). This anatomical feature explains why, despite the loss of peripheral vision, patients often retain some central vision.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n- B) Incongruent homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing: Incongruent defects suggest damage to the optic radiations or optic tract rather than the primary visual cortex. In these cases, the visual field loss would not be identical in both eyes, which is not the case here.\n  \n- C) Non-macular sparing with congruent homonymous hemianopia: While congruent homonymous hemianopia is correct, macular sparing is typically present in cases of occipital lobe infarction. Hence, this option contradicts the expected findings.\n\n- D) Non-macular sparing with incongruent homonymous hemianopia: This option is incorrect because it suggests a different mechanism of visual field loss that is not characteristic of occipital lobe strokes. Non-macular sparing would indicate more extensive damage, possibly involving the optic radiations.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nUnderstanding visual field defects requires a grasp of the visual pathway anatomy and physiology. The visual pathway starts from the retina, travels through the optic nerve, and continues to the optic chiasm where some fibers from each eye cross. \n\n- Homonymous Hemianopia: This condition denotes a loss of the same side of the visual field in both eyes. In a left occipital stroke, the right visual field is affected due to the lesion affecting the right hemisphere\u2019s processing of visual stimuli from the left side of the visual field.\n\n- Macular Sparing: This phenomenon is critical in understanding the differences between types of visual field losses. The fovea is represented at the occipital pole, which is supplied by both PCA and MCA, thus providing redundancy. In contrast, if the optic tract or radiations are affected, macular sparing is typically absent.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nAn acute stroke in the left occipital lobe usually results from ischemia due to an embolic or thrombotic event. \n\n- Ischemic Injury: The focal area of ischemia leads to cell death, specifically in the primary visual cortex, which impairs the processing of visual information coming from the contralateral visual field. The retinotopic organization of the visual cortex means that specific areas correspond to specific visual field segments.\n\n- Dual Blood Supply: The macula's preservation is largely attributed to its dual blood supply. When blood flow is compromised, the peripheral vision is affected more severely than central vision, allowing for macular sparing.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nPatients with a stroke in the left occipital lobe typically present with:\n\n- Visual Field Loss: Right homonymous hemianopia is the classical presentation, where the right half of the visual field is lost in both eyes.\n- Macular Sparing: Patients may still retain some degree of vision in the center of their visual field, allowing them to perceive details directly in front of them, which can be a clinical feature that helps in diagnosis.\n- Other Neurological Symptoms: Depending on the extent of the stroke, patients might also experience difficulty with visual processing, including problems with recognizing objects, visual agnosia, or even hemianopic neglect.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\n### Diagnostic Tests:\n- Clinical Examination: A thorough neurological examination will reveal visual field defects through confrontation testing.\n- Visual Field Testing: Automated perimetry can provide a quantitative assessment of visual field loss and confirm the diagnosis of homonymous hemianopia.\n- Imaging: CT or MRI scans of the brain are critical to visualize the stroke's location and extent. An MRI is particularly useful in identifying acute ischemic strokes.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- The presence of right homonymous hemianopia on perimetry and confirmation of an infarct in the left occipital lobe on imaging supports the diagnosis.\n  \n### Differential Diagnosis:\n- Other conditions that can produce similar visual field deficits include tumors, traumatic injuries, and other vascular events affecting the visual pathway. Distinguishing these from a typical stroke is essential for appropriate management.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\n### Acute Management:\n- Thrombolysis or Thrombectomy: If the patient presents within the therapeutic window (generally within 4.5 hours for thrombolysis), appropriate treatment to restore blood flow may be initiated.\n- Supportive Care: This includes monitoring vital signs, managing blood pressure, and ensuring adequate oxygenation.\n\n### Rehabilitation:\n- Vision Therapy: Depending on the extent of visual impairment, patients may benefit from visual rehabilitation programs, especially aimed at improving adaptive skills.\n- Occupational Therapy: Helps patients adapt their daily living activities and improve quality of life post-stroke.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\n### Monitoring:\n- Regular follow-up appointments should focus on neurological recovery, visual function assessment, and management of risk factors for recurrent stroke, such as hypertension and diabetes.\n\n### Prognosis:\n- The prognosis varies, but many patients may experience some improvement in visual function over time. Rehabilitation outcomes depend on the severity of the initial stroke and the patient's overall health.\n\n### Complications:\n- Potential complications include the development of other strokes, persistent visual deficits, and psychological effects like anxiety or depression stemming from the loss of independence.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Remember the Retinotopic Map: Visual field defects align with the anatomical layout of the visual pathways; congruent defects are indicative of occipital lobe involvement.\n- Macular Sparing is a Key Indicator: If a patient presents with right homonymous hemianopia and retains central vision, it strongly suggests a left occipital lobe lesion rather than optic tract or radiation damage.\n- Timely Intervention is Critical: Early recognition and management of strokes can significantly improve outcomes.\n\n## 9.

Therefore, the classic finding for an occipital lobe stroke is a congruent homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:09:19.943048","word_count":3895,"source_file":"Part I 2018_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","import_source":"vascular_neurology_stroke_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient with stroke is receiving physiotherapy and speech therapy. What is the type of prevention being implemented?","options":["Primary","Secondary","Tertiary"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Tertiary","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C. Tertiary prevention. Rehabilitation measures such as physiotherapy and speech therapy implemented after a stroke aim to reduce disability, restore function, and improve quality of life. These interventions occur once the disease process (stroke) has already manifested and its acute complications have been managed, distinguishing them from primary and secondary prevention strategies. Option A (Primary prevention) is incorrect because primary prevention refers to interventions that prevent the initial occurrence of disease (e.g., blood pressure control, smoking cessation to prevent stroke). Option B (Secondary prevention) is incorrect because secondary prevention encompasses measures that detect and treat asymptomatic disease early or prevent recurrence (e.g., antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure management after minor stroke or transient ischemic attack). In contrast, tertiary prevention focuses on limiting disability and promoting rehabilitation after the disease event has occurred.","conceptual_foundation":"Public health prevention is classified into three levels: primary (prevent disease onset), secondary (early detection and treatment to halt progression or recurrence), and tertiary (reduce impact and rehabilitate after established disease). In stroke care, primary prevention includes lifestyle modifications and risk factor management to prevent the first stroke. Secondary prevention includes acute reperfusion therapies, antithrombotic agents, and management of vascular risk factors to prevent recurrence. Tertiary prevention includes multidisciplinary rehabilitation services\u2014physiotherapy to improve motor deficits and gait; occupational therapy to enhance activities of daily living; and speech and language therapy to address dysphagia, dysarthria, and aphasia. This rehabilitation phase leverages neuroplasticity and is guided by functional assessment scales (e.g., Modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index).","pathophysiology":"Ischemic stroke results from interrupted cerebral blood flow, leading to neuronal energy failure, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and cell death in the ischemic core, with surrounding penumbral tissue at risk. Survivors often have residual neurological deficits\u2014motor weakness due to corticospinal tract injury, speech impairment from damage to perisylvian language areas, and sensory deficits. Rehabilitation (tertiary prevention) drives synaptogenesis, axonal sprouting, and cortical reorganization via repeated task-specific practice, promoting recovery in perilesional and contralateral homologous regions. Physiotherapy targets muscle strength, balance, and coordination, reducing spasticity through neuroplastic adaptations. Speech therapy addresses neurogenic dysphagia and language impairments by engaging intact neural networks and compensatory strategies.","clinical_manifestation":"Post-stroke sequelae vary according to lesion location and extent. Common manifestations include hemiparesis (up to 80% of survivors), dysarthria (50\u201375%), aphasia (25\u201340% in left hemisphere strokes), dysphagia (up to 50%), and cognitive deficits (20\u201350%). Rehabilitation is tailored: physiotherapy focuses on motor control deficits, gait training, and prevention of joint contractures. Speech therapy targets expressive and receptive aphasia, apraxia of speech, and swallowing safety. Early intensive rehabilitation (within first 2 weeks) is associated with better functional outcomes and decreased long-term disability. Delayed or inadequate therapy increases risk of chronic dependence and institutionalization.","diagnostic_approach":"After acute stroke diagnosis by noncontrast CT or MRI, and stabilization with acute and secondary prevention measures, a comprehensive functional assessment guides tertiary interventions. First-tier evaluations include the Modified Rankin Scale for global disability, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for motor impairment, and the Functional Oral Intake Scale for swallowing. Second-tier assessments may utilize quantitative gait analysis, standardized language batteries (e.g., Western Aphasia Battery), and instrumental swallowing studies (videofluoroscopy). These tools quantify deficits, set rehabilitation goals, and monitor progress. Pre-test probability for rehabilitation benefit is high (>70% in first month), and functional gains are most rapid in the initial 3 months post-stroke.","management_principles":"Stroke management is phased: acute reperfusion (thrombolysis/mechanical thrombectomy), secondary prevention (antithrombotics, statins, blood pressure control), and tertiary prevention (rehabilitation). Tertiary care is delivered by an interdisciplinary team. Physiotherapy modalities include task-specific training, constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), and robotic-assisted gait training. Speech therapy employs language stimulation, neuromuscular electrical stimulation for dysphagia, and computerized aphasia rehabilitation. Guidelines (AHA/ASA 2016) give Class I recommendation for multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation starting within 2 weeks. Dose-dependent effects: \u22653 hours/day of combined therapies yields optimal functional recovery. Adverse effects are minimal; precautions include cardiac monitoring during intensive exercise.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up for stroke survivors includes periodic functional assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months post-discharge. The AHA/ASA guidelines recommend using the Modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index to track disability and independence. Swallowing evaluations are repeated if aspiration risk persists. Long-term follow-up addresses secondary prevention adjustments, mental health screening for post-stroke depression, spasticity management, and community reintegration support. Care transitions should include home exercise programs, caregiver education, and linkage to outpatient rehabilitation services or stroke support groups.","clinical_pearls":"1. Tertiary prevention in stroke focuses on rehabilitation\u2014physiotherapy and speech therapy\u2014to restore function and reduce disability. 2. Early initiation (within 2 weeks) of multidisciplinary rehab maximizes neuroplasticity and functional gains. 3. Constraint-induced movement therapy can improve upper\u2010limb recovery by driving cortical reorganization. 4. Speech and language therapy reduces long-term communication deficits and aspiration pneumonia risk. 5. Regular functional assessments using the Modified Rankin Scale guide therapy intensity and duration.","references":"1. Kernan WN, et al.
