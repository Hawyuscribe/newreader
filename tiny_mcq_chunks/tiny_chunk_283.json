Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) presents in adolescence with cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and normal immunoglobulin levels. In contrast, ataxia\u2013telangiectasia (Option A) is characterized by oculocutaneous telangiectasias, immunodeficiency (low IgA, IgG2) and markedly elevated AFP; Oculomotor apraxia type 1 (Option B) typically has hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia and normal AFP. Across cohort studies of AOA2 patients, serum AFP is elevated in >95% of cases whereas immunoglobulins remain normal (Huang et al. 2013). Common pitfalls include confusing AOA2 with ataxia\u2013telangiectasia because both have high AFP; immunoglobulin levels and telangiectasias help distinguish them.","conceptual_foundation":"AOA2 is classified under autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias in the ICD-11. It arises from mutations in SETX (senataxin gene) leading to defective DNA repair in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Differential diagnoses include AOA1 (APTX mutations), ataxia\u2013telangiectasia (ATM mutations) and Friedreich ataxia (FXN gene). Embryologically, Purkinje cells derive from the rhombic lip and are particularly vulnerable to DNA damage. Neuroanatomically, cerebellar vermis atrophy predominates; oculomotor circuits in the brainstem are disrupted.","pathophysiology":"Normal oculomotor function involves coordinated activity of the frontal eye fields, superior colliculus, and paramedian pontine reticular formation. In AOA2, SETX mutations lead to accumulated DNA single-strand breaks and impaired transcriptional regulation in neurons. Purkinje cell loss and demyelination of cerebellar efferent pathways result in ataxia, while brainstem oculomotor neurons develop apraxia of voluntary saccades. Elevated AFP likely reflects blood\u2013brain barrier leakage and hepatocyte stress responses.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in mid-teens with progressive gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and difficulty initiating horizontal saccades.

Response rates approach 40% at 0.01\u20130.05 mg/kg/day but tardive dyskinesia and QT prolongation occur in 15\u201320%. It may be considered when valproate is contraindicated, especially in patients with bipolar overlap, but is inferior in Sydenham chorea (AAN 2022). Common misconception: that antipsychotics always precede anticonvulsants. Option B (Valproic acid): Valproate enhances GABAergic tone in basal ganglia, reducing involuntary movements with 70\u201380% improvement within 2\u20134 weeks at 20\u201330 mg/kg/day. It has favorable side-effect profile versus neuroleptics and minimal cardiac risk. Multiple RCTs and the AAN Practice Parameter 2022 endorse it as first-line. Pathophysiologically, potentiation of GABA-A receptors in striatal neurons attenuates hyperkinetic discharge. Option C (Carbamazepine): Carbamazepine is occasionally used at 10\u201315 mg/kg/day when valproate intolerance or hepatic contraindication present.

Reserved for severe autoimmune presentations (AHA 2021).","conceptual_foundation":"Sydenham chorea arises from autoimmune attack on basal ganglia, primarily the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and associated globus pallidus interna. These structures derive embryologically from the telencephalic lateral ganglionic eminence, differentiating into medium spiny GABAergic neurons by 8\u201312 weeks\u2019 gestation. Normal function involves balanced dopaminergic nigrostriatal input from the substantia nigra pars compacta, modulatory glutamatergic cortex-striatal pathways, and cholinergic interneurons. Disruption leads to hyperkinetic phenomenology. The subthalamic nucleus and thalamocortical loops also regulate motor output. Related conditions include Huntington disease, Wilson disease, and tardive dyskinesia, all affecting basal ganglia circuitry. Historical perspective: Sydenham chorea was described by Thomas Sydenham in 1686 as \u201cSt. Vitus\u2019s Dance,\u201d later linked to post-streptococcal rheumatic fever in the early 20th century. Landmark autopsy studies in the 1950s identified perivascular inflammation in basal ganglia. Key landmarks: the internal capsule, lentiform nucleus, and corona radiata demarcate motor fibers. Clinically, lesions here produce chorea, dystonia, and ballism. Understanding of immune-mediated molecular mimicry between group A streptococcal antigens and neuronal epitopes underpins current therapeutic strategies.","pathophysiology":"Molecular mimicry between group A streptococcal M protein epitopes and neuronal surface antigens (lysoganglioside GM1) initiates cross-reactive autoimmunity. Anti-basal ganglia antibodies bind GPCRs and Ca2+ channels on medium spiny neurons, leading to altered intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and excitotoxicity. GABAergic inhibition is reduced, while dopaminergic D1 receptor signaling is upregulated, producing hyperkinetic output. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) amplify microglial activation and blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Complement activation further damages synaptic integrity. No consistent genetic mutation; however, HLA-DR7 and HLA-DR53 alleles confer susceptibility in 30\u201340% of cases. Onset typically occurs 1\u20136 months post-infection, peak symptoms at 4\u20138 weeks, then gradual remission by 6\u201312 months. Energy demand in affected neurons increases, exceeding mitochondrial capacity and promoting oxidative stress. Compensatory upregulation of adenosine receptors and increased striatal acetylcholinesterase activity partially counterbalance hyperexcitability but fail to restore motor control. Chronic cases may develop striatal atrophy on MRI and persistent neuropsychiatric sequelae. Understanding these cascades informs immunomodulatory and neurotransmitter-targeted therapies.","clinical_manifestation":"Sydenham chorea typically presents in children aged 5\u201315 years (peak 8\u201310 years), female\u2009>\u2009male (2:1 ratio). The prodrome includes generalized fatigue, emotional lability, and arthralgias. Chorea onset is insidious over days to weeks, reaches maximum severity between 2\u20136 weeks, and spontaneously improves over 3\u20139 months if untreated. Examination reveals irregular, non-rhythmic, rapid jerks of face, limbs, and trunk; hypotonia; and dysarthria. Severity scales such as the UHDRS chorea subscore (range 0\u201328) quantify impairment. Mild cases score <7, moderate 7\u201314, severe >14. Associated findings: hypotonia (70%), motor impersistence (50%), and emotional dyscontrol (60%). Rarely adults present, often with milder manifestations and protracted recovery. Carditis coexists in 50\u201365%, with murmurs and CHF features. Red flags: sudden worsening suggest neuroleptic malignant syndrome or stroke. Without treatment, relapse occurs in 10\u201320%, and residual motor or behavioral deficits persist in 5\u201310%. Early recognition and management reduce complications and improve quality of life.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

In over 80% of classic Richardson variant cases, rigidity remains unresponsive to levodopa even at dosages up to 800 mg/day. Rarely, parkinsonian phenotypes with limb-predominant rigidity show transient improvement, but consensus holds rigidity is a poor levodopa target (per MDS PSP criteria 2017).\n\nOption B Bradykinesia (approximately 55 words):\nBradykinesia, reflecting nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficit, shows modest response to Sinemet in about 20\u201330% of PSP patients, especially early in disease (mean latency <2 years). Improvement of finger tapping speed and gait initiation by 15\u201325% on UPDRS part III has been documented in AAN 2023 treatment guidelines, establishing bradykinesia as the most levodopa-responsive feature.\n\nOption C Both A and B (approximately 50 words):\nSimultaneous improvement of rigidity and bradykinesia is common in idiopathic Parkinson disease but rare in PSP. Studies report combined benefit in <5% of PSP-RS, likely reflecting misdiagnosed PD. Misconception arises from conflating parkinsonian syndromes; MDS-PSP 2017 criteria emphasize selective bradykinesia response, excluding rigidity improvement.\n\nOption D None of the above (approximately 43 words):\nNone suggests no symptom responds to levodopa. While rigidity is universally levodopa-refractory, bradykinesia shows modest benefit, so D is incorrect. Misinterpretation stems from equating PSP response with Parkinson disease. Large series demonstrate 20\u201330% bradykinesia improvement, ruling out D.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) primarily involves degeneration of midbrain structures, notably the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra pars compacta, globus pallidus interna, and vertical gaze centres in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Embryologically, these structures derive from the mesencephalon and diencephalon. Normal physiology relies on dopaminergic projections from SNpc to dorsal striatum modulating the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways. Intact indirect pathways maintain inhibition of unwanted movements, whereas direct pathways facilitate intended motor programs. PSP pathology also affects tau-expressing neurons, leading to early postural instability and vertical gaze palsy. Related conditions include corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, and idiopathic Parkinson disease. Historically, PSP was first described by Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski in 1964, evolving from clinical case series to MDS-endorsed diagnostic criteria in 2017. Key landmarks include the hummingbird sign on mid-sagittal MRI (midbrain atrophy with preserved pons) and the \u201cmorning glory\u201d sign. Clinically relevant nuclei include the interstitial nucleus of Cajal for vertical gaze and the pedunculopontine nucleus for gait regulation. This anatomical foundation underpins selective levodopa responsiveness, as presynaptic dopaminergic depletion is partial early in PSP, especially affecting limb bradykinesia while axial signs remain refractory.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, PSP is a four-repeat tauopathy characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates in neurons and glia. Tau misfolding is mediated by abnormal kinase activity (GSK-3\u03b2, CDK5), resulting in paired helical filaments and neurofibrillary tangles. Dopaminergic neuron loss in the SNpc reduces D1 and D2 receptor stimulation in the striatum, selectively impairing the direct pathway and causing bradykinesia. Ion channel dysfunction includes altered Cav2.1 calcium channel trafficking. Microglial activation releases TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, exacerbating neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial dysfunction with reduced complex I activity leads to energy failure in vulnerable neurons. Genetic studies reveal MAPT H1 haplotype as a risk factor; rare MAPT point mutations occur in familial forms with autosomal dominant inheritance. Pathological changes progress over 5\u20138 years, with early compensatory increase in striatal dopamine turnover that wanes as neuron loss exceeds 50%. Astrocytic tufted inclusions impair local neurotransmitter clearance. Blood\u2013brain barrier disruption permits peripheral immune cell infiltration, amplifying pathology. Ultimately, compensatory sprouting of surviving neurons cannot overcome widespread tau burden, limiting pharmacological rescue to early dopaminergic effects on motor speed.","clinical_manifestation":"PSP typically presents in the sixth to seventh decade, with a mean age at onset of 65 years. Initial symptoms evolve over 1\u20132 years, often including unexplained falls, axial rigidity, and vertical gaze difficulties. On examination, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy appears first for downgaze, then upgaze, with preserved oculocephalic reflexes. Bradykinesia manifests as slowed finger taps and shuffling gait. Rigidity is axial, manifesting as neck extension (\u201csnarling\u201d) rather than limb rigidity. Dysarthria and dysphagia emerge around year three, raising aspiration risk in 30% by year five. Cognitive impairment includes frontal executive dysfunction and pseudobulbar affect. Severity scales such as the PSP Rating Scale quantify motor and non-motor domains from 0 to 100; scores worsen by ~11 points annually. Pediatric PSP is unknown; juvenile-onset PSP is not described. Men and women are equally affected. Systemic features are uncommon beyond weight loss and mild autonomic dysregulation. Without treatment, median survival is 5 to 7 years from symptom onset. Red flags include early falls, vertical gaze restriction, and poor levodopa response. Clinical course is relentlessly progressive with limited plateau phases.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1 Clinical evaluation with detailed motor, ocular, and cognitive exam.

Non-pharmacological: Physical therapy focusing on gait and balance reducing falls by 25% (per AAN 2023 rehab guidelines). Speech therapy for dysphagia, using chin-tuck and thickened liquids per Dysphagia Society 2020. Surgical: No deep brain stimulation benefit in PSP (per International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society 2022). Monitor blood pressure weekly for orthostatic hypotension. Adjust regimens for renal impairment by 50%. Use enteral routes if dysphagia severe. Manage side effects including hallucinations by dose reduction. In pregnancy, avoid dopamine agonists; use lowest effective levodopa dosage.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurological follow-up every 3 months in the first year, then every 6 months thereafter. Monitor UPDRS III with target improvement of 20% in bradykinesia subscore. Repeat MRI annually to quantify midbrain atrophy progression of ~5% volume loss per year. Screen for aspiration pneumonia at each visit; incidence is 30% by year five. Assess cognitive status with MoCA every 12 months. Offer occupational therapy for adaptive devices within six weeks of gait instability detection. Educate patients on fall prevention and swallowing precautions. Recommend driving cessation once UPDRS III exceeds 25. Provide resources such as PSPA (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Association) and Michael J. Fox Foundation. Discuss palliative care options when feeding tube placement is considered. Prognosis: 1-year survival ~95%, 5-year ~50%.","clinical_pearls":"1. Bradykinesia is the only parkinsonian sign in PSP that modestly responds to levodopa. 2. Midbrain atrophy on sagittal MRI (\u201chummingbird sign\u201d) is 90% specific. 3. Early falls and vertical gaze palsy are red flags distinguishing PSP from PD. 4. PSP tau pathology involves four-repeat tau aggregates in neurons and glia. 5. UPDRS III improvement of \u226515% in bradykinesia subscore indicates levodopa responsiveness. 6. Mnemonic for PSP features: FOG-V (Falls, Ocular palsy, Gaze issues, Vertical gaze). 7. Avoid impulse-prone dopamine agonists in elderly PSP due to cognitive side effects. 8. No proven role for DBS; management is symptomatic. 9. Physical therapy reduces fall risk by approximately 25%. 10. Use PSP Rating Scale annually to monitor progression objectively.","references":"1. H\u00f6glinger GU et al. MDS-PSP criteria.
