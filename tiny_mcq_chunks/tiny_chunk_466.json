Core features include visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and autonomic dysfunction such as urinary incontinence. Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia (option B) requires a year of established motor symptoms before dementia onset. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (option C) has prominent memory loss without early hallucinations or parkinsonism. Frontotemporal dementia (option D) presents with behavioral changes and language impairment, not early parkinsonism or visual hallucinations. Consensus criteria (McKeith IG, 2017) support DLB diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"DLB is classified under ICD-11 as Lewy body disease. It is a synucleinopathy related to Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple system atrophy. Differential includes Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, and PSP. Historically, DLB was distinguished after autopsy studies revealed cortical Lewy bodies. DSM-5-TR includes DLB under major neurocognitive disorders.","pathophysiology":"DLB is characterized by \u03b1-synuclein aggregates (Lewy bodies) in cortical and subcortical neurons. This disrupts cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, producing cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Autonomic dysfunction arises from Lewy pathology in brainstem and peripheral autonomic ganglia. Neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction also contribute.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present with fluctuating cognition (range 45\u201365%), recurrent visual hallucinations (visual formed images in 60\u201380%), parkinsonism (bradykinesia, rigidity in 70%), and autonomic features (urinary incontinence in 30\u201350%). REM sleep behavior disorder is a supportive feature. Onset is insidious in the 60s\u201370s age group.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: clinical criteria per 2017 DLB consortium. MRI to exclude alternative causes. Dopaminergic imaging (DAT scan) shows reduced uptake in striatum (sensitivity 78\u201388%, specificity 90%). Cardiac MIBG scintigraphy demonstrates reduced myocardial uptake. EEG may show posterior slow-wave activity. CSF may show decreased A\u03b242 and elevated tau.","management_principles":"Symptomatic treatment includes cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, class II evidence) for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Parkinsonism treated with low-dose levodopa (start 50 mg TID) due to risk of worsening hallucinations. Autonomic symptoms managed with nonpharmacological measures and midodrine for orthostasis. Antipsychotics are avoided; quetiapine or clozapine used cautiously for severe psychosis.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor cognition and motor symptoms every 3\u20136 months. Repeat imaging only if atypical progression. Screen annually for autonomic complications (orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention). Adjust medications gradually to avoid precipitating delirium.","clinical_pearls":"1. Visual hallucinations in DLB are vivid, well formed, and recurrent. 2. Onset of dementia within one year of parkinsonism distinguishes DLB from PDD. 3. DAT scan aids differentiation from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. 4. Cholinesterase inhibitors improve hallucinations and cognition in DLB. 5. Neuroleptic sensitivity is a red flag in DLB\u2014avoid typical antipsychotics.","references":"1.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Pick's disease","Alzheimer's disease","Frontotemporal dementia","Vascular dementia"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Frontotemporal dementia","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Pick\u2019s disease) often overlaps clinically with frontotemporal dementia but classically presents with asymmetric frontotemporal atrophy, tau\u2010positive Pick bodies on histopathology, and exaggerated disinhibition with preserved language in early stages. It accounts for only 5\u201315% of FTD spectrum cases; pure Pick pathology is rare compared to TDP\u201043 or tauopathies in FTD cohorts (Ratnavalli et al. 2002). Option B (Alzheimer\u2019s disease) is the most common dementia (60\u201370% prevalence), but typically begins with episodic memory impairment, hippocampal atrophy on MRI, and amyloid\u2010\u03b2 plaques, progressing to language deficits only in later Braak stages (Braak and Braak 1991). Option D (Vascular dementia) shows stepwise cognitive decline, focal neurologic signs, lacunar infarcts or white matter hyperintensities on MRI, and accounts for 10\u201320% of dementias; language is relatively preserved until extensive multi\u2010infarct involvement (Roman et al. 1993). Option C (Frontotemporal dementia) definitively fits the profile: selective degeneration of frontal and anterior temporal lobes produces early word\u2010finding difficulty, semantic deficits, and behavioral changes. The semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia comprises about 20\u201330% of FTD, with left anterior temporal atrophy on MRI and TDP\u201043 type C inclusions in 60% of cases (FTDC 2011). Common misconceptions include overattributing behavioral changes to Alzheimer\u2019s and underrecognizing early language\u2010predominant FTD despite consensus criteria and neuroimaging data supporting C as correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) primarily involves degeneration of the frontal lobes, anterior temporal lobes, and associated white matter tracts, including uncinate fasciculus and cingulum bundle. Anatomical landmarks include Broca\u2019s area (Brodmann areas 44/45), anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior temporal pole. Embryologically, these regions derive from the telencephalon; disruptions in early radial glial scaffolding may predispose to selective vulnerability. In normal physiology, frontal lobes mediate executive function, judgment, social cognition and language initiation via corticocortical and corticosubcortical loops involving the caudate and thalamic nuclei. The temporal pole integrates semantic memory via hippocampal connections through the perforant pathway. Related syndromes include semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, behavioral variant FTD, and progressive supranuclear palsy due to overlapping tau or TDP\u201043 pathology. Historically, Arnold Pick first described focal lobar atrophy in 1892; the criteria evolved through Mesulam\u2019s PPA descriptions (1982) and the International FTD Consortium\u2019s 2011 consensus defining semantic variant. Key gyral landmarks such as superior temporal gyrus correlate with naming, while inferior frontal gyrus loss maps to expressive deficits. Recognition of these regions underpins targeted imaging protocols and cognitive assessments.","pathophysiology":"Frontotemporal dementia encompasses heterogeneous molecular mechanisms. The most common pathologies are TDP\u201043 proteinopathy (in ~50% of cases), tauopathies (~45%), and fused in sarcoma (FUS) aggregates (~5%). Mutations in MAPT (microtubule\u2010associated protein tau) on chromosome 17 lead to abnormal tau phosphorylation, microtubule destabilization, and neuronal cytoskeleton collapse. GRN (progranulin) mutations result in haploinsufficiency, enhanced microglial activation, and elevated inflammatory cytokines like IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1. C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansions trigger RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins that disrupt nuclear transport. On the cellular level, impaired autophagy and ubiquitin\u2010proteasome pathways promote accumulation of misfolded proteins and synaptic loss. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress further compromise energy homeostasis in neurons with high ATP demands. Early compensatory synaptic sprouting fails as proteostasis collapses over 2\u20135 years, resulting in progressive regional atrophy. Neuroinflammatory responses involving astrocytes and microglia exacerbate neuronal injury. These mechanisms converge on disruption of frontotemporal connectivity and executive\u2010language networks, correlating with clinical presentation and imaging patterns.","clinical_manifestation":"FTD typically presents between ages 45 and 65, although onset can range from 25 to 80 years. Early symptoms include subtle word\u2010finding pauses, reduced semantic comprehension, and inappropriate social behavior. Over 6\u201312 months, expressive language deteriorates, characterized by anomia, impaired naming, and surface dyslexia. Neurological exam may reveal preserved motor strength but impaired frontal release signs (grasp, palmomental reflexes) and reduced saccade velocity in associated tauopathies. Older patients may show more rapid progression, with cognitive decline plateauing at 4\u20138 years post\u2010onset. Men and women are equally affected, though certain genetic variants have slight male predominance. Systemic manifestations such as weight loss and autonomic dysfunction occur in advanced disease. Severity can be graded by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale modified for FTD, with scores progressing from 0.5 to 3. Red flags include early disinhibition, loss of empathy, perseverative speech, and aspiration from swallowing difficulty. Without intervention, patients lose independence, develop global aphasia, and may require full assistance within 2\u20134 years.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Obtain high\u2010resolution MRI with volumetric T1 and FLAIR sequences to detect frontotemporal atrophy (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. 2. Perform FDG\u2010PET imaging to identify bilateral anterior temporal and frontal hypometabolism per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2021 consensus. 3. Administer comprehensive neuropsychological testing including semantic memory and executive function scales (e.g., Boston Naming Test, Trail Making Test) per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. 4. Collect CSF for A\u03b242, total tau, phospho\u2010tau, and neurofilament light chain to exclude Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (normal A\u03b242 >500 pg/mL, tau <350 pg/mL) per International Biomarker Criteria 2022. 5. Perform genetic screening for MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72 mutations if family history suggests autosomal dominant inheritance per International FTD Consortium 2020 criteria. 6. Conduct EEG to rule out nonconvulsive seizure activity (usually normal background rhythm in FTD) per ILAE 2021 guidelines. 7. Use CT angiography when vascular dementia is suspected (look for multi\u2010territorial infarcts) per American Stroke Association 2021 guidelines.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First\u2010line): Initiate SSRI therapy for behavioral control, e.g., sertraline 50 mg once daily, titrate to 100 mg/day PO (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Consider memantine 5 mg BID, increasing to 10 mg BID for cognitive symptoms (per European Alzheimer\u2019s Society 2020 guidelines). Tier 2 (Second\u2010line): Use trazodone 50 mg nightly for sleep and agitation; may increase to 150 mg (per International FTD Treatment Consensus 2021). Off\u2010label cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil 5 mg PO nightly, increase to 10 mg (per AAN 2022 Practice Parameter). Tier 3 (Third\u2010line): Consider atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine 25 mg at bedtime, titrate to 200 mg/day for refractory aggression (per APA 2019 Consensus). Non\u2010pharmacological interventions include structured behavioral therapy and environmental modifications (per Alzheimer\u2019s Association 2021). In rare severe cases, stereotactic neurosurgical interventions targeting subthalamic nucleus are investigational (success rates ~30% improvement; per European Neurology Society 2023). Monitor liver enzymes and ECG with antipsychotics. Adjust dosing in hepatic impairment. Pregnancy requires risk\u2013benefit analysis. Renal dosing not typically required for SSRIs.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow\u2010up visits every 3\u20136 months to monitor cognitive and behavioral changes. At each visit, reassess CDR\u2010FTD score aiming to limit progression by <0.5 points/year. Repeat MRI annually to track atrophy progression; target <5% volume loss per year. Evaluate liver function tests and ECG quarterly if on antipsychotics. Screen for malnutrition and weight loss; incidence of cachexia is ~30% by year three. Provide physical and speech therapy referrals within first 6 months for dysphagia management. Discuss prognosis: median survival is 6\u20138 years; 1\u2010year mortality ~5%, 5\u2010year ~50%. Educate patients and caregivers on safety, driving cessation when executive dysfunction emerges. Recommend support groups such as the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration and local respite care. Offer legal and financial planning resources early in disease course to optimize quality of life.","clinical_pearls":"1. Frontotemporal dementia often presents before age 65; think \u2018young\u2019 dementia. 2. Word\u2010finding difficulty plus disinhibition strongly suggests semantic variant FTD. 3. MRI shows anterior temporal pole atrophy\u2014gold\u2010standard imaging sign. 4. TDP\u201043 pathology is most common; do not assume tau in every FTD case. 5. SSRIs are first\u2010line for behavioral symptoms; antipsychotics reserved for refractory aggression. 6. Distinguish FTD from primary psychiatric disorders; 25% misdiagnosed with depression or bipolar. 7. Recent consensus (2019\u20132023) emphasizes biomarker testing (CSF NfL) for early detection. 8. Mnemonic \u201cFRONT\u201d helps recall key features: Frontal release, Routine behavior change, Overeating, Naming deficits, Temporal atrophy. 9. Avoid cholinesterase inhibitors unless coexisting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology; they offer minimal benefit and risk worsening behavior.","references":"1.

Lewy body dementia (option C) can have variable CSF tau but amyloid patterns overlap with AD; however, core clinical features include visual hallucinations and parkinsonism. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (option D) is diagnosed by clinical triad and imaging without specific CSF biomarker profile.","conceptual_foundation":"Alzheimer\u2019s disease falls under ICD-11 6C10 and the DSM-5-TR neurocognitive disorder due to AD. Pathologically, AD is defined by extracellular amyloid\u2010\u03b2 plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau tangles. The AT(N) framework classifies AD biomarkers into A (amyloid), T (tau), and N (neurodegeneration). CSF analysis: low A\u03b242 (A+), high p-tau (T+), and high total tau (N+). Differential includes FTD, vascular cognitive impairment, and other neurodegenerative diseases.","pathophysiology":"AD begins with amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases, producing A\u03b242 peptides that aggregate into oligomers and plaques. Tau hyperphosphorylation by kinases (GSK-3\u03b2, CDK5) leads to paired helical filament formation and neurofibrillary tangles. These processes trigger synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Genetic factors include APOE \u03b54 allele, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations. Progressive neuronal loss in hippocampus and association cortices leads to memory impairment and cognitive decline.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical AD presents with insidious episodic memory impairment, followed by language, visuospatial, and executive dysfunction. Initial symptoms include difficulty recalling recent events and new information. Over time, patients develop aphasia, apraxia, and agnosia. Behavioral changes such as depression and apathy may occur. The disease course averages 8\u201310 years. Early-onset familial AD presents before age 65, often with genetic mutations.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes history, cognitive testing (MMSE, MoCA), and MRI to exclude other causes.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)","Alzheimer's disease","Vascular dementia","Lewy body dementia ## Page 11"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Frontotemporal dementia, FTD): This is correct because the patient\u2019s frontal and temporal lobe atrophy on MRI correlates with early behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, and executive dysfunction seen in behavioral variant FTD. Clinical series report that up to 60% of bvFTD patients present initially with behavioral changes before memory impairment (Rascovsky et al. 2011). Pathologically, FTD is characterized by tau or TDP-43 protein inclusions in frontotemporal cortex and basal ganglia (McKhann et al. 2011). A major misconception is equating any dementia with Alzheimer\u2019s pathology; however, in FTD CSF tau/amyloid profiles are normal in 70% of cases. Specific diagnostic criteria (Neary et al. 1998; Rascovsky et al. 2011) underscore frontotemporal atrophy patterns rather than hippocampal involvement.\nOption B (Alzheimer\u2019s disease): Alzheimer\u2019s classically shows hippocampal and parietal atrophy, early memory impairment, visuospatial deficits, and amyloid plaque deposition. Behavioral changes may occur late. MRI sensitivity for AD hippocampal volume loss is 85%, specificity 90% (per AAN 2022). This pattern differs from the frontal-predominant atrophy here.\nOption C (Vascular dementia): Presents with stepwise cognitive decline, focal deficits, white matter hyperintensities on MRI, lacunar infarcts. Frontal atrophy alone without clear vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes in >80% of cases) is less consistent (per AHA/ASA 2014).\nOption D (Lewy body dementia): Characterized by visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder, and fluctuating cognition. Imaging often shows occipital hypometabolism on PET; core features absent in this case (McKeith et al. 2017).\nPathophysiological basis: FTD\u2019s definitive diagnosis is based on selective degeneration of von Economo neurons in frontoinsular cortex and abnormal protein aggregates of tau (MAPT gene mutations) or TDP-43 (GRN, C9orf72 mutations). Common misconceptions include overreliance on memory tests or Alzheimer\u2019s biomarkers, leading to misclassification in 30\u201340% of early bvFTD (Irwin et al. 2015).","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical structures: Frontotemporal dementia involves degeneration of the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9, 10, 11, 12, 46), anterior insula, anterior temporal poles, and striatum. The dorsolateral prefrontal circuit mediates executive function; the orbitofrontal circuit modulates behavior and social cognition; the salience network (anterior cingulate and frontoinsular regions) detects socioemotional cues. Embryology: Frontal and temporal lobes arise from the telencephalon of the prosencephalic vesicle; disruptions in corticogenesis or synaptogenesis may predispose to selective vulnerability.\nNormal physiology: Dorsolateral prefrontal pathways regulate working memory via dopaminergic input from ventral tegmental area; orbitofrontal circuits interact with amygdala for emotional regulation; frontal\u2010striatal loops support planning and goal-directed actions. Related conditions: Primary progressive aphasia variants involve dominant temporal atrophy; corticobasal syndrome features asymmetric motor deficits and apraxia; progressive supranuclear palsy presents with midbrain atrophy and vertical gaze palsy.\nHistorical perspective: Early 20th-century descriptions by Pick highlighted circumscribed frontal lobe atrophy (\u201cPick bodies\u201d). Hugo Spatz later identified spindle neurons; modern consensus criteria (Neary et al. 1998; Rascovsky et al. 2011) refined subtypes. Key landmarks: Superior frontal gyrus involvement correlates with disinhibition; medial temporal pole atrophy aligns with semantic deficits. Clinically, focal neuroimaging guides localization and subtype classification, crucial for prognosis and emerging targeted therapies.","pathophysiology":"Molecular mechanisms: FTD is driven by abnormal aggregation of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), or fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein. Tauopathies involve hyperphosphorylation at serine/threonine residues (e.g., p-tau181), microtubule destabilization, and neuronal inclusions. TDP-43 pathology disrupts RNA splicing and stress granule dynamics. Cellular processes: Impaired autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways lead to accumulation of misfolded proteins. Mitochondrial dysfunction with reduced complex I activity and increased reactive oxygen species is documented in FTD neurons, contributing to energy failure (Wong et al. 2019).\nGenetics: Approximately 30\u201340% of FTD is familial. MAPT mutations (5\u201310% of cases) follow autosomal dominant inheritance; GRN gene haploinsufficiency (progranulin) accounts for 10\u201320%, with 50% penetrance by age 70; hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 underlie up to 40% of familial FTD and 6% sporadic cases. Inflammatory mediators: Elevated CSF interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 correlate with accelerated progression. Metabolic alterations: Glucose hypometabolism in frontoinsular regions appears early, with compensatory hypermetabolism in parietal lobes becoming insufficient over 2\u20135 years. Time course: Neuronal loss and gliosis progress at 5\u20138% annual brain volume reduction. Initial compensatory synaptic sprouting fails by mid-disease, resulting in rapid cognitive and behavioral decline.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom timeline: Prodromal phase begins 2\u20135 years before diagnosis with subtle apathy, irritability, or reduced verbal output. Early phase (0\u20132 years) shows overt behavioral disinhibition, compulsive rituals, hyperorality, and emotional blunting. Peak phase (2\u20135 years) entails progressive executive dysfunction, semantic deficits, and possible motor neuron signs. Neurological exam: Patients often exhibit frontal release signs (grasp, palmomental reflexes), reduced verbal fluency (<8 words per minute), preserved visuospatial function, and primitive reflexes. Apathy scales score >12/16 by year two.\nAge variations: Onset typically between 45\u201365 years; juvenile cases (<45 years) often have C9orf72 expansions, leading to earlier psychosis-like features. Elderly patients present more slowly, with mixed Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. Gender differences: Males predominate behavioral variant (ratio 1.5:1), with more severe disinhibition; females more often have semantic variant primary progressive aphasia.\nSystemic manifestations: Weight gain from hyperorality, metabolic syndrome in 30%, sleep disturbances in 50%. Severity scales: Clinical Dementia Rating plus National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (CDR-FTLD) scoring quantifies stage from 0.5 to 3.0. Red flags: Rapid progression (<1 year), cerebrovascular events, or family history of ALS suggest alternative or mixed pathology. Natural history: Without treatment, median survival is 6\u20138 years from onset, with progressive loss of independence and 80% eventual need for full-time care.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Clinical assessment: Detailed history and behavioral inventories (e.g., the Frontal Behavioral Inventory) per Neary criteria 1998.2. Cognitive testing: Administer Addenbrooke\u2019s Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) sensitivity 90%, specificity 85% for FTD vs Alzheimer\u2019s per AAN 2023 guidelines.3. Structural imaging: MRI brain with 3D T1 volumetric and FLAIR sequences to quantify frontal and temporal atrophy (sensitivity 80%, specificity 75%) per AAN 2023 guidelines.4. Functional imaging: FDG-PET showing frontoinsular hypometabolism if MRI equivocal (sensitivity 88%, specificity 82%) per EFNS consensus 2022.5. CSF biomarkers: Measure amyloid-beta42, total tau, phospho-tau; normal profile (amyloid-beta42 >600 pg/mL, tau <350 pg/mL) supports FTD (sensitivity 70%, specificity 68%) per Biomarker Standards 2021.6. Genetic testing: Screen for MAPT, GRN, C9orf72 mutations in familial cases per ACMG 2020 guidelines.7. Electrophysiology: EEG typically normal; used to exclude prion disease or epileptic encephalopathies per AAN 2022 guidelines.8. Differential diagnosis: Distinguish from psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer\u2019s (hippocampal atrophy, CSF tau profile), vascular dementia (lacunes, WMH), Lewy body dementia (occipital hypometabolism, visual hallucinations) per International Dementia Differential Criteria 2019.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): SSRIs for behavioral control\u2014Sertraline 50\u2013150 mg/day PO (start 25 mg, titrate weekly) per AAN Practice Parameter 2022; citalopram 10\u201340 mg/day PO (max 20 mg if >65 years) per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Tier 1 non-pharmacological: Structured behavioral therapy, environmental modification per AAN 2021 guidelines. Tier 2 (Second-line): Memantine 5 mg/day PO, increase by 5 mg weekly to 20 mg/day (10 mg BID) for executive symptoms per EFNS consensus 2022; trazodone 50\u2013150 mg HS for sleep and agitation per AAN 2022 guidelines. Tier 3 (Third-line): Off-label antipsychotics\u2014Quetiapine 25\u2013200 mg/day PO for severe agitation (monitor QTc) per APA consensus 2021; novel tau-targeted immunotherapies in clinical trials (e.g., anti\u2010tau monoclonal antibodies) per International FTD Consortium 2023. Surgical options: None approved; deep brain stimulation remains investigational per AAN 2022. Special populations: In renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) reduce memantine to 5 mg/day per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Monitor liver function tests and ECG for QT prolongation when on SSRIs or antipsychotics per AHA/ASA 2019.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up intervals: Reassess clinically every 3 months initially, then every 6 months once stable per AAN 2022 guidelines. Behavioral monitoring: Use the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale with target reduction >30% on follow-up.
