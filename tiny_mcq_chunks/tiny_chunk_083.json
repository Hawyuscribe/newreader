[{"question_number":"1","question":"Homonymous hemianopia is most commonly associated with which artery?","options":["Anterior cerebral artery (ACA)","Middle cerebral artery (MCA)","Anterior choroidal artery"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Anterior choroidal artery","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: the anterior choroidal artery (AChA). While posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarcts classically produce homonymous hemianopia via occipital lobe involvement, PCA is not an option here. Of the listed vessels, the AChA supplies the optic tract, lateral geniculate nucleus, and portions of the optic radiations. Infarction of the AChA therefore frequently results in contralateral homonymous hemianopia. Option A (ACA) and B (MCA) infarcts rarely cause complete homonymous hemianopia; ACA strokes mainly affect medial frontal lobes, and MCA strokes more commonly produce inferior quadrantanopia due to parietal lobe involvement.","conceptual_foundation":"Visual field deficits localized to specific vascular territories reflect the arterial supply of the visual pathways. The AChA arises from the internal carotid artery and courses beneath the optic tract to supply the posterior limb of the internal capsule, parts of the optic tract and radiations, and the lateral geniculate nucleus.","pathophysiology":"An AChA infarct typically arises from ATH\u2010mediated stenosis or small\u2010vessel lipohyalinosis, leading to ischemia in structures conveying visual afferents. Loss of input at the optic tract or LGN causes the corresponding homonymous visual field defect.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely with contralateral homonymous hemianopia, often accompanied by contralateral hemiparesis (capsular involvement) and hemisensory loss. Visual symptoms may predominate if corticospinal fibers are spared.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast CT may be normal early. MRI with DWI identifies AChA infarcts in the temporal horn region. Vascular imaging (CTA/MRA) can detect AChA occlusion. Automated perimetry quantifies the field defect.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AIS guidelines with IV tPA if within window, and endovascular therapy is not typically indicated for small AChA strokes. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy and vascular risk factor control.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up MRI assesses infarct stability. Visual rehabilitation with compensatory scanning techniques can improve functional outcomes. Stroke risk factor modification is essential to prevent recurrence.","clinical_pearls":"1. AChA strokes classically present with the triad: hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and homonymous hemianopia. 2. Complete homonymous hemianopia without cortical signs should prompt evaluation for AChA infarct. 3. The AChA is a small vessel\u2014small\u2010vessel disease is a common etiology. 4. Visual field testing is critical in stroke workup. 5. Differentiation from PCA infarct relies on presence of motor/sensory signs.","references":["1. Bogousslavsky J, Regli F.

Graus et al. (2004) reported paraneoplastic etiology in ~60% of adult OMS cases. Infectious causes (option A) are predominantly pediatric postinfectious OMS. Primary autoimmune (option B) without malignancy is less frequent. Drug-induced OMS (option D) is exceedingly rare, with isolated case reports linked to neuroleptics or anticonvulsants.","conceptual_foundation":"Adult OMS falls under para-immune neurological syndromes in ICD-11. Differential diagnoses include Wernicke encephalopathy, Miller Fisher syndrome, and toxic/metabolic encephalopathies. Paraneoplastic OMS arises when tumor antigens elicit cross-reactive immune responses against neuronal antigens.","pathophysiology":"Paraneoplastic OMS involves onconeural antibodies (anti-Ri, anti-Hu) targeting neuronal nuclear antigens, inducing cytotoxic T-cell and antibody-mediated injury in the brainstem and cerebellum. The resultant disinhibition produces opsoclonus and myoclonus.","clinical_manifestation":"Adult patients present subacutely with chaotic eye movements, multifocal myoclonus, ataxia and often neuropsychiatric symptoms. Up to 30% develop concurrent encephalopathy and sleep disturbances.","diagnostic_approach":"Serum/CSF paraneoplastic panel including anti-Ri (sensitivity ~65%, specificity ~92%). Brain MRI is frequently normal. Whole-body PET/CT detects underlying malignancy in ~50% of seronegative patients (Level 2C).","management_principles":"Treat underlying cancer promptly. Immunotherapies include high-dose steroids, IVIG, plasmapheresis, and second-line rituximab (evidence Level B). Symptomatic therapies (clonazepam, valproate) can alleviate myoclonus.","follow_up_guidelines":"Tumor surveillance every 3\u20136 months for 2 years. Neurologic assessment and antibody titers at each visit. Rehabilitation referrals to address ataxia and coordination deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1. Adult OMS is paraneoplastic until proven otherwise. 2. Anti-Ri is the most common antibody in breast and SCLC-associated OMS. 3. PET/CT can reveal occult tumors in seronegative cases. 4. Early tumor therapy correlates with better neurologic outcome. 5. Drug-induced OMS is a diagnosis of exclusion.","references":"1. Graus F et al.
