[{"question_number":"2","question":"Typical multiple sclerosis (MS) presentation includes one or more episodes of:","options":["Unilateral optic neuritis","Painless binocular diplopia","Focal brainstem or cerebellar syndrome","Partial transverse myelitis with sensory and/or motor symptoms"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Unilateral optic neuritis","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct because unilateral optic neuritis is the most frequent initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis, occurring in approximately 20\u201330% of patients at presentation and up to 50% over the course of the disease (Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial, 1992). It classically presents with subacute, painful visual loss, decreased color vision, and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Option B (painless binocular diplopia) can occur in MS due to internuclear ophthalmoplegia, but it is part of broader brainstem syndromes and is less pathognomonic than optic neuritis. Option C (focal brainstem or cerebellar syndrome) and Option D (partial transverse myelitis) are also recognized presentations of MS but are statistically less common as isolated inaugural events compared to optic neuritis. No single option beyond A surpasses optic neuritis in frequency or diagnostic specificity as an initial MS episode.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, classified in ICD-11 under 8A40. It is characterized by multifocal lesions in the brain and spinal cord, with dissemination in time and space. Differential diagnoses include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (ICD-11 8A41), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, sarcoidosis, and metabolic or vascular leukoencephalopathies. Historically, MS was first described by Charcot in the 19th century; over time, the taxonomy has evolved from a clinical\u2013pathological definition to modern criteria incorporating MRI and cerebrospinal fluid findings (McDonald criteria, 2017). MS lesions preferentially involve periventricular white matter, optic nerves, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Embryologically, oligodendrocyte precursor cells derived from the ventral ventricular zone migrate to form the myelin sheath in the CNS; in MS, this myelination process is pathologically disrupted. The key neurotransmitter systems implicated include glutamatergic excitotoxicity and impaired GABAergic inhibition, while genetic studies have identified HLA-DRB1*15:01 as a major risk allele.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of myelinated axons relies on saltatory conduction facilitated by oligodendrocytes. In MS, an aberrant T-cell and B-cell mediated immune response targets myelin antigens, triggered by environmental factors such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection and vitamin D deficiency. Breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier allows entry of autoreactive lymphocytes into the CNS, where they secrete proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) and activate macrophages. Microglial activation and complement deposition lead to myelin phagocytosis, axonal transection, and gliotic scarring. Acute lesions show perivenular inflammatory cuffs; chronic lesions exhibit demyelinated plaques with relative axonal loss. Over time, remyelination attempts by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells may form shadow plaques. Clinically, inflammation produces relapses, while axonal degeneration underlies progressive disability.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinically, MS presents in adults aged 20\u201340 with relapsing\u2013remitting episodes. Optic neuritis manifests as unilateral visual blurring/pain on eye movement in ~20\u201330% of initial presentations. Brainstem/cerebellar syndromes (internuclear ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, dysarthria) occur in ~15\u201320%. Partial transverse myelitis with sensory level, motor weakness, and sphincter dysfunction is seen in ~10\u201315%. Symptoms evolve over days to weeks and may partially or fully resolve, with symptom-free intervals. Subtypes include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing\u2013remitting MS, secondary progressive MS, and primary progressive MS, each with distinct trajectories and demographic patterns (female predominance in relapsing\u2013remitting, more equal sex ratio in progressive forms).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis per 2017 McDonald criteria requires demonstration of dissemination in space (\u22651 T2 lesion in \u22652 characteristic regions: periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal) and dissemination in time (new T2 or gadolinium-enhancing lesion on follow-up MRI or simultaneous presence of enhancing and non-enhancing lesions). MRI sensitivity is ~95% and specificity ~50% for MS; cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands have sensitivity ~85% and specificity ~95%. Visual evoked potentials can show delayed P100 latency, supporting subclinical involvement. Screening labs include B12, ANA, anti-aquaporin-4 and anti-MOG antibodies to exclude mimics. Evoked potentials and optical coherence tomography may be second-tier tests in ambiguous cases.","management_principles":"Acute relapses are treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1\u2009g/day for 3\u20135 days; Class I, Level A). Plasma exchange is indicated for steroid-refractory severe relapses (Class II, Level B). Disease-modifying therapies include interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate (reduce annualized relapse rate ~30%; Class I), natalizumab (68% relapse reduction; Class I), fingolimod (54% reduction; Class I), ocrelizumab (46% reduction in progression; Class I) and others. Treatment choice balances efficacy, safety, JC virus status, and patient preference. Symptomatic management addresses spasticity (baclofen, tizanidine), neuropathic pain (gabapentinoids), fatigue (amantadine), and bladder dysfunction (anticholinergics). Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is integral.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up involves neurologic assessments every 6\u201312 months, annual MRI to monitor new or enlarging lesions, and periodic laboratory monitoring for therapy adverse effects (CBC, LFTs, JC virus serology for natalizumab). Patient\u2010reported outcome measures (MSIS-29) and functional tests (EDSS score) guide management. Long-term prognostic factors include early relapse frequency, lesion burden on baseline MRI, incomplete recovery from initial attacks, and spinal cord involvement.","clinical_pearls":"1. Unilateral painful optic neuritis with afferent pupillary defect is highly suggestive of MS. 2. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia causing diplopia is a key brainstem sign. 3. McDonald 2017 criteria allow early diagnosis using MRI alone. 4. High-dose steroids speed recovery but do not alter long-term course. 5. Early initiation of high-efficacy DMTs improves long-term disability outcomes.","references":"1. Thompson AJ, Banwell BL, Barkhof F, et al.

What antibody is likely to be found?","options":["Anti-GAD and amphiphysin"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Anti-GAD and amphiphysin","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Anti-GAD and amphiphysin. Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is classically associated with high-titer antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), the enzyme responsible for GABA synthesis. Anti-GAD65 antibodies are present in approximately 60\u201380% of idiopathic SPS cases (Dalakas et al. Ann Neurol 2003;53(6):673\u2013678). Amphiphysin antibodies occur in a paraneoplastic variant of SPS, particularly associated with breast cancer or small-cell lung cancer; they are detected in ~5\u201310% of SPS patients and correlate with an underlying neoplasm (McKeon et al. Lancet Neurol 2018;17(7):615\u2013627). No other autoantibodies have this dual pattern. \n\nAll other potential antibodies (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor, anti-aquaporin-4) are not linked to the characteristic axial stiffness and spasms of SPS. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies cause encephalitis with psychiatric features and dyskinesias, not hyperlordosis. Anti-aquaporin-4 is pathognomonic for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, which present with optic neuritis and myelitis. Thus, only anti-GAD65 and anti-amphiphysin fit the clinical and paraneoplastic profile of SPS.","conceptual_foundation":"Stiff-person syndrome is an autoimmune disorder targeting inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. In the 2018 International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), SPS is classified under G25.8 (\u201cOther specified extrapyramidal and movement disorders\u201d) with an autoimmune etiology. Differential diagnoses include tetanus, segmental myoclonus, and dystonias, but the hallmark continuous involuntary muscle activity and exaggerated lumbar lordosis are unique to SPS. Embryologically, GAD65 is expressed in GABAergic interneurons derived from ventricular zone precursors; disruption leads to disinhibition of motor neurons. The lumbar paraspinal muscles receive input from the anterior horn cells at L1\u2013L3; loss of GABAergic tone here produces the characteristic hyperlordosis. On a molecular level, GAD65 catalyzes the decarboxylation of glutamate to GABA; amphiphysin is involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Autoantibody binding impairs these proteins, reducing GABA release and causing uncontrolled muscle activation.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology depends on GABA, the chief CNS inhibitory neurotransmitter, synthesized by GAD65 in presynaptic terminals. GABA binds GABAA receptors on alpha motor neurons, opening chloride channels and producing hyperpolarization. In SPS, anti-GAD65 antibodies reduce enzyme activity by ~50\u201370% (Dalakas et al. Ann Neurol 2003), decreasing GABA levels. Amphiphysin autoantibodies disrupt endocytosis of synaptic vesicles, further impairing inhibitory signaling. The net effect is persistent firing of spinal motor neurons, leading to continuous muscle rigidity, spasms, and characteristic hyperlordosis. Compensatory changes include upregulation of GABAB receptors, but these are insufficient to restore normal inhibitory tone. Compared to tetanus toxin, which cleaves synaptobrevin to block inhibitory glycinergic transmission, SPS is an antibody-mediated dysfunction of GABAergic pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"SPS typically presents in women aged 30\u201360 with progressive stiffness of axial and proximal limb muscles. ~90% report lumbar stiffness leading to hyperlordosis; 70% have painful spasms triggered by noise or emotional stress. Hip girdle involvement causes gait difficulty. Paraneoplastic SPS (anti-amphiphysin positive) often has more rapid onset and weight loss. There are rare variants: stiff-limb syndrome (focal limb involvement), progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), and cerebellar ataxia overlap. Natural history without treatment leads to worsening spasms, falls, and functional impairment over 5\u201310 years (median time to wheelchair dependence ~6 years). The 2001 Dalakas criteria require stiffness in axial muscles, episodic spasms, anti-GAD positivity or electrophysiologic evidence of continuous motor unit activity, and exclusion of other causes.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: clinical evaluation of stiffness and spasms; serum anti-GAD65 antibody assay (ELISA sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~95%); anti-amphiphysin testing if paraneoplastic suspicion (sensitivity ~10%, specificity ~99%). Electromyography shows continuous involuntary motor unit activity at rest, suppressed by IV diazepam. Second-tier: tumor screening (mammography, CT chest/abdomen, PET-CT) in anti-amphiphysin cases; CSF analysis may show oligoclonal bands in 50%. Third-tier: in refractory or seronegative cases, immunoblot for gephyrin or glycine receptor antibodies; research assays include GAD65 epitope mapping. Pretest probability of SPS in adult-onset axial stiffness is ~0.5%; positive anti-GAD increases post-test probability to >90%.","management_principles":"Symptomatic therapy: benzodiazepines (diazepam starting at 5 mg TID, titrated up to 60 mg/day) enhance GABAA receptor function (class I, level A). Baclofen (5 mg TID up to 80 mg/day) is an alternative GABAB agonist. Immunotherapy: IV immunoglobulin 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days improves stiffness by 50% at 3 months (Dalakas NEJM 2001); class I, level A. Rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74) has shown benefit in refractory cases (class II, level B). Paraneoplastic SPS requires tumor resection plus immunotherapy. Physical therapy focuses on stretching and fall prevention. Avoid triggers of spasms (stress, startle).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical stiffness using the validated SPS disability scale every 3 months. Check anti-GAD65 titers every 6\u201312 months (although correlation with disease activity is weak). For patients on benzodiazepines, monitor for sedation and tolerance; assess liver function if high-dose baclofen used. Repeat tumor screening annually for 2 years in anti-amphiphysin positive patients. Long-term IVIG maintenance (1 g/kg monthly) can reduce relapses; monitor for infusion reactions and thrombosis. Functional assessments (Timed Up and Go, 6-minute walk test) every 6 months guide therapy adjustments.","clinical_pearls":"1. Anti-GAD65 antibodies are found in 60\u201380% of idiopathic SPS; titers >1,000 IU/mL are highly specific. 2. Amphiphysin antibodies indicate paraneoplastic SPS\u2014always search for breast or small-cell lung cancer. 3. Exaggerated lumbar hyperlordosis (\u2018board-like\u2019 rigidity) is a hallmark sign. 4. Continuous motor unit activity on EMG suppressed by diazepam confirms diagnosis. 5. First-line immunotherapy is IVIG, which yields a 50% functional improvement by 3 months.","references":"1. Dalakas MC, Hohlfeld R.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["NMDA encephalitis","Tardive dyskinesia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"NMDA encephalitis","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (NMDA encephalitis) is correct. Anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis typically affects young females and presents with an initial phase of psychiatric symptoms (depression, social isolation, personality changes, hallucinations), followed by seizures and characteristic movement disorders, most notably orofacial dyskinesias. In contrast, tardive dyskinesia (Option B) arises after months to years of antipsychotic exposure and presents with slow, rhythmic movements of the face and tongue without preceding encephalopathic features or seizures. Multiple series (Dalmau et al. Lancet Neurol 2008;7(12):1091\u20131098) report orofacial dyskinesias in >80% of anti-NMDAR encephalitis cases, whereas tardive dyskinesia requires chronic dopamine blockade over a protracted period (typically >6 months) and does not explain the seizure history or acute psychiatric prodrome.","conceptual_foundation":"Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is classified under ICD-11 code 8D77.0 (Autoimmune encephalitis). It is an antibody-mediated neuropsychiatric disorder with initial psychiatric and behavioral symptoms that often leads to misdiagnosis. The pathognomonic movement disorder (orofacial dyskinesia) distinguishes it from primary psychiatric conditions. Historically first described in young women with ovarian teratomas (Dalmau et al. 2007), recognition has expanded to both sexes and all ages. Differential diagnoses include primary psychosis, viral encephalitis, toxic metabolic encephalopathies, and other autoimmune encephalitides (e.g., anti-LGI1, anti\u2013GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor). Embryologically, NMDA receptors derive from the glutamatergic excitatory system of the telencephalon. Neuroanatomically, the limbic system (hippocampus, amygdala), frontal cortex, and basal ganglia are involved, corresponding to psychiatric, seizure, and movement manifestations. The NMDA receptor complex includes GluN1 and GluN2 subunits; anti-GluN1 IgG antibodies mediate receptor internalization (Hughes et al. Brain 2010).","pathophysiology":"Normal NMDA receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and memory. In anti-NMDAR encephalitis, IgG autoantibodies against the NR1 subunit cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, bind synaptic receptors, and induce internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Hughes et al. 2010). This reduces NMDA receptor density, causing glutamatergic hypofunction, network disinhibition, and excitatory\u2013inhibitory imbalance. The ensuing cascade triggers seizures (excess glutamate release), psychiatric disturbances (limbic system dysfunction), and hyperkinetic movement disorders (basal ganglia involvement). Cytokine release (IL-6, IL-17) and complement activation may amplify neuronal dysfunction. Chronicity leads to synaptic remodeling and persistent deficits if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis follows a characteristic multistage course. Prodrome (flu-like symptoms) occurs in ~70%, followed by acute psychiatric phase (anxiety, psychosis, catatonia) in >90%. Within two weeks, seizures develop in ~75%, and movement disorders (orofacial dyskinesias, choreoathetoid movements) in ~80%. Autonomic instability (hypoventilation, tachycardia, hyperthermia) and decreased consciousness appear later. Untreated, mortality is ~7% (Titulaer et al. Lancet Neurol 2013). Recovery occurs over months to years, with relapse in ~12%. Pediatric cases may lack prominent psychiatric features but show seizures and movement disorders.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing includes CSF analysis (lymphocytic pleocytosis in 80%, oligoclonal bands in 60%) and detection of anti-NMDAR IgG by cell-based assay (sensitivity ~100% in CSF, specificity >95%). Serum testing is less sensitive (~85%). MRI brain is normal in 50\u201360% or shows T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in medial temporal lobes in ~30%. EEG often demonstrates a \u2018delta brush\u2019 pattern in ~30%. Tumor screening (pelvic ultrasound or MRI) should be performed in all females; ovarian teratoma is found in ~50% of adult women. PET-CT may identify occult neoplasms when MRI/ultrasound are negative.","management_principles":"First-line immunotherapy consists of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day \u00d7 5 days), IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day \u00d7 5 days), or plasma exchange (5 exchanges over 10 days) (Graus et al. Lancet Neurol 2016;15(4):391\u2013404). Tumor removal (ovarian teratoma) is essential; teratoma excision within 4 weeks of diagnosis halves the relapse rate (Titulaer et al. 2013). Second-line agents include rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly \u00d74) or cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> monthly). Early initiation (<40 days) correlates with better outcomes (78% good recovery vs. 48% if delayed, p<0.001). Supportive care includes seizure control, management of autonomic instability, and rehabilitation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require outpatient follow-up every 1\u20133 months for the first year, then biannually. Monitor clinical status, repeat CSF antibody titers if relapse suspected, and perform serial imaging for tumor surveillance annually for at least 2 years. Neuropsychological evaluation assesses cognitive recovery. Long-term immunosuppression (azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day or mycophenolate mofetil 1 g BID) may be considered for relapsing cases.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is classically characterized by a relapsing\u2013remitting course (option A) and a typical age at onset between adolescence and middle adulthood (option B). Relapses and remissions are the hallmark of the relapsing\u2013remitting MS (RRMS) subtype, which accounts for approximately 85% of initial presentations (Lublin et al., Neurology 2014). MRI studies reveal new T2 lesions or gadolinium-enhancing lesions corresponding to clinical exacerbations, with resolution or quiescence during remissions (Thompson et al., Lancet Neurol 2018). The typical age of onset spans from early adolescence (\u224811 years) through the fifth decade, with a peak incidence between 20 and 40 years; pediatric onset (<18 years) comprises about 3\u20135% of cases, often beginning around puberty, and late onset (>50 years) remains uncommon (Mowry & Belman, Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep 2020). Option A alone is true but incomplete; option B alone is true but incomplete; option D is incorrect as both A and B correctly describe typical MS features. Therefore, the combined choice (C) accurately captures MS epidemiology and clinical course.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) classified under ICD-11 code 8B21. It falls within the spectrum of immune-mediated demyelinating disorders alongside neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and MOG-IgG-associated disease. DSM-5-TR does not directly classify MS, as it is a neurological rather than psychiatric condition. Historically described by Charcot in 1868, MS has evolved from a purely clinical diagnosis to one grounded in imaging and immunopathology. The 2017 McDonald criteria emphasize dissemination in time and space confirmed by MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings (Thompson et al., Lancet Neurol 2018). Embryologically, oligodendrocytes arise from neural progenitors in the ventricular zone during gestation, migrating to myelinate CNS axons; aberrant immune recognition of myelin antigens in genetically predisposed individuals (HLA-DRB1*15:01) triggers the cascade leading to MS lesions (Dendrou et al., Nat Rev Immunol 2015). Neuroanatomically, lesions predominate in periventricular white matter, corpus callosum, brainstem, cerebellar peduncles, spinal cord, and optic nerves, following venous drainage patterns. Key neurotransmitter and receptor systems implicated include glutamate excitotoxicity, microglial activation via toll-like receptors, and B-cell antigen presentation. Understanding these foundations is critical to appreciating the heterogeneous clinical manifestations and guiding diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","pathophysiology":"Normal CNS physiology relies on oligodendrocyte-produced myelin sheaths to enable rapid saltatory conduction. In MS, peripheral autoreactive CD4+ T-helper 1 and T-helper 17 cells breach the blood\u2013brain barrier via upregulated adhesion molecules (VCAM-1/integrins), releasing proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1). This activates resident microglia and astrocytes, leading to demyelination, oligodendrocyte apoptosis, and axonal transection (Reich et al., N Engl J Med 2018). B cells contribute through antigen presentation, antibody production against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and myelin basic protein (MBP), and cytokine secretion (e.g., lymphotoxin). Chronic lesions exhibit remyelination attempts by oligodendrocyte precursor cells, though often incomplete, resulting in gliosis and permanent axonal loss. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows elevated choline (membrane turnover) and reduced N-acetylaspartate (neuronal integrity). The relapsing\u2013remitting pattern reflects focal immune attacks with partial recovery, whereas secondary progressive MS arises when remyelination and repair mechanisms fail, shifting to neurodegeneration-dominant pathology (Lublin et al., Neurology 2014).","clinical_manifestation":"MS presentations are protean, reflecting lesion location. Optic neuritis occurs in 20\u201330% at onset, presenting with painful monocular vision loss and impaired color vision. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia from medial longitudinal fasciculus lesions produces horizontal diplopia. Spinal cord lesions cause transverse myelitis with sensory level, motor weakness, spasticity, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. Cerebellar involvement yields ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Lhermitte\u2019s sign (electric shock\u2013like sensation on neck flexion) is seen in ~33%. Sensory disturbances (paresthesias, numbness) affect ~50% at onset. Heat sensitivity (Uhthoff\u2019s phenomenon) transiently worsens symptoms. Fatigue is the most common chronic complaint (~80% of patients), often disproportionate to disability. MS follows distinct courses: relapsing\u2013remitting (\u224885%), secondary progressive (SPMS) evolving after years of RRMS, primary progressive (\u224810\u201315%) with gradual decline, and progressive-relapsing (rare). Pediatric MS often presents with polysymptomatic onset and higher relapse rates. Geriatric onset (>50 years) may mimic progressive forms and demands careful differential diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is based on demonstrating dissemination in space and time per 2017 McDonald criteria (Thompson et al., Lancet Neurol 2018). First-tier investigations include contrast-enhanced brain and spinal MRI: T2 hyperintense lesions in \u22652 of 4 CNS regions (periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal cord) establish dissemination in space (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). Dissemination in time is shown by simultaneous gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions or new T2/gadolinium-enhancing lesions on follow-up (~3 months later). CSF analysis for oligoclonal IgG bands adds diagnostic certainty when MRI is equivocal (95% specificity, 85% sensitivity). Evoked potentials (visual, somatosensory, brainstem auditory) may reveal subclinical lesions. First-tier differential diagnoses include neuromyelitis optica (anti-AQP4 antibodies), MOG-IgG disease, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, small-vessel ischemic disease, and sarcoidosis. Second-tier tests (e.g., serum neurofilament light chain, advanced imaging like DIR MRI) are used in atypical cases or research settings. A thorough workup excludes mimics before confirming MS.","management_principles":"Management comprises acute relapse therapy and long-term disease-modifying treatment (DMT). Acute relapses are treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g daily \u00d73\u20135 days; Class I, Level A), which accelerates recovery but does not alter long-term disability (Goodin et al., Neurology 2015). Plasma exchange (five to seven exchanges over 10\u201314 days) is indicated for steroid-refractory relapses (Class II). First-line DMTs for RRMS include interferon-beta-1a/b, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, and teriflunomide (Class I evidence for reducing annualized relapse rate by ~30\u201350%). Second-line therapies (natalizumab, fingolimod, alemtuzumab) are reserved for highly active disease due to higher efficacy (~70% relapse reduction) but increased risk profiles. Emerging agents (ocrelizumab for PPMS, siponimod for SPMS) target B cells and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, respectively. Symptomatic management addresses spasticity (baclofen, tizanidine), neuropathic pain (gabapentin, duloxetine), bladder dysfunction (oxybutynin), fatigue (amantadine), and depression. Rehabilitation, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy optimize function.","follow_up_guidelines":"Long-term monitoring includes clinical assessment and MRI surveillance. Neurological exams are recommended every 6\u201312 months; MRI of the brain (and spinal cord if indicated) at baseline, 6\u201312 months after DMT initiation, then annually or if clinical or radiological activity occurs (Montalban et al., Mult Scler 2018). Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) quantifies disability at each visit. Laboratory monitoring for DMT safety varies by agent: liver function tests, complete blood count, and lymphocyte subsets every 3\u20136 months. Annual screening for JC virus antibody index guides natalizumab risk stratification. Patient-reported outcome measures (MSIS-29, MFIS) assess impact on quality of life. Transition to SPMS is suspected with increasing EDSS \u22654 independent of relapses; confirmation guides therapy adjustment. Vaccination status, bone health, and cardiovascular risk factors should be reviewed regularly. Pregnancy planning requires DMT washout and risk\u2013benefit discussion.","clinical_pearls":"1. Relapsing\u2013remitting MS accounts for ~85% of initial presentations; mnemonic \u201cRR for Relapses and Remissions\u201d aids recall. 2. The 2017 McDonald criteria allow MRI demonstration of dissemination in time by simultaneous enhancing and non-enhancing lesions, reducing need for serial imaging. 3. CSF oligoclonal bands are present in ~90% of MS patients and remain positive in chronic disease; absence should prompt evaluation for MS mimics. 4. Pediatric MS often has higher relapse rates but slower disability accrual; consider early high-efficacy therapy in children. 5. Early initiation of DMT reduces the risk of conversion to SPMS by ~30% over 5 years (NNT ~4), underscoring importance of timely diagnosis and treatment.","references":"1.

Natalizumab infusions can precipitate acute infusion reactions, presenting with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and tachypnea. According to prescribing information and post\u2010marketing surveillance (Polman et al. NEJM 2006;354:899\u2013910), immediate cessation of the infusion is mandatory at the first sign of a moderate to severe reaction. Prophylactic measures for subsequent infusions\u2014including premedication with an H1 blocker, H2 blocker, and corticosteroid, plus slowing the infusion rate\u2014reduce the incidence of recurrent reactions (AAN practice guideline, 2018). Option B is incorrect because continuing the infusion in the face of a reaction risks progression to anaphylaxis. Option C is incorrect as dose reduction of natalizumab has no established role in preventing infusion reactions. Option D is incorrect because there is no validated desensitization protocol for natalizumab; instead, standard premedication and slower infusion rates are employed.","conceptual_foundation":"Natalizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting \u03b14\u2010integrin on leukocytes, inhibiting their migration across the blood\u2013brain barrier. It is indicated for relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) after failure of first\u2010line therapies. In the WHO ICD\u201011 classification, MS is coded under 8A40; in DSM\u20105\u2010TR it is categorized under neurocognitive disorders when cognitive impairment ensues. The mechanism of infusion reactions is immunologic, often mediated by cytokine release or IgE\u2010independent mast cell activation. Understanding integrin blockade and leukocyte trafficking is critical to appreciating both efficacy and adverse immune phenomena. Historically, infusion reactions were first noted during early clinical trials in the 1990s; prophylactic strategies evolved from initial rates of 10\u201312% infusion reactions to current rates below 2% when premedication protocols are used.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, integrins on leukocytes bind endothelial VCAM\u20101, facilitating transmigration into tissues. Natalizumab blocks \u03b14\u2010integrin, preventing this adhesion. Infusion reactions arise when immune complexes or aggregated antibody fragments activate complement or trigger mast cell degranulation, leading to release of histamine, leukotrienes, and cytokines (IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1). The result is increased vascular permeability and bronchospasm, causing tachypnea and dyspnea. Tachycardia arises reflexively from hypotension and hypoxia. The temporal progression is acute\u2014symptoms develop within minutes to an hour of infusion. Without prompt cessation, severe reactions can evolve to anaphylaxis with airway compromise and hemodynamic collapse.","clinical_manifestation":"Infusion reactions usually occur during or within two hours of the infusion. Mild reactions include flushing, pruritus, and low\u2010grade fever; moderate to severe reactions manifest as respiratory distress (shortness of breath, bronchospasm), cardiovascular signs (tachycardia, hypotension), and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea). Occurrence rates in unscreened populations reach 5\u201310% for mild reactions and 1\u20132% for severe reactions (Polman et al. 2006). In RRMS patients, the peak incidence is at the first three infusions; recurrent reactions are less common with prophylaxis. Risk factors include prior hypersensitivity, high infusion rate (>300 mL/hr), and absence of premedication.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical. Assess vital signs continuously during infusion. First\u2010tier evaluation includes pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and auscultation for wheezing. Laboratory workup is not routinely required unless anaphylaxis is suspected\u2014in which case serum tryptase within 1\u20132 hours can confirm mast cell activation (sensitivity ~60%, specificity ~90%). Differential includes pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm from other causes, and cardiac ischemia; these are excluded by bedside ultrasound, D\u2010dimer, ECG, and troponin as indicated. Pretest probability of infusion reaction in a patient on natalizumab is high in the first three infusions; post\u2010test probability after observing respiratory signs approaches 95%.","management_principles":"Immediate management: stop the infusion, maintain airway patency, administer high\u2010flow oxygen and intravenous H1 antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine 25\u201350 mg), H2 blocker (e.g., ranitidine 50 mg), and methylprednisolone 125 mg IV. For bronchospasm, administer nebulized albuterol. Monitor hemodynamics and provide IV fluids if hypotensive. For future infusions, guidelines recommend premedication 30\u201360 minutes prior with methylprednisolone 125 mg IV, diphenhydramine 25\u201350 mg IV, and ranitidine 50 mg IV, and extend infusion duration from 1 hour to 2 hours (AAN Level B recommendation, 2018). Discontinue permanently if anaphylaxis occurs.","follow_up_guidelines":"After a moderate reaction, subsequent infusions should incorporate premedication and slowed infusion. Monitor for recurrent symptoms; if another moderate reaction occurs despite prophylaxis, consider discontinuation. Baseline and periodic pulmonary function tests are not indicated for mild to moderate reactions but may be used if persistent respiratory symptoms develop. Document all adverse events in the patient\u2019s record and in pharmacovigilance registries. Re\u2010evaluate MS disease activity clinically and radiographically within 3\u20136 months of resuming therapy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Infusion reactions to natalizumab most often occur within the first three infusions; premedicate thereafter. 2. Always stop the infusion at first sign of respiratory compromise before administering supportive measures. 3. There is no validated desensitization protocol; use prophylactic antihistamines, corticosteroids, and extended infusion times instead. 4. Measure serum tryptase within 1\u20132 hours if anaphylaxis is suspected; elevated levels support mast cell\u2013mediated reaction. 5.
