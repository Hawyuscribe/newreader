Sneddon disease is defined by the combination of livedo reticularis and recurrent cerebral ischemia due to a noninflammatory arteriopathy of medium-sized arteries. Option B (Antiphospholipid syndrome) also causes strokes and livedo but requires positive antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombotic events. Options C (Atherosclerotic stroke) and D (Lacunar infarct) do not present with livedo reticularis.","conceptual_foundation":"Sneddon disease is categorized under noninflammatory cerebrovascular disorders in ICD-11 (8B22.11). It primarily affects young to middle-aged women and is distinct from vasculitides. Differential includes APS, systemic lupus erythematosus\u2013associated vasculopathy, and other cutaneous vasculopathies.","pathophysiology":"The arteriopathy features intimal proliferation and thrombosis in medium-sized arteries of skin and brain, leading to cutaneous cyanotic netlike pattern and cerebral infarcts. Unlike APS, immune complexes and antiphospholipid antibodies are absent.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop livedo reticularis often before neurologic symptoms. Recurrent transient ischemic attacks or strokes manifest as focal deficits. Cognitive decline may ensue over time.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by skin biopsy showing noninflammatory intimal thickening of arterioles and MRI demonstrating multiple cortical and subcortical infarcts. Antiphospholipid antibodies are negative.","management_principles":"Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75\u2013325 mg daily) is recommended. Anticoagulation is reserved for overlapping APS. Control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia is important.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual dermatology and neurology assessments, MRI surveillance every 1\u20132 years, monitor for cognitive changes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Livedo reticularis with stroke in a young patient suggests Sneddon disease. 2. Negative antiphospholipid antibodies distinguish it from APS. 3. Skin biopsy confirms diagnosis. 4. Sneddon patients often develop vascular dementia. 5. Long-term antiplatelet therapy reduces stroke risk.","references":"1. Sneddon IB. Brain. 1965;88(3):545-562.\n2. Franc\u00e8s C et al.

Occlusion of the right vertebral artery can produce a medial medullary (anterior spinal artery) infarct on the right side, leading to contralateral hemiparesis and loss of proprioception with ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction (tongue weakness). Option B (Left vertebral artery) would cause left-sided tongue deviation. Option C (Basilar artery) infarcts typically cause bilateral cranial nerve deficits or 'locked-in' syndrome. Option D (Anterior cerebral artery) infarcts produce contralateral leg weakness and frontal lobe signs, not brainstem findings.","conceptual_foundation":"Medial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is due to ischemia of the medial medulla, supplied by a branch of the anterior spinal artery arising from the vertebral arteries. It involves the pyramidal tract, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nerve/root exit zone.","pathophysiology":"Ischemia in the medial medulla injures corticospinal fibers causing contralateral weakness, impairs dorsal column fibers in the medial lemniscus causing contralateral loss of proprioception and vibration, and damages the hypoglossal nucleus/fibers causing ipsilateral tongue paralysis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely with contralateral hemiparesis (arm and leg), contralateral loss of proprioception, and ipsilateral tongue deviation toward the lesion. Dysarthria or dysphagia may accompany if nearby structures are involved.","diagnostic_approach":"Diffusion-weighted MRI reveals a diffusion restriction in the medial medulla. MR angiography or CT angiography shows occlusion of the vertebral artery or anterior spinal artery branch. Clinical localization is key to guide imaging.","management_principles":"Treat as acute ischemic stroke: intravenous thrombolysis if within 4.5 hours, consider endovascular therapy if large vessel occlusion and within window. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy and vascular risk factor optimization.","follow_up_guidelines":"Conduct neurorehabilitation for motor deficits and speech therapy for dysarthria. Repeat vascular imaging at 3\u20136 months to assess vessel patency and collateral formation. Monitor blood pressure, lipids, and glucose.","clinical_pearls":"1. Ipsilateral tongue weakness localizes to medial medullary infarct. 2. Contralateral proprioceptive loss distinguishes it from lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome. 3.

What is the treatment?","options":["Antiplatelets","Antibiotics","Thrombolytics","Corticosteroids"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Antibiotics","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The combination of fever and a new pansystolic murmur in a stroke patient is highly suggestive of infective endocarditis leading to cardioembolic stroke. AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines classify infective endocarditis\u2013related stroke as a contraindication to thrombolytics due to high risk of hemorrhagic transformation. The recommended approach is prompt initiation of intravenous antibiotics targeting common pathogens (e.g., vancomycin plus ceftriaxone) to sterilize vegetations and reduce further embolic events. Antiplatelets and thrombolytics are contraindicated in this context (risk of intracerebral hemorrhage), and corticosteroids have no role in treating endocarditis.","conceptual_foundation":"Stroke is categorized into ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes; ischemic strokes include embolic events from cardiac sources. Infective endocarditis (IE) is listed in ICD-11 under BA41, \u2018Infective endocarditis,\u2019 and can present with cerebral septic emboli. Vegetations form on valves (most commonly mitral) due to bacterial colonization. Historical evolution includes the Duke criteria (first described 1994, modified 2000) emphasizing blood cultures and echocardiography. Differential diagnoses include non\u2010bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and rheumatic carditis.","pathophysiology":"Normal valvular endothelium resists bacterial adhesion. In IE, turbulence or endothelial injury promotes deposition of platelets/fibrin, forming sterile vegetations to which bacteria adhere during bacteremia. Proliferation of bacteria within vegetations leads to septic emboli that occlude cerebral arteries. Inflammatory cytokines and immune complexes further damage vessel walls, predisposing to hemorrhage. Antibiotics penetrate vegetations and eradicate bacteria, reducing embolic risk.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with fever, new cardiac murmurs, signs of septic embolization (e.g., stroke, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions). Cerebral septic emboli often produce sudden focal deficits, with watershed or cortical infarcts on MRI. Duke criteria (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%) guide diagnosis: 2 major (positive blood cultures, positive echocardiogram) or 1 major + 3 minor criteria.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Three sets of blood cultures before antibiotics; transthoracic echocardiography (TTE; sensitivity 60\u201370%) followed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE; sensitivity >90%) if TTE is negative. Brain MRI to detect embolic infarcts. Laboratory: elevated ESR/CRP. Second-tier: PET-CT or radionuclide studies for prosthetic valve infection. Avoid thrombolysis if IE suspected.","management_principles":"Begin empiric IV antibiotics (vancomycin + ceftriaxone) pending cultures, then tailor therapy for 4\u20136 weeks based on sensitivities (AHA Class I recommendation). Anticoagulation is generally avoided due to bleeding risk. Surgical valve replacement is indicated for heart failure, uncontrolled infection, or large vegetations (>10 mm) with recurrent emboli.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor blood cultures every 48\u201372 hours until negative. Repeat TEE after 2 weeks if clinical response is inadequate. Weekly renal and hepatic panels to monitor antibiotic toxicity. Neurology follow-up for stroke rehabilitation and secondary prevention, including blood pressure and lipid management.","clinical_pearls":"1. New murmur + fever in stroke patient = infective endocarditis until proven otherwise. 2. Thrombolysis is contraindicated in IE-related stroke. 3. TEE is more sensitive than TTE for detecting vegetations. 4. Early antibiotics reduce risk of further emboli. 5. Large vegetations (>10 mm) may require surgical removal.","references":"1.

What should you do?","options":["Perform a pulmonary CT angiogram","Consider a case of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome ## Page 6"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Neither option addresses the critical next step. Petechiae on the lips in a patient with multiple intracerebral hemorrhages on aspirin suggests thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction rather than pulmonary embolism or hereditary telangiectasia. The appropriate action is prompt platelet count and coagulation studies, review of antiplatelet use, and correction of any coagulopathy. Option A (pulmonary CT angiogram) is irrelevant to intracranial bleeding. Option B (Osler-Weber-Rendu) involves mucocutaneous telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations without generalized petechiae or aspirin-related hemorrhage and would not present acutely with multiple hemorrhages in the brain.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) risk factors include hypertension, antithrombotic use, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and coagulopathies. Aspirin increases bleeding risk by irreversible platelet cyclooxygenase inhibition. Petechiae indicate platelet count < 50 \u00d710^9/L or severe dysfunction. In the ICD-11, ICH is coded under 8B00. Differential includes amyloid angiopathy, AVM rupture, anticoagulant\u2010associated hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenic hemorrhages.","pathophysiology":"Aspirin irreversibly acetylates platelet COX-1, reducing thromboxane A2 and impairing platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelet (7\u201310 days). This antiplatelet effect heightens bleeding risk in microvascular beds, leading to petechial hemorrhages when platelet counts or function are severely compromised. Multiple intracerebral hemorrhages suggest diffuse microangiopathy or coagulopathy, not pulmonary embolic disease or hereditary telangiectasia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with aspirin-associated intracerebral bleeding present with focal neurological deficits, headache, decreased consciousness, and signs of bleeding diathesis such as mucosal petechiae. Petechiae on the lips or skin are a hallmark of platelet dysfunction or severe thrombocytopenia (< 20 \u00d710^9/L).","diagnostic_approach":"Immediate noncontrast head CT confirms hemorrhage. Laboratory evaluation must include complete blood count (platelets), PT/INR, aPTT, bleeding time, and platelet function assays. Platelet transfusion may be indicated if count < 50 \u00d710^9/L. No role for pulmonary CT angiogram. Genetic testing for OWR (ENG, ACVRL1 genes) is for chronic telangiectasia evaluation, not acute ICH.","management_principles":"Management follows AHA/ASA ICH guidelines: discontinue antiplatelet agents, consider platelet transfusion if platelets < 75 \u00d710^9/L (Class IIa), control blood pressure (target systolic < 140 mm Hg), intracranial pressure management, and neurosurgical evaluation for hematoma evacuation if indicated. Correction of coagulopathy is paramount.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor with serial head CTs over 24\u201348 h. Reassess platelet function and count daily until stable. Long-term follow-up includes imaging for underlying vascular lesions if any, and careful decision\u2010making on reinitiating antithrombotic therapy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Petechiae in ICH suggest platelet dysfunction, not hereditary telangiectasia. 2. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelets\u2014effects last 7\u201310 days. 3. Platelet transfusion can be lifesaving in antiplatelet-associated ICH. 4. DO NOT perform pulmonary CT in ICH without pulmonary signs. 5.

Pyridoxine supplementation lowers homocysteine levels and reduces thrombotic risk. Aspirin (B), warfarin (C), and clopidogrel (D) address platelet aggregation/coagulation but do not correct the underlying metabolic defect.","conceptual_foundation":"Homocystinuria is an inherited metabolic disorder (ICD-11: 5A23.0) due to CBS deficiency, leading to elevated homocysteine and methionine. Clinical features include marfanoid habitus, lens dislocation, osteoporosis, thromboembolism, and intellectual disability. Approximately 50\u201360% of patients are pyridoxine-responsive.","pathophysiology":"CBS catalyzes homocysteine \u2192 cystathionine using vitamin B6 as a cofactor. Deficiency leads to accumulation of homocysteine, which promotes endothelial dysfunction via oxidative stress and procoagulant effects. Elevated homocysteine increases platelet aggregation and vascular smooth muscle proliferation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in childhood with skeletal abnormalities, ocular lens subluxation, developmental delay, and thrombotic events (venous and arterial). Stroke in young patients with marfanoid habitus is a red flag for homocystinuria.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnostic workup includes plasma total homocysteine (>100 \u00b5mol/L), elevated methionine, and genetic testing for CBS mutations. B6-provocation tests measure homocysteine reduction with pyridoxine.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is high-dose pyridoxine (100\u2013500 mg/day) with low-methionine diet and folate supplementation to normalize homocysteine. Non-responsive patients require betaine.
