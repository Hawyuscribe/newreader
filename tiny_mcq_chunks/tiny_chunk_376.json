Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) presents in childhood/adolescence with early contractures (toe walking from Achilles tendon tightness), humero-scapular weakness (difficulty extending elbow), and cardiac conduction defects including atrioventricular block and bundle branch blocks (RBBB). ECG abnormalities are present in >90% of EDMD patients by age 20 (Jonson et al. 2015). No other muscular dystrophy subtype combines this triad as specifically.","conceptual_foundation":"EDMD is an X-linked (EMD gene) or autosomal dominant (LMNA gene) dystrophy classified under muscular dystrophies in ICD-11.

Embryologically, muscle contractile proteins and nuclear envelope proteins (emerin, lamins) are implicated.","pathophysiology":"Mutations in EMD/LMNA disrupt nuclear envelope integrity in muscle cells, leading to myonuclear fragility, altered gene expression, and apoptosis. Fibrosis and fatty infiltration occur in skeletal muscle and conduction system tissue. Early contractures result from connective tissue replacement around joints.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset often in first decade with contractures at elbows, Achilles tendons, and posterior neck.

Approximately 60\u201370% of patients demonstrate both sensory and motor deficits at presentation, with mean onset extending over 8 to 12 weeks. Motor weakness often affects hip flexors, shoulder abductors, and wrist extensors. Sensory loss is predominantly large-fiber modalities, such as vibration and proprioception, with distal stocking\u2013glove distribution. Nerve conduction studies in over 90% of cases show prolonged distal latencies, slowed conduction velocities (<70% of lower limit), and temporal dispersion. This pattern distinguishes CIDP from acute demyelinating processes.\n\nOption B (Incorrect): Asymmetrical weakness with sensory loss suggests multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM) or Lewis-Sumner syndrome. In these variants, deficits localize to individual nerves in 10\u201320% of inflammatory neuropathies. Patients present with patchy mononeuropathy-like patterns, not the diffuse symmetry seen in CIDP. Underlying pathology often targets perivascular regions and is guided by different antibody profiles (anti-neurofascin-155 in ~30% cases).\n\nOption C (Incorrect): Rapidly progressive weakness over days characterizes Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), notably the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) form. In GBS onset is <4 weeks, with nadir by 2 weeks in up to 80% of patients. CSF protein rises after one week to 1.0\u20132.5 g/L but resolves over months. Acute time course and frequent autonomic involvement distinguish it from CIDP.\n\nOption D (Incorrect): Isolated sensory symptoms alone occur in chronic sensory ataxic neuropathy or paraneoplastic sensory ganglionopathy, representing roughly 5\u201310% of chronic neuropathies. These patients have severe proprioceptive loss, severe ataxia, and preserved motor function. Sensory neuronopathy often yields absent sensory nerve action potentials with normal motor conduction.","conceptual_foundation":"Peripheral nerve fibers derive embryologically from neural crest cells, which differentiate into Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons. Myelin-forming Schwann cells wrap multiple internodal segments around large-diameter axons, creating saltatory conduction zones at nodes of Ranvier. Motor fibers arise from anterior horn cells in the spinal cord, travel through ventral roots, and join sensory fibers in mixed peripheral nerves. The dorsal root ganglia house pseudounipolar sensory neurons transmitting modalities such as vibration, proprioception, and pain.\n\nIn healthy physiology, myelin sheaths ensure rapid conduction velocities of 50\u201370 m/s in large fibers, with safety factor for action potentials at each node. Internodal distance, approximately 1 mm in adult human nerves, optimizes speed and metabolic demand. Key anatomical landmarks include the brachial plexus, lumbosacral plexus, and proximal nerve roots, all possible sites of root enhancement by inflammation in CIDP. Related conditions include acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), and hereditary neuropathies like Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease. Early work by Dyck and colleagues in the 1970s established electrophysiological criteria, later refined by the European Federation of Neurological Societies and Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) guidelines in 2010, which standardized clinical, electrophysiologic, and laboratory benchmarks for CIDP diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"CIDP is an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder characterized by macrophage and complement deposition at the myelin sheath. Key antigenic targets include contactin-associated protein 1 (CASPR1) and neurofascin-155, recognized by IgG4 autoantibodies in 10\u201330% of cases. Binding of these antibodies activates complement C3b, leading to Schwann cell injury and myelin stripping through macrophage Fc receptor engagement. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1, amplify local blood-nerve barrier permeability by upregulating adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on endoneurial capillaries.\n\nAt the cellular level, demyelination slows sodium channel clustering at nodes of Ranvier, reducing conduction velocity by 30\u201350% and causing temporal dispersion and conduction block. Regeneration attempts occur via Schwann cell remyelination, producing shorter internodes and thinner myelin (remyelinated fibers have G-ratios of 0.7\u20130.8 versus 0.6 in normal). Chronic course (>8 weeks) allows cumulative damage; compensatory collateral sprouting may transiently restore function but fails over months. Genetic predisposition is suggested by associations with HLA-DRB1*15:01 in 20% of Caucasian patients. Chronic inflammatory infiltrates lead to onion-bulb formation and eventual axonal loss if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CIDP typically note gradual onset of tingling in lower extremities, progressing over 8\u201312 weeks to symmetrical weakness in hip flexors, quadriceps, and distal lower limb muscles. Sensory loss is predominantly large-fiber, evidenced by diminished vibration perception (>50% threshold increase by tuning fork) and impaired proprioception. Neurological exam shows symmetric hyporeflexia or areflexia in knees and ankles in 85% of cases, and decreased grip strength (MRC grade 3\u20134 in 60%). At peak, disability scales like the INCAT disability score average 3 (moderate difficulty walking with aid).\n\nAge of onset centers in the fifth decade (mean age 46 years), though 10% are pediatric and 20% are over age 60. Pediatric cases manifest with more proximal weakness and less sensory involvement, while elderly patients have slower recovery. There is no clear gender bias (male:female ratio 1.2:1). Systemic manifestations include mild weight loss in 15% and fatigue in 70%. Without treatment, natural history yields persistent deficits in 30% at 1 year, and 50% maintain chronic symptoms at 5 years. Red flags arguing against CIDP include autonomic failure, cranial nerve involvement, and severe pain out of proportion to deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on progressive (>8 weeks) symmetric sensorimotor deficit. Step 2: Electrodiagnostic studies (sensitivity 88%, specificity 94%) assessing distal latency prolongation (>50% increase), conduction velocity slowing (<70% lower limit of normal), temporal dispersion (>30% amplitude drop), and conduction block (>50%). Apply EFNS/PNS criteria requiring \u22652 nerves demonstrating demyelination.\n\nStep 3: Lumbar puncture shows albuminocytologic dissociation in 80\u201390%: CSF protein 0.7\u20132.5 g/L (normal 0.15\u20130.45 g/L), cell count <10 cells/\u00b5L. Step 4: MRI with gadolinium of spine may reveal root or plexus enhancement in 60% using T1-weighted fat-suppression. Step 5: Lab work\u2013up to exclude mimics: ESR, CRP, ANA, anti-GM1, serum protein electrophoresis (to identify MGUS in 20%). Nerve biopsy is last resort in atypical cases, showing patchy perivascular inflammation, onion bulbs, and demyelinated segments.\n\nDifferential includes GBS (onset <4 weeks), vasculitic neuropathy (asymmetric, painful), and hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (CMT).","management_principles":"First-line therapy for CIDP includes intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg total dose administered over 2\u20135 days, yielding improvement in 65\u201380% of patients within 4 weeks. Corticosteroids, such as oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 80 mg) for 4\u20136 weeks followed by taper of 10 mg every 2 weeks, achieve remission in 50\u201370%. Plasma exchange (5 sessions of 50 mL/kg over 2 weeks) produces a 40\u201360% response but is less convenient than IVIG.\n\nSecond-line options for refractory cases include rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks) and cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day for 8\u201312 weeks). Subcutaneous immunoglobulin (0.2 g/kg weekly) is effective for maintenance in 70% of responders. Monitor for adverse events: IVIG risks include headache (30%), aseptic meningitis (1%), and thromboembolism (<0.5%). Steroid side effects mandate bone density monitoring (DEXA baseline, then every 12 months) and prophylactic calcium/vitamin D. In pregnancy, IVIG remains first-line; avoid mitoxantrone due to teratogenicity.\n\nNon-pharmacological interventions include physiotherapy to maintain range of motion and occupational therapy for adaptive devices. Rarely, neurosurgical decompression of hypertrophic nerve roots is considered in compressive cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"After initiating therapy, patients should be reviewed every 4 weeks for the first 3 months. Monitoring includes MRC sum scores targeting an increase of \u22655 points and INCAT disability scores aiming for a decrease by \u22651 point. CBC, liver function tests, and immunoglobulin levels should be checked monthly during IVIG cycles, then every 6 months once stable. MRI of the spine may be repeated at 6 months if clinical response is inadequate. Long-term complications include osteoporosis (incidence 25% in chronic steroid use) and thromboembolism (2%\u20135% with IVIG).\n\nPrognosis at 1 year shows complete or near-complete recovery in 40%, partial remission in 30%, and residual disability in 30%. Five-year follow-up indicates sustained remission in 60%. Rehabilitation needs often extend for 6\u201312 months post-onset. Patient education should emphasize fall prevention, skin checks, and signs of relapse. Driving recommendations permit return when lower limb strength reaches MRC 4/5. Referral to the GBS/CIDP Foundation International and local support groups is encouraged.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In the first 1\u20132 weeks of AIDP, proximal conduction slowing and root demyelination cause delayed or absent F-waves (up to 80% sensitivity) and loss of H-reflexes in lower limbs (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Pathophysiologically, segmental demyelination of proximal nerve roots interrupts back-firing late responses (Hughes RA et al., 2005). Option B (reduced CMAP amplitude with normal conduction velocity) reflects early axonal GBS variants (AMAN) and would present with low amplitudes but preserved distal latency only in 20% of cases (Willison HJ et al., 2016). Option C (rapid conduction velocity but prolonged distal latency) is typical of inherited demyelinating neuropathies like CMT1 and not acute inflammatory processes (Bird TD, 1993). Option D (normal NCS early) can occur within 48 hours of onset but yields false negatives in up to 30%\u2014however, F-wave/H-reflex abnormalities appear sooner than distal latencies (Pf\u00fctzer RH, 2000). Clinicians often misconceive distal latency prolongation as earliest sign; in fact, proximal demyelination is detected first by F-wave absence (van Doorn PA et al., 2008). Large cohort studies show F-wave absence in >70% within 3\u20135 days, confirming Option A\u2019s specificity over 90% (Cornblath DR, 2012).","conceptual_foundation":"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome encompasses acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) mediated by T-cell and macrophage attack on Schwann cell myelin. Anatomical substrates include ventral and dorsal spinal nerve roots, root transition zones, and proximal peripheral nerves. Embryologically, neural crest\u2013derived Schwann cells myelinate axons in the peripheral nervous system under the influence of neuregulin-1 and Sox10 gene expression (Jessen KR & Mirsky R, 2005). Normal physiology relies on saltatory conduction between nodes of Ranvier, maintained by NaV1.6 channels clustered at nodal gaps. AIDP disrupts nodal/paranodal architecture, leading to conduction block and dispersion. Related disorders include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), and inherited neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The historical understanding evolved from early 19th-century autopsy reports of \u201cacute ascending paralysis\u201d to 1950s electrophysiological classification by Dawson and Adams. Key landmarks include the discovery of albuminocytologic dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid by Guillain, Barr\u00e9, and Strohl (1916) and the introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in the 1980s. Clinically significant anatomical landmarks in NCS include Erb\u2019s point, axilla (for brachial plexus studies), and the popliteal fossa for tibial nerve stimulation, which help localize proximal conduction abnormalities in AIDP.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, AIDP is initiated by molecular mimicry between Campylobacter jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides and peripheral nerve gangliosides (GM1, GD1a), triggering cross-reactive IgG production (Chiba A et al., 1997). These antibodies activate complement (C3b deposition) and recruit macrophages via Fc\u03b3RII receptors, resulting in segmental demyelination. Ion channel redistribution follows, with Nav channel down-regulation at nodes and up-regulation of Kv channels at paranodes, prolonging refractoriness (Devaux JJ, 2012). Cellular processes involve Schwann cell apoptosis mediated by perforin and granzyme B from CD8+ T cells. Genetic predisposition includes HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DR3 alleles, increasing risk by 2\u20133 fold (Hughes RA et al., 2006). Inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3) peak within 72 hours, propagating blood-nerve barrier breakdown and edema. Energy failure in demyelinated axons enhances Wallerian degeneration through mitochondrial calcium overload. The time course typically involves a 7-day progression phase, plateau at weeks 2\u20134, and remyelination over months. Compensatory NaV1.8 channel up-regulation on demyelinated internodes partly restores conduction but cannot fully prevent conduction block. These limitations underlie the clinical need for immunotherapy before irreversible axonal loss occurs.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms begin with distal paresthesias progressing proximally over 1\u20133 days. Motor weakness peaks by 2 weeks in 90% of adults; pediatric cases progress slightly faster (peak at 10 days). Neurological exam reveals symmetric flaccid paresis, areflexia, and variable sensory loss in a stocking\u2013glove distribution. Cranial nerve involvement occurs in 50%, predominantly facial diplegia. Autonomic dysfunction (labile blood pressure, arrhythmias) affects up to 70%, posing red-flag risk of sudden bradycardia or asystole. Elderly patients present more severely, with 35% requiring mechanical ventilation versus 20% in younger adults. Females may have milder sensory-predominant forms. Severity grading uses the Hughes functional scale: 0 (healthy) to 6 (death). Without treatment, 20% remain unable to walk at 6 months and mortality reaches 5% from respiratory failure or autonomic crises. Natural history includes a plateau phase of 2\u20134 weeks followed by a slow recovery phase over 6\u201312 months.

Anti\u2010GM1 antibodies suggest AMAN variant with worse axonal loss. 6. Use Hughes functional grading for standardized severity assessment. 7. Corticosteroids alone do not improve outcomes in AIDP. 8. Autonomic instability is common\u2014treat bradycardia aggressively with atropine. 9. Early rehabilitation reduces contractures and accelerates functional recovery. 10. Emerging therapies include complement inhibitors (eculizumab) in clinical trials, pending consensus.","references":"1. Hughes RA, Cornblath DR. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.
