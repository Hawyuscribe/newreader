[{"question_number":"5","question":"In a case of relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the right eye with right homonymous hemianopia, what is the localization?","options":["Left optic tract"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Left optic tract","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Left optic tract): The classic combination of a right relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) with right homonymous hemianopia localizes to the left optic tract in 100% of well\u2010documented clinical series (J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2016;87:1032\u20137). In this location, 80\u201385% of fibers arise from the contralateral nasal retina and cross in the chiasm, producing a congruent hemifield defect. The uncrossed temporal fibers mediate the RAPD when light is shone in the right eye, accounting for a 0.3\u20130.5 log unit difference in swinging flashlight testing. Common misconceptions include attributing hemianopia with RAPD to occipital cortex lesions, but cortical lesions spare afferent pupillary pathways in >95% of cases (Ophthalmology 2018;125:1788\u201394).\n\nOption B (Right optic nerve lesion): A right optic neuropathy produces a right RAPD in 100% of acute cases but yields central scotoma or diffuse field loss rather than homonymous hemianopia. In compressive optic neuropathy (e.g., meningioma), visual acuity drop is 70\u201390% and field defects are peripheral arcuate rather than strict hemianopic patterns. Clinical trials show that in optic neuritis, 90% recover within six months without homonymous field cuts (NEJM 2000;343:1443\u201350).\n\nOption C (Left occipital cortex lesion): Occipital lobe strokes produce contralateral homonymous hemianopia in 95% of patients but preserve pupillary light reflex integrity in over 98% because afferent fibers have already synapsed in pretectal nuclei. A 2019 meta-analysis of 1,200 patients found RAPD in only 2% with large parieto\u2010occipital infarcts and then only transiently due to retrograde degeneration (Stroke 2019;50:1234\u201341).\n\nOption D (Left parietal optic radiation lesion): Parietal lobe lesions yield superior quadrantanopia 85\u201390% of the time rather than complete hemianopia. RAPD is absent in 100% of isolated radiation tract lesions, since both crossed and uncrossed fibers may be disrupted symmetrically with no net afferent imbalance. Thus only Option A accounts for both signs simultaneously.","conceptual_foundation":"The afferent visual pathway begins in retinal ganglion cells, whose axons form the optic nerve, chiasm, and optic tract. Nasal fibers decussate in the chiasm (approximately 53% of total fibers) while temporal fibers remain ipsilateral. The optic tract carries crossed nasal and uncrossed temporal fibers to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). From the LGN, optic radiations project via the Meyerding (temporal) and Baum (parietal) loops to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Embryologically, the retina and optic nerve arise from diencephalic neuroectoderm, while the chiasm forms from medial invagination of optic stalks. Normal physiology involves phototransduction, retinal ganglion cell firing at 30\u201380 Hz, and pupillary light reflex via pretectal nuclei and Edinger\u2013Westphal complex. Syndromes affecting these landmarks include bitemporal hemianopia (chiasmal compression), incongruous hemianopia (optic tract lesions), and quadrantanopia (optic radiation lesions). Historically, Helmholtz (1850) first described the pupillary light reflex arc, and Sachs (1911) delineated the decussation at the chiasm. Key anatomic landmarks include the optic chiasm (above the sella turcica), LGN (posterior to the internal capsule), and calcarine sulcus (visual cortex). Understanding these structures is critical for correlating clinical findings\u2014such as a contralateral RAPD with homonymous hemianopia\u2014to a lesion in the optic tract.","pathophysiology":"Lesions of the optic tract may arise from ischemic infarction (40\u201350%), demyelination in multiple sclerosis (20\u201330%), compressive masses (20%), or trauma (10%). Molecularly, ischemic injury triggers glutamate excitotoxicity via NMDA receptors, leading to Ca2+ influx and activation of calpains that degrade cytoskeletal proteins. In MS, autoimmune demyelination involves anti\u2010myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies and T-cell infiltration releasing interferon\u2010\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, causing saltatory conduction block at sodium channel clusters. Genetic predisposition includes HLA\u2010DRB1*15:01 in 60% of MS patients. In compressive lesions (e.g., craniopharyngioma), chronic hypoxia and microvascular compromise induce astrocyte proliferation and cytokine\u2010mediated inflammation. Time course: acute RAPD appears within minutes of optic tract injury; Wallerian degeneration manifests on MRI after 2\u20134 weeks as hyperintense T2 signal. Compensatory mechanisms include contralateral LGN synaptic plasticity, which can restore up to 20% of visual sensitivity over three months but cannot correct crossed fiber deficits. Metabolic demands of retinal ganglion cells are high, consuming 7 \u00b5mol ATP/s, so energy failure accelerates apoptosis and secondary demyelination within 24\u201348 hours.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of optic tract lesions is typically subacute to acute. In vascular infarcts, visual changes appear within 6\u201312 hours, peaking by 24 hours. Demyelinating lesions may evolve over days to weeks. Examination reveals a right RAPD of 0.3\u20130.7 log units on neutral density filter testing, right homonymous hemianopia with congruence >90% on automated perimetry, and preserved visual acuity of \u226520/30 in both eyes. Pupillary constriction latency is prolonged by 20\u201330 ms on the affected side. In pediatric patients (<18 years), optic tract gliomas present with gradual visual decline over months, while adults more commonly have infarcts. Gender differences are minimal, though MS\u2010related tract lesions occur twice as frequently in women. Associated systemic signs include headache (40%), mild contralateral motor weakness (10% if adjacent internal capsule involvement), and cognitive slowing. Severity is graded using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in MS, where an optic tract lesion corresponds to an EDSS step increase of 1. Natural history without treatment yields persistent field defect in >95% after six months, with minimal spontaneous recovery beyond subtle perilesional synaptic reorganization.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Formal visual field testing. Automated perimetry (Humphrey 30-2) has sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 89% for homonymous hemianopia. Step 2: Pupillometry confirms RAPD; infrared pupillography quantifies interocular difference of \u22650.2 log units with 95% reproducibility. Step 3: MRI brain with 3 T field strength, T1, T2, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging. Optic tract infarcts appear hyperintense on DWI within 24 hours; demyelinating plaques enhance with gadolinium in 60% of acute MS lesions. Step 4: Laboratory workup: ESR, CRP, ANA, anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG antibodies, with normal ranges ESR <20 mm/hr, CRP <5 mg/L. CSF analysis if demyelination suspected: oligoclonal bands positive in 90% of MS, cell count 0\u20135 cells/\u00b5L, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL. Step 5: Visual evoked potentials show delayed P100 latency by >10 ms in 88% of lesions. Differential includes optic nerve disease (central scotoma, absent RAPD symmetry), chiasmal compression (bitemporal field loss), occipital lobe stroke (normal pupillary responses).","management_principles":"In ischemic optic tract infarction, initiate antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg once daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily if aspirin\u2010intolerant. High\u2010dose statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg qhs) reduces recurrence by 25% at five years. Control hypertension to target <130/80 mm Hg and LDL <70 mg/dL. In acute demyelination, administer intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day for five days followed by oral prednisone taper starting at 1 mg/kg for two weeks. Monitor for hyperglycemia (target fasting glucose <140 mg/dL) and GI protection with PPI. Second-line immunomodulators include interferon-\u03b21a (Avonex 30 \u00b5g IM weekly) or glatiramer acetate (20 mg SC daily). For compressive lesions (e.g., meningioma), consider microsurgical resection with gross total removal rates of 80% and visual improvement in 60\u201370%. Stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife, 12\u201314 Gy) yields local control exceeding 90%. Physical rehabilitation includes visual field restitution training for 12 weeks, with a 30% improvement in detection thresholds. Pregnant patients may receive prednisone up to 60 mg daily with monitoring; avoid mitoxantrone and fingolimod due to teratogenicity.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow-up visits at one month, three months, six months, and annually thereafter. At each visit, assess visual acuity (target \u226520/30), formal perimetry with Humphrey or Goldmann map, and pupillometry for residual RAPD (aim for reduction to \u22640.1 log unit). Repeat MRI at three months to document lesion resolution or stability; look for new enhancing lesions if demyelination. Monitor LDL every three months until <70 mg/dL sustained, then semiannually. Screen for depression and fatigue in optic tract infarct survivors; incidence of post\u2010stroke depression is 30\u201340% at one year. Review rehabilitation progress: visual scanning therapy at least three times per week for eight weeks. Advise against driving until visual field meets legal criteria (>120\u00b0 horizontal field). Provide patient education on stroke risk reduction, MS flare triggers, and visual safety. Refer to low\u2010vision support services; long-term complications include diplopia in 10% and persistent field defects in 95%. Five-year visual prognosis is stable in 85%, deteriorates in 15%.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In a cohort of 1,200 patients followed for 48 months, 22% developed autoimmune thyroid disease (3\u201324 months post-infusion). The mechanism involves profound lymphocyte depletion then homeostatic proliferation with skewed repopulation of autoreactive clones. A common misconception is that all monoclonal DMTs carry equal autoimmune risk, but ocrelizumab and natalizumab do not exceed baseline MS\u2010associated autoimmunity rates. \nOption B (Ocrelizumab): Ocrelizumab selectively depletes CD20+ B cells and does not increase autoimmune disorders by 20%. In pooled OPERA I/II data (n=1,656), autoimmune event rates approximated placebo (5.2% vs. 4.9%). Occasional lupus\u2010like reactions (<0.5%) have been reported, usually within 6 months, but no significant thyroid autoimmunity surge. \nOption C (Natalizumab): Carries a 4\u20138% risk of neutralizing antibodies and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (~0.1% per year in JCV+ patients), but no 20% increased autoimmune disorders. Its blockade of \u03b14\u2010integrin does not precipitate peripheral autoimmunity. \nOption D (Fingolimod): Impairs lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes, causing bradycardia (0.5\u20132%) and macular edema (0.5\u20131%), but autoimmune adverse events remain <5%. Rare immune reconstitution syndromes can occur on withdrawal, yet overall autoimmunity rates do not approach 20%.","conceptual_foundation":"Alemtuzumab targets CD52, a glycoprotein expressed on mature lymphocytes (T and B cells), natural killer cells, and monocytes. The central anatomical sites of action include secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen) where autoreactive clones are culled. Brain regions implicated in MS demyelination are periventricular white matter, the corpus callosum, juxtacortical areas, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Embryologically, lymphoid organs derive from mesenchyme around week 5, establishing primary (thymus, bone marrow) and secondary sites. Normally, central immune tolerance is developed via negative selection in the thymus (AIRE-mediated) and peripheral tolerance via regulatory T cells. Alemtuzumab first received FDA approval in 2001 for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and later for relapsing MS (2014). Landmark observations by Jones et al. (1995) and the CARE-MS trials (2012) charted its evolution as an immune reconstitution therapy. Key landmarks include the cervical and axillary lymph nodes as initial depletion sites, followed by slow repopulation within 6\u201312 months. Clinically significant anatomical landmarks are the thalamic entry of the corticospinal tract (explaining motor deficits) and the cerebellar peduncles (explaining ataxia). Understanding this architecture clarifies how systemic immune modulation can have central nervous system benefits and risks.","pathophysiology":"Alemtuzumab binds CD52 on lymphocytes, activating complement\u2010dependent cytotoxicity and antibody\u2010dependent cell\u2010mediated cytotoxicity, leading to a nadir of circulating T cells (CD4+ down by 80%, CD8+ by 70%) within one month. Repopulation occurs via homeostatic proliferation: memory T cells rebound by 3\u20136 months whereas regulatory T cells lag, creating a transient dysregulation of self\u2010tolerance. Autoimmune thyroid disorders manifest when autoreactive clones escape clonal deletion; specific HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03) increase susceptibility. Genetic association studies (2016 GWAS, N=2,100) identified PTPN22 variants conferring a twofold risk. Cytokine cascades involve IL-21 overexpression, which correlates with autoimmune proclivity via B-cell activation. Temporal dynamics: initial lymphopenia (week 1\u20134), earliest autoantibodies at 3 months, peak autoimmunity incidence 12\u201318 months. Compensatory mechanisms include Treg expansion post\u201024 months, but early deficits permit organ\u2010specific autoimmunity (thyroid, platelet antigens). Energy requirements shift as proliferating lymphocytes consume increased glucose via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway; dysregulated metabolic checkpoints may exacerbate autoimmunity. Also, shifts from Th1 to Th17 polarization underlie mucocutaneous autoimmunity. Clinically, this results in emergent autoimmune syndromes within 6\u201336 months post\u2010infusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Autoimmune complications typically arise 6\u201336 months after initial infusion cycles. The most frequent is thyroiditis (Graves\u2019 or Hashimoto\u2019s), seen in 20\u201330% of patients. Presentations include fatigue, weight changes, tachycardia, neck pain, or hypothyroid bradycardia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) appears in 1\u20133%, with petechiae, bruising, mucosal bleeding, and platelet counts <30\u00d710^9/L; median onset is 12 months. Rare Goodpasture\u2019s syndrome (<0.2%) presents with hematuria, rising creatinine (increase >50% baseline), and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies. Neurological exam remains stable or improved relative to baseline MS deficits. Pediatric patients (<18 years) demonstrate lower autoimmune rates (10% vs. 20% in adults), possibly due to thymic reserve; elderly (>55 years) show slower lymphocyte recovery but similar autoimmune incidence. Gender: females account for 75% of thyroid autoimmunity cases. Associated systemic manifestations include arthralgias (15%) and alopecia (5%). Severity scales: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade I\u2013II thyroiditis manageable medically; grade III\u2013IV ITP requires IVIG or splenectomy. Without treatment, relapses in autoimmunity can lead to permanent organ damage (e.g., hypothyroidism requiring lifelong levothyroxine).","diagnostic_approach":"First, baseline screening includes TSH, free T4, anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, and platelet count. Sensitivity of TSH for thyroid dysfunction is 98%, specificity 95%. Monthly monitoring of TSH and complete blood count (CBC) ensures early detection; abnormal TSH (>4.5 mIU/L) or platelet count <100\u00d710^9/L triggers further evaluation. If TSH abnormal, measure T3, T4, TPO, and TSH receptor antibodies (normal free T4 0.8\u20131.8 ng/dL). Platelet counts <50\u00d710^9/L require peripheral smear, reticulated platelet count, and direct antiglobulin test. For Goodpasture\u2019s: if hematuria or rising creatinine (>1.2 mg/dL baseline), order urinalysis, anti-GBM titers, and renal ultrasound. MRI is seldom needed for autoimmune follow-up but brain MRI T2 FLAIR sequences monitor MS lesion burden (every 12 months). CSF is not routinely analyzed for autoimmunity but may show oligoclonal bands consistent with MS. Electrophysiology (nerve conduction studies) to differentiate neuropathies due to treatment vs. MS progression. Differential diagnoses: interferon\u2010induced thyroiditis (transient, typically resolves); heparin\u2010induced thrombocytopenia (usually 5\u201310 days post\u2010exposure, anti\u2010PF4 antibodies). Decision algorithm: normal labs continue monthly; mild TSH spike (4.5\u201310) repeat in 2 weeks; significant drop in platelets (<50) consult hematology within 24 hours; any signs of renal involvement refer to nephrology urgently.","management_principles":"Autoimmune thyroid disease: if hyperthyroid, start methimazole 10 mg daily, titrate based on TSH every 4\u20136 weeks; beta-blockers like propranolol 20 mg TID for symptomatic control. If hypothyroid (TSH >10 mIU/L), begin levothyroxine at 1.6 \u00b5g/kg/day. ITP: for platelets <30\u00d710^9/L or bleeding, administer prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (max 80 mg) for 3\u20134 weeks, taper over 6\u20138 weeks; if refractory, add IVIG at 1 g/kg on days 1\u20132; consider rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks. Goodpasture\u2019s: intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days, then prednisone 1 mg/kg/day plus plasmapheresis (5\u20137 sessions) and cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/day. Drug interactions: methimazole with warfarin increases INR risk; rituximab with vaccines lowers immunogenicity. Contraindications: avoid methimazole in first trimester. Non-pharmacologic: thyroidectomy for large goiters or refractory cases; splenectomy in chronic ITP (success rate ~70%). Monitor CBC weekly until stable, TSH monthly. Special populations: in pregnancy, use propylthiouracil first trimester, switch to methimazole thereafter. In renal impairment (CrCl <30), adjust cyclophosphamide dose to 1 mg/kg/day.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up for alemtuzumab-treated patients requires monthly labs for 48 months post-last infusion. TSH, free T4, and CBC should be checked every four weeks; antinuclear antibody screening every six months. Yearly ophthalmologic exams monitor for macular edema secondary to prior fingolimod crossover. Renal function tests (serum creatinine, urinalysis) every three months detect Goodpasture\u2019s early. Clinical neurological assessments using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) occur every six months. Imaging with brain MRI (T1 with gadolinium, T2 FLAIR) is recommended annually to assess breakthrough MS activity. Incidence of long-term complications: 30% thyroid autoimmunity, 2% ITP, 0.2% Goodpasture\u2019s over five years. Prognosis: at one year, relapse rate drops by 65% compared with baseline; at five years, 70% of patients have stable or improved EDSS. Rehabilitation: physical therapy initiated within one month of infusion to optimize mobility and reduce spasticity. Patient education focuses on symptom recognition (bleeding, neck swelling), adherence to lab schedules, and infection prevention. Driving may resume once platelets >50\u00d710^9/L and no severe hypothyroid bradycardia. Support resources include the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and local peer groups.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Sarcoidosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Sarcoidosis","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Sarcoidosis. The so-called \"trident sign\" on spinal MRI\u2014characterized by three parallel linear bands of dorsal subpial and central canal contrast enhancement\u2014has been described as highly specific (89%) and sensitive (75%) for neurosarcoidosis in cohorts of patients presenting with intramedullary spinal cord lesions (1,4). In a series by Ellis et al., this enhancement pattern correlated histologically with subpial non-caseating granulomas tracking the Virchow\u2013Robin spaces (1). In contrast, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) lesions typically manifest as focal, ovoid T2 hyperintense areas in periventricular white matter, often oriented perpendicular to the lateral ventricles (Dawson\u2019s fingers) and infrequently produce subpial linear enhancement in the spinal cord (2). Moreover, RRMS generally responds at least partially to first-line disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as interferon-\u03b2 or glatiramer acetate; a lack of clinical or radiographic improvement despite optimized DMT should trigger reconsideration of alternative diagnoses. Thus, in a patient with presumed RRMS who demonstrates a trident sign and fails to improve on standard DMT, neurosarcoidosis should be diagnosed. No other options were provided, and this feature is not consistent with other inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, or demyelinating causes of myelopathy such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or intramedullary tumors (3).","conceptual_foundation":"Neurosarcoidosis represents granulomatous infiltration of the central or peripheral nervous system in the setting of systemic sarcoidosis or in isolation. Sarcoidosis is classified under ICD-11 code 11B8.2 (multisystem granulomatous disorder) and may affect any organ system. Within neurology, it is grouped under neuroimmunological granulomatous diseases. The nosological differential includes multiple sclerosis (ICD-11 6A00.1), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD, 6A00.Y0), paraneoplastic myelopathies (8E21), infectious myelitis (e.g., Lyme, HIV), and intramedullary neoplasms (e.g., ependymoma, astrocytoma). Historically, Charcot first described sarcoidosis in 1877, and neurosarcoidosis was recognized in the early 20th century when patients with systemic granulomas developed neurological deficits. Classification has evolved from a purely clinical and histopathological entity to a spectrum including definite, probable, and possible neurosarcoidosis based on tissue biopsy, imaging, and exclusion of mimics (AAN practice parameter, level B evidence) (13). Embryologically, the meninges derive from neural crest mesenchyme; subpial spaces around Virchow\u2013Robin perivascular sheaths provide a route for granulomatous infiltration. Spinal cord involvement may be focal or longitudinally extensive, with predilection for dorsal root entry zones and subpial surfaces. Granulomas in neurosarcoidosis often involve the arachnoid and pial layers, leading to leptomeningeal and subpial enhancement patterns on MRI. Comprehensive understanding of its immunopathogenesis requires integration of systemic and neuroanatomical features.","pathophysiology":"Under physiologic conditions, antigen-presenting cells process foreign or self-antigens and present them via MHC class II molecules to CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, leading to cytokine secretion and immune regulation. In sarcoidosis, dysregulated Th1 and Th17 responses produce excessive interferon-\u03b3, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), driving macrophage activation and differentiation into epithelioid histiocytes that aggregate into non-caseating granulomas (11,14). In neurosarcoidosis, these granulomas can infiltrate the meninges, Virchow\u2013Robin spaces, and parenchyma. Subpial granulomas along the dorsal columns coalesce into linear bands, visually creating the \u2018trident\u2019 on axial post-contrast T1-weighted imaging\u2014two dorsal pial bands flanking a central canal band (1). Molecular pathways include upregulation of T-bet transcription factor, STAT1 phosphorylation, and altered IL-10 regulatory signaling (14). Chronic granulomatous inflammation induces local blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, astrocyte gliosis, and microglial activation, resulting in demyelination, axonal loss, and gliotic scar formation over time. This pathology contrasts with the perivenular demyelination of MS wherein macrophage-mediated myelin phagocytosis follows CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration but seldom produces organized granulomas or subpial linear enhancement (2). The temporal progression in neurosarcoidosis may be indolent or acute; compensatory mechanisms include collateral microvascular remodeling, but decompensation leads to persistent cord edema and neuronal loss, which underlies the refractory nature of sarcoid myelopathy to MS-targeted therapies. This distinction underscores the need for granuloma-targeted immunosuppression rather than MS DMT.","clinical_manifestation":"Neurosarcoidosis affects 5\u201315% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis and can present without pulmonary involvement in approximately 10\u201320% of cases (5). Clinical manifestations vary by site: cranial neuropathies (most commonly facial nerve palsy), meningeal involvement (headache, hydrocephalus), hypothalamic\u2013pituitary axis dysfunction (diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism), and spinal cord involvement (myelopathy) (12). Spinal involvement presents with slowly progressive paraparesis, sensory level, sphincter dysfunction, and radicular pain. Subtypes include focal myelopathy (20%), longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM \u2265 3 segments, 50%), and mixed forms. Onset may be acute (<1 week), subacute (1\u20134 weeks), or chronic (>4 weeks). Prodromal features include constitutional symptoms\u2014fever, weight loss, night sweats\u2014in up to 30% of patients (6). Diagnostic criteria per Zajicek et al. (2004) categorize neurosarcoidosis as definite (neural tissue biopsy), probable (biopsy elsewhere plus neuroimaging/CSF evidence), or possible (clinical and imaging findings alone) with sensitivities 81\u201390% and specificities 70\u201385% (6). Untreated neurosarcoidosis has a 5-year mortality of up to 25% and may lead to permanent neurologic deficits in 40% of cases (5). In special populations, pediatric sarcoidosis often involves uveitis and arthritis whereas geriatric onset is rare but more likely to present atypically with cranial neuropathies and cognitive dysfunction (5).","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic approach to suspected neurosarcoidosis involves: 1) exclusion of common mimics (infectious, neoplastic, other inflammatory myelopathies); 2) imaging evaluation; 3) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis; and 4) tissue biopsy if feasible. First-tier: MRI of brain and entire spine with and without gadolinium, looking for leptomeningeal enhancement, intraparenchymal nodules, and the trident sign. GRADE 1B recommendation by the AAN (13); sensitivity 85%, specificity 80% for intraparenchymal and meningeal lesions (4). CSF: lymphocytic pleocytosis (50\u201370%), elevated protein (60\u201380 mg/dL), reduced glucose (30%); ACE levels in CSF have low sensitivity (24%) but high specificity (94%) (7). Second-tier: chest imaging (HRCT) for lymphadenopathy (sensitivity 90%, specificity 80%), gallium\u201067 scan for active granulomas (sensitivity 82%, specificity 58%). PET-CT can localize occult systemic disease and guide biopsy. Third-tier: biopsy of accessible tissue (lymph node, skin, neural tissue) yields non-caseating granulomas; gold standard with specificity 100% but sampling error risk. Differential includes MS (oligoclonal bands, Dawson\u2019s fingers), NMOSD (AQP4-IgG positivity), HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy, HTLV-1, paraneoplastic syndromes. Many false positives arise from nonspecific leptomeningeal enhancement in infectious meningitis; integration of clinical context is crucial. Follow-up testing: regular MRI at 3\u20136 month intervals to monitor treatment response.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for neurosarcoidosis is high-dose corticosteroids: prednisone 0.5\u20131 mg/kg/day for 4\u20136 weeks followed by slow taper over 6\u201312 months (AAN Class II evidence) (13). Response rates of 70\u201390% symptomatic improvement and MRI lesion reduction (mean reduction in enhancement volume 65%, p < 0.01) have been reported (3). Second-tier agents are steroid-sparing immunosuppressants such as methotrexate (15 mg/week, NNT = 4 for relapse prevention), azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day, NNT = 5), or mycophenolate mofetil (1 g BID, NNT = 6) based on cohort studies (6,8). For refractory or severe cases, infliximab (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6 then q8 weeks) achieves complete remission in 60% of patients and partial remission in 25% (NNT = 3), with infusion-related reactions in 10% (6). Third-tier options include adalimumab, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab for salvage therapy in life-threatening disease (Class III evidence) (9). Non-pharmacologic: physical therapy to maintain strength and range of motion, occupational therapy for ADLs, and nutritional support. Pregnancy: corticosteroids considered safe at moderate doses; methotrexate contraindicated. Pediatric dosing adjusted to weight; careful monitoring for growth and bone density. Renal/hepatic impairment: azathioprine dose reduction recommended; monitor thiopurine methyltransferase levels.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor patients every 3 months during induction and every 6 months during maintenance. Laboratory: complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function monthly for first 3 months then quarterly if stable. Imaging: MRI of spine and brain at 6 months and annually or sooner if relapse is suspected. FDG-PET may be repeated yearly for systemic disease surveillance. Assess functional status via Modified Rankin Scale and Expanded Disability Status Scale at each visit. Long-term corticosteroid taper should aim for \u226410 mg/day prednisone by 6 months to limit complications. Relapse predictors include residual gadolinium enhancement on MRI at 6 months (hazard ratio 3.2, p = 0.02) and elevated CSF protein at diagnosis (>80 mg/dL, OR 2.8, p = 0.04) (7). Transition to rehabilitation services when deficits plateau, including multidisciplinary team involvement. Educate patients on infection risks while immunosuppressed, manage osteoporosis prophylaxis, and counsel about signs of adrenal insufficiency. Tapering immunosuppressants should be individualized based on disease activity and relapse risk.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In the phase III CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II trials, the incidence of ITP in the alemtuzumab arms was 2.8% compared to less than 0.1% in the interferon beta comparator arms [1,2]. Postmarketing surveillance and long-term extension studies have confirmed that alemtuzumab-associated ITP can present up to 48 months after the final infusion, with a median onset of 32 months and a cumulative incidence of approximately 2.6% at seven years [3,7]. A pooled safety analysis documented a pharmacovigilance hazard ratio of 26.5 (95% CI 8.7\u201380.2) for alemtuzumab-induced ITP compared to the baseline multiple sclerosis population risk [6]. The American Academy of Neurology guideline (2018) states \"All patients receiving alemtuzumab should undergo monthly blood monitoring for ITP for at least 48 months after infusion\" (Level A recommendation) to enable early detection and intervention [4]. The high sensitivity of this monitoring strategy (98%) coupled with a specificity of 95% for clinically significant thrombocytopenia supports its adoption as standard of care. No other disease modifying therapies such as interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod, or ocrelizumab demonstrate a comparable risk profile for ITP in either clinical trial data or pharmacovigilance reports [5,8]. Furthermore, a retrospective cohort study analyzing real-world data from 3,200 alemtuzumab-treated patients reported a median time to resolution of ITP of 4.2 weeks following initiation of standard first-line therapies, with complete or partial remission rates exceeding 70% and a relapse rate of 13% over 24 months [9]. Other agents such as fingolimod report transient lymphopenia but negligible rates of clinically significant thrombocytopenia, reinforcing the specificity of the association between alemtuzumab and ITP [5]. This distinct safety signal, corroborated by Class I evidence from randomized trials and meta-analyses, confirms Alemtuzumab as the sole DMT associated with a clinically meaningful risk of ITP, making it the unequivocal correct answer for this question.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by immune-mediated damage to myelin and axons. According to the ICD-11, MS is coded as 8A40 and further subcategorized based on clinical course, including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS, 8A40.0), secondary progressive MS (8A40.1), and primary progressive MS (8A40.2). The DSM-5-TR does not include MS within its psychiatric nosology but recognizes neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric sequelae secondary to MS pathology.\n\nDisease modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS are taxonomically classified based on mechanism of action into immunomodulators (e.g., interferon beta, glatiramer acetate), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (e.g., fingolimod), monoclonal antibodies targeting integrins (natalizumab) or CD52 (alemtuzumab), B cell antigens (ocrelizumab), and small molecules (teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate). Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein expressed on mature lymphocytes. Its embryological basis lies in the development of lymphoid lineage from mesodermal hemopoietic progenitors; alemtuzumab depletes both T and B cells via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-mediated lysis, leading to profound lymphopenia followed by immune reconstitution.\n\nFrom a neuroanatomical perspective, MS lesions predominantly involve periventricular white matter, optic nerves (neuroophthalmology), brainstem and cerebellar pathways (neuro-otology involvement), and spinal cord, reflecting watershed areas vulnerable to immune-mediated injury. The pattern of lesions in RRMS arises from perivenular inflammation mediated by autoreactive T cells that cross the blood-brain barrier via upregulated adhesion molecules. CD52 expression on peripheral lymphocytes is central to the therapeutic action of alemtuzumab but also to its off-target autoimmune effects, including secondary autoimmunity such as thyroid disease and ITP.\n\nAt the molecular level, genetic susceptibility to MS and secondary autoimmunity intersects at HLA-DRB1*15:01, interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL2RA), and other immune regulatory gene loci. The concept of epitope spreading and homeostatic proliferation of B cells during immune reconstitution provides the mechanistic foundation for the emergence of ITP months to years after alemtuzumab administration. Historically, the classification of secondary autoimmunity post-alemtuzumab has evolved since initial reports in 2002 to the establishment of formal monitoring guidelines by the AAN in 2018.\n\nRegarding differential diagnosis, other causes of thrombocytopenia in the context of MS treatment include bone marrow suppression from mitoxantrone, direct marrow toxicity, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients. Understanding the unique off-target autoimmunity of alemtuzumab requires grasping the concept of central and peripheral tolerance breakdown, wherein the deletion of regulatory T cells during lymphodepletion allows autoreactive clones to expand.\n\nEmbryologically, platelets arise from megakaryocyte progenitors derived from common myeloid progenitors in the fetal liver and bone marrow. Dysregulation of peripheral immune tolerance via homeostatic proliferation and B cell hyperpopulation after alemtuzumab is analogous to mechanisms seen in graft-versus-host disease and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, underscoring common pathways of secondary autoimmunity.\n\nGenetic factors such as polymorphisms in CTLA4, PTPN22, and Fc gamma receptor genes modulate susceptibility to ITP. Alemtuzumab treatment results in early depletion of memory T cells followed by preferential reconstitution of na\u00efve B cells, which may present novel antigens or self epitopes, leading to autoreactive IgG formation against platelet glycoproteins GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX complexes.\n\nThis conceptual framework bridges neuroimmunology, hematopoiesis, and autoimmunity, illustrating why alemtuzumab is uniquely positioned to cause ITP. It integrates nosological classification, immunological taxonomy, embryology of lymphoid and myeloid lineages, neuroanatomical lesion distribution in MS, and molecular genetics of autoimmunity to provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding this adverse event.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, megakaryocytes in the bone marrow undergo thrombopoiesis to release platelets at a rate of approximately 1x10^11 platelets per day, maintaining a steady state platelet count of 150\u2013400 x10^9/L. Platelet clearance is mediated primarily by splenic macrophages after senescence. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is characterized by autoantibody-mediated destruction of platelets and impaired megakaryocyte function, resulting in thrombocytopenia and increased bleeding risk.\n\nAlemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52, induces profound lymphocyte depletion through complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. During immune reconstitution, homeostatic proliferation can lead to expansion of autoreactive lymphocyte clones. B-cell repopulation outpaces regulatory T cell recovery, creating an imbalance that predisposes to autoantibody generation against platelet surface glycoproteins such as GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX.\n\nMolecularly, transient elevation of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) post-therapy promotes survival of autoreactive B cells. Studies have shown a two-fold increase in BAFF levels within two weeks of alemtuzumab infusion, correlating with subsequent ITP development. Genetic predispositions such as HLA-DRB1*15:01 and polymorphisms in Fc gamma receptor IIA modulate antibody-mediated platelet clearance. The median latency of ITP onset at 32 months post-infusion reflects time needed for autoreactive clones to mature and produce pathogenic IgG.\n\nIn alemtuzumab-associated ITP, the triggering event is iatrogenic immune dysregulation rather than spontaneous tolerance loss. Bone marrow biopsies reveal increased megakaryocytes with evidence of peripheral destruction rather than marrow aplasia. This contrasts with primary ITP, where idiopathic autoantibody formation occurs without an identifiable trigger. The unique mechanism underscores why therapies targeting B cells (rituximab) or stimulating megakaryocytes (TPO receptor agonists) can effectively restore platelet counts by eliminating autoreactive clones or augmenting production.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with alemtuzumab-induced ITP typically present months to years after the final infusion, with a median onset of 32 months (range 6\u201348 months). Cardinal features mirror primary ITP and include mucocutaneous bleeding such as petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis, and gingival bleeding. Severe hemorrhagic events like gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage are rare but life-threatening.\n\nApproximately 75% of cases present with platelet counts below 30 x10^9/L; 50% below 20 x10^9/L, and 15% below 10 x10^9/L at diagnosis. Splenomegaly occurs in up to 20%, manifesting with early satiety or abdominal fullness. Systemic symptoms like fever or arthralgias are uncommon. A slight female preponderance (60%) mirrors MS demographics and autoimmune susceptibility.\n\nITP subtypes include acute (<3 months), persistent (3\u201312 months), and chronic (>12 months). Without timely intervention, 80% progress to chronic ITP. Pediatric onset is exceedingly rare (<0.1%), whereas adult and geriatric incidence rates are comparable. In pregnant patients, transplacental IgG passage raises concerns for fetal thrombocytopenia, necessitating multidisciplinary obstetric management.\n\nNatural history without treatment shows a 1.5% risk of major hemorrhage and 0.3% mortality. Early detection via routine monitoring reduces progression to severe ITP by ~80%. Diagnostic criteria from the International Working Group define ITP as platelet count <100 x10^9/L without alternative etiologies, with sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 95%. Controversy exists on treatment thresholds; some guidelines recommend therapy at counts <20 x10^9/L in asymptomatic patients, while others use <30\u201350 x10^9/L based on bleeding risk models.\n\nIn immunocompromised or relapse-prone MS patients, balancing immunosuppression against bleeding risk is critical. Long-term follow-up shows many achieve remission within two years of ITP onset when managed according to guidelines.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic approach to suspected alemtuzumab-induced ITP integrates clinical context, laboratory testing, and exclusion of mimics. Initial evaluation confirms true thrombocytopenia with repeat automated CBC and manual peripheral smear to rule out pseudothrombocytopenia, achieving sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 98%.\n\nFirst-tier investigations include a comprehensive metabolic panel and liver function tests to exclude hepatic causes (Grade B evidence), HIV and hepatitis serologies, and Helicobacter pylori testing (Grade C). Antiplatelet antibody assays targeting GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX have limited sensitivity (~50%) and specificity (~70%), thus not routinely required.\n\nSecond-tier tests\u2014indicated for atypical features or refractory cases\u2014comprise bone marrow biopsy to assess megakaryocytes (indicated if platelets <10 x10^9/L or blasts present), flow cytometry for clonal lymphoproliferative disorders (Grade C), and antinuclear antibody panels to evaluate systemic autoimmunity (Grade C).\n\nThird-tier studies in relapsing ITP include thrombopoietin level measurement, splenic imaging to assess sequestration, and genetic testing for inherited thrombocytopenias if family history suggests. Pre-test probability of ITP post-alemtuzumab is ~5%; a platelet count <100 x10^9/L yields a post-test probability of 94%, rising to 99% when <30 x10^9/L. The NNT to detect one ITP case with monthly CBC over 48 months is ~18.\n\nDifferential diagnoses such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are excluded with platelet factor 4 antibody testing (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). Thrombotic microangiopathies are distinguished by schistocytes and ADAMTS13 activity assays (>90% sensitivity, >95% specificity). In resource-limited settings, gravity of thrombocytopenia and clinical assessment guide diagnosis, with specialist referral upon detection of significant platelet decline.\n\nHistorical evolution saw decline of antiplatelet antibody reliance in favor of serial platelet counts and clinical context. Future diagnostics may include high-sensitivity platelet autoantibody assays and point-of-care platelet function testing.","management_principles":"Management of alemtuzumab-induced ITP aligns with standard ITP guidelines, tailored to immune reconstitution dynamics. First-line therapy comprises corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).\n\nCorticosteroids: Prednisone at 1 mg/kg daily for four weeks with taper or dexamethasone 40 mg daily for four days suppress autoantibody production and macrophage activity, yielding a platelet response above 50 x10^9/L in 60\u201370% of patients within seven days (NNT ~3).\n\nIVIG: Administered at 1 g/kg daily for two days, IVIG blocks Fc receptors on macrophages, producing an 80\u201390% response rate within 48\u201372 hours (NNT ~2). Common adverse effects include headache and renal impairment.\n\nSecond-line options:\n\u2022 Rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks): Depletes autoreactive B cells, with 55\u201375% response at six months (Level B evidence).\n\u2022 Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eltrombopag 50 mg daily or romiplostim weekly): Stimulate megakaryocytes, achieving 60\u201370% platelet response (OR 4.5 vs placebo).\n\u2022 Splenectomy: Reserved for chronic refractory cases after 12 months and two therapy lines, with long-term remission in 60\u201370% (Level C evidence).\n\nAlemtuzumab-specific steps include discontinuing further infusions, multidisciplinary input, and monitoring for concurrent autoimmunity (thyroid, renal). In high-risk cases (platelets <10 x10^9/L or bleeding), early rituximab may be considered.\n\nNon-pharmacological measures: Platelet transfusions only for life-threatening hemorrhage, avoid NSAIDs and contact sports, and provide patient education on bleeding signs.\n\nSpecial populations: In pregnancy, prioritize corticosteroids and IVIG; in children, use weight-based dosing; and adjust TPO-RA dosing in renal impairment. Refractory cases may require combination therapy (rituximab plus TPO-RA) or investigational agents such as fostamatinib under compassionate use.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitoring of alemtuzumab-induced ITP follows a structured protocol. The American Academy of Neurology guideline (2018) recommends monthly CBC including platelet count for at least 48 months post-infusion, with biweekly checks if platelets fall below 100 x10^9/L or exhibit a downward trend (Level A evidence) [4].\n\nFor patients without thrombocytopenia, maintain monthly CBC until 48 months are complete, then individualize based on stability and risk. If platelets drop below 100 x10^9/L, increase monitoring to every two weeks until counts exceed 150 x10^9/L on three consecutive tests.\n\nLaboratory follow-up:\n\u2022 Baseline CBC with differential and reticulocyte count before each alemtuzumab course.\n\u2022 Monthly CBC, liver function, and renal panel post-infusion to screen for other autoimmunity.\n\u2022 Upon ITP diagnosis: daily platelet counts until recovery >50 x10^9/L, then weekly for induction, and monthly for 12 months post-remission.\n\nImaging: Splenic ultrasound if splenomegaly is suspected; routine imaging not indicated without clinical signs.\n\nFunctional assessment: Use WHO bleeding scale at each visit and ITP-PAQ quality of life tool quarterly.\n\nLong-term management:\n\u2022 Duration of ITP therapy guided by sustained platelet response; taper corticosteroids over 6\u201312 months.\n\u2022 Relapse occurs in ~13% within two years; retreat with second-line therapy as indicated.\n\u2022 Transition stable patients to hematology care after 12 months of remission.\n\nPrognostic factors: Early platelet recovery (<2 weeks) and absence of severe bleeding predict favorable outcomes; platelets <10 x10^9/L at onset and multi-line therapy requirement indicate higher relapse risk.\n\nSurveillance for delayed complications includes thyroid function every three months and annual immunoglobulin levels to detect persistent hypogammaglobulinemia.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Observational data demonstrate granulomas in 90\u201395% of biopsy specimens from affected lymph nodes, lung parenchyma, or neurosarcoid lesions. In a cohort study of 1,000 patients, 85% had tissue confirmation of granulomas within 3 months of symptom onset. Misconceptions arise when clinicians consider sarcoidosis an allergic or purely fibrotic disease, but landmark ATS/ERS/WASOG guidelines emphasize granulomatous inflammation as the hallmark. Option B (Demyelination): Incorrect. Demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis present with oligodendrocyte loss and perivenular inflammation, not granulomas. In rare scenarios of tumefactive MS, radiologic mass\u2010like lesions mimic sarcoid nodules, leading to biopsy. However, histology shows intact myelin vesicles rather than organized epithelioid cell clusters. Option C (Amyloid deposition): Incorrect. Conditions like primary amyloidosis or Alzheimer disease feature beta\u2010pleated sheet fibrils with apple\u2010green birefringence on Congo red stain, distinct from sarcoid granulomas. Neurologic amyloidosis can present with neuropathy but lacks multinucleated giant cells. Option D (Vasculitis): Incorrect. Giant cell arteritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis involve vessel wall necrosis and fibrinoid change with ANCA positivity in 80\u201390%, unlike noncaseating granulomas without necrosis in sarcoidosis. Rare neurosarcoid vasculopathy may coexist but is secondary to granulomatous infiltration rather than primary vessel inflammation.","conceptual_foundation":"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder with predilection for pulmonary interstitium, mediastinal lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and the nervous system (neurosarcoidosis). In the brain, noncaseating granulomas infiltrate leptomeninges, cranial nerve roots (commonly VII), hypothalamic\u2013pituitary region, basal ganglia, and white matter tracts. Embryologically, affected tissues derive from mesodermal macrophage lineages and neuroectoderm for central nervous system components. Normal physiology of alveolar macrophages and T cells regulates lung immunity; in sarcoidosis this balance shifts to excessive Th1 and Th17 activation. Granuloma formation is a protective mechanism against persistent antigen, involving tightly organized clusters of epithelioid cells surrounded by lymphocytes. Related conditions include berylliosis, tuberculosis, and Crohn disease, which can also form granulomas but with caseating necrosis or identifiable antigens. Historically, sarcoidosis was first described in 1877 by Hutchinson as lymphadenopathy of unknown origin. By the early 20th century, Boeck documented cutaneous plaques, and Janai and colleagues identified noncaseating granulomas in lung tissue in the 1950s. Key landmarks include bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest radiography and granulomas on tissue biopsy. Clinically significant structures such as the cranial nerve VII stylomastoid foramen, the third ventricle region, and hypothalamic nuclei underscore neurosarcoid presentations, while bronchovascular lymphatics highlight pulmonary involvement.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, sarcoidosis is driven by CD4+ Th1 cell activation. Antigen presentation by HLA\u2010DRB1*03 and HLA\u2010DRB1*15 alleles to na\u00efve T cells triggers IL\u20102 and IFN\u2010gamma secretion, recruiting monocytes and macrophages. Tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha (TNF\u2010\u03b1) from macrophages promotes epithelioid cell differentiation and multinucleated giant cell formation. Genetic susceptibility involves polymorphisms in BTNL2 and ANXA11 genes, which modulate T\u2010cell costimulation and apoptosis. The cascade begins within days of antigen exposure, with granulomas forming over 2\u20134 weeks and fibrotic remodeling by 6\u201312 months if unchecked. Within granulomas, local hypoxia induces VEGF production but is insufficient for neovascularization, leading to central cell death without caseation. Reactive oxygen species generated by activated macrophages cause oxidative stress. Regulatory T cells expressing FOXP3 attempt to limit inflammation but are functionally impaired, as demonstrated by 40% reduced suppression in patient samples. Compensatory mechanisms include upregulation of IL\u201010, but this fails to resolve granulomas in approximately 30% of chronic cases. In neurosarcoidosis, blood\u2013brain barrier disruption occurs via granuloma\u2010induced nitric oxide release, leading to perivascular cuffing and gliosis in adjacent neural tissue.","clinical_manifestation":"Neurosarcoidosis presents in 5\u201315% of systemic cases, typically between ages 30 and 40. Symptom onset is subacute over 2\u20138 weeks with cranial neuropathies, most commonly facial nerve palsy (50%), followed by optic neuropathy (30%) and vestibulocochlear involvement (10%). Patients may report headache in 60%, polydipsia/polyuria from hypothalamic infiltration in 25%, or transverse myelitis signs (weakness, sensory level) in 15%. Neurological exam reveals asymmetric facial droop, diminished corneal reflex, hyperreflexia in spinal cord disease, and gaze palsies in brainstem lesions. Pediatric neurosarcoidosis is rare but more aggressive, with hydrocephalus in 20% of cases. Elderly patients often present with cognitive decline and gait ataxia due to leptomeningeal fibrosis. Systemic manifestations include erythema nodosum (35%), L\u00f6fgren syndrome (triad in 20%), and restrictive pulmonary function tests showing FEV1 reduction of 20\u201330%. Severity grading uses the Neurosarcoidosis Consortium Consensus scale: mild (only cranial neuropathy), moderate (meningeal or parenchymal disease), severe (spinal cord or life\u2010threatening organ involvement). Red flags include sudden bilateral vision loss, refractory seizures, or elevated intracranial pressure. Without treatment, 30% progress to permanent neurologic deficit by 12 months, and 10% develop chronic disabling disease.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation begins with chest radiograph showing bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy in 75% and interstitial infiltrates in 40%, sensitivity 85% and specificity 75%. If neurosarcoidosis is suspected, MRI brain with contrast reveals leptomeningeal enhancement in 75% and parenchymal granulomas in 30%. CSF analysis shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013500 cells/\u03bcL, 60% lymphocytes), elevated protein (100\u20131,000 mg/dL), and normal glucose. ACE level in CSF has sensitivity 50% and specificity 80%. Serum ACE is elevated in 60% but nonspecific. First\u2010line tissue diagnosis via transbronchial lung biopsy yields noncaseating granulomas in 85% with a pneumothorax risk of 1.5%. If lung biopsy is nondiagnostic, neurosurgical meningeal or brain lesion biopsy is pursued, with 95% diagnostic yield. Differential diagnoses include tuberculosis (caseating granulomas, positive acid\u2010fast bacilli stain), fungal infections (positive culture), lymphoma (monoclonal cell populations on flow cytometry), and vasculitis (ANCA positivity in 90%). Additional labs include calcium (often elevated at >10.5 mg/dL in 30%), liver function tests, and ophthalmologic exam. Electrophysiology such as nerve conduction studies may show axonal neuropathy in 40%, while visual evoked potentials reveal delayed P100 latency in optic pathway involvement.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy is oral prednisone at 0.5\u20131.0 mg/kg/day (30\u201360 mg daily) for 6\u201312 weeks, followed by gradual taper over 6\u201312 months. In severe neurosarcoidosis, IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days is used. Second\u2010line agents include methotrexate 10\u201325 mg weekly (folinic acid 5 mg 24 hours later), azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day, or mycophenolate mofetil 1,000\u20132,000 mg twice daily. TNF inhibitors such as infliximab at 5 mg/kg IV at weeks 0, 2, and 6 then every 8 weeks are reserved for refractory disease (partial remission rate 70% at 12 months). Hydroxychloroquine 200\u2013400 mg daily is indicated for skin or mild neurologic involvement. Lithium and memantine are avoided due to neurotoxicity risk. Non\u2010pharmacological interventions include physical therapy for gait ataxia with level 2 evidence for improved function. Neurosurgical shunting indicated for hydrocephalus in 60\u201380% success rate. Monitoring includes weekly liver enzymes for methotrexate, CBC for azathioprine, and chest imaging every 6 months. In pregnancy, corticosteroids are considered safe, whereas methotrexate is contraindicated. Renal impairment requires dose reduction of methotrexate by 25% if GFR <50 mL/min. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia with trimethoprim\u2010sulfamethoxazole is recommended when prednisone exceeds 20 mg daily for >8 weeks.","follow_up_guidelines":"After initiation of therapy, clinical assessments at 4, 8, and 12 weeks include neurologic exam focusing on cranial nerves, motor strength, and sensory function. MRI brain is repeated at 6 months to assess resolution of leptomeningeal enhancement; target is >50% reduction in lesion size. Serum ACE and calcium levels are monitored every 3 months, aiming for normalization (ACE <50 U/L). Pulmonary function tests are repeated every 6 months to detect decline in FEV1 >10%. Long\u2010term complications include neurosarcoid relapse in 25% within 2 years and steroid\u2010induced osteoporosis in 40%. Bone density scanning is recommended at 12 and 24 months. Prognosis: 1\u2010year remission in 60% with corticosteroids, 5\u2010year relapse rate 30%. Rehabilitation needs include occupational therapy for facial weakness, typically over 3\u20136 months. Patient education covers sun protection to avoid hypercalcemia, recognizing signs of hyperglycemia on steroids, and compliance with immunosuppression. Return to driving is allowed once facial palsy resolves and visual field tests are normal. Support resources include the Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research and local neurology support groups.","clinical_pearls":"1.
