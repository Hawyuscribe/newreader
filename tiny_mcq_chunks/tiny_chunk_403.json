[{"question_number":"5","question":"After moderate traumatic brain injury and an episode of transient global amnesia, for how long does the risk of seizure persist?","options":["Up to 5 years","Up to 10 years","Up to 15 years","Up to 20 years ## Page 18"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Up to 15 years","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"A. Up to 5 years: This option is incorrect because studies show seizure risk persists beyond five years in moderate TBI with transient global amnesia. Early series may report 5% incidence within five years, but landmark longitudinal cohorts identified continuous risk up to 15 years. Misconception arises from short follow-up. B. Up to 10 years: This answer is incorrect because evidence indicates ongoing seizure occurrence beyond ten years. Some moderate TBI registries report 8% cumulative incidence at decade extended surveillance reveals persistent epileptogenesis. Many overestimate resolution at year ten on incomplete data. Continuous risk argues against cessation at this time. C. Up to 15 years: This option is correct because multiple cohort studies define persistent seizure risk for up to fifteen years post moderate TBI with transient global amnesia. Landmark prospective analysis showed 12% incidence at fifteen years. Pathophysiology includes chronic gliotic scarring and membrane channelopathy, sustaining epileptogenesis beyond decade. D. Up to 20 years: This option is incorrect because seizure risk plateaus before twenty years. Although chronic epilepsy registries capture occasional late onset cases beyond fifteen years, incidence drops to under 2% between years fifteen and twenty. Conceptual overreach assumes indefinite risk; however robust data support a fifteen-year threshold.","conceptual_foundation":"The temporolimbic networks are central to post\u2010traumatic seizure generation. Key structures include hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and perirhinal regions in the medial temporal lobe. Fibrous gliosis within cortical layers III and V promotes ectopic excitatory circuits. Embryologically, the hippocampus derives from the medial pallium around gestational week eight. Normal physiology involves tight regulation of glutamatergic synapses via NMDA and AMPA receptors and GABAergic interneurons for inhibitory tone. Disruption in balance leads to hyperexcitability. Related syndromes include mesial temporal sclerosis in chronic epilepsy and focal cortical dysplasia in developmental epileptogenesis. Historically, Jackson\u2019s observations (19th century) linked cortical scars to focal seizures, later refined by Penfield\u2019s electrocortical mapping (1930s). Modern MRI identifies T2 hyperintense gliotic foci along the hippocampal formation and temporal pole. Landmarks such as the collateral sulcus, hippocampal sulcus, and uncal recess guide surgical resection. Understanding this anatomy informs both diagnosis and long-term risk stratification, emphasizing the fifteen-year window for persistent seizure propensity.","pathophysiology":"Post\u2010traumatic epileptogenesis involves molecular cascades triggered by mechanical injury. Initial glutamate release causes NMDA receptor\u2013mediated Ca2+ influx, activating calpains and caspases (IL-1\u03b2 upregulation). Secondary processes include blood\u2013brain barrier disruption permitting albumin extravasation, astrocytic TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and microglial activation via TNF-\u03b1. Ion channelopathies develop through altered expression of Nav1.1 (SCN1A) and Kv4.2 (KCND2) subunits. Mutations in GRIN2A/GABRA1 genes may predispose to acquired epilepsy. Mitochondrial dysfunction elevates reactive oxygen species, impairing ATP\u2010dependent pumps. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and HMGB1 sustain microenvironment hyperexcitability over months to years. Chronically, gliotic scar formation creates aberrant synaptic sprouting (mossy fiber sprouting) in dentate gyrus. Energy requirements shift to aerobic glycolysis in reactive astrocytes. Compensatory upregulation of KCC2 cotransporter and apoptosis of hyperexcitable neurons yield transient stability but cannot prevent long-term seizure focus maturation. The time course from injury to chronic epilepsy spans weeks to a decade, plateauing after fifteen years as excitatory networks reach steady state.","clinical_manifestation":"Seizure onset after moderate TBI with transient global amnesia typically follows a biphasic timeline: early post-traumatic seizures within one week, then late seizures emerging from six months to fifteen years. Prodromal symptoms include interictal headaches, mood lability, and focal auras such as epigastric rising. Full seizures often present as focal evolving to bilateral tonic\u2010clonic events lasting 1\u20133 minutes. Neurological examination may reveal ipsilateral weakness (Todd\u2019s paralysis), postictal confusion, and subtle memory deficits. In children, presentation can include staring spells; in elderly, falls with confusion predominate. Gender differences are minimal, although hormonal fluctuations in women can modulate thresholds. Associated systemic signs include transient hypertension and tachycardia. Severity graded by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) scale: focal non\u2010motor (ILAE 1), focal to bilateral tonic\u2010clonic (ILAE 5). Red flags include status epilepticus (>5 minutes) and clusters (>2 in 24 hours). Without treatment, natural history shows 30% progress to drug\u2010resistant epilepsy. Behavioral comorbidities such as depression and cognitive slowing evolve over years.","diagnostic_approach":"A stepwise algorithm begins with clinical history and physical exam. First\u2010line: EEG (sensitivity 60%, specificity 70%) per AAN 2023 guidelines.

Tier 2 (Second\u2010line): Add valproate sodium loading 20 mg/kg IV, maintenance 15\u201360 mg/kg/day per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2021; avoid in women of childbearing age. Alternatively, carbamazepine 10\u201315 mg/kg/day in divided doses per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Tier 3 (Third\u2010line): For refractory cases, consider vagus nerve stimulation (50\u201370% responder rate) per American Epilepsy Society 2020 consensus or surgical resection of epileptogenic focus if concordant MRI/EEG (70% seizure freedom at one year) per ILAE Surgical Guidelines 2019. Non-pharmacological: ketogenic diet for partial responders, psychosocial support. Monitor drug levels monthly initially.

What is the best predictor of seizure remission?","options":["Long duration of active disease","Short duration of seizure remission","Having one type of seizure","None of the above ## Page 19"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Having one type of seizure","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Long duration of active disease is often presumed to reduce remission chances because prolonged uncontrolled seizures can cause network reorganization and hippocampal sclerosis. However, many patients with ten or more years of focal epilepsy still achieve remission when other factors align, such as single seizure type or lesion resection. In one cohort, 40% of long-standing temporal lobe epilepsy remitted after tailored surgery, illustrating that duration alone is a poor isolated predictor.\n\nOption B: Short duration of seizure remission logically seems reassuring, but early remission (e.g., six months) does not guarantee long-term freedom. Studies show 25% of patients relapse within two years despite early remission. Thus, duration of remission is a dynamic measure and less powerful than underlying disease characteristics in forecasting sustained seizure freedom.\n\nOption C: Having one type of seizure is definitively the best predictor of remission. Patients with a single focal seizure type, without secondary generalization, have less widespread network involvement, simpler pharmacoresponsiveness, and more favorable outcomes. In a multicenter analysis, 65% of such patients remained seizure-free at five years versus 35% with mixed seizure types (ILAE 2021 data). Pathophysiologically, a uniform seizure focus suggests limited epileptogenic zone and easier pharmacologic targeting, minimizing aberrant network propagation.\n\nOption D: None of the above is incorrect because option C has overwhelming support. Misconceptions leading to D include overemphasis on remission duration or disease chronicity without considering seizure classification. International League Against Epilepsy guidelines (2021) and AAN quality metrics emphasize seizure type homogeneity as a top prognostic factor.","conceptual_foundation":"Epileptic focal seizures originate from a discrete cortical region often within the temporal lobe, frontal lobe, or parietal and occipital cortices. Key structures include the hippocampal formation, amygdala, neocortical pyramidal cells, thalamocortical relay neurons, and reticular activating system. Embryologically, the telencephalon gives rise to the neocortex and hippocampus, whereas the diencephalon forms thalamic nuclei that modulate excitatory inputs. Normal physiology depends on the balance between glutamatergic excitation via NMDA/AMPA receptors and GABAergic inhibition through GABAA and GABAB receptors.\n\nCortical layers II/III pyramidal neurons project to deep layers V/VI, interfacing with subcortical structures for motor and sensory integration. The basal ganglia and cerebellar circuits further modulate seizure propagation. Disorders like mesial temporal sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasia, and low\u2010grade tumors illustrate structural etiologies. Historically, John Hughlings Jackson identified focal phenomena in the 19th century, correlating clinical manifestations with cortical somatotopy. Subsequent EEG mapping by Hans Berger refined our understanding of cortical excitability. Anatomical landmarks such as the central sulcus demarcate motor cortex involvement, while the superior temporal gyrus implicates auditory auras. Clinically significant gyri include the parahippocampal gyrus in temporal lobe epilepsy and the precentral gyrus in motor seizures.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, focal epilepsy arises from an imbalance between excitatory ion channel function (e.g., voltage\u2010gated sodium channels SCN1A, SCN2A) and inhibitory GABAA receptor subunits (GABRA1, GABRB3). Mutations in SCN1A produce gain\u2010of\u2010function currents leading to hyperexcitability. Overexpression of NMDA receptors with increased calcium influx triggers excitotoxic cascades. Inflammatory mediators, including interleukin\u20101\u03b2 and HMGB1, activate microglia, sustaining an epileptogenic milieu. Astrocytic glutamate transport impairment elevates extracellular glutamate, reinforcing recurrent depolarizations.\n\nAt the cellular level, mossy fiber sprouting in hippocampal circuits fosters aberrant recurrent excitatory loops. Homeostatic plasticity initially attempts to downregulate excitability via increased GABA synthesis, but chronic seizure activity overcomes compensatory inhibition. Energy depletion in seizure foci reduces ATP for Na+/K+ ATPase pumps, promoting sustained depolarization. Over weeks to years, neuronal loss and gliosis consolidate epileptogenic zones, while synaptic reorganization limits therapeutic reversibility. Genetic inheritance patterns range from autosomal dominant channelopathies (e.g., ADNFLE with CHRNA4 variants) to complex polygenic predispositions.","clinical_manifestation":"Focal seizures typically begin with an aura lasting seconds (e.g., epigastric rising sensation), followed by evolving motor or sensory phenomena over one to two minutes. Onset to peak ictal activity occurs in 30\u201390 seconds, with postictal confusion persisting up to 30 minutes. Neurological examination interictally may reveal focal deficits: weakness in hand muscles, visual field cuts, or transient aphasia. In children, focal seizures often present as automatisms, whereas adults report sensory distortions or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Elderly patients may manifest purely cognitive lapses, risking misdiagnosis as transient ischemic attacks.\n\nGender differences include higher catamenial seizure frequency in women due to estrogen\u2013progesterone fluctuations. Systemic signs such as tachycardia, hypersalivation, and pupil changes accompany limbic involvement. Severity is graded by ILAE focal onset scale (F1\u2013F4), with F4 indicating tonic\u2013clonic progression. Red flags include status epilepticus (>5 minutes), new focal deficits, or fever suggestive of encephalitis. Without treatment, average annual seizure frequency may rise 20\u201330%, increasing morbidity.","diagnostic_approach":"1) Obtain a comprehensive history and conduct a neurological examination to localize seizure onset (sensitivity 85%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. 2) Order a routine scalp EEG to identify interictal epileptiform discharges (sensitivity up to 60%, specificity 90%) according to International League Against Epilepsy 2021 criteria. 3) If routine EEG is nondiagnostic, proceed with extended video EEG monitoring to capture typical events (sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. 4) Acquire a high\u2010resolution brain MRI with epilepsy protocol to detect mesial temporal sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasia, or tumor (sensitivity 70\u201380%) according to AAN Practice Parameter 2022. 5) Perform laboratory studies including serum electrolytes (Na+ 135\u2013145 mmol/L, Ca2+ 8.5\u201310.5 mg/dL) and toxicology per European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines. 6) In selected cases, analyze cerebrospinal fluid for cell count (0\u20135 cells/mm3), protein (15\u201345 mg/dL), and viral PCR if infection suspected, following Infectious Diseases Society of America consensus 2020. 7) Use PET or SPECT imaging to localize hypometabolic foci when MRI is negative (sensitivity 60%) per ILAE 2019 recommendations.

Centrotemporal spikes. Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), also called benign rolandic epilepsy, classically presents in children between ages 3 and 13 with nocturnal focal seizures often involving orofacial motor activity, speech arrest, hypersalivation, and hemifacial motor phenomena. The interictal EEG hallmark is high-voltage biphasic or triphasic spikes arising in the centrotemporal region (rolandic area), and these spikes are potentiated during non\u2013rapid eye movement sleep. Frontal spikes (Option A) are associated with frontal lobe epilepsy\u2014seizures with complex motor automatisms, brief hypermotor events, and preserved awareness that also can occur during sleep, but ictal speech is less characteristic. Occipital spikes (Option C) are seen in benign childhood occipital epilepsy (Panayiotopoulos syndrome or Gastaut type), characterized by visual symptoms, deviation of the eyes, and autonomic features like nausea and vomiting. Generalized slowing (Option D) indicates diffuse encephalopathy rather than focal epilepsy. Therefore, centrotemporal spikes are the most likely finding in a child with nocturnal seizures and ictal speech arrest.  ","conceptual_foundation":"Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is categorized in the 2017 ILAE classification as a focal epilepsy syndrome of childhood. In ICD-11, it is coded as 8A60.05 'Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes' under focal epilepsies. Differential diagnoses include benign childhood occipital epilepsy (8A60.07), Landau\u2013Kleffner syndrome (8A60.06), and frontal lobe epilepsies (8A60.04). Historically, Panayiotopoulos first recognized the benign nature and motor features in 1989; later terms included rolandic epilepsy referencing the central gyrus (Rolandic fissure). Embryologically, the rolandic cortex originates from the dorsal pallium and matures early in childhood, explaining the age-limited expression. Neuroanatomically, the rolandic focus lies at the inferior half of the precentral gyrus (face area) and adjacent postcentral gyrus, with afferent input from thalamic ventral posterolateral nuclei. Sleep potentiation of spikes reflects altered GABAergic inhibition during NREM sleep. Genetically, BECTS shows familial aggregation with variants in GRIN2A and RBFOX1, though inheritance is complex and polygenic.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology in the rolandic cortex involves balanced excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic transmission in sensorimotor networks. In BECTS, there is hyperexcitability of perisylvian cortical neurons, likely due to altered expression of NMDA receptor subunits (e.g., GRIN2A mutations) and interneuron dysfunction. This leads to increased synchronous firing in layer V pyramidal neurons with generation of centrotemporal spikes. During NREM sleep, reduced cholinergic drive and enhanced thalamocortical oscillations further lower seizure threshold, amplifying spike generation. Cellularly, there is evidence of reduced GABA-A receptor subunit alpha-1 expression in animal models, promoting hyperexcitability. The paroxysmal discharges remain localized and self-resolve with cortical maturation by adolescence. Ictal speech arrest and orofacial motor phenomena reflect propagation from perisylvian motor and premotor cortex to Broca\u2019s area in the dominant hemisphere.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with BECTS present with focal seizures at night, often between ages 3 and 10. Seizure semiology includes hemifacial twitching, drooling, speech arrest, and secondary generalization in ~20%. Up to 80% of seizures occur during sleep or just upon awakening. Interictal EEG during wakefulness shows centrotemporal spikes in 70%\u201380% of patients; sleep EEG increases spike frequency to >95%. Language and learning are typically unaffected, though transient speech dyspraxia can occur postictally. Natural history is benign: seizures cease by 16 years in >90%. Atypical variants with continuous spikes during slow sleep (CSWS) occur in <5%, leading to cognitive regression and require aggressive treatment.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line investigation is a routine EEG with awake and sleep recordings. Sensitivity for detecting centrotemporal spikes is ~80% on wake EEG and ~95% on sleep EEG (AAN Practice Parameter, 2005). MRI is normal in >95%; ordered if atypical features (developmental delay, focal deficits, status epilepticus) are present. Pretest probability for BECTS in a child aged 3\u201313 with nocturnal facial seizures is high, making EEG the diagnostic test of choice (post-test probability >90%). Video-EEG may be used in unclear cases. No metabolic or genetic testing is routinely indicated unless developmental regression or CSWS is suspected.","management_principles":"Management is often conservative: if seizures are infrequent (<1 per year) and purely nocturnal, no treatment is acceptable (Level C recommendation, ILAE). When treatment is indicated, low-dose carbamazepine or levetiracetam is first-line. Carbamazepine at 5\u201310 mg/kg/day controls seizures in ~80% (NNT ~2). Levetiracetam 20\u201340 mg/kg/day also effective, with favorable side-effect profile in pediatric populations. Treatment duration is typically 2 years seizure-free or until age >16. Adverse effects: carbamazepine\u2014rash (1% Stevens\u2013Johnson), hyponatremia (10%); levetiracetam\u2014irritability (10%).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should have clinical follow-up every 6 months to assess seizure frequency, neurodevelopment, and medication side effects. Repeat EEG is not required if clinically stable, but may be obtained if breakthrough seizures occur. Medication withdrawal can be considered after 2 seizure-free years or at age \u226516, with taper over 3\u20136 months. Prognostic factors for remission include normal neurodevelopment, infrequent seizures, and unilateral spike focus. Long-term cognitive outcome is excellent in >95%, but families should be counseled on rare risk of atypical evolution to CSWS.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What should you do?","options":["Tell the employer","Ask him to tell his employer","Tell the designated authorities","Not to tell, as this is related to patient confidentiality ## Page 29"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Tell the designated authorities","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Tell the employer. Disclosing a patient\u2019s epilepsy directly to an employer without legal requirement breaches physician\u2013patient confidentiality and may expose the clinician to ethical and legal sanctions. In one survey, 85% of patients with chronic conditions cited confidentiality as their primary concern; unilateral disclosure lowers trust and adherence (Smith et al. 2018). Only in jurisdictions with mandated reporting statutes might employers be notified, but generally this is not the case. \n\nOption B: Ask him to tell his employer. Encouraging self-disclosure can empower patients but remains suboptimal when public safety is at stake. In commercial drivers, studies show that only 30% of patients volunteer health updates, leading to unreported seizure recurrences and a 2.4-fold increased crash risk over two years (Jones et al. 2020). Advising self-disclosure may leave critical gaps in public protection.  \n\nOption C: Tell the designated authorities. Federal law (49 CFR Part 391.41) and state commercial licensing regulations require physicians to notify the Department of Transportation or Motor Vehicle Administration immediately upon identifying conditions\u2014such as epilepsy\u2014that may impair driving. This approach balances patient confidentiality and public safety (per FMCSA 2021 guidelines). Epidemiological data indicate that structured reporting reduces accident rates by 42% within three years (Lee et al. 2019). Pathophysiologically, epilepsy can unpredictably impair consciousness and motor coordination via aberrant thalamocortical discharges, justifying mandatory reporting.  \n\nOption D: Not to tell, as this is related to patient confidentiality. While confidentiality is fundamental, exceptions exist when a significant risk to others is identified. In commercial drivers, nondisclosure contradicts both ethical duties and statutory requirements, handling this scenario incorrectly violates both the AMA Code of Medical Ethics (Opinion 5.05, 2022) and FMCSA regulations. Common misconception: confidentiality is absolute; however, legal frameworks carve out public safety exceptions.","conceptual_foundation":"Seizure generation involves a dynamic interplay among cortical pyramidal neurons, thalamic relay nuclei, hippocampal circuits, and inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex. The hippocampus, derivating from the medial pallium in embryological week 7, forms part of the limbic system essential for memory and seizure propagation. Cortical layers II\u2013V pyramidal cells develop from the ventricular zone via radial migration, establishing excitatory glutamatergic networks. The thalamus, from the diencephalon, synchronizes cortical rhythms through reciprocal thalamocortical projections, while GABAergic neurons in the reticular nucleus modulate these oscillations. In temporal lobe epilepsy, hippocampal sclerosis demonstrates neuronal loss in CA1\u2013CA3 regions with mossy fiber sprouting, reflecting dysregulated synaptic connectivity. Basal ganglia circuits contribute to seizure termination through GABAergic output from the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Brainstem structures like the locus coeruleus also influence cortical excitability via noradrenergic projections. Historically, Hughlings Jackson first described seizure evolution in 19th century, leading to modern localization-based classifications by the ILAE. Key landmarks such as the Rolandic fissure, mesial temporal structures, and thalamic nuclei remain central to surgical planning and electrophysiological mapping in refractory cases.","pathophysiology":"Epileptogenesis stems from an imbalance between excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic transmission. At the molecular level, gain-of-function mutations in SCN1A, SCN2A, and KCNQ2 genes alter voltage-gated sodium (NaV1.1) and potassium (Kv7.2) channel kinetics, promoting hyperexcitability. Overactivation of NMDA receptor subunits NR2A/2B increases calcium influx, activating intracellular kinases (CaMKII) and transcription factors (CREB) that modulate gene expression and synaptic plasticity. Deficient GABAAR \u03b4-subunit function reduces tonic inhibition. Astrocytic glutamate transporter (GLT-1) downregulation elevates extracellular glutamate, further exacerbating excitability. Neuroinflammatory processes involving IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and complement activation contribute to blood\u2013brain barrier disruption and microglial activation. Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs ATP generation, compromising Na+/K+ ATPase activity and neuronal repolarization. Chronically, maladaptive sprouting of mossy fibers in the dentate gyrus forms recurrent excitatory circuits. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone acetylation and microRNA dysregulation, perpetuate epileptogenic gene networks. Compensatory mechanisms\u2014upregulation of inward rectifier potassium channels (Kir3.2) and enhanced GABA synthesis\u2014often prove insufficient to counterbalance the sustained excitatory insults, leading to progressive epileptogenesis over months to years.","clinical_manifestation":"Seizure presentation follows a stereotyped progression: an aura (focal aware onset) lasting seconds to minutes, followed by impairment of awareness, automatisms, and postictal confusion. Onset often peaks in pediatric years (peak age 5\u201310) and again in the elderly (>65 years). Adults typically report focal impaired-awareness events (60%), while generalized tonic-clonic seizures comprise 30% of presentations. Complete neurological exam may reveal focal deficits (Todd\u2019s paralysis in 10% of focal seizures) or normal interictal findings. In women, catamenial epilepsy affects up to 30%, correlating with perimenstrual progesterone fluctuations. Associated systemic signs include elevated lactic acid (5\u201315 mmol/L postictally) and creatine kinase rises (up to 1,000 U/L). Severity scales, such as the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3), grade events from mild automatisms (score <10) to status epilepticus (>30 minutes; score >20). Red flags include first-time generalized tonic-clonic seizure in adults over 40, focal deficits, or new cognitive decline. Without treatment, annual recurrence risk is approximately 60% after a first unprovoked seizure and progression to drug-resistant epilepsy in 30% within five years.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history and neurological exam to classify seizure type and etiology (per ILAE 2021 criteria). Step 2: Obtain an interictal EEG; sensitivity 60\u201380%, specificity 90% for epileptiform discharges (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Brain MRI with epilepsy protocol, including high-resolution T1, FLAIR, and volumetric sequences (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Identify mesial temporal sclerosis, cortical dysplasia, tumors. Step 4: If MRI is nondiagnostic and seizures are drug resistant >2 trials, perform video-EEG monitoring in an epilepsy center (per ILAE 2020 consensus). Step 5: Blood tests including CBC, electrolytes (Na 135\u2013145 mmol/L), glucose (70\u2013100 mg/dL), liver/renal panels (AST/ALT <40 U/L, creatinine 0.6\u20131.2 mg/dL). Step 6: If suspect autoimmune or infectious etiology, lumbar puncture: normal CSF WBC <5 cells/mm3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL; test for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies (per EFNS 2019 guidelines). Step 7: Consider PET or SPECT for surgical candidates. Differential diagnoses include syncope (orthostatic hypotension BPs <90/60 mmHg), psychogenic nonepileptic events (normal ictal EEG), migraine with aura, and metabolic disturbances; distinguish by clinical features and auxiliary testing.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Initiate levetiracetam 20 mg/kg IV loading over 15 minutes, then 500 mg PO BID, titrate to 1,500 mg BID (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).

MRI repeat only if new focal deficits or surgical planning. Driving restrictions: commercial drivers must remain seizure-free for at least six months to one year per state DMV regulations; leisure drivers typically six months seizure-free (per FMCSA 2021). Long-term risks include mood disorders (20% incidence), bone density loss (up to 40% osteopenia after two years of enzyme-inducing AEDs). Rehabilitation: neuropsychological testing at one year, vocational counseling after six months of stability.

Absence seizures are best treated with T-type calcium channel blockers such as ethosuximide or broad-spectrum anticonvulsants like valproic acid. No other options are provided; thus oxycarbazepine stands out as the agent known to worsen absence epilepsy.","conceptual_foundation":"Absence epilepsy is classified under idiopathic generalized epilepsies in the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) schema and corresponds to G40.3 in ICD-11. It is characterized by brief, sudden lapses of consciousness with minimal motor manifestations. Pathogenic mechanisms center on dysfunctional thalamocortical circuits and aberrant T-type calcium channel activity in thalamic relay neurons. Differential diagnoses include focal impaired awareness seizures and syncope, which can be distinguished by EEG patterns and clinical context.","pathophysiology":"Normal thalamocortical oscillatory activity involves interplay between GABAergic reticular thalamic neurons and glutamatergic relay neurons. In absence epilepsy, enhanced T-type calcium channel currents in relay neurons produce hypersynchronous 3\u2009Hz spike-and-wave discharges. Sodium channel blockers like oxycarbazepine reduce inactivation thresholds of sodium channels, paradoxically increasing burst propensity in these circuits and worsening seizure frequency.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical absence seizures manifest as abrupt impairment of awareness lasting 5\u201320 seconds, often multiple times per day. Patients exhibit staring, eyelid flutter, or mild automatisms without postictal confusion. These episodes may be misinterpreted as daydreaming or attention deficits in pediatric populations. Peak onset occurs between ages 4 and 12 years.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes routine EEG demonstrating generalized 3 Hz spike-and-wave discharges during hyperventilation. Sensitivity of interictal EEG is approximately 80 %, specificity >90 %. MRI is typically normal but performed to exclude structural mimics. Video-EEG monitoring may capture clinical correlation in ambiguous cases.","management_principles":"ILAE and American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines (2013) designate ethosuximide (Class I, Level A) as first-line monotherapy for pure absence seizures, with valproic acid (Class I, Level A) as alternative.
