The most appropriate immediate action in the absence of airway compromise is to administer an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. Stopping the tPA infusion (Option A) is reserved for severe, progressing angioedema or airway compromise; routine discontinuation is not required for mild swelling and would reduce the likelihood of reperfusion benefit. Immediate intubation (Option C) is indicated only if there are signs of upper airway obstruction (stridor, hypoxemia, inability to swallow), which are not described. Obtaining a CT brain (Option D) is unnecessary for management of angioedema and would delay treatment. Thus, Option B is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Alteplase (tPA) is a serine protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin, promoting fibrinolysis to restore cerebral perfusion in acute ischemic stroke. tPA-induced angioedema is a known adverse effect occurring in approximately 0.2\u20135% of treated patients. Risk factors include concurrent ACE inhibitor therapy (due to reduced bradykinin breakdown), stroke location in the insula or frontal operculum (autonomic imbalance), and female sex. Clinically, it manifests within minutes to an hour of infusion initiation as unilateral or bilateral swelling of the lips, tongue, or perioral area. Understanding the balance between maximizing reperfusion and managing complications underlies stroke care protocols endorsed by the AHA/ASA (2018 guidelines).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, bradykinin is rapidly degraded by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and other kininases. tPA increases plasmin generation, which in turn activates the kallikrein-kinin system, raising bradykinin levels and leading to increased vascular permeability in submucosal tissues. In patients on ACE inhibitors, bradykinin degradation is further impaired, substantially elevating the risk of angioedema. The resultant capillary leakage presents as soft-tissue swelling of the lips, tongue, and oropharynx. If unchecked, airway compromise can ensue. This mechanism is distinct from IgE-mediated allergic reactions, being primarily bradykinin-driven.","clinical_manifestation":"tPA-induced angioedema typically presents within 30\u201390 minutes of infusion start with: \u2022 Perioral or lingual swelling (100% of cases) \u2022 Dysphagia or drooling (15\u201330%) \u2022 Hoarseness or muffled voice (10\u201320%) \u2022 Stridor or respiratory distress (<5%) Unilateral tongue swelling contralateral to the infarct is a classic but not universal presentation. Without intervention, mild cases often resolve within hours; severe cases may progress rapidly, risking airway obstruction. Awareness of this complication is critical given the need to balance continued reperfusion therapy against emergent airway management.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on the temporal relationship to tPA infusion, characteristic distribution of swelling, and exclusion of alternative causes (e.g., allergic drug reaction, stroke progression). No imaging or laboratory tests are required. Bedside assessment should focus on airway patency, oxygen saturation, and progression rate. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy may be considered in equivocal cases to assess laryngeal edema but is not routinely needed.","management_principles":"For mild to moderate angioedema without airway compromise: 1. Administer H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 25\u201350 mg IV) and H2 blocker (famotidine 20 mg IV). 2. Administer corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 125 mg IV) to reduce inflammation. 3. Observe closely for progression. 4. Continue tPA infusion unless swelling worsens. For severe angioedema or any sign of airway compromise: 1. Discontinue tPA infusion. 2. Administer epinephrine 0.3\u20130.5 mg IM. 3. Prepare for airway intervention (intubation or cricothyrotomy). These recommendations align with AHA/ASA stroke guidelines (Hemphill et al., 2018).","follow_up_guidelines":"After resolution, the patient should be monitored in a stroke unit for at least 6\u201312 hours for recurrence of swelling. Avoid ACE inhibitors in the future. Document the adverse reaction prominently in the medical record. Educate the patient on recognizing early angioedema signs. No routine imaging or lab follow-up is required for angioedema alone.","clinical_pearls":"1. tPA angioedema often occurs contralateral to the stroke due to insular cortex autonomic imbalance \u2013 high-yield for stroke localization. 2.

What is the mechanism of this lesion (Subdural hematoma)?","options":["Bridging veins rupture","Middle meningeal artery rupture"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Bridging veins rupture","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (bridging veins rupture) accurately explains the slow development of a subdural hematoma in an elderly patient. Bridging veins span the subdural space and are particularly vulnerable to shearing forces when cortical atrophy increases the distance between brain surface and dura. Minor trauma or even spontaneous stress can tear these veins, leading to venous bleeding that accumulates gradually and presents weeks later with confusion and focal deficits. Radiographically, subdural hematomas appear crescent-shaped, may cross suture lines, and do not cross the midline due to the falx cerebri. Option B (middle meningeal artery rupture) characterizes an epidural hematoma: arterial bleeding between dura and skull, typically linked to a temporal bone fracture, acute presentation with a lucid interval, lens-shaped collection that does not cross suture lines. In our patient, the one-month timeline, venous bleed pattern, and CT morphology strongly favor a subdural process. Therefore, the bridging veins rupture mechanism (option A) is correct. Option B is incorrect because arterial epidural hematomas manifest with acute deterioration and different imaging features. No other vascular structure or traumatic mechanism better fits the gradual onset and radiographic appearance seen here.","conceptual_foundation":"The subdural space lies between the dura mater and arachnoid mater. Bridging veins traverse this potential space, draining cortical surface blood into dural venous sinuses. With age, cerebral atrophy increases the subdural gap and places tension on these veins, making them prone to rupture with minimal or even trivial trauma. Neurologically, venous drainage compromise elevates intracranial pressure, causes mass effect, and displaces brain structures. Conditions such as coagulopathy, anticoagulation therapy, or cerebral amyloid angiopathy further predispose to subdural hemorrhage. In contrast, the middle meningeal artery courses in the epidural space between dura and skull; its rupture yields an epidural hematoma with rapid arterial bleeding. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, bleeding occurs in the subarachnoid space, affecting cerebrospinal fluid. Bridging vein rupture leading to subdural hematoma is therefore a distinct entity with a unique phenotypic presentation: often delayed, venous in origin, and spanning suture lines on imaging. Understanding meningeal layers and vascular anatomy is essential for distinguishing subdural from epidural and subarachnoid processes.","pathophysiology":"Subdural hematoma pathophysiology begins with mechanical shearing of bridging veins at the dura\u2013arachnoid junction. Age-related brain volume loss and increased subdural space amplify vein tension. Molecularly, endothelial injury provokes platelet adhesion, aggregation, and coagulation cascade activation, generating a fibrin\u2013platelet plug. Over days to weeks, rebleeding from fragile neomembranes and ongoing inflammatory cytokine release sustain hematoma expansion. Microglia and astrocytes respond to blood breakdown products (hemoglobin, iron), releasing reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), perpetuating local edema and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in coagulation factor genes or inflammatory cytokine promoters, may influence bleeding severity. Anticoagulants (warfarin, DOACs) potentiate hemorrhage by inhibiting vitamin-K-dependent clotting factors or thrombin. In contrast, epidural hematomas originate from high-pressure arterial rupture, causing rapid mass effect and herniation risk. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves aneurysmal arterial bleeding into cisterns. Thus, bridging vein compromise and subsequent molecular cascades underlie subdural hematoma pathology.","clinical_manifestation":"Subdural hematoma symptoms often evolve over days to weeks. Initial signs may include headache, mild confusion, or drowsiness. As mass effect increases, focal deficits emerge \u2013 contralateral limb weakness, sensory loss, or aphasia depending on location. Our patient\u2019s right-sided weakness reflects a left hemispheric collection. Cognitive changes range from subtle memory impairment to global delirium. Examination may reveal papilledema, contralateral hyperreflexia, and a positive Babinski sign. Acute on chronic bleeds accelerate deterioration, manifesting with stupor or coma. Chronic subdural collections in elderly can remain asymptomatic for extended periods, discovered incidentally or during evaluation for subtle imbalance or gait disturbance. Anticoagulation exacerbates bleeding risk and can mask progression due to minimal trauma history. Prognosis correlates with age, size of hematoma, midline shift magnitude, and Glasgow Coma Scale on presentation. Smaller collections (<10 mm thickness, <5 mm shift) may be managed conservatively, while larger shifts demand surgical evacuation. Early recognition of evolving neurologic deficits is critical for timely intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic workup begins with a noncontrast head CT. A subdural hematoma appears as a crescentic, hyperdense (acute) or isodense/hypodense (subacute/chronic) collection that crosses suture lines. Key measurements include maximal thickness and midline shift. MRI with FLAIR and gradient-echo sequences can detect subtle or chronic blood products, showing layered hyperintensity. CT angiography rules out vascular lesions if indicated. Laboratory tests assess coagulopathy (PT/INR, PTT, platelet count), renal function (for anticoagulation reversal planning), and baseline hematology. Differential diagnoses include epidural hematoma (lens-shaped, does not cross sutures), subarachnoid hemorrhage (cisternal blood), intracerebral hemorrhage (parenchymal), hygroma (CSF density), or mass lesions. Ultrasound may guide bedside assessment in neonates but is not used in adults. In equivocal cases, lumbar puncture is contraindicated if raised intracranial pressure is suspected. Serial imaging monitors hematoma evolution. Brain perfusion CT or MRI can assess ischemic risk from mass effect. Comprehensive evaluation ensures correct diagnosis and guides management.","management_principles":"Treatment depends on neurologic status, hematoma size, and comorbidities. Acute symptomatic subdural hematomas with thickness >10 mm or midline shift >5 mm generally require neurosurgical evacuation. Options include burr-hole drainage for chronic collections or craniotomy/craniectomy for acute or mixed-density lesions. When intracranial pressure is elevated, hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV bolus, repeat every 6 hours as needed; hypertonic saline 23.4% 30 mL bolus) can temporize. Anticoagulant reversal is critical: vitamin K 10 mg IV plus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for warfarin, idarucizumab for dabigatran, and andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors. Seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam (500\u20131000 mg IV/PO twice daily) may be considered in high-risk cases. Monitoring includes serial neurologic exams, intracranial pressure monitoring in critical care, and daily imaging as indicated. Non-pharmacologic measures include head elevation at 30\u00b0, sedation avoidance, and careful blood pressure control (systolic <140 mmHg). Contraindications to surgery include severe coagulopathy, uncontrolled systemic infection, or very low functional status where risks outweigh benefits.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute management, patients require serial imaging at one- to two-week intervals until hematoma resolution or stabilization. Neurologic assessments (Glasgow Coma Scale, focal exam) should be performed daily during hospitalization and weekly after discharge until stable. Long-term complications include seizures, hygroma formation, and cognitive deficits. Physical and occupational therapy address residual motor and executive dysfunction. Anticoagulation resumption is individualized: in atrial fibrillation or mechanical valves, restart after imaging confirms hematoma stability (usually 4\u20136 weeks). Patient education should emphasize fall prevention, compliance with reversal protocols, and avoidance of over-anticoagulation. Head injury risk mitigation includes home safety evaluation, assistive devices for gait instability, and caregiver support. Neuropsychological testing may detect subtle cognitive impairments. Regular follow-up in neurology and neurosurgery clinics ensures early detection of rebleeding or delayed complications.","clinical_pearls":"\u2022 Subdural hematomas in the elderly often follow trivial injury and present insidiously.  \n\u2022 Crescent-shaped collection on CT that crosses sutures but spares the midline falx is pathognomonic.  \n\u2022 Bridging vein rupture yields slower venous bleeding compared to middle meningeal arterial injury in epidural hematoma.  \n\u2022 Chronic subdural hematomas can appear isodense; MRI with gradient-echo is more sensitive.  \n\u2022 Monitor anticoagulation status and correct coagulopathy promptly.  \n\u2022 Burr-hole drainage is ideal for chronic collections; craniotomy suits mixed-density or acute bleeds.  \n\u2022 Postoperative rebleeding risk highest within 48 hours.  \n\u2022 Avoid lumbar puncture if intracranial mass lesion suspected.  \n\u2022 Multidisciplinary care (neurocritical care, rehabilitation) optimizes functional recovery.  \n\u2022 Recent guidelines recommend early reversal of DOACs in intracranial hemorrhage (Class I).","references":"1.

The combination of ischemic stroke, two prior spontaneous abortions, and a prolonged clotting assay (notably lupus anticoagulant prolongs phospholipid-dependent assays) aligns with the revised Sapporo criteria for APS diagnosis. Confirmatory tests include dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) and anticardiolipin IgG/IgM levels on two occasions at least 12 weeks apart. Option B: Prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A) predisposes to venous thromboembolism but is not strongly associated with arterial events or recurrent miscarriages. While heterozygous carriers have a mild to moderate increase in venous clot risk, this variant does not fully explain her arterial ischemia or obstetric complications. In addition, prothrombin gene mutation testing would not guide acute management or secondary prevention for arterial stroke. Therefore, testing for APS antibodies is both clinically and mechanistically the most appropriate next step, guiding risk stratification and long-term anticoagulation strategy.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral ischemic stroke in APS results from thrombotic occlusion of intracranial arteries or cortical microvessels. Key anatomical regions include the middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution, supplying lateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes responsible for motor, sensory, and language function. In APS, endothelial cell activation and complement deposition in cerebral vessels promote platelet adhesion, microthrombi, and downstream infarction. Recurrent miscarriages involve thrombosis in decidual spiral arteries, impairing placental perfusion. Neurologically, APS can mimic multiple sclerosis or small vessel vasculitis, with white matter hyperintensities on MRI reflecting chronic microvascular injury. The neurovascular unit\u2014comprising endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, and neurons\u2014undergoes blood\u2013brain barrier disruption in thromboinflammation. Recognition of stroke subtypes (large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small vessel occlusion) is critical; APS occupies a distinct hypercoagulable category. Understanding these neuroanatomical and vascular pathways underscores the rationale for targeted immunologic and anticoagulant interventions in APS\u2010associated stroke and obstetric morbidity.","pathophysiology":"APS is mediated by autoantibodies against phospholipid\u2013protein complexes, primarily \u03b22-glycoprotein I and cardiolipin. These IgG and IgM antibodies bind endothelial cell surfaces, upregulating tissue factor expression via NF-\u03baB signaling and decreasing anticoagulant thrombomodulin. Platelet activation involves crosslinking Fc\u03b3RIIA receptors, promoting aggregation and microthrombus formation. Complement activation (C3a, C5a) exacerbates endothelial injury. In addition, antibodies interfere with annexin V binding, reducing its anticoagulant shield and further promoting clotting. Genetic factors such as HLA-DR7 and DR4 alleles confer susceptibility, while inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) amplify prothrombotic signaling. In contrast, prothrombin gene G20210A increases prothrombin levels but lacks the autoimmune and complement-mediated amplification seen in APS. Neurotransmitter release is secondarily affected by ischemia, with glutamate excitotoxicity mediated by NMDA receptor overactivation. Thus, APS pathogenesis is a convergence of autoimmunity, complement, coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction culminating in arterial and venous thrombosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with APS may present with acute neurologic deficits consistent with ischemic stroke: sudden hemiparesis, aphasia, visual field cuts, or ataxia depending on the vascular territory. Multifocal transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and cognitive dysfunction may herald microvascular involvement. Obstetric features include three or more consecutive first trimester losses or one second trimester demise due to placental insufficiency. Laboratory findings often reveal thrombocytopenia (mild to moderate), prolonged phospholipid-dependent clotting times, and elevated anticardiolipin titers. Clinical severity ranges from isolated mild headache to catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, characterized by rapid multiorgan thrombosis. Prognostic indicators include persistently high antibody titers, coexisting SLE, and prior thrombosis history. Cutaneous manifestations such as livedo reticularis can signal underlying small vessel occlusion. Arterial strokes in APS tend to occur in younger patients (<50 years) without traditional risk factors, and recurrence is common without appropriate anticoagulation. Careful neurologic examination may reveal carotid bruit or focal cranial nerve deficits if vertebrobasilar systems are implicated.","diagnostic_approach":"In patients with suspected APS\u2010related stroke, the diagnostic algorithm begins with neuroimaging and laboratory evaluation. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging confirms acute infarction, while MR angiography assesses arterial patency. CT angiography may be used if contraindications exist. Laboratory tests for APS include lupus anticoagulant via dRVVT or hexagonal phospholipid neutralization, anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG, IgM) measured by ELISA, and anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I antibodies. Tests must be repeated 12 weeks apart to confirm persistence. A prolonged prothrombin time in isolation suggests vitamin K deficiency or liver dysfunction, but in APS, the PTT is typically prolonged due to phospholipid dependency. Differential diagnoses encompass inherited thrombophilias (factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, carotid atherosclerotic disease, vasculitis (e.g., primary CNS angiitis), and patent foramen ovale with paradoxical embolism. Echocardiography and prolonged cardiac monitoring rule out cardioembolic sources. Genetic testing for prothrombin mutation is reserved for unexplained venous thrombosis without autoimmune features.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy for APS\u2010associated arterial thrombosis is long-term vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation. Target INR is 2.0\u20133.0, with some advocating 3.0\u20134.0 for recurrent events. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred during pregnancy at enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours, with low-dose aspirin (75\u2013100 mg daily) added for obstetric protection. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are generally not recommended in high\u2010risk APS due to trials showing increased arterial events. Hydroxychloroquine (200\u2013400 mg/day) may reduce thrombosis risk via antiplatelet and immunomodulatory effects, particularly in SLE\u2010associated APS. Corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and IVIG are reserved for catastrophic APS. Contraindications include active bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia (<30 \u00d7 10^9/L), and warfarin teratogenicity. Non-pharmacological interventions encompass risk factor modification: smoking cessation, blood pressure control, and lipid management. Careful perioperative bridging with LMWH is necessary when VKA interruption is required.","follow_up_guidelines":"Long-term follow-up includes regular INR monitoring every 2\u20134 weeks until stable, then every 4\u20136 weeks. Repeat antibody assays at 12-week intervals confirm persistence and guide prognosis. Surveillance for warfarin complications (bleeding, skin necrosis), bone density loss, and cataracts is essential. Obstetric follow-up in pregnant patients includes serial ultrasounds to monitor fetal growth and placental function, with Doppler studies of uterine arteries. Thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia should be screened periodically. Lifestyle counseling addresses diet, vitamin K consistency for warfarin management, and exercise. Patients should be educated on stroke warning signs, bleeding risks, and medication adherence. Annual cardiovascular risk assessment with lipid panel, HbA1c, and blood pressure evaluation helps reduce additive atherosclerotic risk. Referral to specialized thrombosis or rheumatology clinics may optimize multidisciplinary care and update therapeutic protocols as new evidence emerges.","clinical_pearls":"1.

It irreversibly inhibits COX\u20101, decreasing TXA2 and platelet aggregation. The IST and CAST trials demonstrated a 1.0\u20131.5% absolute risk reduction in recurrent stroke at 14 days when aspirin is given within 48 h (Lancet 1997;10.1016/S0140-6736). This remains first\u2010line per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines. Pathophysiologically, aspirin addresses platelet\u2010mediated thrombus stabilization in small penetrating vessel lacunar infarcts. Common misconception: waiting for clopidogrel or dual therapy increases bleeding risk without added benefit beyond 24 h in most patients.\n\nOption B (Dual antiplatelets): Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus clopidogrel may reduce early recurrence in high\u2010risk minor stroke/TIA but increases major bleeding by ~0.9% at 90 days (CHANCE trial; N Engl J Med 2013;369:11\u201319). Not indicated beyond 24 h for moderate\u2010large infarcts without high\u2010risk TIA features per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines. DAPT is reserved for symptomatic intracranial stenosis or minor stroke (NIHSS \u22643) within 24 h and for only 21\u2009days.\n\nOption C (IV Labetalol): IV labetalol is a blood pressure\u2013lowering agent used to manage hypertensive emergencies (SBP >220 mm Hg or MAP >130 mm Hg) to prevent hemorrhagic transformation (BP goal <185/110 mm Hg pre\u2010thrombolysis). In a patient outside tPA window with SBP <220 mm Hg, aggressive lowering risks worsening penumbral perfusion. Per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines, permissive hypertension up to 220/120 mm Hg is recommended to maintain collateral flow.\n\nOption D (IV Nitroprusside): Nitroprusside rapidly lowers blood pressure but may cause cerebral steal and intracranial pressure increase. Reserved for malignant hypertension with hypertensive encephalopathy or aortic dissection, not routine ischemic stroke management. Per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines, nitroprusside is not recommended due to risk of raised intracranial pressure and unpredictable cerebral blood flow changes.\n\nOverall, Option A is correct: early aspirin reduces recurrence without undue hemorrhagic risk and is endorsed immediately in all eligible noncardioembolic ischemic strokes outside reperfusion therapies per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines.","conceptual_foundation":"The internal capsule is comprised of anterior and posterior limbs containing corticospinal, corticobulbar, and thalamocortical fibers. The posterior limb transmits motor fibers from primary motor cortex to spinal cord, lateral corticospinal tract, and sensory ascending pathways. Embryologically, the posterior limb arises from the diencephalic\u2013telencephalic junction, guided by netrin and slit signaling for axonal pathfinding. Lacunar infarcts here disrupt contralateral face, arm, and leg motor function (pure motor stroke) while sparing cortical signs due to deep perforator involvement of lenticulostriate arteries from the middle cerebral artery. Collateral flow through the anterior choroidal and anterior cerebral perforators is limited, predisposing to ischemia. Historically, C Miller Fisher first described lacunar syndromes in the 1960s, correlating small vessel lipohyalinosis with pure motor strokes. Recognition of branch atheromatous disease and lipohyalinosis shifted management towards secondary prevention targeting small vessel pathology. Key anatomic landmarks: genu (corticobulbar fibers), posterior limb (corticospinal, superior thalamic radiations), retrolenticular limb (optic radiations). Clinical significance includes pure motor, pure sensory, and sensorimotor lacunar syndromes depending on lesion location.","pathophysiology":"Acute ischemic stroke in the internal capsule involves occlusion of lenticulostriate arterioles. At the molecular level, reduction in ATP impairs Na\u207a/K\u207a\u2010ATPase, causing membrane depolarization, glutamate release, and excitotoxic Ca\u00b2\u207a influx via NMDA and AMPA receptors. Reactive oxygen species form via NADPH oxidase, causing lipid peroxidation. Inflammatory mediators including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and MMP-9 disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier over hours. Lipohyalinosis, due to chronic hypertension, leads to fibrinoid necrosis of small vessels. Genetic predispositions include NOTCH3 mutations in CADASIL, affecting smooth muscle integrity. Microglial activation releases IL-6 and proteases, exacerbating tissue injury. Energy failure triggers anaerobic glycolysis, lactic acidosis, and neuronal death. Penumbral tissue remains viable for approximately 4.5\u20136 h post\u2010onset before infarction. Microcirculatory shunting and leukocyte plugging further impair perfusion. Astrocyte swelling contributes to cytotoxic edema, while vasogenic edema peaks at 3\u20135 days. Endogenous fibrinolysis via plasmin limits clot propagation but is insufficient without intervention.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset began with sudden dysarthria and right\u2010sided weakness 10 h prior. Dysarthria arises from corticobulbar tract involvement; pure motor hemiparesis of face, arm, and leg indicates posterior limb lesion. Neurological exam: right facial droop (Central VII palsy), 0/5 power in right arm and leg, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski on right, intact sensation and coordination. No aphasia or visual field deficits. In elderly patients, lacunar strokes present with less cortical signs but may have cognitive slowing. Pediatric small\u2010vessel strokes are rare and typically secondary to vasculitis or congenital heart disease. Females may report more subjective dizziness and headaches. Systemic manifestations include transient hypertension and stress hyperglycemia. NIH Stroke Scale score of 8 corresponds to moderate stroke severity. Red flags: rapid deterioration, signs of increased intracranial pressure, seizure. Without treatment, risk of early neurological deterioration is ~20% within 48 h, and 1\u2010year mortality approaches 15%. Recovery follows an initial hyperacute phase, plateauing by 3 months without rehabilitation.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Noncontrast CT head immediately to exclude hemorrhage and detect early ischemic signs (sensitivity ~70% first 6 h, specificity ~95%) per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines. Step 2: CT angiography of head/neck to identify large vessel occlusion; sensitivity 90%, specificity 97% (per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines). Step 3: CT perfusion to assess penumbra/core mismatch if endovascular therapy considered (per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines). Step 4: MRI with DWI/ADC within 24 h for confirmation; DWI sensitivity 92%, specificity 97% (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 5: Carotid duplex ultrasound to quantify stenosis; significant if \u226570% (per NASCET criteria, 1991). Step 6: Transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate cardioembolic sources; sensitivity 50\u201360% for thrombus detection (per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines). Step 7: ECG and continuous telemetry for 48\u201372 h to detect atrial fibrillation; yield ~10% initial, additional 10% on prolonged monitoring (per ESC 2020 guidelines). Step 8: Basic labs including CBC, platelets (150\u2013400 \u00d7 10^3/\u03bcL), PT/INR (normal 0.8\u20131.2), glucose (70\u201399 mg/dL), electrolytes (Na 135\u2013145 mEq/L) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Differential: hemorrhage, demyelination, seizure postictal paralysis (Todd\u2019s palsy) distinguished by imaging, CSF if needed.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First\u2010line): Aspirin 325 mg PO once daily starting within 24 h of stroke onset (per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines).

Tier 2 (Second\u2010line): Clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily for patients with aspirin intolerance (per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines). Loading dose 300 mg, then 75 mg daily. Monitor CYP2C19 genotype. Tier 3 (Third\u2010line): Ticagrelor 90 mg PO twice daily if both aspirin and clopidogrel contraindicated (per ESO 2021 guidelines). Non\u2010pharmacological: carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic high\u2010grade ICA stenosis \u226570% within 2 weeks (perioperative stroke/death <6%) per NASCET. Blood pressure management: permissive hypertension up to 220/120 mm Hg (Tier 1) unless contraindicated (per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines). Statin therapy: atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily for LDL <70 mg/dL (per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines). Monitor LFTs every 3 months. Endovascular thrombectomy for LVO within 6\u201324 h window in eligible patients (Tier 2) based on perfusion mismatch (per DAWN trial 2018).","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurology follow\u2010up at 2 weeks post\u2010discharge to assess functional status (modified Rankin Scale goal \u22642). Then quarterly visits for 1 year to monitor risk factor control. Blood pressure target <140/90 mm Hg, HbA1c <7%, LDL <70 mg/dL per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines. Repeat carotid imaging at 6 months if stenosis 50\u201369% initially. Monitor for post\u2010stroke depression (incidence ~30%). 3\u2010month MRI to evaluate infarct evolution. Rehabilitation: PT/OT 5 days/week for 12 weeks. Speech therapy for dysarthria thrice weekly for 8 weeks. Driving withheld for 3 months until assessment. Yearly screening for cognitive impairment with MoCA. Long\u2010term risk of recurrent stroke ~10% at 1 year, 25% at 5 years.

A computed tomography (CT) brain was performed and was normal. He was within the treatment window and IV t-PA was started. Twenty minutes later, the primary nurse called the physician as the patient had abnormal swelling around the mouth (image attached). Blood pressure was normal. Which of the following is the most likely associated risk factor for this condition?","options":["Frontal lobe stroke","ACE inhibitor ## Page 2"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"ACE inhibitor","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B, ACE inhibitor. Angioedema after IV t-PA is a well-recognized, bradykinin-mediated phenomenon that occurs in approximately 1\u20135% of treated patients. Multiple cohort studies (Hill et al. Stroke 2010; Santos et al. Neurology 2012) show that concurrent ACE inhibitor use increases the risk of orolingual angioedema by 3\u20137-fold (adjusted OR \u22485.2, 95% CI 2.1\u201312.8). Frontal lobe strokes have not been linked to t-PA angioedema; instead, insular cortex involvement is the neuroanatomic risk factor. No high-quality evidence supports frontal lobe infarcts as predisposing lesions for post-tPA angioedema, whereas ACE inhibitors have a Level A recommendation in AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines for heightened surveillance during thrombolysis. Common misconceptions include attributing the swelling to allergic reactions to t-PA (which is unlikely given its fibrinolytic mechanism) or to uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure is often normal in these cases).","conceptual_foundation":"Angioedema is a localized, self-limited swelling of submucosal or subcutaneous tissues mediated by vasoactive peptides\u2014principally bradykinin. Under normal physiology, bradykinin is generated via the kallikrein-kinin system and rapidly degraded by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) accelerates plasmin generation, which can further activate the kinin cascade, leading to increased bradykinin. ACE inhibitors block the primary degradation pathway, causing accumulation of bradykinin in vascular beds, particularly in richly vascularized oropharyngeal mucosa. In ICD-11, this falls under 'Hypersensitivity angioedema due to drug use', and differential diagnoses include mast cell-mediated allergic angioedema and hereditary angioedema (C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency). Anatomically, swelling localizes to the lips, tongue, and oropharynx. The condition is distinct from mast cell histamine-mediated angioedema, as it does not typically present with urticaria or pruritus.","pathophysiology":"Normal bradykinin metabolism involves cleavage of kininogens by kallikrein and rapid inactivation by ACE. IV t-PA increases levels of plasmin, which augments kallikrein activity, producing excess bradykinin. In patients on ACE inhibitors, bradykinin catabolism is impaired, allowing its levels to rise unchecked. Elevated bradykinin acts on B2 receptors on endothelial cells, causing vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, leading to submucosal edema. The phenomenon typically manifests within 30\u201360 minutes of starting t-PA. Unlike histamine-mediated angioedema, there is minimal mast cell degranulation; thus, epinephrine and antihistamines have limited efficacy. Genetic factors (e.g., B2 receptor polymorphisms) may also modulate susceptibility, but ACE inhibition remains the primary modifiable risk factor.","clinical_manifestation":"Orolingual angioedema presents acutely during or shortly after t-PA infusion with asymmetric swelling of the lips, tongue, or buccal mucosa. Patients may report tightness of the mouth or tongue, drooling, dysarthria, or difficulty swallowing. Swelling can progress rapidly over minutes to hours and, in severe cases, compromise the airway. In prospective series, 30% of cases required endotracheal intubation. Absence of urticaria, pruritus, or hypotension helps distinguish bradykinin-mediated angioedema from anaphylaxis. Most episodes resolve within 24\u201348 hours with appropriate management.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical. Evaluate airway patency immediately. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy may reveal tongue base swelling. Routine labs are of little diagnostic utility. Measure C4 and C1 esterase inhibitor levels if hereditary angioedema is suspected, but these are typically normal in t-PA\u2013induced cases. No imaging is indicated unless airway compromise is uncertain. Pre-test probability is high in patients on ACE inhibitors receiving t-PA; thus no confirmatory testing is required before initiating treatment.","management_principles":"First, stop t-PA infusion. Secure the airway\u2014early intubation is recommended if there is any sign of airway compromise. Administer high-dose IV corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 125 mg), H1 antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine 50 mg IV), and H2 blockers (e.g., ranitidine 50 mg IV), although their benefit is limited. Icatibant (bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, 30 mg SC) has shown rapid symptom relief in small trials (Straka et al. Stroke 2016). Fresh frozen plasma (to supply ACE) or C1 inhibitor concentrate can be considered in refractory cases but carry thrombotic risk. Avoid epinephrine as monotherapy given minimal mast cell involvement.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor in a high-acuity setting for at least 24 hours. Repeat airway exams every 2\u20134 hours until resolution. Document ACE inhibitor\u2013related angioedema in medical records and permanently discontinue ACE inhibitors; switch to alternative antihypertensives (e.g., ARBs or calcium channel blockers). Educate patient on signs of recurrent angioedema. No chronic prophylaxis is indicated unless other risk factors arise.","clinical_pearls":"1. ACE inhibitor use is the strongest modifiable risk factor for t-PA\u2013related angioedema; consider withholding ACE inhibitors before planned thrombolysis when possible. 2. Swelling typically occurs contralateral to the cerebral infarct; insular involvement\u2014not frontal lobe\u2014is the anatomic risk factor. 3. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema lacks urticaria and does not reliably respond to epinephrine alone. 4. Early fiberoptic airway assessment guides timing of intubation; delay can lead to rapid airway loss. 5. Icatibant offers targeted relief by blocking B2 receptors and may shorten edema duration.","references":"1. Hill MD, Buchan AM.
