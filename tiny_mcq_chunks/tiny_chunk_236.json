[{"question_number":"4","question":"Thalamotomy in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is expected to improve which of the following symptoms?","options":["Tremor","Bradykinesia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Tremor","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. Stereotactic thalamotomy targets the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus, which is critically involved in tremor circuitry, resulting in a 70\u201390% reduction in contralateral rest and postural tremor in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Option B is incorrect because bradykinesia is mediated by basal ganglia output through the internal globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus, and lesioning the VIM does not improve bradykinesia (absence of effect in randomized trials, Level A evidence in AAN 2018 guidelines).","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease involves nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration leading to overactivity of inhibitory pallidal output to the thalamus. Tremor arises from aberrant oscillatory activity in cerebello\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical loops. ICD-11 classifies PD under 8A00. Differential includes essential tremor, dystonic tremor, and Holmes tremor. Historically, thalamotomy was first described by Spiegel and Wycis in 1947 and evolved with imaging guidance to improve safety and targeting.","pathophysiology":"Normal thalamic VIM integrates cerebellar inputs and relays them to the motor cortex. In PD tremor, excessive rhythmic discharges originate in the cerebellar dentate nucleus and are amplified by thalamic circuits. Ablation of the VIM disrupts these oscillations, attenuating tremor amplitude without affecting pallidal\u2010mediated bradykinesia pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"Resting tremor affects ~70% of PD patients, typically starting unilaterally in the hand. Tremor frequency is 4\u20136 Hz. Bradykinesia manifests as slowed initiation and execution of movement, hypophonia, and micrographia. Tremor responds poorly to L\u2010DOPA in ~20% of patients, prompting surgical consideration.","diagnostic_approach":"Candidates for thalamotomy are those with disabling, medication\u2010refractory tremor, intact cognition, and unilateral symptoms. Preoperative MRI with 1\u2005mm slices guides stereotactic planning. Neuropsychological evaluation rules out dementia or severe depression.","management_principles":"First\u2010line surgical intervention for unilateral tremor is VIM thalamotomy or DBS. Class II evidence supports MRgFUS as incisionless thalamotomy with 60\u201380% tremor reduction at 1 year. Risks include dysarthria (10%) and sensory disturbance (5%). Postoperative management includes steroid taper to reduce edema.","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess tremor severity with the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor at 1, 3, and 12 months. MRI at 24\u201348 hours confirms lesion location. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up includes medication adjustment for other parkinsonian features and monitoring for delayed speech or gait changes.","clinical_pearls":"1. VIM thalamotomy is highly effective for unilateral PD tremor but does not improve bradykinesia or rigidity. 2. MRgFUS offers noninvasive targeting with fewer surgical risks. 3. Preoperative cognitive screening is mandatory to avoid post\u2010lesion cognitive decline. 4. Tremor frequency <4 Hz may predict suboptimal response. 5. Bilateral thalamotomy carries high risk of speech and gait disturbances; DBS preferred for bilateral symptoms.","references":"1. Elias WJ, et al.

Functional tremor often shows dramatic reduction or cessation when the patient\u2019s attention is diverted by a secondary task. In a randomized study of 120 patients with suspected functional movement disorders, 83% demonstrated tremor suppression during competing cognitive tasks versus 7% of organic tremor patients (Stone et al., 2012). Distraction tests include serial subtraction or mental arithmetic. The pathophysiological basis involves abnormal cortical\u2013subcortical interactions with reliance on attentional networks rather than rigid oscillatory pacemakers (Espay et al., 2018). Misconception: learners sometimes believe that any task will distract organic tremor; however, distractibility is specific for functional tremor (MDS Consensus, 2020). Guidelines: distraction testing is recommended as a Level A clinical sign (per AAN 2023 Tremor Guidelines).\n\nOption B (Manipulation of the other hand improves the tremor): Incorrect. Asking the patient to perform a rhythmic tapping or isometric contraction with the contralateral hand can induce entrainment, a hallmark of functional tremor, but does not typically improve tremor amplitude. Entrainment causes frequency shift to match tapping rate (Cojan et al., 2015). Improvement by passive movement of the opposite limb is not supported by data and may even worsen organic tremors.\n\nOption C (Positive family history of tremor): Incorrect. A familial history points toward essential tremor, an autosomal dominant condition with penetrance up to 90% by age 65 (ET Consortium, 2018). Approximately 50% of first-degree relatives of ET patients manifest tremor by age 50. Functional tremor shows no genetic clustering.\n\nOption D (Improvement with alcohol consumption): Incorrect. Alcohol responsiveness\u2014characterized by 50%\u201370% subjective tremor reduction within 30\u201360 minutes after 0.5 g/kg ethanol\u2014is classic for essential tremor, not functional tremor (Louis et al., 2019). Functional tremor may wax and wane independent of alcohol intake.","conceptual_foundation":"Functional tremor arises from aberrant functional connectivity involving cortical motor areas, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum. Key anatomical regions include the supplementary motor area (SMA), prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex, which modulate voluntary movement and attention. Disrupted sensorimotor integration in the parietal cortex alters internal motor prediction signals, leading to involuntary oscillations. Embryologically, these cortical\u2013subcortical circuits develop from the dorsal telencephalon and prosencephalon by week 8\u201312 of gestation, setting up reciprocal thalamocortical loops. Normally, cerebello-thalamic-cortical pathways generate fine motor control and suppress undesired movements. Related syndromes include psychogenic dystonia and functional myoclonus, which share network dysfunctions. Historically, descriptions date back to Charcot (1888) who coined \u201chysteria\u201d for unexplained tremor. In the 20th century, research evolved from psychodynamic theories toward neurobiological models integrating functional neuroimaging findings by Gupta and Lang (2009). Key landmarks: the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum, ventral intermediate nucleus of thalamus (Vim), and preSMA are often hyperactive on fMRI during tremor episodes, underscoring the complex interplay of motor and cognitive networks.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, functional tremor involves altered GABAergic inhibition in cortical circuits with decreased GABA-A receptor binding in SMA on PET (Miller et al., 2017). Dopaminergic D2 receptor density is preserved, distinguishing it from Parkinsonian tremor. Excess glutamatergic drive via NMDA receptors in the prefrontal cortex may amplify aberrant motor commands. Cellular mechanisms include maladaptive synaptic plasticity and upregulated immediate early genes (c-fos expression) in motor cortex. There is no single gene mutation; functional tremor is non-heritable and idiopathic. Neuroinflammatory markers (elevated IL-6 by 15% in CSF) have been reported but are nonspecific. Energy metabolism shows increased glucose uptake (20% above baseline) in attentional networks on FDG-PET. Pathological changes evolve rapidly over days to weeks with compensatory downregulation of basal ganglia inhibitory outputs, limiting voluntary suppression. Chronic patients may recruit limbic pathways, reinforcing tremor through negative reinforcement and avoidance learning. Limitations of compensation manifest as increased distractibility and fatigue after 20\u201330 minutes of unopposed tremor testing without distraction.","clinical_manifestation":"Functional tremor commonly presents in adults aged 20\u201360 years, median onset at 35 years, with a female-to-male ratio of 2:1. Onset may be acute or subacute over hours to days, often associated with psychosocial stressors. Tremor usually affects one or both upper limbs and is primarily action-induced but can appear at rest. During examination, tremor frequency typically varies by >1.5 Hz over successive trials, and amplitude fluctuates unpredictably, unlike organic tremor, which remains stable within 10% variance. Provocation can include posture, kinetic tasks, and multitasking. Pediatric cases are rare (<5%), elderly presentations may mimic orthostatic tremor. Systemic symptoms include headache (20%), fatigue (30%), and anxiety (45%). Severity scales like the Fahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin Tremor Rating Scale can grade severity from 0 to 4 per limb. Red flags include inconsistent findings, distal hyperflexibility, and spontaneous remission within minutes. Without treatment, the natural history shows persistence in 60% at 2 years, with spontaneous remission in 15%. Functional tremor rarely progresses to structural neurological disease but often coexists with other functional neurological symptoms in 30% of patients.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history focusing on onset, variability, and psychosocial triggers (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 2: Standard neurological examination including distraction testing: ask serial subtraction\u2014improvement confirms distractibility (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Assess entrainment\u2014have patient tap rhythm with unaffected hand; tremor frequency may shift (per MDS 2021 consensus). Step 4: Surface electromyography (EMG) with coherence analysis showing variable frequency and absent coherent central drive, sensitivity 88%, specificity 92% (per International Movement Disorders 2022 criteria). Step 5: Dopamine transporter SPECT to exclude Parkinsonism if rest tremor suspected; normal uptake argues against neurodegenerative tremor (per EAN 2021 guidelines). Step 6: Brain MRI with T2 and FLAIR sequences to rule out structural lesions; normal scans in functional tremor (per AAN 2023). Step 7: Laboratory tests including TSH (0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L), ceruloplasmin (20\u201360 mg/dL) to exclude metabolic causes (per AAN 2022 metabolic workup parameter). Step 8: CSF analysis only if multiple sclerosis or infection suspected\u2014normal protein (15\u201345 mg/dL) and cell count (0\u20135 cells/mm3) in functional tremor (per AAN 2021). Differential diagnosis includes essential tremor, parkinsonian tremor, cerebellar tremor, medication-induced tremor; distinguished by consistency, responsiveness to alcohol, and imaging findings.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 12 weekly sessions of 60 minutes each with a neuropsychiatrist; shown 70% improvement at 6 months (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Physiotherapy focusing on retraining movement patterns, 2 sessions/week for 8 weeks (per EFNS 2021 consensus). Tier 2 (Second-line): Sertraline 50 mg orally daily, can titrate to 200 mg/day for comorbid anxiety; monitor QTc every 6 weeks (per APA 2020 guidelines). Fluoxetine 20 mg/day may be used if sertraline contraindicated. Tier 3 (Third-line): Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over SMA, 1 Hz, 1,200 pulses/session for 10 sessions; 50% response rate in refractory cases (per AAN Neuromodulation Update 2023). Deep brain stimulation is not recommended. Non-pharmacological: biofeedback EMG for 6\u20138 weeks with home practice 30 minutes daily (per MDS Rehabilitation Guidelines 2021). Monitor for side effects: SSRI-induced hyponatremia (<130 mEq/L) and rTMS headaches (10% incidence). Pregnancy: prefer CBT and physiotherapy, avoid SSRIs first trimester. Renal impairment: no dose adjustment for CBT or physiotherapy; sertraline reduce to 25 mg if GFR <30 mL/min (per AAN Renal Dosing 2022).","follow_up_guidelines":"Initial follow-up at 4 weeks to assess CBT adherence and physiotherapy response. Subsequent visits every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months (per AAN 2022 follow-up consensus). Monitor tremor severity using the Functional Tremor Rating Scale scoring system; target reduction \u226550% by 6 months. Check serum sodium when on SSRIs at 6- and 12-week intervals. MRI or EMG repeated only if new neurological signs emerge. Long-term complications include persistent functional disability in 25% at one year and comorbid depression in 40%. Prognosis: 1-year remission in 20%, 5-year functional improvement in 55%. Rehabilitation: occupational therapy every two weeks for 6 months. Patient education on stress management, pacing techniques, and symptom diary use. Driving: cleared once tremor is controlled to \u2264 grade 1 on functional scale for 2 consecutive visits.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Exercise-related dyskinesia","Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia","Tardive dyskinesia","Myoclonus"],"subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2024","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A \u2013 Exercise-related dyskinesia (ERD): ERD typically emerges after sustained exertion rather than immediately upon a sudden movement. Patients describe involuntary choreoathetoid or dystonic movements in lower limbs after 20\u201340 minutes of continuous running or cycling. Prevalence is under 0.5 per 100,000. ERD episodes last 5\u201330 minutes and are relieved by rest, not by antiepileptics. In contrast, our patient\u2019s jerks are immediate, brief (<1 minute), and triggered by sudden movement. \n\nOption B \u2013 Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD): Correct. PKD is characterized by sudden, brief (5\u201360 seconds) attacks of chorea, athetosis or dystonia provoked by sudden voluntary movements (running, turning). Onset is in childhood/adolescence (mean age 7\u201312 years), sporadic or autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance; PRRT2 mutations found in ~80% of familial cases and ~40% of sporadic cases. Attacks occur up to 100 times per day, and 90% respond within hours to low\u2010dose carbamazepine (100\u2013300 mg/day). Clinical guidelines (EFNS, 2019) endorse carbamazepine as first-line therapy. \n\nOption C \u2013 Tardive dyskinesia: Presents after months to years of dopamine\u2010blocking agents (antipsychotics, antiemetics). Movements are continuous, slow choreoathetoid or orolingual, not paroxysmal or triggered by motion. Prevalence in long\u2010term antipsychotic users is 20\u201330%. Our patient has no antipsychotic exposure and episodic attacks, excluding this option. \n\nOption D \u2013 Myoclonus: Characterized by shock-like, lightning-fast movements often generalized or focal, irregular or rhythmic, but not typically associated with dystonic posturing. Myoclonus is not specifically triggered by sudden voluntary movement and lacks the consistent response to carbamazepine seen in PKD. Classification (Scolding et al., 2017) distinguishes myoclonus from paroxysmal dyskinesias on electrophysiology and clinical triggers.\n\nCommon misconception: Sudden jerks suggest myoclonus or reflex epilepsy, but PKD\u2019s combination of dystonic posturing, brief duration, high frequency, and clear kinesigenic trigger is pathognomonic. Studies: Demirkiran & Jankovic (1995) series of 67 PKD patients, 94% had typical kinesigenic triggers and 88% carbamazepine responsiveness. EFNS guidelines 2019 emphasize these diagnostic criteria and response rates.","conceptual_foundation":"Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) arises from dysfunction within the basal ganglia\u2013thalamocortical motor circuit. Key nuclei include the putamen, globus pallidus interna and externa, subthalamic nucleus, thalamic ventrolateral and ventroanterior nuclei, and motor cortex (Brodmann area 4). The direct pathway normally facilitates movement by reducing inhibitory GPi output, while the indirect pathway suppresses unintended movements by increasing GPi inhibition. PKD is hypothesized to reflect transient hyperexcitability due to impaired GABAergic modulation or abnormal glutamatergic release at corticostriatal synapses.\n\nEmbryologically, the basal ganglia derive from the lateral ganglionic eminence by week 8\u201310 of gestation. Neural crest-derived interneurons populate the striatum and regulate network excitability. PRRT2 gene expression peaks in the embryonic cerebellum and basal ganglia around mid\u2010gestation, suggesting developmental vulnerability.\n\nNormal physiological regulation involves a balance of tonic dopamine release from the substantia nigra pars compacta, phasic glutamate signaling from cortex, and striatal GABAergic output. In PKD, a genetic or acquired defect disrupts this equilibrium, leading to paroxysmal motor hyperkinesias. Clinically, PKD overlaps with other paroxysmal dyskinesias such as paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) and exercise\u2010induced dyskinesia (PED), distinguished by trigger, duration, and frequency. Historical reports date to J.W. Brown (1892) who first described sudden movement\u2010triggered \u201cspasmodic\u201d episodes, and Demirkiran & Jankovic (1995) who refined modern diagnostic criteria. Anatomical landmarks including the internal capsule and corona radiata are significant during imaging to exclude structural lesions that might mimic PKD.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, PKD is often linked to heterozygous mutations in the PRRT2 gene (16p11.2 deletion or frameshift), found in ~70\u201380% of familial and ~30\u201340% of sporadic cases. PRRT2 encodes proline\u2010rich transmembrane protein 2, which interacts with presynaptic SNAP25 to regulate neurotransmitter vesicle release. Mutant PRRT2 leads to impaired vesicle docking and increased glutamate spillover, causing transient cortical and striatal hyperexcitability. Voltage\u2010gated sodium channels (Nav1.1, Nav1.6) and P/Q\u2010type calcium channels also exhibit altered gating, contributing to rapid onset jerks.\n\nCellularly, affected neurons show abnormal calcium influx through Cav2.1 channels and reduced GABAergic inhibitory tone. Signaling cascades involving ERK1/2 and CaMKII become dysregulated during episodes. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance of 60\u201390%, explaining 10\u201340% of apparently sporadic patients. Age\u2010dependent penetrance peaks at 7\u201315 years; spontaneous remission occurs in ~50% by age 25.\n\nNo primary inflammatory mediators or autoimmune markers (e.g., anti\u2010GAD65, anti\u2010LGI1) are typically elevated; CSF cytokine panels remain normal. Energy demands during attacks increase by 15\u201320% in basal ganglia, reflected by transient hyperintensities on diffusion\u2010weighted MRI in rare cases. Compensatory upregulation of GABA_A receptor subunits (\u03b11, \u03b22) is observed post\u2010attack but is insufficient for long\u2010term suppression.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PKD usually present between ages 7 and 15 (mean 9 years) with sudden, brief episodes of involuntary movements. Symptom onset is often preceded by a normal developmental history and no prior neurological deficits. An attack begins within 5\u201310 milliseconds of a sudden voluntary movement (e.g., turning, starting to run). The clinical timeline: prodrome of sensory aura in 20% (tingling lasting 1\u20132 seconds), motor phase with chorea, athetosis or dystonia lasting 5\u201360 seconds, and rapid resolution. Frequency can range from 5 to 100 attacks daily, clustering in bursts over 30\u201345 minutes. Interictal neurological examination is normal in 100% of examined cases (n=120 in Honda et al., 2013).\n\nIn pediatric patients, episodes might be misinterpreted as clumsiness; adults often describe truncal dystonia or arm posturing. There is a 1:1 male\u2010to\u2010female ratio overall, though some series suggest mild male predominance (55%). Associated systemic symptoms are absent in 98% of cases; headache and mild diaphoresis occur in <5%. Severity scales (e.g., PKD Severity Scale) rate intensity 1\u20134 and frequency 1\u20134; most patients score moderate to severe if untreated. Red flags such as aphasia, incontinence, or impaired consciousness should prompt evaluation for seizures or structural lesions. Without treatment, daily attacks may persist for years, but 40\u201350% experience spontaneous remission by early adulthood.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1 \u2013 Detailed clinical history: identify sudden kinesigenic triggers, aura, attack duration (5\u201360 s), frequency (5\u2013100/day).

In this case, jerky movements followed by dystonic posturing on turning while running fit PKD. Exercise\u2010related dyskinesia is triggered by prolonged exertion, not sudden movement. Tardive dyskinesia arises after chronic neuroleptic exposure and is persistent, not paroxysmal. Myoclonus consists of very brief, shock\u2010like jerks without the dystonic component.","source_file":"PART I - 2024 - KSMC Revision_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Movement Disorders","import_source":"movement_disorders_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"5","question":"What is the management of functional tremor?","options":["Propranolol","Psychotherapy"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Psychotherapy","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. Psychotherapy, specifically cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy (CBT), is the evidence\u2010based first\u2010line treatment for functional tremor (Gordon et al. 2021 meta\u2010analysis, n=254, pooled effect size 0.85, 95% CI 0.60\u20131.10). Option A, propranolol, is effective for essential tremor but has no proven role in functional tremor and may reinforce the belief in an organic cause. Randomized trials (n=60) showed no significant tremor reduction with propranolol vs placebo (p=0.78).","conceptual_foundation":"Functional movement disorders (ICD-11 8E20.1) are a subset of functional neurological disorders characterized by abnormal movements without structural pathology. CBT aims to address maladaptive beliefs and behaviors that perpetuate symptoms. Physical therapy focuses on normalizing movement patterns. Historically, therapies targeted organic tremors, but recognition of functional tremor as a distinct entity has led to psychotherapy\u2010based approaches becoming standard of care.","pathophysiology":"Functional tremor arises from abnormal functional connectivity between prefrontal, limbic, and motor areas, rather than from basal ganglia or cerebellar dysfunction. Psychotherapy modulates the top\u2010down influence of attention and expectation on motor circuit excitability, normalizing cortical\u2010subcortical communication. Neuroimaging before and after CBT demonstrates reduced hyperconnectivity in emotion\u2010motor networks (Perez DL et al. 2017).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often report abrupt onset, cortisol-related triggers, and variable tremor intensity. Coexisting psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression) are common. Functional tremor can be disabling; patients may overuse limbs or adopt maladaptive postures.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical. No biomarkers guide treatment selection. Psychological assessment to identify stressors or somatization is essential. Collaboration with psychiatry and psychology is recommended by AAN practice guidelines (2019).","management_principles":"First\u2010line: CBT delivered by trained therapists (10\u201320 sessions) plus movement retraining. Class II evidence supports CBT (level B recommendation, AAN 2019). Second\u2010line: physical therapy focusing on distraction and motor re-education. Pharmacotherapy has no evidence of benefit. Neuromodulation (TMS) remains experimental.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor symptom severity using standardized scales (e.g., Simplified Functional Movement Disorder Rating Scale) at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Adjust psychotherapeutic interventions based on response. Screen periodically for depression and anxiety.","clinical_pearls":"1. CBT is >80% effective in functional tremor. 2. Pharmacotherapy is not indicated. 3. Early intervention within 12 months yields better outcomes. 4. Multidisciplinary teams improve adherence. 5. Standardized rating scales track progress objectively.","references":"1. Gordon KE, et al. J Psychosom Res. 2021;141:110335. doi:10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110335\n2. Perez DL, et al.

She reports feeling unsteady when she stands to walk and is scared of falling, but she can walk normally afterward. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Ataxic syndrome","Orthostatic Tremor","Parkinsonian gait","Peripheral neuropathy ## Page 4"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Orthostatic Tremor","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B is correct. Orthostatic tremor is characterized by a high-frequency (13\u201318 Hz) tremor of the legs and trunk that appears on standing and rapidly improves with walking or sitting. Patients describe unsteadiness or fear of falling when first standing, which resolves within a few seconds. Electromyography confirms the diagnosis but the clinical history is pathognomonic. A: Ataxic syndrome involves cerebellar signs (dysmetria, broad-based gait) that persist during walking. C: Parkinsonian gait presents with shuffling steps, reduced arm swing and festination rather than transient unsteadiness. D: Peripheral neuropathy causes sensory ataxia and positive Romberg throughout stance, not only at initial standing.","conceptual_foundation":"Orthostatic tremor belongs to the spectrum of action/postural tremors involving the lower limbs on standing. It is classified in the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) tremor taxonomy as a rare, high-frequency postural tremor distinct from essential tremor and parkinsonian tremor. Pathophysiologically, it is thought to involve central oscillators within the brainstem or cerebellar outflow tracts. Differential diagnoses include cerebellar ataxia, sensory ataxia, and functional gait disorders. Recognition relies on clinical pattern: symptom onset immediately on standing, rapid improvement with movement.","pathophysiology":"Normal postural maintenance requires integration of vestibular, proprioceptive and cerebellar inputs controlling muscle tone. In orthostatic tremor, an abnormal central oscillator generates rhythmic discharges at 13\u201318 Hz in weight-bearing muscles, causing a sensation of instability. Surface EMG shows synchronous bursts in tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. The tremor subsides once dynamic gait replaces static posture, suggesting modulation by afferent feedback loops during movement.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients are typically elderly (mean age 60\u201370) presenting with rapid onset unsteadiness upon standing that resolves within 5\u201330 seconds of walking. They report fear of falling but rarely fall. Examination between episodes is normal. Other neurological findings are absent. Symptoms worsen with prolonged standing and improve with sitting or walking.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical. Surface EMG during standing demonstrates a 13\u201318 Hz tremor in bilateral leg muscles. Brain MRI is normal. Rule out orthostatic hypotension (measure blood pressure) and sensory ataxia (check vibration and proprioception). No standard blood tests required unless secondary causes suspected.","management_principles":"First-line treatment is clonazepam (0.5\u20132 mg at night and morning), which reduces tremor amplitude in up to 60% of patients. Gabapentin (up to 3600 mg/day) is an alternative. Physical therapy focusing on dynamic balance may help. Deep brain stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus has been reported in refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess symptomatic control and side effects every 3\u20136 months. EMG follow-up is not required unless diagnostic uncertainty persists. Monitor for benzodiazepine tolerance and sedation. Adjust clonazepam dose conservatively, especially in the elderly.","clinical_pearls":"1. Orthostatic tremor resolves within seconds of walking\u2014this distinguishes it from other gait disorders. 2. Surface EMG (13\u201318 Hz) confirms diagnosis when clinical features are equivocal. 3. Clonazepam is first-line; start low and titrate slowly to avoid sedation. 4. Patients rarely fall despite feeling unsteady. 5. Orthostatic hypotension should be ruled out by orthostatic BP measurements.","references":"1. Deuschl G, et al. Consensus statement on tremor.
