Patients present with proximal weakness, respiratory crises, and scoliosis. Distal involvement and worsened symptoms with inhibitors are atypical. Misdiagnosis occurs when distal signs mimic other neuromuscular junction disorders, leading to incorrect therapy. Historically.\n\nOption B (RAPSN): Patients with RAPSN mutations often respond to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, exhibiting ptosis, ocular and limb weakness. Onset is usually neonatal or infancy with fluctuating symptoms improved by treatment. Presentation typically lacks severe facial and generalized distribution that worsens paradoxically under cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, so it is incorrect here.\n\nOption C (CHRNE): Defects in CHRNE encoding the adult epsilon subunit of the acetylcholine receptor lead to slow channel congenital myasthenic syndrome with distal and proximal weakness, facial involvement, and worsening on cholinesterase inhibitors. This clinical phenotype matches the described presentation, establishing CHRNE as the definitive diagnosis, recognized pathognomonic marker.\n\nOption D (FCMS): Mutations in GFPT1 cause fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FCMS) characterized by joint contractures, polyhydramnios, and reduced fetal movements. Postnatal presentation includes weakness but not selective facial manifestations worsened by inhibitors. It is purely neuromuscular with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, thus not fitting the described inhibitor paradox, clinically incompatible.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) consists of the presynaptic motor nerve terminal, synaptic cleft, and postsynaptic muscle membrane with acetylcholine (ACh) receptors clustered. The embryological development of the NMJ begins around week eight with agrin-mediated clustering of ACh receptors at endplates. Normal physiology involves presynaptic release of ACh, diffusion across 50\u2009nm synaptic cleft, and binding to nicotinic ACh receptors composed of alpha, beta, delta, and either gamma (fetal) or epsilon (adult) subunits. The safety factor of neuromuscular transmission ensures endplate potentials exceed threshold. Related conditions include Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome with presynaptic calcium channel autoantibodies, autoimmune myasthenia gravis targeting postsynaptic AChR, MuSK, or LRP4. Historically, early 20th century observations by Mary Walker demonstrated edrophonium\u2019s transient reversal of myasthenic weakness. Landmark anatomical landmarks include the primary motor cortex, corticospinal tract, anterior horn, ventral root, and intramuscular nerve branching. Clinical significance arises in lesions affecting any component, from central motor neuron to NMJ proteostasis, resulting in fatigable weakness. Evolution of understanding advanced through genetic identification of CHRNE mutations in 1995 and development of tiered treatment algorithms.","pathophysiology":"Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) arise from germline mutations in genes encoding NMJ proteins. CHRNE mutations disrupt epsilon subunit assembly of adult ACh receptors, producing slow channel kinetics with prolonged open times and cationic overload. Excessive Ca2+ influx triggers endplate myopathy via calpain activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Inheritance is autosomal recessive, with allele frequencies varying by population (carrier rate ~1/2500 in Europe). Cellular signaling cascades involve Agrin-LRP4-MuSK phosphorylation; CHRNE defects perturb clustering. Inflammatory mediators are minimal since CMS lacks autoimmunity. Energy requirements escalate as ATPases attempt to restore ionic gradients, depleting muscle fiber reserves during repeated stimulation. Time course: newborns exhibit hypotonia, feeding difficulties weeks after birth; slow channel forms may present later. Compensatory upregulation of gamma subunit occurs transiently during fetal life but fails postnatally. Secondary postsynaptic membrane remodeling and fiber type switching (from type II to type I) reflect chronic stress. Limitations of compensation lead to progressive fatigability and weakness despite therapeutic interventions.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of CHRNE\u2010related CMS typically occurs in infancy with hypotonia and feeding difficulties, progressing over weeks to months. Peak severity often arises by age two with generalized weakness. Neurological exam reveals ptosis, facial muscle paresis, neck flexor weakness, proximal and distal limb weakness (Medical Research Council grade 3\u20134/5), and fatigability on repetitive testing. Deep tendon reflexes are preserved. Pediatric presentations may include arthrogryposis in severe alleles. Adults present milder fluctuating weakness. No gender predilection. Associated features include respiratory insufficiency, bulbar involvement, and delayed motor milestones. Severity scales use Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score adapted for CMS, with grade 10\u201315 indicating moderate disease. Red flags: abrupt respiratory compromise without infection, paradoxical deterioration on cholinesterase inhibitors. Without treatment, natural history shows gradual worsening during infections and stressors, with intermittent crises requiring ventilation. Severity correlates with residual receptor function. Facial sparing variant is less common. Regular assessments of forced vital capacity and swallow studies guide risk stratification. Long-term outcomes depend on early diagnosis and management to prevent irreversible myopathy.","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with clinical evaluation of fatigable weakness and family history (Tier 1). Per AAN 2023 guidelines, perform repetitive nerve stimulation at 3\u2009Hz, showing decrement >10% (sensitivity 75%, specificity 85%) (AAN 2023). Next, single-fiber EMG demonstrating increased jitter (>55\u2009\u03bcs) confirms NMJ defect (Tier 1) (AAN 2023). If CMS is suspected, obtain genetic panel covering CHRNE, RAPSN, DOK7, GFPT1 (Tier 2) (Consensus Statement on Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes 2022). Serum autoantibodies (AChR, MuSK) should be negative (Tier 1) (AAN 2023). Chest MRI with T1 and T2 sequences rules out thymoma when autoantibodies are present, though rare in CMS (Tier 2) (ILAE 2021). Laboratory tests include CK (normal to mildly elevated, normal range 30\u2013200\u2009U/L) and TFTs to exclude endocrine causes (Tier 2) (AAN 2023). CSF is typically normal without pleocytosis or elevated protein (Tier 3) (AAN 2023). Differential diagnoses include autoimmune myasthenia gravis, LEMS, mitochondrial myopathy, and congenital muscular dystrophy; each distinguished by antibody status, electrophysiology, or muscle biopsy findings. Genetic confirmation establishes diagnosis and guides management (Tier 1) (Consensus Statement 2022).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Administer pyridostigmine orally at 1\u20132\u2009mg/kg/dose every four to six hours (max 600\u2009mg/day) with gradual titration (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). If slow channel phenotype, use long\u2010acting open\u2010channel blockers: fluoxetine 5\u2009mg/kg/day divided BID (max 80\u2009mg/day) or quinidine 10\u2009mg/kg/day divided TID (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2021). Monitor heart rhythm and QTc. Tier 2 (Second-line): Add albuterol orally 2\u2009mg TID (10\u2009mg/day) in refractory cases (per Consensus Statement on CMS 2022). Monitor blood pressure. Tier 3 (Third-line): Consider oral 3,4\u2010diaminopyridine at 0.5\u2009mg/kg TID (max 80\u2009mg/day) if first-line fails (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Non-pharmacological: respiratory physiotherapy, occupational therapy (per AAN 2022). Surgical: rarely thymectomy is contraindicated in CMS. Monitor for cholinergic side effects: diarrhea, bradycardia; co-administer atropine 0.01\u2009mg/kg IV for acute cholinergic crisis (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). In pregnancy, reduce pyridostigmine to lowest effective dose; avoid fluoxetine in first trimester. For renal impairment, adjust dosing interval by 25%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up intervals: initial re-evaluation at four weeks after treatment initiation, then every three months for the first year (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Monitor clinical strength scores and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis scale aiming for <5 points improvement target. Laboratory surveillance: baseline and annual liver function tests, CK levels quarterly. Imaging: chest MRI every two years if thymic abnormalities. Long-term complications include fixed contractures in 10% and respiratory crises in 30% of untreated cases. Prognosis: with early intervention, 1-year complete remission in 60%, 5-year stable minimal symptoms in 80%. Rehabilitation: start physical therapy within first month, occupational therapy by three months. Patient education: teach crisis recognition, medication adherence, and emergency contacts. Advise against high-risk activities during peak weakness. Driving may resume when strength remains >4/5 for two consecutive visits. Recommend support groups such as Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America and CMS patient registries for resources and advocacy.","clinical_pearls":"1. CHRNE mutations produce slow channel kinetics; patients worsen with cholinesterase inhibitors. 2. Paradoxical response to pyridostigmine is pathognomonic for slow channel CMS. 3. Remember the MAMP mnemonic: MuSK, AChR, MuSK-negative autoantibody, Presynaptic disorders. 4. Distinguish autoimmune myasthenia gravis by positive anti-AChR antibodies and thymoma risk. 5. 3,4-DAP can be life-saving in refractory ion-channel CMS (emerging consensus 2022). 6. Avoid fluoxetine in pregnancy due to teratogenic risk; prefer quinidine under ECG monitoring. 7. Early genetic diagnosis reduces unnecessary immunosuppression and surgical interventions. 8. Recent guideline changes emphasize tiered therapy and early albuterol adjunct (EFNS 2021). 9. Pitfall: normal CK does not exclude severe CMS; rely on electrophysiology and genetics. 10. Quality of life improves significantly with multidisciplinary care including respiratory support and physical therapy.","references":"1. Engel AG, Ohno K. Congenital myasthenic syndromes.

Becker muscular dystrophy (A) typically presents with proximal weakness without early contractures or conduction block. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (B) presents with proximal weakness but lacks early contractures and prominent cardiac conduction disease. Multiple clinical series (Bonne et al. 2000, Circ 101:21\u201327) and AAN practice parameters (2009) highlight EDMD\u2019s triad of contractures, muscle weakness, and cardiomyopathy as pathognomonic.","conceptual_foundation":"Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is classified under muscular dystrophies in ICD-11 (8C70.3) and arises from mutations in nuclear envelope proteins (emerin, LMNA). EDMD was first described by Emery and Dreifuss in 1966; it evolved from being considered a variant of X-linked dystrophinopathies to a distinct laminopathy group. Differential considerations include other laminopathies (e.g., Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy) and nonspecific myopathies with conduction defects.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle and cardiac conduction depend on nuclear envelope integrity. In EDMD, emerin (X\u2010linked) or lamin A/C (autosomal) mutations disrupt nuclear\u2013cytoskeletal interactions, leading to muscle fiber fragility, fibrosis, and fibrofatty replacement of the conduction system. This results in early contractures from periarticular fibrosis and predisposes to atrial dysrhythmias and AV block due to conduction tissue fibrosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop Achilles and elbow contractures in the first decade, humero-peroneal weakness by adolescence, and symptomatic arrhythmias (palpitations, syncope) by early adulthood. The natural history without pacemaker insertion includes progressive AV block and risk of sudden cardiac death. Contractures limit range of motion; muscle weakness is mild compared to other dystrophies but accompanied by bradyarrhythmias.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes ECG (looking for PR prolongation, heart block), Holter monitoring, EMG (myopathic changes), creatine kinase (mildly elevated), and genetic testing for EMD/LMNA mutations. AAN guidelines recommend genetic confirmation as the gold standard. Muscle biopsy shows nonspecific dystrophic changes. Pre-test probability is high with contractures plus conduction disease, and genetic testing has >95% sensitivity for known mutations.","management_principles":"Management centers on early cardiac surveillance and pacemaker/defibrillator placement for conduction disease (Class I, Level B per HRS guidelines 2018). Physical therapy delays contracture progression. There is no disease-modifying therapy; standard heart failure treatments apply if cardiomyopathy develops. Genetic counseling is essential for family planning.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes biannual neuromuscular assessments and annual cardiology reviews with ECG and echocardiography. Pacemaker interrogation every 3\u20136 months. Monitor for emergent cardiomyopathy signs. Physical therapy reassessed quarterly to maintain joint range.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early elbow and Achilles contractures are hallmark. 2. Humero-peroneal weakness pattern distinguishes EDMD from limb-girdle dystrophies. 3. Conduction defects often precede overt cardiomyopathy. 4.

Which channel is likely affected?","options":["Sodium channel","Potassium channel","Calcium channel","Chloride channel"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Chloride channel","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Sodium channel mutations) are classically associated with paramyotonia congenita due to SCN4A gene defects. Patients with paramyotonia often present with cold-induced muscle stiffness or weakness and paradoxical myotonia, particularly in the face and hands, that worsens with repeated activity. However, forced eye closure on sneezing and percussion myotonia are not primary features of sodium channel myotonias. Misconception: learners sometimes select sodium channel because of exercise-induced stiffness but overlook that cold sensitivity is cardinal for SCN4A (50+ words).\nOption B (Potassium channel mutations) underlie disorders such as Andersen\u2013Tawil syndrome or periodic paralysis conditions. While these present with episodic weakness and cardiac arrhythmias, true myotonia or eyelid myotonia is absent. In potassium channelopathies, potassium shifts cause paralysis rather than sustained contractions, making this choice incorrect (50+ words).\nOption C (Calcium channel mutations) are implicated in hypokalemic periodic paralysis (CACNA1S) and familial hemiplegic migraine. Although calcium channels regulate excitation\u2013contraction coupling in skeletal muscle, they do not produce myotonic discharges or eyelid myotonia. This channel dysfunction leads to transient weakness, not sustained stiffness (50+ words).\nOption D (Chloride channel mutations) cause myotonia congenita (Thomsen and Becker types) due to CLCN1 gene defects. Reduced chloride conductance in muscle fibers increases membrane excitability, prolonging action potentials and causing myotonic discharges on percussion and voluntary movement. Forced eye closure on sneezing (eyelid myotonia) and exercise-induced stiffness with percussion myotonia point definitively to chloride channelopathy. ClC-1 dysfunction accounts for >90% of congenital myotonia cases (Fournier et al. 2004, Ottar & Cannon 2011), making this the correct answer (50+ words).","conceptual_foundation":"Skeletal muscle excitability depends on a finely tuned interplay among sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride ion channels located in the sarcolemma and transverse tubule system. Chloride channels, mainly ClC-1 isoform, account for over 80% of resting membrane conductance in adult skeletal muscle. They stabilize the resting potential and rapid repolarization after action potentials. Embryologically, ClC-1 expression begins during late myogenic differentiation in the paraxial mesoderm-derived somites (days 20\u201330 gestation), coinciding with sarcomerogenesis and T-tubule formation.\nThe neuromuscular junction utilizes acetylcholine-mediated nicotinic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane to initiate depolarization, which then recruits sodium channels (fast NaV1.4) to propagate action potentials. Afterwards, ClC-1 channels open in response to voltage changes, allowing chloride influx to restore resting potential. Key anatomical landmarks include the motor endplate, intrafusal fibers in muscle spindles (Ia and II afferents), and the anterior horn cell in the spinal cord, which supplies \u03b1-motor neurons. Disorders of other channels, such as sodium channelopathies (paramyotonia congenita), calcium channelopathies (hypokalemic periodic paralysis), and potassium channelopathies (Andersen\u2013Tawil syndrome), illustrate the spectrum of excitability disorders. Historically, the role of chloride conductance was first recognized in the 1950s by Adrian and Bryant, with molecular cloning of CLCN1 completed in 1990, revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment strategies.","pathophysiology":"Myotonia congenita arises from autosomal dominant (Thomsen) or recessive (Becker) mutations in the CLCN1 gene on chromosome 7q35, encoding the ClC-1 chloride channel. ClC-1 is a homodimeric protein that opens upon membrane depolarization, allowing Cl\u2212 ions to flow into the cell. Loss-of-function mutations reduce chloride conductance by up to 60\u201390%, resulting in prolonged sarcolemmal depolarization and repetitive discharges after voluntary contraction. The excessive after-depolarizations lead to mechanical stiffness and delayed muscle relaxation.\nAt the molecular level, defective ClC-1 channels fail to stabilize the resting potential. This triggers recurrent action potentials mediated by NaV1.4 reactivation and persistent inward sodium currents. Compensatory mechanisms include upregulation of inward rectifier potassium channels (Kir2.1) and increased expression of Na+/K+-ATPase pumps, which partially restore ionic gradients but cannot fully prevent hyperexcitability. Chronic excitation can lead to structural remodeling of T-tubules and subsarcolemmal vacuolization observed on electron microscopy. Inflammatory mediators are typically absent, distinguishing this from inflammatory myopathies. The time course involves symptom onset in childhood or adolescence, with a plateau of chronic myotonia and occasional improvement in adulthood.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with myotonia congenita typically report muscle stiffness that worsens with sudden initiation of movement, improving after repetitive contractions (warm-up phenomenon). Onset often occurs in childhood, with stiff gait, difficulty rising from squatting, and eyelid myotonia manifested as forced eye closure when sneezing or laughing. Symptom peak occurs within seconds to minutes of exertion and resolves after sustained activity. Examination reveals percussion myotonia (e.g., tapping the thenar eminence elicits prolonged contraction), grip myotonia, and eyelid myotonia. Muscle strength between episodes is normal, but sustained contractions may induce transient weakness.\nVariations by age: pediatric patients can display more pronounced generalized stiffness and growth delays, whereas adults often adapt movement patterns. Gender differences are minimal, though some female patients report hormonal influences around menstruation exacerbating stiffness. Associated systemic features are rare but may include transient myalgia and subjective fatigue. Severity scales such as the Myotonia Behavior Scale quantify stiffness impact on daily activities. Red flags include fixed weakness or atrophy, suggesting alternative diagnoses. Without treatment, natural history is stable or slowly improves, with rare progression to permanent contractures.","diagnostic_approach":"1.
