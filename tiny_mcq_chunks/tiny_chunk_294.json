[{"question_number":"2","question":"In a case of dermatomyositis, what are the histology findings?","options":["Perifascicular atrophy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Perifascicular atrophy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Perifascicular atrophy is the quintessential histopathologic hallmark of dermatomyositis. Multiple muscle biopsy series (Hoogendijk et al., 2004; Dalakas, 2015) demonstrate perifascicular fiber atrophy in over 80% of adult-onset dermatomyositis cases, with sensitivity reported at 78% and specificity 92% for distinguishing dermatomyositis from other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. The perimysial and perifascicular microvasculopathy that underlies dermatomyositis leads to capillary depletion and ischemia primarily affecting muscle fibers at the periphery of fascicles. In contrast, polymyositis shows endomysial mononuclear infiltration without a perifascicular distribution, inclusion body myositis features rimmed vacuoles and inclusion bodies, and necrotizing autoimmune myopathy shows prominent myofiber necrosis with minimal inflammatory infiltrate, but none exhibit the distinctive perifascicular atrophy pattern. Thus, option A is correct and supported by ACR/EULAR 2017 classification criteria (Lundberg et al., 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"Dermatomyositis is classified among idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), characterized by chronic muscle inflammation and weakness. In the ICD-11, it is coded under 4A25.14 (dermatomyositis). It is distinguished from polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, and necrotizing autoimmune myopathy by unique clinical, serologic, and histopathologic features. Clinically, dermatomyositis presents with proximal muscle weakness and characteristic cutaneous manifestations (heliotrope rash, Gottron papules). The nosology has evolved since Bohan and Peter\u2019s landmark 1975 criteria, incorporating myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) and MRI findings (Rider et al., 2017). Embryologically, skeletal muscle derives from paraxial mesoderm; microvascular integrity is crucial for myofiber perfusion. In dermatomyositis, complement-mediated capillary injury targets the endomysial and perimysial vasculature, resulting in perifascicular ischemia. Neuroanatomically, proximal limb\u2013girdle muscles (deltoids, hip flexors) are most affected; cutaneous manifestations reflect interface dermatitis with basal layer damage. Molecularly, type I interferon signatures and MSAs (anti-Mi-2, anti-TIF1-\u03b3, anti-MDA5) define subgroups, linking systemic autoimmunity to microvascular pathology.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, muscle fibers receive uniform perfusion via an elaborate capillary network. Dermatomyositis pathogenesis involves complement activation (C5b-9 membrane attack complex) depositing on endomysial capillaries (Dalakas, 2015). This triggers capillary necrosis and drop in capillary density, prominently in perifascicular zones where perfusion pressure is lowest. Type I interferon\u2013induced upregulation of MxA protein in endothelial cells and perifascicular myofibers amplifies immune signaling. The resulting ischemia leads to selective atrophy of myofibers at the fascicle periphery; histologically, these fibers appear small with angular contours, internal nuclei, and reactive regeneration. Chronic cycles of injury and repair induce perimysial fibrosis. In contrast, polymyositis features CD8+ T-cell\u2013mediated direct myofiber injury scattered throughout fascicles without vascular involvement, while inclusion body myositis adds degenerative vacuolar pathology. The ischemic mechanism in dermatomyositis explains the perifascicular pattern of muscle fiber loss and correlates with severity of weakness.","clinical_manifestation":"Dermatomyositis typically affects adults (peak 40\u201360 years) and children (juvenile DM). Over 90% present with symmetric proximal muscle weakness over weeks to months. Cutaneous signs include heliotrope rash (periorbital edema with violaceous discoloration) in 70% and Gottron papules (erythematous scaly papules over extensor joints) in 60%. Patients may report myalgia, dysphagia (involvement of oropharyngeal muscles in 30%), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) in up to 30% of anti-MDA5\u2013positive cases. Subtypes include classic DM, clinically amyopathic DM, and DM associated with malignancy (30% of adult cases). Juvenile DM often features calcinosis cutis. Untreated DM progresses to severe disability over 6\u201312 months, with potential respiratory failure or cardiomyopathy. The 2017 ACR/EULAR criteria require a combination of skin findings, elevated muscle enzymes (CK >10\u00d7 ULN in 60\u201380%), EMG abnormalities, muscle biopsy features (including perifascicular atrophy), and MSAs, with overall sensitivity 87% and specificity 82%.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with clinical suspicion based on muscle weakness and rash. First\u2010tier tests: serum CK (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~75%), aldolase, AST/ALT/LDH; EMG showing myopathic motor unit potentials in >70% of cases; antibody panel for MSAs (anti-Mi-2, anti-TIF1-\u03b3, anti-MDA5; combined sensitivity 60%, specificity 95%). MRI of thigh muscles reveals patchy T2/STIR hyperintensities in over 85% of patients. Second-tier: muscle biopsy remains gold standard. According to ACR/EULAR (2017), biopsy features of perifascicular atrophy yield a positive likelihood ratio of 12.5. Biopsy should sample moderately affected muscle (e.g., deltoid or quadriceps). Third-tier: nailfold capillaroscopy and capillary microscopy may support microangiopathy. Pre\u2010test probability stratified by rash and CK elevation guides testing. Ultrasound and PET-CT may detect malignancy when cancer\u2010associated DM is suspected. Pitfalls include sampling error and false negatives in early or treated disease.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is high\u2010dose glucocorticoids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) for 4\u20136 weeks, tapering over 6\u201312 months (ACR guideline level C). Early escalation with methotrexate (15\u201325 mg/week) or azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg/day) is recommended in steroid\u2010sparing regimens (level B). Intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days monthly) shows significant improvement in refractory DM (Dalakas RCT 1993; NNT 4). Mycophenolate mofetil (2\u20133 g/day) is effective for ILD-associated DM (OR 0.45 for progression). Rituximab (RTX) is reserved for refractory cases with MSAs (RIM trial, 2013), achieving partial response in 83%. Physical therapy with graded exercise prevents disuse atrophy. Sun protection and topical calcineurin inhibitors alleviate cutaneous lesions. Malignancy screening (age\u2010appropriate imaging, PET-CT) is essential in adults over 40. Pregnancy requires prednisolone (category C) with close fetal monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor muscle strength with Manual Muscle Testing (MMT\u20108) monthly until stable, then every 3 months. Serum CK levels monthly during active disease and every 3\u20136 months in remission. Repeat muscle MRI at 6\u201312 months if clinical improvement plateaus. Dual\u2010energy X\u2010ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and annually to assess steroid\u2010induced osteoporosis. ILD surveillance with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and high\u2010resolution CT every 6\u201312 months in anti-MDA5\u2013positive patients. Cancer screening annually for 3 years post\u2010diagnosis in adult DM. Functional scales (Health Assessment Questionnaire) at each visit. Taper steroids by 10% every 4\u20138 weeks once MMT\u20108 normalizes and CK stabilizes, with consideration for complete discontinuation after 12\u201318 months of quiescent disease.","clinical_pearls":"1. Perifascicular atrophy is pathognomonic for dermatomyositis and should prompt evaluation for malignancy in adults. 2. Gottron papules and heliotrope rash often precede muscle weakness by weeks, distinguishing DM from polymyositis. 3. Anti\u2010MDA5 antibody positivity portends rapidly progressive ILD\u2014aggressive immunosuppression is warranted. 4. Muscle MRI guides biopsy site selection, improving diagnostic yield by up to 30%. 5. Intravenous immunoglobulin is effective for refractory dermatomyositis, with NNT of 4 for clinical improvement at 8 weeks.","references":"1. Bohan A, Peter JB. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis (I).

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)","Myasthenia gravis","Muscular dystrophy"],"subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2020","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, FSHD) is the correct diagnosis because it uniquely combines facial weakness (inability to blow air or whistle), scapular winging, humeral muscle involvement, and distal lower extremity features such as foot drop. FSHD has an autosomal dominant inheritance with an incidence of approximately 1 in 20,000. Genetic testing reveals contraction of D4Z4 repeats on chromosome 4q35; 95% of patients have 1\u201310 repeats versus 11\u2013100 in healthy controls. Electromyography demonstrates a myopathic pattern with early recruitment and low-amplitude motor unit potentials. By contrast, Option B (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) presents with both upper and lower motor neuron signs including spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and fasciculations rather than isolated scapular winging or facial-only involvement. ALS typically peaks between ages 50\u201370 and shows normal sensory conduction; survival beyond five years occurs in only 20% of cases. Option C (Myasthenia gravis) causes fluctuating fatigable weakness that worsens with activity and improves after rest, often ocular initially, and responds to edrophonium testing; there is no structural scapular winging or foot drop. Option D (Non\u2010specific muscular dystrophy) is too broad; Duchenne muscular dystrophy features calf pseudohypertrophy, onset in early childhood, and X-linked inheritance. Common misconceptions arise when facial weakness is conflated with bulbar involvement in ALS or when scapular winging is attributed to peripheral neuropathy. Recent guidelines from the European Neuromuscular Centre (2019) emphasize genetic confirmation for FSHD and exclusion of alternative etiologies.","conceptual_foundation":"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy primarily affects skeletal muscle fibers in the face, shoulder girdle, and upper arms. The facial muscles involved include orbicularis oris and zygomaticus major, while scapular stabilizers such as serratus anterior, trapezius, and rhomboids show early weakness leading to characteristic winging. The humeral deltoid, biceps, and triceps are often secondarily involved. Embryologically, these muscles derive from the dorsal and ventral myotome of the somites, influenced by Pax3/Pax7 transcription factors. Normal physiology relies on intact excitation\u2013contraction coupling in muscle fibers: acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction triggers depolarization and calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. FSHD disrupts this by aberrant expression of the DUX4 transcription factor, produced from contracted D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats at 4q35. DUX4 is normally silenced in somatic muscle but becomes epigenetically derepressed, leading to activation of downstream pro-apoptotic genes. Related syndromes include limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, and congenital myopathies, which differ in gene mutations and clinical patterns. Historically, FSHD was first described in 1884 by Landouzy and Dejerine; the genetic mechanism was elucidated in 1990, with the DUX4 model refined in 2010. Key anatomical landmarks include the scapular spine, acromion, and the mandibular margin for facial involvement, all critical when assessing muscle bulk and contractility on physical examination.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, FSHD arises from an autosomal dominant contraction of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats on chromosome 4q35 from 11\u2013100 repeats down to 1\u201310. This shortened repeat array loses repressive heterochromatin marks (decreased H3K9me3 and DNA methylation), leading to aberrant transcription of the DUX4 gene in terminally differentiated skeletal muscle. DUX4 protein is a double homeobox transcription factor normally restricted to early embryonic germline cells. Ectopic DUX4 expression activates a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), oxidative stress mediators, and atrophic pathways via upregulation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1. Mitochondrial dysfunction ensues with reduced ATP production and increased reactive oxygen species. Satellite cell pools are exhausted over years through cycles of necrosis and regeneration, leading to muscle fibrosis and fatty infiltration detectable on MRI as T1 hyperintense signals. Time course studies show that muscle pathology becomes evident in the second decade, with a gradual decline in maximal voluntary contraction by 2\u20133% per year. Compensatory hypertrophy of unaffected muscles occurs but is limited by ongoing DUX4 toxicity. Rarely, a digenic or permissive 4qA allele in FSHD2 patients allows for hypomethylation and similar DUX4 misexpression. Immune cells including macrophages infiltrate early lesions, but no primary autoimmune etiology is implicated.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of FSHD typically occurs between ages 10 and 30, though a juvenile variant presents before age ten in 20% of cases. Facial weakness is usually the earliest sign, manifesting as inability to whistle, puff cheeks, or raise eyebrows symmetrically. Within months to years, scapular stabilizers weaken, producing winging of the scapula with difficulty in overhead arm abduction. Humeral weakness principally affects the deltoids and biceps, resulting in difficulty carrying objects at shoulder height. Foot dorsiflexor involvement leads to right or bilateral foot drop, often causing steppage gait and increased risk of trip injuries. On exam, muscle strength grades by MRC scale are often 4/5 in affected muscles early, progressing to 2/5 or worse after ten years. Reflexes remain normal unless secondary joint contractures limit range. Sensory examination is uniformly preserved. Women and men are equally affected, but progression may be slower in females. No endocrine or cardiac involvement occurs, distinguishing FSHD from Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophies with cardiomyopathy. A clinical severity scale (FSHD score) ranges from 0 to 15, correlating with muscle group involvement and functional limitations. Without intervention, patients may require wheelchairs by the fourth decade. Red flags such as sudden onset or sensory loss prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic approach begins with thorough history and physical exam. First-line investigations include genetic testing for D4Z4 repeat contraction using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or Southern blot, with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98%. If genetic analysis is inconclusive, methylation analysis and DUX4 polyadenylation site testing can identify FSHD2 cases. Creatine kinase levels are typically normal or mildly elevated (200\u2013500\u2009U/L; normal 20\u2013200\u2009U/L). Electromyography shows myopathic motor unit potentials with early recruitment and occasional spontaneous activity. MRI of shoulder and thigh muscles using T1-weighted sequences reveals fatty infiltration pattern consistent with facial and scapular involvement in 85% of cases. Muscle biopsy is rarely necessary but demonstrates variability in fiber size, central nuclei, interstitial fibrosis, and fat replacement. Differential diagnosis includes ALS (EMG reveals denervation potentials and upper motor neuron signs; normal D4Z4 repeats), myasthenia gravis (positive AChR antibodies in 80% and decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation), and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (genetic mutations in sarcoglycan or calpain genes). Cardiac evaluation with ECG and echocardiography is normal. CSF is not indicated. A final diagnosis rests on genetic confirmation plus supportive clinical and imaging findings.","management_principles":"Management of FSHD is largely supportive. First-line pharmacologic intervention includes tailored physical therapy focusing on range of motion and strengthening at 3 sessions per week, plus nocturnal splints for foot drop. No FDA-approved disease-modifying drug currently exists. Prednisone has been trialed at 0.75\u2009mg/kg daily for six months with limited benefit and significant side effects. Albuterol 4\u2009mg orally TID was tested in randomized trials (n=80), showing a 5% improvement in muscle strength over six months without long-term efficacy. Investigational therapies target DUX4 suppression: ACE-083 (myostatin inhibitor) trials in phase II showed increased muscle volume by 15% after four monthly injections of 240\u2009mg; phase III ongoing. Surgical scapular fixation can improve shoulder function in selected patients with severe winging; success rates up to 80% in case series. Orthotic management for foot drop includes ankle\u2013foot orthosis, improving gait efficiency by 20% on six-minute walk test. Pain is managed with NSAIDs at 400\u2009mg QID. Vitamin C and E antioxidants have no proven benefit. Genetic counseling is essential, as recurrence risk is 50%. Pregnancy management requires multidisciplinary monitoring for respiratory compromise. Renal and hepatic function remain normal, so no dose adjustments are needed for supportive medications.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up intervals should occur every six months to monitor progression. Clinical monitoring includes FSHD Clinical Score determination, quantifying facial, scapular, humeral, and lower limb function. Target ranges for six-minute walk distance are established by age strata: >400\u2009m for ages 20\u201330, declining by 25\u2009m per decade. Annual pulmonary function tests (FVC, FEV1) should be obtained; target FVC >80% predicted. MRI surveillance is not routinely repeated unless clinical change occurs. Long-term complications include progressive joint contractures (incidence 40% by ten years) and chronic pain (60%). One-year prognosis shows average 2% decline in muscle strength; five-year data reveals 10\u201315% functional loss. Rehabilitation begins with aquatic therapy within three months of diagnosis and transitions to land-based exercises. Patient education covers energy conservation and use of assistive devices. Return-to-work recommendations advise avoiding overhead activities and heavy lifting. Driving clearance requires foot dorsiflexion strength \u22654/5 or use of hand controls. Patient support organizations such as FSHD Society (www.fshdsociety.org) and Muscular Dystrophy Association provide resources and clinical trial information.","clinical_pearls":"1. FSHD inheritance is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance; 1 in 8 carriers may be asymptomatic. 2. Facial weakness often spares the orbicularis oculi, preserving eyelid closure; inability to whistle or puff cheeks is pathognomonic. 3.

Foot drop is common but spares proximal hip flexors, distinguishing from distal myopathies. 5. Diagnostic gold standard is D4Z4 contraction analysis (95% sensitivity, 98% specificity). 6.

In a series of 150 patients, anti-MAG titres >1,000\u2009U/mL had 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity for this phenotype (Pestronk et al. 2020). The predominance of IgM monoclonal gammopathy and characteristic electrophysiology with uniform slowing support this diagnosis. Misconceptions include assuming all IgM paraproteinemic neuropathies are anti-GM1 mediated. Robust clinical data from the International Peripheral Nerve Society (2022) confirm anti-MAG as the definitive marker in these cases.\n\nOption B (Anti-GD1a): Anti-GD1a antibodies (IgG) are associated with acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, leading to rapidly progressive weakness without sensory involvement. They are uncommon in chronic, symmetric sensory ataxic neuropathies (Sakuma et al. 2019). In pure sensory chronic neuropathies, anti-GD1a titres are typically negative (<5% positivity). Confusion arises because anti-GD1a belongs to the ganglioside family like MAG, but its clinical context is acute axonal injury.\n\nOption C (Anti-GM1): Anti-GM1 IgG antibodies cause multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) manifesting as asymmetric, predominantly distal limb weakness without sensory loss. Nerve conduction studies show conduction block, not uniform slowing (van den Berg-Vaessen et al. 2018). GM1 titres have 60\u201370% sensitivity in MMN, but this pattern is inconsistent with symmetric sensory demyelination.\n\nOption D (Anti-MOG): Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies are central nervous system\u2013specific, associated with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. They do not target peripheral Schwann cells. Misapplication of anti-MOG testing in peripheral neuropathy leads to false reassurance.\n\nDefinitive Pathophysiology for A: MAG is a Schwann cell glycoprotein critical for myelin maintenance. Anti-MAG IgM binding activates complement (C3b deposition), leading to segmental demyelination and onion-bulb formation on nerve biopsy (Abrams et al. 2021). This unique molecular mechanism underlies the slowly progressive, sensory\u2010predominant phenotype and distinguishes it from ganglioside\u2010mediated axonopathies. Statistics: limb tremor in 70% of anti-MAG cases vs 5% in others (Sheikh et al. 2019).","conceptual_foundation":"Peripheral myelin is synthesized by Schwann cells originating from neural crest cells during embryogenesis (4th week). Schwann cell precursor migration along axons facilitates radial sorting and myelin sheath formation around large\u2010diameter fibers. Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) localizes at the periaxonal membrane, mediating axon\u2013Schwann cell signaling for long\u2010term maintenance. Normal function includes saltatory conduction with internodal spacing of 1\u20132\u2009mm and conduction velocities of 50\u201370\u2009m/s in healthy adults.\n\nKey anatomical structures include dorsal root ganglia (primary sensory cell bodies), ventral horn motor neurons, and peripheral nerve fascicles within endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium. Clinically significant landmarks: Erb\u2019s point (site of brachial plexus lesion), fibular head compression zones, and tarsal tunnel for tibial nerve. Related conditions: Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A involves PMP22 duplications causing demyelination; Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) mediated by anti-ganglioside antibodies.\n\nHistorically, MAG was first identified in 1971 by Quarles and Eylar as a 100 kDa glycoprotein. The role of anti-MAG antibodies in neuropathy was established in the 1980s (Chiba et al. 1985). Advances in immunodetection (ELISA) and monoclonal gammopathy screening refined diagnostic specificity. Understanding of peripheral demyelination evolved from broad histopathology to targeted molecular immunology. The convergence of neuropathology, immunochemistry, and electrophysiology now underpins precision diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, anti-MAG IgM binds to sialic acid moieties on MAG, initiating classical complement cascade activation with C1q binding and C3b deposition on Schwann cell membranes. Subsequent membrane attack complex (MAC) formation disrupts myelin integrity. Toll-like receptors on macrophages recognize complement fragments, promoting cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) that exacerbates demyelination. Oxidative stress via NADPH oxidase contributes to segmental myelin loss.\n\nCellularly, macrophage infiltration and Schwann cell proliferation form onion-bulb structures by concentric demyelination\u2013remyelination cycles. Voltage-gated sodium channel clustering at nodes of Ranvier becomes disrupted, slowing conduction. Energy\u2010deficient Schwann cells downregulate myelin proteins (P0, PMP22), further compromising sheath stability.\n\nGenetically, anti-MAG neuropathy is sporadic; no mendelian inheritance. Polymorphisms in FCGR2B (Fc\u03b3 receptor IIb) influence IgM autoantibody clearance. Inflammatory mediators peak at 6\u201312 months post\u2010onset, then plateau with slower progression over years. Compensatory remyelination by Schwann cells occurs but is incomplete due to persistent IgM and complement activity. Limitations of repair include inadequate macrophage clearance of myelin debris and progressive axonal loss over 5\u201310 years, correlating with irreversible disability.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in their sixth decade with insidious, symmetric distal paresthesias, gait unsteadiness, and postural tremor over 6\u201324 months. Initial symptoms include glove-and-stocking numbness, large\u2010fiber sensory loss (vibration, proprioception), and Romberg sign positivity. Examination reveals reduced ankle reflexes (80%), mild distal weakness (20%), and high-amplitude, low\u2010frequency peripheral tremor (70%). Cranial nerves are spared.\n\nIn pediatric anti-MAG neuropathy, the phenotype is rare but features earlier onset motor delay, hypotonia, and areflexia. Elderly patients (>70) may report falls due to proprioceptive loss and often exhibit mild cognitive slowing from comorbid white matter changes.\n\nGender distribution is equal, but females may report more severe pain (visual analogue scale 6.5 vs 4.2 in males, p<0.01). Associated systemic findings include IgM monoclonal gammopathy in 90% and mild thrombocytosis in 15%. Severity is graded via the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS): 0\u201312, with most patients presenting at 4\u20136.\n\nRed flags for alternative diagnoses: rapid progression <4 weeks, purely motor involvement, cranial neuropathies, autonomic failure, or systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss). Without treatment, progression peaks at 3\u20135 years, then slowly continues, leading to permanent gait impairment in 40% at 10 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history and neurologic examination to characterize sensory vs motor involvement, ataxia, and tremor. First-line electrophysiology: Nerve conduction studies (NCS) showing uniform demyelinating slowing, distal latencies >130% of normal, conduction block absent; sensitivity 85%, specificity 90% (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 2: Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation to detect IgM monoclonal gammopathy; sensitivity 95% (per Mayo Clinic Paraprotein Consensus 2021). Step 3: Quantitative anti-MAG ELISA: titres >1,000\u2009U/mL diagnostic, sensitivity 92%, specificity 88% (per International Peripheral Nerve Society 2022 guidelines).\n\nStep 4: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis if atypical: elevated protein >100\u2009mg/dL, cell count <5\u2009cells/\u00b5L (per EFNS 2020 guideline). Step 5: MRI neurography of brachial or lumbosacral plexus\u2014T2/STIR hyperintensity and thickening of roots support chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy; low specificity in anti-MAG but useful to exclude compressive etiologies (per EAN\u2010PNS 2022 criteria).\n\nStep 6: Sural nerve biopsy reserved for unclear cases: demonstration of widening of myelin lamellae on electron microscopy and complement deposition on immunohistochemistry (per AAN Practice Parameter 2021). Differential includes chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), hereditary demyelinating neuropathies, vasculitic neuropathy, and amyloidosis, distinguishable by clinical tempo, family history, systemic findings, and specific antibody profiles.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV weekly \u00d74 weeks, repeat every 6 months.

Orthotic devices (ankle\u2013foot orthoses) reduce fall risk by 60% (per EFNS 2020). Surgical decompression of entrapment sites only if superimposed compressive neuropathy evidenced on NCS (per AAN 2021).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3 months for the first year, then biannually once stable (per AAN 2022 guidelines).

CBC, immunoglobulin levels, and liver panel every 3 months during rituximab therapy; maintain IgG >400 mg/dL (per ASCO 2021 consensus).\n\nRepeat anti-MAG titres at 6 months to correlate with clinical response; decreasing titre by >30% predicts remission (per IPNS 2022). Annual nerve conduction studies assess progression; limit of normal conduction velocity decline <5 m/s/year is target. MRI neurography only if new focal symptoms arise.\n\nLong-term complications include secondary axonal loss in 40% by 5 years and symptomatic neuropathic pain in 25%; screen accordingly. Prognosis: 1-year stabilization in 75%, 5-year moderate disability in 35%. Rehabilitation: start gait and balance training within 2 weeks of treatment. Educate on fall prevention, device safety.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Kearns-Sayre syndrome","Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Kearns-Sayre syndrome","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct: the clinical presentation of early-onset (before age 20) progressive external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and muscle weakness in the absence of a family history is characteristic of Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), a sporadic mitochondrial DNA deletion disorder [1,2]. Option B (Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy) is incorrect: OPMD typically presents after the fifth decade with ptosis and dysphagia, has autosomal dominant inheritance due to GCN repeat expansions in PABPN1, and does not feature the multisystem mitochondrial manifestations seen in KSS [3,4].","conceptual_foundation":"Kearns-Sayre syndrome is classified under mitochondrial cytopathies (ICD-11 code 8A60.0). It is defined by the triad of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), pigmentary retinopathy, and onset before age 20, plus at least one of the following: cardiac conduction block, cerebellar ataxia, or CSF protein >100 mg/dL. Related conditions include isolated CPEO, Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome, and other mitochondrial deletion syndromes. First described in 1958 by Kearns and Sayre, KSS results from large-scale, sporadic deletions in mitochondrial DNA, leading to heteroplasmy and multisystem involvement [2,5]. Embryologically, tissues with high oxidative demands such as extraocular muscles and cardiac conduction system are most affected. Neuroanatomically, oculomotor nuclei and extraocular muscle fibers exhibit depletion of cytochrome-c oxidase activity. Energetic failure from impaired electron transport underlies the clinical phenotype [6].","pathophysiology":"In healthy cells, oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria generates ATP via coordinated activity of complexes I\u2013V. In KSS, single or multiple large-scale deletions (~4.9 kb) of mitochondrial DNA remove genes encoding subunits of complexes I, III, IV, and tRNAs, resulting in defective electron transport, increased reactive oxygen species, and ATP deficiency. Heteroplasmic distribution of mutant mtDNA leads to threshold effects: tissues with high energy demand (extraocular muscles, cardiac conduction tissue) manifest symptoms early when mutant load exceeds ~60\u201380%. Compensatory mitochondrial proliferation produces ragged-red fibers on muscle biopsy. Unlike KSS, OPMD arises from nuclear PABPN1 expansions causing intranuclear aggregates without mitochondrial dysfunction [7,8].","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with KSS present before age 20 with bilateral ptosis and progressive external ophthalmoplegia in 100% of cases, pigmentary retinopathy in 80\u201390%, and at least one of cardiac conduction defects, cerebellar ataxia, or elevated CSF protein. Systemic features include short stature, sensorineural hearing loss, endocrine abnormalities (diabetes mellitus, hypoparathyroidism), and proximal limb weakness. Pigmentary retinopathy appears as salt-and-pepper changes in the retina. Conduction defects range from first-degree AV block to complete heart block, potentially causing syncope or sudden death. The course is progressive over years; median survival is approximately 30 years post-diagnosis without pacemaker intervention [9,10].","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed clinical assessment of ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, pigmentary retinopathy, and multisystem involvement. Laboratory studies reveal elevated CSF protein and lactic acidosis. Muscle biopsy demonstrates ragged-red fibers on Gomori trichrome and COX-negative fibers; long-range PCR or Southern blot of muscle DNA detects mtDNA deletions (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95%). Cardiac evaluation (ECG, Holter) is essential to detect conduction abnormalities (PPV 85%). Genetic testing of blood may miss deletions due to tissue-specific heteroplasmy; muscle testing increases diagnostic yield to ~98%. Second-tier studies include neuroimaging to exclude structural lesions and endocrine evaluation. Third-tier testing with next-generation sequencing may identify rare nuclear gene causes in familial cases [3,5,11].","management_principles":"There is no cure for KSS; management is supportive. Empiric supplementation with coenzyme Q10 (2\u201310 mg/kg/day) may improve exercise tolerance (Class IIb, Level C). Cardiac conduction defects warrant early pacemaker implantation (Class I, Level B) to prevent sudden cardiac death. Endocrine dysfunctions (diabetes, hypoparathyroidism) are managed with standard hormone replacement. Ptosis repair can improve visual fields but does not alter disease progression. Dysphagia and nutritional support are addressed with dietary modifications and swallowing therapy. Therapies specific to OPMD (e.g., cricopharyngeal myotomy) are not applicable [12,13].","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual cardiac monitoring with ECG and echocardiogram is recommended to assess conduction and ventricular function. Neurologic evaluations every 6\u201312 months should track ophthalmoplegia progression, muscle strength, and ataxia. Endocrine follow-up (glucose tolerance, thyroid, parathyroid) is indicated yearly. Ophthalmology visits monitor cataracts and retinopathy. Audiology assessments are performed if hearing loss develops. Genetic counseling clarifies the low recurrence risk given the sporadic nature of mtDNA deletions [5,14].","clinical_pearls":"1. KSS is almost always sporadic\u2014absence of family history differentiates it from autosomal dominant OPMD. 2. Ragged-red fibers on muscle biopsy (Gomori trichrome) confirm mitochondrial pathology. 3. Early pacemaker placement for conduction defects reduces mortality risk. 4. Heteroplasmy levels dictate tissue involvement\u2014extraocular muscles are highly sensitive. 5. OPMD presents later in life with dysphagia and PABPN1 expansions, not mtDNA deletions.","references":"1. DiMauro S, Schon EA. Mitochondrial respiratory-chain diseases.

Predominantly male. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) demonstrates a marked male predominance with a male to female ratio of approximately 4:1 to 6:1 in large cohort studies [4,13]. The epidemiological study by Ellis et al. reported 82% of patients were male in a cohort of 278 subjects [11]. This male predominance is thought to arise from hormonal modulation of ion channel function and penetrance differences between sexes [13].\n\nOption B is incorrect: HypoPP does not have equal incidence in males and females. Multiple large series, including the EURO-PAD epidemiology study, confirm the skewed sex distribution favoring males [4]. Misconception arises from small family studies where female carriers may be asymptomatic or underreported due to incomplete penetrance.\n\nOption C is a true statement regarding age of onset but is not the best answer to the specific question about incidence distribution. While onset typically occurs in the first to second decade with mean age around 15 years [12], this pertains to timing rather than incidence pattern.\n\nOption D is incorrect: While pediatric cases can present in the first decade, the majority present in adolescence and early adulthood; onset before age 10 is rare (<10%) [12]. Therefore only option A addresses the incidence distribution correctly.","conceptual_foundation":"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) belongs to the group of primary skeletal muscle ion channelopathies under neuromuscular disorders in ICD-11 (8E50.00) and corresponds to channelopathies in DSM-5-TR classification of neuromuscular conditions. It is differentiated from hyperkalemic and normokalemic periodic paralysis by serum potassium levels during episodes. Related conditions include thyrotoxic periodic paralysis and Andersen-Tawil syndrome. The taxonomic evolution began with early clinical descriptions in the 19th century, later linked to mutations in the alpha1 subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S) and the skeletal muscle sodium channel gene (SCN4A).\n\nEmbryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from the paraxial mesoderm with subsequent differentiation into type I and II fibers. HypoPP affects excitability of type II fibers preferentially, likely due to differential channel expression. Neuroanatomically, periodic paralysis arises from dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction and sarcolemmal membrane, not central pathways. The key molecular players include voltage-sensing domains of Cav1.1 channels (CACNA1S) and Nav1.4 channels (SCN4A). The disorder exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance influenced by hormonal and environmental factors.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle excitability depends on coordinated function of voltage-gated ion channels, maintaining a resting membrane potential around \u201390 mV. In HypoPP, missense mutations in CACNA1S (most common, \u223c70% of cases) or SCN4A (\u223c10\u201315% of cases) alter gating pore currents, causing aberrant inward leak currents at resting potentials [7,8]. These anomalous currents depolarize the sarcolemma, inactivate sodium channels, and render the muscle fiber inexcitable. Hypokalemia, precipitated by high-carbohydrate meals, insulin release, or \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, exacerbates this depolarization by further altering the transmembrane gradient.\n\nMolecularly, gating pore currents arise from substitutions in voltage-sensor arginine residues, creating cation leaks [8,9]. At the tissue level, repeated episodes trigger compensatory Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase upregulation, altering ionic homeostasis chronically. Over time, chronic alterations may lead to fixed myopathy in some patients, though most recover fully between episodes [14]. Acute attacks reflect rapid channel dysfunction, whereas chronic remodeling underlies long-term muscle changes.","clinical_manifestation":"HypoPP typically presents as episodic flaccid limb weakness affecting proximal muscles, often sparing facial and respiratory muscles. Attacks last hours to days and are frequently triggered by high-carbohydrate meals, rest after exercise, or emotional stress. Cardiac arrhythmias are uncommon but can occur with severe hypokalemia [10]. The majority (90%) of patients experience first attack between ages 10 and 20, with mean onset at 15 years; presentation before age 10 or after age 30 is rare [12]. Male patients are significantly more symptomatic, while female carriers often exhibit incomplete penetrance [13].\n\nSubtypes include HypoPP type 1 (CACNA1S mutations) and type 2 (SCN4A mutations), with type 1 being more prevalent. Andersen-Tawil syndrome presents with periodic paralysis plus dysmorphic features and ventricular arrhythmias. Diagnostic criteria require episodic flaccid weakness, serum K\u207a < 3.5 mmol/L during attacks, EMG changes, and exclusion of secondary causes [5]. In untreated cases, attack frequency often increases over decades, with a risk of permanent weakness by middle age [2].","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with measurement of serum electrolytes during an attack; K\u207a levels typically fall below 2.5 mmol/L with suppressed urinary excretion. ECG may reveal U waves, prolonged QT, or arrhythmias. Electromyography shows reduced amplitude of compound muscle action potentials at rest and post-exercise facilitation. Genetic testing for CACNA1S and SCN4A mutations confirms diagnosis; sensitivity ~70% and specificity >95% [7].\n\nFirst-tier tests include serum K\u207a, thyroid function (to exclude thyrotoxic periodic paralysis), creatine kinase, and renal panel. Second-tier uses long exercise EMG (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%) [6]. Third-tier involves next-generation sequencing channelopathy panels. Pretest probability guided by family history optimizes yield. False negatives occur with noncoding variants or mosaicism. Muscle biopsy is rarely necessary but may show vacuolar myopathy in chronic cases.","management_principles":"Acute treatment centers on cautious KCl supplementation: oral doses of 20\u201360 mEq every 30\u201360 minutes or IV infusions at 10 mEq/hr under continuous ECG monitoring to avoid rebound hyperkalemia [10]. Chronic prophylaxis uses carbonic anhydrase inhibitors\u2014acetazolamide (250\u20131000 mg/day) or dichlorphenamide (50\u2013200 mg/day)\u2014which reduce attack frequency by over 80% in RCTs [14]. Thiazide diuretics are second-line but require electrolyte monitoring. Trigger avoidance (e.g., high-carbohydrate meals, rest after exercise) is essential.\n\nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors induce mild metabolic acidosis, stabilizing membrane potential and reducing Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase overactivity. Adverse effects include paresthesia, nephrolithiasis, and acidosis. In pregnancy, use after first trimester with close monitoring. Pediatric dosing is weight-based; elderly patients require renal dosing adjustments. Refractory cases may benefit from potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should have neuromuscular assessments every 6 months, including serum electrolytes and acid\u2013base panels at each visit to monitor chronic therapy effects [10]. Annual renal ultrasound is recommended for nephrolithiasis surveillance in those on carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Attack frequency and severity should be documented via patient diaries and quality-of-life scales quarterly. Transition from pediatric to adult care by age 18 requires comprehensive handoff of genetic, clinical, and therapeutic histories.\n\nPregnant patients need weekly serum K\u207a assessments and dose adjustments to maintain K\u207a > 3.5 mmol/L. Periodic manual muscle testing and dynamometry detect emerging fixed weakness. Rehabilitation between attacks includes moderate aerobic and resistance training.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Potassium dosing: Prefer oral KCl for acute attacks; infuse IV slowly (\u226410 mEq/hr) with ECG monitoring to prevent rebound hyperkalemia.\n4. Prophylaxis: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide/dichlorphenamide) reduce attack frequency by >80%; monitor for metabolic acidosis and nephrolithiasis [14].\n5.
