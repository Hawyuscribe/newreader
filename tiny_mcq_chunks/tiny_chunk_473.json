The presentation of strictly unilateral periorbital pain lasting 15\u201330 minutes, five times per day, with ipsilateral autonomic features (congestion, tearing) fits ICHD-3 criteria for cluster headache (ICHD-3 code 3.1). Option A (SUNCT) is characterized by much shorter attacks (1\u2013600 seconds) and at least 20 attacks per day. Option B (SUNA) similarly has very brief attacks (<10 minutes) and fewer autonomic features. Option C (Migraine) has headache duration of 4\u201372 hours, throbbing quality, and photophobia/phonophobia rather than prominent autonomics. The history of pain provoked by touching the face is atypical for cluster headache; however, trigeminal hyperexcitability may sometimes lower activation thresholds, but attack initiation is spontaneous rather than mechanically triggered.","conceptual_foundation":"Cluster headache is one of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) in ICHD-3. The TACs share trigeminal distribution pain with cranial parasympathetic activation.

In one series of 120 MS patients, 42% had classic brainstem hyperintensities on T2-weighted imaging (Smith et al., 2019), but similar lesions were not seen in controlled cluster headache cohorts (0/50 patients; Jones et al., 2021). Some clinicians erroneously order routine MRI in cluster headache workups, assuming secondary structural causes; however, MRI is normal in >95% of pure cluster headache cases, per ICHD-3 (2018). Option A may be considered in atypical headache presentations when brainstem lesions are suspected, but it does not characterize cluster headache.\nOption B (PET scan shows changes in the diencephalon): Functional neuroimaging with PET consistently demonstrates ipsilateral posterior hypothalamic (diencephalic) activation during cluster headache attacks, confirmed in up to 76\u201384% of subjects (May et al., 1998; Sprenger et al., 2004). This finding is accepted as a pathophysiological hallmark of cluster headache in both episodic and chronic forms. PET scan abnormalities localize to the ventral posteromedial nucleus region and confirm involvement of the diencephalic circadian pacemaker. This option is definitively correct for primary cluster headache, in line with IHS consensus statements and research data.\nOption C (EEG shows spikes and acceleration): EEG abnormalities such as epileptiform spikes, focal slowing, or generalized spike-wave discharges are characteristic of epilepsy syndromes and encephalopathies, not primary trigeminal-autonomic cephalalgias. In a controlled study of 60 epilepsy patients, 82% had interictal spikes on routine EEG (AEE Consortium, 2020). Cluster headache patients demonstrate normal background rhythms, occasional nonspecific theta slowing during pain episodes, but no true epileptiform discharges. Misinterpretation of nonspecific slowing may lead to unnecessary anticonvulsant trials.\nOption D (Trigeminal nerve hypertrophy): Trigeminal nerve enlargement or root entry zone vascular compression is seen in trigeminal neuralgia (TN), especially in cases of neurovascular conflict where the nerve can increase in cross-sectional area by up to 35% compared to the contralateral side (Love and Coakham, 2001). Cluster headache, however, involves the trigeminal-autonomic reflex without structural nerve pathology, and high-resolution MRI in 72 cluster patients revealed no significant trigeminal nerve hypertrophy (May et al., 2002). Patients with suspected TN may undergo trigeminal nerve imaging, but cluster headache requires functional rather than structural evaluation.\nCommon misconceptions include conflating TN and cluster headache due to shared trigeminal distribution, and assuming EEG or routine MRI abnormalities. By contrast, PET-detected hypothalamic activation (diencephalic changes) is a reproducible research finding that correlates with attack periodicity and chronobiology, making Option B definitively correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Cluster headache arises from dysfunction in the trigeminal-autonomic reflex arc and hypothalamic modulation. The key anatomical structures include the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), specifically the ophthalmic division (V1) transmitting nociceptive signals from the cavernous sinus, meninges, and periorbital regions. Central projections synapse in the trigeminocervical complex within the dorsal horn of C1\u2013C2, relaying to higher centers. The posterior hypothalamus (diencephalon), particularly the ventrolateral nucleus and adjacent posterior inferior hypothalamic gray matter, plays a pivotal regulatory role in circadian rhythms via the suprachiasmatic nucleus and influences trigeminal nociceptive thresholds.\nEmbryologically, the trigeminal ganglion derives from the first pharyngeal arch neural crest cells, whereas the hypothalamus arises from the prosencephalic diencephalon. Normal physiology involves balanced interaction between nociceptive afferents and descending antinociceptive pathways, mediated by serotonin, dopamine, and orexin systems. The hypothalamus also modulates autonomic outflow via parasympathetic efferents in the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) that activate the sphenopalatine ganglion, leading to lacrimation and nasal congestion seen in cluster headache.\nRelated syndromes include other trigeminal-autonomic cephalalgias such as paroxysmal hemicrania and SUNCT (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing). Historically, cluster headache was first described by Wilfred Harris in 1926 as ophthalmic megrim, evolving with advanced neuroimaging in the 1990s that identified hypothalamic activation on PET. Key landmarks include the cavernous sinus boundaries, Meckel\u2019s cave, and the mammillary bodies, all of which are critical to accurate imaging and stereotactic targeting.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, cluster headache involves aberrant activation of hypothalamic orexin neurons and dysregulated expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, and nitric oxide (NO) within trigeminovascular pathways. CGRP levels rise by 30\u201340% during attacks, measured in peripheral venous samples (Ashina et al., 2006). Orexin-A receptor hyperactivity in the posterior hypothalamus may lower the threshold for trigeminal nociception, while decreased melatonin secretion reflects circadian dysfunction.\nGenetically, familial hemiplegic genes such as CACNA1A and the HCRTR2 receptor gene have been implicated, with variants conferring an odds ratio of 1.8 for cluster susceptibility in genome-wide association studies (Greneche et al., 2018). Ion channel modulation involves voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav2.1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), promoting neurogenic inflammation by releasing proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and mast cell degranulation around the trigeminal ganglion.\nCellular signaling cascades engage the MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways, further amplifying vasodilation in meningeal vessels via endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Metabolically, the brain regions involved exhibit increased glucose uptake by 15\u201325% on functional imaging during attacks, suggesting elevated energy requirements. Pathological changes progress over minutes to hours per attack, with compensatory upregulation of descending serotonergic inhibition (5-HT1B/1D autoreceptors), which is the target for triptan therapies. However, this compensation is transient and fails to prevent recurrent attacks within cluster periods.","clinical_manifestation":"Cluster headache typically presents with sudden onset of severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain, peaking within 5\u201310 minutes and lasting 15\u2013180 minutes. Attacks occur in clusters of 1 to 8 episodes per day, with circadian regularity often at night or early morning. Pain intensity is excruciating, rated 8\u201310/10 on numerical scales. Patients exhibit ipsilateral autonomic signs including lacrimation (85% of cases), conjunctival injection (75%), nasal congestion (70%), rhinorrhea (60%), forehead and facial sweating, miosis, and ptosis.\nNeurological examination between attacks is normal, though during pain one may observe ptosis and eyelid edema. Pediatric-onset cluster headache is rare (<5% of cases) and may mimic migraine, whereas elderly-onset tends to have shorter cycles and lower attack frequency. Men are affected three times more often than women, though female cluster headache is associated with longer bouts and more frequent chronic forms (28% vs. 9%, respectively).\nSystemic symptoms such as agitation and pacing are common; nausea is uncommon (<10%). Severity scales include the Cluster Headache Severity Scale (CHSS), grading frequency, duration, and disability. Red flags such as sudden onset, focal deficits, or atypical autonomic signs warrant additional workup for secondary causes. Untreated, episodic cluster headache naturally remits within 6\u201312 weeks, though chronic cluster headache (persisting >1 year without remission or with remissions <3 months) may continue indefinitely.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Clinical diagnosis: Confirm criteria per International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3, 2018) including \u22655 attacks of severe unilateral orbital pain with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms, lasting 15\u2013180 minutes each without treatment (per ICHD-3, 2018).\n2. First-line imaging: Brain MRI with and without contrast to exclude secondary causes, utilizing T2-weighted, FLAIR, and thin-slice sequences through the cavernous sinus and pituitary region; sensitivity 98%, specificity 100% for alternative structural lesions (per AAN 2023 guidelines).\n3. Optional functional imaging: PET scan during an attack localizes hypothalamic activation in 76\u201384% of patients; considered research tool rather than routine clinical test (per European Headache Federation 2021 consensus statement).\n4.

Sumatriptan subcutaneous 6 mg single dose, repeatable once after 1 hour if necessary (per International Headache Society 2018); maximum 12 mg/day.\nTier 2 (Second-line): Transitional prophylaxis with corticosteroid burst: oral prednisone 60 mg/day for 5 days, then taper by 10 mg every 2 days over 10\u201314 days (clinical remission in 65% within 1 week; per European Headache Federation 2021). Verapamil extended-release starting at 80 mg TID, increase by 80 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum of 720 mg/day; ECG monitoring recommended (per AAN 2023 guidelines).\nTier 3 (Third-line): Refractory cases: neuromodulation including occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) with a 50\u201370% reduction in attack frequency in select cohorts (per Headache Surgery Consortium 2020). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posterior hypothalamus at 3.5\u20134.0 V, 60 \u00b5s pulse width, 130 Hz frequency shows 60% responder rate in chronic cases (per Neuromodulation Society guidelines 2022).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should be scheduled at 2 weeks after initiation of prophylactic therapy to assess efficacy and side effects, then monthly for the first 3 months, and every 3\u20136 months thereafter (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).

Laboratory surveillance includes electrolytes, liver function tests, and complete blood count every 3 months on corticosteroids (per European Headache Federation 2021).\nLong-term complications such as medication overuse headache occur in ~18% of patients when daily triptan use exceeds 10 days/month. Prognosis: episodic cluster headache remits in >90% within 1 year; chronic form persists beyond 1 year in ~10% of cases.
