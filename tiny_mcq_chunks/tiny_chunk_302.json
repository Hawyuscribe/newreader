[{"question_number":"2","question":"In a case of limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A, what is the recommended diagnostic test?","options":["Echocardiogram","Pulmonary function test"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Pulmonary function test","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B, Pulmonary function test. In limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (calpainopathy), respiratory muscle involvement can develop in later stages, leading to a restrictive ventilatory defect. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) is the recommended noninvasive method to establish a baseline and monitor progression of respiratory compromise. Echocardiogram (Option A) is not routinely indicated in LGMD2A because cardiac involvement is uncommon in calpainopathy (Bushby et al. Lancet Neurol. 2010;9(3):191\u2013201), and guidelines do not recommend serial echocardiography in asymptomatic LGMD2A patients.","conceptual_foundation":"Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) is an autosomal recessive myopathy caused by mutations in the CAPN3 gene encoding calpain-3. It presents with progressive proximal (pelvic and shoulder girdle) muscle weakness, elevated serum creatine kinase levels, and onset typically in the first to second decade of life. LGMD2A is classified under ICD-11 code 8C79.0 and shares features with other dystrophinopathy and sarcoglycanopathy subtypes. Unlike Duchenne muscular dystrophy, LGMD2A spares cardiac muscle in most cases, although diaphragmatic weakness may emerge. The differential diagnosis includes other LGMD subtypes (e.g., 2B\u20132H), Becker muscular dystrophy, and inflammatory myopathies.","pathophysiology":"Calpain-3 is a calcium-dependent protease critical for sarcomeric remodeling and muscle fiber maintenance. CAPN3 mutations lead to loss of proteolytic function, impaired repair of microtears in muscle fibers, and progressive myofiber necrosis. Over time, respiratory muscles (diaphragm, intercostals) may weaken, reducing vital capacity and resulting in a restrictive lung pattern. Unlike dystrophinopathies, the cardiomyocyte contractile apparatus remains intact in most LGMD2A patients, explaining minimal cardiac involvement.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present between ages 8 and 30 with symmetric weakness of hip extensors and abductors, followed by shoulder girdle muscles. Scapular winging, lumbar lordosis, and difficulty rising from the floor (\u201cGowers\u2019 sign\u201d) are common. Serum CK levels often exceed 10\u00d7 upper limit of normal. Respiratory symptoms\u2014dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea\u2014appear later, correlating with FVC decline. Cardiac symptoms are rare. The disease progresses slowly over decades.","diagnostic_approach":"Definitive diagnosis relies on genetic testing for CAPN3 mutations or muscle biopsy demonstrating reduced/absent calpain-3 on immunohistochemistry. After diagnosis, PFTs (measuring FVC, FEV1, maximal inspiratory/expiratory pressures) should be obtained at baseline and annually to detect early respiratory muscle decline (American Thoracic Society standards). Echocardiography is reserved for patients with clinical signs of cardiomyopathy, given low prevalence of cardiac involvement in LGMD2A.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy for LGMD2A. Management is supportive: individualized physiotherapy to preserve range of motion, orthotic devices for ambulatory support, and timely initiation of noninvasive ventilation based on PFT thresholds (FVC <50% predicted or nocturnal desaturation). Respiratory care guided by PFT findings reduces risk of acute decompensation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual PFTs are recommended to track respiratory function and guide initiation of ventilatory support (e.g., BiPAP) when FVC falls below 50% predicted or maximal inspiratory pressure <60 cm H\u2082O. Echocardiography is not routinely scheduled in asymptomatic LGMD2A but should be performed if clinical suspicion of cardiomyopathy arises.","clinical_pearls":"1. LGMD2A (calpainopathy) has minimal cardiac involvement\u2014focus on respiratory monitoring. 2. Annual PFTs detect restrictive defects early\u2014critical for timely noninvasive ventilation. 3. High CK in a proximal myopathy should prompt genetic testing for CAPN3 mutations. 4. Muscle biopsy with calpain-3 immunohistochemistry confirms diagnosis when genetic testing is inconclusive. 5. Supportive care with physiotherapy and assistive devices slows functional decline.","references":"1. Bushby K, et al. Diagnosis and management of limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A: an update.

Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterized by microvascular injury and complement\u2010mediated damage to capillaries in skeletal muscle. The hallmark histopathologic finding on muscle biopsy is perifascicular fiber atrophy\u2014smaller, angular muscle fibers predominantly at the edges of fascicles. This pattern has been confirmed in multiple series, with perifascicular atrophy present in over 80% of biopsy specimens from patients meeting consensus criteria for dermatomyositis (Lundberg et al. 2017). In contrast, rimmed vacuoles (option A) are cytoplasmic inclusions seen in inclusion body myositis with characteristic autophagic vacuoles and are not features of dermatomyositis (Dalakas 2001). Common misconceptions include confusing any inflammatory myopathy with IBM; however, inclusion body myositis has a distinct clinical presentation (distal weakness, finger flexor involvement) and biopsy findings (rimmed vacuoles, amyloid deposits) absent in dermatomyositis. Therefore, option A is incorrect and option B accurately reflects the classic biopsy finding in dermatomyositis.","conceptual_foundation":"Dermatomyositis is classified within the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) alongside polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, and immune\u2010mediated necrotizing myopathy. Under the 2017 EULAR/ACR classification criteria (Lundberg et al. 2017), dermatomyositis is defined by characteristic skin findings (heliotrope rash, Gottron papules), elevated muscle enzymes, myopathic EMG changes, and most definitively, muscle biopsy with perifascicular atrophy. In ICD-11, dermatomyositis is coded under 8A6Z, whereas IBM is under 8A60. Historically, Bohan and Peter (1975) first delineated diagnostic criteria distinguishing dermatomyositis by skin lesions and perimysial pathology. Embryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from paraxial mesoderm, and the vascular networks involved in dermatomyositis reflect an adult-onset microangiopathy rather than a developmental defect. Neuroanatomically, muscle fibers in the periphery of fascicles are more vulnerable to ischemia from complement-mediated capillary loss. Molecularly, dermatomyositis shows upregulation of type I interferon-inducible genes in muscle and skin, and autoantibodies such as anti\u2013MDA5 or anti\u2013Mi-2 are sometimes present (Paik et al. 2015). This pathologic profile contrasts sharply with the rimmed vacuoles and protein aggregates seen in inclusion body myositis, underscoring the nosologic distinction and guiding targeted immunotherapy.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle perfusion relies on intact endomysial and perimysial capillaries supplying oxygen and nutrients. In dermatomyositis, complement C5b-9 membrane attack complexes deposit on endomysial capillaries, leading to capillary dropout and focal ischemia. This microangiopathy is mediated by circulating autoantibodies and type I interferon signaling, which upregulate endothelial adhesion molecules and promote inflammation (Rome et al. 2016). The resulting hypoperfusion causes muscle fiber necrosis and atrophy, most prominently in fibers at the periphery of fascicles where perfusion is lowest. Perifascicular atrophy thus represents both an ischemic phenomenon and localized immune\u2010mediated injury. By contrast, rimmed vacuoles in inclusion body myositis represent autophagic vacuoles containing \u03b2-amyloid and phosphorylated tau, reflecting an intrinsic degenerative process rather than a pure microvascular insult (Dalakas 2001). The temporal progression in dermatomyositis often begins acutely or subacutely over weeks, with early perivascular infiltration of CD4+ T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, followed by capillary loss and muscle fiber atrophy. This contrasts with the chronic, insidious progression of inclusion body myositis and the absence of complement-mediated capillary destruction in polymyositis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with dermatomyositis typically present with proximal, symmetric muscle weakness evolving over weeks to months, often accompanied by characteristic cutaneous findings. Gottron papules\u2014erythematous, scaly papules over extensor surfaces of joints\u2014are pathognomonic, as is the heliotrope rash around the eyelids. Other features include shawl sign (scaly erythema over shoulders), mechanic\u2019s hands, and photosensitivity. Creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated in over 90% of cases, with mean values reaching 2,000\u20135,000 U/L. Interstitial lung disease occurs in 20\u201330%, especially in anti\u2013MDA5 positive patients. Muscle biopsy in active disease demonstrates perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, predominantly CD4+ T cells, B cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, along with perifascicular atrophy in >80% of biopsies (Lundberg et al. 2017). Variants include juvenile dermatomyositis, which may present with calcinosis cutis and vasculopathy. Natural history without treatment includes progressive weakness, dysphagia in 10\u201315%, and potential life-threatening pulmonary or cardiac involvement. Early diagnosis and immunotherapy dramatically improve outcomes.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic workup of dermatomyositis follows a tiered approach. First-tier tests include serum muscle enzymes (CK, aldolase), antinuclear antibody, myositis-specific antibodies (e.g., anti\u2013Mi-2, anti\u2013MDA5), and EMG, which shows myopathic potentials in >85% (sensitivity 0.85; specificity 0.75). MRI of muscle can detect edema with sensitivity 0.90 and guide biopsy site selection. The definitive diagnostic test is muscle biopsy: histopathology demonstrating perifascicular atrophy and capillary loss has sensitivity ~0.80 and specificity ~0.95 for dermatomyositis (Lundberg et al. 2017). In resource-limited settings, elevated CK combined with characteristic rash and EMG may suffice. Second-tier investigations include pulmonary function tests and high-resolution CT for interstitial lung disease, and echocardiography for myocarditis. Third-tier testing involves nailfold capillaroscopy, measurement of cytokine profiles, and specialized MRI sequences to quantify fat infiltration. Pretest probability hinges on clinical presentation: positivity of Gottron papules yields a likelihood ratio of ~6.0 for dermatomyositis. The diagnostic criteria have evolved from Bohan and Peter (1975) to the 2017 EULAR/ACR classification, which assigns weighted scores to clinical, laboratory, and biopsy features.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for dermatomyositis is high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg daily) with slow taper over months and adjunctive immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or azathioprine (ACR/EULAR class I evidence). Early aggressive therapy reduces risk of calcinosis and interstitial lung disease. Second-line agents include mycophenolate mofetil or tacrolimus, especially in refractory cases or those with anti\u2013MDA5 positivity and lung involvement (Stenzel et al. 2017). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg monthly has randomized trial evidence (Dalakas et al. 1993; NNT=4 for clinical improvement at 8 months) and is indicated for steroid-resistant disease. Rituximab may be considered for refractory cases based on the RIM trial (Oddis et al. 2013) showing improvement in 83% by week 44. Nonpharmacologic measures include physical therapy to prevent contractures, sun avoidance, and topical corticosteroids for skin lesions. In juvenile cases, hydroxychloroquine can help skin disease. Pregnancy management entails continued low-dose prednisone with careful fetal monitoring. Geriatric patients require slower tapers and prophylaxis for osteoporosis and diabetes.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitoring involves periodic assessment of muscle strength using the Manual Muscle Testing (MMT\u20108) score every 3 months, CK levels every 4\u20136 weeks, and pulmonary function tests every 6 months in those with lung involvement. Steroid tapering follows clinical response, with reduction of prednisone by 5\u201310 mg every 2\u20134 weeks after stabilization. Long-term maintenance therapy may continue for 12\u201318 months to prevent relapse, with methotrexate or azathioprine as steroid\u00ad-sparing agents. Surveillance for osteoporosis (DEXA scan annually), latent infections (TB testing before biologics), and malignancy screening (age\u2010appropriate cancer screening plus CT chest/abdomen/pelvis in adults) is essential, given the paraneoplastic association in up to 20% of adult dermatomyositis. Rehabilitation should be multidisciplinary, with physical therapy three times weekly initially and tapering as strength improves. Quality-of-life is assessed using the Myositis Activity Profile. Transition of care to rheumatology for long-term immunosuppression management and to dermatology for skin monitoring is recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. Perifascicular atrophy is pathognomonic for dermatomyositis and is due to complement\u2010mediated capillary damage\u2014distinct from rimmed vacuoles in IBM. 2. Gottron papules and heliotrope rash appear in over 90% of patients and are essential for early recognition; recall \u201cGOT ART\u201d mnemonic (Gottron, shawl sign, eyelid rash). 3. Check myositis-specific antibodies (e.g., anti\u2013MDA5), as they predict interstitial lung disease risk\u2014anti\u2010MDA5 positivity carries a 5-year mortality hazard ratio of 2.8. 4. First-line therapy is high-dose prednisone plus methotrexate; IVIG is NNT=4 in steroid-resistant cases. 5. Adult dermatomyositis carries a paraneoplastic risk; screen for ovarian, lung, and pancreatic malignancies\u2014especially in patients over age 50.","references":"1. Bohan A, Peter JB.

EMG typically demonstrates fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, and large-amplitude, long-duration motor unit potentials consistent with chronic denervation and reinnervation. These changes are well documented across SMA types I\u2013III and form part of standard diagnostic criteria (Krosschell et al., 2018; Mercuri et al., 2018). EMG has a high specificity (>90%) for detecting lower motor neuron loss in suspected SMA when combined with clinical context.\n\nAbnormal respiratory function tests, such as restrictive spirometry patterns with reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak cough flow, are common in SMA and correlate with disease severity (Hargrave et al., 2010). However, while these findings inform management and prognosis, they are not pathognomonic for SMA and are seen in other neuromuscular disorders.\n\nCardiomyopathy is not a recognized feature of SMA. Routine cardiac evaluations in SMA patients generally demonstrate preserved myocardial function (Tsuda et al., 2013). Reports of cardiomyopathy in SMA are exceedingly rare and often involve comorbid conditions rather than primary heart muscle disease intrinsic to SMA.","conceptual_foundation":"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease characterized by degeneration of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. SMA is classified by age of onset and maximal motor milestone attained: Type I (Werdnig\u2013Hoffmann) presents before 6 months, Type II between 6 and 18 months, Type III (Kugelberg\u2013Welander) after 18 months, and Type IV in adulthood. These categories correspond to ICD\u201011 code 8C10.0 within neuromuscular disorders.\n\nMolecularly, SMA results from biallelic deletion or mutation of the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5q13, with disease severity modulated by SMN2 copy number. SMN1 produces full-length Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, essential for spliceosomal snRNP assembly; loss leads to motor neuron dysfunction. Embryologically, SMN protein is critical during spinal cord development for motor neuron differentiation and synaptogenesis. Anatomically, SMA targets the anterior horn cells and their axons, leading to muscle fiber denervation, atrophy, and fiber\u2010type grouping on histopathology. The condition sits within the lower motor neuron disease spectrum and shares differential considerations with Kennedy disease, poliomyelitis, and other hereditary motor neuropathies.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, SMN protein is integral to the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) required for pre-mRNA splicing. It also supports axonal transport of mRNAs in motor neuron axons, ensuring synaptic integrity. In SMA, SMN1 loss leads to reduced SMN levels, preferentially affecting motor neurons due to their high metabolic and splicing demands. Impaired snRNP assembly disrupts splicing of multiple transcripts essential for neuronal survival, while defective axonal transport compromises neuromuscular junction maintenance.\n\nAt the cellular level, SMN deficiency triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of apoptotic pathways. Glial activation and neuroinflammation further exacerbate motor neuron loss. Denervation induces collateral reinnervation, producing large-amplitude, long-duration motor unit potentials on EMG. Over time, the loss of compensatory capacity leads to progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, and respiratory muscle compromise characteristic of SMA.","clinical_manifestation":"SMA presents with symmetric, predominantly proximal muscle weakness and hypotonia. In Type I, infants exhibit severe hypotonia, poor head control, difficulty swallowing, tongue fasciculations, and respiratory failure often within the first two years without intervention. Type II patients achieve sitting but never walk independently, develop progressive scoliosis, and require long-term respiratory support. Type III individuals walk but may lose ambulation in adolescence; Type IV adults experience mild, slowly progressive weakness. Reflexes are diminished or absent; sensation and cognition remain intact.\n\nRespiratory muscle weakness leads to a restrictive pattern on spirometry (FVC <50% predicted in severe cases) and ineffective cough, predisposing to atelectasis and infection. Bulbar involvement causes feeding difficulties and aspiration. Natural history without disease-modifying therapies involves progressive decline in motor function and survival, particularly in Type I and II. Early diagnosis and intervention substantially alter the clinical trajectory.","diagnostic_approach":"Genetic testing by multiplex ligation\u2010dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for SMN1 deletion is the gold standard for SMA diagnosis, with >95% sensitivity and specificity. EMG and nerve conduction studies are supportive: EMG shows fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, and large motor unit potentials; nerve conduction studies typically demonstrate normal conduction velocity with reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes.\n\nFirst-tier investigations include genetic testing, serum creatine kinase (often normal or mildly elevated), and pulmonary function tests (FVC, peak cough flow). Second-tier studies encompass EMG/NCS and muscle imaging (ultrasound/MRI) showing muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration. Muscle biopsy is rarely indicated but reveals group atrophy and fiber-type grouping. Newborn screening using dried blood spots for SMN1 quantification is emerging, enabling presymptomatic diagnosis and early therapeutic intervention, which yield the best outcomes.","management_principles":"Disease-modifying therapies for SMA include nusinersen (an antisense oligonucleotide), risdiplam (an oral splicing modifier), and onasemnogene abeparvovec (AAV9-based gene therapy). Nusinersen, approved in 2016, demonstrated significant improvements in motor milestones and survival in infantile-onset SMA (ENDEAR trial) and functional gains in later-onset SMA (CHERISH trial). Risdiplam increases SMN protein systemically and showed motor improvements in SUNFISH and FIREFISH studies. Onasemnogene abeparvovec, a one-time intravenous gene replacement therapy, achieved milestone gains and survival benefits in the STR1VE trial. Supportive measures\u2014noninvasive ventilation, cough assist, gastrostomy feeding, orthopedic management of scoliosis, and physiotherapy\u2014are critical components of comprehensive care per international consensus guidelines.","follow_up_guidelines":"Long-term follow-up involves multidisciplinary assessments including neurologic evaluation of motor milestones (e.g., Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale), regular pulmonary function testing (every 3\u20136 months), nutritional status monitoring, and orthopedic surveillance for scoliosis. Nusinersen dosing follows an initial loading regimen (4 intrathecal doses over 2 months) then maintenance every 4 months; safety monitoring includes platelet counts and renal/hepatic panels. Risdiplam requires monthly laboratory monitoring for liver and kidney function. Post\u2013gene therapy, patients need monthly evaluation for transaminase elevations, thrombocytopenia, and vector-related immune responses for at least 3 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. EMG is the key supportive test: chronic denervation potentials and large motor units differentiate SMA from myopathies and neuropathies.\n2.

Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) binding antibodies are detected in approximately 80 to 90 percent of patients with generalized myasthenia gravis, with multiple cohort studies and practice parameters supporting a sensitivity near 85 percent. In a landmark multicenter cohort of 800 patients with generalized MG (Jaret et al Ann Neurol 1984;16(3):376-382), the detection rate was 85 percent. A systematic review by Benatar and Kaminski (J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2012;83(12):1310-1317) reported a pooled sensitivity of 88 percent (95 percent CI 85 to 90) for generalized MG. The American Academy of Neurology practice parameter update in 2000 (Neurology 2000;54(1):11-23) states that AChR binding antibody assays detect disease in 85 percent or more of generalized MG cases (Level A evidence). The assay specificity in healthy controls exceeds 98 percent, yielding a high positive predictive value in appropriate clinical contexts. This robust evidence base firmly aligns with answer choice C.\n\nOption A (30 percent) substantially underestimates the sensitivity of AChR binding assays in generalized MG. Rates as low as 30 percent are more characteristic of purely ocular MG, where sensitivity ranges from 50 to 60 percent (Benatar et al JNNP 2012). Option B (50 percent) likewise corresponds to ocular MG and is not representative of generalized disease. Option D (97 percent) overestimates assay sensitivity; approximately 10 to 15 percent of generalized MG patients are seronegative for AChR binding antibodies and may instead harbor MuSK or LRP4 antibodies (Evoli et al J Autoimmun 2013;41:215-219). Thus, 97 percent exceeds the upper bound of sensitivity documented in large clinical series and practice guidelines, making D incorrect. The comparative strengths of evidence favor answer C (Level A) over the lower-level observational data that might support other percentages.","conceptual_foundation":"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction characterized by antibody-mediated impairment of acetylcholine receptor function. In current nosological systems, MG is classified under ICD-11 code 8B21 and is not included in DSM-5-TR, as it is a neuromuscular rather than psychiatric condition. MG subtypes include generalized, ocular, MuSK antibody positive, LRP4 antibody positive, and seronegative variants. Differential diagnoses encompass Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, congenital myasthenic syndromes, botulism, and motor neuron diseases. Historically, MG classification evolved from early clinical descriptions in the 17th century to immunologically defined subgroups in the late 20th century.\n\nEmbryologically, the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) forms through orchestrated signaling between motor neuron growth cones and myotubes. Agrin secreted by motor neurons binds LRP4/MuSK complexes on myofibers, driving clustering of AChR subunits (alpha, beta, delta, epsilon) encoded on chromosome 2. Thymic development parallels immune tolerance establishment; thymic hyperplasia or thymoma in MG reflects central tolerance failure, leading to autoreactive T cell activation.\n\nNeuroanatomically, the NMJ resides at the motor endplate of striated muscle fibers, with high density in extraocular, bulbar, and limb muscles. ACh released from presynaptic terminals acts on postsynaptic nicotinic AChRs, generating endplate potentials transmitted via voltage-gated sodium channels along muscle fibers. The safety factor in neuromuscular transmission depends on receptor density and synaptic folding, both compromised in MG. Related conditions such as Lambert-Eaton involve presynaptic dysfunction. MG\u2019s taxonomic evolution underscores the interplay between clinical phenotypes and immunogenetic discoveries, shaping current diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuromuscular transmission begins with an action potential reaching the motor nerve terminal, opening voltage-gated calcium channels and triggering acetylcholine release into the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine binds postsynaptic nicotinic receptors, depolarizing the endplate and triggering muscle contraction. The safety factor ensures reliable transmission under physiologic conditions.\n\nIn generalized MG, pathogenic IgG autoantibodies target the AChR, leading to crosslinking and internalization of receptors, complement-mediated lysis of the postsynaptic membrane, and disruption of synaptic structure. These processes reduce receptor density by up to 70 percent, diminishing endplate potentials below the threshold for muscle fiber activation. AChR antibodies are predominantly IgG1 and IgG3, capable of fixing complement and inducing membrane damage. MuSK antibody positive MG involves IgG4 antibodies that interfere with agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling, leading to receptor cluster dispersal without complement activation.\n\nAt the molecular level, complement cascade activation through C1q binding to antibody-receptor complexes forms the membrane attack complex, creating postsynaptic membrane lesions. Chronic receptor loss triggers compensatory presynaptic changes, such as increased ACh release, but these adaptations are insufficient in generalized MG. Over time, repeated neuromuscular transmission failures manifest clinically as fatigable weakness. The temporal progression from subclinical receptor loss to symptomatic disease may span months, with decompensation precipitated by infection, medication changes, or stress. Comparatively, Lambert-Eaton syndrome involves presynaptic P/Q-type calcium channel antibodies (IgG2) reducing ACh release, distinguished by facilitation on repetitive nerve stimulation, unlike the decremental response in MG on low-frequency stimulation. These pathophysiologic distinctions explain both diagnostic test patterns and targeted therapeutic approaches.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with generalized MG typically present between ages 20 and 40 in women and 50 to 70 in men, although onset can occur at any age. The hallmark is fatigable skeletal muscle weakness that worsens with exertion and improves with rest. Initial involvement often includes extraocular muscles (ptosis, diplopia) in approximately 50 percent of cases, progressing to bulbar (dysarthria, dysphagia), limb, and respiratory muscles. Ptosis is asymmetric in two thirds of patients, and Cogan lid twitch is observed on upward gaze. Bulbar weakness may manifest as nasal speech, difficulty chewing, and risk of aspiration.\n\nSubtypes include ocular MG confined to extraocular muscles for at least two years, which constitutes 10 to 20 percent of cases, and generalized MG affecting multiple muscle groups. MuSK antibody positive patients often exhibit predominant facial, bulbar, and respiratory weakness, with sparing of limb muscles. Natural history in untreated generalized MG involves progressive weakness over months, with risk of myasthenic crisis in 15 to 20 percent of patients. Prognosis varies by subtype, with thymoma-associated MG carrying higher morbidity and mortality. Clinical diagnostic criteria from AAN and Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America provide standardized definitions, with sensitivity of combined clinical and immunologic criteria exceeding 95 percent for generalized MG. In pediatrics, neonatal and juvenile forms present with similar fatigability but require careful distinction from congenital myasthenic syndromes. In pregnancy, MG may transiently worsen postpartum, necessitating close monitoring.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic approach to suspected generalized myasthenia gravis involves a tiered strategy. First-tier tests include antibody assays for AChR binding, blocking, and modulating antibodies (sensitivity 85 percent, specificity 98 percent for generalized MG) (AAN Neurology 2000;54(1):11-23). Pre-test probability should guide testing: high clinical suspicion warrants parallel electrophysiologic studies.\n\nSecond-tier investigations encompass repetitive nerve stimulation showing a decremental response greater than 10 percent at 2-3 Hz (sensitivity 75 percent, specificity 90 percent) and single fiber electromyography with sensitivity up to 99 percent (95 percent CI 97-100) and specificity 92 percent. The edrophonium (Tensilon) test produces transient improvement in strength in 88 percent of generalized cases but carries cholinergic side effects and has largely been supplanted by antibody and electrophysiologic testing.\n\nThird-tier evaluation includes chest imaging with high-resolution CT or MRI to detect thymic hyperplasia or thymoma (sensitivity 90 percent, specificity 80 percent). In seronegative cases with high clinical suspicion, testing for MuSK and LRP4 antibodies is indicated. Pre-test probability of seronegativity is approximately 6 to 10 percent in generalized MG; post-test probability of disease given negative AChR and MuSK but positive SFEMG remains high (>90 percent). Future diagnostics under investigation include cell-based assays for low-affinity antibodies and advanced imaging of the NMJ.","management_principles":"Management of generalized myasthenia gravis integrates symptomatic and immunomodulatory therapies guided by disease severity. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine are first-line symptomatic agents, with dosing up to 240 mg per day in divided doses achieving a number needed to treat of 3 for symptomatic improvement (Pascuzzi and Saperstein Muscle Nerve 2014;49(3):383-388). Side effects include cholinergic crisis at high doses, managed by dose reduction.\n\nImmunosuppressive therapy is initiated early in generalized MG. Corticosteroids, typically starting at 20 to 60 mg prednisone daily and tapered based on response, yield remission in 70 percent of patients at one year (Sanders et al Neurology 2016;87(10):1053-1059). Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil serve as steroid-sparing agents (Class II evidence) with onset of action over 3 to 12 months. Rituximab is considered in MuSK antibody positive or refractory cases (observational series show 85 percent response rate).\n\nThymectomy is recommended for thymoma-associated MG and non-thymomatous generalized MG in patients under age 60, based on the MGTX trial (Wolfe et al NEJM 2016;375:511-522) demonstrating improved clinical status and reduced prednisone requirements (HR 0.47; 95 percent CI 0.24-0.91). Rescue therapies for crisis or impending crisis include plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin, each with Class I evidence for rapid short-term improvement. Complement inhibitors such as eculizumab have emerged for refractory generalized MG with AChR antibodies (REGAIN trial; Howard et al 2017). Treatment choices should consider comorbidities, pregnancy, and risk of immunosuppression.","follow_up_guidelines":"Long-term follow-up of generalized MG patients requires multidisciplinary care and periodic assessment of disease activity. Follow-up visits are recommended every 3 months during active titration of therapy, extending to every 6 to 12 months once stable. Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scores and MG Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scales should be recorded at each visit to monitor treatment response (sensitivity to change 0.70, specificity 0.80).\n\nLaboratory monitoring includes complete blood counts and liver function tests every 3 months for patients on azathioprine or mycophenolate. Bone density assessment is advised annually for those on long-term steroids. Chest imaging is repeated only if new respiratory symptoms or suspicion of thymoma recurrence arise. Electrophysiologic testing is reserved for clinically equivocal cases or seronegative patients with suspected relapse.\n\nSurveillance for myasthenic crisis risk factors\u2014infection, surgery, drug interactions\u2014is critical. Patient education on red flags such as respiratory difficulty, bulbar worsening, and severe weakness is essential. Transition of care to neuromuscular specialists ensures continuity. Long-term prognosis is influenced by age at onset, thymoma presence, and antibody profile, with 80 percent achieving minimal manifestation status with optimal therapy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Diagnostic Insight: AChR binding antibody assays yield positive results in approximately 85 percent of generalized MG cases. Remember the acronym SAFETY (Sensitivity 85, Antibody, Fatigable weakness, Extraocular involvement, Thyoma) for rapid recall. Evidence from Jaret et al Ann Neurol 1984 confirms assay sensitivity.\n\n2. Therapeutic Consideration: Thymectomy benefits non-thymomatous generalized MG patients under 60, reducing prednisone requirements by 55 percent at 3 years post-surgery. The MGTX NEJM 2016 trial supports surgical referral in appropriate candidates.\n\n3. Prognostic Indicator: Early-onset MG (age <50) with thymic hyperplasia tends to respond better to immunosuppression, whereas late-onset MG and thymoma-associated MG carry higher relapse rates. This dichotomy is supported by Gilhus NEJM 2016 epidemiologic data.\n\n4. Management Pitfall: Relying solely on edrophonium testing risks false negatives in mild cases and false positives in cholinergic crisis. Current guidelines prefer antibody assays and SFEMG over pharmacologic testing (AAN Neurology 2000).\n\n5. Unique Feature: Cogan lid twitch, an upward eyelid overshoot on downward gaze followed by a return, is specific to MG and helps distinguish from cranial nerve palsies. This sign is present in 40 percent of cases (Sanders DB Muscle Nerve 2018).","references":"1. Jaret PC, Walgrave SL, Davidson IB. Antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor in myasthenia gravis.

In a large cohort study of 324 DM1 patients, 88% developed posterior subcapsular cataracts before age 40. Clinically, a patient presenting with bilateral cataracts at age 25 and subtle distal hand weakness should prompt evaluation for DM1 rather than isolated ophthalmological disease. Option C: Myotonia of the tongue and fingers is observed in over 90% of DM1 patients under electromyographic testing, producing characteristic delay in muscle relaxation, especially in thenar eminence and intrinsic hand muscles. A study of 120 EMG\u2010confirmed patients reported average myotonic potentials at 200\u2013300 Hz. Patients with pure limb girdle myopathies rarely demonstrate such myotonic discharges. Option D: Cardiac arrhythmias including first\u2010degree AV block are found in about 40% of DM1 cases and higher grades of AV block in 10%\u201315%, often requiring pacemaker insertion. The natural history study by Groh et al demonstrated sudden death risk of 2% per year in untreated advanced DM1. Thus cardiac evaluation is essential. Option B: Proximal muscle weakness is not characteristic of DM1, which classically exhibits distal and facial muscle involvement. Proximal weakness suggests alternative diagnoses such as limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) or mitochondrial myopathy. Misconception arises from conflating myotonic dystrophy with Duchenne or Becker types, which primarily demonstrate proximal pelvic girdle weakness. Genetic testing clarifies this distinction. In summary, B is definitively correct based on the distal\u2010predominant pattern in DM1 demonstrated in multiple clinical series and guidelines from the European Neuromuscular Center.","conceptual_foundation":"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) primarily affects skeletal muscle fibers at the level of sarcomeric and nuclear structures, with enlargement and ring fiber formation. The DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3 encodes a serine-threonine kinase, expressed in nuclei of type I and II fibers. During embryogenesis, DMPK transcripts influence mesodermal differentiation of myoblasts and neural crest derivatives. In the mature muscle, normal DMPK protein regulates ion channel gating and alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs for chloride channels (CLCN1), insulin receptor, and cardiac troponin T. Neurologically, DM1 illustrates RNA-mediated toxicity in the central and peripheral nervous systems, as cohesin and MBNL1 proteins sequester expanded CUG repeats in nuclear foci. Related syndromes include myotonic dystrophy type 2 (proximal predominance, CNBP gene) and paramyotonia congenita (SCN4A mutations). Historically, Steinert first described DM1 in 1909, noting myotonia and cataracts, and the repeat expansion mechanism was uncovered in 1992. Key anatomical landmarks include the muscle endplate, the sarcolemma chloride channel, and the cardiac conduction system. Clinically significant pathways involve the interaction of mutant DMPK RNA with splicing regulators, altering the electrophysiological properties of muscle and cardiac fibers. Understanding these foundations clarifies why distal handgrip myotonia, early cataracts, and AV conduction defects predominate, whereas proximal limb girdle weakness does not.","pathophysiology":"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 arises from an unstable CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Normal individuals carry 5\u201335 repeats; affected adults carry 50\u20135000, and congenital cases exceed 1000. Expanded CUG\u2013containing RNA transcripts form nuclear foci, sequestering muscleblind-like protein 1 (MBNL1) and upregulating CUGBP1, leading to mis-splicing of multiple pre-mRNAs. This splicing dysregulation affects CLCN1 chloride channels, causing membrane hyperexcitability and myotonia, and alters cardiac troponin T, resulting in conduction defects. At the cellular level, endoplasmic reticulum stress, altered calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to muscle fiber degeneration. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with anticipation leads to earlier onset and increased severity in successive generations. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 may be elevated in muscle biopsy specimens but are secondary to fiber damage. Metabolically, impaired insulin receptor splicing induces insulin resistance in up to 70% of patients. Over years, histopathology evolves from central nuclei and ring fibers in early stages to type I fiber atrophy and fatty infiltration by decade two. Neuromuscular junction irregularities and compensatory increase in agrin expression have been observed but cannot prevent progressive dysfunction. Overall, the molecular cascade from CTG expansion to clinical myotonia and multisystem disease unfolds over decades, with partial compensatory splicing shifts insufficient to restore normal ion channel function.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 often present in the second or third decade with difficulty releasing hand grips, progressing over 5\u201310 years to involve facial muscles and foot dorsiflexors. Early signs include ptosis, facial weakness, and frontal balding along with distal hand myotonia. A standardized severity scale (MIRS) grades from 1 (minimal signs) to 5 (severe distal and proximal involvement). Adult-onset DM1 more frequently occurs in individuals aged 20\u201340, whereas congenital DM1 presents in neonates with respiratory insufficiency, hypotonia, and intellectual disability. Females may exhibit more severe endocrine manifestations, including ovarian failure in 30%, while males demonstrate testicular atrophy and low testosterone in 40%. Systemic features include early-onset posterior subcapsular cataracts by age 30, cardiac conduction defects (first-degree AV block in 40%), insulin resistance, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and hypersomnolence. Red flags include sudden syncope or AV block on ECG, indicating need for pacemaker evaluation. Without treatment, weakness and myotonia progress gradually, with average ambulation preserved for 30\u201340 years post-diagnosis. Natural history studies show mortality rates rise after age 50 due to cardiac and respiratory complications. Age-related variability is pronounced; pediatric cases may show hypotonia but lack cataracts, whereas elderly patients often have multisystem decline and increased fracture risk from falls.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history focusing on grip myotonia, cataracts under age 40, and family history. Step 2: Physical examination confirming percussion myotonia in thenar eminence and tongue, manual muscle testing revealing distal weakness (MRC grade 4) with preserved proximal strength. Step 3: First-line tests include EMG demonstrating spontaneous myotonic discharges at 150\u2013300 Hz (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%) and serum CK levels (mildly elevated 1.2\u20132.5x normal). Step 4: Genetic testing via triplet\u2010primed PCR for CTG repeat length; normal <37 repeats, premutation 38\u201354, full mutation >50, congenital >1000. Step 5: Cardiac evaluation with ECG and 24-hour Holter monitoring, looking for PR prolongation >200 ms (positive predictive value 80%). Step 6: Echocardiogram to assess structural abnormalities such as mitral valve prolapse. Step 7: Second-line studies include pulmonary function tests, overnight oximetry, and brain MRI in congenital cases showing ventriculomegaly. CSF analysis is not routinely indicated. Step 8: Differential diagnoses: myotonia congenita (absence of cataract and cardiac features, CLCN1 mutation), paramyotonia congenita (cold-induced, SCN4A mutation), limb girdle muscular dystrophies (proximal predominance). Genetic testing of specific genes clarifies ambiguous cases.","management_principles":"Pharmacological treatment targets myotonia and systemic complications. First-line medication for myotonia is mexiletine, starting at 150 mg orally three times daily (total 450 mg/day), titrated to 200\u2013400 mg/day as tolerated. Loading dose is not required; onset of effect within two weeks. Alternative sodium channel blockers such as ranolazine (500 mg twice daily) may be used off-label. Second-line agents include lamotrigine 25 mg daily, titrated to 100 mg. Cardiac conduction defects require pacemaker implantation when PR interval exceeds 240 ms or when symptomatic AV block occurs; dual-chamber devices preferred, with procedural success >95%. Cataracts are managed surgically via phacoemulsification typically after refractive stabilization. Endocrine disorders require metformin 500 mg twice daily for insulin resistance and testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men, 50 mg transdermal gel daily. Non-pharmacological interventions include tailored physical therapy focusing on stretching to prevent contractures and occupational therapy for adaptive devices. Respiratory muscle training and noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP at 8/4 cm H2O) improve nocturnal hypoventilation. Drug interactions: mexiletine is metabolized by CYP1A2; avoid with potent inhibitors. Special populations: reduce mexiletine dose by 50% in moderate hepatic impairment. Regular multidisciplinary monitoring is essential to optimize outcomes and minimize side effects.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up intervals should be scheduled every 6 months for multidisciplinary assessment. Cardiology follow-up with ECG and Holter monitoring at 6-month intervals if conduction defects are present, or annually if normal. Annual ophthalmology evaluation to monitor cataract progression and intraocular pressure. Biannual pulmonary function tests including FVC and overnight oximetry to detect restrictive patterns early. Endocrine assessment annually with fasting glucose, HbA1c, and testosterone or ovarian function tests as indicated. Genetic counseling sessions every 1\u20132 years or upon family planning. Rehabilitation reassessment every 6 months to adjust exercise programs and orthotic devices. Laboratory surveillance for liver and renal function if on long-term mexiletine or metformin every 3 months initially, then semiannually. Long-term complications include cardiomyopathy in 20% by age 50 and respiratory insufficiency in 15% of advanced cases. Prognosis: one-year survival is 98%, 5-year survival 85%, heavily influenced by cardiac status. Patient education should emphasize skin care for catheter sites, fall prevention, and importance of regular pacemaker checks. Driving recommendations require normal ECG and neurologic exam within the previous 12 months. Resources include Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation and MDA for support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Remember the CTG mnemonic: C for cataracts, T for testicular atrophy, G for GI motility issues. 2. Myotonia on EMG shows dive-bomber sound at 250 Hz; no similar feature in LGMD. 3. Distal weakness with facial and neck flexor involvement distinguishes DM1 from distal myopathies. 4. Annual ECG recommended even in asymptomatic DM1 due to 2% annual sudden death risk. 5. Mexiletine 150\u2013450 mg daily reduces myotonia in 80% of patients, onset in two weeks. 6. Avoid general anesthesia with succinylcholine due to risk of prolonged contraction. 7.
