[{"question_number":"2","question":"A patient has tongue deviation to the left. Which area of the brain is likely affected?","options":["Right medulla","Left medulla","Right midbrain","Left midbrain"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Left medulla","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B (Left medulla). Tongue deviation to the left indicates weakness of the left genioglossus muscle, innervated by the left hypoglossal (XII) nerve or nucleus. When the hypoglossal nucleus or exiting rootlets in the medulla are lesioned, tongue protrudes toward the affected side. Options A (Right medulla), C (Right midbrain), and D (Left midbrain) do not correspond to hypoglossal nucleus locations.","conceptual_foundation":"The hypoglossal nucleus lies in the dorsal medulla at the floor of the fourth ventricle, medial to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The nerve exits between the pyramid and olive and innervates intrinsic and extrinsic tongue muscles. Lesions central to the nucleus (upper motor neuron) cause contralateral deviation; lesions at or below the nucleus (lower motor neuron) cause ipsilateral deviation.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, bilateral genioglossus muscles push the tongue forward symmetrically. A unilateral LMN lesion of the hypoglossal nerve prevents contraction on that side, so the intact contralateral muscle pushes the tongue toward the weak side. No midbrain lesions involve XII; medullary lesions at the level of the nucleus or root are responsible.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with tongue deviation ipsilaterally on protrusion, ipsilateral atrophy and fasciculations of the tongue with chronic lesions. Dysarthria, dysphagia to oral phase, and drooling may accompany LMN hypoglossal palsy. Central lesions give mild contralateral deviation without fasciculations.","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical exam localizes the lesion; MRI brainstem confirms lesion in the medulla. Consider vascular (PICA), demyelinating, or compressive etiologies. Electromyography of the tongue can confirm denervation potentials in chronic lesions.","management_principles":"Treat underlying cause: ischemic infarct management per AHA/ASA, surgical removal for compressive lesions, immunotherapy for demyelinating lesions. Supportive therapy includes speech and swallowing rehabilitation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor tongue strength and function over 3\u20136 months. Repeat imaging if deficits worsen. Long-term rehabilitation may require neuromuscular stimulation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Tongue deviates toward LMN lesion side. 2. Fasciculations indicate LMN involvement. 3. Midbrain lesions do not affect XII. 4. Central XII lesion causes mild contralateral deviation without atrophy. 5. Hypoglossal palsy often presents with dysarthria and dysphagia.","references":"1.

Prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize faces, is localized to the fusiform face area in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, especially in the right hemisphere (Barton 2011). Option A (Temporal) is too general; the critical area is the occipital-temporal junction. Option B (Parietal) is incorrect as parietal lobe lesions produce visuospatial deficits but not isolated prosopagnosia. Option C (Frontal) is incorrect; frontal lesions impair executive function and social behavior but do not cause pure face recognition deficits.","conceptual_foundation":"Face recognition involves hierarchically organized visual processing streams. Early visual cortex (V1\u2013V3) encodes basic features; the lateral occipital complex processes shapes; the fusiform face area in the occipito-temporal cortex integrates configural information for face identity. Prosopagnosia can be congenital or acquired; acquired forms follow infarction, trauma, or degenerative disease in the fusiform region (ICD-11 6D43). Differential includes visual agnosia and memory impairment.","pathophysiology":"Normal face recognition relies on specialized neurons in the fusiform gyrus that respond selectively to facial stimuli. Lesions disrupt configural processing of facial features. In acquired prosopagnosia, infarction of PCA territory or traumatic injury to occipito-temporal regions leads to loss of fusiform function. This spares other visual functions such as object recognition, explaining selective deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with prosopagnosia fail to identify familiar faces and may rely on non-facial cues (voice, gait). They may have intact visual acuity and object recognition. Testing includes matching tasks (Cambridge Face Memory Test) and naming of famous faces. Prosopagnosia may be accompanied by topographical disorientation if more posterior lesions are involved.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, confirmed with neuropsychological testing of face perception and memory (e.g., Benton Facial Recognition Test). MRI localizes lesion to fusiform gyrus. Functional imaging (fMRI) can show reduced activation in the fusiform face area during face viewing.","management_principles":"No specific pharmacotherapy exists. Compensatory strategies include training to use non-facial cues. Cognitive rehabilitation may improve recognition strategies. Patient and family education is essential to set expectations and safety planning.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up focuses on functional adaptation and safety. Periodic neuropsychological reassessment can track any recovery or compensatory improvement. Referral to low-vision or cognitive rehabilitation services may be beneficial.","clinical_pearls":"1. Prosopagnosia localizes to the fusiform face area in ventral occipito-temporal cortex. 2. It is distinct from visual agnosia; patients recognize objects but not faces. 3. Right-hemisphere lesions more commonly produce prosopagnosia. 4. Diagnosis relies on specialized face memory tests. 5. Management is largely compensatory and supportive.","references":"1. Barton JJS.

This distinguishes it from hydromyelia which is a true dilation of the central canal (option B) with intact ependymal lining, a feature not preserved in true syringomyelia. Option C is partially true\u2014syringomyelia does involve disruption of ependyma\u2014but it does not alone define the entity. Option D is therefore incorrect because the ependymal lining is typically destroyed in syringomyelia, not preserved as stated in option B. Numerous neuropathological studies (Milhorat et al. J Neurosurg 1995;83(5):800\u2013808) confirm that the syrinx forms within the substance of the cord, separating and compressing white matter tracts, rather than simply expanding the existing central canal.","conceptual_foundation":"Syringomyelia is classified under ICD-11 code 8A41 as a cystic cavitation of the spinal cord parenchyma. Embryologically, the spinal cord central canal arises from the neural tube lumen; with aberrant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics\u2014often due to Chiari I malformation or trauma\u2014fluid dissects into the substance of the cord. Differential diagnoses include hydromyelia, ependymal cysts, arachnoid cysts, and intramedullary tumors. Historically, the term \u201chydromyelia\u201d referred to central canal dilation in children, while \u201csyringomyelia\u201d described adult intramedullary cavities; modern nosology groups both under syringomyelia when the ependyma is disrupted.","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF circulates in the subarachnoid space and central canal. In syringomyelia, obstruction of CSF flow at the foramen magnum or spinal subarachnoid space\u2014due to Chiari malformation, arachnoiditis, or trauma\u2014creates a pressure gradient that forces CSF into the spinal cord via perivascular (Virchow-Robin) spaces. Repeated pulsations expand a fluid\u2010filled cavity that disrupts local microcirculation, resulting in white matter tract degeneration. The destruction of ependymal lining differentiates syringomyelia from hydromyelia, which preserves this lining. Cavitation first affects decussating spinothalamic fibers, leading to the classic dissociated sensory loss.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients frequently present in young adulthood with progressive 'cape-like' loss of pain and temperature over the shoulders and arms, while light touch and proprioception remain intact. Motor involvement of anterior horn cells can cause segmental weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations. Associated symptoms include scoliosis in pediatric cases and spasticity below the level of the lesion as the syrinx expands. Natural history without intervention often leads to gradual neurological decline over years.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI of the spinal cord is the gold standard, demonstrating a T1-hypointense, T2-hyperintense cavity within the cord parenchyma, often extending over multiple segments. Sensitivity and specificity exceed 95% (Klekamp J. Neurosurg Rev 2012;35(4):487\u2013502). CT myelography may be used if MRI is contraindicated. Somatosensory evoked potentials can localize functional impairment. Pretest probability is high in patients with Chiari malformation plus upper extremity sensory deficits.","management_principles":"Surgical decompression of the foramen magnum with duraplasty in Chiari-associated cases restores CSF flow and often leads to syrinx collapse (Class I evidence, Level A, AANS guidelines 2018). In idiopathic or post-traumatic syringomyelia, shunting procedures (syringosubarachnoid or syringoperitoneal) can be employed. Medical management is limited to symptomatic therapies for neuropathic pain (e.g., gabapentin) and spasticity (baclofen).","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial MRI at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively is recommended to monitor syrinx regression (AANS 2018). Annual neurologic examinations evaluate for recurrent sensory or motor deficits. Patients should be counseled regarding signs of progression\u2014new pain, weakness, or sensory loss\u2014to prompt re-imaging.","clinical_pearls":"1. Syringomyelia causes dissociated sensory loss (pain and temperature only) due to spinothalamic tract involvement. 2. Chiari I malformation is the most common associated abnormality. 3. MRI is >95% sensitive and specific for detecting syrinx cavities. 4. Ependymal lining disruption differentiates syringomyelia from hydromyelia. 5. Early surgical decompression can halt progression and reduce cavity size.","references":"1. Milhorat TH, Chou MW, Trinidad EM, Kula RW, Mandell M, Wolpert C. Chiari I Malformation Res.
