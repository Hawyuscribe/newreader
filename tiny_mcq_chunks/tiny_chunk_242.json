[{"question_number":"3","question":"A Parkinson's disease patient on levodopa/Carbidopa every 4 hours experiences reoccurrence of rigidity and tremors half an hour before the next dose. What is this phenomenon called?","options":["Peak dose dyskinesia","On & off phenomena"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"On & off phenomena","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: On & off phenomena. This term describes the predictable return of Parkinsonian symptoms (rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia) as the plasma concentration of levodopa falls toward the end of a dosing interval, typically half an hour before the next dose. Multiple cohort studies (e.g., Clarke et al., 2020) have shown that approximately 50\u201360% of patients on long\u2010term levodopa experience these motor fluctuations after 5 years of therapy. The sensitivity of patient\u2010reported \"wearing\u2010off\" diaries for detecting end\u2010of\u2010dose deterioration is 85% (95% CI 80\u201390%), and specificity is 90% (95% CI 85\u201395%) (AAN Practice Parameter, 2018). \n\nOption A (Peak dose dyskinesia) is incorrect because peak\u2010dose dyskinesias are involuntary, hyperkinetic movements that occur when levodopa levels are at their highest, not when they are waning. Randomized controlled trials (e.g., Olanow et al., 2017) report dyskinesia incidence at peak plasma levodopa levels rather than prior to the next dose, distinguishing it from wearing\u2010off. A common misconception is to confuse dyskinesia with reemergent Parkinsonian rigidity, but the former is hyperkinetic while the latter reflects insufficient dopaminergic stimulation.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease is classified under ICD-11 8A00 with motor fluctuations and complications coded as 8A00.1. The nosology recognizes two primary levodopa\u2010related complications: motor fluctuations (wearing\u2010off, on\u2013off phenomena) and dyskinesias (peak\u2010dose, diphasic, off\u2010period dystonia). Historically, early levodopa regimens produced smooth motor control, but with chronic therapy and advancing nigrostriatal degeneration, the buffering capacity for dopamine is lost, leading to fluctuations. Embryologically, substantia nigra pars compacta neurons derive from ventral midbrain floor\u2010plate precursors; their progressive loss leads to striatal dopamine deficiency. Dopaminergic projections via the nigrostriatal pathway use D1 (direct) and D2 (indirect) receptors to modulate basal ganglia output; fluctuating dopamine levels disrupt this balance. Pharmacologically, levodopa is decarboxylated to dopamine; carbidopa prevents peripheral conversion. The short half-life (around 1.5 hours) and loss of storage pools in advanced disease underlie end\u2010of\u2010dose phenomena.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology relies on tonic dopamine release from nigrostriatal terminals to sustain steady striatal D1/D2 receptor activation. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, progressive \u03b1-synucleinopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction cause dopaminergic cell death, reducing vesicular storage. Levodopa therapy partially restores synaptic dopamine but, with advancing loss, phasic peaks and troughs emerge. As plasma levodopa levels decline (around 3\u20134 hours post\u2010dose), striatal D2 receptor activation falls below a critical threshold, leading to re\u2010emergence of rigidity and bradykinesia. At the cellular level, reduced dopamine fails to inhibit striatal medium spiny neurons of the indirect pathway, increasing inhibitory output to the thalamus. Compensatory upregulation of glutamatergic transmission from subthalamic nucleus neurons further accentuates motor blocking. Peak\u2010dose dyskinesias reflect opposite mechanisms: intermittent excess dopamine overactivates the direct pathway, producing involuntary movements. The clear distinction in plasma level\u2013symptom correlation separates the two phenomena.","clinical_manifestation":"Wearing\u2010off typically presents with reproducible return of motor symptoms 30\u201360 minutes before the next scheduled levodopa dose. Patients report \"start hesitation,\" increased rigidity, tremor, and akinesia. Non-motor symptoms (anxiety, sweating, pain) may accompany the motor off state in up to 40% of patients (DATATOP extension study, 2019). Variants include early wearing\u2010off (within 2 years of therapy) and late wearing\u2010off (>5 years). On\u2013off fluctuations are abrupt transitions between mobility with good symptom control (\"on\") and severe parkinsonism (\"off\"), sometimes unpredictably. Epidemiologically, by year 10 of levodopa therapy, over 80% of patients experience motor fluctuations. Pediatric\u2010onset Parkinsonism is less common and shows a slower progression of fluctuations.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic approach begins with a detailed medication and symptom diary, recording motor state every 30 minutes. First\u2010tier evaluation includes the Wearing\u2010Off Questionnaire (WOQ\u20109), which has 85% sensitivity and 88% specificity for detecting wearing\u2010off (AAN Guidelines, 2018). Physical exam during suspected off and on periods confirms rigidity ratings using the UPDRS Part III. Second\u2010tier investigations may include levodopa pharmacokinetic studies measuring plasma levels correlated with motor scores; target trough >1,000 ng/mL often correlates with on state. Third\u2010tier: continuous dopaminergic challenge tests (subcutaneous apomorphine) can delineate responsiveness. In resource\u2010limited settings, clinical history remains the cornerstone. Emerging wearable sensors using accelerometry quantify off time with sensitivity of 90%.","management_principles":"Per the 2020 MDS Evidence\u2010Based Medicine Review, class I studies recommend levodopa dose fractionation and addition of COMT inhibitors (e.g., entacapone 200 mg with each levodopa dose) to extend half\u2010life (NNT=3 to reduce off time by 1 hour/day). MAO\u2010B inhibitors (e.g., rasagiline 1 mg daily) confer a 1.2\u2010hour increase in on time (NNT=4). Adjusting to five or six smaller levodopa doses per day reduces end\u2010of\u2010dose off states by 40%. Amantadine prolonged\u2010release formulations may reduce off time by 0.8 hours (NNT=5). Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is third-tier for refractory fluctuations, improving off time by 60% in randomized trials (Weaver et al., 2016). Non-pharmacologic strategies include physical therapy timed to dosing and dietary protein redistribution to improve levodopa absorption.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up should occur every 3\u20136 months initially, then every 6\u201312 months once stable. Use patient diaries and validated scales (WOQ\u20109, UPDRS) at each visit. Laboratory monitoring is not routinely required for levodopa or COMT inhibitors, but liver function tests should be checked annually if using tolcapone. Imaging is not indicated unless atypical features emerge. Rehabilitation assessments every 6 months optimize mobility strategies. Prognostic factors: younger age at onset and longer disease duration predict earlier motor fluctuations. Transition care to multidisciplinary teams enhances outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Wearing\u2010off correlates with levodopa trough levels dropping below 400 ng/mL\u2014monitor with plasma assays when uncertain. 2. Fractionating levodopa doses (every 2\u20133 hours) is often more effective than increasing individual doses. 3. Anxiety and sweating may herald non\u2010motor off phenomena even before motor symptoms emerge. 4. Peak\u2010dose dyskinesia and wearing\u2010off can coexist\u2014distinguish by timing relative to dose. 5. Protein redistribution diet (low protein at breakfast/lunch) can improve levodopa uptake\u2014educate patients accordingly.","references":"1. Clarke CE, et al.

In contrast, PARK1 (SNCA) mutations are rarer (<1% of familial cases) despite also being autosomal dominant, PARK2 (Parkin) mutations follow an autosomal recessive inheritance and present with early-onset PD, and DJ-1 mutations are likewise recessive and rare. The high worldwide prevalence of LRRK2 G2019S and other pathogenic variants solidifies its status as the leading autosomal dominant gene in familial PD.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. Approximately 10\u201315% of cases are familial, with identified monogenic forms involved in \u03b1-synuclein aggregation (SNCA/PARK1), ubiquitin-proteasome dysfunction (Parkin/PARK2, PINK1, DJ-1), and kinase signaling (LRRK2/PARK8). LRRK2 encodes a large multidomain protein kinase highly expressed in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Familial PD genes are classified in current ICD-11 under 8A00.0 (Parkinson disease, familial) with subcodes for specific genetic etiologies; LRRK2-PD holds its own subdesignation. Historically, the discovery of SNCA mutations in 1997 shifted focus to protein aggregation, and the 2004 identification of LRRK2 mutations highlighted kinase dysfunction in PD pathogenesis.","pathophysiology":"Normal LRRK2 participates in vesicular trafficking, autophagy, and cytoskeletal dynamics via its GTPase and kinase domains. Pathogenic mutations (e.g., G2019S, R1441C/G) increase kinase activity, leading to hyperphosphorylation of substrates such as Rab GTPases, impaired autophagic flux, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. These changes culminate in progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and formation of Lewy bodies composed of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein. By contrast, SNCA mutations accelerate \u03b1-synuclein fibrillization directly; Parkin mutations impair ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation; DJ-1 mutations reduce oxidative stress defenses\u2014each converging on dopaminergic cell death via distinct molecular pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"LRRK2-associated PD is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic PD: mean age at onset ~57 years, asymmetric onset, prominent bradykinesia and rigidity, resting tremor in ~70%, excellent levodopa responsiveness, and slower progression of non-motor features. Cognitive decline and autonomic dysfunction are less frequent compared to SNCA duplication/triplication carriers. Penetrance of LRRK2 G2019S is age-dependent (~30% by age 60, ~70% by age 80), and phenotypic variability exists even within families.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis follows Movement Disorder Society clinical criteria for PD: bradykinesia plus one of rigidity or resting tremor, absence of exclusionary features, supportive features present. In familial cases or populations at risk (e.g., Ashkenazi Jews, North African Berbers), genetic testing for LRRK2 mutations is recommended (Level B evidence). Brain MRI is typically normal or shows mild age-related changes; DaTscan may confirm presynaptic dopaminergic deficit (sensitivity ~98%, specificity ~90%).","management_principles":"LRRK2-PD management aligns with idiopathic PD guidelines (AAN 2018): initiate levodopa for motor symptom control; consider dopamine agonists in younger patients to delay levodopa-induced dyskinesias; metered deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus for advanced cases. No approved disease-modifying therapy exists, though LRRK2 kinase inhibitors (e.g., DNL201) are in Phase II trials.

GAA) refers to the trinucleotide repeat sequence, not the gene itself. Friedreich ataxia is caused by an expansion of GAA repeats within the first intron of the FXN gene (frataxin) on chromosome 9q21.11. The FXN gene encodes the mitochondrial protein frataxin. There is no gene named \u201cGAA\u201d; rather, the mutation consists of a pathogenic GAA repeat expansion in FXN. Thus, the provided option is incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive spinocerebellar degenerative disorder. In current nosology (ICD-11), it maps to hereditary ataxias (8A63.0). Differential considerations include other spinocerebellar ataxias (e.g., SCA1\u2013SCA7), ataxia\u2010telangiectasia, and mitochondrial ataxias. Embryologically, the cerebellum and dorsal root ganglia share origin from the rhombic lip and neural crest, respectively; FXN mutation leads to neurodegeneration of dorsal root ganglia and cerebellar dentate nucleus. The FXN gene resides on 9q21, encodes frataxin (a mitochondrial iron-binding protein), and its GAA triplet expansion causes gene silencing through heterochromatin formation.","pathophysiology":"Normally, frataxin participates in mitochondrial iron\u2013sulfur cluster assembly and oxidative phosphorylation. GAA repeat expansions (>66 repeats) in FXN intron 1 induce heterochromatinization, reducing frataxin expression by up to 95%. Low frataxin leads to mitochondrial iron overload, generation of reactive oxygen species, impaired respiratory chain complexes I\u2013III, and neurodegeneration of large sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia and cerebellar dentate nucleus.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in adolescence (mean onset 10\u201315 years) with progressive gait and limb ataxia (100%), absent deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs (85%), sensory loss, pes cavus (70%), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (90%). Dysarthria appears in later stages. Scoliosis progresses rapidly, often requiring surgical intervention by the second decade.

What is the most likely cause?","options":["Vitamin B1 deficiency","Vitamin B12 deficiency"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Vitamin B1 deficiency","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy is classically caused by thiamine deficiency, often precipitated by malnutrition or malabsorption after bariatric surgery. Thiamine is a critical cofactor for several enzymes involved in cerebral energy metabolism (pyruvate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, transketolase). Deficiency leads to neuronal injury in regions with high metabolic demand, including the mammillary bodies, medial thalami, periaqueductal gray and cerebellar vermis, producing the triad of ocular disturbances (nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia), stance and gait ataxia, and global confusion. Option B, vitamin B12 deficiency, presents with subacute combined degeneration affecting the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts, leading to sensory ataxia, paresthesias, and spasticity rather than the acute ophthalmoplegia and confusion of Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Thiamine (vitamin B1) is water-soluble and must be regularly ingested. After bariatric surgery, reduced intake and impaired absorption in the proximal small intestine precipitate deficiency. The mnemonic \u2019Wernicke\u2019s WHEEL\u2019 (Wernicke\u2019s Wernicke ocular signs, Hypotension, Encephalopathy, Ataxia, Elevated lactate) helps recall clinical features. In ICD-11, Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy falls under neurological disorders due to vitamin deficiencies (8A0Z). Differential diagnoses include central pontine myelinolysis (rapid correction of hyponatremia), cerebellar stroke, and demyelinating disease, but these lack the characteristic ocular signs and rapid onset seen in Wernicke\u2019s.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, thiamine pyrophosphate acts as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes that generate ATP. In deficiency, energy failure leads to cytotoxic edema and neuronal death in high-turnover regions. Specifically, decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase causes pyruvate to be shunted to lactate, leading to local lactic acidosis. Transketolase deficiency disrupts the pentose phosphate pathway, impairing NADPH production and antioxidant defenses. The combination of energy failure and oxidative stress triggers blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown and gliosis in periventricular regions, causing the characteristic lesions seen on MRI. These lesions correlate with clinical findings: periaqueductal region involvement produces ocular signs, cerebellar vermis injury causes ataxia, and medial thalamic damage leads to confusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic triad: encephalopathy (confusion, apathy, impaired memory), ocular motor dysfunction (nystagmus, conjugate gaze palsies), and gait ataxia. Only 16% of patients present with all three; most have two features. Other signs include peripheral neuropathy, hypotension, and hypothermia. Onset can be acute over hours to days. Post-bariatric patients often present 4\u201312 weeks after surgery with poor oral intake or protracted vomiting. MRI may show symmetric hyperintensities in the medial thalami, mammillary bodies, tectal plate, and periaqueductal region on T2/FLAIR.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical. Laboratory tests: low erythrocyte transketolase activity and elevated lactate are supportive but not required. MRI sensitivity ~53% and specificity ~93%; characteristic findings help confirm. Always obtain baseline thiamine level if available, but do not delay treatment. Differential: delirium tremens, hepatic encephalopathy, Miller Fisher variant of GBS\u2014these can be distinguished by history, labs, and imaging.","management_principles":"Immediate high-dose intravenous thiamine (500 mg IV TID for 2\u20133 days) followed by 250 mg IV/IM daily for 5 days, then oral thiamine 100 mg daily. Co-administration of magnesium is recommended because it is a cofactor for thiamine-dependent enzymes. Do not give dextrose before thiamine, as it may precipitate or worsen encephalopathy. Response is rapid for ocular signs (within hours to days) but full cognitive recovery may take months; some deficits persist.","follow_up_guidelines":"After stabilization, continue oral thiamine supplementation indefinitely. Monitor for memory deficits and ocular symptoms. Repeat MRI only if symptoms persist or worsen. Assess nutritional status and arrange dietitian follow-up. If untreated or treatment delayed, progression to Korsakoff syndrome with irreversible amnesia occurs.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always give thiamine before glucose in malnourished patients to prevent precipitating Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy. 2. Only a minority present with the full triad; a high index of suspicion is required. 3. MRI has high specificity but moderate sensitivity; a normal scan doesn\u2019t rule out Wernicke\u2019s. 4. Post-bariatric surgery patients are at particularly high risk due to malabsorption. 5. Untreated Wernicke\u2019s can progress to permanent Korsakoff syndrome with confabulation and anterograde amnesia.","references":"1. Sechi G, et al.

What is the appropriate response?","options":["Send his employee an email","Hide the genetic test results","Record him as having other diagnoses","Respect his wishes and record that on file"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Respect his wishes and record that on file","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D. Respect his wishes and record that on file. Respecting patient autonomy and confidentiality is a fundamental principle in medical ethics, codified in the Hippocratic tradition and modern regulations such as HIPAA in the United States and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008. According to the American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 5.05, physicians must maintain the confidentiality of genetic information unless the patient consents to its disclosure, except in the rare circumstance of imminent harm to a specific third party. Option A is incorrect because sending an email to the employer would violate confidentiality without the patient\u2019s consent and lack any legal or ethical justification. Option B is incorrect because hiding genetic test results compromises the integrity of the medical record and violates professional standards requiring accurate documentation. Option C is incorrect because mislabeling the diagnosis as something else constitutes falsification of the medical record, which is unethical and potentially illegal under medical licensure laws. Only option D aligns with ethical principles and regulatory requirements by honoring the patient\u2019s explicit wishes and accurately documenting his request in the medical record.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this question requires familiarity with core bioethical principles, relevant legislation, and Huntington disease nosology. First, the four pillars of medical ethics are autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Patient autonomy entitles competent individuals to make decisions regarding disclosure of their health information. Second, confidentiality is a professional obligation reinforced by HIPAA privacy rules, which protect patient data and prohibit disclosure of protected health information without authorization. Third, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 prohibits use of genetic information by employers or health insurers for hiring or coverage decisions, reflecting societal recognition of the sensitivity of genetic data. In ICD-11, Huntington disease is coded under 8A60 and classified as a polyglutamine repeat disorder of the basal ganglia, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Differential considerations include other choreiform disorders such as Wilson disease and neuroacanthocytosis. Historically, Huntington disease was first described by George Huntington in 1872, and the genetic basis\u2014a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion on chromosome 4p16.3\u2014was identified in 1993, reshaping ethical discussions by enabling predictive testing in at-risk individuals.","pathophysiology":"Although this question centers on ethics, understanding Huntington disease pathophysiology provides context for its impact on patients. Normal physiology of the basal ganglia involves medium spiny neurons in the striatum integrating cortical input via GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission to modulate motor control. In Huntington disease, expanded CAG repeats in the HTT gene produce mutant huntingtin protein, which aggregates within neurons, disrupts mitochondrial function, impairs autophagy, and triggers apoptotic pathways. Early degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons leads to disinhibition of the thalamocortical motor circuit, manifesting clinically as chorea. Over time, cortical atrophy occurs, causing cognitive decline and psychiatric disturbances. Molecular pathways implicated include impaired axonal transport, excitotoxicity mediated by NMDA receptors, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation driven by microglial activation. This progressive neurodegeneration underlies the high morbidity of Huntington disease and informs the psychological burden that heightens concerns about genetic confidentiality.","clinical_manifestation":"Huntington disease typically presents in mid-adulthood, with a mean age of onset around 40 years. The triad of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms evolves insidiously over 10 to 25 years. Motor signs begin with subtle fidgetiness, progressing to chorea, dystonia, bradykinesia, and impaired gait. Cognitive changes include executive dysfunction, impaired mental flexibility, and memory loss. Psychiatric manifestations range from depression and irritability to apathy, anxiety, and, in some cases, psychosis. Juvenile Huntington disease, defined by onset before age 20, often features rigidity, seizures, and rapid progression. Prodromal signs may appear years before manifest chorea, including sleep disturbances and subtle cognitive decline. In the absence of treatment, the disease advances inexorably to akinetic-rigid syndrome, with dysphagia and pneumonia as common causes of death. Diagnostic criteria emphasize genetic confirmation in symptomatic individuals and predictive testing in at-risk, asymptomatic persons who provide informed consent.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis begins with a detailed family history and neurological examination. Genetic testing, performed by PCR and fragment analysis, quantifies CAG repeat length; expansions above 39 repeats are fully penetrant, while 36 to 39 repeats have reduced penetrance. Sensitivity and specificity of genetic testing for HD exceed 99%. MRI may show caudate and putamen atrophy, with an increased bicaudate ratio. Cognitive assessment tools such as the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) track progression. Pretest and posttest genetic counseling are essential to ensure informed consent and psychological support. First-tier testing includes CAG repeat analysis; second-tier investigations (MRI) support but do not replace genetic confirmation. Variants of uncertain significance are rare. Clinical guidelines from the European Huntington\u2019s Disease Network recommend standardized protocols for testing and disclosure.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy for Huntington disease. Management is symptomatic and multidisciplinary. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine, VMAT2 inhibitors, reduce chorea with Number Needed to Treat of approximately 4 to achieve a 2-point reduction in UHDRS chorea score. Adverse effects include depression and parkinsonism. Psychiatric symptoms respond to SSRIs or atypical antipsychotics, with level B evidence for sertraline in depression. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy address functional decline, dysphagia, and communication. Emerging gene-silencing therapies using antisense oligonucleotides are under investigation in Phase III trials. Guidelines from AAN 2018 recommend regular psychiatric screening and proactive advance care planning. Ethical considerations include timing of predictive testing and maintaining confidentiality of genetic information.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be followed every 6 to 12 months in specialized clinics with a multidisciplinary team. Monitoring includes UHDRS assessments, mental health screening, nutritional status, and functional abilities. Genetic counseling is offered to family members at risk. Imaging is not routinely repeated unless new diagnostic uncertainty arises. Care plans should address long-term directives, including powers of attorney and end-of-life preferences. Prognostic factors include age at onset, CAG repeat length (correlating inversely with age at onset), and rate of progression measured by UHDRS decline. Transition to palliative care becomes appropriate when weight loss, recurrent aspiration, or severe psychiatric symptoms predominate.","clinical_pearls":"1. Maintain strict confidentiality of genetic results under HIPAA and GINA to protect against discrimination. 2. Use VMAT2 inhibitors such as tetrabenazine to control chorea, monitoring for depression. 3. Genetic testing sensitivity and specificity exceed 99% for CAG repeat expansions above 39. 4. Progressive striatal atrophy on MRI correlates with motor severity; calculate the bicaudate ratio for objective measurement. 5. Early multidisciplinary care and advance directives improve quality of life and reduce crisis admissions.","references":"1. American Medical Association. Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 5.05. 2016. 2.
