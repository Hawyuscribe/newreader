The patient\u2019s headache features\u2014unilateral, pulsatile pain lasting 4\u201372 hours, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea\u2014and the familial pattern without preceding aura are classic for migraine without aura (ICHD-3, G43.0). Option A (Menstrual migraine) requires temporal association with menses (2 days before to 3 days after onset, \u22652 of 3 cycles), which is not specified for the patient herself. Option C (Tension-type headache) lacks photophobia and nausea. Option D (Cluster headache) presents with autonomic features (lacrimation, nasal congestion) and shorter duration (15\u2013180 minutes) with circadian periodicity, not described here.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine without aura is a primary headache disorder subclassified under ICHD-3 G43.0. Differential includes tension-type headache (G44.2), cluster headache (G44.0), and secondary headaches like sinusitis. Familial aggregation occurs in up to 34% of first-degree relatives. The condition likely involves genetic variants in ion channels (CACNA1A, SCN1A) leading to cortical hyperexcitability. Embryologically, the trigeminovascular system arises from the neural crest. Classification has evolved from simple vs. classical migraine to episodic vs. chronic subtypes, based on frequency. The absence of aura distinguishes it pathophysiologically from aura migraine (spreading cortical depression without clinical signs).","pathophysiology":"Baseline physiology involves stable neurovascular coupling. In migraine without aura, no overt cortical spreading depression occurs; instead, sensitization of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis leads to central and peripheral sensitization. CGRP release from trigeminal afferents causes dural vasodilation and neurogenic inflammation. Ion channel dysfunction (e.g., increased Nav1.7 activity) lowers the threshold for nociceptive firing. Hormonal and genetic factors modulate receptor expression (5-HT1B/1D), which is why triptans (5-HT1B/1D agonists) are effective abortive agents. The absence of aura suggests downstream sensitization without the cortical spreading depression event seen in migraine with aura.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical migraine without aura involves attacks lasting 4\u201372 hours, unilateral throbbing pain, moderate to severe intensity, aggravated by routine activity, with associated nausea (70%), photophobia (90%), and phonophobia (80%). Prevalence is 17% in women and 6% in men. Familial patterns are common. Prodromal symptoms (yawning, mood changes) occur in 30% of patients. Variants include vestibular migraine (dizziness), abdominal migraine (pediatric), and hemiplegic migraine (motor weakness). Natural history: frequency peaks in the 30s and may remit after menopause in women.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical based on ICHD-3 criteria: \u22655 attacks fulfilling criteria. No imaging needed in typical presentations. Brain MRI may be considered if headache pattern changes or focal neurological signs present. Sensitivity of clinical criteria is ~95% and specificity ~80%. Pre-test probability in this familial context is high (>90%). No routine lab tests are indicated. In special populations (adolescent girls), hormonal triggers should be assessed.","management_principles":"First-line abortive therapy includes NSAIDs (ibuprofen 400\u2013600 mg, NNT=2.5) and triptans (sumatriptan 50\u2013100 mg, NNT=2.1). Prophylaxis criteria: \u22654 attacks/month or disabling episodes; first-line agents include propranolol (40\u2013240 mg/day, Level A), amitriptyline (25\u2013150 mg at bedtime, Level B), and topiramate (50\u2013100 mg/day, Level A) outside of pregnancy. Lifestyle modifications: sleep hygiene, regular meals, hydration. Avoid medication overuse (limit triptan use to <10 days/month).","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess response after 2\u20133 months of prophylaxis. Monitor headache diaries for frequency, severity, and duration. Evaluate side effects (e.g., propranolol-induced fatigue, topiramate-induced cognitive slowing). Adjust therapy based on efficacy (\u226550% reduction in attacks) and tolerability. In refractory cases, consider CGRP monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab). Review for medication overuse headache and counsel accordingly.","clinical_pearls":"1. Photophobia and phonophobia distinguish migraine from tension-type headache. 2.

What is your next step in management?","options":["Acetazolamide","Topiramate","VP shunt","Lumbar puncture"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Acetazolamide","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, reduces CSF production by approximately 50% within four weeks and is recommended as first-line therapy in about 70\u201380% of patients diagnosed with IIH. The landmark IIH Treatment Trial (IIHTT) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in perimetric mean deviation at six months compared to placebo (p<0.001), and both American Academy of Neurology and North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society guidelines endorse acetazolamide as initial management. Pathophysiologically, inhibition of enzyme activity at choroid plexus epithelial cells leads to decreased bicarbonate transport and reduced CSF formation. A common misconception is that weight loss alone suffices to normalize intracranial pressure, whereas optimal outcomes require combined pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions.\n\nOption B: Topiramate exhibits weak carbonic anhydrase inhibition and induces weight loss but lacks robust randomized trial evidence in IIH. It may be considered off-label for patients intolerant of acetazolamide or with concomitant migraine disorders. Small observational studies (n\u224830 patients) have shown modest ICP reduction (mean decrease 10\u2009cm H\u2082O), yet cognitive side effects and paresthesias limit its utility as first-line therapy.\n\nOption C: Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting surgically diverts CSF to relieve pressure and is reserved for fulminant cases or refractory vision loss after maximal medical therapy. Shunt complications occur in up to 30% within two years, including infection and mechanical failure, making it a tertiary option rather than next step.\n\nOption D: Diagnostic lumbar puncture measures opening pressure and temporarily lowers intracranial pressure but provides only short-term relief (<48 hours). It is diagnostic rather than therapeutic long term and carries headache risk in 20\u201330% of patients. It is not preferred as definitive management.","conceptual_foundation":"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension arises when elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure develops within a rigid cranial vault without identifiable mass or hydrocephalus. Anatomical structures central to CSF dynamics include the choroid plexus located in lateral, third, and fourth ventricles, the arachnoid granulations along the superior sagittal sinus, the optic nerve sheath, and dural venous sinuses. Embryologically, the neural tube gives rise to the ventricular system by week four of gestation; choroidal villi differentiate by week twelve to produce CSF. Normally, CSF is generated at 20\u2009mL/hour with total volume turnover every 6\u20137 hours under Monro-Kellie doctrine constraints, maintaining intracranial pressure between 7 and 15\u2009mm\u2009Hg. Related neurological syndromes include normal pressure hydrocephalus, pseudotumor cerebri in pediatric populations, and secondary intracranial hypertension from venous sinus thrombosis. Historically, Heinrich Quincke first described lumbar puncture in 1891, while Walter Dandy in 1937 clarified CSF production mechanisms. Key anatomical landmarks such as the foramen of Monro, tentorium cerebelli, and sella turcica guide both imaging interpretation and surgical approaches. Recognition of optic disc elevation at the fundus is critical, reflecting papilledema due to retrograde axoplasmic stasis along the optic nerve.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, acetazolamide targets carbonic anhydrase II in choroid plexus epithelial cells, blocking hydration of carbon dioxide and secretion of bicarbonate, thereby reducing CSF formation by up to 50%. Intracellular pH shifts alter sodium and chloride exchange via Na\u207a/H\u207a and Cl\u207b/HCO\u2083\u207b cotransporters. Cellular astrocyte swelling from hyperosmolar interstitial fluid exacerbates intracranial pressure. Genetic predisposition includes rare mutations in AQP4 and CA2 genes with autosomal dominant or polygenic inheritance patterns. Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 have been detected at elevated levels in CSF of affected patients, suggesting a low-grade immune response. Metabolic demand rises when compensatory venous outflow obstruction impairs oxidative phosphorylation, depleting ATP in glial cells. Over days to weeks, maladaptive remodeling of arachnoid villi reduces CSF absorption capacity, and compliance curves shift upward. Collateral venous channels develop slowly but cannot fully offset raised intracranial pressure. Compensatory mechanisms such as increased spinal CSF compliance and decreased cerebral blood volume transiently mitigate pressure but fail if underlying dynamics remain uncorrected.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with IIH typically present between ages 15 and 45, with a female predominance of approximately 9:1. Symptom onset is often insidious over two to four weeks, beginning with daily headaches described as throbbing or pressure-type peaking in the morning. Associated symptoms include transient visual obscurations lasting seconds in up to 68% of cases, pulsatile tinnitus in 48%, and binocular diplopia from sixth nerve palsy in 12\u201315%. Complete neurological examination reveals bilateral papilledema on funduscopic exam; visual field testing shows enlarged blind spots and peripheral constriction. Pediatric cases may demonstrate severe headache with vomiting, whereas elderly patients present more subtly with nonspecific cognitive changes. Severity grading via Fris\u00e9n scale (grades I\u2013V) correlates disc elevation with visual prognosis. Red flags include rapid vision loss, cranial nerve III palsy, or altered mental status, which may indicate venous sinus thrombosis. Without treatment, natural history includes progressive optic atrophy in 10\u201315% leading to permanent visual impairment over 6\u201324 months.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation begins with detailed history and funduscopic examination. First-line imaging is contrast-enhanced MRI brain with venography sequences; sensitivity for detecting transverse sinus stenosis approaches 80%, specificity 90%. A normal imaging study without mass or hydrocephalus plus venous sinus narrowing supports IIH. Following imaging, diagnostic lumbar puncture measures opening pressure with patient in lateral decubitus; an opening pressure >25\u2009cm H\u2082O in adults is diagnostic (sensitivity 92%, specificity 89%). CSF analysis shows normal cell count (0\u20135 cells/mm\u00b3), glucose 45\u201380\u2009mg/dL, protein 15\u201345\u2009mg/dL. Second-line studies include optical coherence tomography to quantify retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and automated perimetry to monitor field defects. Rarely, digital subtraction angiography is used if MRV results are equivocal. Electrophysiological tests such as visual evoked potentials may show delayed P100 latencies. Differential diagnoses include cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, hydrocephalus ex vacuo, and malignant hypertension; they are distinguished by MRI findings, CSF composition, and systemic blood pressure measurements.","management_principles":"First-line medical therapy consists of acetazolamide starting at 500\u2009mg orally twice daily, titrated up to 2\u2009g per day in divided doses as tolerated. A loading dose of 1\u2009g may be given to rapidly reduce ICP in acute presentations. Maintenance regimens often average 1.5\u2009g daily. Second-line options include topiramate 25\u2013100\u2009mg twice daily in patients with comorbid migraine or acetazolamide intolerance. Third-line agents such as furosemide 20\u201340\u2009mg daily may be added for refractory cases. Drug interactions include increased lithium levels and hypokalemia risk with diuretics. Non-pharmacological measures include structured weight loss programs achieving at least a 5\u201310% body weight reduction, which lowers CSF pressure by up to 25%. Surgical interventions, indicated for progressive vision loss or intractable headache, include optic nerve sheath fenestration with 70% success in stabilizing vision and VP shunt placement with two\u2010year patency rates around 60%. Monitoring protocols require quarterly visual field testing and biannual fundoscopic exams. Acetazolamide side effects such as paresthesias and metabolic acidosis are managed by dose adjustment. In pregnancy, acetazolamide at 250\u2009mg twice daily is considered safe after first trimester.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be reevaluated at two to four weeks after treatment initiation, then every three months until stable. Clinical monitoring includes headache diaries, serial visual field testing with Humphrey perimetry targeting a mean deviation improvement of \u22652\u2009dB, and fundoscopic examination seeking resolution of papilledema. Imaging surveillance with MRV is repeated at six-month intervals or sooner if symptoms worsen. Laboratory monitoring includes serum electrolytes and bicarbonate levels monthly for carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy. Long-term complications such as persistent visual field deficits occur in 10\u201315% over five years. Prognosis shows stabilization of vision in 85% at one year and maintained at five years with adherence. Rehabilitation may involve vestibular therapy for persistent balance issues and cognitive therapy for headache sequelae. Patient education addresses adherence, weight management, and symptom recognition. Driving restrictions apply only if visual acuity or fields fall below legal limits. Support resources include IIH patient advocacy networks and neuro-ophthalmology societies for community and guidance.","clinical_pearls":"1. Acetazolamide remains first-line; doses \u22651.5\u2009g/day yield maximal CSF reduction. 2. Weight loss \u22655% correlates with a 30% drop in ICP. 3. Papilledema grade on Fris\u00e9n scale predicts visual outcome. 4. Pulsatile tinnitus often precedes diplopia by weeks. 5. MRV reveals transverse sinus stenosis in up to 90% of IIH cases. 6. Avoid overuse of lumbar punctures due to post-LP headache risk of 25%. 7. VP shunt complications occur in nearly one-third within two years. 8.

Menstrual migraine is a specific subtype of migraine without aura, triggered by cyclical estrogen withdrawal in the perimenstrual period, classified as pure menstrual migraine (PMM) or menstrually related migraine (MRM). Diagnostic criteria require diary documentation over three cycles. Differential diagnoses include TTH, cluster headache, and secondary headaches due to hormonal contraceptives or withdrawal.","pathophysiology":"Normal menstrual cycle involves rising and falling estrogen levels. In the late luteal phase, estrogen withdrawal increases cortical excitability and upregulates calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release in trigeminovascular pathways (Christensen et al., 2019). Estrogen modulates serotonin synthesis and receptor expression; withdrawal lowers serotonin tone, facilitating nociceptive transmission in trigeminal ganglia. CGRP binds to its receptor on smooth muscle and mast cells, causing vasodilation and neurogenic inflammation in dura mater. These molecular events precipitate the sterile inflammatory cascade underlying migraine pain during menstruation.","clinical_manifestation":"Menstrual migraine presents as unilateral, pulsatile moderate to severe headache attacks lasting 4\u201372 hours, often accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Attacks consistently occur perimenstrually (day \u22122 to +3 of menstruation) in at least two of three cycles. Women may also experience prodromal symptoms such as mood changes, food cravings, and neck stiffness. Menstrual attacks tend to be longer, more severe, and less responsive to acute therapy compared to non-menstrual attacks, with reported durations up to 72 hours and increased rates of recurrence (Martin et al., 2016).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on a 3-month headache diary documenting timing, duration, and associated symptoms. ICHD-3 criteria require at least two perimenstrual attacks fulfilling migraine without aura criteria and absence of attacks outside this window for PMM. Laboratory and imaging studies are typically normal; head MRI is reserved for atypical features or red flags. Differential excludes secondary causes such as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome or intracranial mass. A high index of suspicion and diary confirmation are key to avoid misclassification.","management_principles":"Acute treatment includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen 500 mg twice daily, initiated 2 days prior to expected menses and continued for 5\u20137 days (AAN Level A evidence). Triptans (e.g., frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice daily) can be used perimenstrually for breakthrough attacks. Hormonal stabilization via continuous combined estrogen\u2013progestin oral contraceptives may reduce attack frequency in MRM (Level B). Non-pharmacological strategies include magnesium supplementation (400 mg daily) and lifestyle modifications to maintain sleep, hydration, and stress control.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3\u20136 months assess headache frequency, severity, treatment response, and medication overuse. Diary review guides adjustment of acute and preventive regimens. Monitor NSAID or triptan overuse to prevent medication-overuse headache. In women on hormonal therapy, evaluate for cardiovascular risk factors annually. Referral to a headache specialist is recommended if attacks exceed eight per month or if there is poor treatment response after two adequate trials.","clinical_pearls":"1. Menstrual migraine attacks are often longer and less responsive to treatment than non-menstrual attacks\u2014plan early and prolonged prophylaxis. 2. A 3-month headache diary is essential for accurate diagnosis and prevents misclassification as TTH. 3. NSAID mini-prophylaxis (naproxen) started premenstrually has Level A evidence for reducing menstrual migraine frequency. 4. Continuous hormonal contraception can stabilize estrogen levels and reduce menstrually related attacks\u2014consider after ruling out contraindications. 5. Monitor for medication-overuse headache when using daily perimenstrual acute agents\u2014limit triptan days to <10 per month.","references":"1. Ailani J, Burch R, Robbins M.
