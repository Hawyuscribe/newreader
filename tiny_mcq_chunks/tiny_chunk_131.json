It can present as asymptomatic, meningovascular, parenchymatous (general paresis, tabes dorsalis) or ocular involvement. The Argyll Robertson pupil arises from dorsal midbrain lesions. Neurosyphilis is classified under ICD-11 code 1A60.0.","pathophysiology":"Treponema pallidum invades the meninges and parenchyma, causing granulomatous inflammation and microvascular endarteritis. In tabes dorsalis, dorsal column demyelination leads to sensory ataxia; in general paresis, cortical neuron loss leads to psychiatric and cognitive decline.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Mucromycosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Mucromycosis","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A (Mucromycosis). Rhinocerebral mucormycosis classically occurs in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, particularly in the setting of ketoacidosis, and often presents initially as sinusitis with rapid progression to orbital and intracranial involvement leading to focal neurological deficits. Multiple case series and retrospective reviews (Spellberg et al. 2005 [1], Roden et al. 2005 [2]) report that over 70% of rhinocerebral mucormycosis cases occur in diabetic patients. The characteristic angioinvasive nature of the Mucorales causes vessel thrombosis and tissue necrosis, accounting for the rapid neurological deterioration seen clinically. No alternative diagnoses are more consistent with this presentation in a diabetic with sinusitis and focal deficits, making mucormycosis the definitive diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a fulminant fungal infection due to members of the order Mucorales (including Rhizopus and Mucor species). In the 2019 WHO fungal classification, Mucorales are placed within the class Mucoromycetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis creates an iron-rich milieu and impairs neutrophil chemotaxis and oxidative burst, predisposing to Mucorales proliferation. Historically described by Paltauf in 1885 [3], the disease was later linked to diabetes in the mid-20th century. The infection begins in the nasal turbinates or paranasal sinuses, then spreads along the ethmoidal and sphenoidal vessels to the orbit and brain. Neurologically, involvement of cranial nerves II\u2013VI produces ophthalmoplegia, vision loss, and facial numbness. The cavernous sinus may thrombose, leading to stroke syndromes. On a molecular level, the fungal spore coat protein CotH binds host GRP78 on endothelial cells, facilitating angioinvasion (Cohen et al. 2011 [4]).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, macrophages and neutrophils rapidly clear inhaled fungal spores. In diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia and acidosis lead to decreased phagocytic function and elevated free iron, which Mucorales exploit via high-affinity iron permeases. The spores germinate into hyphae that invade blood vessel walls, eliciting endothelial damage, thrombosis, and ischemic necrosis of surrounding tissue. Acidosis further increases expression of host endothelial GRP78, enhancing fungal adhesion (Chamilos et al. 2008 [5]). The result is rapid spread from sinuses to orbit and brain along neurovascular bundles, causing infarction of cranial nerves, brain parenchyma, and manifesting as focal deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present with unilateral facial pain, headache, nasal congestion, and black eschar on the nasal turbinates or palate. Ophthalmic signs include periorbital swelling, proptosis, ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia from cranial nerve III, IV, and VI involvement. Vision loss occurs in >50% of cases (Prabhu & Patel 2004 [6]). Intracranial extension can lead to decreased consciousness, hemiparesis, or seizures. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis is 7\u201310 days, highlighting its fulminant course.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes contrast-enhanced MRI of brain and orbits, which shows non-enhancing devitalized tissue (\u2018black turbinate sign\u2019) with dural enhancement. CT of sinuses reveals bony destruction. Definitive diagnosis requires nasal endoscopy with biopsy demonstrating broad, non-septate hyphae branching at right angles on microscopy and culture on Sabouraud agar. Tissue fungal burden quantification by qPCR shows sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 95% (Millon et al. 2016 [7]). Iron studies and HbA1c assess host risk factors. Serum PCR assays for Mucorales have emerging utility (Millon et al. 2016 [7]).","management_principles":"Prompt surgical debridement of necrotic tissue combined with antifungal therapy is the standard of care. Liposomal amphotericin B at 5\u201310 mg/kg/day is first-line (IDSA 2019 [8]; AII) with nephrotoxicity risk requiring renal monitoring. Posaconazole or isavuconazole serve as salvage or step-down therapy (Grade B; Maertens et al. 2009 [9]). Correction of acidosis and hyperglycemia is essential. Adjunctive therapies like hyperbaric oxygen have class IIb evidence (Cornely et al. 2014 [10]).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require serial MRI every 1\u20132 weeks to monitor residual disease (AIII). Renal function tests, electrolytes, and complete blood counts should be checked twice weekly during amphotericin therapy. After stabilization, transition to oral isavuconazole for at least 6\u20138 weeks is recommended. Monitor for relapse clinically and via imaging for at least 12 months post-treatment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Rhino-cerebral mucormycosis often presents with black eschar on nasal mucosa\u2014a surgical emergency. 2. Non-septate hyphae with right-angle branching on biopsy are pathognomonic. 3. Diabetes with ketoacidosis is the most common predisposing factor\u2014correct metabolic derangements urgently. 4. Liposomal amphotericin B is preferred due to reduced nephrotoxicity; monitor renal function closely. 5.

What will you do next?","options":["Blood culture","CT without contrast","CT with contrast","LP"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"CT with contrast","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Blood culture yields relevant pathogen identification in 70\u201380% of infective endocarditis cases and guides antibiotic choice, but it fails to localize intracranial lesions. In congenital right-to-left shunts, septic emboli bypass pulmonary filtration, seeding brain parenchyma. Delaying neuroimaging for culture results risks rapid neurological deterioration.\n\nOption B: Noncontrast head CT can quickly screen for hemorrhage (sensitivity ~90%) or large mass effect but often misses early abscess ring enhancement and small lesions under 1 cm. In patients with fever and focal deficits, up to 60% of abscesses are not visible without contrast. Noncontrast scans carry a high false-negative rate in early cerebritis.\n\nOption C: Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI demonstrates characteristic ring-enhancing lesions with central hypodensity, perilesional edema, and capsule formation by day 5\u201310 of abscess evolution (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). In congenital heart disease, right-to-left shunts seed bacteria directly, forming abscess cavities that require prompt imaging to plan neurosurgical aspiration and targeted antibiotic therapy.\n\nOption D: Lumbar puncture is contraindicated when focal mass lesions are suspected; opening pressure may exceed 200 mm H\u2082O and risk herniation. LP yields nonspecific findings in brain abscess (mild pleocytosis, elevated protein) and may delay definitive imaging and intervention. Current guidelines strongly discourage LP before contrast imaging in focal febrile deficits.","conceptual_foundation":"Brain abscess formation involves gray\u2013white junction where microvascular caliber change traps septic emboli. Key regions include frontal lobe (30\u201340% of cases) supplied by anterior cerebral artery branches, temporal lobe (20\u201330%) via middle cerebral artery, and cerebellum (15%) via posterior circulation. The blood\u2013brain barrier\u2019s endothelial tight junctions normally exclude pathogens; in early cerebritis, local capillary permeability increases via VEGF and cytokine release. Embryologically, septation of heart chambers creates structures that, if malformed, allow right-to-left shunt: patent foramen ovale, tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus. These anomalies bypass pulmonary filtration of bacteria. Historically, brain abscess mortality exceeded 80% in pre-antibiotic era; modern imaging and antibiotics reduced it to <10%. Landmarks such as the basal cisterns, lateral ventricles, and falx cerebri guide neurosurgical approaches. Recognition of ring-enhancing lesions dates to the 1970s CT era, with MRI further refining abscess capsule visualization. Understanding cortical watershed zones and bridging veins is critical for neurosurgical aspiration planning.","pathophysiology":"Septic emboli sequestered in cerebral microvasculature release bacterial endotoxins (lipoteichoic acid in gram-positive, lipopolysaccharide in gram-negative) that activate TLR2 and TLR4 on microglia. This triggers NF-\u03baB signaling, upregulating proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6. Neutrophils migrate via CXCL8 gradients, forming a purulent core. Astrocyte activation and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases degrade extracellular matrix, facilitating capsule formation between days 7\u201314. Genetic predisposition includes NOD2 variants reducing bacterial clearance; familial immune defects (e.g., chronic granulomatous disease with NADPH oxidase mutations) heighten risk. Metabolic demands escalate local anaerobic glycolysis, generating lactate. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 promotes angiogenesis but leaky neovessels exacerbate vasogenic edema. Compensatory cerebrospinal fluid shifts and contralateral hemisphere compliance initially mitigate intracranial pressure rise, but decompensation yields herniation if untreated. Time course: initial cerebritis (days 1\u20133), early capsule (days 4\u20139), late capsule (>10 days).","clinical_manifestation":"Onset: headache and fever appear over 3\u20137 days, intensifying as capsule forms. Peak mass effect with raised ICP manifests 7\u201314 days after seeding. Neurological exam reveals contralateral hemiparesis (upper motor neuron signs, Babinski positive), focal cortical signs (aphasia if dominant hemisphere), and possible seizures (approximately 25% incidence). In pediatrics, irritability and vomiting predominate; in elderly, confusion and altered mental status. Males slightly more affected (60%). Systemic signs include leukocytosis (WBC 12\u201318\u00d710\u2079/L) and elevated CRP (>50 mg/L). Severity graded by Glasgow Coma Scale: 13\u201315 mild, 9\u201312 moderate, \u22648 severe. Red flags: rapid focal deficit progression, papilledema, bradycardia with hypertension (Cushing triad). Without intervention, natural history leads to abscess rupture (25% risk), ventriculitis, and mortality >50% within 30 days.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Stabilize airway and hemodynamics. Step 2: Immediate contrast-enhanced brain imaging. Sensitivity CT with contrast ~95%, specificity ~90%; MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging sensitivity 99%. If MRI unavailable within 1 hour, perform CT with 100 mL nonionic contrast at 3 mL/s. Step 3: Blood cultures x3 sets (at least two positive sets define bacteremia). Step 4: Neurosurgical consultation for stereotactic aspiration; aspirate culture positivity ~85%. CSF analysis is deferred if mass effect suspected.

Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite, is the most common cause when CD4 counts fall below 100 cells/\u03bcL. Other considerations include primary CNS lymphoma and fungal abscesses, but these have different radiographic characteristics (e.g., solitary lesions with subependymal spread for lymphoma) and clinical courses. The WHO ICD-11 classifies cerebral toxoplasmosis under 'B58.2', and the DSM-5-TR includes HIV-related neuroinfectious complications under 'Secondary Neurocognitive Disorders'. Historically, before effective ART, toxoplasmosis was a leading cause of neurologic morbidity in AIDS; its incidence has declined but remains significant in patients with low CD4 counts. Neuroanatomically, lesions often localize at the corticomedullary junction due to watershed perfusion patterns. T. gondii invades host cells, forms tissue cysts, and elicits a host inflammatory response, which appears radiographically as ring enhancement due to breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier.","pathophysiology":"Normal host defense against T. gondii relies on cell-mediated immunity, particularly CD4+ T-cells producing interferon-gamma. In HIV, CD4 depletion impairs activation of macrophages and microglia, allowing reactivation of latent tissue cysts. Tachyzoites proliferate and destroy glial cells, eliciting necrosis surrounded by reactive astrocytes and neovascularization. The inflammatory response disrupts the blood\u2013brain barrier, leading to contrast enhancement. Sulfadiazine inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, while pyrimethamine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase in the parasite; combined with leucovorin, they reverse folate depletion in the host.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with headache (80%), focal neurologic deficits (60\u201370%), and seizures (30\u201340%); fever is less common. Onset is subacute over days to weeks. Single lesions account for about 30% of cases, often at the corticomedullary junction. Without treatment, lesions enlarge, causing increased intracranial pressure, herniation, and death. Diagnosis requires correlation of clinical, radiographic, and serologic data; Toxoplasma IgG is positive in >90% of affected individuals.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes MRI with contrast to characterize lesions. Empiric anti-toxoplasma therapy is initiated in patients with typical findings. Clinical and radiologic reassessment at 10\u201314 days is recommended: improvement confirms the diagnosis. If no response, consider stereotactic brain biopsy to evaluate for lymphoma or other etiologies. CSF studies are not diagnostic for toxoplasmosis.","management_principles":"Guidelines recommend pyrimethamine 200 mg loading dose then 50\u201375 mg daily plus sulfadiazine 1\u20131.5 g every six hours, with leucovorin 10\u201325 mg daily for 6 weeks induction, followed by maintenance until CD4 >200 for \u22656 months. Adverse effects include bone marrow suppression (monitor CBC weekly), crystalluria (ensure hydration), and hypersensitivity. Alternative regimens include clindamycin or atovaquone for sulfa-allergic patients.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess clinically and with MRI at 2 weeks; radiographic reduction in lesion size by \u226525% supports the diagnosis. Continue maintenance therapy until immune reconstitution on ART (CD4 >200 for 6 months). Monitor CBC, renal, and hepatic function every 2\u20134 weeks. Educate patients on adherence and signs of relapse such as headache or focal deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1. Empiric toxo therapy is indicated for typical MRI findings in HIV with CD4 <100. 2. LP is contraindicated with ring-enhancing lesions due to herniation risk. 3. Lack of improvement after 2 weeks of therapy warrants biopsy. 4. Sulfadiazine requires alkalinized urine to prevent crystalluria. 5. MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting early lesions.","references":"1. Antinori A, et al.
