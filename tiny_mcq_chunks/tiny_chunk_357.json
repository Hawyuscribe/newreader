Electrical myotonia may be seen due to membrane instability from glycogen-filled vacuoles. No other options are presented.","conceptual_foundation":"Infantile Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. It is designated under ICD-11 8C21. Presentation includes \u2018floppy infant,\u2019 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive.","pathophysiology":"Lack of GAA leads to massive lysosomal glycogen storage in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Cardiomyocytes hypertrophy, and skeletal muscle fibers develop vacuoles, disrupting contractile function and causing hypotonia and respiratory failure.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is in the first months of life with feeding difficulties, macroglossia, cardiomegaly, severe hypotonia, and respiratory distress. Without treatment, death typically occurs by age 1 due to cardiorespiratory failure.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis by dried blood spot or leukocyte GAA activity assay, genetic confirmation of GAA mutations, echocardiography for cardiomyopathy, and muscle biopsy showing PAS-positive vacuoles if needed.","management_principles":"Early enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa significantly improves survival and motor outcomes. Supportive care includes respiratory support, ACE inhibitors for cardiomyopathy, and nutritional support.","follow_up_guidelines":"Frequent cardiac (echocardiography every 3\u20136 months) and respiratory assessments, developmental evaluations, and monitoring of anti-GAA antibodies are recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. Macroglossia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a floppy infant are hallmark. 2. ERT before 6 months yields best outcomes. 3. Hepatomegaly is common. 4.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)","Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)","Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)","(Option missing)"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option C is correct because CIDP presents with symmetric proximal and distal weakness, sensory loss in toes and fingers, and can occasionally show fasciculations and foot drop in chronic disease due to prominent demyelination and secondary axonal loss. LEMS (A) typically produces proximal weakness without sensory symptoms and is associated with autonomic features. MMN (B) is a purely motor neuropathy with conduction block but no sensory signs. The missing options do not alter that CIDP is the only symmetric sensorimotor neuropathy among those choices.","conceptual_foundation":"CIDP is an immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy classified under ICD-11 8A41. Unlike the acute form (GBS), CIDP evolves over \u22658 weeks. Differential diagnoses include diabetic neuropathy, hereditary demyelinating neuropathies (e.g., CMT1), and paraneoplastic neuropathies. Pathologically, segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion-bulb formation occur due to macrophage-mediated myelin stripping. Antibodies to nodal proteins (e.g., neurofascin-155) are described in subsets.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral myelin promotes rapid conduction; in CIDP, autoreactive T cells and macrophages breach the blood-nerve barrier, initiating complement activation and myelin destruction. Chronic cycles of demyelination lead to secondary axonal degeneration, explaining fasciculations (denervation) in advanced disease. Remyelinated segments have shorter internodes and thinner myelin, slowing conduction and causing conduction block.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with slowly progressive or relapsing symmetric weakness in proximal and distal limbs, sensory ataxia, and absent reflexes. Onset is insidious over months. Variants include distal acquired demyelinating symmetric neuropathy (DADS), multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), and pure sensory CIDP. Pain occurs in ~30%. Foot drop may develop from peroneal involvement.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: NCS/EMG show prolonged distal latencies, slowed conduction velocities, conduction block, temporal dispersion, and absent F-waves. CSF shows elevated protein with normal cell count in ~80%. Second-tier: nerve MRI may show nerve root enlargement; antiganglioside antibodies have limited sensitivity. Third-tier: nerve biopsy reveals demyelination, onion bulbs, and perivascular inflammatory infiltrates.","management_principles":"First-line treatments include high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 1 mg/kg) and IVIG (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days). Plasmapheresis is also effective. Choice depends on comorbidities and preferences (Level A, EFNS/PNS 2010). Second-line immunosuppressants (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) are used for maintenance or refractory cases. Rituximab may be considered in nodal antibody\u2013positive patients.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor strength and function (e.g., MRC sum score, INCAT disability scale) monthly until stable, then every 3\u20136 months. Repeat NCS at 6-month intervals to assess demyelination. Taper immunotherapy based on clinical stability; monitor for relapse and adjust therapy accordingly.","clinical_pearls":"1. CIDP is the only symmetric sensorimotor demyelinating neuropathy that evolves over >8 weeks. 2. CSF protein >1 g/L supports diagnosis but is not specific. 3. Nerve conduction block in proximal segments may require F-wave and H-reflex studies. 4. Early treatment improves long-term outcome; delay leads to irreversible axonal loss. 5. Monitor for steroid side effects when using long-term prednisone.","references":"1. Van den Bergh PYK, Hadden RDM, Bouche P, et al.
