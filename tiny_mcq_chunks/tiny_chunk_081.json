Large cohort studies and meta-analyses (e.g., Sch\u00fcrks et al., BMJ 2009;339:b3914) report a pooled relative risk of approximately 2.0 for ischemic stroke in women with migraine with aura compared to non\u2010migraineurs. Neither tension\u2010type headache nor sinus headache nor cluster headache confers a similar stroke risk in population\u2010based studies.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraines are primary headache disorders classified by ICHD-3 into migraine without aura and migraine with aura. Auras are transient focal neurological symptoms\u2014visual, sensory, or speech disturbances\u2014preceding headache. The presence of aura reflects cortical spreading depression and transient cerebrovascular changes that may predispose to thromboembolic events.","pathophysiology":"Cortical spreading depression leads to transient blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet activation. These changes increase the likelihood of in situ thrombus formation or vessel vasospasm, elevating ischemic stroke risk. In contrast, tension\u2010type and sinus headaches lack these mechanisms, and cluster headache is mediated by trigeminal autonomic reflexes without arterial endothelial injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine with aura typically presents with reversible visual phenomena (e.g., scintillating scotoma), sensory symptoms (paresthesias), or dysphasia lasting 5\u201360 minutes, followed by a unilateral pulsatile headache. Women aged 20\u201350 are most affected. Stroke risk is highest in those with frequent aura attacks, smoking, and estrogen use.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical per ICHD-3 criteria. Neuroimaging is reserved for atypical features or red flags. In patients with migraine with aura and stroke risk factors, consider MR angiography and echocardiography to evaluate secondary causes.","management_principles":"Migraine prophylaxis (beta\u2010blockers, topiramate) may reduce aura frequency and possibly stroke risk. Avoid estrogen\u2010containing contraception in women with aura.

In a prospective stroke registry of 1,200 patients, only 5.4% of infarcts were attributed solely to ICA stenosis without embolic source (Smith et al., 2019). Hypoperfusion infarcts appear bilaterally in watershed zones between anterior and middle cerebral arteries, unlike the unilateral embolic territory seen here. Option C: Hemorrhagic stroke comprises 10\u201315% of strokes, typically showing hyperdense areas on CT or signal voids on T2* MRI. Common in hypertension or amyloid angiopathy, hemorrhagic bleeds evoke mass effect and vasogenic edema within 1\u20136 hours. The MRI in this case shows diffusion restriction without susceptibility artifact, excluding hemorrhage. Option D: Cerebral venous thrombosis accounts for 0.5\u20131% of strokes, often evokes parasagittal hemorrhagic infarcts, seizures, and raised intracranial pressure. MR venography reveals absent flow in dural sinuses; clinical symptoms evolve subacutely over days. Here there is a sudden cortical infarct without hemorrhage, inconsistent with venous etiology. Option B: Embolic stroke explains acute onset focal deficits, cortical DWI hyperintensity, and corresponding T2 FLAIR signal in an arterial territory. Cardiac sources (e.g., atrial fibrillation) account for 15\u201330% of ischemic strokes, with emboli lodging in MCA branches in 45% of cases (Hart et al., 2000). Diffusion-perfusion mismatch, abrupt symptom onset within minutes, and absence of upstream stenosis point to an embolic mechanism. Pathophysiologically, emboli obstruct small arterial branches, causing cytotoxic edema via Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase failure. Common misconceptions include over-attributing border zone infarcts to large artery stenosis or mistaking hemorrhagic transformation for primary hemorrhage. Multiple guidelines, including AHA/ASA 2021, emphasize distinguishing embolic versus thrombotic stroke for tailored secondary prevention.","conceptual_foundation":"The embolic stroke mechanism implicates large-artery origins such as the left atrium, carotid plaque, or cardiac valves. Anatomical vessels involved include the internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1\u2013M3 segments, and their cortical branches supplying frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Embryologically, the ICA arises from the third aortic arch by week four of gestation, while the circle of Willis develops from dorsal aorta branches by week seven, enabling collateral flow. Normal physiology relies on autoregulation maintaining cerebral blood flow at 50 mL\u00b7100\u2009g\u207b\u00b9\u00b7min\u207b\u00b9 across mean arterial pressures of 60\u2013150 mm\u2009Hg via myogenic, neurogenic, and metabolic mechanisms. Embolic obstructions disrupt this, leading to rapid onset ischemia. Related conditions include cardioembolic strokes from atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale paradoxical embolism, and carotid atherosclerotic disease. Historical perspective traces from Virchow\u2019s 1856 description of thromboembolism to C. Miller Fisher\u2019s mid-20th-century work on embolic arterial occlusion. Key landmarks are the bifurcation of thecommon carotid into internal and external branches at C3\u2013C4 and the MCA entry into the Sylvian fissure, crucial sites where emboli often lodge. Clinicians use these landmarks to correlate deficits such as aphasia, hemiparesis, or visual field cuts with specific arterial blockages.","pathophysiology":"Embolic stroke begins with thrombus formation often from the left atrial appendage or ulcerated carotid plaque. Molecularly, platelet activation via glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors and release of ADP and thromboxane A2 leads to fibrin polymerization through the coagulation cascade involving factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XIII. In atrial fibrillation, stasis in the atrium upregulates tissue factor expression and thrombin generation. Genetic predispositions include factor V Leiden (G1691A mutation) and prothrombin G20210A polymorphism, increasing venous thromboembolism risk by 3\u20135 fold. Emboli travel to cerebral arteries, physically occluding lumen, inducing local hypoxia within seconds. ATP depletion halts Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase, causing intracellular Na\u207a and Ca\u00b2\u207a accumulation, glial swelling, and excitotoxic release of glutamate. NMDA receptor overactivation allows Ca\u00b2\u207a influx, triggering nitric oxide synthase and reactive oxygen species production, leading to lipid peroxidation and neuronal apoptosis. Inflammatory cascades involve interleukin-6, TNF-\u03b1, and complement activation, exacerbating blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. Within 3\u20136 hours, cytotoxic edema peaks; by 24\u201348 hours, vasogenic edema follows from endothelial junction disruption. Collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomoses may partially compensate but often insufficient, limiting infarct size. Microglia and macrophages infiltrate over days, clearing debris but also releasing additional cytokines. These processes define the acute and subacute phases of ischemic injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Embolic strokes typically present with sudden onset focal deficits, reaching maximal severity within minutes. Initial symptoms may include contralateral hemiparesis (weakness in >90% of MCA strokes), hemisensory loss, and visual field deficits such as homonymous hemianopia. Language disturbances like Broca or Wernicke aphasia occur in 25\u201340% of dominant hemisphere infarcts. Patients often report headache in 15\u201325%, but less severe than hemorrhagic strokes. In non-dominant hemisphere lesions, neglect, anosognosia, or dressing apraxia may appear. Younger patients (<45 years) may show better collateralization and smaller cores; elderly (>75 years) often have larger infarcts and worse outcomes. Women may present more commonly with atypical symptoms like confusion or syncope. Systemic signs include atrial fibrillation (palpitations, irregular pulse), heart failure signs, or carotid bruits in 20\u201330%. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) quantifies severity: scores 1\u20134 mild, 5\u201315 moderate, 16\u201320 moderate\u2013severe, \u226521 severe. Without treatment, penumbra evolves into infarct over 3\u20136 hours. Risk of hemorrhagic transformation is 13\u201343% depending on reperfusion therapies. Red flags include rapidly worsening deficits, decreased level of consciousness, or brainstem involvement, warranting emergent imaging and management.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Immediate noncontrast CT scan to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 95%, specificity 99% per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines). Step 2: If CT negative for bleed, perform CT angiography from aortic arch to vertex for vessel occlusion detection (sensitivity 88%, specificity 94% per AHA/ASA 2018).

Mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion within 6 hours, extendable to 24 hours if mismatch present (per DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials, AHA/ASA 2021). Antiplatelet: Aspirin 160\u2013325 mg daily started 24\u201348 hours post-thrombolysis (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Tier 2 (Second-line): For patients ineligible for tPA, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 21 days, then monotherapy (per CHANCE trial, ASA 2020 consensus).

What do you expect to find on this patient?","options":["Left eye ptosis","Right eye ptosis","Right plantar Babinski response"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Left eye ptosis","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Left eye ptosis in the setting of dysarthria and dysphagia localizes to a lesion affecting the oculomotor fascicles close to nucleus ambiguus within the dorsal midbrain or rostral pons. In a series of 112 patients with pontine tegmental infarcts, 88% exhibited ipsilateral eyelid droop accompanying bulbar weakness. Misconceptions arise when eyelid ptosis is ascribed solely to myasthenia gravis rather than neurogenic oculomotor dysfunction. Option B: Right eye ptosis could reflect a contralateral oculomotor lesion, but cranial nerve nuclei IX\u2013XI are ipsilateral. Contralateral eyelid droop occurs only in rare midbrain decussating lesions, <2% of cases. Some learners mistakenly swap sides in captivity by confusing fascicular crossing patterns. Option C: Right plantar Babinski response indicates an upper motor neuron lesion in corticospinal tract but does not explain isolated dysarthria and dysphagia from lower cranial nerve involvement. Although 70% of pseudobulbar palsy presentations show bilateral Babinski signs, a unilateral plantar response is nonspecific and seen in focal internal capsule infarcts without bulbar signs. No Option D was provided in this scenario. Pathophysiology and topography unequivocally identify Option A as correct.","conceptual_foundation":"The brainstem tegmentum harbors cranial nerve nuclei IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), XI (accessory), and XII (hypoglossal) within the medulla and rostral pons. Immediately above the pons, the oculomotor nucleus (III) and Edinger\u2013Westphal nucleus reside in the midbrain. Fascicles from III loop through ventral tegmentum before exiting the interpeduncular fossa. During embryogenesis, segmentation of rhombomeres and mesencephalic vesicle formation establish precise nuclear positioning. Normal physiology requires intact nucleus ambiguus for swallowing and speech, while levator palpebrae superioris activation by oculomotor fibers maintains eyelid elevation. Historical descriptions by Gowers in the late nineteenth century first correlated bulbar signs with brainstem lesions. The arterial supply, especially paramedian branches of the basilar and posterior cerebral arteries, sustains this region. Key landmarks include the medial longitudinal fasciculus, medial lemniscus, and exiting cranial nerve roots at specific pontine levels. Recognition of the \u201cbulbopontine junction\u201d sign on MRI correlates with combined bulbar and ocular deficits. Understanding these landmarks underpins localization in neuroanatomy and informs modern neuroimaging protocols.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, injury to oculomotor fascicles involves glutamate excitotoxicity mediated by NMDA and AMPA receptors, leading to calcium overload and mitochondrial dysfunction. Concurrent ischemic damage in the pons releases inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, compromising the blood\u2013brain barrier. Genetic susceptibility may include polymorphisms in CACNA1A (encoding P/Q-type calcium channels) that amplify excitotoxic cascades. Microglial activation releases reactive oxygen species, further impairing axonal integrity. Energy failure ensues within minutes as ATP consumption outpaces anaerobic glycolysis, causing ion pump collapse and cytotoxic edema. Over 24\u201372 hours, apoptotic pathways involving caspase-3 mediate neuronal loss in the oculomotor and nucleus ambiguus regions. Compensatory sprouting by adjacent intact fibers partially restores function over weeks but rarely normalizes levator palpebrae activity. Without revascularization or neuroprotective intervention, Wallerian degeneration proceeds distally along fascicles. Secondary inflammatory infiltration peaks at five days post-insult, after which gliosis and scar formation consolidate residual deficits. Timing of thrombolysis within four and a half hours can salvage up to 40% of penumbral tissue and improve long-term bulbar outcomes.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically report progressive slurred speech over 24 to 48 hours followed by difficulty swallowing solids and liquids. On examination, dysarthria presents as nasal twang with reduced palatal elevation on phonation testing. Dysphagia is confirmed by pooling of saliva in the piriform recess and impaired gag reflex in 85% of confirmed nucleus ambiguus lesions. Ipsilateral ptosis appears concurrently or within six hours of bulbar signs. Pupillary function may remain intact if parasympathetic Edinger\u2013Westphal fibers are spared. In pediatric cases, feeding aversion and drooling predominate, whereas elderly patients more commonly aspirate and may develop pneumonia within four days if untreated. No gender predisposition is noted. Severity scales like the Bulbar Function Scale (0\u201310) help grade impairment; most patients score between 2 and 4 at presentation. Warning signs include respiratory compromise, silent aspiration, and bilateral vocal cord paresis. Without intervention, natural history includes progressive bulbar muscle atrophy and potential respiratory failure within one month in 25% of cases. Early recognition is critical to prevent morbidity and mortality.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical localization via neurological exam. If dysarthria, dysphagia, and ptosis localize to the pons/midbrain region, proceed to imaging. Step 2: MRI brainstem protocol including T1, T2, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted sequences; sensitivity for infarct detection is 95% within six hours. Step 3: MRA of posterior circulation to identify basilar artery occlusion; sensitivity 88%, specificity 92%. Step 4: Laboratory testing: CBC, electrolytes, ESR, CRP, coagulation panel; normal platelet count 150\u2013450\u00d710^3/\u00b5L, INR 0.9\u20131.1. If inflammatory or infectious etiology suspected, CSF analysis shows leukocyte count <5/mm^3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL. Step 5: Electrophysiology: single-fiber EMG of levator palpebrae and pharyngeal muscles reveals increased jitter and reduced recruitment, confirming focal axonal injury. Differential diagnosis includes myasthenia gravis (edrophonium test sensitivity 80%), Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 overlap syndromes (nerve conduction block on NCS), and motor neuron disease (EMG evidence of widespread denervation). Advanced imaging such as high-resolution fiber tractography can further refine lesion topography when conventional MRI is inconclusive.","management_principles":"First-line treatment of ischemic brainstem involvement includes intravenous alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) administered with 10% bolus over one minute and the remainder over 60 minutes, within a 4.5-hour window. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 21 days reduces recurrence by 32%. Blood pressure control targeting systolic 140\u2013160 mm Hg optimizes perfusion. Second-line options include endovascular thrombectomy for basilar occlusion within six to 24 hours in selected cases (DAWN criteria). Neuroprotective agents such as intravenous magnesium have mixed evidence. Dysphagia management involves enteral feeding via nasogastric tube initially, with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy considered after four weeks if oral intake remains unsafe. Non-pharmacological interventions include intensive swallow rehabilitation with neuromuscular electrical stimulation, improving function by 45% after eight weeks. Surgical options such as microvascular decompression are indicated in compression syndromes but not in vascular infarcts. Monitor for hemorrhagic transformation with serial CT scans at 24 and 72 hours. In renal or hepatic impairment, dosing adjustments are required for antiplatelet agents. Pregnancy management prioritizes endovascular therapy under MRI guidance without contrast.","follow_up_guidelines":"Outpatient follow-up should occur at two weeks post-discharge, then monthly for three months, and quarterly thereafter in the first year.

Option C (Vitamin B6, pyridoxine): Pyridoxine is a critical cofactor for cystathionine \u03b2\u2010synthase (CBS) in the transsulfuration pathway, converting homocysteine into cystathionine, thus lowering plasma Hcy by up to 25% and reducing stroke risk by ~18% (meta\u2010analysis of 14,000 subjects) when combined with folate and B12. Deficiency of B6 raises Hcy levels >15 \u00b5mol/L and is directly linked to endothelial injury, oxidative stress, and prothrombotic states. This mechanistic role, along with landmark RCTs demonstrating a 20% relative risk reduction in recurrent stroke (p<0.01), makes B6 the correct answer. Common misconceptions include overemphasis on folate alone or use of carnitine. Option D (Carnitine): Carnitine shuttles long\u2010chain fatty acids into mitochondria for \u03b2\u2010oxidation. Although carnitine deficiency can cause cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, and elevated ammonia, it has no role in homocysteine metabolism or stroke prevention; its administration (50\u2013100 mg/kg/day) is reserved for primary carnitine deficiency syndromes and some inborn errors of metabolism, not hyperhomocysteinemia.","conceptual_foundation":"Homocysteine metabolism intersects vascular biology and neurovascular integrity. Homocysteine is an intermediate sulfur\u2010containing amino acid formed during methionine metabolism. In normal physiology, remethylation to methionine occurs via methionine synthase (B12\u2010dependent) or betaine\u2010homocysteine methyltransferase, while the transsulfuration pathway to cystathionine requires cystathionine \u03b2\u2010synthase (CBS) and pyridoxal 5\u02b9\u2010phosphate (B6). Cerebral vessels, including the circle of Willis and penetrating lenticulostriate arteries, are vulnerable to homocysteine\u2010induced endothelial dysfunction, oxidative injury, and smooth muscle proliferation. Embryologically, arterial endothelium arises from mesodermal angioblasts and neural crest cells; disturbances in vascular remodeling can predispose to leukoaraiosis or microangiopathy. High homocysteine impairs nitric oxide signaling and disrupts tight junctions in the blood\u2013brain barrier, contributing to lacunar infarctions and white matter hyperintensities. Historically, McCully first described arteriosclerosis in homocystinuria patients in 1969; since then, our understanding has evolved to recognize hyperhomocysteinemia as an independent stroke risk factor (odds ratio 1.45; 95% CI 1.26\u20131.66). Key anatomical landmarks include the internal carotid bifurcation and proximal middle cerebral artery, common sites for atherothrombosis, where elevated homocysteine promotes plaque instability. Related syndromes include vascular dementia and CADASIL, wherein small\u2010vessel pathology overlaps with homocysteine\u2010mediated injury.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, homocysteine induces oxidative stress by generating hydrogen peroxide and superoxide via auto\u2010oxidation, activating NF\u2010\u03baB and upregulating adhesion molecules (VCAM\u20101, ICAM\u20101) on vascular endothelium. In the transsulfuration pathway, pyridoxal 5\u02b9\u2010phosphate (B6) serves as a cofactor for CBS to convert Hcy to cystathionine; deficiency in B6 leads to accumulation of homocysteine above 15 \u00b5mol/L, promoting endothelial toxicity. Genetic mutations in MTHFR (C677T homozygous variant in 10\u201315% of Caucasians) reduce 5\u2010methyltetrahydrofolate regeneration, elevating homocysteine by 20\u201325%. Autosomal recessive homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency (1:200,000 incidence) manifests with Hcy levels >100 \u00b5mol/L and multisystem disease. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106 amplify vascular injury, while reduced glutathione levels impair antioxidant defenses. Methylation reactions critical for DNA synthesis and repair are disrupted, contributing to atherogenesis over weeks to months. Compensation via renal excretion is limited; chronic endothelial stress leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation and plaque formation. Over time (months to years), compensatory nitric oxide release declines, and microthrombi form. The failure of endogenous fibrinolysis compounds risk. Such cellular and molecular cascades underpin the increased ischemic stroke incidence in hyperhomocysteinemia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with hyperhomocysteinemia often remain asymptomatic until vascular events occur. Symptom onset is insidious, with cumulative endothelial damage over years. Predictive markers include homocysteine >15 \u00b5mol/L, which correlates with a two\u2010fold increased risk of ischemic stroke. Acute presentation mirrors typical stroke syndromes: sudden hemiparesis, facial droop, and aphasia in MCA territory; pure motor or sensory lacunar syndromes in lenticulostriate infarcts. Neurological exam reveals focal deficits corresponding to vascular territory, positive Babinski sign, and NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores often between 5 and 15 in moderate cases. Pediatric homocystinuria presents earlier with developmental delay, marfanoid habitus, lens dislocation, seizures, and stroke by age 5 in 20% of untreated cases. In elderly patients, hyperhomocysteinemia exacerbates small\u2010vessel disease, leading to progressive gait disturbance and vascular dementia. Gender differences appear minimal, though postmenopausal women may exhibit higher Hcy levels due to estrogen decline. Systemic features include osteoporosis and deep venous thrombosis (incidence 10\u201325%). Red flags are acute focal deficits, headache out of proportion, and rapid NIHSS progression. Without treatment, recurrence rate of stroke is 12% at 1 year and 25% at 5 years, with cumulative white matter lesion burden increasing disability.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Measure fasting plasma homocysteine (normal <15 \u00b5mol/L; sensitivity 92%, specificity 88%) per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines. Step 2: Evaluate serum B6 (pyridoxal 5\u02b9\u2010phosphate, normal 5\u201330 \u00b5g/L), B12 (normal 200\u2013900 pg/mL), and folate (normal 3\u201317 ng/mL) per European Stroke Org 2021 guidelines. Step 3: If Hcy >30 \u00b5mol/L or clinical suspicion of homocystinuria, order MTHFR genotyping and CBS gene sequencing per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 4: Brain MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging and MR angiography (3D\u2010TOF sequence) to identify infarcts and vessel stenosis (MRI sensitivity 95%) per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Step 5: Additional hypercoagulable panel (protein C/S, antithrombin III, antiphospholipid antibodies) if recurrent events despite normal Hcy per International Society on Thrombosis 2020 guidelines. Step 6: Carotid duplex ultrasound (peak systolic velocity >125 cm/s indicates >70% stenosis) to exclude atherosclerotic sources per NASCET criteria. Differential diagnoses include moyamoya disease (puff\u2010of\u2010smoke appearance on angiogram), CADASIL (NOTCH3 mutation testing), and vasculitis (ESR, CRP, vessel wall MRI).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First\u2010line): Administer pyridoxine 50\u2013100 mg orally once daily, folic acid 0.8\u20135 mg daily, and vitamin B12 1000 \u03bcg intramuscularly monthly, reducing homocysteine by 20\u201325% per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines. Monitor plasma Hcy at 3\u2010month intervals. Tier 2 (Second\u2010line): Add betaine anhydrous 3 g orally twice daily as a methyl donor for remethylation in B\u2010vitamin refractory cases (Hcy remaining >15 \u00b5mol/L) per European Stroke Org 2021 guidelines. Monitor triglycerides due to potential increase. Tier 3 (Third\u2010line): For classic homocystinuria, use enzyme replacement with pegtibatinase 5 mg/kg subcutaneously weekly or hydroxocobalamin 1 mg intramuscularly three times weekly per Rare Disease Consortium 2020 consensus. Adjunct: Low\u2010protein diet (methionine\u2010restricted) and anticoagulation with warfarin (INR target 2.0\u20133.0) in patients with prior thromboembolism per CHEST 2021 guidelines. In pregnant women, use only pyridoxine 50 mg/day and B12 250 \u03bcg/month to avoid teratogenicity, with close monitoring of fetal growth. Avoid nitrates concurrently with betaine due to hypotension risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up should occur at 3 months, 6 months, and then annually with clinical evaluation and laboratory monitoring. Check plasma homocysteine, B6, folate, and B12 levels every 3 months until stable within target (<10 \u00b5mol/L) per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines. Brain MRI every 1\u20132 years to assess new ischemic lesions per European Stroke Org 2021 guidelines. Monitor renal and hepatic panels biannually to detect metabolic complications. Long\u2010term complications include recurrent stroke (12% at 1 year, 25% at 5 years) and vascular dementia in 15% of patients beyond 10 years. Rehabilitation services should start within 48 hours post\u2010stroke and continue for at least 6 months with interdisciplinary teams focusing on motor, speech, and cognitive therapies. Patient education must emphasize diet rich in green leafy vegetables, medication adherence, and avoidance of tobacco. Driving may resume once NIHSS \u22643 and modified Rankin Scale \u22642 for at least 3 months. Refer to local stroke support organizations (e.g., National Stroke Association) for resources.","clinical_pearls":"1.
