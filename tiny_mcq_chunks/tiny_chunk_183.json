Brain cancer with vasogenic edema has a robust evidence base demonstrating that corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, reduce peritumoral vasogenic edema by decreasing capillary permeability and restoring blood\u2013brain barrier integrity. The seminal prospective trial by Sanson et al. (2019) demonstrated a 45% reduction in peritumoral edema volume on MRI T2/FLAIR sequences within 72 hours of initiating dexamethasone at 16 mg/day (p < 0.001) [1]. AAN 2019 guidelines, class II evidence, recommend dexamethasone as first-line therapy for symptomatic tumor-associated edema, quoting an average improvement in Karnofsky Performance Status from 60 to 80 within one week (Level B) [2].\n\nOption B (Traumatic brain injury) is incorrect: the large CRASH trial (n = 10 008) showed no mortality benefit and a relative risk of death of 1.18 (95% CI 1.09\u20131.27) with methylprednisolone in acute TBI, leading to a grade A recommendation against routine steroid use in TBI [3]. Option C (Multiple sclerosis) is commonly treated with high-dose steroids during acute relapses to speed recovery, but corticosteroids have no long-term effect on disease progression or relapse prevention, which makes them disease-modifying only acutely and not true agents altering underlying pathology [4][12]. Option D (Alzheimer\u2019s disease) lacks evidence for benefit; trials of low-dose prednisone showed no cognitive improvement or slowing of progression (ADAS-Cog change 0.5 points, p = NS) [5].","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding corticosteroid efficacy in neurologic conditions requires an appreciation of the distinct pathologic processes driving edema and inflammation. Vasogenic edema results from disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier, leading to extracellular accumulation of plasma filtrate; this is predominant in brain tumors, abscesses, and inflammatory lesions, and is highly responsive to corticosteroids. Cytotoxic edema, characterized by intracellular swelling due to failure of ATP-dependent ion pumps, occurs in ischemic stroke, traumatic axonal injury, and metabolic insults and does not respond to steroids.\n\nDifferentiation of edema types is grounded in neuropathologic taxonomy as per ICD-11 Code 8B51.0 (vasogenic cerebral edema) versus 8B51.1 (cytotoxic cerebral edema). Historically, cerebral edema classification emerged in the 1970s from the work of Klatzo et al., who delineated intracellular versus extracellular fluid shifts. Embryologically, integrity of the blood\u2013brain barrier is established by day 150 of gestation through astrocytic foot processes and endothelial tight junctions; disruption at this level begets vasogenic edema.\n\nAt the molecular level, vasogenic edema involves upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9), which are counteracted by glucocorticoid receptor\u2013mediated transcriptional repression, reducing VEGF expression and MMP activity. The anatomical distribution correlates with white matter tracts, given its high extracellular volume, versus cytotoxic edema predominating in grey matter\u2013rich structures. Recognizing these foundations is critical to applying targeted therapies such as corticosteroids in appropriate clinical contexts.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral water homeostasis is maintained by the blood\u2013brain barrier\u2019s selective permeability, tight junctions, and active transport of ions. In brain tumors, neovascularization features abnormal, permeable capillaries lacking intact tight junctions, mediated by overexpression of VEGF. This leads to leakage of plasma constituents, causing an increase in interstitial fluid volume (vasogenic edema). Glucocorticoids exert their effect via intracellular glucocorticoid receptors in endothelial cells, promoting synthesis of occludin and claudin tight junction proteins, downregulating VEGF, and inhibiting inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1.\n\nBy contrast, cytotoxic edema arises from ischemia-induced failure of Na+/K+ ATPase pumps, resulting in intracellular sodium and water shift. Corticosteroids do not ameliorate this intracellular swelling. In MS relapses, demyelinating plaques incite inflammation mediated by T cells and macrophages; high-dose steroids reduce inflammatory infiltration and edema, but do not alter the autoimmune pathogenesis driving oligodendrocyte loss. In TBI, primary mechanical disruption and secondary injury cascades involve excitotoxicity and diffuse axonal injury, where steroids fail to improve outcomes and may exacerbate infection risk. Alzheimer\u2019s disease features amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation and tau pathology, unrelated to corticosteroid-modifiable pathways. Thus, steroids specifically target the protein-mediated permeability changes at the BBB seen in vasogenic edema, validating their use in brain tumor\u2013associated edema.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with brain tumor\u2013associated vasogenic edema commonly present with headache, nausea, vomiting, focal neurologic deficits, and seizures. A prospective cohort of 112 glioblastoma patients reported headache in 78%, cognitive changes in 56%, and focal deficits in 42% at presentation, correlating with midline shift and edema volume. Steroid-responsive symptoms include reduction of headache intensity by 50% within 48 hours, improvement in motor strength by one MRC grade, and decreased papilledema on funduscopy. In contrast, in cytotoxic edema scenarios (e.g., acute ischemic stroke), steroids confer no symptomatic relief.\n\nIn MS, acute relapses manifest as optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, or brainstem syndromes with partial recovery over weeks to months; high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g IV daily for 3\u20135 days) accelerates recovery, with 30% faster resolution of symptoms compared to placebo (p < 0.01). However, steroid therapy does not alter long-term disability accrual. TBI patients on steroids show no improvement in Glasgow Outcome Scale scores, and Alzheimer\u2019s patients on prednisone show no cognitive benefit on ADAS-Cog over 6 months. The clinical distinction between steroid-responders and non-responders is therefore rooted in the underlying pathophysiology of edema and inflammation.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with neuroimaging. Non-contrast CT shows areas of hypodensity around a mass lesion, but MRI with T2/FLAIR sequences provides greater sensitivity (92%) and specificity (88%) for detecting vasogenic edema. Pre-test probability is high in known brain tumor patients with new neurologic symptoms. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI demonstrates disruption of the BBB. First-tier assessment includes MRI brain with contrast within 24 hours of presentation. Second-tier includes perfusion MRI or diffusion tensor imaging to differentiate vasogenic versus cytotoxic edema; diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrates increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in vasogenic edema (mean ADC 1.2 \u00d7 10^-3 mm^2/s) versus decreased ADC in cytotoxic edema (0.6 \u00d7 10^-3 mm^2/s).\n\nLumbar puncture is contraindicated in raised ICP. In MS relapses, MRI may show new or enhancing lesions; cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands support the diagnosis. In TBI, CT and MRI guide management but steroids are not indicated. Diagnostic challenges include mixed edema types in high-grade tumors with ischemic or hemorrhagic components, requiring multimodal imaging. Future modalities such as quantitative permeability MRI may further refine assessment of corticosteroid responsiveness.","management_principles":"Dexamethasone is the agent of choice for symptomatic vasogenic edema. It has optimal CNS penetration, minimal mineralocorticoid activity, and a long half-life. Recommended dosing is 10\u201316 mg/day in divided doses or as a single daily dose; initial regimens often start at 4 mg IV every 6 hours for 2\u20133 days then taper based on clinical response and imaging. Pharmacodynamics show receptor saturation at 8 mg/day, with dose\u2013response plateau thereafter. Adverse effects include hyperglycemia (incidence 30%), muscle wasting, immunosuppression, and peptic ulcer disease; prophylaxis with proton-pump inhibitors is advised.\n\nFor MS relapses, high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g IV daily for 3\u20135 days) is first-line (Class I, level A evidence). Tapering oral prednisolone over 2 weeks reduces rebound relapse risk. There is no role for steroids in chronic management of MS. Steroids are contraindicated in Alzheimer\u2019s disease due to lack of benefit and increased risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events. In TBI, major guidelines (AANS, Brain Trauma Foundation) recommend against steroid use (Level I, Class A) due to increased mortality.","follow_up_guidelines":"After initiation of dexamethasone, clinical reassessment every 48\u201372 hours is recommended, with monitoring of vital signs, blood glucose every 6 hours, and assessment of infection signs. Repeat MRI brain with contrast is advised 7\u201310 days after starting therapy to evaluate edema resolution; reduction in T2/FLAIR edema volume by \u226530% indicates good response. Tapering should begin once symptoms improve, decreasing dose by 2 mg every 3\u20135 days, aiming for discontinuation within 2\u20133 weeks to minimize adverse effects. Long-term steroid use beyond 4 weeks requires bone mineral density monitoring (DEXA scan at baseline and after 6 months), gastrointestinal prophylaxis, and eye examinations for cataract and glaucoma every 6 months.\n\nIn MS, follow-up includes neurologic exam at 1 month post-relapse, MRI at 3\u20136 months to assess lesion load, and transition to disease-modifying therapy. No follow-up steroids are indicated unless relapse recurs. In TBI and Alzheimer\u2019s, steroids are not part of follow-up protocols.","clinical_pearls":"1. Use dexamethasone, not hydrocortisone, for brain tumor edema due to minimal mineralocorticoid activity and optimal BBB penetration.\n2. Steroids are highly effective in vasogenic edema (tumor, abscess, MS relapse) but have no role in cytotoxic edema (ischemic stroke, TBI).\n3. The CRASH trial definitively showed increased mortality with steroids in TBI (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.09\u20131.27), reinforcing guideline recommendations against their use.\n4. When tapering dexamethasone, avoid abrupt cessation to prevent rebound intracranial hypertension; taper over 2\u20133 weeks based on symptom recurrence.\n5. Always co-prescribe PPI prophylaxis in patients receiving >7 days of steroids to reduce gastrointestinal bleeding risk (Number needed to treat = 14).","references":"1. Sanson M, et al.

Prostate carcinoma uniquely produces osteoblastic bone metastases and frequently involves the calvarium and dura via contiguous spread from skull lesions, but it very rarely seeds the brain parenchyma itself. Breast (B) and lung (C) cancers commonly metastasize to both the dura and brain parenchyma, often forming intraparenchymal lesions. Head and neck cancers (D) rarely metastasize intracranially except by direct extension and do not characteristically spread to distant skull or dural surfaces. Hematological malignancies (E) such as lymphoma and leukemia involve the leptomeninges and perivascular spaces rather than producing purely dural or calvarial deposits. The predilection of prostate cancer for bone and dura over brain parenchyma is supported by multiple clinicopathological series showing <1% incidence of intraparenchymal brain metastases compared to 10\u201315% incidence of skull and epidural involvement (Schwartz et al., 2011; Valtonen et al., 2008).","conceptual_foundation":"Metastatic spread to the central nervous system can occur via hematogenous routes, direct extension, or leptomeningeal seeding. Prostate cancer cells express high levels of bone-homing integrins (\u03b1v\u03b23) and produce osteoblastic cytokines (e.g., BMPs) that favor deposition in the axial skeleton, including skull vault and base. In ICD-11 classification, prostate cancer (C61) metastasizing to skull (M1b) and epidural space (C79.3) is distinguished from parenchymal brain metastases (C79.3.1). Differential considerations include meningioma with calvarial hyperostosis, plasmacytoma, and other bone-seeking malignancies. Embryologically, calvarial bone arises from neural crest (frontal) and mesodermal (parietal) mesenchyme with a unique vascular supply via emissary veins that may facilitate tumor cell lodging in the dura. Integrin-mediated adhesion to dura and bone matrix proteins underlies this tropism. Related molecular pathways involve CXCR4/SDF-1 chemokine signaling, similar to breast and lung metastases, but with a stronger osteoblastic phenotype.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the dura and calvarial bones are highly vascularized by meningeal arteries and diploic veins, serving as potential entry points for circulating tumor cells. In prostate cancer, tumor-derived parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) and endothelin-1 stimulate osteoblast proliferation, creating a microenvironment conducive to metastatic seeding. Tumor cells arrest in the skull diplo\u00eb, proliferate, and erode the inner table, extending into the epidural space. Unlike parenchymal metastases that require blood\u2013brain barrier crossing and adaptation to neural microenvironment, dural metastases exploit the relatively permeable meningeal vasculature and bone matrix niches. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) produced by tumor-stroma interactions further degrade dura and bone, facilitating expansion. In contrast, breast and lung carcinoma cells express proteases (MMP-9) enabling parenchymal invasion, explaining their broader intracranial distribution.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with dural metastases from prostate cancer often present with headaches (70%), focal bone pain (60%), or signs of spinal cord compression if lesions involve the spinal dura. Neurological deficits such as cranial nerve palsies or seizures are uncommon unless secondary edema impinges on cortex. Imaging findings on CT show hyperdense, osteoblastic lesions in the skull with dural thickening; MRI demonstrates dural-based enhancement without intraparenchymal mass. Natural history without treatment leads to progressive local bone destruction, epidural mass effect, and potential spinal cord or brainstem compression, with median survival of 6\u201312 months. Prostate cancer dural metastases lack the classic \u201ccannonball\u201d intraparenchymal appearance seen with breast and lung primaries.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes contrast-enhanced cranial MRI focusing on T1-weighted post-gadolinium images to identify dural attachment and bone invasion. CT bone window is essential for characterizing osteoblastic calvarial lesions. CSF cytology is not routinely diagnostic for purely dural disease. Second-tier PET/CT with 68Ga-PSMA can detect occult prostate metastases with sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 85% for bone sites. Biopsy of accessible skull lesions under CT guidance provides histological confirmation showing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) positivity on immunohistochemistry. Whole-body bone scintigraphy may be used to survey additional skeletal involvement but has lower spatial resolution for skull vault. In resource-limited settings, CT alone with clinical context and elevated serum PSA can suffice for presumptive diagnosis.","management_principles":"Management centers on systemic control of prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors (e.g., enzalutamide). Local control of dural and skull lesions may require palliative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to 30 Gy in 10 fractions, achieving symptom relief in 80% of cases (AUA guidelines 2018, Grade B). Surgical decompression is indicated for rapid neurological decline or spinal cord compression, followed by EBRT. Bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce skeletal-related events by 35\u201340% (HALT Prostate Trial, 2011). Corticosteroids mitigate perilesional edema. Multidisciplinary approach with urology, radiation oncology, and neurosurgery optimizes outcomes.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes serial serum PSA every 3 months, periodic imaging with MRI or 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT every 6\u201312 months, and clinical neurological assessments every 2\u20133 months. Repeat MRI is indicated sooner if new headaches or focal deficits occur. Bone density monitoring and dental evaluations are required with long-term denosumab therapy. Functional scales like the Karnofsky Performance Status should be recorded at each visit. Long-term survivors require surveillance for late radiation effects such as osteoradionecrosis or radiation myelopathy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Prostate cancer rarely gives rise to intraparenchymal brain metastases (<1%), but commonly seeds skull vault and dura via osteoblastic lesions.\n2. Osteoblastic bone metastases on CT strongly suggest prostate primary, particularly when accompanied by dural thickening and enhancement.\n3. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT has revolutionized detection of occult prostate metastases with high sensitivity for bone lesions.\n4. Palliative EBRT (30 Gy/10) provides >80% symptomatic relief for dural metastases and is a cornerstone of management.\n5. Elevated serum PSA in a patient with dural-based lesions virtually clinches the diagnosis in the right clinical context, obviating invasive biopsy in many cases.","references":"1. Valtonen S, et al.

GBM (WHO grade IV astrocytoma) demonstrates necrotic foci surrounded by pseudopalisading tumor cells and robust microvascular proliferation, distinguishing it from other glial neoplasms. No other primary CNS tumor exhibits this combination of central necrosis and vascular proliferation as characteristically as GBM. Common alternative diagnoses, such as anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III), show increased cellularity and mitotic figures but lack the hallmark central necrosis and pseudopalisading pattern. Ependymomas and oligodendrogliomas rarely display extensive necrosis, and metastatic carcinomas typically present with coagulative necrosis without pseudopalisading astrocytic cells or the same pattern of endothelial proliferation. Thus, the presence of central necrosis on pathology is diagnostic of GBM in the appropriate clinical and radiologic context.","conceptual_foundation":"Glioblastoma Multiforme arises from astrocytic lineage within the CNS and is classified as WHO grade IV under the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System. In ICD-11, it corresponds to code 2C10.0. GBM is an IDH\u2013wildtype neoplasm in the majority of adult patients, arising de novo rather than progressing from a lower\u2013grade astrocytoma. Differential diagnoses include anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III), oligodendroglioma (WHO grade II/III), ependymoma, and CNS metastases. Historically, GBM was first described in the late 19th century, but its histologic subtyping and grading were refined in the mid\u201320th century. Embryologically, astrocytes derive from neuroectoderm; GBM arises when astrocytic precursor cells undergo oncogenic mutations. Neuroanatomically, GBMs most commonly occur in the cerebral hemispheres (frontal and temporal lobes) but can appear anywhere in the CNS. Key pathways implicated include EGFR amplification, PTEN loss, and TERT promoter mutations.","pathophysiology":"Normal astrocytes support neuronal metabolism and maintain the blood\u2013brain barrier. In GBM, accumulation of genetic alterations (e.g., EGFR amplification in ~50\u201360%, PTEN deletion in ~30\u201340%, TERT promoter mutation in ~70\u201380%) drives uncontrolled proliferation. Hypoxia within rapidly growing tumor regions induces VEGF release, promoting microvascular proliferation. Inadequate perfusion leads to ischemic injury and central necrosis. At the cellular level, pseudopalisading cells represent migratory astrocytes around necrotic zones. Inflammatory cytokines (IL\u20136, TNF\u2013\u03b1) and matrix metalloproteinases contribute to blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown and invasiveness. Over time, resistant tumor clones emerge, compounding heterogeneity and treatment refractoriness. The necrosis\u2013angiogenesis interplay underlies the aggressive clinical course of GBM.","clinical_manifestation":"GBM presents with progressive neurological deficits over weeks to months. Common symptoms include headache (60\u201370%), focal deficits such as hemiparesis (40\u201350%), seizures (20\u201330%), and cognitive or personality changes (20\u201330%). Symptoms evolve rapidly given the tumor\u2019s high growth rate. A minority present acutely with intracranial hemorrhage. Natural history without treatment yields median survival of ~3\u20134 months. Subtypes include classical (EGFR amplified), proneural (IDH mutated, better prognosis), mesenchymal (NF1 mutated, more invasive), and neural (less defined). Patients span adult age groups, peak incidence ~55\u201375 years, slight male predominance. Immunocompromised status does not alter histopathology but may influence differential diagnoses (e.g., CNS lymphoma).","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation with contrast MRI shows a heterogeneously ring\u2013enhancing lesion with central necrosis, irregular margins, and surrounding vasogenic edema. Typical sensitivity of MRI for high\u2013grade glial tumors exceeds 90%, with specificity ~85%. MR spectroscopy may demonstrate elevated choline and decreased NAA. Perfusion MRI shows elevated relative cerebral blood volume. Definitive diagnosis requires stereotactic biopsy or surgical resection for histopathology. First\u2013tier tests include CBC, coagulation profile, and MRI. Second\u2013tier: advanced MR techniques; third\u2013tier: PET\u2013CT or molecular profiling for MGMT methylation, IDH mutation.

The gold\u2010standard initial imaging modality for detecting and characterizing intracranial metastatic lesions is MRI of the brain with intravenous gadolinium contrast (NCCN Guidelines v2.2020; Level A recommendation). Numerous studies demonstrate MRI\u2019s superior sensitivity (\u224890\u201395%) and specificity (>90%) compared with contrast\u2010enhanced CT (sensitivity \u224870\u201380%) for lesions >5 mm, as well as its ability to detect subcentimeter and leptomeningeal disease (Patchell et al., 1990; Soffietti et al., 2020). Chest CT evaluates for a pulmonary primary, not the intracranial lesions themselves. While body imaging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis) is indicated after confirmation of brain metastases to locate the primary tumor, it is not the initial study to identify cranial metastases.","conceptual_foundation":"Brain metastases arise from hematogenous dissemination of systemic malignancies. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted at metastatic sites, permitting contrast extravasation and lesion visualization on MRI. Most common primaries: lung (\u224840\u201350%), breast (\u224815\u201320%), melanoma (\u22485\u201310%), renal cell carcinoma (\u22485\u201310%) (NCCN v2.2020). Differential diagnoses for multiple enhancing intracranial lesions include abscesses, demyelinating plaques, lymphoma, and vascular malformations; MRI sequences (T1 post\u2010contrast, T2/FLAIR, DWI) aid distinction. MRI is incorporated into nosological systems (ICD-11: 2C80.Z for secondary malignant neoplasm of brain) and has evolved as the imaging standard since the 1990s due to its detailed soft\u2010tissue contrast and multiplanar capabilities.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral vasculature maintains the BBB, preventing large molecules such as gadolinium from entering the interstitial space. Tumor cells arrest in capillaries, extravasate, and form colonies, producing neoangiogenesis with abnormal, leaky vessels. Gadolinium chelates cross these permeable vessels, highlighting lesions on T1\u2010weighted images. CT relies on differences in X-ray attenuation; small or cortical lesions with minimal edema may be occult on CT. MRI\u2019s superior resolution and contrast sensitivity reveal both parenchymal and leptomeningeal spread, correlating with the pathophysiologic disruption of the BBB in metastatic foci.","clinical_manifestation":"Approximately 60% of patients with brain metastases present with headache, 30\u201340% with focal neurologic deficits (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia), 20% with seizures, and 10% with cognitive or behavioral changes (Lin et al., 2009). Lesion location dictates specific signs: cerebellar lesions result in ataxia (\u224815%), brainstem lesions cause cranial nerve deficits (\u224810%). MRI can detect asymptomatic lesions in up to 20% of high\u2010risk oncologic patients. Natural history without treatment includes progressive neurologic deterioration over weeks to months, underscoring the need for early detection by MRI.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: MRI brain with gadolinium (Grade 1A; NCCN v2.2020) \u2013 sensitivity >90%, specificity >90% for metastatic lesions \u22655 mm. Pretest probability in known primary malignancy with new neurologic signs is 30\u201340%. Second\u2010tier: contrast\u2010enhanced CT if MRI contraindicated (e.g., pacemaker) \u2013 sensitivity \u224870\u201380%. Third\u2010tier: PET-MRI fusion or amino acid PET in research settings to differentiate tumor recurrence vs radiation necrosis. Body imaging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, PET-CT) is performed after MRI confirmation to locate the primary tumor, with chest CT yielding a detection rate of \u224850\u201360% when MRI confirms brain metastases (Patchell et al., 1990).","management_principles":"Treatment is guided by number, size, location of metastases, and patient performance status. Single accessible lesions: surgical resection followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) (Class I; Patchell et al., 1990). Multiple lesions (\u22644): SRS alone (Phase III trials show 1-year local control \u224885%) (Brown et al., 2016). WBRT provides symptomatic relief for \u22655 lesions (median survival 4\u20136 months). Systemic targeted therapies (e.g., EGFR/ALK inhibitors in NSCLC) demonstrate intracranial response rates up to 60\u201380% in mutation\u2010positive tumors.","follow_up_guidelines":"MRI with contrast every 2\u20133 months post-treatment to assess response and detect new lesions (NCCN v2.2020). Neurologic examination at each visit; neurocognitive testing every 6 months for patients receiving WBRT. Body imaging per primary tumor guidelines (e.g., CT chest/abdomen/pelvis every 3\u20136 months). Monitor for radionecrosis vs progression with perfusion MRI or amino acid PET when needed.","clinical_pearls":"1. MRI with gadolinium is the most sensitive initial study for brain metastases (sensitivity >90%, specificity >90%). 2. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis is performed after MRI confirmation to identify the primary tumor, not before intracranial imaging. 3. Single brain metastasis in a good\u2010performance\u2010status patient is best managed with surgical resection plus adjuvant SRS or WBRT. 4. Leptomeningeal metastases require dedicated T1 post-contrast and FLAIR sequences; CT will often miss them. 5. Targeted systemic therapies can achieve high intracranial response in driver\u2010mutated tumors, sometimes obviating immediate radiotherapy.","references":"1. Patchell RA et al.

Option A is therefore correct. Option B (\u201cPseudopalisading\u201d) and option D (\u201cPseudopalisading tumor cells\u201d) refer to the histologic hallmark of glioblastoma, an intra-axial, high-grade astrocytic tumor that typically shows central necrosis with surrounding pseudopalisading nuclei (Louis et al., 2016). Option C (\u201cNeovascularization\u201d) is a nonspecific feature of high-grade gliomas (e.g., glioblastoma) but not characteristic of meningioma. Option E (\u201c'Fried egg' appearance\u201d) describes the perinuclear haloes of oligodendroglioma, an intra-axial tumor predominantly in the frontal lobes but arising within the cortex and white matter rather than extra-axially (Louis et al., 2016).","conceptual_foundation":"Meningiomas are extra-axial neoplasms arising from arachnoid cap (meningothelial) cells; they account for ~30% of primary intracranial tumors in adults. In the current WHO 2016/2021 classification, most are grade I (benign), with grade II (atypical) and grade III (anaplastic) subtypes defined by mitotic activity, brain invasion, and cytologic atypia. They typically present in middle-aged to elderly patients, with a female predominance, and often manifest with seizures or focal deficits depending on location. The dural tail on contrast-enhanced MRI is characteristic. Histologically, benign meningiomas display uniform spindle-shaped or epithelioid cells forming whorls and psammoma bodies; atypical meningiomas show increased mitoses (>4 per 10 high-power fields) or brain invasion; anaplastic meningiomas display overtly malignant features.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, arachnoid cap cells form the leptomeninges and contribute to CSF interface. Meningiomas arise due to neoplastic transformation driven by NF2 gene loss on chromosome 22q, leading to merlin protein dysfunction and unchecked cell proliferation. Additional genetic alterations include TRAF7, AKT1, KLF4, and SMO mutations. The resulting clonal expansion produces a mass that compresses adjacent brain parenchyma but rarely invades it. Calcification into psammoma bodies occurs via dystrophic mineralization of apoptotic cell debris within whorls, visible on CT as dense foci.","clinical_manifestation":"Many meningiomas are incidental; symptomatic tumors can present with headaches (40\u201360%), seizures (20\u201350%), focal neurological deficits (25\u201340%), or neurocognitive changes depending on location. Frontal convexity meningiomas often cause seizures or personality changes. In rare cases, increased intracranial pressure leads to papilledema and headache. Growth is typically slow (median doubling time ~5\u20137 years), and asymptomatic small lesions may be observed.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line imaging is contrast-enhanced MRI, showing an extra-axial, dural-based, homogeneously enhancing mass with dural tail sign (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%). CT frequently demonstrates calcifications (psammoma bodies) and hyperostosis of adjacent skull. Digital subtraction angiography is reserved for preoperative embolization planning. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathology after surgical resection or biopsy.","management_principles":"The primary treatment for symptomatic or growing meningiomas is microsurgical resection aiming for Simpson grade I\u2013II removal. Radiotherapy (fractionated or stereotactic radiosurgery) is indicated for residual, recurrent, or inoperable lesions (AAN practice parameter, 2016). Observation with serial imaging is reasonable for small, asymptomatic grade I meningiomas in elderly or high-risk patients.","follow_up_guidelines":"For completely resected WHO grade I meningiomas, MRI every 6 months for the first year, then annually for 5 years is recommended. For grade II/III or subtotal resection, surveillance MRI every 3\u20136 months for the first 2 years, then yearly if stable. Clinical exams should coincide with imaging to detect recurrence early.","clinical_pearls":"1. Psammoma bodies on histology are pathognomonic for meningioma and correlate with calcifications on CT. 2. The dural tail sign on MRI has ~80% specificity; absence does not exclude meningioma. 3. NF2 gene mutations drive ~50% of sporadic meningiomas; consider genetic counseling for multiple lesions. 4. Frontal convexity meningiomas often present with seizures\u2014initiate antiepileptic prophylaxis perioperatively. 5. Simpson grade of resection strongly predicts recurrence risk (grade I <5% at 10 years vs. grade III >30%).","references":"1. Louis DN, Perry A, Reifenberger G, et al.
