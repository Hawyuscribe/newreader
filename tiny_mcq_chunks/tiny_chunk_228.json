[{"question_number":"1","question":"A 60-year-old male patient had visual loss and denied it. Upon examination, he had a visual field defect. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Acalculia","Agraphia","Optic ataxia","Visual anosognosia"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Visual anosognosia","subspecialty":"Neuropsychiatry","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D. Visual anosognosia. Visual anosognosia, also known as Anton's syndrome, is characterized by true cortical blindness due to bilateral occipital lobe lesions with an accompanying denial of visual loss. Multiple case series and neuroimaging studies have confirmed that patients with bilateral occipital infarctions can present with confabulation and insistence that they can see despite objective evidence to the contrary (Bisiach et al., 2000; Morland et al., 2003). Level A evidence from neuropsychiatric surveys underscores that anosognosia for visual defects occurs in up to 30% of patients with cortical blindness (Moro et al., 2011).\n\nOption A (Acalculia) is incorrect because acalculia refers to a specific impairment in arithmetic abilities while visual recognition and awareness are preserved; it does not involve denial of visual loss (McCloskey et al., 1985). Option B (Agraphia) denotes a loss of writing ability due to angular gyrus or inferior parietal damage and does not involve visual denial (Mack et al., 1992). Option C (Optic ataxia) is a visuomotor coordination deficit in which patients cannot reach for objects under visual guidance, typically from parietal lobe lesions, but patients remain aware of their visual field status (Perenin & Vighetto, 1988). None of these conditions explain a visual field defect accompanied by denial of vision loss, solidifying Visual anosognosia as the correct diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Anosognosia derives from the Greek \"a-\" meaning absence, \"nosos\" meaning disease, and \"gnosis\" meaning knowledge. In modern nosology (ICD-11 code 8B49), anosognosia is classified under behavioural and emotional disturbances associated with organic disorders. Visual anosognosia specifically refers to unawareness of visual deficits. Historically, Anton in 1899 first described patients with cortical blindness who vehemently denied their deficit. Subsequent taxonomic efforts have placed Anton's syndrome within neuropsychiatric conditions that straddle the interface between neurology and psychiatry.\n\nEmbryologically, the primary visual cortex (V1) arises from the occipital lobe, itself developing from the caudal telencephalon. Lesions here disrupt afferent visual pathways from the lateral geniculate nucleus via the optic radiations. Neuroanatomically, bilateral V1 damage disconnects visual input but spares frontal monitoring networks, leading to a failure of error detection: the frontal lobes (particularly the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) cannot integrate feedback about visual failure. Neurotransmitter systems implicated include glutamatergic transmission in the occipital cortex and dopaminergic error-monitoring circuits in the prefrontal cortex. Genetic predispositions are not established for Antoni\u2019s syndrome, which is chiefly structural and vascular in origin.","pathophysiology":"Normal visual processing begins with retinal photoreceptors, transmitted via the optic nerves, chiasm, tracts, and lateral geniculate bodies to the primary visual cortex. In cortical blindness, bilateral infarction of V1 disrupts conscious visual perception. In visual anosognosia, there is additionally a failure of interhemispheric and fronto-occipital networks that normally monitor sensory deficits. Functional MRI studies demonstrate a decoupling of occipital cortex activation from anterior cingulate error-detection networks (Turner et al., 2008). At the cellular level, ischemic necrosis of V1 neurons, glial scarring, and loss of thalamocortical synapses abolish visual input. Meanwhile, intact frontal lobe mechanisms produce confabulated explanations for perceived visual experience. This dissociation explains why patients genuinely believe they can see despite total blindness and why they generate elaborate descriptions of scenes they cannot perceive.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with visual anosognosia present with complete or near-complete visual field loss but adamantly deny any impairment. They often confabulate detailed descriptions of their surroundings when confronted with their inability to navigate or identify objects. Cardinal signs include bilateral homonymous hemianopia or total visual field defect on confrontation testing, preserved pupillary light reflexes, and normal ocular movements. A prodrome may include transient ischemic attacks in posterior circulation. Frequency of anosognosia in cortical blindness ranges from 10% to 30% (Moro et al., 2011). There are no recognized subtypes beyond variations in the extent of cortical damage. In untreated cases, denial may persist indefinitely, impacting rehabilitation potential and safety. Formal diagnostic criteria include demonstration of objective visual loss on perimetry alongside persistent denial of blindness even when probed. In special populations (e.g., aphasic or cognitively impaired patients), anosognosia may be under-recognized.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach begins with careful history\u2014eliciting patient\u2019s own description of vision. Clinical examination entails confrontation visual fields, bedside testing of object recognition, and pupillary responses. First-tier imaging with non-contrast CT may reveal bilateral occipital hypodensities; MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is gold standard (sensitivity >95%, specificity >90%) for acute infarction (AHA/ASA 2018 Guideline, Class I, Level B). Perfusion MRI or CT perfusion can identify penumbral tissue. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) demonstrate absence of cortical responses. Neuropsychological testing quantifies anosognosia severity (e.g., Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia adapted for vision). Second-tier investigations include functional MRI to assess fronto-occipital connectivity; third-tier may involve transcranial magnetic stimulation research protocols. Pre-test probability is high in bilateral occipital stroke. Pitfalls include malingering, where pupillary and VEP testing remain intact.","management_principles":"Management focuses on treating underlying etiology\u2014typically acute ischemic stroke. According to AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level A), thrombolysis within 4.5 hours and endovascular therapy up to 24 hours (DAWN/DEFUSE 3 criteria) can salvage occipital cortex. Secondary prevention with antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily, clopidogrel in dual therapy for 21 days post-TIA), statin therapy (atorvastatin 40\u201380 mg), and risk factor modification is standard. There is no specific treatment for anosognosia; cognitive rehabilitation techniques employ error-awareness training, metacognitive feedback, and environmental adaptation. Low\u2010vision aids and occupational therapy improve safety. In refractory denial, supportive psychotherapy and caregiver education are essential. No pharmacologic agents (e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors) have proven efficacy in anosognosia (Level C evidence).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes neurological assessments at 24 hours, 7 days, and 90 days post-stroke (mRS scoring). Visual field testing should be repeated at 1 month and 6 months to monitor any recovery. Cognitive assessments for anosognosia and depression (PHQ-9) at 3 and 6 months guide rehabilitation intensity. Imaging follow-up with MRI at 3 months assesses cortical atrophy. Long-term care involves multidisciplinary teams with neurology, neuropsychology, ophthalmology, and occupational therapy. Prognostic factors include age, extent of occipital damage, presence of comorbid neglect, and rehabilitation engagement. Early recognition of denial expedites caregiver education and safety planning. Transition of care to outpatient stroke clinics with visual rehabilitation services is recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. Anton\u2019s syndrome = cortical blindness + denial of blindness despite evidence; hallmark of bilateral occipital infarction. Mnemonic: \u201cAnton sees nothing, yet he sees it all.\u201d\n2. Denial persists even when confronted with flashing lights or collision with objects\u2014differentiates from malingering (pupillary and VEP testing normal in malingering, absent in cortical blindness).\n3. Up to 30% of cortical blindness patients exhibit visual anosognosia; early MRI-DWI is key (sensitivity >95%) to identify bilateral occipital lesions.\n4. Management of anosognosia focuses on environmental adaptations and metacognitive rehabilitation\u2014pharmacotherapy has no proven benefit.\n5. Prognosis depends on collateral circulation in PCA territory; rarely, partial recovery of vision occurs over months, but denial may persist, requiring ongoing support.","references":"1.
