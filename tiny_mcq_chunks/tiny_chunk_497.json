Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that 6 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan terminates cluster attacks in approximately 75% of patients at 15 minutes (Schindler et al., 2015). Verapamil and lithium are used as preventive agents rather than for acute relief. Oral prednisone can serve as a transitional prophylactic measure but is not first\u2010line for acute abortive therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Cluster headache is a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia characterized by strictly unilateral severe pain, associated autonomic features, and circadian periodicity. Acute therapy targets trigeminal nociceptive transmission and the cranial parasympathetic reflex arc, whereas preventive agents modulate cortical excitability and autonomic outflow.","pathophysiology":"Cluster headache involves activation of the trigeminal\u2010autonomic reflex, with hypothalamic dysfunction driving parasympathetic outflow. Sumatriptan is a 5-HT1B/1D agonist that constricts cranial blood vessels and inhibits trigeminal peptide release, aborting attacks rapidly.","clinical_manifestation":"Attacks last 15\u2013180 minutes, occur up to eight times per day, with severe, stabbing peri\u2010orbital pain and ipsilateral autonomic signs (lachrymation, nasal congestion). They often follow circadian rhythms and seasonal patterns.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical per ICHD-3 criteria: \u22655 attacks, unilateral orbital pain lasting 15\u2013180 minutes, ipsilateral autonomic symptoms, frequency 1\u20138 per day, and not better accounted for by another disorder.","management_principles":"First\u2010line acute: subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg or high\u2010flow oxygen (12\u201315 L/min for 15 minutes). Transitional: oral prednisone taper. Preventive: verapamil up to 960 mg daily, with ECG monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor attack frequency and response, assess cardiovascular risk before high\u2010dose verapamil, repeat ECG every 3\u20136 months.

NSAIDs carry a risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus when used in the third trimester and are generally avoided after 30 weeks\u2019 gestation. Opioids may lead to maternal sedation, neonatal respiratory depression, and potential for dependence, and are reserved for refractory cases. Triptans, particularly sumatriptan, have reassuring data in pregnancy but are considered second\u2010line after simple analgesics based on guideline consensus (AHS 2016).","conceptual_foundation":"Analgesic selection in pregnancy balances maternal benefit against fetal risk. Acetaminophen crosses the placenta but lacks teratogenicity at therapeutic doses (Metz et al. 2002). NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, risking fetal renal impairment and premature ductus closure. Opioids activate \u03bc\u2010receptors centrally but may cause neonatal withdrawal. Triptans are 5\u2010HT1B/1D agonists with vasoconstrictive properties; limited human studies show no significant increase in malformation rates but data remain less robust than acetaminophen.","pathophysiology":"Migraine pain arises from activation of the trigeminovascular system and release of vasoactive peptides (CGRP, substance P) leading to vasodilation and neurogenic inflammation. Acetaminophen\u2019s mechanism is thought to involve central COX inhibition and serotonergic pathways modulation, reducing prostaglandin production without impacting platelet function or uterine blood flow, thus preserving fetal hemodynamics.","clinical_manifestation":"In pregnancy, migraine frequency often decreases due to hormonal stabilization, yet attacks that occur are managed with safe abortive therapies. Acetaminophen provides relief in mild\u2010to\u2010moderate attacks; dosing of up to 3\u2009g/day is considered safe. Headache characteristics remain typical: unilateral throbbing, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on ICHD\u20103 criteria. In pregnancy, secondary causes (pre\u2010eclampsia, intracranial hemorrhage) must be excluded if red flags present. No change in diagnostic imaging thresholds, although MRI is preferred over CT to avoid ionizing radiation.","management_principles":"First\u2010line: acetaminophen 500\u20131000\u2009mg q6h PRN (max 3\u2009g/day). If inadequate, consider metoclopramide for nausea and prokinetic effect. Sumatriptan may be added if necessary. Avoid NSAIDs after 30 weeks. Opioids only for refractory cases under close supervision.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess headache frequency and medication use monthly. Monitor for medication\u2010overuse headache. Coordinate with obstetrics for fetal monitoring if polypharmacy is required. Educate on nonpharmacologic measures: hydration, regular sleep, relaxation techniques.","clinical_pearls":"1) Acetaminophen is safe throughout pregnancy when used appropriately. 2) Avoid NSAIDs after week 30 due to ductus arteriosus risk. 3) Sumatriptan has the most pregnancy data among triptans. 4) Screen for red flags to exclude secondary headache. 5) Educate on lifestyle triggers and nonpharmacologic prophylaxis.","references":"1.
