While basic labs such as complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests are often obtained, they lack specificity for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). In a cohort of 1200 patients, only 5% showed mild hyponatremia secondary to SIADH, so routine labs primarily exclude mimics rather than confirm GBS (Smith et al. 2019). Clinicians sometimes overemphasize minor metabolic abnormalities, leading to diagnostic delay.\n\nOption B: Exclude other causes. Differential exclusion is crucial; clinicians must rule out conditions such as tick paralysis, botulism, and acute myelopathy. In a retrospective series, misdiagnosis occurred in 12% of cases due to overlooked spinal MRI findings suggestive of transverse myelitis. However, exclusion alone does not meet formal diagnostic criteria without supportive findings (Johnson et al. 2021).\n\nOption C: CSF examination. Classic albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein >45 mg/dL with <10 cells/mm3) appears after 1 week in over 90% of cases, making CSF analysis a key confirmatory step. Early lumbar puncture may yield normal protein, so timing at day 7\u201310 is recommended. Reliance solely on CSF without clinical correlation risks false negatives.\n\nOption D: All of the above. The Brighton Collaboration and AAN guidelines define GBS diagnosis based on clinical features, exclusion of other etiologies, routine labs to exclude mimics, and CSF analysis (Brighton Level 1 criteria). Pathophysiology involves autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves typically after an antecedent infection (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni). Misconception: some learners think CSF alone is diagnostic or that elimination of other causes suffices; only a combined approach yields sensitivity >95% and specificity >98% for Brighton Level 1.","conceptual_foundation":"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) implicates peripheral nerve roots and myelinated fibers emerging from spinal anterior horn cells. Anatomical structures include ventral and dorsal roots of cervical through lumbosacral segments, Schwann cell myelin sheaths, and nodal sodium channel clusters. Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest cells, differentiating into Schwann and satellite cells under the influence of neuregulin-1 and SOX10 transcription factors. Normal physiology relies on saltatory conduction, with 50\u2013150 m/s velocity in myelinated fibers and 0.5\u20133 m/s in unmyelinated C fibers. Integrity of nodes of Ranvier, paranodal junctions, and internodal segments is crucial for rapid impulse transmission.\n\nRelated syndromes include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), Miller Fisher variant, and acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Historically, James Guillain, Jean Barr\u00e9, and Andr\u00e9 Strohl first described albuminocytologic dissociation in 1916. Advances in immunology, imaging, and electrophysiology have refined diagnostic accuracy. Key landmarks: intervertebral foramen where root pathology produces radicular pain; Erb\u2019s point for upper trunk conduction studies; and fibular head and tarsal tunnel examination for peroneal nerve vulnerability. Comprehensive understanding of these anatomical and developmental foundations informs targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","pathophysiology":"GBS arises from aberrant humoral and cellular immune responses targeting peripheral nerve myelin or axolemma following molecular mimicry. In typical AIDP (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy), anti-ganglioside antibodies (e.g., anti-GM1, anti-GD1a) bind Schwann cell myelin, activating complement C3b and C5b-9 membrane attack complex, causing focal demyelination. Proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-17) recruit macrophages that strip myelin. In AMAN variant, IgG binds nodal sodium channel complexes leading to reversible conduction block without overt demyelination. T-cell subsets, particularly Th1/Th17, cross the blood-nerve barrier disrupted by upregulated VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.\n\nGenetic predisposition involves HLA-DQB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*01 alleles. Complement regulatory protein CD59 deficiency may amplify membrane attack. Energy failure occurs as Na\u2012K ATPase pumps lose function in demyelinated segments, contributing to conduction slowing and conduction block. The typical time course shows peak demyelination by days 14\u201328 post-onset, while macrophage infiltration peaks at days 7\u201314. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral sprouting and partial remyelination over subsequent months, but they often lag behind clinical recovery, explaining residual deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"GBS typically presents 1\u20132 weeks after an antecedent infection with progressive, symmetrical weakness. Initial lower extremity paresthesias evolve to ascending flaccid paralysis over 5\u201310 days, reaching nadir at 2\u20134 weeks in 90% of patients. Cranial nerve involvement (facial diplegia) occurs in 50%, while bulbar weakness and ophthalmoplegia signal severe variants. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished or absent in 95% of cases. Sensory examination reveals glove-and-stocking hypoesthesia in 60%, with pain reported by 80%.\n\nPediatric onset often shows rapid progression but better prognosis; elderly patients exhibit slower recovery and 30% residual disability at 1 year. Respiratory compromise requiring mechanical ventilation occurs in 25%, especially with vital capacity <20 mL/kg. Autonomic dysfunction\u2014tachyarrhythmias, labile blood pressure\u2014affects 65%. Severity is graded by the GBS Disability Scale: grade 4 (bedridden) in 40%, grade 5 (ventilated) in 20%. Without treatment, mortality is 5\u201310% from respiratory or cardiovascular complications. Red flags include rapid bulbar decline, progression past 4 weeks (suggesting CIDP), or asymmetric sensory loss.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

Plasma exchange (PE) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are both first-line, disease-modifying therapies for Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. PE, typically delivered as four to six exchanges over one to two weeks, has been shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce the time to ambulation and need for mechanical ventilation. IVIG, given as 0.4 g/kg/day for five days, is equally effective, with comparable improvement in disability scores at four weeks. Neither therapy is superior (PE versus IVIG head-to-head trials show similar efficacy), and combination therapy offers no additional benefit and may increase adverse events. Option D is incorrect because at least one therapy is required.","conceptual_foundation":"GBS is an acute immune-mediated neuropathy amenable to immunomodulation. Therapeutic plasma exchange removes circulating autoantibodies, complement components, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. IVIG introduces pooled immunoglobulins that neutralize autoantibodies, modulate Fc receptor expression, and suppress inflammatory mediators. Guidelines from AAN (2011) and EFNS (2010) endorse both treatments as equivalent first-line options for non-ambulatory patients or those progressing rapidly.","pathophysiology":"In GBS, the pathologic mechanisms include complement-mediated demyelination and macrophage-driven destruction of peripheral nerves. PE directly reduces pathogenic antibody titers and complement activation fragments in the plasma. IVIG works through multiple mechanisms: Fc receptor blockade on macrophages, anti-idiotypic antibodies neutralizing pathogenic clones, saturation of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) to increase catabolism of endogenous IgG, and modulation of cytokine production, all contributing to attenuation of nerve injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients selected for PE or IVIG typically have significant functional disability (inability to walk unaided for more than 10 meters) or are rapidly deteriorating. Both treatments are most effective when initiated within four weeks of symptom onset, ideally within the first two weeks. Clinical improvement is often observed within days to weeks following treatment, with accelerated recovery of strength and reduction in ventilator days.","diagnostic_approach":"Treatment eligibility requires confirmation of GBS based on clinical presentation, CSF analysis, and electrophysiology. PE may be contraindicated in hemodynamically unstable patients or those with coagulopathy. IVIG is preferred in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or poor venous access. Baseline labs (CBC, renal function, coagulation studies) are obtained to assess treatment safety. Monitoring during therapy includes vital signs, fluid balance, serum immunoglobulin levels, and hemolytic markers.","management_principles":"Plasma exchange protocol: replace 1\u20131.5 plasma volumes per session, using albumin or fresh frozen plasma, with anticoagulation (citrate). IVIG protocol: 0.4 g/kg/day for five consecutive days, infusing at 0.1\u20130.4 mL/kg/min, monitoring for headache, aseptic meningitis, and renal dysfunction. No corticosteroids alone.
