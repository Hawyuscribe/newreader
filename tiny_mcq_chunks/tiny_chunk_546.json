[{"question_number":"2","question":"In the case of PML (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy) occurring in patients treated with Natalizumab, what is the appropriate treatment?","options":["IVIG","Steroid","Plasmapheresis"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Plasmapheresis","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) is the standard of care for natalizumab-associated PML as it rapidly clears natalizumab from the circulation, restores immune surveillance, and allows control of JC virus. Neither IVIG nor corticosteroids directly promote JC virus clearance. IVIG lacks antiviral efficacy against JC virus, and steroids further suppress immune function, worsening viral proliferation. Multiple case series and expert consensus (AAN, 2016) demonstrate that performing 3\u20135 plasma exchanges over 7\u201310 days reduces natalizumab levels by >90%, correlates with earlier immune reconstitution, and stabilizes or improves neurological deficits.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic demyelinating disease caused by reactivation of JC polyomavirus in the setting of impaired CNS immune surveillance. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against \u03b14-integrin, blocking leukocyte migration across the blood\u2013brain barrier. ICD-11 classifies PML under \u2018viral infections of the central nervous system.\u2019 Differential diagnoses include MS relapse, CNS lymphoma, and other viral encephalitides. Historically, PML was confined to HIV/AIDS; the advent of monoclonal therapies such as natalizumab introduced new risk cohorts.","pathophysiology":"JC virus remains latent in kidneys and lymphoid tissue. Natalizumab impairs \u03b14\u03b21-integrin\u2013mediated leukocyte adhesion to VCAM-1, reducing T-cell surveillance in the CNS. This immunosuppression allows lytic infection of oligodendrocytes, leading to multifocal demyelination. Plasmapheresis mechanically removes circulating natalizumab, restoring integrin function, enabling T-cell CNS ingress, and facilitating viral containment.","clinical_manifestation":"Natalizumab-associated PML presents subacutely over days to weeks with focal neurological deficits (hemiparesis, visual field cuts, aphasia), ataxia, and cognitive changes. MRI reveals multifocal, often non-enhancing, T2/FLAIR hyperintense white matter lesions without mass effect. CSF JC virus PCR confirms diagnosis with sensitivity ~75\u201390% and specificity >95%. Untreated, PML rapidly progresses to severe disability or death.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line diagnosis includes brain MRI and CSF JC virus PCR. MRI sensitivity approaches 95% for PML lesions; CSF PCR specificity is >95%. Brain biopsy is reserved for PCR-negative but high-clinical-suspicion cases. Risk stratification prior to natalizumab initiation includes anti-JC antibody index and baseline MRI.","management_principles":"Management centers on immediate discontinuation of natalizumab and initiation of plasma exchange (3\u20135 sessions). Supportive therapies may include mefloquine and mirtazapine (off-label) to inhibit JC virus. Corticosteroids are contraindicated except to treat IRIS, which can occur after immune reconstitution and manifests as new contrast enhancement and edema; IRIS is managed with short-course steroids.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical status and repeat MRI at 4\u20136-week intervals to assess lesion evolution. Repeat CSF PCR until JC virus is undetectable. Observe for IRIS, typically 2\u20138 weeks post-exchange; treat with corticosteroids if severe. Long-term care focuses on neurorehabilitation and secondary prevention.","clinical_pearls":"1) Plasma exchange clears natalizumab within 2 weeks, enabling immune recovery; 2) Early MRI lesions in PML are characteristically nonenhancing, distinguishing them from MS plaques; 3) JC virus CSF PCR false negatives occur in ~10\u201325%\u2014repeat testing if clinical suspicion remains high; 4) IRIS after natalizumab removal may mimic PML progression\u2014treat IRIS, not PML, with steroids; 5) Anti-JC virus antibody index stratifies PML risk: index >1.5 correlates with annual incidence >1/100.","references":"1.

Brain volume loss reflects irreversible neuroaxonal damage. Longitudinal studies (e.g., PRISMS trial extension) show that annualized brain volume loss >0.5% correlates with EDSS worsening and cognitive decline. Gadolinium-enhancing lesions and T2 lesion count correlate poorly with long-term disability once treatment is initiated.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral atrophy in MS arises from cumulative demyelination, axonal transection, and neurodegeneration. It can be measured by brain parenchymal fraction on T1-weighted volumetric MRI. Atrophy rate in healthy adults is ~0.1%/year; in MS patients it ranges 0.5\u20131.35%/year.","pathophysiology":"Neurodegeneration in MS involves mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity, and microglial activation leading to neuronal loss. Atrophy reflects both focal lesion\u2013related axonal loss and diffuse pathology in normal-appearing white and gray matter.","clinical_manifestation":"Greater rates of global and regional (e.g., thalamic) atrophy predict motor disability, cognitive impairment, and fatigue.

In the evaluation of suspected autoimmune myelopathy, obtaining MRI of the spinal cord (and often the brain) is standard practice. Spinal MRI is required to confirm the presence, location, and extent of inflammatory lesions, to exclude compressive or structural lesions (e.g., tumor, spondylosis), and to help distinguish among etiologies such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, MOG-IgG myelitis, sarcoid myelitis, and parainfectious or paraneoplastic causes. Option A is incorrect because MRI is not optional; omitting imaging risks missing alternative diagnoses. Option C is incorrect because MRI is not contraindicated\u2014it is safe and essential. Option D is incorrect because MRI is indicated even in mild or early presentations, not only in severe cases.","conceptual_foundation":"Autoimmune myelopathy refers to inflammatory spinal cord syndromes caused by autoimmunity (most commonly MS, NMOSD, MOGAD). The diagnostic approach begins by establishing inflammatory myelopathy through clinical features (sensory level, motor weakness, sphincter dysfunction), laboratory evaluation (CSF analysis for pleocytosis, OCBs, specific antibodies), and crucially, imaging. MRI uses T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced sequences to identify hyperintense lesions in the cord. In current nosology (ICD-11), inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS include multiple sclerosis (8A60), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (8A60.10), and MOG antibody-associated disease (8A60.Z). Differentials include vascular myelopathies, compressive lesions, infectious myelitis, and metabolic etiologies.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the spinal cord is protected by the blood\u2013spinal cord barrier. In autoimmune myelopathies, pathogenic autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells breach this barrier, leading to focal demyelination, inflammatory cell infiltration, and axonal injury. MRI detects these focal areas of increased water content as T2 hyperintensities and contrast enhancement where the blood\u2013spinal cord barrier is disrupted. The extent and location of lesions correlate with clinical symptoms.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely to subacutely with sensory level, varying degrees of motor weakness (paraparesis or quadriparesis depending on lesion level), neuropathic pain, and sphincter dysfunction. Onset can range from hours to weeks. MS myelitis often has a relapsing course with shorter lesions (<3 vertebral segments), whereas NMOSD/MOGAD typically present with longitudinally extensive lesions (\u22653 segments).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI of the entire spinal cord with T1, T2, STIR, and contrast sequences. Brain MRI is often obtained concurrently to look for MS-typical lesions. CSF analysis for cell count, protein, OCBs, and relevant antibodies (AQP4-IgG, MOG-IgG). Second-tier: Additional blood tests for sarcoidosis (ACE, lysozyme), infectious panels. Nerve conduction if peripheral process suspected.","management_principles":"Acute management of inflammatory myelopathy includes high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3\u20135 days). If poor response, plasma exchange is indicated. Long-term immunotherapy depends on etiology: MS disease-modifying therapies (e.g., interferon-\u03b2, natalizumab) for MS; rituximab, eculizumab, or inebilizumab for NMOSD; and corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants for MOGAD.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up MRI at 3\u20136 months to assess lesion resolution or new activity. Clinical re-evaluation every 3\u20136 months with exam and EDSS scoring for MS. Monitor for adverse effects of immunotherapy with regular labs (CBC, LFTs).","clinical_pearls":"1. Always image the spinal cord in suspected myelopathy to rule out compression. 2. Longitudinally extensive lesions (\u22653 segments) suggest NMOSD/MOGAD rather than MS. 3. Negative AQP4/MOG antibodies do not exclude non-MS etiologies\u2014CSF OCBs and pleocytosis are helpful. 4. Early plasma exchange improves outcomes in steroid-refractory cases. 5. Coexistent brain lesions on MRI increase likelihood of MS over 15-year risk.","references":"1. Thompson AJ, et al. Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 2017 revisions of the McDonald criteria.

Younger age (A), absence of disease-modifying treatment (B), and presence of T2 lesions (C) have all been shown in cohort studies (e.g., MSBase registry analyses) to predict more rapid EDSS worsening in high-risk CIS. Option A is correct because younger patients at CIS onset often have higher inflammatory activity, correlating with shorter time to irreversible disability (Goodin et al., 2012). Option B is correct as early initiation of DMT slows conversion to clinically definite MS and delays EDSS progression (Coles et al., 2017). Option C is correct because baseline MRI burden of T2 lesions correlates with long-term disability accrual (Sormani et al., 2009). None of these factors alone fully accounts for prognosis, but together they synergistically predict rapid progression, making \u201cAll of the above\u201d the most accurate choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) refers to the first clinical demyelinating event suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). According to the 2017 McDonald criteria (Thompson et al., 2018), dissemination in space and time on MRI or clinical relapse is required to establish MS. High-risk CIS is characterized by clinical features and MRI findings (T2 lesions, gadolinium-enhancing lesions) that meet dissemination in space. Younger age at onset (<30 years) is associated with active inflammatory disease. Untreated CIS frequently evolves into relapsing-remitting MS; early DMT reduces relapse rate by ~50% and delays EDSS progression (Kappos et al., 2016). Diagnostically, presence of \u22652 T2 lesions in typical MS locations (periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal) fulfills dissemination in space and portends worse prognosis.","pathophysiology":"MS pathophysiology involves immune-mediated demyelination and axonal injury in the central nervous system. In CIS, focal lesions form due to T-cell infiltration, microglial activation, and blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. Younger patients have more robust inflammatory responses, leading to more frequent lesion formation. T2 lesion burden on MRI reflects cumulative demyelination and gliosis. Without DMT, ongoing inflammation accelerates axonal transection and neurodegeneration, causing irreversible disability. Early treatment modulates cytokine profiles, reduces lesion formation by up to 70% (Comi et al., 2012), and preserves neuronal integrity.","clinical_manifestation":"CIS typically presents with optic neuritis (painful monocular visual loss), transverse myelitis (sensory level, motor weakness), or brainstem syndromes. Approximately 50\u201380% of CIS patients have asymptomatic T2 lesions on MRI at presentation. Younger patients more often present with optic neuritis. Without treatment, ~60\u201370% convert to clinically definite MS within 10 years; early DMT reduces this to ~30% (Jacobs et al., 2000). Disability accrual, measured by EDSS, correlates with relapse frequency and lesion burden.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation of CIS includes brain and spinal MRI with and without gadolinium, visual evoked potentials if optic neuritis is suspected, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for oligoclonal bands. MRI sensitivity for detecting MS-like lesions approaches 90% (Filippi et al., 2016). Second-tier tests include optical coherence tomography (to assess retinal nerve fiber layer thinning) and advanced MRI techniques (magnetization transfer ratio). Pretest probability is high when clinical syndrome is typical and MRI shows \u22652 T2 lesions.","management_principles":"According to 2018 AAN practice guideline, initiation of DMT after CIS is indicated if MRI shows \u22652 T2 lesions or CSF oligoclonal bands (Level A). First-line agents include interferon-\u03b2 and glatiramer acetate, which reduce conversion to MS by ~50% (Jacobs et al., 2000). Early treatment within 6 months of CIS onset yields greater reduction in 5-year EDSS progression (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35\u20130.86). Escalation to high-efficacy therapies (natalizumab, alemtuzumab) is reserved for breakthrough disease.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes clinical visits every 6 months with EDSS assessment, annual brain MRI to monitor new or enlarging lesions, and laboratory monitoring of therapy-specific safety parameters (CBC for interferon-\u03b2 every 3 months). Visual function and cognitive screening are recommended yearly. Long-term DMT is advised for at least 5 years or until sustained disease stability (no relapses, no new lesions).","clinical_pearls":"1. Early DMT after CIS reduces conversion to MS by ~50% (Jacobs et al., 2000). 2. Younger age at onset predicts higher lesion activity but slower long-term disability accrual. 3. Presence of \u22652 T2 lesions confers high risk for MS conversion. 4. Serial MRI is crucial: new lesions often precede clinical relapse. 5.
