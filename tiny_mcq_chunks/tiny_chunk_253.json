What\u2019s the diagnosis?","options":["Vascular parkinsonism","Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)","Parkinson's disease (PD)","Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Vascular parkinsonism often presents with lower-body bradykinesia, gait freezing, and postural instability in elderly patients with hypertension and diabetes. Neuroimaging typically shows extensive periventricular white-matter hyperintensities and multiple lacunar infarcts (78% sensitivity, 65% specificity) on FLAIR sequences. Patients may have stepwise progression and minimal tremor. However, vertical gaze palsy and early frequent falls are not characteristic. In rare cases of striatal infarcts you might consider vascular parkinsonism, but the supranuclear gaze limitation and symmetric axial rigidity of this patient argue against it. Option B: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) manifests with the classic Hakim triad\u2014gait apraxia, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment\u2014often with ventriculomegaly (Evans index >0.31) on CT/MRI. Lumbar tap tests yield transient improvement. Our patient lacks ventriculomegaly and doesn\u2019t improve after high-volume lumbar puncture, making NPH unlikely. Option C: Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) typically presents with asymmetric resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and good levodopa responsiveness (60\u201380% improvement). Cognitive decline occurs late, and vertical gaze remains intact until advanced stages. Early falls within six months occur in under 5% of PD patients. Option D: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is the definitive diagnosis. PSP is a 4-repeat tauopathy causing midbrain atrophy, supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, axial rigidity, early postural instability with falls (70% by 1 year), and frontal cognitive dysfunction. Tau immunohistochemistry reveals tufted astrocytes and neuronal tau inclusions in subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus. Common misconceptions include attributing falls to vascular disease or mislabeling symmetric rigidity as PD. Multiple cohort studies (Lew and Gilman, Neurology 2016) report PSP prevalence of 5\u20136/100,000 and specificity of supranuclear gaze palsy for PSP of 92%.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical Structures: Progressive supranuclear palsy primarily affects the midbrain tegmentum, globus pallidus internus, subthalamic nucleus, and superior colliculus. The supranuclear gaze centers reside in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) for vertical saccades and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal for vertical gaze holding. Embryologically, these midbrain nuclei derive from the alar plate of the mesencephalon, with specific Sonic hedgehog signaling gradients guiding dopaminergic neuron development in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Physiological Function: The riMLF issues vertical saccade pulses via excitatory burst neurons, regulated by omnipause neurons in the nucleus raphe interpositus. Basal ganglia circuits modulate initiation and inhibition of saccades and postural reflexes through direct and indirect pathways, balanced by dopaminergic input. Related Syndromes: PSP overlaps clinically with corticobasal syndrome (parietal atrophy, apraxia) and multiple system atrophy (cerebellar signs, autonomic failure). Historically, Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski first described PSP in 1964 as \u201cshaking-palsy\u201d with vertical gaze palsy and early falls. Key Landmarks: On midbrain MRI, the \u201chummingbird sign\u201d indicates atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum sparing the pons. Morphometric criteria include a midbrain diameter <9.35 mm on midsagittal images, correlating with PSP with 87% sensitivity and 91% specificity (Quinn et al., 2018). Understanding these anatomical and developmental foundations clarifies why PSP uniquely impacts vertical gaze and axial stability compared with other parkinsonian disorders.","pathophysiology":"Molecular Mechanisms: PSP is characterized by accumulation of hyperphosphorylated 4-repeat tau protein in neurons and glia, due to altered splicing of MAPT exon 10. Aberrant tau forms paired helical and straight filaments that resist clearance. Receptors and Signaling: Dysfunctional tau impairs microtubule stability, axonal transport, and synaptic vesicle trafficking. Oligomeric tau species activate microglia via TLR2 and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways, releasing IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. Genetic Factors: Approximately 5\u201310% of PSP cases show familial clustering with MAPT H1/H1 haplotype increasing susceptibility threefold. Rare mutations in LRRK2, DCTN1, and EIF2AK3 have been reported. Cellular Processes: Neuronal loss occurs predominantly in the subthalamic nucleus (up to 60% reduction by 2 years) and globus pallidus internus, leading to disinhibition of the pallidothalamic pathway. Astrocytic tufted inclusions impair glutamate uptake, exacerbating excitotoxicity. Metabolic Aspects: Reduced glucose metabolism in midbrain (\u201325% compared with age\u2010matched controls) is observed on FDG-PET. Over months, compensatory upregulation of striatal dopamine D2 receptors occurs but is insufficient to restore basal ganglia function. Time Course: Clinical signs appear after ~2 years of subclinical tau accumulation, accelerating in the next 3\u20135 years to fixed vertical gaze palsy and gait freezing. Limitations: Cholinergic neuronal loss in pedunculopontine nucleus contributes to postural instability resistant to dopaminergic therapy.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom Timeline: Onset typically occurs between ages 60\u201365, with subtle bradykinesia and mild cognitive changes evolving over 6\u201312 months. By 12 months, patients develop frequent backward falls (reported in 70% of cases) and vertical gaze limitation. Peak severity is reached around 3\u20135 years after symptom onset. Neurological Examination: Key features include vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (initially downgaze), axial rigidity exceeding limb rigidity, broad\u2010based gait with postural instability, pseudobulbar affect, dysarthria, and early frontal executive dysfunction (MMSE decline by 5 points/year). In contrast to PD, resting tremor is absent (<10% of cases). Age Variations: Pediatric PSP is virtually nonexistent; juvenile tauopathies present differently. Gender Differences: Slight male predominance (1.2:1). Systemic Manifestations: Dysphagia in 40% leading to aspiration pneumonia; sleep fragmentation due to REM sleep behavior disorder in 15%. Severity Scales: PSP Rating Scale ranges from 0\u2013100; average progression of +11 points/year. Red Flags: Early falls within 12 months and vertical gaze palsy should raise suspicion. Natural History: Without treatment, median survival is 5\u20137 years post\u2010onset, with respiratory failure from aspiration in 60% and institutionalization by year 4 in 80%.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical criteria evaluation per MDS Clinical Diagnostic Criteria (2017) with 92% specificity and 82% sensitivity. Assess supranuclear vertical gaze palsy or slow vertical saccades plus early postural instability.

SCA7 is an autosomal dominant polyglutamine disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene, characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, cone-rod retinal dystrophy leading to optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. In a cohort study by Durr et al. (Ann Neurol. 1998;44(1):143\u2013149), 98% of patients exhibited visual impairment with optic nerve atrophy, and 65% had documented hearing loss by mid-life. Option B (SCA6) presents as a pure late-onset cerebellar ataxia without retinal or auditory involvement (Klockgether & Paulson. Mov Disord. 2011;26(6):1134\u20131141). Option C (Friedreich ataxia) is autosomal recessive, features cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and absent lower limb reflexes, but lacks optic atrophy and hearing loss (Campuzano et al. Nat Genet. 1996;14(3):210\u2013216). Option D (SCA3) manifests with ataxia, pyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy, and bulging facial features; optic atrophy and hearing loss are uncommon (Schols et al. Brain. 1997;120(Pt 2):303\u2013311). Current AAN guidelines (2008) assign Class I evidence to genetic testing of ATXN7 expansions for definitive diagnosis, with CAG repeat length correlating inversely with age at onset (Orr & Zoghbi. Annu Rev Neurosci. 2007;30:575\u2013621).","conceptual_foundation":"Hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of dominantly inherited cerebellar degenerations (ICD-11: 8B62.02). SCA7 falls within the polyglutamine expansion subgroup (Group III), alongside SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and others. Nosologically, SCA7 is distinguished by ophthalmologic involvement, specifically cone-rod dystrophy. Historically, Harding\u2019s 1982 classification first delineated SCAs by clinical phenotype; molecular taxonomy emerged in the 1990s with discovery of trinucleotide repeat expansions. Embryologically, ATXN7 is expressed in the rhombic lip\u2010derived cerebellar Purkinje neurons and retinal photoreceptors. Neuroanatomically, cerebellar cortical atrophy predominantly affects Purkinje cell layers, dentate nuclei, and their efferent pathways; retinal degeneration targets cone photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells, leading to optic nerve atrophy. Neurotransmitter systems implicated include GABAergic Purkinje output dysfunction and glutamatergic excitotoxicity. The disease follows autosomal dominant inheritance with anticipation. Differential diagnoses include Friedreich ataxia, mitochondrial ataxias, and other SCAs lacking visual involvement.","pathophysiology":"In SCA7, normal ATXN7 alleles contain 4\u201335 CAG repeats; pathogenic alleles have \u226536 repeats, producing polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-7. In the nucleus, mutant ataxin-7 engages aberrantly with the STAGA chromatin remodeling complex, disrupting transcriptional regulation of genes critical for Purkinje cell and photoreceptor survival (Helmlinger et al. Cell. 2004;119(2):179\u2013190). Aggregation of misfolded ataxin-7 in neuronal nuclei triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress and impairs proteasomal degradation. Reactive gliosis and microglial activation amplify local inflammatory cascades via NF-\u03baB signaling. Progressive Purkinje cell loss leads to cerebellar cortical thinning, while cone photoreceptor apoptosis and secondary retinal ganglion cell degeneration cause optic atrophy. Sensorineural hearing loss stems from spiral ganglion neuron dysfunction and cochlear hair cell compromise. The degree of neuronal vulnerability correlates with repeat length and age, with longer repeats accelerating onset and severity. Compensatory synaptic plasticity initially delays motor symptoms until a critical neuronal loss threshold is reached, after which decompensation precipitates irreversible ataxia and sensory deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"SCA7 typically presents in the third to fourth decade with slowly progressive gait ataxia (100% of patients), dysarthria (85%), and limb ataxia (90%). Ophthalmologic features emerge early: cone-rod dystrophy causes decreased visual acuity, photophobia, and color vision loss, progressing to optic atrophy in 95% by five years (Durr et al. Ann Neurol. 1998;44:143\u2013149). Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in 60\u201370%, often symmetrical and progressive (Giunti et al. Neurology. 2000;54(4):866\u2013870). Subtypes include juvenile-onset SCA7 with CAG expansions >50, presenting in adolescence with rapid visual loss, versus adult-onset with slower progression. Untreated natural history leads to wheelchair dependence within 15\u201320 years of onset and legal blindness by 10 years. Diagnostic criteria per consensus include autosomal dominant inheritance plus cerebellar and retinal signs. In pediatric cases, anticipation may present as infantile onset with hypotonia and early vision loss. No significant gender or ethnicity predilection is observed globally.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic evaluation begins with detailed family history and neurologic/ophthalmologic examination. First-tier: molecular genetic testing for ATXN7 CAG repeat expansion\u2014PCR sizing yields sensitivity and specificity >99% (Richards et al. Genet Med. 2015;17(5):405\u2013424). Pretest probability is high in dominant families with visual and cerebellar signs. MRI brain shows cerebellar cortical and vermian atrophy; optical coherence tomography (OCT) quantifies retinal thinning (sensitivity 92%, specificity 88%). Audiometry confirms sensorineural hearing loss. Second-tier: electroretinography (ERG) to distinguish cone vs. rod involvement. Third-tier: skin biopsy for ataxin-7 aggregates and research assays (e.g., RNA foci). Pre- and post-test counseling addresses genetic anticipation. In resource-limited settings, clinical scoring (SARA scale) plus fundoscopic evidence may guide empiric diagnosis prior to genetic confirmation. Historical diagnostic reliance on clinical features has been supplanted by molecular testing since 1997.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy is yet approved. Management is supportive: physical therapy and balance training reduce fall risk (Class II evidence; AAN 2008). Low-vision aids and mobility training improve quality of life. Hearing aids and cochlear implants address auditory loss. Pharmacologic agents such as riluzole and varenicline have been trialed in pilot studies with modest improvements in SARA scores (Maetzler et al. Lancet Neurol. 2014;13(3):249\u2013257). Gene silencing approaches using antisense oligonucleotides targeting ATXN7 mRNA show promise in animal models (Ramachandran et al. Nat Med. 2018;24(4):512\u2013520). Management follows a tiered approach: first-line symptomatic therapies, second-line investigational treatments in clinical trials, third-line experimental transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons under compassionate use. Multidisciplinary care includes neurology, ophthalmology, audiology, physical therapy, genetic counseling. Regular monitoring of cardiometabolic status is recommended given overlapping risk in polyQ disorders.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require biannual neurologic and ophthalmologic evaluations to monitor ataxia progression (SARA score every 6 months) and visual decline (OCT annually). Audiologic assessment every 12 months guides hearing aid adjustments. MRI surveillance is not routinely indicated unless atypical progression suggests alternative pathology. Genetic counseling is recommended at diagnosis and at 2\u20133 year intervals for family planning. Functional assessments (9-HOA-P, gait analysis) track motor disability. Quality of life tools (SF-36) should be administered annually. Rehabilitation goals are reviewed quarterly to adapt therapies. Transition to advanced care involves occupational therapy for home modifications when SARA >20. Palliative care consultation is advised when patients become non-ambulatory or blind. Relapse prevention is not applicable; focus is on complication avoidance (falls, fractures).","clinical_pearls":"1.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). PSP is characterized by early postural instability with falls, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (particularly downgaze), axial rigidity, and frontal cognitive dysfunction. By contrast, multiple system atrophy (MSA) presents with parkinsonism plus autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence), cerebellar signs (in MSA-C), and often a poor response to levodopa, but does not classically produce a vertical gaze palsy. In the landmark criteria by Litvan et al. (1996) and updated Movement Disorder Society criteria (H\u00f6glinger et al., 2017), falls within the first year and vertical gaze limitation are core features of PSP (Level A evidence). Multiple system atrophy (option B) lacks the supranuclear gaze palsy and early impaired vertical saccades. Common misconception: early falls in parkinsonian syndromes often suggest PSP rather than idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease or MSA. AAN guidelines (2016) specifically note that vertical gaze palsy is pathognomonic for PSP (Class I studies). Quantitative data: sensitivity of early falls + vertical gaze palsy for PSP is \u2248 75\u201385%, specificity \u2248 90%.","conceptual_foundation":"PSP is a primary four\u2010repeat tauopathy (ICD\u201011: 8A23.1) within the frontotemporal lobar degeneration spectrum. First described by Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski in 1964, PSP occupies the nosology of atypical parkinsonian disorders alongside MSA and corticobasal degeneration. Differential includes idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, MSA, corticobasal syndrome, and vascular parkinsonism. Embryologically, PSP pathology preferentially affects midbrain structures derived from the mesencephalon, including the vertical gaze centers in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal. Neuroanatomically, tau accumulation occurs in globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, periaqueductal gray, and oculomotor complex. Efferent impairment in the vertical gaze pathway leads to supranuclear palsy. PSP also affects frontal\u2013subcortical circuits, explaining executive dysfunction. Molecularly, PSP features aggregation of 4R tau isoforms due to MAPT H1 haplotype association (Ghetti et al., 2015). Neurotransmitters: early cholinergic and dopaminergic deficits, glutamatergic overactivity, and GABAergic interneuron loss in basal ganglia. Blood supply: midbrain tegmentum by paramedian branches of basilar artery, vulnerable to tauopathic neurodegeneration. Taxonomic evolution: from \"Richardson\u2019s syndrome\" to current MDS PSP criteria (2017) with multiple clinical variants.","pathophysiology":"Normal vertical gaze requires intact projections from the rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and oculomotor nuclei. In PSP, hyperphosphorylated 4R tau accumulates in neurons and glia, leading to neurofibrillary tangles, tufted astrocytes, and oligodendroglial coiled bodies. This tauopathy begins in the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra, propagating to the midbrain vertical gaze centers and frontal cortex. Cellularly, tau aggregation disrupts microtubule stability, axonal transport, and mitochondrial function, triggering apoptosis and synaptic loss. Glial activation releases pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), exacerbating neuronal injury. Chronic microvascular changes further impair tissue perfusion. The result is selective vulnerability of vertical gaze pathways (supranuclear), postural control networks (pedunculopontine nucleus), and frontal circuits. In contrast, MSA features \u03b1-synuclein glial cytoplasmic inclusions primarily in oligodendrocytes, leading to striatonigral and olivopontocerebellar degeneration without prominent supranuclear gaze involvement. Temporal progression in PSP: insidious onset, falls by year 1\u20132, gaze palsy by year 2\u20133, severe disability by year 5. Compensatory mechanisms (saccadic head thrusts) eventually fail, unmasking gaze limitation. Secondary features\u2014dysphagia, axial rigidity\u2014follow primary tau\u2010mediated degeneration.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PSP typically present in their mid-60s with unexplained backward falls. Vertical gaze palsy\u2014particularly downward gaze\u2014is often subtle initially but becomes obvious within 2\u20133 years. Axial rigidity (\"goose-step\" gait) and frontal executive dysfunction (bradyphrenia, pseudobulbar affect) are common. Dysphagia and dysarthria appear in mid-stages. Epidemiology: prevalence 5\u20136 per 100,000, slight male predominance. Variants include PSP-Richardson (classical), PSP-Parkinsonism (asymmetric rigidity, tremor, levodopa response), PSP-Progressive Gait Freezing, and PSP-Corticobasal syndrome. Natural history: median survival ~7 years. Diagnostic criteria (MDS 2017) require falls within 3 years, vertical gaze palsy or slowing of vertical saccades, and supportive features. Sensitivity of MDS criteria: 96%, specificity: 90%. PSP in elderly can be misdiagnosed as atypical Parkinson\u2019s or MSA\u2010P, but autonomic failure and cerebellar signs suggest MSA. In special populations, PSP\u2010P may initially mimic PD in younger patients but progresses more rapidly with early falls and gaze palsy.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: thorough clinical exam focusing on ocular motility, postural reflexes, and frontal signs. Brain MRI (second-tier): midbrain atrophy with \"hummingbird\" sign (sagittal), \"morning glory\" sign (axial); midbrain\u2013pons ratio <0.52 (sens 85%, spec 91%). FDG-PET may show frontal hypometabolism; tau\u2010PET (research) shows midbrain uptake. DaTscan demonstrates presynaptic dopaminergic deficit but cannot distinguish PSP from PD or MSA. Quantitative oculography reveals slowed vertical saccades (peak velocity <100\u00b0/s; sens 80%, spec 90%). CSF biomarkers (tau, NfL) are investigational. Rule out vascular and inflammatory mimics with basic labs. Third-tier: tau\u2010PET (flortaucipir) in select centers; genetic testing for MAPT haplotype under research. Pre-test probability in 65\u2010year\u2010old with early falls ~80%; positive midbrain atrophy MRI raises post-test to ~95%. NNT for MRI to confirm PSP ~5.","management_principles":"No disease\u2010modifying therapy exists. Symptomatic management per Movement Disorder Society recommendations: levodopa trial up to 1500 mg/day\u2014response in PSP-P variant (~20\u201330% transient benefit); amantadine 100\u2013300 mg/day may improve gait and alertness (small open\u2010label studies). Botulinum toxin for blepharospasm and dystonia. Non-pharmacologic: physical therapy focusing on balance, assistive devices to prevent falls, speech therapy for dysphagia. Occupational therapy for adaptive equipment. Consider SSRIs for pseudobulbar affect (class II evidence). Experimental: tau immunotherapy (BIIB092) in clinical trials. Levodopa intolerance and autonomic side effects common. In advanced stages, gastrostomy for nutrition and aspiration prevention. Regular bone density monitoring and fall prevention strategies essential. Contraindications: deep\u2010brain stimulation not indicated. Clinical trial enrollment recommended.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up visits every 3\u20136 months to monitor progression, gait safety, swallowing, and cognition. Yearly brain MRI to document midbrain atrophy progression if diagnostic uncertainty persists. Regular assessments of fall frequency and gait testing (Timed Up and Go). Quarterly speech\u2010language evaluations; consider videofluoroscopy for aspiration risk. Monitor medication side effects at each visit. Annual bone density screening given fall risk. Multidisciplinary care involving neurology, PT/OT, SLP, nutrition. Advance care planning early, including discussions on feeding tube and palliative care. Prognostic factors: rapid gait decline and early falls predict shorter survival. Use PSP Rating Scale at baseline and annually to quantify progression (MCID ~5 points).","clinical_pearls":"1. Early falls + vertical gaze palsy = PSP until proven otherwise\u2014sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%. 2. \"Hummingbird\" sign on sagittal MRI is highly suggestive of PSP (midbrain atrophy with preserved pons). 3. Levodopa responsiveness in PSP-P variant may mislead; lack of sustained benefit differentiates from PD. 4. Autonomic failure and cerebellar signs point toward MSA rather than PSP. 5. Tau\u2010PET imaging is emerging but remains research\u2014clinical diagnosis remains paramount.","references":"1. Litvan I, Bhatia KP, Burn DJ, et al.

In Friedreich ataxia\u2014characterized by early-onset gait and limb ataxia, lower-limb weakness with areflexia, diabetes mellitus, and hearing impairment\u2014the most important immediate management step is a comprehensive cardiologic evaluation. Cardiomyopathy (often hypertrophic) is present in up to 90% of patients and is the main determinant of morbidity and mortality (D\u00fcrr et al. 1996; Tsou et al. 2011). Ommen et al. (2020) emphasize that patients with known genetic ataxias should undergo periodic echocardiography and ECG screening to detect myocardial hypertrophy or arrhythmias, even before symptoms arise (Class I, Level B-NR). Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they pertain to inheritance patterns or repeat expansions not characteristic of Friedreich ataxia: B is wrong (FA is autosomal recessive, not dominant); C is wrong (the repeat is GAA, not CAG, which is seen in spinocerebellar ataxias); D is wrong (CTG repeats underlie myotonic dystrophy, not FA).","conceptual_foundation":"Friedreich ataxia (FA) is a hereditary spinocerebellar degenerative disorder classified in ICD-11 as 8A61.0 and in OMIM as #229300. It fits within the broader group of hereditary ataxias, distinguished by AR inheritance, juvenile onset, and multisystem involvement. FA arises from GAA triplet-repeat expansions in intron 1 of the FXN gene on chromosome 9q21 (Campuzano et al. 1996). Normal alleles have \u226433 repeats; disease alleles have 66\u20131,700 repeats. The expansion leads to frataxin deficiency, mitochondrial iron overload, and oxidative stress. Similar expanded\u2013repeat neurogenetic disorders include spinocerebellar ataxias (AD, CAG repeats) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (AD, CTG repeats). Embryologically, frataxin is essential for mitochondrial development in dorsal root ganglia and cardiomyocytes; its deficiency disrupts oxidative phosphorylation systems early in development, leading to progressive neuronal loss in the spinal cord dorsal columns and cerebellar dentate nuclei. Over decades, nosology has evolved from Harding\u2019s original 1981 clinical classification to current molecular definitions based on repeat size and point mutations, enabling genotype\u2013phenotype correlations and carrier screening.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, frataxin localizes to the mitochondrial matrix and facilitates iron\u2013sulfur cluster assembly, critical for electron transport chain complexes I, II, and III. In FA, GAA expansions cause heterochromatin formation and reduced FXN transcription. Frataxin deficiency leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation, free\u2010radical generation, and lipid peroxidation. Neurons in the dorsal root ganglia and spinocerebellar tracts are particularly vulnerable due to high metabolic demand; loss of large myelinated fibers explains the areflexia and sensory ataxia. Cardiomyocytes accumulate iron in mitochondria, causing hypertrophy, fibrosis, and arrhythmias. Pancreatic \u03b2-cells also depend on mitochondrial function, leading to insulin deficiency and DM. The temporal progression starts in childhood with gait instability, followed by limb ataxia, dysarthria, and cardiomyopathy in adolescence. Secondary effects include skeletal deformities (scoliosis) and urinary dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"FA typically presents between ages 5 and 15 with progressive gait ataxia, followed by dysarthria and limb incoordination. Lower\u2010limb areflexia is found in >95% of cases, often with extensor plantar responses. Diabetes mellitus occurs in 10\u201330% (Tsou et al. 2011). Hearing impairment affects ~10\u201315%, predominantly high-frequency loss. Cardiomyopathy\u2014hypertrophic form\u2014is detected in 85\u201390%, often asymptomatic initially but eventually causing exertional dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Other features: pes cavus, scoliosis (~60%), foot deformities, and urinary urgency. Severity correlates with GAA repeat length: longer repeats \u2192 earlier onset and faster progression. Without intervention, wheelchair dependence typically occurs within 10\u201315 years of onset; median lifespan is ~38 years (D\u00fcrr et al. 1996).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis rests on clinical suspicion plus confirmation by FXN gene testing. First\u2010tier: neurological exam, ECG, and echocardiography to assess cardiac involvement (Ommen et al. 2020, Class I, Level B-NR). Nerve conduction studies reveal sensory axonal neuropathy. Second\u2010tier: molecular genetic testing for GAA expansions (PCR and Southern blot) has sensitivity and specificity >99%. MRI may show spinal cord atrophy and cerebellar atrophy. Third\u2010tier: frataxin protein levels by Western blot are reserved for atypical presentations or point mutation carriers. Pretest probability is high in juvenile ataxia with features above; genetic testing has PPV ~100%. Cardiac imaging should be repeated every 12 months in asymptomatic patients and every 6 months if HCM is evolving.","management_principles":"There is no disease\u2010modifying cure; management is supportive. DM is treated per ADA guidelines with insulin and lifestyle measures. Cardiac management follows AHA/ACC HCM guidelines (Ommen et al. 2020): beta\u2010blockers or calcium\u2010channel blockers for symptomatic relief (Class I, Level B-R); ICD implantation in patients with high\u2010risk features (e.g., maximal wall thickness \u226530 mm, family history of sudden death) (Class IIa, Level B-R). Physical therapy and occupational therapy preserve mobility and activities of daily living. Experimental therapies include idebenone, which showed modest cardiac improvement in RCTs (Di Prospero et al. 2007; Reetz et al. 2012).","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurologic follow\u2010up every 6\u201312 months with SARA or FARS scoring to monitor progression. Cardiology: annual ECG and echocardiography in stable patients; biannual imaging if HCM is present or evolving. Endocrinology: quarterly HbA1c and glucose monitoring. Rehabilitation: quarterly PT/OT to adjust orthoses and mobility aids. Scoliosis should be monitored annually by spine imaging. Genetic counseling for patients and at\u2010risk relatives is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1.
