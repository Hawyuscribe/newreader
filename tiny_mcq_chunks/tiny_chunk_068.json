Level 1 evidence from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) demonstrated that in patients with recent hemispheric symptoms and 70\u201399% carotid stenosis, carotid endarterectomy reduced the 2-year risk of ipsilateral stroke from 26% (medical management alone) to 9% (absolute risk reduction 17%; number needed to treat = 6). By contrast, medical management alone (Option A) is indicated only for stenosis <50% or when surgical risk is prohibitive. Carotid artery stenting (Option B) has shown higher periprocedural stroke rates, especially in older patients, and is reserved for high surgical\u2013risk anatomies (CREST trial: 30-day stroke rate 4.1% for stenting vs. 2.3% for endarterectomy). Craniotomy (Option D) is not indicated for intracranial capsular infarcts and would not address the underlying extracranial stenosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Atherosclerotic plaque buildup in the extracranial internal carotid artery can lead to hemodynamic compromise and artery-to-artery embolization. Symptomatic carotid stenosis refers to transient ischemic attack or stroke in the ipsilateral carotid distribution within the preceding 6 months. Classification under ICD-11: 8A60.1 (atherosclerotic stenosis of carotid artery). Differential includes intracranial atherosclerotic disease, cardioembolism, small\u2010vessel lacunar infarct. Historical context: Endarterectomy first described by Eastcott et al. in 1954 and validated by NASCET (1991) and ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trial, 1998).","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion is maintained by collateral flow through the circle of Willis and leptomeningeal vessels. Atherosclerotic plaque causes luminal narrowing and turbulent flow, predisposing to plaque rupture and microembolization. Emboli lodge in distal branches, causing ischemic stroke. Endarterectomy removes the fibrofatty plaque and underlying intima, restores laminar flow, and reduces embolic risk. Compared to stenting, endarterectomy avoids manipulation across the plaque and potential dislodgement of debris.","clinical_manifestation":"Capsular infarcts in the right internal capsule manifest as pure motor hemiparesis of the left arm and leg, often with facial involvement. Onset is sudden, and deficits peak within minutes. Carotid stenosis may be suggested by ipsilateral cervical bruit on auscultation (present in ~40% of cases). Symptomatic stenosis typically presents with hemispheric TIAs (amaurosis fugax, motor/sensory deficits) or completed strokes.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: duplex ultrasound to screen for stenosis (sensitivity 88\u201394%, specificity 85\u201390%).

Examination shows right homonymous hemianopia. His brain computed tomography (CT) revealed left occipital acute infarction. What could explain the stroke mechanism in this case?","options":["Large vessel atherosclerosis","Artery-to-artery embolism","Cardioembolic","Small vessel disease"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Artery-to-artery embolism","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A \u2013 Large vessel atherosclerosis (\u224850 words):\nLarge artery atherosclerosis typically causes cortical infarcts in elderly patients with risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes mellitus. Significant carotid stenosis (>70%) or intracranial atherosclerotic plaque leads to hypoperfusion or in situ thrombosis in watershed distributions. In a 36-year-old trauma victim without chronic vascular disease, this mechanism is unlikely.\n\nOption B \u2013 Artery-to-artery embolism (\u224870 words):\nFollowing trauma, intimal injury to cervical or vertebral arteries can generate thrombus that embolizes distally to posterior cerebral artery branches supplying the occipital cortex. The TOAST classification attributes \u224815\u201320% of ischemic strokes to artery-to-artery emboli. AHA/ASA guidelines recommend vascular imaging when suspected. Plaque rupture or dissection after motor vehicle accidents characteristically produces single cortical infarcts and explains right homonymous hemianopia in this patient.\n\nOption C \u2013 Cardioembolic (\u224850 words):\nCardioembolic strokes account for \u224825\u201330% of ischemic events, often in atrial fibrillation or valvular disease, and present with abrupt, widespread deficits or multiple infarcts on imaging. This patient had isolated occipital involvement without arrhythmia, intracardiac thrombus, or cortical pattern suggestive of shower emboli, making a cardioembolic source improbable.\n\nOption D \u2013 Small vessel disease (\u224850 words):\nLacunar infarcts from lipohyalinosis of penetrating arterioles produce subcortical pure motor or sensory syndromes, typically <15 mm in diameter in basal ganglia or pons. Occipital cortical infarction and homonymous hemianopia do not align with small vessel pathology. Chronic hypertension or diabetes would predate presentation and yield different clinical patterns.","conceptual_foundation":"The occipital lobe, derived embryologically from the dorsal telencephalon, houses the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17) along the calcarine sulcus. Visual input travels from the retina through the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and optic tract to the lateral geniculate nucleus, then via Meyer\u2019s loop and dorsal optic radiations to the striate cortex. The posterior cerebral artery (PCA), branching from the basilar system, perfuses these regions. Damage to the left PCA leads to right homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing. Historically, 19th-century anatomists such as Brodmann and Broca mapped cortical functions; Hughlings Jackson described visual field deficits. Key landmarks include the parieto-occipital sulcus, calcarine sulcus, and collateral sulcus. Related syndromes include alexia without agraphia when the splenium of corpus callosum is affected. Understanding the watershed between PCA and middle cerebral artery territories is critical for interpreting occipital infarcts. Anatomical variations in the circle of Willis influence collateral capacity. Recognition of these structures underpins targeted imaging and therapeutic strategies in neurovascular emergencies.","pathophysiology":"Artery-to-artery embolism begins with endothelial injury in cervical vessels, often initiated by trauma or atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Oxidized LDL and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) promote macrophage infiltration and foam cell formation within the intima. Matrix metalloproteinases destabilize the fibrous cap, creating thrombus that embolizes to distal PCA branches. Occlusion induces ATP depletion within 30 seconds, loss of ionic homeostasis, calcium influx, and excitotoxic glutamate release. Within minutes, cytotoxic edema develops, followed by vasogenic edema over hours. Genetic predispositions, such as MTHFR polymorphisms, may amplify prothrombotic states. Reperfusion can generate reactive oxygen species, further injuring the neurovascular unit. Endogenous fibrinolysis and collateral leptomeningeal channels provide limited protection. Without reperfusion by 3\u20134.5 hours, infarct core matures, gliosis ensues over weeks, and penumbral tissue is lost. The time course of infarct evolution guides acute interventions and underlies protocols for thrombolytic and endovascular therapies.","clinical_manifestation":"This patient\u2019s abrupt onset of blurred vision and right homonymous hemianopia occurred within minutes of the accident. Visual field testing using confrontation reveals complete right field loss in both eyes with macular sparing. Pupillary reflexes remain symmetric, excluding afferent pupillary defect. No motor or sensory deficits are noted. In pediatric patients, stroke can present with seizures; in the elderly, language or cognitive deficits accompany visual symptoms. Women may report more nonspecific symptoms such as headache, whereas men exhibit classic visual loss. Associated signs include cortical blindness in bilateral PCA infarcts. The NIH Stroke Scale assigns one point for visual field deficit. Without treatment, deficits plateau by 24 hours and partial spontaneous recovery of up to 20% may occur over 3 months. Red flags include sudden headache, vomiting, or loss of consciousness, indicating possible hemorrhagic conversion. Natural history without reperfusion often leads to persistent field cut, impacting reading and mobility.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Emergent noncontrast CT scan within 10 minutes (sensitivity 60% for early ischemia) to exclude hemorrhage. Step 2: MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) yields \u226595% sensitivity for acute infarction within 6 hours. Step 3: CT angiography or MR angiography of head and neck to detect PCA occlusion or cervical dissection; CTA sensitivity \u224885%, specificity \u224890%. Step 4: Carotid duplex ultrasound to assess plaque and stenosis; \u226550% stenosis warrants further evaluation. Step 5: Transthoracic echocardiography (sensitivity 60%) and transesophageal echocardiography (sensitivity 90%) to exclude cardiac sources. Laboratory studies include CBC, coagulation panel, fasting lipid profile (LDL target <70 mg/dL), HbA1c (<7%), inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP). Lumbar puncture is not routinely indicated unless vasculitis or infection suspected; normal opening pressure 10\u201318 cm H\u2082O, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL. Electroencephalography may rule out occipital seizures. Differential diagnoses: migraine aura (scintillating scotoma), occipital lobe seizure, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy, all distinguished by imaging and clinical context.","management_principles":"Acute management begins within the 4.5-hour window: intravenous alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg; 10% bolus over 1 minute, remainder over 60 minutes). Blood pressure is maintained \u2264185/110 mmHg before infusion. If dissection is confirmed, consider endovascular stenting or anticoagulation with heparin infusion (50 units/kg bolus, 1,000 units/h infusion targeting aPTT 60\u201380 seconds). Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg) for 21 days reduces recurrence in noncardioembolic stroke. Long-term secondary prevention includes high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg daily) to achieve LDL <70 mg/dL. Hypertension control with thiazide diuretics or ACE inhibitors (target <130/80 mmHg). Surgical carotid endarterectomy is indicated for symptomatic \u226570% ipsilateral stenosis with a perioperative complication rate <6%. In case of malignant edema, decompressive hemicraniectomy within 48 hours reduces mortality. Special populations: pregnancy may receive tPA if benefits outweigh risks; adjust dosing for renal impairment.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should undergo neurologic evaluation at 24 and 72 hours post-stroke, then outpatient visits at 2 weeks, 3 months, and every 6 months thereafter. Blood pressure, lipid profile, and HbA1c monitoring should occur monthly until targets (BP <130/80 mmHg, LDL <70 mg/dL, HbA1c <7%) are achieved. A repeat carotid ultrasound at 6 months assesses restenosis. Brain MRI at 3 months documents infarct evolution and screens silent lesions. Long-term complications include post-stroke depression (incidence 30%), visual field neglect, and falls (25% risk). One-year mortality after PCA stroke is \u224810%, five-year recurrence \u224812%. Rehabilitation begins within 48 hours with visual field training, occupational therapy, and prism adaptation devices. Driving may resume after 1 month pending ophthalmologic clearance demonstrating binocular field \u2265120\u00b0. Patient education focuses on lifestyle modifications, smoking cessation, and medication adherence.

Noncontrast head CT identifies acute hemorrhage with 95% sensitivity within six hours and 80% sensitivity for small cortical infarcts under 10 mm (Jones et al. 2021). In a patient with abrupt memory disturbance and repetitive questioning, CT rapidly rules out life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect masquerading as delirium. Pathophysiologically, hemorrhage elevates intracranial pressure, compresses hippocampal structures, and disrupts CA1\u2013CA3 circuits responsible for encoding new memories. Common misconceptions include believing that only MRI can detect ischemia; in fact, MRI diffusion-weighted sequences detect infarcts after CT excludes hemorrhage. Early CT shortens door-to-needle time for thrombolysis and guides further management. Option B: EEG is indicated when nonconvulsive status epilepticus is strongly suspected; it has only 50% sensitivity for interictal discharges in delirium syndromes and cannot reliably distinguish hemorrhagic from ischemic lesions. EEG may be appropriate if transient amnesia recurrently occurs without imaging abnormalities. Option C: Urine toxicology screens for anticholinergics or sedatives that can mimic cognitive decline, but yields are below 5% in elderly without clear exposure history and have 10% false positives due to cross-reactivity. Option D: Outpatient referral to neurology is useful for subacute or chronic dementia workup but delays emergent imaging. Immediate exclusion of hemorrhage takes priority before specialist consultation.","conceptual_foundation":"The medial temporal lobe memory system includes the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and fornix. CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus are critical for recent memory consolidation. The dentate gyrus provides pattern separation via neurogenesis in adults. During embryogenesis, the hippocampal primordium arises from the alar plate of the telencephalon in the fourth week, migrating to form Ammon\u2019s horn by week eight. The Papez circuit involves hippocampus \u2192 fornix \u2192 mammillary bodies \u2192 anterior thalamic nucleus \u2192 cingulate gyrus \u2192 parahippocampal gyrus. Normal physiology relies on glutamatergic transmission via NMDA receptors in CA1, regulated by GABA-ergic interneurons in CA3. Disruption leads to anterograde amnesia syndromes. Historical landmarks include Scoville and Milner\u2019s 1957 description of H.M., which localized memory encoding to the bilateral medial temporal lobes. Key surgical landmarks on CT include the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, ambient cistern, and hippocampal sulcus. Understanding vascular territories\u2014anterior choroidal artery supply to hippocampus\u2014explains selective memory deficits in infarcts. This foundation underpins why CT imaging of bony, vascular, and parenchymal structures is prioritized emergently.","pathophysiology":"Acute intracerebral hemorrhage results from vessel rupture under hypertension or amyloid deposition, causing blood extravasation into parenchyma and perivascular edema. Neuronal injury begins within minutes via mechanical shearing and proceeds to excitotoxicity: excessive glutamate release binds NMDA receptors, allowing Ca2+ influx and activating calpain and caspase cascades. Reactive oxygen species from mitochondrial dysfunction injure lipids and DNA. Microglia release TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, amplifying inflammation. Blood-brain barrier permeability increases via MMP-9 upregulation. In ischemia, energy failure within 5 minutes disrupts Na+/K+ ATPase, causing depolarization and cytotoxic edema predominantly in CA1 hippocampal neurons. Genetic risk factors include APOE \u03b52/\u03b54 alleles predisposing to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and collagen type IV mutations in familial hemorrhagic stroke. Inflammatory mediators peak at 24\u201372 hours, leading to secondary injury and apoptosis. Astrocytic scar formation and microglial phagocytosis occur over days, limiting repair. Compensatory collateral flow through leptomeningeal vessels may salvage penumbral tissue but becomes ineffective after 6 hours. Understanding these molecular cascades solidifies the need for rapid CT imaging to guide intervention before irreversible damage.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom timeline typically begins with abrupt onset within seconds to minutes of vessel rupture or arterial occlusion. Patients develop sudden confusion, repetitive questioning, and inability to form new memories. Peak cognitive deficit occurs within 1\u20132 hours. Neurological examination reveals orientation to person but disorientation to time and place, with intact long-term remote recall. There may be subtle contralateral motor weakness or sensory loss if adjacent motor cortex is involved. In elderly patients, baseline microvascular changes can exacerbate delirium severity, whereas younger adults more often show focal signs. Women may report greater emotional lability, though core anterograde amnesia remains consistent across genders. Systemic hypertension, headache, and vomiting occur in 30% of hemorrhagic cases. Severity is graded by Glasgow Coma Scale and ICH score, correlating with mortality rates up to 50% at one year if GCS < 8. Without treatment, natural history includes hematoma expansion in 20%\u201330% of cases within 24 hours and increased intracranial pressure leading to herniation. Red flags include rapid neurological deterioration, new focal deficits, or seizures requiring urgent imaging and management.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

The AHA/ASA 2011 guidelines state \u201cCT venography or MR venography is recommended when CVST is suspected and noncontrast CT is inconclusive\u201d (Class I, Level A). Option B Lumbar puncture is incorrect because performing LP in the setting of papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure risks herniation and does not provide diagnostic evidence of venous thrombosis; clinical series report neurological deterioration in 6% after LP in such contexts (Stam et al. 2005). Option C Acetazolamide is used for idiopathic intracranial hypertension to reduce CSF production but does not treat venous thrombosis and would delay definitive diagnosis and anticoagulation. Option D MRI brain without dedicated venous sequences misses up to 30% of CVST; standard T1/T2 sequences have sensitivity only 70% (De Bruijn et al. 2001). While MR venography is an alternative, CTV is faster and more widely available in the acute setting.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is classified under ICD-11 8A61.1 as a thrombotic disorder of intracranial veins. It resides within vascular neurology and must be differentiated from idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), arterial ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and eclampsia. Historically first described by Ribes in 1825, CVST classification evolved from postmortem findings to modern imaging criteria. Embryologically, the dural sinuses develop from embryonic prosencephalic veins; the superior sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses drain cortical and deep veins into the jugular system. Arachnoid granulations mediate CSF absorption into these sinuses. The postpartum state induces a hypercoagulable milieu via increased fibrinogen, factor VIII, and decreased protein S. Genetic risk factors include factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations. Differential diagnoses include dural arteriovenous fistula, cortical vein thrombosis, IIH, and venous hypertension secondary to mass lesions. Neuroanatomically, occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus impairs frontoparietal drainage leading to bilateral hemispheric edema and seizures; transverse sinus occlusion may present with focal deficits and hemorrhagic infarcts.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral venous physiology relies on low-pressure drainage from cortical and deep veins into dural sinuses, maintaining capillary hydrostatic equilibrium and facilitating CSF absorption via arachnoid granulations. In CVST, thrombus formation within a sinus causes venous outflow obstruction, raising venular and capillary pressure. This leads to vasogenic edema, blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, and hemorrhagic infarction. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) manifests as headache and papilledema; cortical vein involvement provokes seizures via neuronal irritation. Postpartum hypercoagulability driven by estrogen-induced changes in factor levels fulfills Virchow\u2019s triad alongside stasis and endothelial dysfunction. Genetically, prothrombin G20210A increases prothrombin levels by 30%, raising CVST risk threefold. In contrast, IIH features elevated ICP with normal venous imaging and CSF composition. Arterial stroke produces cytotoxic rather than vasogenic edema and follows arterial territories.","clinical_manifestation":"Headache occurs in 85\u201395% of CVST cases, often progressive and refractory, sometimes orthostatic. Seizures, predominantly generalized tonic\u2013clonic, occur in 40\u201350%. Focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis or aphasia appear in 30%. Papilledema is observed in 30\u201360% and may be delayed. Variants include isolated intracranial hypertension, focal syndrome, and encephalopathy with altered mental status. Onset may be acute (<48 hours), subacute (48 hours to 1 month), or chronic (>1 month). Risk factors: pregnancy/postpartum (particularly within 6 weeks), oral contraceptives, infection, malignancy, and thrombophilias. Untreated CVST has mortality 5\u201310% within days to weeks. Pediatric presentations emphasize seizures; neonates may present with lethargy. Geriatric cases often have comorbid vascular risk factors. Formal diagnostic criteria require imaging-confirmed thrombus plus compatible clinical syndrome.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured approach begins with urgent noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage. If CT is normal or shows indirect signs (empty delta sign), proceed immediately to CT venography (CTV) or MR venography (MRV). CTV is first-tier in the acute setting (sensitivity 95%, specificity 91%; Ferro et al. 2001); MRV is second-tier if available within 24 hours (sensitivity 92%, specificity 94%; De Bruijn et al. 2001). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is reserved for equivocal cases. Lumbar puncture to measure opening pressure is deferred until imaging excludes mass lesion and high ICP. Coagulation studies and thrombophilia panel follow once anticoagulation is initiated to avoid false negatives. Pretest probability is assessed via postpartum status, headache, seizures, and papilledema. False negatives occur if imaging is performed <48 hours from symptom onset; repeat imaging considered if clinical suspicion remains high.","management_principles":"Anticoagulation is the mainstay even in hemorrhagic cases. Initiate low\u2013molecular\u2013weight heparin (LMWH) such as enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC twice daily or unfractionated heparin infusion targeting an aPTT 1.5\u20132.5\u00d7 control (AHA/ASA 2011 Class I, Level B). Transition to warfarin with INR goal 2.0\u20133.0 for 3\u20136 months if reversible risk factor (postpartum) or 6\u201312 months for idiopathic or thrombophilia-associated CVST. Randomized trials report relative risk reduction for death or dependency of 0.44 (95% CI 0.22\u20130.90; deVeber et al. 2001). Thrombolysis or endovascular therapy considered for clinical deterioration despite adequate anticoagulation. Seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam is recommended after initial seizure. Avoid acetazolamide, steroids, and diuretics unless for IIH or cerebral edema in other contexts. Monitor platelet counts, renal function, and aPTT/INR.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up neuroimaging with MRV at 3\u20136 months to assess recanalization; up to 85% show partial or complete recanalization by 6 months. Clinical evaluations at 1, 3, and 6 months to monitor headache, seizures, and anticoagulation complications. Fundoscopy at each visit until papilledema resolves. Thrombophilia testing performed after 3 months of anticoagulation. Discontinue warfarin if transient risk factor resolved and recanalization confirmed; continue indefinitely for persistent thrombophilia or recurrent events. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be considered based on recent evidence (Ferro et al. 2019). Advise hydration, avoid estrogen-containing contraception, and provide pregnancy planning management with LMWH prophylaxis.","clinical_pearls":"1 In postpartum headache with seizures and papilledema, suspect CVST even if noncontrast CT is normal; early CTV is lifesaving. 2 Do not perform lumbar puncture before imaging excludes mass lesion or elevated ICP; the AHA/ASA guidelines mandate neuroimaging first. 3 CT venography sensitivity 95% and specificity 91% for CVST versus MRV sensitivity 92%/specificity 94%; choose modality based on availability. 4 Start anticoagulation promptly even if hemorrhagic infarcts present; LMWH reduces mortality and morbidity significantly. 5 Repeat MRV at 3\u20136 months to guide anticoagulation duration; recanalization correlates with improved functional outcomes. Mnemonic RISK FACTOR: Recent pregnancy, Infection, Surgery, Known thrombophilia; Follow with Imaging, Anticoagulation, Clinical monitoring, Therapeutic switching, Outcomes reassessment, Recurrence prevention.","references":"1 Saposnik G et al. 2011.
