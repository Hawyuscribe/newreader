Randomized trials (e.g., E05 study) demonstrate ~30\u201350% seizure reduction at 1 year with VNS (p<0.01). No other options were provided.","conceptual_foundation":"Surgical candidacy in epilepsy depends on localization of seizure onset. Multifocal EEG findings suggest non-resectable epilepsy (ILAE classification: drug-resistant epilepsy type 3). Neuromodulation options include VNS, responsive neurostimulation, and deep brain stimulation.","pathophysiology":"VNS modulates brain excitability by delivering intermittent electrical pulses to the left vagus nerve, activating brainstem nuclei (locus coeruleus, nucleus tractus solitarius), increasing inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA), and desynchronizing cortical networks.","clinical_manifestation":"Candidates typically have drug-resistant seizures with variable semiology, bilateral independent discharges, and non-localizable MRI. Seizure types may include focal impaired awareness and generalized tonic\u2013clonic events.","diagnostic_approach":"Presurgical evaluation includes prolonged video EEG, high-resolution MRI, PET/SPECT, and neuropsychological testing. Multifocal spikes on EEG with no concordant imaging focus excludes resective surgery candidacy and indicates neuromodulation.","management_principles":"VNS implantation guidelines (AAN 2017) recommend VNS for drug-resistant epilepsy when resection is not an option (level B). Initial settings: 0.25 mA, 30 Hz, 500 \u03bcs pulse width, 30 s on/5 min off, titrated to efficacy and tolerability.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postimplant follow-up at 2 weeks for wound check and device interrogation, then every 3\u20136 months for parameter adjustment. Seizure diaries and quality of life scales (QOLIE-31) monitored annually.","clinical_pearls":"1. Multifocal EEG discharges contraindicate resective surgery. 2. VNS reduces seizure frequency by \u226550% in ~50% of patients. 3. Side effects: hoarseness, cough; tend to improve over time. 4. VNS efficacy increases over the first 2 years. 5.

What will you do?","options":["Increase Carbamazepine dose","Refer to surgery"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Refer to surgery","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Refer to surgery is correct because mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) patients whose seizures remain refractory after trials of two appropriately chosen and tolerated antiepileptic drugs (topiramate and carbamazepine) meet the criteria for drug-resistant epilepsy and should undergo surgical evaluation. Increasing carbamazepine beyond recommended dosages carries risks of dose-related toxicity and is unlikely to achieve seizure freedom in established MTS, according to ILAE and AAN practice parameters.","conceptual_foundation":"MTS is characterized by hippocampal neuronal loss and gliosis that create an epileptogenic circuit in the mesial temporal lobe. In epilepsy classification systems (ICD-11, ILAE), drug-resistant focal epilepsy is defined by failure of two adequate AED trials. Surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone, typically an anterior temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalohippocampectomy, is the gold standard for MTS refractory to medical therapy.","pathophysiology":"Normally, hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons regulate excitatory-inhibitory balance. In MTS, neuron loss in these regions leads to mossy fiber sprouting and formation of aberrant recurrent excitatory circuits, lowering the seizure threshold and facilitating seizure generation in the temporal lobe.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with MTS typically present with focal impaired awareness seizures, characterized by epigastric rising sensation, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, olfactory hallucinations, and automatisms such as lip-smacking or hand fumbling. Seizures often generalize secondarily.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial workup includes 3 Tesla MRI demonstrating hippocampal atrophy and signal changes, and interictal EEG showing unilateral temporal spikes or sharp waves. For refractory cases, long-term video EEG monitoring, neuropsychological testing, and functional imaging (FDG-PET, SPECT) are indicated to delineate the epileptogenic zone before surgery.","management_principles":"First-line AEDs for focal epilepsy include carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam. When two AEDs fail, referral to an epilepsy surgery center for multimodal presurgical evaluation is recommended. Surgical resection in MTS yields seizure freedom (Engel Class I) in approximately 60\u201370% of patients.","follow_up_guidelines":"After surgery, patients require scheduled follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months with seizure diary review, MRI to exclude complications, and neuropsychological testing. AED tapering may commence after one year of seizure freedom under specialist guidance.","clinical_pearls":"1. Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined after two failed appropriate AED trials. 2. Hippocampal sclerosis is the most common pathology in adult refractory TLE. 3. Anterior temporal lobectomy yields seizure freedom in up to 70% of MTS. 4. Early surgical referral improves neurocognitive outcomes. 5. Neuropsychological deficits often lateralize the epileptogenic focus.","references":"1. Wiebe S, Blume WT, Girvin JP, Eliasziw M.

Ictal automatisms in temporal lobe epilepsy are typically contralateral to the epileptogenic focus. Left temporal discharges most commonly produce automatisms in the right hand and face via propagation through thalamocortical and basal ganglia circuits.","conceptual_foundation":"Focal impaired awareness seizures originating in the temporal lobe are classified under focal epilepsy in ICD-11. Lateralizing signs such as ictal manual automatisms, dystonic posturing, and head version help localize the seizure onset zone.","pathophysiology":"Seizure activity in the temporal neocortex and mesial structures propagates to motor areas, eliciting automatisms. Contralateral execution of automatisms occurs due to decussation of motor pathways and network connectivity patterns.","clinical_manifestation":"Temporal lobe seizures often start with an aura followed by impaired awareness and automatisms such as lip-smacking, chewing, or manual manipulation. Lateralizing signs are subtle and rely on detailed clinical observation.","diagnostic_approach":"Video EEG monitoring correlates ictal semiology with EEG discharge lateralization. Lateralizing signs refine the placement of intracranial electrodes when noninvasive data are inconclusive.","management_principles":"Therapeutic approach remains AED optimization followed by presurgical evaluation if seizures remain refractory. Semiological lateralizing features guide invasive monitoring strategies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Continuous monitoring of seizure semiology over multiple events helps confirm lateralization. Adjustments to treatment and surgical candidacy are based on multimodal correlations.","clinical_pearls":"1. Ictal automatisms are contralateral to the focus in >80% of temporal lobe seizures. 2. Manual automatisms localize to the non-dominant hemisphere. 3. Postictal aphasia indicates dominant hemisphere involvement. 4. Ictal head version is a reliable lateralizing sign. 5.
