This patient\u2019s right hand flexion, left hand extension, and left head deviation fit this classic pattern, localizing the focus to the right SMA. Orbitofrontal cortex seizures often feature emotional changes, olfactory hallucinations, or dysautonomia, not this tonic posturing. Frontopolar cortex seizures may cause complex behavioral automatisms but lack the characteristic asymmetric tonic limb posture. Cingulate gyrus seizures typically produce emotional and autonomic phenomena rather than the fencing posture.","conceptual_foundation":"The SMA lies on the medial frontal lobe anterior to the primary motor cortex and is involved in planning and initiation of voluntary movement. Its gyral anatomy is defined in the paracentral lobule. Seizures from this area can spread rapidly to the primary motor cortex and contralateral homologous SMA via the corpus callosum, generating bilateral motor phenomena. ICD-11 classifies focal seizures with tonic activity under 8A60.23. Historical lesion studies and intracranial EEG recordings established the SMA fencing posture in the 1950s.","pathophysiology":"Ictal discharges in the SMA hyperexcite pyramidal neurons that project to the spinal cord and to contralateral SMA via callosal fibers. Asymmetric activation yields extension of the contralateral arm and flexion of the ipsilateral arm. Spread to adjacent motor areas influences head and eye deviation. GABAergic interneuron dysfunction in SMA circuits contributes to seizure initiation and propagation.","clinical_manifestation":"SMA seizures are typically brief (<60 seconds), may lack impairment of consciousness, and present with asymmetric tonic posturing. Head deviation is ipsilateral to the extended arm. There may be postictal flaccidity of the affected limbs. Frequency varies from infrequent to multiple daily events.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Scalp EEG may show diffuse frontal slow waves but often fails to localize. Video EEG correlating semiology with ictal patterns is essential. Second-tier: MRI with high-resolution epilepsy protocol often reveals focal cortical dysplasia in the SMA. Third-tier: Ictal SPECT or PET can detect hyperperfusion or hypometabolism in the SMA. SEEG may be required for definitive localization before surgery.","management_principles":"First-line ASMs include carbamazepine or levetiracetam. In refractory cases, surgical resection of the epileptogenic SMA focus yields seizure freedom in up to 70% of selected patients. Minimally invasive options such as laser interstitial thermal therapy can target the SMA. Neurostimulation is an alternative if surgery is contraindicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor seizure frequency, perform video EEG if semiology changes, and repeat MRI yearly if lesion progression is a concern. Postoperative patients require monitoring for SMA syndrome and compensatory motor rehabilitation. ASM tapering may be considered after 2 years of seizure freedom.","clinical_pearls":"1. Fencing posture lateralizes to the contralateral SMA. 2. Brief asymmetric tonic posturing with preserved awareness suggests SMA origin. 3. Scalp EEG often underlocalizes; use video EEG and PET. 4.

Referral for epilepsy surgery. Evidence-based guidelines from the American Epilepsy Society (2018) and the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) strongly recommend epilepsy surgery for patients with medically refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis. Randomized controlled trials (Wiebe et al., 2001; Spencer et al., 2017) demonstrated that anteromesial temporal resection achieved seizure freedom in 60\u201370% of patients at one year versus 8% for continued medical therapy (hazard ratio 8.7, 95% CI 3.2\u201323.4). Level A evidence supports early surgical referral after failure of two adequate anti-seizure medications. Option A is incorrect because psychiatric referral alone will not control epileptic seizures and may delay definitive treatment. Option C is incorrect: while valproate is broad-spectrum, it is not first-line for MTLE and carries risks in women of childbearing age; also she has failed at least two prior medications. Option D (VNS) is reserved for patients not candidates for resective surgery or who decline it, with lower rates of seizure freedom (8\u201310%).","conceptual_foundation":"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is characterized by hippocampal sclerosis on MRI (ICD-11 8A60.0). Historical nosology evolved from \u201ctemporal lobe epilepsy\u201d to a distinct entity when MRI and pathology confirmed neuronal loss and gliosis in the hippocampus. Differential includes neocortical temporal epilepsy, frontal lobe epilepsy, and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Embryologically, the hippocampus arises from the medial pallium; disruptions in neuronal migration can predispose to sclerosis. Neuroanatomically, the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and their reciprocal connections constitute the epileptogenic network. Glutamatergic excitatory circuits predominate, with GABAergic interneuron loss in CA1\u2013CA3 regions. Vascular supply is from anterior choroidal and posterior cerebral arteries. Genetic factors (SCN1A, LGI1) may confer susceptibility to hippocampal sclerosis.","pathophysiology":"Normal hippocampal physiology involves tightly regulated excitatory-inhibitory balance controlling memory and emotional processing. In MTLE, initial precipitating insults (febrile seizures, head trauma) induce mossy fiber sprouting and aberrant excitatory recurrent circuits. Loss of inhibitory interneurons leads to hyperexcitability. Calcium-dependent signaling cascades, NMDA receptor overactivation, and inflammation (IL-1\u03b2 upregulation) contribute to sclerosis. Chronically, the hippocampus undergoes gliosis, neuronal dropout, and synaptic reorganization, lowering seizure threshold. The amygdala\u2019s involvement explains aura of fear. Compared to neocortical epilepsy (diffuse cortical dysplasia), MTLE shows focal pathology confined to mesial structures.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in adolescence or adulthood with an aura of rising epigastric sensation, fear, or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (70% of cases), followed by impaired awareness seizures and secondary generalization. Seizure frequency ranges from monthly to yearly; drug-resistant MTLE is defined as failure of two antiseizure drugs. Prodromal mood changes or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu may occur days before. In untreated long-term, cognitive decline, memory impairment and depression are common. ILAE diagnostic criteria require MRI evidence of hippocampal sclerosis plus concordant EEG findings. Sensitivity of high-resolution MRI for hippocampal sclerosis exceeds 90%, specificity ~95%.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: high-resolution epilepsy protocol MRI (1.5\u20133T) focusing on coronal T2 and FLAIR to identify mesial temporal sclerosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 94%). Video-EEG monitoring captures seizures to lateralize focus (ictal onset in mesial temporal leads). Second-tier: PET shows hypometabolism in epileptogenic temporal lobe (sensitivity 70%). SPECT ictal-interictal subtraction yields localization accuracy ~80%. Third-tier: intracranial EEG (depth electrodes) if noninvasive studies discordant. Pre-surgical neuropsychological testing documents baseline memory and language. Functional MRI for language lateralization is often performed. Genetic testing is not routinely indicated.","management_principles":"First-line medical therapy includes lamotrigine or levetiracetam for MTLE, but in drug-resistant cases (failed \u22652 appropriate AEDs), AAN guidelines (2018) give Class I recommendation for referral to epilepsy surgery centers. Anterolateral temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalohippocampectomy yields long-term seizure freedom in 60\u201370% (Level A). VNS is second-tier palliative therapy for those not surgical candidates (Class IIb). Ketogenic diet may be considered in refractory cases. Preoperative counseling must address memory and language risks. Post-operative AED tapering may begin after 1\u20132 years seizure-free.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-surgical follow-up includes outpatient visits at 3, 6, 12 months, then yearly. MRI at 6\u201312 months to assess resection cavity. Neuropsychological re-evaluation at 12 months to quantify cognitive changes. Seizure diary monitoring is critical. AED tapering protocol: reduce dosage by 10\u201325% every 3\u20136 months after 2 years seizure-free, with close clinical and EEG monitoring. Monitor for depression, memory decline, and quality of life improvements. Long-term prognosis: seizure freedom in 50% at 10 years.","clinical_pearls":"1. In MTLE, auditory or visceral auras (fear, stomach rising) signal mesial temporal focus\u201490% concordance with MRI hippocampal sclerosis. 2. Failure of two adequate AED trials constitutes drug resistance\u2014refer early to surgery. 3. Anteromesial temporal resection offers best chance of seizure freedom (60\u201370% at 1 year). 4. VNS provides modest seizure reduction (~50% responders at 2 years) but rarely seizure freedom. 5.

Option A, focal motor seizure with impaired awareness, is incorrect because there were no clonic or tonic movements. Option C, generalized absence seizure, is incorrect because absence seizures are brief (seconds), have typical 3 Hz spike-wave discharges on EEG, and present in childhood. Option D, focal motor seizure with intact awareness, is incorrect because awareness was clearly impaired during the episodes.","conceptual_foundation":"Focal seizures arise from a discrete region of cortex and are classified by onset (focal vs generalized) and awareness (ILAE 2017). The term non-motor refers to seizures lacking overt motor signs, manifesting instead with autonomic, cognitive, emotional, or sensory symptoms. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, cortical irritation from blood breakdown products precipitates seizures in 20\u201330% of patients, often within the first week. ICD-11 classifies symptomatic epileptic seizures under 8A60. Differential diagnoses include transient ischemic attacks, syncope, and metabolic encephalopathy.","pathophysiology":"Extravasated blood in the subarachnoid space triggers an inflammatory response, with hemoglobin degradation releasing iron and heme, which generate reactive oxygen species and disrupt the blood-brain barrier. Albumin extravasation into cortex induces astrocytic activation and gliosis, lowering seizure threshold. Hyperexcitable neuronal networks in the irritative zone generate synchronized discharges seen as rhythmic activity on EEG, producing impaired awareness and behavioral arrest.","clinical_manifestation":"These focal non-motor seizures present as episodes of blank stare, behavioral arrest, and unresponsiveness lasting up to several minutes. Automatisms\u2014such as lip smacking or hand movements\u2014may occur. Postictal confusion is common. In aneurysmal SAH patients, early seizures occur in 20% within the first 72 hours, often associated with cortical blood deposition and peri-cortical edema.","diagnostic_approach":"EEG is the diagnostic modality of choice. Interictal spikes, rhythmic theta/delta slowing, or ictal patterns localized to one hemisphere support focal onset. Continuous video EEG monitoring increases yield, correlating clinical events with electrographic changes. MRI with gradient echo or susceptibility-weighted imaging may demonstrate cortical hemosiderin. CT is reserved for acute hemorrhage detection.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for acute symptomatic seizures post-SAH is levetiracetam (initial loading 20 mg/kg IV, then 500\u20131500 mg twice daily) due to favorable side effect profile. Phenytoin (15\u201320 mg/kg loading, maintenance 4\u20137 mg/kg/day) is an alternative. Prophylactic AEDs beyond 7 days are not routinely recommended unless recurrent seizures occur.

Clinical Triad of MELAS:\n   - Mitochondrial Encephalopathy: manifests as stroke-like episodes that cause focal neurological deficits (visual field defects, seizures).\n   - Lactic Acidosis: due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation leading to elevated lactate in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.\n   - Stroke-like episodes: often involve the occipital and parietal lobes, producing cortical blindness or hemianopia, migrainous headaches, and focal seizures.\n\n2. Pathophysiology:\n   - MELAS is most commonly caused by point mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), particularly the A3243G mutation in the tRNA^Leu(UUR) gene (MTTL1).\n   - Heteroplasmy and threshold effect explain variable age of onset and severity. Neurons, highly dependent on aerobic metabolism, suffer energy failure, leading to cytotoxic and vasogenic edema that do not conform to vascular territories.\n   - Impaired electron transport chain activity leads to lactic acid accumulation and an elevated lactate peak on MR spectroscopy.\n\n3. Imaging Features:\n   - MRI: T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in cortical and subcortical regions, often migratory and not restricted to a single vascular distribution.\n   - Diffusion-weighted imaging may show mixed cytotoxic and vasogenic edema.\n   - MR spectroscopy: lactate doublet peak at 1.3 ppm in affected regions.\n\n4. Laboratory Findings:\n   - Elevated serum and CSF lactate and pyruvate levels.\n   - Muscle biopsy (if performed) reveals ragged-red fibers on Gomori trichrome and cytochrome c oxidase\u2013negative fibers.\n   - Genetic testing confirms mtDNA mutations.\n\nWhy other options are wrong:\n\nA. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD):\n   - CJD is a prion disease presenting with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and periodic sharp wave complexes on EEG.\n   - It does not cause focal stroke-like episodes, elevated serum lactate, or migratory cortical lesions on MRI.\n\nC. Panayiotopoulos (Occipital Lobe) Epilepsy:\n   - A benign childhood epilepsy syndrome, typically presenting in children aged 3\u20136 years with autonomic seizures (e.g., vomiting, pallor), occasional visual hallucinations, and occipital spikes on EEG.\n   - It is self-limited, without progressive cognitive decline, lactic acidosis, or persistent MRI abnormalities.\n\nD. MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged-Red Fibers):\n   - Also a mitochondrial disorder, but characterized predominantly by myoclonus, generalized seizures, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and hearing loss.\n   - Stroke-like episodes and occipital lobe\u2013predominant lesions are not typical of MERRF; lactate may be elevated but clinical picture centers on myoclonus and muscle involvement.\n\nKey Concepts and Pathophysiology:\n\n- Mitochondria generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in mtDNA compromise electron transport, leading to reduced ATP, increased reactive oxygen species, and lactic acidosis.\n- Neurons and muscle cells are most susceptible due to high energy demands.\n- Heteroplasmy: cells contain both normal and mutant mtDNA; symptom threshold reached when mutant load exceeds a critical level.\n\nClinical Pearls:\n\n- Stroke-like episodes in MELAS often do not respect vascular territories and can migrate over time.\n- Elevated lactate in serum/CSF and a lactate peak on MRS are strong clues to mitochondrial pathology.\n- Arginate or citrulline supplementation may ameliorate stroke-like episodes by supporting nitric oxide production and cerebral blood flow.\n- Always consider maternal inheritance pattern in family history, though de novo mutations occur.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
