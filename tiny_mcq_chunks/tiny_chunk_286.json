[{"question_number":"11","question":"A Parkinson's patient on medication developed wearing off phenomena; what is the mechanism?","options":["Failure of medication","Disease progression","Medication intolerance"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Disease progression","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B is correct because wearing\u2010off phenomena in Parkinson\u2019s disease arise primarily from the progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, leading to reduced endogenous dopamine buffering capacity and fluctuations in plasma levodopa levels (Olanow et al. Neurology 2004;62(1):125\u2013132). Option A is incorrect: failure of medication implies nonadherence or malabsorption rather than predictable end\u2010of\u2010dose reemergence. Option C is incorrect: medication intolerance refers to side\u2010effects limiting dose escalation, not motor fluctuations.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease is classified under neurodegenerative movement disorders (ICD-11: 8A00). It involves alpha\u2010synucleinopathy leading to loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Motor fluctuations such as wearing\u2010off occur after 5\u201310 years of levodopa therapy as the disease progresses and buffering capacity wanes.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: dopaminergic neurons store and release dopamine steadily. In PD, progressive neuron loss leads to reliance on exogenous levodopa with short half\u2010life (~90 minutes). Over time, synaptic storage fails; peaks and troughs in dopamine levels produce wearing\u2010off (Obeso et al. Mov Disord 2000;15 Suppl 1:2\u201312).","clinical_manifestation":"Wearing\u2010off presents as predictable reemergence of bradykinesia, rigidity, or tremor at end\u2010of\u2010dose intervals. Early PD patients have smooth response; after years, 40\u201350% develop wearing\u2010off within 5 years (Ahlskog JE, Muenter MD. Brain 2001;124(Pt 8):1591\u20131608).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on patient diaries documenting timing of symptom return in relation to levodopa dosing. Tools: Wearing\u2010Off Questionnaire (WOQ\u20109) with sensitivity 89% and specificity 71% (Standaert DG et al. Mov Disord 2006;21(9):1459\u20131463).","management_principles":"First\u2010line: fractionate levodopa dosing; use extended\u2010release formulations. Adjunctive therapies: COMT inhibitors (entacapone reduces off\u2010time by ~1.5 hours/day, Level A evidence AAN 2018), MAO-B inhibitors (rasagiline), dopamine agonists.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor motor fluctuations every 3\u20136 months; adjust therapy based on WOQ scores. Assess for dyskinesias from peak\u2010dose and on\u2013off phenomena. AAN guideline recommends COMT inhibitors for wearing\u2010off (Class I evidence).","clinical_pearls":"1. Wearing\u2010off reflects disease progression, not drug failure. 2. Fractionating levodopa dosing can temporarily improve off\u2010time. 3. COMT inhibitors add ~1.5 hours of on\u2010time. 4. WOQ\u20109 is a quick screening tool. 5. Early adjunctive therapy may delay motor complications.","references":"1. Olanow CW, et al.

Patient confidentiality is a fundamental principle of medical ethics. According to the AAN Code of Ethics (2015), a physician must respect a patient\u2019s autonomy and confidentiality unless there is a clear, legally mandated exception such as an imminent risk of harm to others. Genetic information, including Huntington\u2019s disease diagnosis, is protected under HIPAA and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA, 2008). Disclosing to an employer without the patient\u2019s consent would violate these regulations. No other options were provided for analysis.","conceptual_foundation":"This question focuses on medical ethics. Key concepts include patient autonomy, confidentiality, informed consent, and duty to warn. Confidentiality is codified in the Hippocratic Oath and reinforced by modern legal frameworks such as HIPAA and GINA. In the context of genetic disorders, nondisclosure of genetic information is essential unless the patient explicitly requests or consents to sharing, or there is a clear and imminent risk to identifiable third parties that is legally reportable (e.g., imminent violence).","pathophysiology":"While pathophysiology is not directly applicable to this ethics question, Huntington\u2019s disease involves CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene leading to neuronal apoptosis, primarily in the striatum and cortex, manifesting as chorea, psychiatric changes, and cognitive decline. The progressive nature may impact work capacity over time, but until functional impairment presents a direct workplace hazard, confidentiality stands.","clinical_manifestation":"Not directly relevant to ethical disclosure. Huntington\u2019s disease typically presents in mid-adulthood with chorea, executive dysfunction, and psychiatric symptoms such as depression or irritability. Occupational impairment usually occurs in late stages when physical and cognitive decline interfere with job performance.","diagnostic_approach":"Not directly relevant. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing showing \u226536 CAG repeats in the HTT gene. Pre-test genetic counseling is required to discuss implications for the patient and family members.","management_principles":"Management is symptomatic: tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine for chorea, SSRIs or antipsychotics for psychiatric symptoms, and multidisciplinary supportive care including physical, occupational, and speech therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up every 6\u201312 months is recommended, with monitoring of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric progression. Assessment of occupational capacity should be revisited if decline is noted.","clinical_pearls":"1. Genetic information is confidential; do not disclose without patient consent. 2. GINA protects patients from genetic discrimination by employers. 3. Always document patient preferences regarding disclosure. 4. Consult an ethics committee if uncertain about duty to warn. 5.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["PKAN","Wilson's disease","Huntington's disease","Dystonia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"PKAN","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: PKAN. Pantothenate kinase\u2013associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is characterized by the pathognomonic \u201ceye of the tiger\u201d sign on T2-weighted MRI\u2014central hyperintensity within the globus pallidus surrounded by a rim of hypointensity\u2014due to iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation (Hayflick et al., 2003). Option B, Wilson\u2019s disease, can show basal ganglia changes on MRI but lacks this distinctive pattern and presents with low ceruloplasmin and Kayser-Fleischer rings. Option C, Huntington\u2019s disease, manifests with caudate atrophy and chorea, not isolated dystonia with central pallidal hyperintensity. Option D, dystonia, describes a clinical syndrome rather than a specific diagnosis and would not explain the MRI findings.","conceptual_foundation":"PKAN is one of the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) disorders, caused by autosomal recessive mutations in PANK2 on chromosome 20p13. It accounts for ~50% of NBIA cases (Kruer et al., 2012). Onset is typically in childhood (classic PKAN before age 10) with progressive dystonia, parkinsonism, and retinal degeneration (ICD-11: 8A01.2). Differential diagnoses include Wilson\u2019s disease (E83.0), mitochondrial disorders (e.g., Leigh syndrome), and other NBIAs (e.g., PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration). Historically, NBIA disorders were grouped by clinical presentation; genetic advances have refined this taxonomy over the last two decades.","pathophysiology":"Pantothenate kinase 2 catalyzes the first step in coenzyme A biosynthesis. Loss-of-function mutations in PANK2 lead to accumulation of cysteine-containing substrates, chelation of iron, and oxidative stress within the globus pallidus. Iron-mediated Fenton chemistry generates hydroxyl radicals, causing lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal death (Zhou et al., 2001). The central hyperintense core on T2 MRI corresponds to gliosis and vacuolation, while the peripheral hypointense rim reflects iron deposition.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic PKAN presents before age 10 with progressive dystonia\u2014often oromandibular and limb\u2014in approximately 80% of cases, parkinsonism in ~60%, and spasticity in ~50% (Gregory et al., 2008). Visual impairment from pigmentary retinopathy occurs in 40%. Disease progression leads to dysarthria, dysphagia, scoliosis, and contractures over 10\u201315 years. A \u201clate-onset\u201d variant (>10 years) has milder, more slowly progressive features.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI brain is first-line: T2-weighted sequences reveal the eye-of-the-tiger sign (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~100%) (Hayflick et al., 2003). Genetic testing confirms biallelic PANK2 mutations. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels exclude Wilson\u2019s disease. Other tests (e.g., iron studies, mitochondrial panels) are guided by differential considerations. No biopsy is required once imaging and genetics agree.","management_principles":"There is no approved disease-modifying therapy. Symptomatic treatments include anticholinergics (trihexyphenidyl), baclofen, and intramuscular botulinum toxin for focal dystonia (Level C evidence). GPi deep brain stimulation yields ~30\u201360% improvement in dystonia scores in uncontrolled series (Hogarth et al., 2015). Iron chelation with deferiprone is investigational, with limited open-label data suggesting modest MRI iron reduction and clinical stabilization.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurologic assessments every 6\u201312 months monitor motor function, speech, swallowing, and orthopedic complications. MRI may be repeated every 1\u20132 years if clinically indicated. Multidisciplinary care\u2014including physical, occupational, and speech therapy\u2014optimizes function. Genetic counseling is recommended for family planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. The \u2018eye of the tiger\u2019 sign on T2 MRI is pathognomonic for PKAN. 2. PKAN results from autosomal recessive PANK2 mutations causing CoA biosynthesis failure. 3. Early-onset (<10 years) cases progress rapidly over 10\u201315 years. 4. GPi deep brain stimulation can significantly improve refractory dystonia. 5. Distinguish PKAN from Wilson\u2019s disease by normal ceruloplasmin and absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings.","references":"1. Hayflick SJ, et al. PKAN: clinical spectrum and MRI.
