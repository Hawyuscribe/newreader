[{"question_number":"2","question":"A patient with facial weakness and seizures presents with what other condition?","options":["Sturge-Weber disease","Mitochondrial myopathy","Arnold-Chiari malformation","Neurofibromatosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Sturge-Weber disease","subspecialty":"Pediatric Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Sturge-Weber disease. Sturge-Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by a facial port-wine stain (nevus flammeus) in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, leptomeningeal angiomas leading to seizures, and contralateral hemiparesis or facial weakness. Multiple case series (Comi et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2018) report that 75\u201390% of patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome develop seizures, and up to 60% develop hemiparesis. None of the other options combine both seizures and facial weakness in a congenital vascular malformation context. Option B (mitochondrial myopathy) presents with lactic acidosis, exercise intolerance, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), but not isolated facial weakness. Option C (Arnold-Chiari malformation) leads to headaches, cerebellar signs, and syringomyelia, not seizures or facial paresis. Option D (neurofibromatosis) presents with neurocutaneous tumors and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots; seizures occur rarely, and facial weakness is due to nerve sheath tumors, not a leptomeningeal angioma process.","conceptual_foundation":"Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is classified under neurocutaneous syndromes in ICD-11 (QD71.0) and presents in early childhood. It is distinct from other phakomatoses like NF1/NF2 and tuberous sclerosis. The key features include: a) facial capillary malformation (port-wine stain) along V1/V2 distribution; b) leptomeningeal angiomas involving the parietal and occipital lobes; and c) ocular involvement (glaucoma). Embryologically, this arises from a somatic GNAQ mutation during vascular development. Neuroanatomically, pial vessels proliferate abnormally, leading to chronic venous ischemia of underlying cortex with calcifications (\u2018tram-track\u2019 on CT). Venous drainage deficits of superficial cortical veins lead to gliosis and atrophy. Differential diagnoses include Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome, Cobb syndrome, and other vascular malformations. Historical nosology evolved from early 20th-century descriptions by Sturge and Weber to modern molecular classification after identification of the GNAQ gene mutation.","pathophysiology":"Normal leptomeningeal vessels regulate cerebral blood flow via autoregulation; in Sturge-Weber, ectatic vessels lack smooth muscle and are prone to shunting, leading to cortical hypoperfusion. Chronic hypoxia triggers cortical calcification (Type I pattern) and gliosis. Seizures arise from cortical irritation and neuronal loss. GNAQ mutation induces constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway in endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis. Inflammatory mediators (VEGF, IL-6) further disrupt the blood-brain barrier. Over time, compensatory collateralization is insufficient, leading to episodic focal ischemia manifesting as transient hemiparesis or facial weakness. Unlike mitochondrial myopathies (mitochondrial respiratory chain defects) or Chiari malformations (hindbrain herniation), SWS\u2019s pathophysiology is purely vascular and somatic mosaic in origin.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in infancy with a port-wine stain involving V1/V2 dermatome. Seizures begin in the first year of life in 75\u201390% of cases; they are often focal and refractory. Hemiparesis or facial weakness appears contralateral to leptomeningeal angiomas in 40\u201360% of patients. Glaucoma develops in 30\u201370% by adolescence. Cognitive impairment occurs in 30\u201350%. Atypical presentations include isolated ocular disease or late-onset seizures. Natural history without treatment includes progressive neurological decline, refractory epilepsy, and stroke-like episodes. Diagnostic criteria per AAP (2019) require two of three key features: port-wine stain, leptomeningeal angioma on imaging, and early-onset seizures.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Contrast-enhanced MRI with susceptibility-weighted imaging to reveal leptomeningeal angiomas and pial enhancement (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95%). Non-contrast CT shows gyriform calcifications (\u2018tram-track\u2019, sensitivity 70%, specificity 85%). Ophthalmologic exam for glaucoma. Second-tier: EEG to localize seizure focus (often occipital, 60% of cases). Genetic testing for GNAQ somatic mosaicism from affected skin (biopsy) has PPV 95%. Third-tier: PET perfusion studies to assess hypometabolism and guide surgical planning. Pretest probability is high in any infant with V1 port-wine stain and seizures (>80%); post-test probability after MRI is >98%.","management_principles":"Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) form first-line therapy; vigabatrin and levetiracetam show 50\u201360% seizure reduction. Class I evidence (AAN 2017) supports early aggressive seizure control to prevent developmental delay. Laser therapy (pulsed-dye laser) for port-wine stain reduces cutaneous morbidity. Topical beta-blockers (timolol) may also be used. Glaucoma management follows AAO guidelines: timolol eye drops, surgical trabeculectomy if needed. Hemispheric functional hemispherectomy is second-tier for refractory epilepsy (Class B evidence) with seizure freedom rates up to 70%. Experimental third-tier approaches include mTOR inhibitors (everolimus) targeting angiogenesis pathways.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurology visits every 3\u20136 months for seizure monitoring and AED adjustment. Annual MRI to monitor leptomeningeal disease progression. Ophthalmology checks every 6 months for glaucoma. Developmental assessments every 6 months using standardized scales (Bayley, WPPSI). Monitor for AED side effects with periodic liver function tests and complete blood counts every 3\u20136 months. Eye pressure measurement at each ophthalmology visit. Transition to adult care by age 18 with multidisciplinary team.","clinical_pearls":["Port-wine stain in V1 distribution + seizures = Sturge-Weber until proven otherwise.","\u2018Tram-track\u2019 gyriform calcifications on CT are pathognomonic of SWS.","GNAQ somatic mosaic mutation underlies abnormal angiogenesis in SWS.","Early seizure control (<1 year of age) correlates with better cognitive outcomes.","Functional hemispherectomy offers seizure freedom in refractory cases (up to 70%)."],"references":["1.

Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders characterized by progressive cognitive decline, vision loss, and myoclonic seizures in childhood. MRI often shows cortical (grey matter) atrophy or signal changes. Histopathology demonstrates accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigments (lipofuscin) in neurons. \n\nOption A (Gaucher disease) features glucocerebroside accumulation in macrophages (Gaucher cells), hepatosplenomegaly, and variable neurologic involvement in type 2 and 3.

It is inborn error of lysosomal degradation of subunit C of mitochondrial ATP synthase, leading to intraneuronal accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment. Differential includes other lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher, Tay\u2013Sachs). Embryologically, neurons in cortical grey matter accumulate storage material.","pathophysiology":"Normal lysosomal function degrades intracellular debris. In NCL, mutations (e.g., CLN2 gene encoding tripeptidyl peptidase 1) impair proteolytic processing. This leads to progressive neuronal dysfunction and death via accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin, oxidative stress, and microglial activation. The cortical grey matter is selectively vulnerable, explaining MRI findings and neurologic signs.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical NCL presents in late childhood with progressive vision loss (optic atrophy, loss of visual evoked potentials), cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and stimulus-sensitive myoclonic seizures.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Adrenoleukodystrophy","Friedreich's ataxia","Ataxia-telangiectasia","Spinocerebellar ataxia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Adrenoleukodystrophy","subspecialty":"Pediatric Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is the correct choice. ALD is an X-linked recessive peroxisomal disorder characterized by accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in the central nervous system, adrenal cortex, and testes, leading to progressive ataxia, spasticity, and adrenal insufficiency in affected males. Approximately 35\u201340% of childhood cerebral ALD patients present initially with cerebellar ataxia and gait disturbances by age 7\u201310 years. Female carriers rarely manifest full disease (\u223c2\u20135% symptomatic) but can show late-onset spastic paraparesis. Option B: Friedreich\u2019s ataxia is autosomal recessive, caused by GAA triplet expansion in FXN on chromosome 9; presents in adolescence with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus (10\u201320%), and kyphoscoliosis, not X-linked (incorrect). In some cohorts up to 25% of FRDA cases initially mimic sensory ataxia, but family history and inheritance pattern differ. Option C: Ataxia-telangiectasia is autosomal recessive ATM mutation, with oculocutaneous telangiectasias by age 3\u20135, immunodeficiency, and high AFP (>90% cases), not X-linked. Some adult-onset variants present subtly, but key signs distinguish it. Option D: Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) encompass >40 subtypes, typically adult onset (mean age 30\u201350) with family history in direct vertical transmission, not X-linked; SCA3 is most common in some populations (30\u201340%). A common misconception is to conflate any hereditary ataxia with AD SCAs; however, inheritance and extra-CNS findings clarify the diagnosis. Large registry data show that less than 1% of X-linked pedigrees are due to SCAs, whereas ALD accounts for up to 45% of X-linked neurometabolic ataxias.","conceptual_foundation":"The cerebellum comprises three functional zones: the vestibulocerebellum (flocculonodular lobe) for balance; the spinocerebellum (vermis and intermediate hemispheres) for axial and limb coordination; and the cerebrocerebellum (lateral hemispheres) for planning and initiation of movement. Purkinje cells receive input via climbing fibers from inferior olivary nuclei and mossy fibers from pontine nuclei; they send inhibitory GABAergic output to deep cerebellar nuclei (fastigial, interposed, dentate). Embryologically, the rhombic lip (rhombomere 1) gives rise to granule neurons, while ventricular zone progenitors generate Purkinje cells. Normal physiology depends on precisely timed excitatory\u2013inhibitory oscillations governing motor learning via long-term depression at parallel fiber synapses. The hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis also interacts with cerebellar function through glucocorticoid receptors in Purkinje cells. Related syndromes include Kilquist syndrome (ATP1A3-related ataxia), episodic ataxia types 1\u20132 (KCNA1, CACNA1A), and ARSACS (SACS mutation). Historically, neurometabolic ataxias were first described in the 1920s, but peroxisomal involvement in ALD was elucidated in the 1970s by Moser et al., leading to identification of the ABCD1 gene in 1993. Key landmarks: superior cerebellar peduncle decussation, deep cerebellar nuclei topography, and dentatorubral tract mapping, all critical for lesion localization on imaging and intraoperative navigation.","pathophysiology":"X-linked ALD arises from mutations in the ABCD1 gene on Xq28 encoding the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP), an ATP-binding cassette transporter critical for peroxisomal uptake of saturated VLCFAs (\u2265C22:0). Loss of ALDP disrupts peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation leading to accumulation of C24:0 and C26:0 in plasma and tissues. At the cellular level, VLCFA deposition in microglia and oligodendrocytes triggers oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation. Activated microglia release proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and complement components promoting demyelination. The progressive breakdown of myelin sheaths within the parieto-occipital white matter, corpus callosum, and corticospinal tracts typically occurs over 6\u201324 months. Secondary excitotoxicity via glutamate release further injures neurons. There is compensatory upregulation of peroxisomal proliferation receptors (PPAR\u03b1) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase), but these mechanisms cannot fully counteract VLCFA toxicity. ADLD, the adult form of ALD, demonstrates slower onset with spastic paraplegia and minimal cerebral involvement, highlighting spectrum variability. Female carriers exhibit lyonization mosaicism, explaining milder phenotypes in \u223c15% by middle age.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of childhood cerebral ALD usually occurs between 5 and 12 years, with an insidious prodrome of attention deficit (80%) and behavioral changes over 3\u20136 months. Motor signs appear next: truncal ataxia, limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia in 90% within the first year. Dysarthria and hyperreflexia with Babinski signs develop by month 9\u201312. Adrenal insufficiency manifests concurrently in 70% as salt-wasting crises, hyperpigmentation, and fatigue. Ophthalmoplegia and hearing loss may appear later. In adult ALD, dysesthesias, spastic paraparesis, and mild ataxia predominate, with slower progression over 5\u201315 years. Neurological exam in childhood ALD reveals dysdiadochokinesia, dysmetria, nystagmus, intention tremor, and ataxic gait requiring assistance by 18\u201324 months post-onset. Friedreich\u2019s ataxia shows absent deep tendon reflexes (50%), extensor plantar responses (40%), and pes cavus. Ataxia-telangiectasia demonstrates choreoathetosis and immunodeficiency. SCAs present with oculomotor apraxia in SCA2 or dystonia in SCA3. Untreated childhood ALD leads to loss of ambulation by 24 months post-onset and death by 3\u20135 years without intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

Schwannomas are extramedullary nerve-sheath tumors that appear along dorsal nerve roots rather than within the cord parenchyma. Metastases are extremely rare in a 4-year-old without a known primary malignancy and typically present with multiple lesions and variable enhancement.","conceptual_foundation":"Pediatric intramedullary spinal cord tumors: astrocytomas (60\u201370%), ependymomas (20\u201330%), and other rare glial neoplasms. WHO classification divides astrocytomas into low-grade (grade I\u2013II) and high-grade (grade III\u2013IV) based on histologic features. Intramedullary tumors originate within the spinal cord parenchyma, displacing surrounding white matter tracts. Differential diagnoses include inflammatory myelopathies, vascular malformations, and cystic lesions. Embryologically, astrocytomas arise from glial progenitor cells derived from neuroectoderm. Neuroanatomically, lesions in the cervical cord present with upper-limb dysfunction; thoracolumbar lesions produce lower-limb spasticity, sphincter disturbances, and sensory level.","pathophysiology":"Normal astrocytes regulate extracellular ion balance and form the blood\u2013brain barrier via tight junctions. In astrocytomas, somatic mutations such as BRAF-KIAA1549 fusions in pilocytic astrocytoma or NF1 loss lead to Ras/MAPK pathway activation, driving neoplastic proliferation. Low-grade tumors maintain relatively preserved blood\u2013brain barrier resulting in absent or minimal gadolinium enhancement. Progressive mass effect disrupts ascending and descending tracts, causing motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction. Over time, tumoral growth leads to local hypoxia, reactive gliosis, and vascular proliferation in higher-grade lesions, which then demonstrate enhancement.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms evolve insidiously over weeks to months. Common presentations include progressive gait disturbance (75%), back pain (60%), motor weakness (65%), and sensory deficits (50%). Sphincter dysfunction (urinary retention or incontinence) may be an early sign in lower cord lesions. Low-grade astrocytomas have a median symptom duration of 6\u201312 months before diagnosis, whereas high-grade lesions progress more rapidly (median 3\u20136 months). Atypical presentations include acute deterioration due to intratumoral hemorrhage (rare in low-grade).","diagnostic_approach":"MRI spine with and without contrast is the gold standard (AAN guideline 2014, Level B). Low-grade astrocytomas: T1-hypo to isointense, T2-hyperintense, minimal enhancement, cord expansion. Ependymomas: central location, mixed signal, cap sign (hemosiderin rim), robust enhancement. CT myelography is reserved for MRI-incompatible patients. Preoperative CSF analysis has low yield for tumor cells (<5% sensitivity) and is not routinely recommended. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathology via biopsy or surgical resection.","management_principles":"Surgical resection is first-line; gross total resection (GTR) correlates with improved progression-free survival (5-year PFS ~70% after GTR vs. ~30% after subtotal resection; McGirt MJ et al. Neurosurgery. 2009;64(6):1046\u20131055). Adjuvant radiotherapy is considered for residual low-grade tumors at doses of 45\u201350.4 Gy (AAPM TG-101). Chemotherapy (carboplatin plus vincristine) is used for progressive unresectable disease, especially in children <3 years to delay radiotherapy (Packer RJ et al. J Clin Oncol. 2006;24(12):229\u2013234). High-grade astrocytomas may require focal radiotherapy plus temozolomide per pediatric oncology protocols.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI at 48\u201372 hours to assess extent of resection. Serial MRI every 3 months for first year, then every 6 months until 5 years, and annually thereafter if stable (Children\u2019s Oncology Group guidelines 2020). Neurological examination at each imaging visit. Monitor for late effects: spinal deformity, radiation myelopathy, endocrine dysfunction.","clinical_pearls":"1. Pediatric intramedullary tumors are predominantly astrocytomas\u2014non-enhancing on MRI suggests low-grade. 2. Extent of resection is the strongest prognostic factor\u2014aim for gross total resection when safe. 3. Low-grade astrocytomas often harbor BRAF alterations\u2014molecular testing can guide targeted therapies. 4. Adjuvant radiotherapy is reserved for residual or progressive disease in children >3 years. 5. Lifelong follow-up with MRI is essential due to late recurrences.","references":"1.

Tuberous sclerosis. Subependymal nodules (cortical and subependymal hamartomas) on neuroimaging, in the setting of seizures and developmental delay in a young child, are classic for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Neurofibromatosis type 1 (B) features caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, optic gliomas, Lisch nodules, and neurofibromas rather than subependymal nodules. Sturge-Weber syndrome (C) is characterized by leptomeningeal angiomatosis, pial enhancement, cortical calcifications (\u201ctram-track\u201d), and a port-wine stain, not subependymal nodules. Von Hippel-Lindau disease (D) involves hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum and retina, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma, without subependymal nodules. Therefore, TSC is the only condition among the options that presents with characteristic subependymal nodules in a pediatric patient with seizures and developmental delay.","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome resulting from mutations in either TSC1 (hamartin) or TSC2 (tuberin) genes. It is classified under phakomatoses (ICD-11 code: 8A01) and is distinguished by hamartomatous proliferations affecting the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, eyes, and lungs. Differential diagnoses include other neurocutaneous disorders such as neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and von Hippel-Lindau disease. TSC lesions derive from disrupted mTOR signaling due to loss of hamartin/tuberin complex function, leading to abnormal cell growth and matrix production. Embryologically, neural progenitor cells in the ventricular zone give rise to cortical tubers and subependymal nodules along the lateral ventricles. The lesions are often seen near the caudothalamic groove. TSC\u2019s nosological evolution spans from Bournville\u2019s 19th-century description to modern genetic and molecular characterization of mTOR pathway dysregulation. Clinically, TSC lesions align with aberrant cell\u2013cell signaling, involving overactive PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascades. The blood supply to these hamartomas arises from perforating branches of the lateral striate arteries. Molecularly, TSC1/TSC2 mutations impair the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rheb, causing constitutive mTORC1 activation. Phenotypic heterogeneity reflects second-hit somatic mutations in affected tissues.","pathophysiology":"Normal mTORC1 signaling regulates cell growth, protein synthesis, and autophagy in response to nutrient and growth factor cues. In TSC, germline mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 disrupt the hamartin\u2013tuberin complex, which normally acts as a GAP for Rheb, preventing Rheb-GTP accumulation and excessive mTORC1 activation. This leads to unchecked phosphorylation of S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, promoting protein synthesis and cell proliferation. At the cellular level, cortical tubers consist of dysmorphic neurons and giant cells; subependymal nodules are glial hamartomas along the ventricular lining that can calcify. Chronically, these lesions cause cortical dysplasia and epileptogenesis via altered excitatory/inhibitory balance\u2014giant cells release excitatory neurotransmitters and disrupt normal lamination. The mTOR pathway also influences angiogenesis and extracellular matrix deposition, contributing to the hamartomatous growth. Unlike the vascular malformations of Sturge-Weber (leptomeningeal angiomas) or the Schwann cell dysplasia of NF1 (neurofibromas), TSC hamartomas arise from glioneuronal progenitors. Seizure activity correlates with focal cortical irritability from cortical tubers and perituberal cortex.","clinical_manifestation":"TSC often presents in infancy or early childhood. Seizures occur in up to 80\u201390% of patients, frequently as infantile spasms (West syndrome) in 30\u201350%. Developmental delay and autism spectrum disorders occur in 40\u201360%. The diagnostic triad\u2014adenoma sebaceum (facial angiofibromas), seizures, and intellectual disability\u2014appears variably. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) develop in 5\u201315% during childhood, often at the foramen of Monro, causing hydrocephalus. Renal angiomyolipomas occur in 50\u201380% by adulthood. Cardiac rhabdomyomas are detected prenatally or in neonates in 50\u201375%, frequently regressing over time. Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis affects women of childbearing age. Skin findings include hypomelanotic macules (90%), shagreen patches (50%), and periungual fibromas (50%). The TSC diagnostic criteria (2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference) require \u22652 major features or 1 major plus \u22652 minor features; sensitivity ~94%, specificity ~100%.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes brain MRI (sensitivity ~95% for cortical tubers, ~90% for subependymal nodules), ideally at 1.5\u2009T or higher, to detect cortical dysplasia, nodules, and SEGAs. Renal ultrasound (sensitivity ~85%) screens for angiomyolipomas and cysts. Echocardiography (sensitivity ~90%) identifies rhabdomyomas. Dermatologic examination under Wood\u2019s lamp (sensitivity ~75%) detects hypomelanotic macules. Genetic testing for TSC1/TSC2 mutations has ~75\u201390% detection rate and confirms the diagnosis when imaging criteria are equivocal. Second-tier tests include pulmonary function tests and high-resolution CT for LAM in adult females. Ophthalmologic exam for retinal hamartomas and dental exam for enamel pits are adjunctive. Differential imaging features\u2014calcified cortical tubers vs. tram-track calcifications in Sturge-Weber\u2014aid in differentiation.","management_principles":"mTOR inhibitors (everolimus, sirolimus) are first-line for growing SEGAs (Class I, Level B evidence from EXIST-1 trial: 35% SEGA volume reduction vs. 0 in placebo, p<0.0001) and for renal angiomyolipomas (EXIST-2: 55% response vs. 7% placebo, p<0.0001). Antiepileptic drugs (vigabatrin for infantile spasms; level B evidence) reduce spasms in 80%. Cortical resection or laser interstitial thermal therapy for refractory epilepsy (seizure reduction >50% in 60\u201370% of cases) is considered when focal. Cardiac rhabdomyomas usually regress; intervention is rarely needed unless obstructive. Dermatologic lesions respond to topical sirolimus. Behavioral therapies and special education support autism and cognitive deficits.
