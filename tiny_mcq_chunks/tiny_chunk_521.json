[{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient with Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) presents with intractable vomiting. Which area of the brain is likely involved?","options":["Area postrema","Cerebellum","Thalamus","Medulla oblongata"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Area postrema","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Area postrema. In neuromyelitis optica (NMO), pathogenic aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies target astrocytic foot-processes in periventricular regions, prominently affecting the area postrema, which lacks a blood-brain barrier and is rich in AQP4 expression. Involvement of the area postrema leads to intractable hiccups, nausea, and vomiting (Wingerchuk et al. 2015, Neurology 84(11):1165\u20131173). Option B (Cerebellum) is incorrect because cerebellar involvement manifests primarily with limb ataxia, dysmetria, and truncal instability rather than isolated vomiting. Option C (Thalamus) typically produces sensory disturbances, pain syndromes, or altered consciousness, not isolated vomiting. Option D (Medulla oblongata) as a general location may involve autonomic or respiratory centers, but the specific vomiting center is in the area postrema at the floor of the fourth ventricle. Thus, only the area postrema directly explains intractable vomiting in NMO.","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromyelitis optica is classified under CNS inflammatory demyelinating disorders in the ICD-11 (8A00). It is distinct from multiple sclerosis based on seropositivity for AQP4-IgG and characteristic brainstem and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis lesions. The area postrema, located in the dorsal medulla at the caudal floor of the fourth ventricle, is one of the circumventricular organs that lack an intact blood-brain barrier, making it susceptible to circulating autoantibodies. Embryologically, circumventricular organs arise from specialized ependymal cells; area postrema develops from the roof plate of the hindbrain. Neuroanatomically, the area postrema receives visceral afferent input from the nucleus tractus solitarius and projects to the dorsal vagal nucleus, coordinating the vomiting reflex. AQP4 channels are highly expressed on astrocytes in this region, rendering it a prime target in NMO pathogenesis.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the area postrema monitors blood-borne toxins and initiates the vomiting reflex via efferent projections to central pattern generators. In NMO, AQP4-IgG binding leads to complement-mediated astrocyte injury, loss of AQP4 expression, and secondary inflammation. Microglial activation and cytokine release (IL-6, IL-17) amplify tissue damage. Disruption of astrocytic water homeostasis and blood-brain barrier integrity results in vasogenic edema in periventricular regions, particularly area postrema. This lesion produces hyperactivity of the emetic circuitry, causing persistent vomiting. Other options, such as cerebellar or thalamic involvement, lack this direct activation of the emesis center and display different molecular cascades (e.g., Purkinje cell loss in cerebellum, thalamic relay dysfunction).","clinical_manifestation":"In NMO, area postrema syndrome presents as intractable nausea, hiccups, and vomiting lasting days to weeks prior to myelitis or optic neuritis. It occurs in up to 15\u201330% of AQP4-IgG-positive patients as an initial symptom (Wingerchuk et al. 2015). Symptoms are unresponsive to standard antiemetics. Other brainstem syndromes in NMO include oculomotor disturbances and respiratory failure if adjacent nuclei are affected. Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and optic neuritis follow in weeks to months. Diagnostic criteria require \u22651 core clinical characteristic (including area postrema syndrome) with AQP4-IgG seropositivity and supportive MRI findings.","diagnostic_approach":"Workup begins with MRI of the brain with dedicated brainstem sequences; T2-FLAIR hyperintensity in the dorsal medulla adjacent to the fourth ventricle is characteristic. Spinal MRI to exclude short segment lesions of MS, and AQP4-IgG serology (cell-based assay, sensitivity ~75%, specificity ~99%) are first-tier. CSF analysis reveals neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and absence of oligoclonal bands in two-thirds of cases. Second-tier testing includes MOG-IgG serology to exclude MOG-associated disease. Nerve conduction studies are not indicated. Area postrema lesions demonstrate incomplete blood-brain barrier breakdown without gadolinium enhancement in early phases, evolving over days.","management_principles":"Acute management of area postrema syndrome in NMO involves high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 5 days) followed by an oral prednisone taper. If refractory, plasma exchange (5\u20137 exchanges over 10\u201314 days) is recommended (Wingerchuk et al. 2015). Long-term immunosuppression with rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d7 4, then every 6 months), eculizumab (1200 mg q2 weeks), or satralizumab reduces relapse risk by ~70\u201380% (Pittock et al. 2019, NEJM 381(7):614\u2013625). Azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil are alternatives. Avoid MS therapies such as interferon-beta which can exacerbate NMO.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require clinical follow-up every 3\u20136 months with MRI brain/spine annually or after relapse. Monitor B-cell counts if on rituximab; maintain CD19 counts <1%. Periodic AQP4-IgG titers correlate poorly with relapse risk but may guide treatment. Monitor for steroid toxicity, immunosuppression-related infections, and vaccination status (avoid live vaccines on immunosuppression). Assess functional scales like EDSS biannually.","clinical_pearls":"1. Intractable vomiting or hiccups refractory to GI workup in NMO should prompt AQP4-IgG testing\u2014high yield for early diagnosis. 2. Area postrema lacks blood-brain barrier, explaining focal NMO lesions here. 3. AQP4-IgG serology has specificity ~99%, false positives rare. 4. MS disease-modifying therapies can worsen NMO\u2014avoid interferon-beta. 5. Plasma exchange is critical for steroid-refractory NMO attacks\u2014initiated within 7 days of symptom onset improves outcomes.","references":"1. Wingerchuk DM, Banwell B, Bennett JL, et al.

What is the DMT?","options":["Dimethyl fumarate","Natalizumab","Interferon beta","Glatiramer acetate"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Dimethyl fumarate","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF, also known as BG-12) is an oral disease-modifying therapy approved for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) that was originally developed for psoriasis. In pivotal phase III trials (DEFINE and CONFIRM), DMF reduced annualized relapse rates by 53% compared with placebo (Gold et al. Lancet 2012;380(9836):236-43; Fox et al. N Engl J Med 2012;367(12):1098-107). DMF activates the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, leading to anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects in both skin and central nervous system. By contrast, natalizumab (option B) is a monoclonal antibody against \u03b14-integrin without known benefit in psoriasis and carries risk of PML. Interferon \u03b2 (option C) may exacerbate or precipitate psoriasis in up to 10%\u201315% of treated patients (AAN guideline on MS 2018). Glatiramer acetate (option D) has no known efficacy in psoriasis and lacks the fumarate-mediated anti-psoriatic mechanism. Thus, only dimethyl fumarate among the listed DMTs improves psoriasis while treating RRMS.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system classified under ICD-11 code 8A40. RRMS is characterized by discrete clinical attacks followed by periods of remission. Psoriasis is a T helper 17 (Th17)\u2013driven chronic inflammatory skin disease, ICD-11 code 4A80, sharing key cytokine pathways (IL-17, TNF-\u03b1). Fumaric acid esters, including DMF, were first introduced in Germany (Fumaderm) for psoriasis based on their ability to shift immune response from a Th1/Th17 profile to an anti-inflammatory Th2 profile via Nrf2 activation and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) inhibition. Nosologically, psoriasis and MS both involve aberrant T-cell activation and cytokine release. Embryologically, skin and CNS arise from ectoderm, with shared lineage factors such as SOX transcription factors. Neuroanatomically, DMF\u2019s modulation of microglia and astrocyte oxidative stress pathways preserves myelin integrity in periventricular white matter, corpus callosum, and spinal cord tracts targeted in RRMS.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, fumarate metabolites engage the Keap1\u2013Nrf2 complex, releasing Nrf2 to induce antioxidant response elements (ARE) and upregulate detoxifying enzymes (e.g., heme oxygenase-1). In psoriasis, keratinocyte proliferation and T-cell infiltration generate reactive oxygen species (ROS); Nrf2 activation by DMF reduces ROS and downregulates IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 production. In MS, DMF crosses the blood-brain barrier and similarly activates Nrf2 in microglia and oligodendrocytes, attenuating oxidative injury, inhibiting NF-\u03baB, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6). Cellularly, DMF induces a shift toward regulatory T cells (Tregs) and reduces memory B-cell survival. Chronically, these effects limit demyelination, promote remyelination, and decrease lesion formation on MRI. In contrast, interferon \u03b2 signals via STATs to reduce antigen presentation but can upregulate psoriasis-driving cytokines in skin, explaining its relative contraindication in psoriatic patients.","clinical_manifestation":"RRMS presents with relapses of optic neuritis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, sensory disturbances, and motor weakness. Psoriasis manifests as erythematous plaques with silver scale on extensor surfaces. In DMF-treated RRMS patients with concomitant psoriasis, one observes parallel improvement in neurologic relapse rates (ARR reduction ~50% over 2 years) and psoriasis severity (PASI score reduction ~75% at 24 weeks) (Mrowietz et al. J Dtsch Dermatol Ges 2017;15(12):1259-71). Typical DMF side effects include flushing (40%\u201350%), transient GI symptoms (30%\u201340%), and lymphopenia (5% grade 3/4). Monitoring of lymphocyte counts every 3 months detects decreases <0.8\u00d710^9/L requiring dose adjustment. In special populations, such as pregnancy, DMF is category C but limited data suggest no major teratogenic signal.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of RRMS follows the 2017 McDonald criteria requiring dissemination in time and space on MRI or clinical attacks. First-tier workup includes brain and spinal cord MRI with and without gadolinium (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%), cerebrospinal fluid (oligoclonal bands, 85% sensitivity), and screening labs (CBC, LFTs, renal function). Pre-treatment screening for DMF includes baseline lymphocyte count, LFTs, and varicella zoster virus serology. The NNT to prevent one relapse over 2 years with DMF is ~4. In resource-limited settings, clinical criteria supplemented by visual evoked potentials (sensitivity 80%) may guide diagnosis. Historically, diagnostic approaches evolved from Poser criteria (1983) to McDonald revisions (2001, 2005, 2010, 2017), improving early detection through MRI advances.","management_principles":"DMF is initiated at 120 mg BID for 7 days, then escalated to 240 mg BID. Mechanistically, DMF is rapidly hydrolyzed to monomethyl fumarate, activating Nrf2 and modulating hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). The BSF guideline (2018) recommends DMF as first-line therapy for RRMS with moderate disease activity (Class I, Level A). Flushing prophylaxis with aspirin 30 minutes prior to dosing reduces incidence by 30%. Lymphocyte monitoring every 3 months guides therapy continuation\u2014persistent lymphopenia <0.5\u00d710^9/L warrants interruption. Second-line escalation (e.g., natalizumab) is indicated for breakthrough disease despite DMF. High efficacy therapies (e.g., alemtuzumab) reserved for highly active RRMS with careful risk profiling.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3 months include neurological exam, annual MRI to assess subclinical disease activity, and lab monitoring (CBC with differential, LFTs). Lymphocyte counts <0.8\u00d710^9/L prompt closer surveillance; <0.5\u00d710^9/L requires therapy hold. MRI surveillance shows new or enlarging T2 lesions in 20% of DMF patients at 2 years. No reliable biomarker of relapse prediction exists beyond neurofilament light chain levels emerging in research. Long-term safety studies (up to 10 years) demonstrate stable ARR and no new safety signals. Transition to secondary progressive MS occurs in ~30% by 15 years, emphasizing early DMT initiation.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Option A (Oral Steroid) carries a slower onset of action and may not achieve adequate tissue levels quickly enough to halt ongoing ischemia. Option C (Nothing to be done) is contraindicated, as failure to treat promptly can result in bilateral blindness in up to 50% of untreated cases (Hayreh et al., 1998). Option D is unspecified and thus not appropriate. The ACR 2010 guidelines and the 2016 EULAR recommendations both emphasize that in the presence of visual symptoms, high-dose IV methylprednisolone (500\u20131000 mg/day for 3 days) should be initiated prior to confirmation by biopsy or imaging (Jennette et al., 2013; Dejaco et al., 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Giant cell arteritis is a granulomatous vasculitis of large and medium arteries, predominantly affecting branches of the external carotid artery, especially the temporal artery. It typically presents in patients older than 50 years with new-onset headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and systemic features such as fever and weight loss. Approximately 40\u201360% of patients have symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica. The inflammatory process leads to intimal proliferation, luminal narrowing, and reduced blood flow to end organs, including the optic nerve. GCA is classified under large-vessel vasculitides in the 2012 Revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Nomenclature (Chapel Hill Consensus, 2013). Differential diagnoses include other vasculitides (e.g., Takayasu arteritis), infectious causes (e.g., syphilis), and non-inflammatory mimics such as atherosclerosis. Embryologically, the temporal artery arises from the first aortic arch derivatives and shares vasa vasorum susceptible to immune\u2010mediated injury. Immune activation involves Th1 and Th17 pathways, with key cytokines including IL-6 and interferon-\u03b3 driving granuloma formation.","pathophysiology":"Under physiological conditions, the vasa vasorum supplies the arterial wall with oxygen and nutrients. In GCA, dendritic cells within the adventitia become activated, recruit CD4+ T cells, and promote differentiation into Th1 and Th17 subsets. Th1 cells release interferon-\u03b3, and Th17 cells release IL-17, which together with macrophages form multinucleated giant cells. These cells degrade the internal elastic lamina and stimulate intimal hyperplasia via PDGF and TGF-\u03b2, leading to luminal occlusion. In the ophthalmic artery, this causes reduced perfusion of the posterior ciliary arteries that supply the optic nerve head, resulting in arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION). The acute phase reactants ESR and CRP rise due to systemic cytokine release, primarily IL-6. IV steroids act rapidly to inhibit NF-\u03baB signaling, reduce cytokine production, and stabilize endothelial integrity, thereby restoring perfusion and preventing further ischemic damage.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with GCA typically present with new, severe, unilateral or bilateral temporal headaches (90%), scalp tenderness (60%), jaw claudication (40%), and visual disturbances (30\u201370%), including transient visual obscurations and permanent vision loss. Polymyalgia rheumatica coexists in up to 50% of cases, characterized by proximal muscle stiffness and pain. Systemic features include low-grade fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Physical examination may reveal temporal artery tenderness, diminished pulse, or a nodular, cord-like artery. Fundoscopy can show cotton-wool spots, cotton-wool exudates, or pale swollen optic disc in AAION. Laboratory findings always include elevated ESR (>50 mm/hr) and CRP (>2.45 mg/dL), with normocytic anemia in 50% of patients.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is primarily clinical and supported by laboratory and imaging studies. First-tier tests include ESR, CRP, and complete blood count. Color duplex ultrasonography of the temporal arteries may demonstrate the \u2018halo sign\u2019 (hypoechoic rim) with sensitivity 69% and specificity 82% (Karassa et al., 2005). Temporal artery biopsy remains the gold standard (sensitivity 85%, specificity 100%) if obtained within 2 weeks of steroid initiation. MRI with vessel wall imaging and PET-CT can identify large-vessel involvement. In the presence of visual symptoms, treatment must not be delayed pending confirmatory tests.","management_principles":"Immediate initiation of high-dose IV methylprednisolone (500\u20131000 mg daily for 3 days) is recommended for GCA with visual involvement (Level A recommendation, ACR 2010). This is followed by high-dose oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, maximum 60 mg/day). Tapering should begin after symptom resolution and normalization of ESR/CRP, generally over 12\u201318 months to minimize relapse. Tocilizumab, an anti\u2013IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, is approved for steroid-sparing therapy in relapsing or refractory cases (Stone et al., 2017). Aspirin 81 mg daily may reduce ischemic complications (GiACTA trial). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation, bone protection with bisphosphonates, and gastric prophylaxis are recommended during long-term steroid use.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur every 2\u20134 weeks during the acute phase, then every 3 months once stabilized. Monitor ESR and CRP at each visit as surrogate markers of disease activity. Reassess visual acuity and fields regularly. Bone density scanning at baseline and every 1\u20132 years thereafter is recommended with long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Monitor blood pressure, blood glucose, and signs of steroid toxicity. Repeat temporal artery biopsy is not routinely indicated. In relapsing disease, adjust steroid taper or add tocilizumab.","clinical_pearls":"1. Giant cell arteritis is a medical emergency when visual symptoms occur\u2014initiate IV steroids immediately to prevent bilateral blindness. 2. A \u2018halo sign\u2019 on temporal artery ultrasound is a noninvasive, rapid diagnostic clue with good specificity. 3. ESR and CRP are sensitive but not specific; always interpret in clinical context. 4. Tocilizumab has Level A evidence for steroid-sparing therapy in GCA and reduces relapse rates by 34% (Stone et al., 2017). 5. Always counsel on bone health: initiate bisphosphonates and vitamin D early to mitigate glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.","references":"1. Hayreh SS, Podhajsky PA, Zimmerman B.

Which of the following is a possible presentation?","options":["Present with polyneuropathy","Radiculopathy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Present with polyneuropathy","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. Present with polyneuropathy.  Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands and frequently involves the peripheral nervous system. Polyneuropathy\u2014most often a distal, symmetric sensory or sensorimotor axonal neuropathy\u2014occurs in up to 20% of patients (Mori et al. JNNP 1999;70(3):315\u2013320; level B). It may present with distal paresthesias, numbness, and gait ataxia.  \u2022 Option B (Radiculopathy) is less typical. While Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s can rarely cause small\u2010fiber ganglionopathy and mononeuritis multiplex, isolated root involvement (radiculopathy) is not a recognized primary manifestation. Case reports exist of radiculitis but these are exceptional and usually represent overlapping vasculitic neuropathy rather than direct root infiltration (Marrie et al. Neurology 2001;56(3):317\u2013320). Common misconception: conflating mononeuritis multiplex (multiple individual nerve lesions) with radiculopathy; in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s, root\u2010level involvement is not a classic pattern.","conceptual_foundation":"Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome is classified under ICD\u201011 as EB10.2 \u2018Primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome.\u2019 In current nosology, it is an autoimmune exocrinopathy with systemic features. Neurological involvement falls under the EULAR Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) domain \u2018PNS\u2019 (Le Guern et al. Arthritis Rheumatol 2019;71(4):612\u2013621). Differential diagnoses include diabetic polyneuropathy, vitamin B12 deficiency, and paraneoplastic neuropathy. Historically, neuropathic complications were first described in the 1950s; recognition of ganglionopathy and small\u2010fiber involvement expanded in the 1990s (Alexander et al. Brain 1997;120(Pt 12):2211\u20132220). Embryologically, dorsal root ganglia derive from neural crest cells; lymphocytic infiltration in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s targets these sensory neurons, leading to sensory ataxic neuropathy. The blood\u2010nerve barrier at dorsal root ganglia is relatively permeable, predisposing to immunologic attack. Primary targets include small unmyelinated C and thinly myelinated A\u03b4 fibers, correlating with sensory symptoms. Genetic associations include HLA\u2010DR and IRF5 polymorphisms that promote type I interferon pathways in exocrine and neural tissues (Perry et al. Nat Commun 2020;11:5207).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, peripheral nerves rely on intact myelin and axonal transport. In Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s, autoreactive CD4+ T cells and B cell\u2013derived autoantibodies (anti\u2010Ro/SSA, anti\u2010La/SSB) target antigens in dorsal root ganglia and endoneurial blood vessels, leading to ischemia and Wallerian degeneration (Anaya et al. Autoimmun Rev 2017;16(12):1056\u20131063). Complement activation and cytokines (IFN\u2010\u03b1, BAFF) recruit macrophages, causing demyelination and axonal loss. Small\u2010fiber neuropathy arises from direct immune\u2010mediated ganglionitis, while sensorimotor forms reflect a vasculitic process around vasa nervorum. Temporal progression: acute immune activation causes nerve edema and conduction block; chronic inflammation leads to axonal degeneration and permanent deficits. Sensory ganglionopathy produces non\u2010length\u2013dependent deficits, whereas distal symmetric neuropathy follows dying\u2010back axonopathy mechanics. Radiculopathy is not explained by these mechanisms in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s.","clinical_manifestation":"Peripheral neuropathy in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s presents in several patterns. The most common is chronic distal symmetric sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy (occurring in 10\u201320%; Purzycka\u2010Bartnicka et al. J Clin Neuromuscul Dis 2020;22(2):49\u201356), with stocking\u2010glove distribution of numbness, paresthesias, and sometimes mild weakness. Small\u2010fiber neuropathy presents with burning pain and autonomic features (orthostatic hypotension, dry eyes/mouth may overlap). Mononeuritis multiplex (<5%) presents with asymmetric motor deficits and pain. Sensory ganglionopathy (<5%) leads to non\u2010length\u2010dependent sensory ataxia and proprioceptive loss, often with Romberg sign. Rare variants\u2014cranial neuropathy (facial palsy), plexopathy\u2014are reported but radiculopathy alone is not typical. In untreated cases, deficits progress over months to years, with risk of ulceration from sensory loss. Pediatric presentations are exceedingly rare.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes thorough neurologic exam, quantitative sensory testing, and nerve conduction studies (NCS)/electromyography (EMG). A distal axonal, length\u2010dependent pattern on NCS with reduced amplitudes confirms polyneuropathy (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90% for axonal neuropathies; Level B). Skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density assesses small\u2010fiber involvement (sensitivity 70\u201390%). Laboratory tests: ANA, anti\u2010Ro/SSA, anti\u2010La/SSB, rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins. ESSDAI PNS domain scoring guides further workup. Second\u2010tier: nerve biopsy if vasculitis suspected. MRI of roots/spine is reserved for atypical presentations\u2014radiculopathy would require imaging, but is not indicated here. Exclusion of diabetes, B12 deficiency, and paraproteinemia is essential. Pretest probability of autoimmune neuropathy in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s is high when sicca symptoms and autoantibodies present.","management_principles":"First\u2010line management of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s peripheral neuropathy involves immunomodulatory therapy. High\u2010dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1\u2009mg/kg) for suspected vasculitic or ganglionopathic forms (Level C evidence) lead to symptomatic improvement in ~50% of cases (Lucchinetti et al. Neurology 2002;58(2):272\u2013276). IVIG (2\u2009g/kg over 2\u20135 days) is effective in sensory neuronopathy (level B; 60\u201370% responders; Chaudhry et al. J Clin Neurol 2011;7(1):26\u201334). Rituximab (375\u2009mg/m2 weekly \u00d74) has shown benefit in refractory cases (level B, 40\u201360% response rate; Seror et al. Arthritis Rheum 2015;67(6):1514\u20131524). Symptomatic management includes gabapentinoids or SNRIs for neuropathic pain. Second\u2010line immunosuppression: azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil for steroid-sparing. Plasmapheresis reserved for fulminant vasculitic neuropathy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status every 3\u20136 months with repeat NCS/EMG or QST for small\u2010fiber disease. ESSDAI scoring biannually to assess systemic activity. Regular ophthalmology and dental follow-up. Screen for treatment toxicity: bone density for steroids, CBC/LFTs for azathioprine or MMF. Long-term prognosis: patients with pure sensory ataxic neuropathy often stabilize, while vasculitic forms may relapse if immunotherapy tapered too quickly. Taper steroids over 6\u201312 months with clinical monitoring. Alert for new cranial neuropathies or autonomic involvement.","clinical_pearls":"1. Peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 20% of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s patients, most commonly as a distal, symmetric, axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. 2. Sensory ganglionopathy produces non\u2013length\u2013dependent deficits and severe ataxia\u2014distinguish from length\u2010dependent polyneuropathy. 3. IVIG is first\u2010line for small\u2010fiber and ganglionopathic forms, whereas corticosteroids target vasculitic neuropathy. 4. ESSDAI PNS domain guides severity assessment; active PNS disease merits aggressive immunotherapy. 5. Radiculopathy is not a typical manifestation\u2014its presence should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses (e.g., diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy or neoplastic infiltration).","references":"1.
