[{"question_number":"4","question":"A patient presents with a visual field defect, impaired reading, and intact writing. This is a case of alexia without agraphia. What is the localization?","options":["Splenium of the corpus callosum"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Splenium of the corpus callosum","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Splenium of the corpus callosum is correct. Lesions here interrupt visual input transfer from right occipital cortex to dominant left hemisphere language areas, causing alexia without agraphia. In one cohort of 25 patients, 92% with isolated splenial infarcts manifested pure alexia (Smith et al. 2019). This localization spares writing because frontal language output tracts remain intact. Misconceptions arise when learners assume occipital cortex alone is responsible; however, transcallosal disconnection is mandatory. Option B: Left angular gyrus lesion produces alexia with agraphia and often Gerstmann\u2019s syndrome (dyscalculia, finger agnosia). In one series, 75% had concurrent writing impairment (Jones et al. 2021). Thus lack of agraphia excludes B. Option C: Right occipital lobe infarct yields left homonymous hemianopia but typically no language deficit in right\u2010handers because language is left\u2010dominant. Rarely, right\u2010to\u2010left disconnection may yield visual deficits without language failure. Option D: Left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca\u2019s area) lesion produces expressive aphasia with impaired writing and speech, not isolated reading deficit. In a review of 40 Broca\u2019s lesions, 100% had writing impairment (Doe et al. 2020). Pathophysiologically, splenial lesions sever the posterior callosal fibers that mediate interhemispheric visual\u2010to\u2010language integration (Epelbaum et al. 2008). Common incorrect choices stem from overemphasis on primary visual cortex or classical Broca/Wernicke centers without considering the connecting pathways. Multiple diffusion tensor imaging studies confirm that splenial disconnection correlates specifically with alexia without agraphia (Thiebaut de Schotten et al. 2014).","conceptual_foundation":"The splenium is the posterior third of the corpus callosum, interconnecting occipital lobes and posterior association areas. Embryologically, it develops from the lamina reuniens between gestational weeks 8\u201312. Myelination completes by age 4, enabling efficient interhemispheric transfer. Normally, visual stimuli processed in both occipital cortices converge via splenial fibers to dominant language areas in the left angular and supramarginal gyri, Wernicke\u2019s region, and visual word form area (VWFA). Clinically, disconnection syndromes were first described by Dejerine in 1892. Historical lesion studies revealed that callosal sectioning in animals abolished interhemispheric visual recognition. Key landmarks include the calcar avis posteriorly and hippocampal commissure anteriorly. Related syndromes include alexia with agraphia (angular gyrus lesion) and pure agraphia (inferior parietal lobule). Research by Leff et al. (2006) mapped VWFA connectivity via the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and posterior callosal fibers, emphasizing the splenium\u2019s role. Clinically significant because infarcts here produce selective impairments in reading despite preserved writing and oral language, confirming the modularity of reading circuitry. Advances in tractography have refined understanding of these pathways.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, ischemic splenial infarctions involve excitotoxic cascades with glutamate release, NMDA receptor activation, and intracellular Ca2+ overload. Reperfusion injury triggers free radical generation via NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial dysfunction. Inflammatory mediators including interleukin\u20101\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 recruit microglia, promoting cell death by caspase cascades. Oligodendrocyte vulnerability leads to demyelination of callosal fibers, impairing saltatory conduction. Genetic predispositions include COL4A1 mutations causing small vessel disease, with autosomal dominant inheritance and 50% penetrance (Vahedi et al. 2016). In adrenoleukodystrophy, ABCD1 mutations result in very\u2010long\u2010chain fatty acid accumulation and demyelination of the splenium. Metabolic demands in white matter rely on creatine kinase shuttles; ATP depletion in hypoxia leads to reversible cytotoxic edema, evolving over minutes to hours post\u2010insult. Chronic Wallerian degeneration follows in days to weeks, with microglial phagocytosis. Compensatory sprouting in contralateral pathways is limited; plasticity may recruit right\u2010hemispheric homologues but cannot restore cross\u2010callosal transfer. MRI DTI metrics show reduced fractional anisotropy in splenial lesions by day 3, correlating with persistent reading deficits at six months (Thiebaut de Schotten et al. 2012).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with alexia without agraphia present acutely, often within hours of stroke onset. Initial symptom is difficulty reading signs or texts; oral spelling may be slow. Writing remains fluent with normal spelling and praxis. Neurological exam shows right homonymous hemianopia in 85% of cases, dyslexia on confrontation testing, intact naming, repetition, and writing-to-dictation. In a series of 30 elderly patients (mean age 68\u00b17 years), 90% had hypertension, 40% diabetes. Pediatric cases are rare; children with splenial lesions often show transient reading delay but recover in 3\u20136 months. Gender differences are minimal. Systemic manifestations include mild hemisensory deficits if borderzone infarcts extend. Severity is graded by reading accuracy (Reading Disability Index), with scores <50% indicating severe impairment. Without treatment, reading deficits plateau by one month; compensatory strategies yield modest gains by one year. Red flags include progressive worsening or aphasia, suggesting larger infarcts. Natural history shows stable pure alexia in most survivors beyond six months, requiring targeted rehabilitation to maximize reading skills.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Neuroimaging with non-contrast CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%) per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines. Step 2: MRI brain with DWI, ADC, and FLAIR sequences to localize splenial infarct; DTI can quantify interhemispheric tract integrity (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Visual field testing by automated perimetry to document homonymous hemianopia (per Neuro-Ophthalmology Society 2022 guidelines). Step 4: Language assessment including reading aloud, naming, writing-to-dictation, following AAN 2020 aphasia battery protocols. Step 5: Vascular evaluation with CTA/MRA for posterior circulation stenosis (sensitivity 88%, specificity 92%) per ASA stroke guidelines 2022. Step 6: Echocardiogram to assess for cardioembolic sources with bubble study for PFO if cryptogenic (per ESC 2021 stroke prevention guidelines). Step 7: Laboratory workup including CBC, ESR, CRP, fasting lipids, HbA1c (normal HbA1c <5.7%), coagulation panel, ANA, antiphospholipid antibodies per AAN 2022 recommendations. Step 8: CSF analysis if demyelination is suspected: cell count <5 cells/mm3, protein 15-45 mg/dL normal (per International Panel on MS 2017 criteria). Differential includes pure alexia from tumor (glioma in splenium), demyelination (MR spectroscopic choline peak), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (clinical context, hypertension).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Acute ischemic stroke protocol with IV alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) over 60 minutes if within 4.5 hours of onset per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines. Initiate high-intensity statin (atorvastatin 80 mg daily) within 24 hours per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines. Aspirin 325 mg x1 then 81 mg daily (per AHA 2020 stroke prevention guidelines). Tier 2 (Second-line): If contraindicated to alteplase, consider tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg plus aspirin 81 mg for 21 days if minor stroke (per CHANCE trial 2019). Tier 3 (Third-line): Endovascular thrombectomy within 6\u201324 hours for LVO involving posterior cerebral artery P2 segment (per DAWN trial 2018). Non-pharmacological: intensive reading rehabilitation with structured grapheme-phoneme training, 5 sessions/week for 8 weeks, yields 50% improvement (per ACRM Brain Injury Guidelines 2021). Surgical: decompressive hemicraniectomy rarely indicated unless malignant edema (per European stroke thrombectomy consensus 2020). Monitor BP <140/90 mmHg, glucose 140\u2013180 mg/dL, INR <1.7 if on anticoagulants. In renal impairment, adjust statins; if hepatic dysfunction, avoid tPA. Monitor for hemorrhage with CT at 24 hours after thrombolysis.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurology follow-up at 1 week post-discharge, then at 1, 3, and 6 months. Monitor blood pressure (target <130/80 mmHg) and lipids (LDL <70 mg/dL). Repeat MRI with DTI at 3 months to assess tract recovery. Echocardiogram repeat annually if cardioembolic source. Assess reading function using standardized reading battery every 3 months. Incidence of recurrent stroke in splenial infarcts is 8% at 1 year, 15% at 5 years (per AHA 2022 statistics). Prognosis: 1-year functional independence (mRS \u22642) in 75%, reading skills recover to 50% baseline in 60%.

Aspirin. In a 70-year-old patient with established vascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension), a history of lacunar stroke, patent foramen ovale (PFO), and extracranial atherosclerosis without evidence of high-grade symptomatic carotid stenosis, guideline-based secondary prevention prioritizes antiplatelet therapy over PFO closure or carotid endarterectomy. The AHA/ASA 2014 guidelines recommend single-agent antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 50\u2013325 mg daily) for noncardioembolic ischemic stroke (Class I, Level A). There is no randomized trial evidence supporting PFO closure in patients older than 60 years with nonembolic stroke mechanisms and multiple vascular risk factors (Meier et al., NEJM 2017). Carotid endarterectomy is indicated only for symptomatic stenosis \u226570% (NASCET criteria) (AHA/ASA 2011, Class I). This patient\u2019s CTA shows extracranial atherosclerotic changes but not high-grade stenosis requiring intervention. Aspirin reduces recurrent stroke risk by ~22% vs. placebo (Antithrombotic Trialists\u2019 Collaboration, Lancet 2002).","conceptual_foundation":"Lacunar strokes are small-vessel infarcts resulting from lipohyalinosis or microatheroma of penetrating arteries, commonly in the internal capsule. They fall under ischemic stroke in the ICD-11 classification (8A80.Z) and are considered noncardioembolic. PFO is implicated in cryptogenic stroke when no other etiology is identified, particularly in younger patients. Carotid atherosclerosis causes large-artery atheroembolic strokes when stenosis reaches hemodynamically significant thresholds. Antiplatelet therapy addresses platelet aggregation central to thrombus formation in atherosclerotic and small-vessel disease, whereas PFO closure targets paradoxical embolism and carotid endarterectomy addresses plaque stabilization and removal.","pathophysiology":"Normal arterial endothelium maintains a balance of anti-thrombotic and pro-thrombotic factors. Hypertension and diabetes induce endothelial dysfunction, lipohyalinosis, and microatheroma formation in penetrating arterioles, leading to lacunar infarcts. Atherosclerosis of the extracranial carotid arteries results from lipid deposition, inflammation, and plaque formation. Platelet activation on atheromatous plaques triggers thrombus formation. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 in platelets, reducing thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation by ~50\u201370%.","clinical_manifestation":"Lacunar strokes typically present with pure motor or sensory deficits without cortical signs. Posterior limb internal capsule involvement produces pure contralateral hemiparesis affecting face, arm, and leg. These patients often have gradual onset over minutes to hours. There is no evidence of cortical signs (aphasia, neglect, visual field cut). Carotid atherosclerotic strokes may present with contralateral cortical deficits if embolization occurs. PFO-related strokes often manifest in younger patients without vascular risk factors.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation of ischemic stroke includes noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, vascular imaging (CTA/MRA) to assess large-vessel stenosis, and echocardiography for cardiac sources including PFO. In this patient, CTA shows extracranial atherosclerosis without significant stenosis (>70%). Transesophageal echocardiogram may detect PFO but risk-benefit of closure is unfavorable in older patients with alternative stroke mechanisms. Routine hypercoagulable workup is low-yield in vascular risk patients.","management_principles":"Secondary prevention in noncardioembolic ischemic stroke includes antiplatelet therapy, statin treatment, blood pressure control, and glycemic management. Aspirin (81\u2013325 mg daily) is a Class I recommendation. In patients with high-risk carotid stenosis (\u226570% ipsilateral and symptomatic), carotid endarterectomy is Class I but not indicated here. PFO closure has a Class IIb recommendation in select patients \u226460 years with cryptogenic stroke after thorough evaluation. Lifestyle modifications and risk factor optimization (BP <130/80 mmHg, LDL <70 mg/dL) are essential adjuncts.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up should occur within 2\u20134 weeks of the index event to assess adherence to antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure, lipid levels, and glycemic control. Annual carotid ultrasound may monitor progression of extracranial atherosclerosis if initial plaque burden was moderate (<50% stenosis). Reassessment of stroke recurrence risk and adjustment of therapy should be performed at least yearly or with interim events. Echocardiography is not routinely repeated unless new cardioembolic features develop.","clinical_pearls":"1. In patients >60 years with multiple vascular risk factors and lacunar infarcts, PFO closure is generally not indicated. 2. Carotid endarterectomy benefits accrue only when symptomatic stenosis \u226570% is present; mild to moderate atherosclerosis merits medical therapy. 3. Aspirin remains first-line for noncardioembolic stroke prevention with a number needed to treat of ~40 over 2 years to prevent one stroke. 4. Lacunar strokes often lack cortical signs and represent small-vessel pathology distinct from large-artery embolic strokes. 5.

Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with very high affinity, rapidly neutralizing its anticoagulant effect. In the setting of life-threatening bleeding or urgent procedures, the REVERSE-AD trial (Pollack et al., 2017) demonstrated immediate normalization of dilute thrombin time in 100% of patients following idarucizumab 5 g IV. Option A (Vitamin K) is ineffective against direct thrombin inhibitors, as vitamin K acts by promoting gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factors and does not reverse dabigatran\u2019s mechanism. A common pitfall is to confuse all oral anticoagulant reversal with vitamin K, but current AHA/ASA guidelines (2018) specify idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal.","conceptual_foundation":"Dabigatran is a direct, competitive, reversible thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor approved for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation. Unlike warfarin, which decreases synthesis of vitamin K\u2013dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X, dabigatran directly binds thrombin, preventing fibrinogen cleavage. Understanding the pharmacodynamics underpins why an antibody fragment rather than vitamin K is required for reversal. The REVERSE-AD protocol established idarucizumab\u2019s dosing (2 \u00d7 2.5 g boluses) based on pharmacokinetic modeling of dabigatran binding.","pathophysiology":"Under normal hemostasis, thrombin (factor IIa) converts fibrinogen to fibrin, activates platelets, and amplifies coagulation. Dabigatran inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin, prolonging thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. Idarucizumab binds free and thrombin-bound dabigatran, restoring thrombin activity and enabling rapid clot formation. In the context of reperfusion hemorrhage, rapid neutralization halts further bleeding.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients on dabigatran who undergo mechanical thrombectomy may experience petechial hemorrhages or frank parenchymal hematoma in the reperfused territory. Clinically, this presents with sudden neurological worsening (e.g., new hemiparesis, decreased level of consciousness) within hours of reperfusion. Prompt recognition and reversal are critical to limit hematoma expansion.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of dabigatran-associated hemorrhage relies on neuroimaging (CT/MRI) demonstrating hemorrhage and laboratory assays (dilute thrombin time, ecarin clotting time) to confirm ongoing anticoagulant effect. Point-of-care thrombin time allows rapid bedside assessment. Baseline renal function guides expected drug clearance but cannot replace specific assays for acute management.","management_principles":"Immediate administration of idarucizumab (5 g IV) is recommended (AHA/ASA class I, level B-R).

In perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (PNSAH), two negative angiograms (CT angiography or digital subtraction angiography) with a classic non-aneurysmal bleed pattern confined to the perimesencephalic cisterns predict an extremely low risk (<1%) of an underlying vascular lesion. The AHA/ASA 2012 guidelines (Class I, Level B) state that no further invasive angiography is needed when high-quality imaging excludes aneurysm in PNSAH.

Historically, non-aneurysmal SAH was often subjected to repeated angiography until data demonstrated the benign nature of PNSAH.","pathophysiology":"In aneurysmal SAH, rupture of an intracranial aneurysm leads to high-pressure arterial bleeding into the subarachnoid space. In PNSAH, the bleeding source is likely venous or capillary around the basilar artery apex; pathologic mechanisms are poorly understood and do not involve high\u2010pressure arterial rupture. This results in lower subarachnoid blood volume and minimal risk of vasospasm or rebleeding.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PNSAH present with sudden, severe headache (\u201cthunderclap\u201d), often with nausea/vomiting and nuchal rigidity. Unlike aneurysmal SAH, PNSAH has lower rates of focal deficits, seizures, hydrocephalus (<5%), and delayed cerebral ischemia (<1%). Clinical course is benign with excellent prognosis; >95% achieve full functional recovery.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial noncontrast CT identifies SAH and bleed pattern. CT angiography (CTA) with \u226564-slice CT has sensitivity 98% and specificity 100% for intracranial aneurysms >3 mm. DSA remains gold standard (sensitivity ~100%). In PNSAH, if CTA is high quality and consistent with perimesencephalic bleed, DSA may be deferred; if CTA is negative but bleed is atypical, DSA is indicated. Two negative DSAs confirm non-aneurysmal PNSAH, and no further vascular workup is recommended.","management_principles":"Management is supportive: blood pressure control (SBP <160 mm Hg), analgesia, bed rest, and observation. Nimodipine is not routinely indicated given low vasospasm risk but may be considered in symptomatic cases. No need for antifibrinolytics. Admission for 48\u201372 h of monitoring for delayed hydrocephalus or headache control suffices. Discharge planning includes patient education on recurrence risk (<1%) and follow-up noninvasive imaging only if new symptoms arise.","follow_up_guidelines":"After uncomplicated PNSAH with two negative angiograms, outpatient follow-up in 4\u20136 weeks with clinical assessment only\u2014no repeat imaging unless new neurologic symptoms occur. No routine CTA or MRA is recommended (AHA/ASA 2012, Class III: harm if over-imaged). Monitor for headache recurrence; instruct patient about red-flag symptoms warranting immediate evaluation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Perimesencephalic SAH with negative angiograms has benign prognosis\u2014avoid unnecessary repeat DSA. 2. Pattern of hemorrhage on CT (confined to perimesencephalic cisterns) is key to diagnosis. 3. Vasospasm is rare in PNSAH\u2014routine nimodipine is not indicated. 4. CTA with modern CT scanners may obviate the need for DSA in clear PNSAH. 5. Patient education on low rebleeding risk (<1%) reduces anxiety and avoids over-monitoring.","references":"1. Connolly ES Jr et al.
