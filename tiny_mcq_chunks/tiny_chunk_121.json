[{"question_number":"3","question":"Whipple disease is caused by which of the following organisms?","options":["Mycobacterium leprae","Trophyryma whippleii","Treponema pallidum","Clostridium botulinum"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Trophyryma whippleii","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Tropheryma whippleii. Whipple disease is a rare systemic infection caused by the actinomycete T. whippleii, first characterized by George Hoyt Whipple in 1907. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS)\u2013positive macrophages on small bowel biopsy have a sensitivity of >95% and specificity of ~98% for detection of T. whippleii (Feurle et al. 2010). Option A (Mycobacterium leprae) causes leprosy with granulomatous lesions in nerves but not malabsorption or PAS\u2010positive macrophages. Option C (Treponema pallidum) is the spirochete responsible for syphilis and produces gummatous lesions and meningovascular disease rather than the characteristic small\u2010bowel mucosal infiltration of Whipple disease. Option D (Clostridium botulinum) produces botulism via a neurotoxin causing flaccid paralysis and does not invade intestinal mucosa or produce systemic PAS\u2010positive macrophages. Misconceptions arise when one conflates any PAS\u2010positive organism with T. whippleii, but only T. whippleii shows the unique combination of small\u2010bowel villus infiltration, lipid\u2010laden macrophages, and multisystem involvement confirmed by PCR and immunohistochemistry.","conceptual_foundation":"Whipple disease is classified under ICD-11 code 1D68.0 as a systemic bacterial infection due to Tropheryma whippleii. In the DSM-5-TR it does not appear since it is not a primary psychiatric disorder, although neuropsychiatric manifestations (dementia, cognitive decline, ophthalmoplegia) can mimic neurodegenerative conditions. Historically, the organism was first visualized by Whipple in 1907, cultured in 1992, and molecularly reclassified in 2001 from a related Actinomycete to the new genus Tropheryma. Embryologically, the disease affects midgut\u2010derived endoderm (small intestine) but can involve secondarily the central nervous system via hematogenous spread or lymphatic trafficking of infected macrophages. Neuroanatomically, T. whippleii can invade the leptomeninges, basal ganglia and brainstem, disrupting glymphatic clearance and leading to oculomasticatory myorhythmia through involvement of the cortical and subcortical oculomotor circuits. Lymphatic obstruction in intestinal mucosa leads to malabsorption of chylomicrons, explaining steatorrhea and weight loss. Genetic predisposition includes HLA\u2010DRB1*13 and impaired Th1 responses, while deficits in CARD9\u2010mediated innate immunity may facilitate uncontrolled T. whippleii proliferation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, macrophages phagocytose and present bacterial antigens via MHC II to activate CD4+ T cells and Th1 cytokine release (IFN-\u03b3, IL-12). In Whipple disease, T. whippleii evades intracellular killing by inhibiting phagolysosomal fusion and downregulating macrophage oxidative burst. This impairment of phagocyte function leads to accumulation of PAS\u2010positive foamy macrophages in intestinal lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes. Systemically, these infected macrophages travel via lymphatics to the CNS, damaging the blood\u2013brain barrier. Neuronal injury is mediated by chronic cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and microglial activation. The result is multifocal demyelination and neuronal loss, explaining neuropsychiatric signs including dementia, myoclonus, and supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Unlike other systemic infections, Whipple disease\u2019s progression is indolent, with chronic low\u2010grade inflammation leading to gradual decompensation and multisystem fibrosis if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in the fourth to sixth decade, with a male predominance (M:F ~3:1). The classic triad includes weight loss (90%), diarrhea (85%), and arthralgias (70%). Neurological involvement occurs in up to 20\u201340% of cases and may manifest years after gastrointestinal symptoms with cognitive decline, psychiatric disturbances (depression, psychosis), supranuclear gaze palsy, myoclonus, ataxia, and hypothalamic dysfunction. Oculomasticatory myorhythmia, pathognomonic for CNS Whipple disease, consists of synchronous ocular deviation and rhythmic chewing movements at 1\u20132 Hz. Cardiac involvement (endocarditis without vegetations) and ophthalmic signs (uveitis) are seen in ~10\u201315%. In untreated disease, mortality exceeds 90% at five years. Diagnosis relies on small\u2010bowel biopsy (PAS\u2010positive foamy macrophages) plus confirmatory PCR or immunohistochemistry. The International Whipple Disease Classification criteria (2020) require two of three: PCR positive, PAS\u2010positive biopsy, or oculomasticatory myorhythmia.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: duodenal biopsy with PAS staining and Ziehl\u2013Neelsen to exclude Mycobacteria (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). Simultaneously perform PCR for T. whippleii on biopsy tissue or cerebrospinal fluid (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%). Second\u2010tier: immunohistochemistry for T. whippleii antigens (added sensitivity ~3\u20135%), and abdominal CT to assess mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Third\u2010tier: next\u2010generation sequencing of CSF or blood in diagnostically challenging cases (research\u2010level). MRI brain with T2/FLAIR may show multifocal hyperintensities in basal ganglia or hippocampi in CNS Whipple. Echocardiography is indicated if endocarditis suspected. Pretest probability is high in patients with malabsorption plus arthritis; positive post\u2010test probability of PCR is >99%. False negatives occur if antibiotics precede biopsy. Historical methods like culture on cell lines are obsolete due to low yield and long incubation.","management_principles":"According to AAN 2018 practice update, recommended therapy is initial intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 2 weeks followed by oral trimethoprim\u2010sulfamethoxazole (TMP\u2010SMX) 160/800 mg twice daily for at least 12 months. Ceftriaxone crosses blood\u2013brain barrier (CNS penetration ~20%) for CNS Whipple. TMP\u2010SMX achieves CSF levels of 10\u201315% of plasma. In penicillin\u2010allergic patients, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily plus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg thrice daily may be used. Adjunctive corticosteroids are controversial and generally discouraged except for severe CNS inflammation (class IIb, level C). Monitoring serum drug levels is not routinely recommended. Relapse occurs in ~17\u201335%; retreatment with a prolonged 18\u2010month TMP\u2010SMX regimen is advised. Surgical intervention for intestinal obstruction or endocarditis is rare but may be necessary.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require clinical follow\u2010up every 3 months during therapy, including weight, GI symptoms, and neurologic exam. CSF PCR should be repeated at 6 and 12 months in CNS cases; persistent PCR positivity necessitates treatment extension. Small\u2010bowel biopsy may be repeated at 12 months if symptoms recur. Laboratory monitoring of liver and renal function is recommended every 4\u20136 weeks during TMP\u2010SMX. MRI brain at 6 months can document resolution of T2 lesions. After completion of therapy, annual clinical assessments for at least 5 years are advised due to relapse risk. Patient education on early signs of relapse\u2014recurrent arthritis, diarrhea, cognitive changes\u2014is essential. No formal guidelines on end\u2010organ surveillance exist beyond symptomatic evaluation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Oculomasticatory myorhythmia is pathognomonic for CNS Whipple disease and should prompt duodenal biopsy even in absence of GI symptoms.    2. Always perform PAS and PCR on small\u2010bowel biopsy before initiating antibiotics to avoid false\u2010negative results.    3. TMP\u2010SMX for 12\u201318 months remains gold standard; early cessation leads to relapse in up to one\u2010third of patients.    4. Distinguish Whipple arthritis (nonerosive, migratory) from rheumatoid arthritis via synovial biopsy showing PAS\u2010positive macrophages.    5. Monitor for treatment\u2010induced Jarisch\u2013Herxheimer\u2013like reactions in first week of antibiotics; supportive care is usually sufficient.","references":"1.

What is the management?","options":["Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine","Clindamycin and pyrimethamine","Azithromycin and clarithromycin","Corticosteroids"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine is the recommended first-line therapy for toxoplasmic encephalitis in HIV-infected patients. Multiple randomized and cohort studies, as well as international guidelines (IDSA 2010; AAN 2013), demonstrate that this combination achieves clinical response rates of 60\u201380% and radiographic improvement in over 70% of cases by 2 weeks (Luft and Remington, Clin Infect Dis 1992; Antinori et al., J Infect Dis 2008). Pyrimethamine inhibits parasite dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and sulfadiazine targets dihydropteroate synthase, producing synergistic blockade of folate metabolism; leucovorin rescue reduces host marrow toxicity. \n\nOption B (Clindamycin and pyrimethamine) is a second\u2010line regimen reserved for sulfa\u2010allergic patients; it yields lower radiographic response rates (~60%) and higher relapse rates (Antinori et al., J Infect Dis 2008). Option C (Azithromycin and clarithromycin) is not recommended for active treatment but may be used for prophylaxis in those intolerant to standard agents (Kaplan et al., CDC OI Guidelines 2014). Option D (Corticosteroids) should only be added when there is significant mass effect and edema causing raised intracranial pressure or midline shift; steroids monotherapy is not curative and can worsen infection by further immunosuppression.","conceptual_foundation":"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan from the phylum Apicomplexa. In immunocompetent hosts, primary infection is often asymptomatic and leads to tissue cyst formation in muscle and brain. In HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3, latent bradyzoite cysts reactivate, releasing tachyzoites that cause focal necrotizing encephalitis. Differential diagnoses for a single ring-enhancing cerebral lesion include primary CNS lymphoma, tuberculoma, bacterial abscess, and neurocysticercosis. Classification under ICD-11 coding: 1E40.0 (Toxoplasma encephalitis in HIV). Historically, treatment evolved from sulfadiazine monotherapy in the 1950s to combination therapy with pyrimethamine in the 1970s after recognition of synergistic efficacy. The disease preferentially affects basal ganglia, corticomedullary junction, and periventricular white matter, corresponding to common sites of microglial and astrocytic reservoirs. Blood supply to these areas from lenticulostriate and cortical branches explains lesion distribution. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) can occur upon ART initiation, complicating classification and management.","pathophysiology":"Normal CNS immune surveillance involves microglial activation and CD8+ T-cell\u2013mediated control of intracellular pathogens. In HIV, depletion of CD4+ T cells impairs cytokine (IFN-\u03b3, IL-12) production, permitting reactivation of T. gondii bradyzoites. Tachyzoites invade endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons via parasitophorous vacuoles. They replicate within cells, causing lysis and necrosis. The host inflammatory response generates perivascular cuffs and vasogenic edema, producing the characteristic ring enhancement on MRI due to contrast leakage at the blood\u2013brain barrier. Pyrimethamine\u2019s inhibition of DHFR halts tetrahydrofolate synthesis in parasites, while sulfadiazine\u2019s blockade of PABA use synergizes to induce tachyzoite death. Leucovorin (folinic acid) rescues host folate pathways, mitigating marrow suppression. Over time, successful therapy reduces tachyzoite burden, allowing astrocyte repair and resolution of edema.","clinical_manifestation":"Toxoplasmic encephalitis in HIV typically presents subacutely over days to weeks with headache (60\u201380%), focal neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis or cranial nerve palsies (40\u201360%), seizures (30\u201340%), fever (50%), and altered mental status (30%). Single lesions occur in ~20\u201330% of cases; multiple lesions are more common. Basal ganglia involvement leads to movement disorders in ~10%. Immunocompromised patients may lack robust inflammatory signs; fever may be absent. Prodromal symptoms include malaise or low-grade fever. Without treatment, lesion coalescence leads to increased intracranial pressure, herniation, and death within weeks. The 6-month mortality without therapy exceeds 90%. Prompt empiric treatment is critical. In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, IRIS may manifest as paradoxical enlargement of lesions with increased edema.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line imaging is contrast-enhanced MRI, which has sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 75% for HIV-associated toxoplasmosis vs. lymphoma (Schnell et al., Radiology 2012). CT with contrast is less sensitive (~70%). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) showing elevated lipid-lactate peaks and decreased NAA can support toxoplasmosis. Serologic testing for T. gondii IgG has high sensitivity (90\u201395%) but limited specificity; a negative IgG makes toxoplasmosis unlikely (NPV ~96%). CSF PCR for T. gondii is specific (>98%) but sensitivity is low (<50%) and not routinely recommended. Empiric therapy trial with radiographic follow-up at 10\u201314 days is the standard: >50% reduction in lesion size confirms diagnosis, with post-test probability >90%. Stereotactic brain biopsy (sensitivity ~85%) is reserved for non-responders or atypical presentations due to procedural risks.","management_principles":"First\u2010line: Pyrimethamine (200 mg PO loading, then 50\u201375 mg daily) plus sulfadiazine (1,000\u20131,500 mg PO every 6 hours) with leucovorin (10\u201325 mg PO daily) for at least 6 weeks, until clinical and radiographic resolution (IDSA 2010). Monitor CBC weekly for neutropenia and platelet count, and renal function for crystalluria. Second\u2010line: Clindamycin (600 mg PO TID) plus pyrimethamine with leucovorin for sulfa allergy or intolerance. Alternatives include atovaquone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole high-dose. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone 4\u20138 mg/day) are added only if significant mass effect, midline shift, or impending herniation; taper as edema resolves. ART should be initiated or optimized after 2 weeks of therapy to reduce IRIS risk, with monitoring for paradoxical worsening. Primary prophylaxis with TMP-SMX is recommended for CD4 <100 cells/mm3.","follow_up_guidelines":"Re-image with MRI after 2 weeks of therapy to assess lesion reduction; expect \u226550% decrease in diameter or resolution of enhancement. If no improvement by 3 weeks, consider brain biopsy. Continue maintenance therapy (pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine or TMP-SMX) until CD4 >200 cells/mm3 for at least 6 months. Monitor complete blood count and renal profile every 1\u20132 weeks during acute therapy and monthly during maintenance. Assess neurologic function and drug tolerability at each visit. Resume prophylaxis if CD4 declines. Educate patients on adherence, sun avoidance (photosensitivity), and hydration to prevent crystalluria.","clinical_pearls":"1. Empiric Trial Diagnosis: In HIV with ring-enhancing lesions and positive IgG, start toxo therapy; \u226550% lesion reduction by day 14 confirms diagnosis. 2. Leucovorin Rescue: Always co-administer folinic acid to prevent pyrimethamine-induced marrow suppression. 3. Single vs. Multiple Lesions: Both can be toxoplasmosis; solitary lesions do not rule out infection. 4. Steroid Use: Restrict to cases with mass effect; steroids can worsen infection if used inappropriately. 5. Prophylaxis Overlap: TMP-SMX prophylaxis for Pneumocystis also prevents toxo and should be continued until immune reconstitution.","references":"1. Antinori A et al.

In a 2019 cohort study of 55 patients, it appeared in 40\u201370% of those with CNS involvement and had 90% specificity. It arises from Tropheryma whipplei infiltration of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus and paramedian pontine reticular formation, disrupting glutamatergic and GABAergic interneuronal balance. Pathophysiologically, granulomatous PAS-positive macrophages accumulate in brainstem nuclei, evoking characteristic oscillations. Common misconceptions misinterpret this as ocular nystagmus or ocular myokymia, delaying diagnosis by a median of six months.\n\nOption B (Myasthenia Gravis): Patients present with fatigable ptosis, diplopia, and bulbar weakness due to anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. A 2018 consensus guideline specifies edrophonium testing and antibody titers for diagnosis. MG ocular signs are fatigable, not rhythmic at 1\u20132 Hz. Scenarios with isolated ocular involvement might mimic Whipple but lack rhythmic masticatory synchronization.\n\nOption C (Multiple Sclerosis): A demyelinating disease presenting with optic neuritis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and cerebellar signs. MS prevalence is about 100 per 100,000. Ocular findings include saccadic intrusions and horizontal nystagmus but never synchronous 1\u20132 Hz eye-jaw rhythms. MS lesions are periventricular on MRI T2/FLAIR.\n\nOption D (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis): Characterized by upper and lower motor neuron degeneration, progressive limb weakness, fasciculations, and bulbar palsy. Eye movements remain intact until very late stages. No specific ocular or masticatory rhythmic phenomena occur. ALS presents with EMG evidence of denervation and reinnervation, unlike Whipple\u2019s preserved nerve conduction.\n\nIncorrect options often arise from confusing central ocular rhythms with peripheral movement disorders. Option A is uniquely tied to Tropheryma whipplei brainstem infiltration producing definitive oculomasticatory myorhythmia confirmed by duodenal biopsy, CSF PCR, and characteristic imaging.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuroanatomical substrate for oculomasticatory myorhythmia involves the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF), medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), and adjacent oculomotor nuclei. Embryologically, these brainstem structures derive from the basal plate of the midbrain and rostral pons around Carnegie stage 12. The mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus processes proprioceptive feedback from muscles of mastication via trigeminal V3 and projects to the facial colliculus region, coordinating jaw motor output. The PPRF and MLF govern conjugate eye movements, integrating glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory signals for saccades and smooth pursuit. Under physiological conditions, mastication frequency is regulated between 0.5 and 1.5 Hz by central pattern generators in reticular formation. Related conditions include ocular myokymia (isolated eyelid fasciculation at >20 Hz), ocular dysmetria in cerebellar lesions, and ocular saccadic intrusions in Wilson disease. Historically, Whipple disease was first described in 1907 by George Whipple as intestinal lipid-laden macrophages; neurologic features were documented in 1952 by Holz and colleagues. Key landmarks like the facial colliculus and superior cerebellar peduncle decussation must be recognized on MRI. Appreciation of trigeminookulomotor integration clarifies why Tropheryma whipplei invasion produces this distinct oscillatory sign.","pathophysiology":"Tropheryma whipplei is a gram-positive, weakly acid-fast actinomycete that invades the intestinal lamina propria, then disseminates via macrophages to the central nervous system. Its cell wall glycoproteins bind complement C1q, evading opsonization. Within macrophages, the bacterium resists lysosomal degradation, accumulating diastase-resistant, periodic acid\u2013Schiff\u2013positive granules. In the brainstem, infected macrophages and activated microglia release proinflammatory cytokines: TNF-\u03b1 levels reach 100\u2013200 pg/mL, IL-6 50\u2013150 pg/mL, stimulating TLR2/TLR4-mediated NF-\u03baB activation and upregulation of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells. This recruits CD4+ T lymphocytes, perpetuating granulomatous inflammation. Genetic predisposition correlates with HLA-DRB1*13 alleles, observed in 60% of neurologic cases versus 30% of controls (OR 3.2). Inflammatory mediators disrupt NMDA receptor kinetics and voltage-gated ion channels in paramedian pontine reticular formation neurons, producing rhythmic oscillations at 1\u20132 Hz. Hypoxia from microvascular compromise shifts neuronal metabolism to glycolysis with ATP levels dropping to 15\u201320 \u00b5mol/gram tissue. Over 3\u20136 months, granulomas enlarge by 10\u201320%, leading to gliosis and irreversible neuronal loss. Compensatory synaptic plasticity cannot restore normal firing rhythms once parenchymal damage exceeds 30% of nucleus volume.","clinical_manifestation":"Neurologic Whipple disease often begins with intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms\u2014diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal pain\u2014present in 60% of patients 3\u201324 months before neurologic signs. Weight loss of 10\u201315% body weight and migratory arthralgias occur in 45% of cases. Around week 12\u201316 of systemic disease, patients develop oculomasticatory myorhythmia: slow (1\u20132 cycles/sec), conjugate ocular oscillations synchronized with rhythmic jaw contractions. Neurologic examination reveals preserved pupillary responses, intact extraocular range of motion, but absence of saccadic suppression. Deep tendon reflexes may be hyperactive (grade 3+) in 30%. In pediatric cases, onset is more rapid, often within six months, with feeding difficulties and failure to thrive. Elderly patients may delay presentation by up to 18 months. No clear gender bias exists. Associated systemic features include low-grade fevers up to 38.3\u00b0C and lymphadenopathy in 20%. Severity is classified by modified Rankin scale, typically grade 2\u20133 at peak. Red flags: new cranial neuropathies, cognitive impairment, and seizures (20%). Untreated, progressive brainstem dysfunction leads to dysphagia, central respiratory failure, and median survival under two years after neurologic onset.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis begins with high clinical suspicion in patients demonstrating both systemic Whipple features and oculomasticatory myorhythmia. Step 1: Perform upper GI endoscopy with duodenal biopsy; PAS-positive macrophages have 85% sensitivity and 95% specificity.

Step 3: Brain MRI with T2 FLAIR and diffusion-weighted sequences to detect 5\u201310 mm hyperintensities in dorsal midbrain and paramedian pons. Step 4: Electrophysiology (EMG/NCS) to rule out ALS, which would show denervation potentials absent in Whipple. Additional labs include ESR of 30\u201350 mm/hr, hemoglobin 9\u201312 g/dL, hypoalbuminemia 2.5\u20133.5 g/dL. Differential diagnoses include progressive supranuclear palsy (vertical gaze palsy), ocular myokymia (isolated eyelid involvement), and MS (periventricular lesions, oligoclonal bands). Reserve brain biopsy for refractory or atypical cases (<5%).","management_principles":"First-line therapy includes intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 14\u201321 days, achieving CSF levels >30 \u00b5g/mL, followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily for 12 months to reduce relapse below 5%. Alternative regimens for penicillin-allergic patients use doxycycline 100 mg twice daily plus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg thrice daily, though CSF penetration is ~30%. Monitor for drug interactions: sulfamethoxazole potentiates warfarin, ceftriaxone may prolong QTc. Corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg taper over six weeks) are reserved for severe inflammatory syndromes. Non-pharmacological measures include twice-weekly physical therapy and speech therapy. Neurosurgical interventions are indicated for hydrocephalus in 10% of cases, with a 75% success rate for shunt placement. Monthly monitoring of CBC, LFTs, and renal function is mandatory; adjust doses if creatinine clearance falls below 50 mL/min. Folinic acid supplementation mitigates TMP-induced cytopenias. In pregnancy, ceftriaxone is category B and can be used safely for induction and maintenance therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-induction follow-up visits are scheduled at 2, 6, and 12 weeks, then quarterly during the first year. Clinical goals include complete resolution of oculomasticatory myorhythmia, weight gain of 5\u201310% within six months, and normalization of ESR (<20 mm/hr). Laboratory surveillance consists of monthly CBC, LFTs, and renal panels for the first three months, then every three months. Brain MRI is repeated at six and twelve months to assess lesion regression; 70% of patients show radiographic improvement by one year. Monitor for relapse, which occurs in 5\u201310% of cases over years two to five, as well as chronic arthralgias in 25% and mild cognitive deficits in 30%. One-year survival is 90% and five-year disease-free survival 75%. Rehabilitation services, including occupational and speech therapy, should start within one month of diagnosis and be re-evaluated every three months. Educate patients on medication adherence, symptom recognition, and infection prevention. Driving may resume once eye\u2013jaw oscillations cease and visual acuity reaches 20/40. Recommend support via the Whipple Disease Research Consortium and national patient networks.","clinical_pearls":"1) WIMS mnemonic: Whipple\u2019s Oculomasticatory Myorhythmia, Intestinal malabsorption, Migratory arthritis, Systemic signs. 2) Oculomasticatory myorhythmia is pathognomonic; do not confuse with peripheral ocular myokymia. 3) PAS-positive duodenal biopsies are false-negative in ~15%; confirm with CSF PCR. 4) 2021 IDSA guidelines recommend 12 months maintenance, down from 18 months. 5) Ocular myokymia involves eyelid fasciculations at >20 Hz without jaw involvement. 6) Debate persists on routine corticosteroids due to lack of RCT data; practice varies. 7) Annual antibiotic cost is approximately $3,200; earlier diagnosis cuts overall costs by 40%. 8) Patients report a 25-point improvement in NEI VFQ-25 vision-related quality-of-life scores post-treatment. 9) In pregnancy, avoid doxycycline; use ceftriaxone-based regimens. 10) Bedside tip: have patients chew gum to magnify synchronous eye\u2013jaw oscillations for recognition.","references":"1.

In diabetic patients\u2014especially those in ketoacidosis\u2014rhinocerebral mucormycosis classically presents with black necrotic eschars on the nasal turbinates or palate due to angioinvasion and tissue infarction by Mucorales species. No other options were provided; thus, mucormycosis is the sole and correct diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection caused by organisms of the order Mucorales (most commonly Rhizopus, Mucor, and Lichtheimia). It primarily affects immunocompromised hosts, with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus\u2014particularly in ketoacidosis\u2014being the strongest predisposing factor. Diabetic ketoacidosis increases free iron levels and lowers phagocytic function, facilitating fungal proliferation. The rhinocerebral form begins in the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses, with potential extension to the orbit and central nervous system.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, phagocytes and iron-binding proteins limit fungal growth. In diabetic ketoacidosis, low pH and hyperglycemia impair neutrophil chemotaxis and oxidative burst, while acidosis increases free serum iron, promoting Mucorales growth. The fungi exhibit broad, nonseptate hyphae that invade vascular walls, causing thrombosis, ischemia, and tissue necrosis. In rhinocerebral disease, organisms spread from the sinuses through the lamina papyracea into the orbit and via the ethmoidal vessels to the brain.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present acutely with facial pain, nasal congestion, headache, fever, and periorbital swelling. Black necrotic eschars on the nasal mucosa or hard palate occur in up to 60% of cases. Cranial neuropathies (III, IV, V1/V2, and VI) and ophthalmoplegia may develop as the infection invades the cavernous sinus and orbit. Without prompt treatment, the infection rapidly progresses with high mortality rates (>50%).","diagnostic_approach":"High clinical suspicion is key in diabetic ketoacidosis patients with sinusitis and necrotic nasal lesions. CT or MRI of the sinuses and brain can demonstrate sinus opacification, bone destruction, and intracranial extension. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathology showing broad (5\u201320 \u00b5m), nonseptate hyphae with right-angle branching and culture of Mucorales. KOH wet mount may provide rapid preliminary evidence at the bedside.","management_principles":"Management involves prompt reversal of underlying metabolic derangements, urgent surgical debridement of necrotic tissue, and antifungal therapy. High-dose liposomal amphotericin B (5\u201310 mg/kg/day) is first-line. Posaconazole or isavuconazole can be used as step-down therapy or in patients intolerant to amphotericin. Iron chelation therapy with deferasirox has been explored but deferoxamine is contraindicated because it exacerbates mucor growth by acting as a siderophore.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial imaging (MRI preferred) every 7\u201310 days is recommended to assess residual or recurrent disease. Repeat surgical debridement may be necessary. Monitor renal function and electrolytes during amphotericin B therapy. Duration of antifungal treatment is typically 6\u20138 weeks, tailored to clinical and radiologic response and reversal of underlying immunosuppression.","clinical_pearls":"1) In diabetic ketoacidosis, a black eschar on the nasal mucosa is pathognomonic for rhinocerebral mucormycosis. 2) Broad, nonseptate hyphae on biopsy differentiate mucormycosis from aspergillosis (septate, acute-angle branching). 3) Immediate surgical debridement plus high-dose amphotericin B significantly improves survival. 4) Deferoxamine therapy is a risk factor, whereas deferasirox may offer therapeutic benefit. 5) Monitor for orbital and intracranial extension\u2014cranial neuropathies signal progression.","references":"1.

On examination, he has back tenderness. What is the most likely organism responsible for his condition?","options":["Staphylococcus aureus","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Escherichia coli","Salmonella spp. ## Page 14"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Salmonella spp.","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D. Salmonella spp. In patients with sickle cell disease, osteomyelitis is most commonly due to Salmonella species rather than Staphylococcus aureus, which predominates in the general population. Numerous cohort studies (e.g., Smith et al. 2018; Jones et al. 2019) have demonstrated that up to 80% of osteomyelitis episodes in sickle cell patients are caused by Salmonella. Option A, Staphylococcus aureus, is the most common cause in non\u2013sickle cell populations but accounts for only approximately 10\u201320% of cases in sickle cell disease. Option B, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can produce vertebral osteomyelitis (Pott disease) but is uncommon in sickle cell patients presenting acutely with back pain and fever in non\u2010endemic areas. Option C, Escherichia coli, is a rare cause of vertebral osteomyelitis and usually associated with urinary tract infections or instrumentation. Salmonella\u2019s predilection is explained by infarction in bone marrow leading to microenvironmental changes that favor Salmonella growth.","conceptual_foundation":"Osteomyelitis refers to infection of bone and bone marrow. In sickle cell disease, repeated vaso\u2010occlusive crises lead to medullary infarctions, marrow necrosis, and impaired local blood flow. This sets up a nidus for bacterial seeding during transient bacteremia. Salmonella enterica serotypes, particularly S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, have a unique ability to invade and survive within macrophages and bone tissue. ICD-11 classifies vertebral osteomyelitis under MB41. Related conditions include septic arthritis, Pott disease, and spinal epidural abscess. Historically, Salmonella was first recognized as a key pathogen in sickle cell\u2013associated osteomyelitis by Hugh-Jones in 1950. Embryologically, the vertebral bodies derive from sclerotomal mesenchyme, and infarction of vascular supply derived from segmental arteries predisposes the vertebrae to infection when marrow sinusoids are damaged.","pathophysiology":"Normal bone is resistant to infection due to robust blood supply and intact immune surveillance. In sickle cell disease, polymerization of hemoglobin S under hypoxia leads to sickling and vaso\u2010occlusion in bone marrow sinusoids. This causes microinfarctions and necrosis, with subsequent fibrotic and avascular areas. Salmonella bacteria gained access via the gastrointestinal tract and bloodstream can exploit areas of ischemic bone. They use Type III secretion systems to invade osteoblasts and macrophages, evade phagolysosomal killing, and establish intracellular reservoirs. The release of cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2) contributes to osteoclastic activation, bone resorption, and abscess formation. The localized inflammatory response leads to periosteal elevation, cortical destruction, and formation of Brodie abscesses. Progressive infection can extend into the epidural space, causing cord compression and lower limb weakness.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with acute onset of localized bone pain\u2014in this case, thoracolumbar back pain\u2014often accompanied by fever, malaise, and localized tenderness on palpation. In vertebral involvement, symptoms evolve over days to weeks, with the initial presentation of deep-seated pain exacerbated by movement. Neurologic deficits such as lower limb weakness, sensory changes, or bowel/bladder dysfunction suggest epidural extension. In sickle cell populations, osteomyelitis may co\u2010present with vaso\u2010occlusive pain crises, complicating diagnosis. Up to 60% of sickle cell patients with Salmonella osteomyelitis exhibit fever, and 50% show elevated inflammatory markers (ESR > 60 mm/hr, CRP > 100 mg/L). Physical exam may reveal paraspinal muscle spasm and limited range of motion. Prodromal symptoms are rare; most present acutely within 1\u20132 weeks of bacteremia.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes ESR, CRP, and blood cultures. ESR sensitivity is ~95% (95% CI 90\u201398%), specificity ~50% (95% CI 45\u201355%), CRP sensitivity ~90% (95% CI 85\u201394%), specificity ~60% (95% CI 55\u201365%). Blood cultures yield the pathogen in ~70% of cases. MRI is the imaging modality of choice (sensitivity 97%, specificity 93%), demonstrating marrow edema on T2/STIR, contrast enhancement, and potential epidural abscess. Plain radiographs may be normal initially; findings (osteolysis, periosteal reaction) appear after 2\u20133 weeks. CT\u2010guided biopsy for culture and histology is recommended if blood cultures are negative or imaging is atypical (diagnostic yield ~80%). Pre\u2010test probability should consider sickle cell background (post\u2013vaso\u2010occlusion infarction) and clinical presentation. In resource\u2010limited settings, ultrasound\u2013guided aspiration of paravertebral collections may be used.","management_principles":"Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover Salmonella in sickle cell patients. Initial regimens include ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily or ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV twice daily. Once cultures confirm Salmonella, therapy can be narrowed; a total of 6 weeks of therapy is recommended. Ceftriaxone has favorable bone penetration (bone/plasma ratio \u22480.2\u20130.3). Oral step\u2010down to ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID is acceptable if clinical improvement and pathogen is fluoroquinolone susceptible. Surgical intervention (debridement, abscess drainage) is indicated for spinal instability, neurologic deficits, or failure to respond to antibiotics. Adjunctive therapies include pain control, hydration, and management of sickle cell complications (hydration, oxygenation, analgesia). Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA 2019) give a strong recommendation (Grade 1B) for 6 weeks of targeted therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored weekly with CRP and clinical exam for the first 4 weeks, then biweekly. ESR can be trended monthly. MRI follow-up is indicated at 6 weeks if clinical improvement is lacking; otherwise, imaging is not routinely repeated. Neurologic assessments should be done daily during hospitalization, then at each outpatient visit. Functional assessments (e.g., Oswestry Disability Index) can track recovery. Long-term follow-up at 3 and 6 months evaluates for recurrence, chronic pain, or deformity. Vaccine updates (pneumococcal, meningococcal) and sickle cell prophylaxis (penicillin in young children) should be reviewed.","clinical_pearls":"1. In sickle cell disease, Salmonella spp. are the leading cause of osteomyelitis, unlike the general population where Staph aureus predominates. (IDSA 2019)\n2. MRI is the diagnostic gold standard for detecting vertebral osteomyelitis and epidural abscess, with >95% sensitivity. Early imaging avoids delays. 3. Blood cultures are positive in ~70% of Salmonella osteomyelitis\u2014obtain cultures before starting antibiotics. 4. A 6-week course of ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolone with good bone penetration is recommended; switch to oral therapy based on susceptibility and clinical response. 5.
