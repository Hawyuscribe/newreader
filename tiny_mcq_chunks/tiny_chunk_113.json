Aspirin. For minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS \u22643), guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018) recommend immediate aspirin 160\u2013325 mg. Thrombolysis is not indicated unless deficits are disabling. Warfarin and Factor X inhibitors are reserved for cardioembolic stroke (e.g., atrial fibrillation) and have no role in non\u2010cardioembolic minor stroke.

What is the next step in workup?","options":["NCS with RNS","EEG","MRI Brain","Urine toxicology"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"MRI Brain","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Nerve conduction studies with repetitive nerve stimulation (NCS-RNS) target neuromuscular junction disorders such as myasthenia gravis, where a decremental response >10% on low\u2010frequency stimulation has 83% sensitivity for ocular MG. In an intubated patient with preserved consciousness and only extraocular movements intact, NCS\u2010RNS is low yield because it cannot localize central pontine lesions or assess corticospinal tract integrity. Rarely, botulism may show facilitation on high\u2010frequency RNS, but autonomic features and descending paralysis predominate in that context. Option B: Electroencephalography (EEG) identifies epileptiform discharges and nonconvulsive status epilepticus with sensitivity of 87%. It is indicated in unexplained coma or fluctuating consciousness. However, intact awareness and normal pupillary reflexes strongly favor a locked\u2010in state over seizure activity, making EEG next step suboptimal. Misconceptions arise when clinicians equate immobility with seizure. Option C: MRI Brain is definitive. Diffusion\u2010weighted imaging (DWI) detects pontine infarcts within six hours with >90% sensitivity (AAN 2022). Lesions in the ventral pons disrupt corticospinal and corticobulbar fibers but spare vertical gaze centers in the dorsal tegmentum, explaining preserved extraocular movements. MRI also detects hemorrhage, demyelination, or tumor in the same region. Option D: Urine toxicology screens have variable sensitivity (60\u201390%) for common toxins. While useful in altered mental status of unknown etiology, a negative screen cannot exclude central lesions and may delay critical imaging. Choosing D often reflects a bias toward reversible metabolic causes despite pathognomonic eye\u2010movement sparing in locked\u2010in syndrome.","conceptual_foundation":"Locked\u2010in syndrome localizes to the ventral pontine basis, where corticospinal fibers descend adjacent to the abducens nucleus (CN VI) and corticobulbar tracts originate. The pons arises embryologically from the metencephalon; segmental organization dictates cranial nerve nuclei alignment and vascular supply by the basilar artery. Intact vertical gaze is mediated by the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the dorsal midbrain, which remains unaffected by ventral pontine lesions. Normal physiology conveys motor commands from the primary motor cortex through the internal capsule into cerebral peduncles, then decussates in the pyramids before synapsing in the ventral horn. Millard\u2013Gubler and Foville syndromes highlight pontine fascicular lesions that produce facial palsy or ipsilateral abducens deficits, respectively, contrasting with midline lesions creating complete quadriplegia. Jean\u2010Martin Charcot first described the clinical phenomenon in the 19th century; later autopsy studies by Fisher correlated ventral pontine infarction with preserved consciousness. Key MRI landmarks include the facial colliculus on axial FLAIR, the pontine raphe line, and the basilar sulcus, which guide precise localization and management decisions.","pathophysiology":"Acute ventral pontine infarction triggers an excitotoxic cascade: ischemia impairs Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase, causing depolarization and massive glutamate release. Glutamate activates NMDA and AMPA receptors, leading to Ca\u00b2\u207a overload, activation of calpains, and mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP), culminating in apoptosis and necrosis. ATP depletion forces reliance on anaerobic glycolysis, creating lactic acidosis and further ion pump failure. In hemorrhagic conversion, thrombin and iron catalyze reactive oxygen species, activating microglia and astrocytes to release IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and MMP-9, disrupting the blood\u2013brain barrier. Genetic variants like MTHFR C677T (relative risk 1.4) impair homocysteine metabolism, predisposing to small\u2010vessel pontine strokes. High mitochondrial density in brainstem neurons makes them vulnerable; irreversible injury occurs after five minutes of complete ischemia, with cytotoxic edema peaking by 24\u201348 hours. Limited collateral flow from anterior inferior cerebellar branches provides minimal protection. Over weeks, Wallerian degeneration of corticospinal tracts ensues, with reactive astrocytosis forming a glial scar that prevents axonal regrowth. Compensatory cortical plasticity is insufficient to restore lost motor pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present with acute quadriplegia and anarthria within minutes to hours of symptom onset; peak severity occurs by two hours. Despite complete motor paralysis (0/5 strength in all limbs) and bulbar involvement, consciousness is intact. Neurological exam reveals preserved vertical eye movements (via III/IV nuclei) and often horizontal gaze (via VI nucleus), normal pupillary reflexes (2\u20133 mm brisk bilaterally), and variable facial muscle function based on lesion extent. Sensory deficits may be absent or limited to proprioception. Elderly patients with hypertension (BP >180/100 mmHg in 60% of cases) and diabetes are at highest risk. Pediatric presentations are rare but mirror adult findings. No gender predominance is noted. Associated systemic signs include dysautonomia if adjacent reticular formation is involved. Severity is quantified by the NIH Stroke Scale; scores typically exceed 20. Red flags include eye movement sparing despite complete limb immobility. Without intervention, one-month mortality is 70% and long-term morbidity approaches 100%. Ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia occurs in 40% without early recognition and supportive care.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Obtain non-contrast head CT immediately (sensitivity 90% for hemorrhage) to exclude bleeding per AAN 2023 guidelines.

Step 5: NCS-RNS is second-line when MG is in differential (per AAN 2023), demonstrating 83% sensitivity. Step 6: EEG to exclude nonconvulsive status epilepticus if clinical fluctuations occur (sensitivity 87%) per ILAE 2021 criteria.

In acute ischemic stroke, the immediate cellular response to energy failure is cytotoxic edema or cellular swelling, owing to rapid sodium and calcium influx secondary to Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase pump failure. This occurs within minutes of arterial occlusion (Astrup et al. 1981; Pulsinelli et al. 1982). Option B, demyelination, is a later event associated with oligodendrocyte death and axonal loss that develops days to weeks after the initial insult and is not the first cellular change. Misconceptions often arise from confusing white matter injury with the earliest neuronal responses; however, demyelination requires preceding cytotoxic and inflammatory processes.","conceptual_foundation":"Ischemic stroke results from an abrupt interruption of cerebral blood flow, leading to deprivation of oxygen and glucose. Core concepts include cerebral energy metabolism, ion homeostasis, and membrane integrity. Under normal physiology, neurons generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation and maintain intracellular-extracellular ion gradients through ATP-dependent pumps. ICD-11 classifies ischemic stroke under code 8B11.Z. Differential diagnoses include transient ischemic attack (TIA), intracerebral hemorrhage, and hypoglycemia. The concept of the ischemic penumbra, introduced by Astrup et al. in 1981, describes salvageable tissue surrounding the irreversibly damaged core. Embryologically, the cerebral vasculature arises from mesodermal angioblasts and neural crest\u2013derived pericytes, establishing the arterial supply via internal carotid and vertebrobasilar systems.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuronal function depends on ATP-driven Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase pumps that maintain low intracellular Na\u207a and high K\u207a, preserving osmotic balance. In ischemia, ATP production halts, pump failure ensues, and Na\u207a and Ca\u00b2\u207a enter cells while K\u207a exits. Water follows sodium osmotically, causing cytotoxic edema (cellular swelling) within minutes. Intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a overload activates destructive enzymes (proteases, phospholipases, endonucleases), damaging membranes and cytoskeleton. This early cell swelling differentiates from vasogenic edema, which arises hours later due to blood\u2013brain barrier disruption and extracellular fluid accumulation. Demyelination stems from subsequent oligodendrocyte necrosis and macrophage-mediated myelin stripping, not immediate energy failure.","clinical_manifestation":"Cytotoxic edema underlies the acute neurological deficits of ischemic stroke. Patients present with sudden focal signs\u2014hemiparesis, aphasia, visual field cuts\u2014corresponding to regions of early cellular swelling. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) detects restricted diffusion within minutes, reflecting cytotoxic edema with >90% sensitivity and specificity (Warach et al. 1999). CT signs of early ischemia, such as loss of gray-white differentiation and sulcal effacement, become apparent within the first hours. Demyelination does not contribute to acute presentation but may produce subacute leukoencephalopathic changes.","diagnostic_approach":"Acute stroke evaluation begins with non-contrast CT to exclude hemorrhage; early ischemic changes (cytotoxic edema) include effacement of sulci and the insular ribbon sign. DWI MRI within minutes to hours confirms cytotoxic edema. Perfusion imaging identifies the ischemic penumbra. CT angiography and MR angiography assess vessel occlusion. No acute test diagnoses demyelination; that is evaluated chronically via MRI T2/FLAIR sequences.","management_principles":"Hyperacute management focuses on rapid reperfusion to limit cytotoxic edema. Intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours (Class I, Level A, AHA/ASA 2018) and mechanical thrombectomy up to 24 hours in selected patients (Class I, Level A, AHA/ASA 2018) reduce infarct size. Neuroprotective agents targeting excitotoxic injury have not proven clinically effective (Fisher et al. 2009). There are no acute treatments to prevent demyelination, which occurs later.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for malignant cerebral edema in large infarcts during the first 72 hours (Class IIa, Level B, AHA/ASA 2018); consider decompressive hemicraniectomy if indicated. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure control, and diabetes management. Serial imaging assesses infarct evolution and rules out hemorrhagic transformation. Demyelination is not a focus in post-ischemic follow-up.","clinical_pearls":"1. Cytotoxic edema is the earliest event in ischemic stroke, visible as diffusion restriction on MRI within minutes. 2. Differentiate cytotoxic (intracellular) from vasogenic (extracellular) edema clinically and radiographically. 3. \"Time is brain\"\u2014each minute of delay costs millions of neurons; rapid reperfusion limits cellular swelling. 4.

DAPT. In patients presenting with a minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS \u22643) within the 4.5-hour window and non-disabling symptoms, dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 21 days has been shown in the CHANCE and POINT trials to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke compared to aspirin alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.53\u20130.88; JAMA 2013; POINT HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59\u20130.95). Option B (TPA) is reserved for patients with disabling deficits; in minor, non-disabling strokes the risk of hemorrhage may outweigh benefit (AHA/ASA 2018 guideline class IIb recommendation). Option C (thrombectomy) is indicated only for large vessel occlusions with NIHSS \u22656\u20138 and proximal anterior circulation occlusion (AHA/ASA 2018 class I). A non-disabling NIHSS 3 without evidence of large vessel occlusion does not meet thrombectomy criteria, and tPA would not be indicated absent disabling symptoms, making DAPT the appropriate next step.","conceptual_foundation":"Minor ischemic stroke is defined as NIHSS \u22643 with non-disabling deficits. The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) quantifies neurologic impairment and helps guide acute management and prognosis (ICD-11 8A60.0). Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was evaluated in two large, randomized controlled trials: CHANCE in a Chinese population (clopidogrel plus aspirin vs aspirin alone; recurrent stroke at 90 days 8.2% vs 11.7%, p=0.006) and POINT in a North American/European cohort (5.0% vs 6.5%, p=0.02). These findings led to the AHA/ASA 2018 update recommending DAPT for 21 days in minor non-cardioembolic strokes (class I, level A). Differential considerations include TIA (resolution within 24 hours), non-disabling vs disabling deficits, and large vessel occlusion. Historically, single-antiplatelet therapy was standard, but the POINT trial (2018) shifted practice to early DAPT. Embryologically, platelets derive from megakaryocytes; pathophysiology links platelet activation to atherothrombosis. The middle cerebral artery is the most common site of small thromboembolic stroke. Clopidogrel\u2019s active metabolite irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 receptor, reducing aggregation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, endothelial cells maintain antithrombotic homeostasis via nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and thrombomodulin, while platelets circulating in blood remain quiescent. In ischemic stroke, rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque or embolization from a proximal source leads to platelet adhesion via von Willebrand factor to subendothelial collagen, activation of GPIIb/IIIa receptors, and thrombus formation. In minor stroke without large vessel occlusion, microthrombi obstruct small penetrating arteries leading to focal neurologic deficits. Dual antiplatelet therapy targets two separate pathways: aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1, reducing thromboxane A2, while clopidogrel blocks the P2Y12 ADP receptor, preventing amplification of platelet aggregation. This combined blockade reduces recurrent thrombus formation more effectively than monotherapy but carries a small increased risk of bleeding (POINT trial major hemorrhage 0.9% vs 0.4%). The temporally limited 21-day course takes advantage of the high recurrence risk period post-stroke, then de-escalates to single antiplatelet therapy to minimize hemorrhagic complications.","clinical_manifestation":"Minor ischemic stroke typically presents with mild hemiparesis, numbness, dysarthria, or sensory changes corresponding to small cortical or subcortical infarcts. Cardinal features include unilateral weakness (65%), sensory disturbance (50%), and speech impairment (25%). Non-disabling symptoms allow for ambulatory independence and absence of significant functional impairment (modified Rankin Scale \u22641). Variants include lacunar syndromes such as pure motor or sensory stroke (capsular regions supplied by lenticulostriate arteries). Demographically, minor strokes affect older adults (>65 years), with hypertension and diabetes as common comorbidities. Without treatment, the 90-day recurrence risk is 10\u201315%, with most recurrences within the first 2 weeks. Diagnostic criteria per AHA/ASA include acute neurologic deficit lasting >24 hours, imaging\u2010confirmed infarction, and NIHSS \u22643 for minor stroke classification. In special populations, such as patients on anticoagulation, presentation may be similar but management differs. Pregnancy and immunocompromised status do not alter initial clinical features but affect treatment choices.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier evaluation involves noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%), blood glucose, CBC, coagulation studies, and ECG to assess for atrial fibrillation. CT angiography may be reserved if large vessel occlusion is suspected but is not routinely indicated in minor, non-disabling strokes. MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging (DWI) has near-perfect sensitivity (97%) and specificity (94%) for acute infarction but may not change acute management. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and carotid duplex assess for proximal stenosis if the clinical syndrome suggests territorial involvement. Pretest probability for large vessel occlusion in NIHSS \u22643 is <5%, rendering extensive angiography low yield. Second\u2010tier tests include echocardiography (TEE sensitivity for PFO 90%), Holter monitoring for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (detection rate 5\u201315% over 30 days). Third\u2010tier diagnostics, such as hypercoagulable panels, are indicated in young stroke patients without clear etiology. Guidelines recommend carotid imaging in anterior circulation events (AHA/ASA class I), and echocardiography in cryptogenic strokes (class IIa).","management_principles":"Initial management of minor non-disabling ischemic stroke includes blood pressure optimization (target <180/105 mmHg before antiplatelet initiation), glycemic control, and hydration. For antithrombotic therapy, the AHA/ASA 2018 guideline endorses DAPT (aspirin 75\u2013100 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily) for 21 days (class I, level A), based on CHANCE and POINT trials; thereafter, switch to monotherapy. Aspirin monotherapy remains the option if DAPT contraindications exist. Thrombolysis with tPA (0.9 mg/kg) is reserved for disabling strokes (class I for NIHSS >4 or disabling deficits). Thrombectomy is indicated for large vessel occlusion with NIHSS \u22656 within 6 hours (class I). Risk factor modification includes statin therapy (high\u2010intensity), antihypertensives, and lifestyle changes. Special populations: in pregnancy, low\u2010dose aspirin is preferred; clopidogrel is category B. In renal impairment, no dose adjustments for aspirin/clopidogrel are needed. Monitor for bleeding; platelet function testing may guide therapy in poor metabolizers of clopidogrel.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up within 24\u201348 hours includes neurologic exam and repeat imaging only if clinical change occurs. Secondary prevention clinic referral within 7\u201314 days is recommended for comprehensive risk factor management. Laboratory monitoring for complete blood count and liver function tests is not routinely required for DAPT but is prudent if bleeding occurs. Lipid panel should be checked within 24 hours and at 4\u20136 weeks to assess statin efficacy. Ambulatory cardiac monitoring for atrial fibrillation over 30 days reduces undetected AF by 5\u201315% and should be considered in cryptogenic cases (AHA/ASA class IIa). Carotid duplex follow-up depends on initial stenosis severity: annual if <50%, revascularization if \u226570%. Long-term aspirin monotherapy continues indefinitely; clopidogrel is stopped after 21 days. Rehabilitation focuses on gait training and occupational therapy to optimize function. Patient education on stroke warning signs and adherence is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1.

FFP. In warfarin\u2010related intracerebral hemorrhage with an elevated INR (e.g., INR of 3), immediate reversal of anticoagulation is required to limit hematoma expansion. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) provides all vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and can reduce INR within 30\u201360 minutes. Although prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is preferred if available (Class I recommendation, Level of Evidence A), among the given options, FFP is the best. Option A (Vitamin K) alone has a delayed onset (6\u201324 hours for full effect) and is insufficient for immediate hemostasis. Option C (Protamine sulfate) reverses heparin, not warfarin, and thus is ineffective here.","conceptual_foundation":"Warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, reducing synthesis of vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factors. An intracerebral hemorrhage in anticoagulated patients carries high risk of expansion and poor outcome. The goal of reversal is to restore clotting factor levels rapidly to achieve hemostasis. FFP contains all clotting factors and complements vitamin K administration for sustained reversal. Nosologically, warfarin\u2010associated hemorrhage is coded under I61 (ICD\u201011) as nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage with anticoagulant involvement.","pathophysiology":"Normally, the coagulation cascade depends on vitamin K\u2013dependent \u03b3\u2010carboxylation of clotting factors. Warfarin impairs this process, prolonging prothrombin time/INR. In intracerebral hemorrhage, anticoagulation exacerbates bleeding by preventing adequate clot formation. FFP infuses functional clotting factors, restoring thrombin generation, fibrin formation, and hemostatic plug assembly within minutes to hours.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with acute focal neurologic deficits corresponding to hemorrhage location, headache, nausea, and decreased consciousness. In warfarin\u2010associated ICH, deficits often worsen rapidly due to ongoing bleeding. Examination may reveal hemiparesis, aphasia, or cranial nerve findings depending on site. Early radiographic assessment shows hematoma volume, intraventricular extension, and midline shift.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes noncontrast head CT to confirm ICH and measure volume. Laboratory tests include PT/INR, aPTT, CBC, and type and cross\u2010match. In patients on warfarin, INR guides reversal strategy. Pretest probability of warfarin\u2010associated hematoma is high when INR >2 and history of anticoagulation. FFP administration requires ABO\u2010compatible thawed units and infusion of 10\u201315 mL/kg to raise factor levels.","management_principles":"Immediate management involves airway protection, blood pressure control (target SBP <140 mm Hg per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines), and reversal of anticoagulation. FFP dosing: 15 mL/kg to increase factor levels by ~20\u201330%. Concurrent intravenous vitamin K (5\u201310 mg) promotes endogenous factor synthesis over hours. Protamine sulfate is not indicated. PCC (if available) would reverse INR more rapidly with lower volume, but is not listed.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor INR every 6 hours until <1.4. Repeat head CT at 6-12 hours to assess hematoma stability. Continue neurological checks hourly for first 24 hours, then every 2\u20134 hours. Once INR is normalized, maintain SBP <160 mm Hg. Resume anticoagulation only after weighing thromboembolic risk; if indicated, consider lower\u2010intensity regimens or left atrial appendage closure.","clinical_pearls":"1. FFP is the immediate reversal agent for warfarin\u2010associated hemorrhage when PCC is unavailable. 2. Vitamin K alone is too slow for acute ICH reversal. 3. Protamine sulfate works only for heparin. 4. Target INR <1.4 to reduce hematoma expansion. 5. Control blood pressure aggressively (SBP <140 mm Hg) to limit hematoma growth.","references":"1.
