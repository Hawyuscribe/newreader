[{"question_number":"1","question":"In a scenario of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, what can you see on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)?","options":["Empty Sella","Hydrocephalus","Cerebral edema","Tumor"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Empty Sella","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"In idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), MRI classically demonstrates an empty sella turcica due to increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure flattening the pituitary gland. This finding is reported in up to 70% of patients with IIH (Friedman et al. 2013). By contrast, hydrocephalus (B) indicates ventricular enlargement from CSF outflow obstruction, not a feature of IIH. Cerebral edema (C) suggests diffuse brain swelling from metabolic or vascular causes, absent in IIH. A tumor (D) would represent a secondary cause of raised intracranial pressure, which must be excluded before diagnosing IIH. Current AAN guidelines (2013) list empty sella as a major MRI sign supportive of IIH (Level B evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"IIH is defined by elevated intracranial pressure with normal brain parenchyma and CSF composition. In ICD-11, IIH falls under \u2018Benign intracranial hypertension\u2019 (8B70). It predominantly affects obese women of childbearing age. Differential diagnoses include cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, mass lesions, and secondary intracranial hypertension due to medications or systemic disorders. Historically termed 'benign' pseudo-tumor cerebri, recognition of its potential for vision loss led to renaming as IIH. Embryologically, the pituitary resides in the sella turcica, and CSF pulsations under chronically elevated pressure can reshape this bony fossa. Anatomically, the pituitary fossa communicates with the subarachnoid space around the optic nerves, explaining both empty sella and papilledema. Genetic and molecular studies implicate impaired CSF absorption at arachnoid granulations and dysregulation of 11\u03b2-HSD1 in choroid plexus epithelium, though no single gene has been definitively linked.","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF dynamics involve production by the choroid plexus (~0.35 mL/min) and absorption via arachnoid villi. In IIH, either increased CSF production or decreased absorption elevates intracranial pressure (>25 cm H\u2082O). This pressure transmits along perioptic subarachnoid spaces, causing papilledema. Chronically, high CSF pressure flattens the pituitary gland, producing MRI empty sella. Cellularly, elevated pressure may activate stretch-sensitive ion channels and inflammatory cascades, contributing to headache. Compensatory skull remodeling is minimal in adults, so signs relate to CSF redistribution. Compared to cerebral edema, where ionic pump failure causes intracellular swelling, IIH involves purely extra-axial CSF disturbances. Unlike hydrocephalus, ventricular size remains normal or small in IIH due to uniform pressure distribution.","clinical_manifestation":"IIH presents with daily, diffuse headache aggravated by Valsalva, transient visual obscurations (up to 68%), pulsatile tinnitus (60%), and diplopia from VI nerve palsy (10\u201330%). Papilledema is nearly universal at presentation. Visual field defects\u2014particularly enlarged blind spot\u2014occur in 90% of cases. Rarely, the condition progresses to severe vision loss if untreated. Onset is insidious; attacks may wax and wane over weeks. Pediatric presentations may lack headache and manifest with cranial nerve palsies alone.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis follows modified Dandy criteria: symptoms/signs of raised ICP; no localizing signs except abducens palsy; normal neuroimaging except signs of elevated pressure (empty sella, distended optic nerve sheaths); elevated lumbar puncture (LP) opening pressure >25 cm H\u2082O; normal CSF composition. First-tier workup: brain MRI with MR venography to exclude sinus thrombosis. LP is performed only after imaging. Sensitivity of empty sella for IIH is ~70% (CI 60\u201380%); optic nerve sheath dilation has sensitivity 80%, specificity 90%. Second-tier: OCT quantifies RNFL thickness for papilledema monitoring. Third-tier: ICP monitoring in refractory cases.","management_principles":"Weight loss (\u22655% body weight) is first-line; each 6-kg loss reduces LP pressure by ~18 cm H\u2082O. Acetazolamide (1\u20132 g/day) inhibits carbonic anhydrase in choroid plexus, lowering CSF production by ~50%, with improvement in visual field mean deviation by 1.3 dB at 6 months (ICER 7 mm Hg; IIH Treatment Trial). Topiramate (50\u2013100 mg/day) serves as headache prophylaxis and lowers weight. In refractory vision-threatening cases, optic nerve sheath fenestration or ventriculoperitoneal shunting is indicated (Class II evidence). Transverse sinus stenting is experimental. Regular monitoring for acetazolamide adverse effects (paresthesias, metabolic acidosis) is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes ophthalmologic exams with visual fields and OCT every 3 months until stable, then every 6\u201312 months. Repeat LP pressure measurement if vision deteriorates. MRI/MRV repeated only if new symptoms suggest complications. Monitor renal function and electrolytes quarterly during acetazolamide therapy. Long-term prognosis is good with weight management; ~10% risk of permanent visual deficit.","clinical_pearls":"1. Empty sella on MRI is a sentinel sign of elevated ICP\u2014search for IIH. 2. Always perform neuroimaging before LP to exclude mass lesions. 3. Acetazolamide dose should be titrated to effect\u2014monitor serum bicarbonate. 4. Weight loss of \u22656 kg has quantifiable benefit in ICP reduction. 5. Optic nerve sheath fenestration is vision-saving in acute, severe cases.","references":"1. Friedman DI, Liu GT, Digre KB.

Which of the following conditions could be the cause?","options":["Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)","Optic neuritis","Both A and B","None of the above"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Optic neuritis","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. Optic neuritis. Optic neuritis typically presents with subacute, unilateral vision loss accompanied by periocular pain that worsens with eye movement. This pain results from inflammation of the optic nerve sheath and is a hallmark feature cited in multiple cohorts (Optic Neuritis Study Group, 1992). Leber\u2019s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is characterized by painless, subacute central vision loss without ocular pain (Yu-Wai-Man et al., 2016). Option A is incorrect because LHON is classically painless. Option C is incorrect because LHON does not cause eye pain. Option D is incorrect because optic neuritis reliably causes pain with eye movement.","conceptual_foundation":"Optic neuritis is an acute demyelinating inflammatory injury of the optic nerve. In the 2013 International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10 H46.0; ICD-11 8B60.0), it is categorized under inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. Differential diagnoses include ischemic optic neuropathy, compressive optic neuropathy, LHON, and neuromyelitis optica. The optic nerve derives from the diencephalon and is myelinated by oligodendrocytes. Demyelination slows conduction, produces relative afferent pupillary defect, and leads to color desaturation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows T2 hyperintensity and gadolinium enhancement of the nerve.","pathophysiology":"Normally, myelinated axons in the optic nerve conduct impulses rapidly. In optic neuritis, an autoimmune attack\u2014often associated with multiple sclerosis\u2014targets myelin basic protein, initiating complement-mediated oligodendrocyte injury. Inflammatory cells infiltrate the nerve sheath, causing edema and mechanical pain on eye movement due to stretching of the inflamed nerve. Demyelination leads to conduction block and slowed visual evoked potentials (VEPs), correlating with the severity of visual dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with painful, subacute (hours to days) monocular vision loss, typically over 1\u20132 weeks. Periocular pain is present in ~90% of cases and is exacerbated by eye movement. Visual acuity ranges from mild reduction to no light perception. Color vision is disproportionately affected. A relative afferent pupillary defect is seen in unilateral cases. Uhthoff\u2019s phenomenon (transient worsening with heat) and loss of contrast sensitivity are common. Bilateral cases suggest neuromyelitis optica or infectious etiologies.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line testing is contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbits, demonstrating optic nerve enhancement (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). Visual evoked potentials show delayed P100 latency (sensitivity ~80%). Lumbar puncture may reveal oligoclonal bands if multiple sclerosis is suspected (sensitivity ~85%). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can quantify retinal nerve fiber layer thinning over time. Differential includes ischemic optic neuropathy (older patients, no pain) and compressive lesions (gradual onset, imaging required).","management_principles":"The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (1992) demonstrated that high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3 days followed by an oral taper) accelerates visual recovery (hazard ratio for improvement at 6 months 1.7; 95% CI 1.2\u20132.3). Oral steroids alone increase recurrence risk and are not recommended. No treatment alters the long-term final visual outcome. Disease-modifying therapies (e.g., interferon-beta) should be considered if MRI reveals demyelinating lesions to reduce the risk of conversion to multiple sclerosis.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be re-evaluated at 1 month and 6 months post-treatment with repeat visual acuity, color vision testing, and OCT. Brain MRI should be repeated at 6\u201312 months if new neurologic symptoms arise. Annual neurologic exams are recommended for at least 5 years to monitor for multiple sclerosis development. Patient education regarding Uhthoff\u2019s phenomenon and signs of MS is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. Pain with eye movement is present in ~90% of optic neuritis cases\u2014absence suggests alternative diagnosis. 2. A relative afferent pupillary defect is pathognomonic in unilateral optic nerve dysfunction. 3. High-dose IV steroids speed recovery but do not improve long-term acuity. 4. MRI lesion burden predicts MS conversion risk\u2014\u22652 lesions \u2192 ~51% risk at 15 years. 5. OCT can monitor long-term axonal loss and correlate with visual prognosis.","references":"1.

ECG. In Leber\u2019s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), mitochondrial DNA mutations (e.g., m.11778G>A) primarily affect retinal ganglion cells but can also involve cardiac conduction tissue, predisposing to arrhythmias and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. An ECG is indicated to screen for conduction defects (Yu-Wai-Man et al., 2012). Renal ultrasound (Option B) is not indicated, as LHON does not cause renal structural abnormalities. Option C is incorrect because renal involvement is absent. Option D is incorrect because ECG screening is recommended in guidelines for mitochondrial optic neuropathies.","conceptual_foundation":"LHON is an inherited mitochondrial optic neuropathy classified under ICD-10 H47.2 and ICD-11 8B42.1. It is one of the primary mitochondrial diseases affecting complex I of the respiratory chain. Differential considerations include dominant optic atrophy (OPA1 mutations), multiple sclerosis\u2013associated optic neuritis, and toxic optic neuropathies. The mutation load (heteroplasmy) influences penetrance, and environmental factors (smoking, alcohol) modulate expression.","pathophysiology":"Point mutations in mitochondrial DNA impair complex I function, reducing ATP production and increasing reactive oxygen species. Retinal ganglion cells, with high energy demand, undergo apoptosis via mitochondrial permeability transition pores. Conduction system cells in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes are similarly vulnerable, leading to accessory pathway formation and arrhythmias detectable on ECG.","clinical_manifestation":"LHON presents in young males (mean age ~24) with painless, subacute central vision loss in one eye, followed weeks to months later by the fellow eye. Fundoscopy may show peripapillary telangiectatic microangiopathy and swelling of the retinal nerve fiber layer (pseudo-edema). Cardiac manifestations include Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern in ~10\u201320% of patients and conduction blocks. Systemic features (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, movement disorders) are less common.","diagnostic_approach":"Genetic testing for primary LHON mutations confirms diagnosis (sensitivity >95%). Once diagnosed, baseline ECG is recommended to detect pre-excitation or conduction defects (AAN practice parameter). No role for renal imaging exists. Serial ECGs may be needed in symptomatic patients or those with accessory pathways.","management_principles":"There is no proven therapy to reverse vision loss in LHON, though idebenone has shown modest benefit in clinical trials (RHODOS study, Carelli et al., 2019). Cardiac conduction abnormalities may require electrophysiology referral, antiarrhythmic therapy, or ablation for WPW. Avoidance of mitochondrial toxins and smoking cessation are advised.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual ophthalmologic evaluation with visual acuity, OCT, and visual fields. Cardiology follow-up with ECG at baseline and every 1\u20132 years, or sooner if symptomatic palpitations or syncope occur.
