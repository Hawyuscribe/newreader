[{"question_number":"4","question":"A young patient with multiple new acute strokes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a history of sensorineural hearing loss. What condition is suspected?","options":["Susac syndrome","Antiphospholipid syndrome"],"subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2023","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Susac syndrome","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Susac syndrome): Susac syndrome is characterized by the triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss. In young adults (mean age 28 years, range 9\u201358), acute onset of multiple small ischemic strokes on MRI, corpus callosum \u201csnowball\u201d lesions in 75% of cases, and bilateral low-frequency hearing loss on audiometry (>60% of patients) strongly point to Susac. Pathophysiologically, microangiopathic endotheliopathy leads to immune\u2010mediated occlusion of precapillary arterioles in brain, retina, and cochlea. Misconceptions arise when hearing loss is attributed to vasculitis alone, but only Susac matches the triad with specific corpus callosum involvement. Option B (Antiphospholipid syndrome): APS causes hypercoagulability with infarcts and livedo reticularis. However, sensorineural hearing loss is rare (<5%) and corpus callosum lesions are uncommon. A history of recurrent fetal loss and anticardiolipin antibodies (>40 GPL units) would be typical. Option C (MELAS): Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke\u2010like episodes manifest before age 40 with elevated lactate >2.5 mmol/L. Hearing loss can occur but MRI shows cortical ribboning, not periventricular snowballs. Option D (CADASIL): Causes subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. Presents in mid\u2010adulthood with migraine, depression, and NOT sensorineural hearing loss. NOT retina findings. Snowball corpus callosum lesions and hearing loss definitively exclude CADASIL. Studies: Susac natural history study (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2016) reported 96% triad concordance. International Susac registry guidelines (2017) support early immunotherapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Susac syndrome involves microvascular territories supplying the central corpus callosum, inner retina, and cochlea. Anatomically, arterioles branching from the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries penetrate the corpus callosum, with predilection for the central fibers, producing characteristic \u2018snowball\u2019 lesions on T2 MRI. Retinal branch arteries arise from the central retinal artery, while cochlear microvasculature derives from the labyrinthine artery. Embryologically, these small vessels develop from mesenchymal angioblasts in the yolk sac around week 5, with blood\u2010brain and blood\u2010retina barrier formation by astrocyte foot processes by week 20. Normal physiology requires endothelial integrity, preserved by CD31 and tight junction proteins (claudin\u20105, occludin). In Susac, endothelial injury leads to capillary nonperfusion. Related conditions include lupus vasculitis, Sj\u00f6gren microangiopathy, and Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, but none show the triad. Historically first described by John O. Susac in 1979, understanding evolved with the advent of high\u2010resolution MRI in the 1990s, clarifying corpus callosum lesion morphology. Key landmarks: central corpus callosum body, retinal arterial arcades, and cochlear basal turn. These regions\u2019 clinical significance lies in correlating focal deficits with specific vascular occlusions, guiding targeted immunosuppression.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, Susac syndrome is mediated by CD8+ T\u2010cell\u2010driven endotheliopathy. Endothelial cells in precapillary arterioles express surface antigens recognized by autoreactive T cells, releasing perforin and granzyme B, inducing apoptosis. Complement components C3a and C5a amplify local inflammation, recruiting macrophages and neutrophils. Release of tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha and interleukin\u20106 increases vascular permeability. Ion channel dysfunction involving endothelial calcium channels exacerbates barrier breakdown. Genetic predisposition includes HLA\u2010C*04 and HLA\u2010C*07 alleles in 30% of patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction in endothelial cells may lower ATP production by 40%, impairing Na+/K+\u2010ATPase and tight junction maintenance. Over weeks, vessel lumen narrowing leads to ischemic cascades: excitotoxic glutamate release, calcium influx in neurons, and caspase\u20103 activation. Initial occlusions provoked by immune complexes appear within days, while secondary demyelination and gliosis develop over 4\u20136 weeks. Compensatory collateral formation is limited in microvessels, failing to restore blood flow beyond 50% of baseline. Chronic low\u2010grade inflammation persists, promoting fibrosis in vessel walls. These cascades account for multifocal infarcts and progressive sensorineural deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset often occurs subacutely over 1\u20133 weeks with headache reported in 85% of Susac patients. Encephalopathic signs such as confusion, memory lapses, and ataxia peak around day 10\u201314. MRI reveals multiple T2 lesions in corpus callosum body in 90% of cases. Sensorineural hearing loss typically presents concurrently or within two months, with low\u2010frequency thresholds elevated >30 dB on audiometry. Visual symptoms from branch retinal artery occlusions include scotomas and transient vision loss in 65% of patients, with fluorescein angiography showing arteriolar wall hyper\u2010fluorescence in 70%. Neurological exam may reveal cognitive dysfunction (MMSE scores drop by 3\u20136 points), gait unsteadiness, and mild pyramidal signs in 25%. In pediatric cases (<18 years), encephalopathy dominates, whereas adults more often report visual complaints. No significant gender difference in presentation, though females constitute 60% of cases. Systemic manifestations like skin rash are rare (<10%). Severity scales such as the Susac Clinical Activity Score rate cognitive, visual, and auditory domains from 0 to 3. Red flags include rapid bilateral hearing decline and multifocal corpus callosum lesions. Without treatment, relapses occur in 80% within two years, leading to permanent deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on triad features. Step 2: Brain MRI with T2, FLAIR, diffusion\u2010weighted imaging. Sensitivity 95%, specificity 90% for corpus callosum snowball lesions. Step 3: Fluorescein angiography to detect branch retinal artery occlusions\u2014sensitivity 85%, specificity 88%. Step 4: Pure\u2010tone audiometry showing low\u2010frequency sensorineural loss, air conduction thresholds elevated by 30\u201360 dB at 250\u20131000 Hz. Step 5: Laboratory evaluation: ANA, anti\u2010dsDNA, antiphospholipid panel to exclude lupus or APS; normal CRP and ESR in 60% of Susac cases. Step 6: CSF analysis often shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (5\u201320 cells/mm3) and elevated protein (50\u201380 mg/dL) without oligoclonal bands. Step 7: Optional digital subtraction angiography to exclude vasculitis. Step 8: Differential includes APS (positive lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin titers >40 GPL), MELAS (elevated lactate >2.5 mmol/L), CADASIL (NOTCH3 gene mutation). Distinguishing features: Susac lesions are small, multifocal, and central in corpus callosum, versus periventricular confluent white\u2010matter changes in CADASIL. Final diagnosis confirmed by meeting two of three diagnostic criteria per 2017 European Susac Consortium guidelines.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy: high\u2010dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 5 days, followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day taper over 6\u201312 months. Concurrent IVIG 2 g/kg divided over five days monthly for six months reduces relapse risk by 60%. Second\u2010line agents: mycophenolate mofetil 1,000 mg twice daily or azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day, initiated within four weeks if disease active. Third\u2010line: cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV every month for six cycles in refractory cases. Rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks is reserved for intolerant patients. Monitor complete blood count every two weeks, liver function monthly, and creatinine clearance quarterly. Contraindications: live vaccines during immunosuppression. Non\u2010pharmacological: plasma exchange in fulminant cases, cochlear implantation for permanent hearing loss (success rate 80%). Ocular laser photocoagulation is not beneficial. Supportive care includes vestibular rehabilitation and cognitive therapy. Special populations: pregnant women require prednisone monotherapy; avoid cyclophosphamide. In renal impairment, adjust cyclophosphamide to 500 mg/m2. Early aggressive treatment correlates with a 50% reduction in permanent disability.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurological and ophthalmologic evaluations at one, three, six, and twelve months. MRI with FLAIR and diffusion\u2010weighted sequences at three and twelve months to assess lesion resolution or new activity. Audiometry at baseline, three months, and annually. Target: no new lesions and stable hearing thresholds within 5 dB. Laboratory panels including CBC, liver and renal panels every three months. Long\u2010term complications include cognitive deficits in 40% and permanent hearing loss in 30%. One\u2010year remission rates reach 75%, five\u2010year sustained remission 60%. Rehabilitation: cognitive retraining sessions twice weekly for three months, vestibular therapy for at least six weeks. Educate patients about symptom recognition: new headache, visual blur, or tinnitus. Driving restriction until stable for three months without new MRI lesions. Provide resources: Susac Syndrome Foundation and National Organization for Rare Disorders. Return to light duty at three months, full activity by six months if stable.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What should be done next for her gait?","options":["Start natalizumab","Start glatiramer acetate","Steroid","4-aminopyridine"],"subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2023","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"4-aminopyridine","explanation":{"option_analysis":"In this scenario, the patient has multiple sclerosis (MS) and is on fingolimod, an oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT). She presents with spasticity and gait issues but shows no active disease on MRI. The correct answer to the question is D) 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine).\n\n### Correct Answer: D) 4-aminopyridine\n4-aminopyridine is an FDA-approved medication specifically indicated for improving walking speed in patients with MS. It works by blocking potassium channels, which enhances action potential conduction in demyelinated axons. This mechanism is particularly useful in MS, where demyelination leads to impaired neuronal transmission. The patient\u2019s symptoms of gait issues suggest that addressing this aspect of her functionality is a priority. Given that her MRI shows no new lesions, it indicates that her disease is stable, making it inappropriate to change her DMT.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n- A) Start natalizumab: Natalizumab is an immunomodulatory agent used in the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, particularly in cases of active disease or when there is a higher risk of relapses. Starting natalizumab in this patient would not address her current symptomatic complaints, and changing her DMT without evidence of disease activity is not warranted.\n\n- B) Start glatiramer acetate: Like natalizumab, glatiramer acetate is another DMT aimed at reducing relapse rates in MS. It is not indicated for symptomatic management and would not specifically improve her gait or spasticity.\n\n- C) Steroid: Corticosteroids are often used in the treatment of acute exacerbations of MS. However, since this patient\u2019s MRI shows no active disease, steroids are not appropriate, as they are unlikely to provide any benefit and could expose her to unnecessary side effects.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nMultiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination and neurodegeneration. The disease can manifest in various ways, with symptoms ranging from sensory disturbances to motor dysfunction, including gait impairment and spasticity. \n\nThe treatment landscape for MS consists of disease-modifying therapies aimed at reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disease progression, alongside symptomatic treatments that improve quality of life. In this case, the focus is on symptomatic management, which is essential for enhancing the functional abilities of patients like the one in this scenario.\n\n4-aminopyridine, specifically, acts on the neuronal action potential conduction and is beneficial for patients experiencing mobility challenges due to demyelination-related conduction block.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nIn MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks myelin, the protective sheath surrounding nerve fibers, leading to demyelination. This impairs the conduction of electrical impulses along the nerves, resulting in various neurological symptoms. The pathophysiological processes involve:\n\n- Inflammation: Activated immune cells, such as T cells and B cells, infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), causing localized inflammation and damage.\n- Demyelination: The loss of myelin disrupts normal nerve conduction, leading to symptoms such as weakness, sensory loss, and coordination problems.\n- Neurodegeneration: Over time, this inflammation and demyelination can lead to axonal damage and loss, contributing to the progressive nature of the disease.\n\nGait impairment in MS is often due to a combination of factors, including muscle weakness, spasticity, sensory deficits, and fatigue. Addressing these symptoms requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond modifying the underlying disease.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nThe clinical manifestations of MS vary widely among patients and can be categorized into relapsing-remitting, primary progressive, and secondary progressive forms. In the case of the patient:\n\n- Gait Issues: The patient presents with difficulties in walking, which may be characterized by a wide-based gait, unsteadiness, or a tendency to fall. These issues significantly impact mobility and independence.\n- Spasticity: This is often experienced as stiffness or tightness in the muscles, which can further contribute to gait abnormalities.\n- MRI Findings: The absence of active lesions on MRI suggests that the patient is not experiencing a current inflammatory process, which is critical in determining the management strategy.\n\nIn summary, the patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with chronic MS-related complications rather than an acute exacerbation, guiding the treatment focus towards symptomatic management.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnostic approach to MS includes:\n\n- Clinical Evaluation: A thorough history and physical examination to assess neurological function and identify symptoms.\n- MRI Scans: MRI is crucial for diagnosing MS and monitoring disease progression. In this case, the MRI shows no new lesions, indicating stable disease.\n- Lumbar Puncture: Although not necessary in this case, it can provide further diagnostic information, such as oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for gait impairment in this context may include other neurological conditions (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s disease, peripheral neuropathy) or musculoskeletal issues. However, the patient\u2019s established diagnosis of MS and the stable MRI findings support the conclusion that her gait issues are related to chronic MS symptoms rather than a new process.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nManagement of MS is multifaceted and includes both disease-modifying therapies and symptomatic treatments:\n\n### Disease-Modifying Therapies:\n- Fingolimod: As the patient is already on fingolimod, it is essential to continue monitoring its effectiveness, particularly in controlling relapses.\n\n### Symptomatic Treatments:\n- 4-Aminopyridine (Dalfampridine): This is the best option for improving gait in this patient. It can enhance walking speed and overall mobility, addressing her primary concerns.\n- Physical Therapy: A tailored physical therapy program can help improve balance, strength, and coordination, further aiding in mobility.\n- Spasticity Management: Options may include baclofen, tizanidine, or botulinum toxin injections if spasticity significantly impacts gait.\n\nThe goal of management in this case is to enhance the patient's quality of life and functional mobility while maintaining her current disease-modifying therapy.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nFollow-up for patients with MS involves regular assessments to monitor disease progression and treatment effectiveness:\n\n- Neurological Assessments: Regular evaluations to assess the patient\u2019s neurological status, including strength, coordination, and gait.\n- MRI Monitoring: Periodic MRI scans may be indicated to evaluate for new disease activity, especially if the patient experiences clinical changes.\n- Symptom Management: Continual assessment of spasticity and gait issues, adjusting treatments as needed, and providing referrals to rehabilitation specialists.\n\nPrognosis varies in MS, but with appropriate management, many patients can maintain a good quality of life. Complications can arise, such as secondary conditions from immobility (e.g., pressure sores, urinary tract infections), which should also be monitored.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- 4-Aminopyridine is specifically useful for gait issues in MS, especially in patients with stable disease.\n- MRI findings are key in guiding treatment decisions, particularly when evaluating disease activity.\n- A multidisciplinary approach that includes physical therapy and occupational therapy can significantly improve functional outcomes for patients with MS.\n- Symptomatic management is crucial in MS, as it directly impacts patients' quality of life.\n\n## 9.

It can enhance walking speed and overall mobility, addressing her primary concerns.\n- Physical Therapy: A tailored physical therapy program can help improve balance, strength, and coordination, further aiding in mobility.\n- Spasticity Management: Options may include baclofen, tizanidine, or botulinum toxin injections if spasticity significantly impacts gait.\n\nThe goal of management in this case is to enhance the patient's quality of life and functional mobility while maintaining her current disease-modifying therapy.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nFollow-up for patients with MS involves regular assessments to monitor disease progression and treatment effectiveness:\n\n- Neurological Assessments: Regular evaluations to assess the patient\u2019s neurological status, including strength, coordination, and gait.\n- MRI Monitoring: Periodic MRI scans may be indicated to evaluate for new disease activity, especially if the patient experiences clinical changes.\n- Symptom Management: Continual assessment of spasticity and gait issues, adjusting treatments as needed, and providing referrals to rehabilitation specialists.\n\nPrognosis varies in MS, but with appropriate management, many patients can maintain a good quality of life. Complications can arise, such as secondary conditions from immobility (e.g., pressure sores, urinary tract infections), which should also be monitored.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- 4-Aminopyridine is specifically useful for gait issues in MS, especially in patients with stable disease.\n- MRI findings are key in guiding treatment decisions, particularly when evaluating disease activity.\n- A multidisciplinary approach that includes physical therapy and occupational therapy can significantly improve functional outcomes for patients with MS.\n- Symptomatic management is crucial in MS, as it directly impacts patients' quality of life.\n\n## 9. References","clinical_manifestation":"The clinical manifestations of MS vary widely among patients and can be categorized into relapsing-remitting, primary progressive, and secondary progressive forms. In the case of the patient:\n\n- Gait Issues: The patient presents with difficulties in walking, which may be characterized by a wide-based gait, unsteadiness, or a tendency to fall. These issues significantly impact mobility and independence.\n- Spasticity: This is often experienced as stiffness or tightness in the muscles, which can further contribute to gait abnormalities.\n- MRI Findings: The absence of active lesions on MRI suggests that the patient is not experiencing a current inflammatory process, which is critical in determining the management strategy.\n\nIn summary, the patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with chronic MS-related complications rather than an acute exacerbation, guiding the treatment focus towards symptomatic management.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnostic approach to MS includes:\n\n- Clinical Evaluation: A thorough history and physical examination to assess neurological function and identify symptoms.\n- MRI Scans: MRI is crucial for diagnosing MS and monitoring disease progression. In this case, the MRI shows no new lesions, indicating stable disease.\n- Lumbar Puncture: Although not necessary in this case, it can provide further diagnostic information, such as oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for gait impairment in this context may include other neurological conditions (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s disease, peripheral neuropathy) or musculoskeletal issues.

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), approved for relapsing\u2013remitting MS, mediates its therapeutic effect via activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) antioxidant pathway. Landmark trials DEFINE/CONFIRM (Gold R et al. 2012) showed a 53% reduction in ARR versus placebo.
