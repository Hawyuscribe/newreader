[{"question_number":"2","question":"An elderly patient presented to the neurology clinic with complaints of progressive memory problems. The physician prescribed medication for him. After 2 weeks, he presented with nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea. Which of the following is the most likely prescribed medication?","options":["Memantine","Rivastigmine"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Rivastigmine","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. Rivastigmine. Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used in Alzheimer disease that increases acetylcholine levels in the synaptic cleft by inhibiting both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea are common adverse effects of cholinesterase inhibitors, occurring in up to 30\u201340% of patients (Birks J. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2006;4:CD005593). Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is generally better tolerated gastrointestinally and is less likely to produce pronounced GI symptoms. Option A (Memantine) is therefore incorrect because its side-effect profile is characterized more by dizziness, headache, and confusion rather than GI upset.","conceptual_foundation":"Dementia due to Alzheimer disease is characterized by progressive decline in memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial skills. Acetylcholine deficiency in the basal forebrain and cortex correlates with cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) constitute first-line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer dementia by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, thereby prolonging acetylcholine action. Rivastigmine uniquely inhibits both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, which may confer benefits in various stages of disease. Its metabolism involves cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis rather than hepatic cytochrome P450, which influences its side-effect profile and drug interaction potential.","pathophysiology":"In Alzheimer disease, amyloid-\u03b2 peptide deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss, especially cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Reduced cholinergic transmission contributes to memory and learning deficits. Rivastigmine\u2019s inhibition of cholinesterase enzymes increases acetylcholine concentrations at central synapses, partly compensating for the loss of cholinergic neurons. However, peripheral cholinesterase inhibition increases smooth muscle and glandular activity in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea.","clinical_manifestation":"Rivastigmine\u2019s therapeutic administration commonly leads to GI adverse effects: nausea (25\u201335%), vomiting (10\u201320%), diarrhea (15\u201325%), and anorexia with weight loss (5\u201310%) (AAN Practice Guideline, 2011). These effects are dose-related and most pronounced during dose escalation in the first 4\u20138 weeks of therapy. Memantine\u2019s side-effect profile lacks prominent GI symptoms, making rivastigmine the likely culprit in this presentation.","diagnostic_approach":"Alzheimer dementia diagnosis is clinical, supported by cognitive testing (MMSE, MoCA) demonstrating deficits in two or more cognitive domains and functional impairment. Neuroimaging (MRI brain) excludes other causes. CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242, total tau, phosphorylated tau) and PET imaging (amyloid or FDG) may be used in atypical or early-onset cases. Once diagnosed, cholinesterase inhibitors are indicated for mild to moderate disease, with rivastigmine dosage titrated from 1.5 mg BID up to 6 mg BID as tolerated.","management_principles":"Rivastigmine dosing begins at 1.5 mg twice daily, increasing by 1.5 mg BID every 4 weeks to a target of 6 mg BID, or using a transdermal patch (4.6 mg/24 h up to 13.3 mg/24 h) to reduce GI adverse effects (AAN 2011; Class I evidence). GI symptoms can be mitigated by slow titration, taking with food, or switching to patch formulation. Memantine is reserved for moderate to severe disease (MMSE < 10) and has minimal GI toxicity.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor cognition and functional status every 3\u20136 months with MMSE or MoCA. Assess for GI side effects during titration and afterward; adjust dose or formulation if intolerable. Evaluate weight monthly during initial titration. Educate caregivers on adherence and symptom reporting.","clinical_pearls":"1. Rivastigmine patch reduces GI side effects compared to oral dosing. 2. Start low and go slow when titrating cholinesterase inhibitors to improve tolerability. 3. Memantine is better tolerated GI-wise and used in moderate to severe Alzheimer dementia. 4. GI adverse effects often peak in the first 4\u20136 weeks of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy. 5. Cholinesterase inhibitor GI toxicity is dose-dependent; dose reduction may alleviate symptoms.","references":"1. Birks JS. Cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

Which of the following genes increases the risk of sporadic Alzheimer disease?","options":["APP","Apolipoprotein E"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Apolipoprotein E","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. Apolipoprotein E (APOE). APOE \u03b54 is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic late-onset Alzheimer disease, as shown in multiple large cohort studies and meta-analyses. Farrer et al. (1997) performed a meta-analysis of 40 studies and found that a single \u03b54 allele increases risk 2\u20133-fold, while homozygosity increases risk 8\u201312-fold (OR for \u03b54/\u03b54 = 11.6, 95% CI 6.5\u201320.7). A genome-wide association meta-analysis by Lambert et al. (2013) confirmed APOE as the major susceptibility locus with an OR of 3.7 (95% CI 3.4\u20134.1) for \u03b53/\u03b54 carriers. By contrast, APP mutations (option A) are causative for familial autosomal dominant early-onset AD (<1% of cases) and do not increase risk of sporadic late-onset disease. Common APP variants show no significant association with sporadic AD risk in large population studies (Seshadri et al. 2010). A common misconception is confusing deterministic early-onset mutations (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) with risk alleles in late-onset AD; only APOE \u03b54 meets criteria for a major sporadic risk factor according to AAN and NIA-AA guidelines.","conceptual_foundation":"Alzheimer disease (AD) is classified under ICD-11 code 6D83.0 as a primary neurodegenerative dementia. It is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, most prominently episodic memory impairment, due to accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. AD is subdivided into: 1) early-onset familial AD (EOAD, onset <65 years), caused by deterministic mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2; and 2) late-onset sporadic AD (LOAD, onset \u226565 years), influenced by risk alleles such as APOE \u03b54 and environmental factors. The taxonomic classification evolved after the discovery of APP in 1991 and APOE in 1993. Differential diagnoses include Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Neuroanatomically, AD pathology targets the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and association cortices, derived embryologically from the telencephalon. Molecularly, APOE, encoded on chromosome 19q13.2, exists as \u03b52, \u03b53, \u03b54 isoforms. The \u03b54 isoform alters lipid transport, receptor binding, and A\u03b2 clearance, thereby modulating risk.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, APOE facilitates cholesterol transport, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal repair. APOE isoforms differ at residues 112 and 158; \u03b54 (Arg112/Arg158) shows reduced lipid binding and impaired receptor interactions. In APOE \u03b54 carriers, decreased A\u03b2 clearance via low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans leads to increased A\u03b2 oligomerization and plaque deposition. This initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation (via GSK-3\u03b2 activation), neuroinflammation (microglial and astrocyte activation), synaptic loss, and neuronal death. Biomarker studies (Jack et al. 2018) demonstrate early A\u03b2 accumulation decades before clinical onset, followed by tauopathy and neurodegeneration. APP mutation carriers directly overproduce A\u03b242, whereas APOE \u03b54 modulates A\u03b2 clearance, explaining its role as a risk factor rather than a deterministic cause.","clinical_manifestation":"LOAD typically presents after age 65 with insidious episodic memory loss, difficulty with new learning, and language dysfunction. Over 50% of patients exhibit an amnestic presentation; atypical variants (posterior cortical atrophy, logopenic aphasia) comprise <10%. APOE \u03b54 carriers manifest symptoms 5\u201310 years earlier than non-carriers. The prodromal phase (MCI due to AD) lasts 2\u20135 years, with \u03b54 homozygotes showing faster progression (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5\u20132.6). Untreated, patients decline over 8\u201312 years to severe dementia and death. NIA-AA 2011 criteria require clinical syndrome plus biomarkers: CSF A\u03b242\u2193, tau\u2191 (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%), or amyloid PET (sensitivity 88%, specificity 96%).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: detailed history, cognitive testing (MMSE, MoCA), laboratory tests to exclude reversible causes, MRI to rule out structural lesions (AAN 2018, Level B). Second-tier: CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242, total and phosphorylated tau) with sensitivity/specificity ~85\u201390% (NIA-AA 2018, GRADE A); amyloid PET imaging (sensitivity 88%, specificity 96%). Genetic testing for APOE is not recommended for routine diagnosis due to limited predictive value and ethical concerns (AAN Practice Parameter 2011). Third-tier: FDG-PET for metabolic patterns, tau PET in research contexts, emerging plasma biomarkers (p-tau217) with high correlation to CSF and PET.","management_principles":"Symptomatic therapies include cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) which improve cognition by ~2\u20133 MMSE points at 6 months (NNT=12, Level A), and memantine for moderate-severe AD (NNT=9, Level B). Dosing: donepezil 5\u201310 mg PO daily, rivastigmine patch 4.6\u201313.3 mg/day, memantine 5\u201320 mg/day. Monitor for GI upset, bradycardia, dizziness. Aducanumab received accelerated FDA approval (2021) based on plaque reduction (EMERGE/ENGAGE trials), though clinical benefit remains debated. Non-pharmacologic: cognitive training, exercise, caregiver support; vascular risk factor control may slow progression.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor every 3\u20136 months with cognitive scales (MMSE, MoCA), functional assessments (ADCS-ADL), and behavioral rating scales (NPI-Q). Baseline and annual ECG for cholinesterase inhibitors; monitor weight and nutrition. Imaging follow-up is not routinely required unless atypical features or rapid decline. Genetic counseling for families. Prognosis: \u03b54 homozygotes decline faster; higher education and cognitive reserve slow progression. Care planning should include advance directives, driving assessments, and home safety evaluations.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Semantic dementia","Primary progressive aphasia","Frontotemporal lobe dementia"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Primary progressive aphasia","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Semantic dementia (fluent variant of frontotemporal lobar degeneration) presents with progressive loss of word meaning, surface dyslexia, impaired comprehension, and preserved repetition. Patients speak fluently but produce empty speech, cannot define common objects, and exhibit early behavioral changes. Our patient retains comprehension but has impaired repetition and naming, excluding semantic dementia. Option B: Primary progressive aphasia (nonfluent/agrammatic variant) is characterized by insidious onset of effortful, halting speech, agrammatism, impaired naming and repetition, and relatively preserved single-word comprehension. Memory, visuospatial skills, and behavior remain intact early. This matches our patient\u2019s expression difficulty, naming deficits, and spared comprehension, making PPA definitively correct. Option C: Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia involves early personality and executive dysfunction, disinhibition, apathy, and compulsivity. Language is relatively preserved until later. While language variants of FTD exist, the classic FTD phenotype does not present with isolated progressive aphasia. Our patient lacks behavioral and executive changes, ruling out classic FTD. Option D: Alzheimer\u2019s disease typically begins with episodic memory loss, visuospatial deficits, and later language impairment. Expression and repetition remain intact until advanced stages. Isolated, nonfluent aphasia without significant memory loss or visuospatial decline is not characteristic of Alzheimer\u2019s. Common misconception: clinicians sometimes misattribute nonfluent PPA to stroke or Alzheimer\u2019s, delaying appropriate evaluation (PPA accounts for ~3\u20134% of dementias). Nonfluent PPA pathology is linked to tau and TDP-43 protein aggregation in the left inferior frontal and insular cortex causing progressive neuronal loss.","conceptual_foundation":"Primary progressive aphasia (nonfluent/agrammatic variant) localizes anatomically to the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus (Broca\u2019s area), adjacent insula, and underlying white matter tracts (arcuate fasciculus) that subserve articulatory planning and grammar. Embryologically, Broca\u2019s region derives from the rostral telencephalon, with neuronal migration guided by reelin and notch signaling. Physiologically, these cortical areas integrate anterior language production, syntactic parsing, and complex motor planning for speech via glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons. Disruption of these networks leads to agrammatism and apraxia of speech while sparing Wernicke\u2019s receptive area in the superior temporal gyrus. Related syndromes include semantic dementia (temporal pole pathology) and logopenic variant PPA (posterior perisylvian/temporoparietal). Historically, Mesulam first described PPA in 1982 as progressive language decline without memory impairment. Landmark neuroanatomic studies by Dronkers et al. refined Brodmann area 44/45 involvement in nonfluent aphasia. Key landmarks include the Sylvian fissure, pars opercularis, pars triangularis, insular cortex, and subcortical U-fibers, whose integrity is essential for healthy expressive language function.","pathophysiology":"Nonfluent PPA pathogenesis involves abnormal aggregation of tau (MAPT gene mutations in ~10\u201320% familial cases) or TDP-43 (GRN and C9orf72 expansions in ~30\u201340%) leading to neuronal cytoskeletal disruption and synaptic loss. Misfolded tau proteins form neurofibrillary tangles, triggering microglial activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), which exacerbate neurodegeneration. TDP-43 inclusions impair RNA splicing and axonal transport. Mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired oxidative phosphorylation reduce ATP production, compromising high-energy language networks. Oligodendrocyte pathology disrupts myelin sheaths along the arcuate fasciculus, slowing conduction. Over months to years, progressive atrophy of inferior frontal and insular cortex is seen on MRI. Compensatory hypertrophy of contralateral homologous regions and increased reliance on right hemisphere language areas temporarily maintain function but ultimately fail as pathology spreads, leading to global language decline over 5\u20137 years on average.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is insidious, with mild speech hesitancy progressing over 12\u201324 months to overt nonfluent, effortful speech. Early features include word-finding pauses, phonemic paraphasias, and agrammatism. Naming and repetition decline over the first 2 years, while comprehension of complex sentences remains intact. Neurological exam reveals apraxia of speech, reduced verbal fluency (letters: <8 words/minute), and preserved limb strength. In elderly patients (>65 years) presentation may overlap with age-related cognitive slowing; in younger (<60) familial forms are more common. Gender distribution is slightly male-predominant (55%). No systemic manifestations occur early. Severity scales such as the Progressive Aphasia Severity Scale (PASS) grade language impairment from mild (1) to severe (4). Red flags include rapid progression (<6 months) suggesting alternative etiologies. Without treatment, patients lose functional communication by year 5 and may develop behavioral variant FTD features over time.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Perform detailed language and cognitive assessment, including Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) and PASS scores to confirm nonfluent pattern (per AAN 2023 guidelines). 2. Administer standardized screening such as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment focusing on language domain (sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%) (per International PPA Consortium 2022 criteria). 3. Obtain high-resolution MRI brain with 3D T1 and FLAIR sequences to detect focal left inferior frontal and insular atrophy (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). 4. Consider FDG-PET to reveal hypometabolism in Broca\u2019s region, distinguishing PPA from Alzheimer\u2019s pattern (posterior temporoparietal) (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2021). 5. Perform CSF analysis for Alzheimer biomarkers (A\u00df42, total tau, p-tau) to exclude Alzheimer\u2019s pathology: normal ratios support PPA (per International Consensus Criteria for PPA 2018). 6. Genetic testing for MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72 mutations in familial cases (per Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Consortium 2020). 7.

Tier 2 (Second-line): Off-label use of cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil starting at 5 mg PO nightly, titrated to 10 mg after 4 weeks, may provide modest benefit in language retention (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2021). Tier 3 (Third-line): Consider memantine 5 mg PO BID increasing to 10 mg BID over 4 weeks in refractory cases to target glutamatergic excitotoxicity (per International Frontotemporal Dementia Clinical Trial Guidelines 2019). Non-pharmacological support includes augmentative communication devices and caregiver training (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Monitor for cholinesterase inhibitor side effects: bradycardia, GI upset; adjust dose in hepatic impairment. Avoid benzodiazepines due to risk of sedation and speech suppression.

At each visit, reassess speech via PASS and track WAB scores with a goal of \u22641-point decline per year. Repeat MRI annually to monitor atrophy progression. Screen for emergent behavioral changes or parkinsonism. Brain stimulation therapies (rTMS) may be trialed at 12-month mark if speech continues to worsen. Anticipate loss of independent communication by year 4\u20136; plan for durable power of attorney and advance directives. Offer occupational and physical therapy referrals within 6 months of diagnosis. Provide patient and caregiver education on disease course, safety in swallowing, and driving cessation guidelines.

APP. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21 is one of three autosomal dominant genes (alongside PSEN1 and PSEN2) in which pathogenic mutations cause early\u2010onset familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). APP mutations alter proteolytic cleavage, increasing production of aggregation\u2010prone A\u03b242 peptides. Multiple cohort studies (e.g., Goate et al., 1991; Chartier\u2010Harlin et al., 1991) demonstrated that APP missense mutations segregate with disease in kindreds with onset before age 65, with nearly 100% penetrance by age 60\u201365 years. In contrast, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) \u03b54 is a common risk allele that increases sporadic AD risk (odds ratio ~3\u201312) but does not cause familial AD.

Familial early\u2010onset AD (EOAD) accounts for <1% of all AD and follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The three primary genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) were identified in the early 1990s via linkage analyses of pedigrees with multiple affected members. APP lies on chromosome 21q21; its product is cleaved by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases to yield A\u03b2 peptides. Pathogenic APP mutations cluster near secretase cleavage sites, biasing toward the longer A\u03b242 variant. PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode presenilin components of the \u03b3-secretase complex. ApoE is on chromosome 19 and encodes a lipid-transport protein with isoforms \u03b52/\u03b53/\u03b54; \u03b54 confers risk via impaired A\u03b2 clearance but is neither necessary nor sufficient for familial cases.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, APP is processed via the non\u2010amyloidogenic \u03b1\u2010secretase pathway producing soluble fragments. Mutant APP undergoes enhanced \u03b2- and altered \u03b3-secretase cleavage, increasing A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. A\u03b242 oligomerizes, forming extracellular plaques, triggering synaptic dysfunction, microglial activation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles ensue, leading to neuronal loss. Familial APP mutations (e.g., V717I) increase absolute A\u03b242 levels (by ~30\u201350%) and accelerate aggregation kinetics. The resulting neuropathology shows diffuse and neuritic plaques, especially in hippocampus and association cortices, consistent with Braak stages V\u2013VI.","clinical_manifestation":"Familial APP mutation carriers typically present between ages 40\u201360 with insidious episodic memory impairment, progressing over 5\u201310 years to global cognitive decline, apraxia, aphasia, and executive dysfunction. Neurologic examination may reveal parkinsonism or myoclonus in advanced stages. Behavioral changes, including apathy and agitation, are common. Unlike sporadic late\u2010onset AD, vascular comorbidities are less frequent; trisomy 21 patients over 40 also exhibit AD pathology but represent a distinct model.","diagnostic_approach":"In suspected EOAD, evaluation includes detailed family history, neuropsychological testing, brain MRI (showing medial temporal atrophy), and CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242 decrease, elevated total tau and p-tau). Genetic testing for APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 is indicated in patients with onset <65 and >2 first\u2010degree relatives affected. ApoE genotyping is not recommended for diagnostic purposes per AAN guidelines (Level B). Pretest counseling and confirmatory Sanger or next\u2010generation sequencing with coverage of canonical exons are standard.","management_principles":"No disease\u2010modifying therapy exists. Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine) and the NMDA antagonist memantine provide modest symptomatic benefit (NNT ~12 for cognitive stabilization at 6 months). Clinical trials of anti\u2010A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab, lecanemab) show plaque reduction but variable clinical effect. Management includes cognitive rehabilitation, behavioral interventions, and support for caregivers.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up every 6\u201312 months with cognitive scales (MMSE, MoCA) and functional assessments (ADL scales). Monitor for medication side effects (bradycardia, GI symptoms) and behavioral disturbances. Genetic counseling for at\u2010risk relatives is recommended; predictive testing follows NIH criteria with psychological support.","clinical_pearls":"1. APP mutations cause autosomal dominant EOAD with nearly complete penetrance by age 65. 2. ApoE \u03b54 is a risk allele, not a causative gene\u2014used for research, not clinical diagnosis. 3. CSF A\u03b242/tau ratio is >90% sensitive and specific for AD pathology in EOAD. 4. Anti\u2010A\u03b2 therapies require MRI screening for ARIA risk, especially in mutation carriers. 5. Always perform pre\u2010 and post\u2010test genetic counseling when testing APP, PSEN1, PSEN2.","references":"1. Goate A, et al.
