PAN computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["PPMS.","NMOSD.","Sj\u00f6gren disease.","Sarcoidosis."],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Sj\u00f6gren disease.","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most likely diagnosis is Sj\u00f6gren disease given the presence of ANA positivity, longitudinally extensive myelitis (LETM) from C6 to T9 and bilateral optic neuritis. Although NMOSD classically presents with LETM and optic neuritis, the absence of aquaporin-4 antibodies and oligoclonal bands alongside positive ANA suggests an underlying connective-tissue disorder. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) would not present with LETM or severe optic neuritis of this acuity. Sarcoidosis often shows pulmonary findings or noncaseating granulomas on biopsy and typical imaging changes. Therefore, Sj\u00f6gren disease is the best unifying diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurological involvement in Sj\u00f6gren disease arises from autoimmune lymphocytic infiltration targeting exocrine glands and occasionally the CNS. Sj\u00f6gren disease is classified under systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases in ICD-11 (DD85.0) and is differentiated from NMOSD (8A40) and MS (8A40.0) by serology (anti-SSA/SSB), glandular biopsy, and lack of CNS-specific antibodies. Historically, Sj\u00f6gren-associated myelitis was recognized after the identification of anti-SSA/SSB antibodies; it is now understood as one of the secondary causes of LETM. Embryologically, exocrine gland epithelia derive from ectoderm; CNS involvement reflects systemic autoimmunity crossing the blood-brain barrier. Neuroanatomically, the cervical and thoracic spinal cord segments are susceptible due to watershed perfusion zones; autoimmune infiltrates can occupy multiple segments. Molecularly, B-cell hyperactivity, anti-SSA/SSB antibodies, elevated BAFF levels, and Th17 skewing drive pathology.","pathophysiology":"Normal spinal cord physiology includes oligodendrocyte-mediated myelination and intact axonal conduction. In Sj\u00f6gren disease, autoantibody-mediated complement activation and lymphocytic infiltration target spinal cord myelin and axons, producing demyelination across several segments (LETM). Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and chemokines facilitate leukocyte trafficking into the CNS. Chronic inflammation leads to gliosis and axonal loss manifesting as persistent deficits. The optic nerves are similarly affected via perivenular inflammation. This differs from NMOSD, where AQP4-IgG directly binds astrocyte foot processes causing necrotic lesions and cavitation.","clinical_manifestation":"Up to 20% of Sj\u00f6gren patients have neurological involvement; transverse myelitis occurs in ~1\u20135%. Presentation is subacute over days with paraparesis, sensory level, sphincter dysfunction, and visual loss in cases of concomitant optic neuritis. Sicca symptoms and arthralgias often precede neurologic events by years. On examination, pyramidal signs, a defined sensory level, and decreased visual acuity are noted. Unlike NMOSD, relapses may be less frequent but more heterogeneous in location. Diagnostic criteria for secondary Sj\u00f6gren myelitis include positive anti-SSA/SSB, salivary gland biopsy with focal lymphocytic sialadenitis, and exclusion of NMOSD/MOGAD.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier studies: ANA, anti-SSA/SSB, ESR/CRP, MRI spine demonstrating LETM (>3 vertebral segments). CSF may show mild lymphocytosis, elevated protein, negative OCB. Second-tier: Schirmer test, salivary gland biopsy (focus score \u22651). Exclude AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG (both negative here), and evaluate for sarcoidosis with chest imaging if indicated. The combination of systemic autoimmunity and CNS demyelination confirms diagnosis.","management_principles":"Acute myelitis: high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day \u00d75 days) followed by slow oral taper. Maintenance immunosuppression with azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg/day) or mycophenolate mofetil (1\u20132 g/day). Rituximab is reserved for refractory cases (Level C evidence). Sicca management: artificial tears, pilocarpine. Monitor for steroid side effects and infection risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurologic assessment every 3 months initially, then biannually if stable. MRI spine at 6 months and annually thereafter to assess for new lesions. Monitor CBC, LFTs every 3 months while on immunosuppressants. Regular ophthalmology evaluation for optic nerve recovery.","clinical_pearls":"1. LETM + AQP4-IgG negativity + ANA positivity = consider Sj\u00f6gren-associated myelitis. 2. Salivary gland biopsy is diagnostic in seropositive patients. 3. B-cell depletion (rituximab) effective in refractory Sj\u00f6gren myelitis. 4.

Which of the following is the best symptomatic therapy for her current symptoms (paroxysmal spasms)?","options":["Modafenil.","Carbamazepine.","Dalfampridine.","Amantadine."],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Carbamazepine","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Carbamazepine is the first-line symptomatic therapy for paroxysmal spasms in multiple sclerosis due to its sodium\u2010channel\u2013blocking properties. Clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommend carbamazepine (Level B evidence) based on class III studies demonstrating a significant reduction in both frequency and severity of painful tonic spasms (Khan et al. Neurology 2012;79:677\u2013683). Modafinil (Option A) and amantadine (Option D) are used primarily for MS\u2010related fatigue and have no proven efficacy for treating paroxysmal spasms. Dalfampridine (Option C) improves walking speed by enhancing conduction in demyelinated fibers but does not address episodic tonic spasms. A common misconception is equating spasticity management with treatment of paroxysmal spasms; however, only sodium\u2010channel blockers reliably abort the ectopic discharges underlying these brief, painful events.","conceptual_foundation":"Paroxysmal spasms in MS arise from ephaptic cross\u2010talk between demyelinated axons, where aberrant redistribution of voltage\u2010gated sodium channels (Nav1.2) along exposed segments lowers the threshold for ectopic firing. MS is an immune\u2010mediated demyelinating disease (ICD-11 code 8A40) with dissemination in time and space, evidenced in this patient by prior optic neuritis and current sphincter disturbances. Neuropathologically, perivenular inflammation and focal demyelination produce plaques in cerebral and spinal white matter, particularly the cervical cord, leading to conduction abnormalities. Genetic predisposition (HLA-DRB1*15:01), environmental triggers (vitamin D deficiency), and dysregulated T-cell responses against myelin basic protein underlie disease initiation. The molecular cascade\u2014driven by microglial activation, complement deposition, and blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown\u2014creates the substrate for aberrant neuronal excitability targeted by sodium\u2010channel blockers.","pathophysiology":"Normally, saltatory conduction confines sodium channels to nodes of Ranvier, enabling efficient impulse propagation. In demyelinated segments, compensatory upregulation of sodium channels along internodes creates zones of hyperexcitability. Ephaptic transmission occurs when an action potential in one fiber passively depolarizes an adjacent fiber, triggering spontaneous discharges manifesting as brief tonic spasms. Carbamazepine stabilizes the inactivated state of voltage\u2010gated sodium channels, raising the threshold for repetitive firing and preventing ectopic action potentials. This mechanism differs from antispasticity agents like baclofen, which act on GABA_B receptors to modulate spinal reflex arcs, and from dalfampridine, which broadens action potentials to improve conduction but does not suppress paroxysmal firing.","clinical_manifestation":"Paroxysmal spasms present as sudden, painful tonic contractions of limbs lasting seconds to minutes, often triggered by movement or sensory stimuli. Frequency ranges from a few episodes per day to dozens, significantly impairing quality of life. Awareness is preserved, and there is no postictal confusion, distinguishing these events from epileptic seizures. Associated findings include hyperreflexia, clonus, and other upper motor neuron signs. In this 32-year-old woman with relapsing-remitting MS, the history of optic neuritis and urinary sphincter involvement confirms dissemination. Spasms typically occur in the arms and legs, are asymmetric, and may be accompanied by sensory aura or Lhermitte\u2019s sign.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by a history of stereotyped, brief painful spasms in a patient with established MS. MRI of brain and spine demonstrates demyelinating plaques with T2 hyperintensities and contrast enhancement. Somatosensory evoked potentials show conduction delay. Video\u2010EEG during events reveals no epileptiform discharges, distinguishing spasms from focal seizures. CSF analysis may show oligoclonal bands. The differential includes stiff-person syndrome (anti-GAD antibodies), focal motor seizures, and symptomatic spinal cord lesions. Recognition of triggers and preserved consciousness is key to accurate diagnosis.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is carbamazepine, initiated at 100 mg twice daily and titrated up to 600\u20131200 mg/day based on efficacy and tolerability. AAN guidelines (Thompson et al. Lancet Neurol 2018;17:162\u2013173) support this approach (Level B). Alternatives for carbamazepine\u2010intolerant patients include oxcarbazepine or phenytoin. Nonpharmacological measures involve avoiding precipitating factors (sudden movements, heat). Disease\u2010modifying therapies (e.g., interferon-\u03b2, fingolimod) reduce relapse rates and may indirectly decrease paroxysmal events. Adverse effects of carbamazepine\u2014hyponatremia, rash, marrow suppression\u2014necessitate baseline and periodic monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor symptom frequency monthly, adjusting carbamazepine dose to balance efficacy with side effects. Obtain baseline and quarterly CBC, LFTs, and serum sodium. Evaluate MS disease activity via clinical exam and MRI every 6\u201312 months to guide modification of disease\u2010modifying therapy. Provide patient education on medication adherence, recognition of adverse effects, and when to seek urgent care for severe hyponatremia or rash.","clinical_pearls":"1. Paroxysmal tonic spasms in MS arise from ephaptic transmission and respond best to sodium\u2010channel blockers. 2. Preservation of consciousness and lack of postictal state distinguish them from seizures. 3. Dalfampridine improves gait but does not treat spasms. 4. Monitor sodium and CBC when using carbamazepine. 5. Avoid conflating spasticity management with treatment of paroxysmal spasms\u2014different mechanisms require different agents.","references":"1.
