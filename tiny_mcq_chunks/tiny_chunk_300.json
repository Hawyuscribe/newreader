[{"question_number":"1","question":"A case scenario of a patient with myopathy and malignant hyperthermia is presented. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Central core myopathy","Duchenne muscular dystrophy","Becker muscular dystrophy","Myotonic dystrophy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Central core myopathy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Central core myopathy) is correct. Central core disease is a congenital myopathy linked to mutations in the RYR1 gene and is classically associated with susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. Patients often present in infancy or childhood with hypotonia, proximal muscle weakness, delayed motor milestones, and characteristic 'cores' seen on muscle biopsy. In contrast, Duchenne (Option B) and Becker (Option C) muscular dystrophies are X\u2010linked dystrophinopathies without a direct link to malignant hyperthermia. Myotonic dystrophy (Option D) presents with myotonia and multisystem involvement rather than acute hypermetabolic crises. Evidence from multiple case series (e.g., Jungbluth et al., Neuromuscul Disord, 2018) shows RYR1 variants in central core disease confer malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in up to 80% of families tested.","conceptual_foundation":"Central core myopathy belongs to congenital myopathies (ICD-11: FA50.0). It is part of a group of structural muscle disorders characterized by developmental defects of the muscle fiber, distinct from muscular dystrophies and metabolic myopathies. The hallmark is central areas ('cores') devoid of oxidative enzyme activity on histochemistry. RYR1 encodes the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor involved in calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Mutations lead to dysregulated calcium homeostasis, predisposing to malignant hyperthermia under triggering anesthetics. Differential diagnoses include other congenital myopathies (e.g., nemaline, centronuclear), which lack malignant hyperthermia risk.","pathophysiology":"Normal excitation\u2013contraction coupling depends on RYR1 gating calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. In central core disease, RYR1 mutations cause leaky channels, elevated resting intracellular Ca2+, mitochondrial dysfunction, and generation of cores. Under triggering agents (volatile anesthetics, succinylcholine), uncontrolled Ca2+ release triggers a hypermetabolic state with muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, metabolic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. This contrasts with dystrophinopathies, where membrane fragility leads to CK elevation but not malignant hyperthermia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with central core disease present with neonatal or early childhood hypotonia, delayed milestones, proximal muscle weakness (shoulder and hip girdle), and often scoliosis. Some remain ambulatory into adulthood with mild weakness. Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility manifests as a perioperative hypermetabolic syndrome: rapid rise in end\u2010tidal CO2, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, acidosis, and hyperkalemia. In Becker and Duchenne dystrophies, calf pseudohypertrophy and progressive loss of ambulation occur but without MH crises. Myotonic dystrophy shows characteristic myotonia, cataracts, endocrine dysfunction, and cardiac conduction defects.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes creatine kinase (mildly elevated), EMG showing myopathic changes without myotonia, and muscle biopsy with central cores on NADH\u2010TR. Genetic testing for RYR1 variants confirms diagnosis. If MH susceptibility is suspected, an in vitro contracture test (IVCT) per EMHG protocol or RYR1 gene panel is indicated. Dystrophinopathies are diagnosed by dystrophin immunostaining and dystrophin gene testing. Myotonic dystrophy uses DMPK or CNBP repeat expansion testing.","management_principles":"Avoidance of triggering agents (volatile anesthetics, succinylcholine) is paramount. Use total intravenous anesthesia with dantrolene standby. Dantrolene sodium (2.5 mg/kg IV initial dose) remains the treatment of choice for MH episodes. Supportive care includes active cooling, correction of acidosis, management of hyperkalemia, and monitoring for compartment syndrome and myoglobinuria. Physical therapy may help maintain muscle strength. Genetic counseling is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Preoperative MH risk evaluation should include detailed family history and previous anesthetic records. Patients with central core disease require MH precaution alerts and MedicAlert bracelets. Regular neuromuscular follow-up monitors respiratory function (spirometry), scoliosis progression (spine X\u2010rays), and muscle strength. Cardiac evaluation is not routinely required unless variants in RYR1 with cardiomyopathy phenotypes are identified.","clinical_pearls":"1. Central core disease is the congenital myopathy most strongly linked to malignant hyperthermia due to RYR1 mutations. 2. Muscle biopsy with central cores on oxidative stains is diagnostic; genetic testing confirms. 3. Always avoid succinylcholine and volatile anesthetics in known or suspected cases. 4. Dantrolene is the definitive treatment for malignant hyperthermia crises. 5. RYR1 gene panel testing also identifies susceptibility to exertional rhabdomyolysis.","references":"1.

In classic autosomal recessive inheritance, when both parents are carriers of a pathogenic mutation (as in spinal muscular atrophy due to SMN1 gene mutations), each pregnancy carries a 25% chance of producing an affected child, a 50% chance of producing a carrier (unaffected) child, and a 25% chance of producing a non\u2010carrier unaffected child. Option B (25% carriers) is incorrect because the carrier risk is 50%, not 25%. Option C (50% normal) is incorrect because only 25% of offspring will be homozygous normal; 50% will be carriers and 25% will be affected. Option D (50% affected) is incorrect because autosomal recessive inheritance does not confer a 50% risk of being affected when both parents are carriers, but rather a 25% risk.","conceptual_foundation":"Autosomal recessive inheritance requires two pathogenic alleles\u2014one from each parent\u2014for disease manifestation. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by biallelic loss of SMN1 gene function, typically through homozygous deletion of exon 7. Carrier parents each have one functional and one mutated SMN1 allele. Mendelian genetics dictates that at each conception, gametes combine with a 25% probability of receiving the mutant allele from both parents (affected), 50% probability of one mutant plus one normal allele (carrier), and 25% probability of two normal alleles (unaffected non\u2010carrier). This framework is encompassed in nosology (ICD-11: 8A00.1 Spinal muscular atrophy) and is fundamental to genetic counseling and recurrence risk prediction.","pathophysiology":"Spinal muscular atrophy is characterized by degeneration of anterior horn motor neurons due to insufficient levels of Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein encoded by SMN1. Homozygous loss leads to motor neuron apoptosis, muscle atrophy, and weakness. Heterozygous carriers produce roughly 50% of normal SMN protein levels, which is sufficient to prevent disease. Pathogenic mechanism follows Mendelian recessive inheritance, where two pathogenic alleles are required to manifest clinical pathology; hence, only 25% of offspring of carrier parents will be homozygous for the mutation and develop disease.","clinical_manifestation":"Affected infants typically present with hypotonia, areflexia, and progressive motor weakness. SMA types range from I (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, most severe) to IV (adult onset). Carriers are asymptomatic. Unaffected non-carriers have two functional alleles and normal SMN protein levels. The 25% affected probability applies regardless of subtype; specific subtype determination depends on SMN2 copy number and clinical age of onset.","diagnostic_approach":"Molecular genetic testing for SMN1 deletion or mutation is the gold standard. First\u2010tier test is dosage analysis of SMN1 exon 7 by quantitative PCR or MLPA, with ~95\u201399% sensitivity. Parental carrier testing confirms heterozygosity. Prenatal testing via chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis can determine fetal genotype. Pretest probability in known carriers is 50% for being a carrier and 25% for being affected, and post\u2010test counseling is based on these established Mendelian probabilities.","management_principles":"Treatment includes SMN\u2010augmenting therapies (nusinersen, risdiplam) and gene replacement (onasemnogene abeparvovec). Symptomatic care involves respiratory support, nutritional management, and physiotherapy. Genetic counseling informs family planning, prenatal/preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and recurrence risk of 25% per pregnancy for an affected child.","follow_up_guidelines":"Long\u2010term follow-up focuses on motor milestone achievement, respiratory function monitoring, nutritional status, and therapy efficacy. Regular multidisciplinary assessments (neurology, pulmonology, nutrition, physical therapy) are recommended every 3\u20136 months. Surveillance for scoliosis and joint contractures is essential. Genetic counseling revisited for extended family screening.","clinical_pearls":"1. In autosomal recessive conditions like SMA, two carrier parents have a 25% risk of an affected child. 2. Carriers are asymptomatic but carry a 50% chance of passing the mutant allele. 3. SMN2 copy number modulates SMA severity but does not alter inheritance probability. 4. Early diagnosis and treatment initiation improve outcomes\u2014consider newborn screening. 5. Genetic counseling is critical for family planning and recurrence risk assessment.","references":"1.

What is the likely associated factor?","options":["VEGF","LRRK2","\u03b1-synuclein","Parkin"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"VEGF","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A, VEGF. POEMS syndrome (Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and Skin changes) is a paraneoplastic phenomenon driven by a monoclonal plasma cell disorder. Elevated circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are a hallmark of POEMS and correlate with disease activity. Dispenzieri et al. (2003) reported mean VEGF levels > 1,000 pg/mL in active POEMS versus < 200 pg/mL in controls, with sensitivity 85% and specificity 90% for diagnosis. Options B, C, and D are genes/proteins linked to Parkinson disease (LRRK2), synucleinopathies (\u03b1-synuclein), and autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (Parkin), none of which are associated with edema or polyneuropathy in POEMS.","conceptual_foundation":"POEMS syndrome is classified under ICD-11 4A44 (\u2018Paraneoplastic polyneuropathy associated with plasma cell dyscrasia\u2019). It represents a monoclonal gammopathy with endoneurial microvascular injury. The differential includes CIDP, AL amyloidosis, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, and light-chain deposition disease. Historically distinguished from CIDP by organomegaly, endocrinopathy, and skin changes, POEMS was first described in the 1980s with recognition of VEGF\u2019s central role emerging in the 2000s. The neuropathy is a mixed demyelinating\u2013axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy predominantly affecting lower limbs.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, VEGF regulates endothelial proliferation and vascular permeability. In POEMS, a monoclonal plasma cell clone secretes excessive VEGF, leading to microvascular leak, endoneurial edema, and nerve ischemia. This drives demyelination and axonal loss via hypoxia, inflammatory cell recruitment, and complement activation. Chronically elevated VEGF also underlies organomegaly (splenic and hepatic), capillary leak resulting in peripheral edema, and skin changes (hyperpigmentation, hemangiomas).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with symmetric distal sensorimotor neuropathy (numbness, paresthesias, weakness) often progressing over months. Lower limb pitting edema and ascites are common, seen in > 90% of cases. Organomegaly (splenomegaly > 70%), endocrinopathies (hypogonadism, hypothyroidism), monoclonal \u03bb-light chain spike, and skin findings (hyperpigmentation, glomeruloid hemangiomas) complete the syndrome. Neuropathy is often painful and refractory to standard CIDP regimens.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line tests: serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, free light-chain assay, quantitative VEGF level, nerve conduction studies, and bone marrow biopsy. Elevated VEGF (> 600 pg/mL) supports diagnosis (AAN guideline, Level B). Nerve conduction shows demyelination with reduced conduction velocity (< 40 m/s) and prolonged distal latencies. MRI spine may reveal sclerotic bone lesions. PET\u2013CT can localize plasmacytoma foci.","management_principles":"Treatment targets the plasma cell clone. Localized disease: radiation of plasmacytoma. Diffuse bone marrow involvement: lenalidomide plus dexamethasone or high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplant. Anti-VEGF therapy (bevacizumab) has been used off-label. Supportive: diuretics for edema, physiotherapy for neuropathy. Response correlates with VEGF decline (90% reduction at 6 months predicts remission).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor VEGF levels and monoclonal protein every 3 months in the first year, then biannually. Repeat nerve conduction studies at 6 and 12 months. Screen for endocrinopathies annually. Imaging (PET\u2013CT or skeletal survey) at 12 months to detect new lesions. Taper supportive therapies as VEGF normalizes.","clinical_pearls":"1. VEGF elevation is both diagnostic and prognostic in POEMS\u2014levels > 1,000 pg/mL suggest active disease. 2. Neuropathy in POEMS mimics CIDP but is refractory to IVIG or plasmapheresis alone. 3. Skin hemangiomas in POEMS often precede neuropathy and should prompt VEGF testing. 4. Splenomegaly with monoclonal \u03bb chain spike strongly favors POEMS over other gammopathies. 5. Stem cell transplant offers the best long-term remission rates (~80% 5-year survival).","references":"1. Dispenzieri A, et al. Blood. 2003;101(7):2496\u20132506. doi:10.1182/blood-2002-09-2797  2.

What investigation will be most helpful?","options":["Acylcarnitine profile","Lactate/pyruvate profile","Thymidine level"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Lactate/pyruvate profile","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most helpful initial biochemical investigation in a patient with suspected mitochondrial disorder is the measurement of plasma lactate and pyruvate levels, and calculation of the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. Elevated lactate reflects impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio (>20) indicates a block at or distal to complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Finsterer et al., 2020). Option A, acylcarnitine profile, is primarily used to detect disorders of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation (e.g., medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) rather than primary mitochondrial respiratory chain defects (Chace et al., 2016). Option C, thymidine level, is specific for mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) due to thymidine phosphorylase deficiency and is not broadly applicable to the majority of mitochondrial disorders (Nishino et al., 1999). Thus, option B is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Mitochondrial disorders are a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases affecting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. They follow various inheritance patterns including maternal (mtDNA) and Mendelian (nuclear DNA) modes. Mitochondrial function is pivotal for ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation. Impaired respiratory chain complexes lead to reduced ATP synthesis and increased reliance on anaerobic glycolysis, causing lactate accumulation. The lactate/pyruvate ratio helps localize the defect: a high ratio suggests complex I or III/IV dysfunction; a normal ratio with elevated lactate suggests pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Clinically, patients present with multi-system involvement, often with neuromuscular, cardiac, and hepatic manifestations. Differential diagnoses include fatty acid oxidation defects, glycogen storage diseases, and pyruvate metabolism disorders.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, pyruvate generated by glycolysis enters mitochondria and is decarboxylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase to acetyl-CoA, entering the Krebs cycle. Electrons transferred through complexes I\u2013IV generate a proton gradient to drive ATP synthase. In mitochondrial respiratory chain defects, electron flow is reduced, ATP generation declines, and NADH accumulates. The increased NADH/NAD+ ratio shifts pyruvate to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase, elevating lactate levels. The lactate/pyruvate ratio rises because pyruvate cannot be effectively utilized by mitochondria. In contrast, fatty acid oxidation defects (option A) lead to accumulation of specific acylcarnitine species, and thymidine phosphorylase deficiency (option C) causes thymidine and deoxyuridine accumulation with secondary mitochondrial DNA damage.","clinical_manifestation":"Mitochondrial disorders present with variable symptoms: exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, lactic acidosis, neuropathy, stroke\u2010like episodes, cardiomyopathy, hearing loss, diabetes, and hepatic dysfunction. The onset can occur at any age. Leigh syndrome, MELAS, and MERRF are classic syndromes. In MELAS, stroke\u2010like episodes and seizures accompany lactic acidosis. In contrast, fatty acid oxidation defects present in infancy with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and cardiomyopathy. MNGIE manifests with gastrointestinal dysmotility and peripheral neuropathy. Elevated plasma lactate is seen in ~80% of mitochondrial disease patients (McCormick et al., 2018).","diagnostic_approach":"First-line investigations for suspected mitochondrial disease include plasma lactate and pyruvate levels (Grade B recommendation, Elliott et al., 2008). A lactate/pyruvate ratio >20 has a sensitivity of ~70% and specificity of ~80% for mitochondrial respiratory chain defects (Haas et al., 2007). Second-tier tests include neuroimaging (MRI: basal ganglia signal changes), muscle biopsy with histochemistry (ragged\u2010red fibers, COX-negative fibers), and respiratory chain enzyme assays. Genetic testing with mtDNA sequencing and nuclear panel offers definitive diagnosis. Acylcarnitine profile is indicated if fatty acid oxidation defect is suspected. Thymidine levels are measured when MNGIE is considered.","management_principles":"Management is largely supportive and symptom-targeted. For lactic acidosis, supplementation with cofactors such as thiamine (100\u2013300 mg/day) and riboflavin (100\u2013400 mg/day) may enhance residual enzyme activity. Dichloroacetate has been trialed to lower lactate but with limited benefit and risk of neuropathy. Exercise therapy can improve mitochondrial biogenesis. Specific disorders (e.g., coenzyme Q10 deficiency) respond to coenzyme Q10 supplementation (5\u201330 mg/kg/day). MNGIE may benefit from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to restore thymidine phosphorylase activity (Hirano et al., 2006).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor plasma lactate and pyruvate quarterly to assess metabolic control. Annual cardiac evaluation (echocardiogram, ECG) for cardiomyopathy. Regular audiology for hearing loss. Ophthalmologic evaluation for pigmentary retinopathy. Annual neuropsychological assessment in pediatric patients. Adjust surveillance based on organ involvement. Early intervention in metabolic crises with intravenous glucose and avoidance of fasting is critical.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always obtain lactate and pyruvate together; the ratio localizes the defect. 2. A non\u2010invasive genetic panel can avoid muscle biopsy in many cases. 3. Normal lactate does not exclude mitochondrial disease\u2014up to 20% have normal resting levels. 4. Elevated acylcarnitine profile directs to fatty acid oxidation defects, not primary mitochondrial disease. 5. Thymidine levels are specific for MNGIE; consider only with GI dysmotility and neuropathy.","references":"1. Finsterer J, Zarrouk-Mahjoub S.

Low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation demonstrates a characteristic decremental response in compound muscle action potential amplitudes in approximately 75\u201380% of generalized MG patients and 30\u201350% of ocular MG patients (Sanders et al. 1998; Heckmann 2013). Anti-AChR antibody testing has ~85% sensitivity in generalized MG and ~50% in ocular MG (Meriggioli 2009), while anti-MuSK antibodies account for only 5\u20138% of all cases (Gilhus 2016). The term \"small fiber EMG\" (Option A) refers to evaluation of small fiber neuropathies, not neuromuscular junction disorders. Option B is incorrect because no anti-cholinesterase antibody exists; cholinesterase inhibitors target the enzyme, not the immune system. Option C (anti-MuSK antibody) is specific but has low sensitivity due to low prevalence. Common misconceptions include conflating antibody specificity with overall test sensitivity. Level A evidence from cohort studies and practice guidelines supports low-frequency RNS as a first-tier electrophysiological test.","conceptual_foundation":"Myasthenia Gravis is an acquired autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction characterized by pathogenic autoantibodies directed against postsynaptic components. In ICD-11, MG is classified under 8B60 (autoimmune disorders of neuromuscular junction). The predominant autoantibody targets are the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in 80\u201385% of generalized cases, with smaller subsets having antibodies to muscle-specific kinase (MuSK, ~5\u20138%) or LRP4 (~2\u20133%) (Gilhus 2016). MG embodies a Type II hypersensitivity mechanism: IgG antibodies bind to their targets, activate complement, and induce receptor internalization or functional blockade. Differential diagnoses include Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (presynaptic P/Q-type VGCC antibodies), congenital myasthenic syndromes (genetic NMJ protein defects), and other neuromuscular diseases. Historically described by Samuel Goldflam in 1893 and immunopathologically defined in the 1970s, MG illustrates the intersection of immunology, molecular neurobiology, and clinical neurology. Embryological development of the NMJ involves agrin-MuSK signaling for AChR clustering, a process disrupted in MuSK-positive MG cases. Understanding MG requires integration of immunogenetics, receptor biology, and neuromuscular physiology.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, an action potential reaches the motor nerve terminal, opening voltage-gated calcium channels, triggering acetylcholine (ACh) release into the synaptic cleft. ACh binds nicotinic ACh receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, causing sodium influx, end-plate potential generation, and muscle fiber depolarization (Sellin 2009). In MG, IgG1 and IgG3 autoantibodies against AChR induce receptor cross-linking, internalization, and complement-mediated membrane damage via C5b-9 complexes, reducing receptor density by >50% and lowering the safety factor for neuromuscular transmission (Meriggioli 2009). Anti-MuSK (IgG4) antibodies disrupt agrin-MuSK-LRP4 signaling, preventing AChR clustering. Repeated stimulation exhausts compensatory ACh release, leading to decremental responses in RNS and increased jitter on single-fiber EMG. Over time, secondary simplification of postjunctional folds further impairs transmission. The molecular cascade\u2014from autoantibody binding to synaptic dysfunction\u2014explains fatigability and the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors in prolonging ACh availability.","clinical_manifestation":"MG typically presents with fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness that worsens with exertion and improves with rest (Gilhus 2016). Ocular symptoms (ptosis, diplopia) occur in ~50% at onset; 20% remain purely ocular. Bulbar involvement (dysphagia, dysarthria) affects ~30\u201350%, limb and axial weakness ~60\u201370%, and respiratory muscle weakness precipitates crisis in ~15\u201320% (Sanders 2016). Physical exam may reveal Peek sign, Cogan lid twitch, and a positive ice pack test (sensitivity ~80%). Deep tendon reflexes are preserved. Weakness often worsens at day\u2019s end or after repetitive use. Subtypes include early-onset (<50 years, female predominance) and late-onset (>50 years, male) MG. Without treatment, weakness progressively impairs function over months to years, with potential respiratory failure. Special populations (pregnant women, children) may exhibit variable presentations and immunologic profiles.","diagnostic_approach":"A tiered diagnostic approach begins with clinical suspicion followed by electrophysiological and serological tests (AAN 2016). First-tier: low-frequency (2\u20135 Hz) RNS demonstrating \u226510% decrement in CMAP amplitude (sensitivity ~75\u201380%, specificity ~85%) and single-fiber EMG showing increased jitter (sensitivity >95%, specificity ~80%). Second-tier: antibody assays\u2014anti-AChR radioimmunoassay (85% sensitivity generalized, 50% ocular; specificity >99%), anti-MuSK and anti-LRP4 for seronegative patients (~5\u20138% and ~2\u20133% respectively). Edrophonium test yields rapid improvement in ~90% but carries cardiac risks. Imaging (CT/MRI) of chest to detect thymoma (~10\u201315%) is recommended. Pretest probability guides test selection; in high-suspicion cases, negative RNS warrants SFEMG. Historical EDX tests (e.g., repetitive burst stimulation) have been supplanted by RNS and SFEMG for superior accuracy.","management_principles":"Treatment aims at symptomatic relief, immunomodulation, and thymus management (Sanders 2016; AAN 2016). Symptomatic: pyridostigmine 60 mg q4\u20136h (up to 240 mg/day; NNT 2.5; cholinergic side effects). Immunosuppression: corticosteroids (prednisone starting 10\u201320 mg daily, titrated to 60\u201380 mg; onset 4\u20138 weeks) and steroid-sparing agents (azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day; 60% remission at 2 years; mycophenolate mofetil 1\u20133 g/day). Acute exacerbations/myasthenic crisis: plasmapheresis (5 exchanges/7\u201310 days) or IVIG (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days) for rapid improvement. Thymectomy is indicated in thymomatous MG and in non-thymomatous generalized MG <60 years, yielding 30\u201350% remission at 2\u20133 years. Refractory cases may benefit from rituximab or eculizumab. Avoid MG-exacerbating drugs (aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, magnesium).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes periodic assessment every 3\u20136 months using MGFA Clinical Classification and MG-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scores, and FVC measurements for bulbar/respiratory involvement (MGFA 2020). Monitor CBC and liver enzymes quarterly for patients on azathioprine. Repeat chest imaging (CT/MRI) biennially in thymoma cases. Taper steroids after \u22656 months of stable remission while monitoring for relapse. Incorporate physical and occupational therapy for strength and fatigue management. Vaccinate against influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Educate patients on early crisis signs, medication compliance, and avoidance of precipitating factors. Lifelong multidisciplinary follow-up is essential, as 10\u201320% may experience relapse.","clinical_pearls":"1. Single-fiber EMG is the single most sensitive test (>95%) for MG; use it when RNS is inconclusive. 2. Thymectomy improves remission rates even in non-thymomatous MG patients <60 years; consider early referral. 3. Bulbar and respiratory symptoms portend higher risk of myasthenic crisis; monitor FVC and negative inspiratory force closely. 4. Edrophonium test has high sensitivity but can cause bradyarrhythmias; have atropine ready and monitor ECG. 5. The ice pack test (two minutes on eyelid) is a simple bedside maneuver with ~80% sensitivity for ocular MG, aiding rapid diagnosis.","references":"1. Meriggioli MR, Sanders DB.
