[{"question_number":"1","question":"Which of the following agents can cause sensory ataxia, vibration, and proprioception loss?","options":["Pyridoxine","Arsenic","Lead","Mercury"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Pyridoxine","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A, pyridoxine, is correct. Excessive vitamin B6 intake (commonly >200 mg/day for prolonged periods) leads to a sensory-dominant peripheral neuropathy characterized by large-fiber dysfunction, manifesting as impaired vibration and proprioception and resultant sensory ataxia. In a landmark case series, Kornbluth et al. (1999) reported 16 patients who developed stocking-glove sensory loss after chronic high-dose pyridoxine supplementation, with nerve conduction studies showing absent sensory nerve action potentials. Option B, arsenic, produces a painful sensorimotor neuropathy with small-fiber involvement and gastrointestinal symptoms, not isolated large-fiber sensory ataxia. Option C, lead, causes motor neuropathy (wrist drop) via demyelination and axonal degeneration of motor fibers, sparing sensation. Option D, mercury, primarily induces central nervous system toxicity (tremor, excitability) and gingivostomatitis, not a pure large-fiber neuropathy. Thus, pyridoxine toxicity uniquely fits the clinical triad of sensory ataxia, vibration, and proprioception loss.","conceptual_foundation":"Peripheral neuropathies are classified anatomically (mononeuropathy, polyneuropathy, plexopathy), by fiber type (large vs. small fibers), and pathologically (axonal vs. demyelinating). Large myelinated fibers (A\u03b2) subserve vibration and proprioception; injury leads to sensory ataxia. B6 (pyridoxine) is a cofactor in neurotransmitter synthesis but in excess causes dorsal root ganglion neuronal apoptosis. Heavy metals and toxins produce distinct neuropathic patterns: arsenic yields sensorimotor small-fiber neuropathy, lead causes motor neuropathy, mercury targets CNS. Understanding these classifications is key for toxic neuropathy diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"Pyridoxine toxicity results from prolonged high-dose intake causing intracellular accumulation in dorsal root ganglion neurons, leading to disruption of neuronal calcium homeostasis and apoptosis. This selectively affects large myelinated dorsal root ganglion cells, impairing conduction along the dorsal columns. Pathologically, nerves show fiber loss without demyelination. In contrast, arsenic disrupts mitochondrial function in small fibers, lead inhibits Na+/K+ ATPase in motor fibers, and mercury binds sulfhydryl groups in CNS neurons.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present after weeks to months of high-dose B6 supplementation with symmetrical paresthesias, sensory ataxia, positive Romberg sign, and loss of vibration/proprioception in a stocking-glove distribution. Motor strength is typically preserved. Symptoms may progress proximally. Time to onset averages 6 months. Physical exam reveals sensory ataxic gait and joint position deficits; reflexes are often reduced.","diagnostic_approach":"History of vitamin B6 ingestion is critical. Nerve conduction studies show absent or reduced SNAP amplitudes with normal motor conduction. EMG is normal in muscles. Laboratory assays of serum pyridoxine levels confirm toxicity. First-tier testing: NCS/EMG (sensitivity ~90%). Second-tier: B6 serum levels. Third-tier: nerve biopsy rarely required.","management_principles":"Discontinue pyridoxine immediately. Recovery of large-fiber function occurs over months; early identification reduces permanent deficits. Supportive therapy includes physical rehabilitation. No specific antidote exists. First-tier: cessation of vitamin. Second-tier: symptomatic management (gabapentin for paresthesia). Third-tier: neuroprotective agents under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow patient monthly with neurological exam and NCS every 3 months to document reinnervation. Recovery begins within 1 month of cessation; complete recovery by 6\u201312 months in most. Persisting deficits beyond 12 months may be permanent.","clinical_pearls":"1. High-dose pyridoxine causes large-fiber sensory neuropathy with dorsal column signs. 2. Sensory action potentials are selectively reduced; motor conduction remains normal. 3. Dose threshold ~200 mg/day for months. 4. Early recognition prevents irreversible neuropathy. 5. Romberg test is highly sensitive (~85%) for dorsal column dysfunction.","references":"1.

Mees lines, transverse white lines on the fingernails (transverse leukonychia), are a classic sign of acute arsenic poisoning. They reflect temporary disruption of nail matrix keratinization 2\u20133 weeks after exposure. Option B, lead, causes blue lines at the gums (Burton\u2019s lines) and motor neuropathy, not Mees lines. Option C, carbon monoxide, manifests with cherry-red skin and neurological sequelae but no nail lines. Option D, alcohol, may cause Beau\u2019s lines due to systemic illness, but Mees lines are specific for arsenic and a few other heavy metals like thallium.","conceptual_foundation":"Nail changes are biomarkers of systemic toxicity. Leukonychia can be transverse (Mees lines) or horizontal depressions (Beau\u2019s lines). Mees lines were first described in 1919 in victims of arsenic trioxide. Recognizing these findings requires understanding the keratinization process in the nail matrix and the timing of insults. Differential diagnoses include other heavy metals (thallium, cyanide), systemic infections, and chemotherapy-induced changes.","pathophysiology":"Arsenic inhibits sulfhydryl-containing enzymes in keratinocytes, interrupting mitotic activity in the nail matrix. This leads to abnormal keratin formation producing transverse white bands. As nails grow (~3 mm/month), the lines migrate distally over weeks. No structural weakness occurs as in Beau\u2019s lines, which are depressions.","clinical_manifestation":"Mees lines appear 2\u20133 weeks post-arsenic exposure. They are white, non-blanching transverse bands across the nail plate. Patients often have accompanying symptoms: gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea), cardiovascular (QT prolongation), and neuropathy (sensorimotor). Other nail findings include Beau\u2019s lines and Pembrooke\u2013Fayet sign.","diagnostic_approach":"Physical exam identifying Mees lines should prompt arsenic testing. First-tier: 24-hour urine arsenic speciation (sensitivity ~95%). Second-tier: blood arsenic levels. Third-tier: hair and nail arsenic analysis for chronic exposure. Electrolytes, ECG (QT interval), and Holter monitor can detect cardiotoxicity.","management_principles":"Acute arsenic poisoning requires chelation with dimercaprol (British Anti-Lewisite) or DMSA within hours of exposure to reduce mortality. Supportive care includes IV fluids, electrolyte correction, and cardiac monitoring.

Mees lines are pathognomonic for arsenic when seen with other toxicity signs. 2. Appear 2\u20133 weeks after exposure and progress distally at nail growth rate (~3 mm/month). 3. Differentiate from Beau\u2019s lines (nail depression). 4. Always assess for cardiotoxicity (QT prolongation). 5. Chelation should start ASAP to prevent mortality.","references":"1. Mees CT.

Which of the following agents can cause it?","options":["INH","Ethambutol","Pyrazinamide","All of the above"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"INH","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Isoniazid (INH) is well known to cause seizures by inducing pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency, which impairs GABA synthesis and lowers the seizure threshold. Ethambutol and pyrazinamide do not have significant neurotoxic effects leading to seizures under usual dosing. The mechanism for INH\u2010induced seizures is dose\u2010dependent and related to competitive inhibition of pyridoxal kinase, leading to depletion of the active B6 coenzyme required for glutamic acid decarboxylase. Prophylactic pyridoxine supplementation is recommended during INH therapy to prevent this complication.","conceptual_foundation":"INH\u2019s neurotoxicity arises from its chemical structure that chelates pyridoxal phosphate and prevents its conversion to active pyridoxine, a required cofactor for GABA synthesis in the central nervous system. GABA, the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter, becomes deficient, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability. INH also crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier readily, increasing central nervous system exposure. In contrast, ethambutol targets the mycobacterial arabinosyl transferase and pyrazinamide disrupts mycobacterial membrane energetics but neither interferes with human neurotransmitter metabolism.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, pyridoxal phosphate serves as a cofactor for glutamic acid decarboxylase, which converts glutamate to GABA. INH binds to pyridoxal phosphate, forming an inactive hydrazone complex, reducing GABA synthesis. Neurons in cortex and hippocampus exhibit increased excitatory discharge, manifesting as generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures. Chronic depletion can also cause peripheral neuropathy, but the acute effect on GABA is responsible for seizures.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients on high-dose INH or with poor nutritional status present with new-onset generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures, often without focal signs. Seizures typically occur within days to weeks of therapy initiation. Associated features may include confusion, irritability, and peripheral neuropathy. Without pyridoxine rescue, status epilepticus can develop.","diagnostic_approach":"Consider INH toxicity in any patient on anti-TB therapy with seizures. Measure plasma B6 levels, though clinical response to empiric pyridoxine (100 mg IV) is diagnostic. EEG may show generalized epileptiform discharges. Rule out other causes (electrolyte disturbances, CNS infection).","management_principles":"Immediate administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) 1 g IV per gram of INH ingested is recommended to rapidly restore GABA synthesis. Supportive care includes benzodiazepines for seizure control and airway protection. INH should be held until toxicity resolves, then reintroduced with high-dose B6 prophylaxis.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for recurrent seizures and signs of neuropathy. Ensure daily pyridoxine supplementation (10\u201350 mg) for the duration of INH therapy. Periodic assessment of neurologic status and nutritional support is advised.","clinical_pearls":["Always co-prescribe pyridoxine with INH to prevent seizures and neuropathy.","Seizures in INH toxicity respond dramatically to IV pyridoxine; failure to improve suggests alternative etiology.","High-risk populations include malnourished patients, those with HIV, and alcoholics.","EEG in INH toxicity shows diffuse slowing and generalized spikes\u2014non\u2010specific but supportive.","Ethambutol and pyrazinamide rarely cause seizures; consider optic neuritis for ethambutol and hepatotoxicity for pyrazinamide."],"references":["1.

In severe arsenic poisoning, prompt administration of chelators such as dimercaprol (British Anti-Lewisite, BAL) or dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is recommended to bind arsenic and promote urinary excretion (Flora et al., 2012). Supportive care (A) alone is insufficient because arsenic\u2019s high affinity for sulfhydryl groups leads to multi-organ toxicity; anticonvulsants (C) and corticosteroids (D) have no specific role in arsenic chelation and do not reduce arsenic tissue burden. Common misconceptions include believing that steroids might attenuate arsenic-induced inflammation, but no trials support this practice. Level A evidence from toxicology guidelines endorses BAL or DMSA as first-line therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Arsenic is a metalloid that exists in trivalent and pentavalent forms. It inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and disrupts cellular respiration by binding lipoic acid. Accidental or occupational exposure can lead to acute poisoning characterized by gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and dermatologic manifestations. In ICD-11, arsenic poisoning is coded under toxic effects of metals (6B81). Differential diagnoses include other heavy metal poisonings (lead, mercury) and organophosphate ingestion. Historically, BAL was developed during World War II as an antidote to arsenic-based chemical warfare agents.","pathophysiology":"Normal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation requires pyruvate dehydrogenase. Arsenic binds to lipoic acid, a cofactor for this enzyme, halting ATP production and causing cellular hypoxia. Trivalent arsenic also generates reactive oxygen species, disrupting membrane integrity. Neuronal tissue, highly dependent on aerobic metabolism, undergoes axonal degeneration leading to peripheral neuropathy. The chelator BAL contains vicinal sulfhydryl groups that competitively bind arsenic, forming a complex excreted in urine. Without chelation, tissue deposition persists and organ damage progresses.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute severe arsenic poisoning presents within hours with profuse vomiting, watery diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, QT prolongation, and encephalopathy. A sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy emerges after days to weeks, with stocking-glove distribution. Dermatologic features include Mee\u2019s lines and hyperkeratosis in chronic exposure. In untreated cases, multi-organ failure and death occur within days. Survivors may develop chronic skin changes and neuropathy that persist for years.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: measure total and speciated arsenic in urine within 24\u2009h of exposure (sensitivity >90%, specificity >95%) (Arias et al., 2017). Blood arsenic peaks early and is less reliable after 48\u2009h. Second-tier: hair and nail arsenic quantification for chronic exposure. ECG monitoring for QT prolongation is essential. Pretest probability is high in industrial or contaminated-water exposures. In resource-limited settings, urinary arsenic can be approximated by colorimetric tests, though with lower specificity (~75%).","management_principles":"Immediate decontamination and supportive care are essential. First-line: dimercaprol 3\u20135\u2009mg/kg IM every 4\u2009h for 2\u2009days, then every 6\u2009h for 10\u2009days (Class I, Level A). Alternative: DMSA 10\u2009mg/kg PO every 8\u2009h for 5\u2009days, then every 12\u2009h for 14\u2009days (Class I, Level B). Monitor renal and hepatic function during therapy. There is no role for corticosteroids or anticonvulsants unless seizures occur secondary to encephalopathy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor urinary arsenic excretion weekly until levels normalize. Assess renal and hepatic panels every 3\u2009days during chelation and monthly for 3\u2009months. Neurologic exam monthly for 6\u2009months to detect late neuropathy. Repeat ECGs until QTc returns to baseline. Provide occupational counseling to prevent re-exposure.","clinical_pearls":"1. BAL must be administered before British Anti-Lewisite is cleared; delay reduces efficacy. 2. DMSA is less painful and oral. 3. QT prolongation correlates with mortality risk. 4.
