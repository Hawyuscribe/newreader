[{"question_number":"3","question":"A 70-something female with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, fully independent, presents with a 90-minute onset of dense right hemiparesis and aphasia. A computed tomography (CT) brain scan performed 30 minutes after arrival shows no hemorrhage. As her symptoms slightly improved on the way to the ER, what should be done next?","options":["IV tPA","CT angiogram"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"IV tPA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (IV tPA): Intravenous alteplase administered at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) with 10% as bolus and the remainder over 60 minutes is the guideline\u2010recommended therapy for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of onset. Multiple randomized controlled trials, including NINDS (1995) and ECASS III (2008), demonstrated a 30% relative increase in favorable 90-day functional outcome (mRS 0\u20131) and absolute 12%\u201316% reduction in disability when given within 3 to 4.5 hours. Current AHA/ASA guidelines grant a Class I, Level A recommendation. Pathophysiologically, alteplase restores perfusion by converting plasminogen to plasmin and lysing fibrin. Common misconception: waiting for vascular imaging delays treatment and worsens penumbral loss. Option B (CT angiogram): While CT angiography (CTA) is critical to identify large\u2010vessel occlusion and guide endovascular thrombectomy, it is not the immediate next step when IV tPA eligibility is clear and there is no contraindication. CTA may be obtained shortly after alteplase if planning EVT. A scenario favoring upfront CTA would be wake-up stroke presenting outside tPA window but within 6 hours for EVT. Option C (Endovascular thrombectomy alone): Mechanical thrombectomy is indicated for large\u2010vessel occlusion within 6 hours (Class I), but only after IV tPA if within window. Without confirmatory angiographic imaging and prior tPA, immediate thrombectomy alone is not standard. Option D (Aspirin 325 mg PO): Aspirin initiation is recommended 24\u201348 hours after stroke onset if no hemorrhage, but aspirin alone is insufficient in the hyperacute phase. Delaying reperfusion therapy in favor of antiplatelets increases infarct volume by 1\u20132 mL per minute and worsens outcomes. In summary, the definitive correct choice is A\u2014IV tPA within the therapeutic window with no hemorrhage or major contraindications.","conceptual_foundation":"The right middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution supplies the lateral frontal lobe (including Broca\u2019s area in the dominant hemisphere), lateral parietal lobe, and internal capsule. In this patient with dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, left cortical and subcortical structures are implicated. The internal capsule\u2019s posterior limb carries corticospinal fibers; lesions here cause contralateral pure motor hemiparesis. Embryologically, the MCA arises from the anterior cerebral artery at approximately Carnegie stage 12 and undergoes branching by week 8. A collateral network via leptomeningeal anastomoses provides limited compensation in proximal occlusion. Normal physiology depends on an autoregulatory range of mean arterial pressure between 60 and 150 mm Hg, maintaining cerebral blood flow at ~50 mL/100 g/min. When flow drops below 20 mL/100 g/min, electrical failure ensues; under 10 mL/100 g/min, infarction occurs. Historical evolution of acute stroke care began with Fisher\u2019s 1951 description of stroke syndromes, advancing to Fenestration trials in 1995 that validated IV tPA, followed by thrombectomy trials in 2015 expanding the treatment window. Key landmarks include the Sylvian fissure demarcating MCA territory and the insular ribbon on CT as an early ischemic sign. Understanding vascular territories and collateral potential underlies all hyperacute management decisions.","pathophysiology":"Acute ischemic stroke initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular events. Occlusion of a cerebral artery causes energy failure due to ATP depletion, leading to Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase dysfunction and cellular depolarization. Voltage-gated Ca\u00b2\u207a channels open, increasing intracellular calcium and activating proteases (calpains), endonucleases, and lipases, resulting in membrane degradation. Glutamate excitotoxicity propagates injury via NMDA and AMPA receptor overactivation, further amplifying Ca\u00b2\u207a influx. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) contribute to lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Microglial activation releases proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and matrix metalloproteinases that disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier, permitting leukocyte infiltration. Genetic predisposition includes polymorphisms in PON1 (paraoxonase) and genes regulating coagulation such as Factor V Leiden increasing thrombosis risk. Metabolically, anaerobic glycolysis yields lactic acidosis, further endangering penumbral tissue. The core infarct develops within minutes, while the penumbra remains salvageable for up to 4.5 hours. Endogenous fibrinolysis, involving tissue plasminogen activator release from endothelial cells, attempts spontaneous clot lysis but at a rate of only 1%\u20135% per hour without intervention. Collateral perfusion via circle of Willis and leptomeningeal vessels may extend the window by preserving penumbral viability, but is highly variable between individuals.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in an anterior circulation stroke typically evolves rapidly. At 0\u201315 minutes, patients notice sudden limb weakness, facial droop, and slurred speech. By 15\u201360 minutes, dense hemiparesis with muscle strength graded 0\u20132/5 emerges, and expressive or global aphasia manifests if the dominant hemisphere is affected. Neurological examination reveals an upper motor neuron pattern: brisk deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar response, and facial involvement sparing the forehead ipsilaterally. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores above 15 correlate with large infarcts. In elderly patients, comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension may blunt sympathetic responses and delay recognition. Pediatric strokes differ; focal deficits are less common, and seizures occur in up to 50%. Women sometimes present with atypical symptoms such as headache, dizziness, or altered mental status. Associated systemic signs include elevated blood pressure (often >180/100 mm Hg), hyperglycemia (glucose >140 mg/dL), and stress leukocytosis. Without reperfusion, neurological deficits reach peak severity within 6\u201312 hours, and infarct maturation completes by 72 hours, often resulting in fixed deficits. Red flags include rapid deterioration indicating hemorrhagic transformation or malignant cerebral edema. Early recognition and grading using scales like NIHSS guide acute management and prognosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Upon presentation within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, immediate noncontrast CT has a sensitivity of 95% for hemorrhage exclusion and specificity of 75% for early ischemic changes. If no hemorrhage is detected, labs including CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, blood glucose, electrolytes, renal function, and troponin must return within 45 minutes. Point-of-care glucose ensures hypoglycemia (<60 mg/dL) is excluded. The decision algorithm follows: (1) confirm stroke signs and last known normal; (2) perform noncontrast CT; (3) review labs for tPA contraindications (e.g., INR >1.7, platelets <100 \u00d710\u2079/L); (4) if CTA is planned for thrombectomy, it can be performed immediately after CT but should not delay tPA. MRI DWI has 85% sensitivity for hyperacute infarct but takes longer (20\u201330 minutes) and often is not feasible emergently. Carotid ultrasound and echocardiography are second-line once acute therapy is initiated, to evaluate for carotid stenosis (>70%) and cardiac sources such as atrial fibrillation or mural thrombus. Transcranial Doppler may identify microembolic signals when other tests are inconclusive. Differential diagnoses include hypoglycemia, seizure with Todd\u2019s paralysis, migraine with aura, and conversion disorder; each distinguished by labs, EEG, and clinical context.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is IV alteplase dosed at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) with 10% given as a bolus over 1 minute and the remainder infused over 60 minutes. Blood pressure should be maintained below 185/110 mm Hg before and below 180/105 mm Hg for the next 24 hours, using labetalol 10\u201320 mg IV or nicardipine infusion at 5 mg/h titrated up by 2.5 mg/h every 5 minutes. After alteplase, avoid antithrombotics for 24 hours. Second-line therapy for large\u2010vessel occlusion on CTA within 6 hours is mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers, achieving recanalization rates of 58% and improved functional independence in 46% of cases (EXTEND-IA trial). Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 325 mg PO) begins at 24\u201348 hours if hemorrhage is excluded. In patients with atrial fibrillation, initiate direct oral anticoagulant after 4\u201314 days based on infarct size. Monitor neurologic status every 15 minutes during infusion, then hourly for 8 hours. For cerebral edema, mannitol 0.5\u20131 g/kg IV or hypertonic saline (3%) may be required. In special populations, reduce alteplase dose by 15% if age >80 years or weight <50 kg is present, though current guidelines do not contraindicate based on age alone.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute hospitalization, patients should return for neurological assessment at 2 weeks to adjust secondary prevention, then at 3 months to evaluate functional recovery and rehabilitation needs. Blood pressure targets are <130/80 mm Hg, LDL <70 mg/dL, and HbA1c <7% in diabetics. Repeat carotid duplex ultrasound is indicated at 6 weeks for stenosis surveillance if initial imaging showed 50%\u201369% narrowing. MRI with DWI or CT perfusion after 3\u20136 months may be considered in recurrent or progressive deficits. Long\u2010term complications include post-stroke epilepsy (incidence 5%\u201310%) and depression (30%). One-year mortality is approximately 20%, and five-year disability rate remains 50%. Early physical, occupational, and speech therapy should begin within 48 hours of admission and continue for at least 3 months. Patient education includes risk factor modification, medication adherence, and recognizing TIA symptoms. Driving may be resumed after 4 weeks if no significant deficits (e.g., hemianopia) and clean neuropsychological testing. Support groups (e.g., American Stroke Association) and community rehabilitation resources should be introduced before discharge.","clinical_pearls":"1. \"Time is brain\": nearly 2 million neurons die per minute of untreated ischemia.  2. tPA window extends to 4.5 hours; every 15 minutes earlier yields 1.8% absolute increase in good outcome.  3.

Both echocardiogram and Holter monitor results are negative. What should be done next?","options":["Neck CTA","Brain MRI"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Neck CTA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Neck CTA) is the most appropriate next step in evaluation after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) of 10 minutes in duration when both echocardiogram and Holter monitoring have excluded a cardioembolic source. The 2014 AHA/ASA secondary prevention guidelines recommend urgent vascular imaging of the extracranial and intracranial arteries\u2014via carotid duplex ultrasound, CT angiography (CTA), or MR angiography (MRA)\u2014to identify stenotic lesions amenable to intervention (Class I, Level A). CTA of the neck has a sensitivity of 90\u201395% and specificity of 92\u201398% for detecting carotid stenosis \u226550% compared to digital subtraction angiography, and can concurrently visualize intracranial vessels with high resolution (Wardlaw et al. Lancet Neurol 2014;13(1):61\u201370). Option B (Brain MRI) is important in TIA workup, particularly diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) which detects infarction in up to 50% of clinically defined TIAs, but it does not evaluate the vascular lumen. Brain MRI is recommended within 24\u201348 hours to confirm tissue injury and exclude mimics (Class I, Level B), yet immediate vascular imaging takes precedence to guide urgent revascularization decisions and secondary prevention strategies.","conceptual_foundation":"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined according to the 2009 AHA/ASA consensus as a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without acute infarction on imaging (Stroke. 2009;40(6):2276\u20132293). In ICD-11, TIAs are coded under 8A00.Z, and they fall within the spectrum of acute cerebrovascular syndromes. Differential diagnoses include migraine aura, focal seizures, hypoglycemia, and peripheral vestibulopathies. Historically, the time\u2010based definition (<24 hours) gave way to a tissue\u2010based definition with the advent of DWI-MRI. Etiologically, TIAs are categorized under TOAST criteria\u2014large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small vessel occlusion, other determined etiology, and undetermined etiology. Carotid atherosclerosis and intracranial stenosis represent large artery sources and are critical to identify early. Embryologically, the carotid arteries derive from the third aortic arch; their intimal integrity and hemodynamic stresses underlie atherosclerotic plaque formation. The circle of Willis provides collateral flow in carotid stenosis, while watershed areas\u2014between anterior and middle cerebral arteries\u2014are vulnerable to hypoperfusion. Understanding these vascular territories guides interpretation of focal deficits and imaging findings.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion depends on intact large and small vessels, autoregulation, and stable cardiac output. In large artery atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction leads to lipid infiltration, inflammatory cell recruitment, smooth muscle proliferation, and fibrous cap formation. Plaque rupture or ulceration may generate microemboli that transiently occlude downstream arterioles, producing focal neurological symptoms that resolve as collaterals reestablish flow. Inflammation within the plaque\u2014mediated by interleukins, matrix metalloproteinases, and macrophages\u2014weakens the fibrous cap, increasing rupture risk. Hemodynamic compromise from high-grade stenosis (>70%) also predisposes to watershed TIAs. Cellularly, ischemia triggers glutamate release, calcium influx, and nitric oxide production, but transient occlusion below the threshold for infarction allows reversal of ionic and metabolic derangements. Temporal evolution in TIA is rapid: symptoms peak within seconds to minutes, then resolve as perfusion is restored. Unlike infarction, there is no persistent cytotoxic edema or blood-brain barrier breakdown detectable on DWI or FLAIR MRI sequences.","clinical_manifestation":"TIAs present with sudden-onset focal neurological deficits lasting minutes to less than one hour. Common symptoms include unilateral motor weakness (40\u201350%), sensory disturbances (30\u201340%), speech disturbances such as aphasia or dysarthria (20\u201330%), and visual symptoms (transient monocular blindness in carotid territory TIAs occurs in 10\u201315%). Symptoms reflect the vascular territory: carotid TIAs often produce motor-sensory or visual deficits, while vertebrobasilar TIAs cause vertigo, ataxia, diplopia, or bilateral symptoms. Prodromal warnings may include limb claudication or fluctuating symptoms. Risk factors mirror those of stroke: hypertension (75%), hyperlipidemia (50%), diabetes (20%), smoking (30%), and atrial fibrillation (10\u201315%). Approximately 10\u201315% of TIAs precede an ischemic stroke within 90 days, half occurring within the first 48 hours. Formal diagnostic criteria emphasize a tissue-based definition: transient neurological dysfunction without imaging evidence of infarction. Controversies include optimal timing of MRI and selection of vascular imaging modality in different healthcare settings.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with ABCD2 score to stratify early stroke risk: Age (\u226560), Blood pressure (\u2265140/90), Clinical features (unilateral weakness, speech disturbance), Duration (\u226560 min, 10\u201359 min), Diabetes. A score \u22654 mandates urgent evaluation. Initial noncontrast CT head excludes hemorrhage or alternative pathology. Within 24\u201348 hours, DWI-MRI is recommended (sensitivity 80\u201390%, specificity 95% for infarction). Concurrent vascular imaging of cervical and intracranial arteries via carotid duplex ultrasound (sensitivity 82%, specificity 88%), CTA (sensitivity 90\u201395%, specificity 92\u201398%), or MRA (sensitivity 84\u201390%, specificity 86\u201396%) is essential to detect stenosis or occlusion. Cardiac evaluation includes ECG, telemetry, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography for cardioembolic sources. Laboratory tests\u2014glucose, lipid profile, CBC, coagulation panel\u2014identify modifiable risk factors. In this patient, negative echo and Holter direct focus to large artery imaging; neck CTA provides rapid, comprehensive assessment to guide revascularization decisions.","management_principles":"Immediate management targets secondary prevention. Antiplatelet therapy: aspirin monotherapy or combined aspirin 81 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg for 21 days in high-risk TIA (CHANCE and POINT trials demonstrated ~30% relative risk reduction, NNT ~60). High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg) lowers recurrent stroke risk by 25\u201345%. Blood pressure control (<140/90 mm Hg) with ACE inhibitors or thiazides is recommended (PROGRESS trial). Lifestyle modifications include smoking cessation, diet, and exercise. In patients with carotid stenosis \u226570% and low surgical risk, carotid endarterectomy within 2 weeks reduces stroke risk by ~50% (NNT ~6 in symptomatic patients; NASCET trial). Carotid artery stenting is considered in select cases (<70 years old or high surgical risk). Glycemic control targets HbA1c <7% in diabetics. Anticoagulation is reserved for atrial fibrillation or hypercoagulable states. Multidisciplinary TIA clinics facilitate rapid evaluation and initiation of therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be followed within 1 week of discharge in specialized TIA clinics for reassessment of vascular imaging, risk factor control, and medication adherence. Repeat carotid ultrasound at 6\u201312 months is indicated in moderate stenosis (50\u201369%) to monitor progression. Blood pressure monitoring every 1\u20133 months until targets are achieved, then every 6 months. Lipid panels at 6\u201312 weeks after statin initiation, then annually. Assess for new cardiac sources with prolonged rhythm monitoring if stroke etiology remains cryptogenic after initial evaluation. Neurocognitive screening considers potential silent infarcts. Monitor for antiplatelet-related bleeding with CBC every 6\u201312 months. Quality-of-life and functional outcome measures, such as the modified Rankin Scale, are assessed at 3 months. Transitional care planning involves educating patients on TIA warning signs and emergency response protocols.","clinical_pearls":"- Perform urgent vascular imaging after cardioembolic sources are excluded to identify revascularization opportunities; high-grade carotid stenosis benefits from prompt endarterectomy.\n- DWI-MRI within 24\u201348 hours confirms tissue injury in TIA but does not replace vascular imaging for etiologic workup.\n- ABCD2 score \u22654 predicts high early stroke risk and mandates expedited evaluation within 24 hours.\n- Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 21 days reduces early recurrence but increases bleeding risk; transition to monotherapy afterward.\n- Carotid endarterectomy within 2 weeks of TIA in symptomatic \u226570% stenosis achieves maximal stroke reduction (NNT ~6).","references":"1.

Venous malformation\n\nThe MRI depicted a classic caput medusae appearance on T2-weighted sequences, characterized by radial orientation of medullary veins converging into a central venous trunk. This finding aligns with developmental venous anomalies (DVAs), a subtype of venous malformation, which represent the most common cerebral vascular malformation detected incidentally. According to Hetts SWF et al. (2015), DVAs appear as dilated medullary veins on T2 with a honeycomb or brush-like configuration, without evidence of nidus or arteriovenous shunting, distinguishing them from arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) which display flow voids and early venous drainage on MRI and catheter angiography [2]. Meta-analyses report a hemorrhage risk in DVAs of less than 0.22% per year, significantly lower than AVMs (2\u20134% per year) [7]. AHA/ASA guidelines (2015) provide Level A evidence advising against intervention in asymptomatic DVAs due to low hemorrhagic risk and potential for venous infarction if disrupted [3].\n\nOption A, Cavernous angioma, and Option D, Cavernous malformation, are synonymous terms referring to clusters of dilated sinusoidal vascular channels with a popcorn appearance and hypointense rim of hemosiderin on gradient echo, which were absent in this case. Susceptibility-weighted imaging sequences are highly sensitive (up to 100%) for cavernous malformations but were negative here [8]. Option C, AVM, is characterized by a nidus of tangled vessels, arterial feeders, and early venous drainage with multiple signal voids; these features were not seen. A common misconception is conflating DVAs with cavernous malformations due to both being venous lesions; however, DVAs lack hemosiderin deposition and acute hemorrhage. Thus, Option B is the most accurate diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Vascular malformations of the central nervous system are categorized by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) into high-flow lesions (e.g., arteriovenous malformations) and low-flow venous malformations (which include developmental venous anomalies or DVAs). Under ICD-11, DVAs fall within Q28.2 (cerebral vascular malformations). Historically, DVAs were termed venous angiomas, reflecting their venous predominance; the term was updated to developmental venous anomaly to emphasize their embryological origin and benign natural history. Embryologically, DVAs arise from arrested development of the medullary venous drainage during the 6th to 8th weeks of gestation, where normal capillary and venous remodeling fails, resulting in retention of primitive medullary veins that converge into a draining vein.\n\nNeuroanatomically, DVAs involve dilated medullary veins within the deep white matter or juxtacortical regions, draining into a superficial or deep collector vein that empties into the dural venous sinuses or deep venous system. The venous network lacks smooth muscle and elastic lamina, distinguishing it from normal veins. Blood flow in DVAs is low velocity and nonshunting, preserving capillary bed integrity downstream. Differential diagnoses include cavernous malformations (popcorn morphology, hemosiderin rim), telangiectasias (tiny punctate vascular channels), and AVMs (high-flow feeders and nidus). Accurate classification informs clinical management: DVAs require surveillance, while AVMs often mandate interventional treatment.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral venous drainage relies on organized medullary veins that channel deoxygenated blood from the capillary bed to pial veins and dural sinuses. In DVAs, aberrant venous remodeling during embryogenesis leads to persistence of dilated medullary veins that fail to regress and instead converge into a central draining vein. These anomalous veins lack a normal capillary network and mature vessel wall architecture, making them susceptible to venous hypertension under stress but generally preserving low-flow dynamics.\n\nMolecularly, DVAs have not been strongly linked to specific genetic mutations, unlike familial cerebral cavernous malformations (KRIT1, CCM2, PDCD10). There is no recognized arteriovenous shunt or high-flow stress, hence the vascular channels do not undergo angiogenesis or remodeling typical of high-flow lesions. Hemodynamic alterations are limited to increased local venous pressure, which can predispose to minor microhemorrhages but rarely cause clinically overt hemorrhage. In contrast, AVMs involve upregulation of angiogenic factors like VEGF, leading to fragile nidus vessels and elevated shear stress with high hemorrhagic potential. Cavernous malformations feature endothelial gap junction abnormalities and hemosiderin deposition from chronic microbleeding. Thus, the pathophysiology of venous malformations explains their benign course and imaging characteristics.","clinical_manifestation":"Most DVAs are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on imaging, comprising up to 60% of all cerebral vascular anomalies. Symptomatic presentations are rare but may include headache, seizures, or focal neurologic deficits if associated with hemorrhage or thrombosis. A systematic review reported an annual hemorrhage rate of 0.15\u20130.22% for DVAs versus 2\u20134% for AVMs [7]. Prodromal symptoms are uncommon; acute headache or new-onset seizures may herald a hemorrhagic event. Lesion location influences presentation: supratentorial DVAs often remain silent, while deep or infratentorial DVAs carry a slightly higher risk of symptomatic complications due to limited compensatory venous reserves.\n\nUntreated DVAs typically remain stable over years; no evidence supports progression to high-flow lesions. Prognostic factors include associated cavernous malformations, which increase hemorrhagic risk to 0.33% per year [1]. Formal diagnostic criteria include the absence of arteriovenous shunting or nidus on angiography and the presence of medullary radicles on MRI. In pediatric populations, DVAs are detected with similar frequency as adults but rarely cause clinical symptoms. Immunocompromised states do not alter the natural history significantly. DVAs in pregnancy do not demonstrate increased hemorrhagic risk according to obstetric registries.","diagnostic_approach":"Imaging is the cornerstone of DVA diagnosis. First-line modality is MRI with T1, T2, and T2* or susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). DVAs appear as linear or brushlike low-signal structures on T2/SWI with a central draining vein; contrast-enhanced T1 reveals the collector vein as a strongly enhancing structure. Sensitivity of SWI for DVAs approaches 100% and specificity is 98% in expert series [8]. Computed tomography with contrast may show enhancing medullary veins but is less sensitive than MRI. Catheter angiography is not routinely required unless AVM is suspected; DVAs demonstrate delayed venous phase filling without early arterial shunting.\n\nPretest probability is high in incidentally detected lesions on MRI. No additional laboratory tests are indicated. In atypical cases or when distinguishing from AVM, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) provides hemodynamic assessment: DVAs show no arteriovenous shunt and normal capillary phase. NNT for DSA in improving diagnostic accuracy over MRI alone is low (<5) in ambiguous cases. Resource-limited settings can rely on contrast CT and noncontrast MRI sequences. Previously, intravenous angiographic techniques were common, but MRI advancements have rendered them obsolete. Future developments include vessel imaging by 7 Tesla MRI providing enhanced venous detail.","management_principles":"Because DVAs carry a low annual hemorrhage risk (<0.22%), conservative management is the cornerstone. AHA/ASA guidelines (2015) recommend observation with periodic clinical assessment (Class I, Level A) [3]. No pharmacologic therapy is indicated. Seizures, when present, are treated per epilepsy guidelines with antiepileptic drugs; there is no evidence that resection of the DVA improves seizure control and may cause venous infarction.\n\nFirst-tier: Observation and symptom management. Analgesics for headache; antiepileptics for seizures with choice based on seizure type. Second-tier: If hemorrhage occurs, supportive neurocritical care and management follow intracranial hemorrhage protocols (blood pressure control, reversal of coagulopathy). Surgical intervention or stereotactic radiosurgery is contraindicated for isolated DVAs due to high risk of venous infarction. Third-tier: Experimental therapies are not indicated. Pregnancy does not alter management; vaginal delivery is safe. Avoid anticoagulation unless medically mandated for unrelated conditions, with close monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up for asymptomatic DVAs consists of clinical evaluation every 12\u201324 months. Routine MRI is not required unless new symptoms develop. If associated cavernous malformation is present, MRI with SWI at 2- to 3-year intervals may be considered to monitor for growth or hemorrhage (Class IIb, Level C) [3]. No guidelines recommend serial angiography. Key prognostic factors include lesion location and presence of associated vascular anomalies. Patient education focuses on recognizing acute headache, focal neurologic signs, or seizures. Transition of care to primary providers with neurology consultation as needed ensures continuity. Long-term outcomes are excellent, with >95% remaining asymptomatic over 10 years. Rehabilitation considerations are minimal in uncomplicated DVAs. Quality of life is typically unaffected.","clinical_pearls":"1.

DVAs have <0.22% annual hemorrhage risk versus 2\u20134% in AVMs; avoid surgical resection to prevent venous infarction.\n3. Associated cavernous malformations increase hemorrhage risk; screen with SWI if mixed lesions are suspected.\n4. No role for catheter angiography in typical DVAs; reserve DSA for cases with suspected high-flow shunting.\n5. Asymptomatic DVAs require only clinical follow-up; new neurologic symptoms warrant MRI, not immediate intervention.","references":"1. Al-Holou WN, et al.

The combination of sudden severe headache, bitemporal hemianopia from optic chiasm compression, and acute drop in hemoglobin indicating intrasellar hemorrhage is classic for pituitary apoplexy. Option A (Carotid cavernous fistula) presents with pulsatile exophthalmos, chemosis, and cranial nerve palsies, not bitemporal field loss or anemia. Option B (Craniopharyngioma with ruptured cyst) can cause headache and chiasmal compression but typically produces aseptic meningitis signs and cyst fluid leakage without hemoglobin drop. Option D (Subarachnoid hemorrhage) causes thunderclap headache and meningeal irritation, without isolated bitemporal hemianopia or sellar hemorrhage.","conceptual_foundation":"Pituitary apoplexy is an acute hemorrhagic infarction of the pituitary gland, often in the setting of a preexisting macroadenoma. In ICD-11 it is classified under \u2018Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases\u2019 (8A40.2). Embryologically, the anterior pituitary arises from Rathke\u2019s pouch; its vascular supply from the superior hypophyseal arteries creates vulnerability to ischemia/hemorrhage. The optic chiasm lies immediately superior to the sella turcica, so expansion of an intrasellar mass causes characteristic bitemporal hemianopia. Key differential diagnoses include aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, sellar masses such as craniopharyngioma, and cavernous sinus vascular lesions. Historically described by Brougham et al in 1950, the term \u201capoplexy\u201d refers to acute intrasellar bleeding leading to rapid expansion within the rigid sella turcica.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the pituitary gland is highly vascular, with the anterior lobe supplied by portal vessels. In pituitary apoplexy, rapid hemorrhage or infarction within a pituitary adenoma causes abrupt pituitary expansion. This intrasellar pressure rise compresses the optic chiasm\u2014producing bitemporal hemianopia\u2014and can extend laterally into the cavernous sinus to affect cranial nerves III, IV, V1/V2, and VI. Hemorrhage into the adenoma leads to a drop in circulating hemoglobin. Acute destruction of pituitary tissue causes sudden loss of ACTH, GH, TSH, and gonadotropins, precipitating adrenal crisis and acute panhypopituitarism. Cellular mechanisms involve necrosis, inflammatory cytokine release, and edema within the confined bony sella.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients almost always present with sudden, excruciating headache, often described as \u2018thunderclap\u2019 in onset but localized to the frontal region. Visual symptoms occur in ~60\u201380% of cases, most commonly bitemporal hemianopia from chiasmal compression; up to 50% develop cranial nerve palsies with ophthalmoplegia. Nausea, vomiting, and altered consciousness can occur. Endocrine signs include hypotension, hyponatremia, and acute secondary adrenal insufficiency. Pituitary apoplexy typically affects adults in their fifth to seventh decades, with no strong sex predilection. Without prompt recognition and treatment, permanent visual loss and life-threatening adrenal crisis may ensue.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial noncontrast head CT detects acute sellar hemorrhage in ~80% of cases and is often performed emergently. MRI of the sellar region is the gold standard: T1\u2010weighted images reveal hyperintense blood products in the pituitary fossa, and sellar enlargement confirms hemorrhage/infarction. Formal visual field testing quantifies chiasmal compression. Baseline endocrine studies should include cortisol, free T4, TSH, LH/FSH, and prolactin. Lumbar puncture is generally avoided unless subarachnoid hemorrhage is strongly suspected and imaging is non\u2010diagnostic. The combination of characteristic clinical features and imaging establishes the diagnosis.","management_principles":"Immediate management centers on hemodynamic stabilization and high\u2010dose intravenous glucocorticoids (e.g., hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q6h) to prevent adrenal crisis. Neurosurgical decompression via transsphenoidal approach is recommended for patients with severe or progressive visual deficits, cranial nerve palsies, or altered mental status. Conservative management with close observation and steroid therapy may be appropriate for milder cases without significant neuro-ophthalmic compromise. Long-term hormone replacement is tailored to persistent pituitary axis deficiencies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-apoplexy patients require ICU monitoring of vital signs, neurologic status, and visual fields. Hormone axis testing is repeated at 6\u20138 weeks to guide long\u2010term replacement of cortisol, thyroid hormone, sex steroids, and GH as needed. MRI of the pituitary at 3\u20136 months assesses for residual adenoma. Lifelong endocrinology follow-up is advised to monitor pituitary function and adjust therapy. Ophthalmology follow\u2010up ensures stabilization or improvement of visual deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always administer stress-dose steroids before definitive neuroimaging if pituitary apoplexy is suspected to prevent adrenal crisis. 2. Bitemporal hemianopia plus acute anemia strongly favors pituitary apoplexy over SAH or meningitis. 3. MRI is more sensitive than CT for subacute to chronic blood products in the pituitary. 4. Early transsphenoidal decompression (within 7 days) yields better visual outcomes. 5. Distinguish pituitary apoplexy from acute meningitis by absence of fever, neck stiffness, and normal CSF.","references":"1. Briet C, Salenave S, Chanson P. Pituitary apoplexy.

Posterior communicating artery. Aneurysms of the posterior communicating artery (PCom) classically compress the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve, leading to a dilated, non-reactive pupil on the side of the lesion. Clinical series demonstrate that up to 75% of patients with PCom aneurysms presenting with oculomotor palsy exhibit pupillary involvement as the initial sign (Han et al. J Neurosurg 2011;115:380\u2013387, doi:10.3171/2011.3.JNS101206). The superficial parasympathetic fibers controlling pupillary constriction lie on the dorsomedial aspect of the oculomotor nerve, rendering them exquisitely vulnerable to external compression by a PCom aneurysm before motor fibers are affected.\n\nOption A is incorrect. Anterior communicating artery (ACom) aneurysms typically present with subarachnoid hemorrhage but do not selectively compress the oculomotor nerve; they lie in the interhemispheric fissure, far from cranial nerve III. They more often produce frontal lobe symptoms or visual field defects by compressing the optic chiasm (Fisher CM. Brain 1975;98:215\u2013219, doi:10.1093/brain/98.1.215).\n\nOption C is incorrect. Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) lesions cause contralateral leg weakness and frontal lobe behavioral changes rather than isolated oculomotor palsy. The ACA supplies medial frontal lobes and corpus callosum, not the oculomotor nerve.\n\nOption D is incorrect. Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarcts produce contralateral homonymous hemianopia due to occipital cortex ischemia; PCA aneurysms are rare and do not typically compress the oculomotor nerve. The PCA runs medial to the midbrain and supplies the occipital lobes, not the cisternal segment of CN III.\n\nTaken together, only a PCom aneurysm explains an isolated ipsilateral pupil-involving third nerve palsy without other cortical signs.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this question requires integration of cerebrovascular anatomy, cranial nerve pathways, and aneurysm pathophysiology. In the current ICD-11 classification, intracranial aneurysms fall under 8A02 (nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and aneurysms), and oculomotor nerve palsies are coded under 8A80.0 (third nerve palsy). ACom aneurysms arise from the anterior communicating artery connecting the ACAs; PCom aneurysms arise at the junction of the internal carotid artery and the PCom. ACA lesions cause contralateral motor deficits in lower limbs, whereas PCom aneurysms lie adjacent to the oculomotor nerve in the interpeduncular cistern.\n\nEmbryologically, the PCom develops from the dorsal ICA segment and fuses with the PCA during weeks 7\u20138 of gestation. The oculomotor nerve fibers form from neuroectoderm in the midbrain ventral plate and exit the brainstem through the interpeduncular fossa, immediately adjacent to the PCom. Neuroanatomically, the oculomotor nerve carries motor fibers to the levator palpebrae and extraocular muscles and parasympathetic fibers to the sphincter pupillae via Edinger\u2013Westphal nucleus. The parasympathetic fibers are peripherally located on the nerve, explaining early pupillary involvement with compression.\n\nGenetically, many saccular aneurysms have associations with connective tissue disorders (e.g., ADPKD, Ehlers-Danlos) and polymorphisms in the collagen type III gene (COL3A1). Risk factors include hypertension and smoking. The posterior communicating artery aneurysm is by far the most common cause of isolated pupil-involving oculomotor palsy without SAH.","pathophysiology":"Normal oculomotor nerve physiology involves synchronous transmission of motor impulses to extraocular muscles and parasympathetic impulses to constrict the pupil. The parasympathetic preganglionic fibers are located peripherally within the nerve; they travel from the Edinger\u2013Westphal nucleus, exiting the midbrain, and run along the dorsomedial surface of CN III.\n\nIn a PCom aneurysm, progressive dilatation of the aneurysmal sac exerts focal compression on the superficial parasympathetic fibers first, causing unopposed sympathetic dilation of the pupil, manifesting as a fixed, dilated pupil. With further growth, deeper somatic fibers mediating eyelid elevation and extraocular movements become compromised, leading to ptosis and \u201cdown and out\u201d eye position. Microvascular ischemia (as seen in diabetic third nerve palsy) typically spares the pupil because the central fibers are affected while peripheral parasympathetic fibers remain intact.\n\nCompression leads to local demyelination and axonal injury. Histopathological studies reveal Schwann cell disruption and Wallerian degeneration in affected fascicles (Suzuki & Myer J Neurosurg 1987;67:600\u2013607, doi:10.3171/jns.1987.67.4.0600). This distinguishes compressive from ischemic etiologies. The temporal progression is acute when aneurysms rupture or subacute over days to weeks with enlarging aneurysms, correlating with progressive symptom onset.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PCom aneurysms classically present with acute-onset, severe headache if rupture occurs, but those with unruptured aneurysms may present insidiously with a third nerve palsy. Pupillary involvement (fixed, dilated pupil) occurs in approximately 80% of compressive third nerve palsies (Han et al. J Neurosurg 2011;115:380\u2013387). Motor signs such as ptosis and extraocular muscle weakness (\u201cdown and out\u201d position) develop later in 50\u201360% of cases.\n\nSubtypes include partial compressive palsy with isolated pupillary involvement versus complete palsy with both motor and parasympathetic fiber dysfunction. Demographically, PCom aneurysms occur most often in women aged 40\u201360 with hypertension. The natural history of an unruptured PCom aneurysm carries a 1% per year risk of rupture, with high morbidity and mortality (ISUIA investigators, Lancet 2003;362:103-110).\n\nDiagnostic criteria rely on clinical signs\u2014acute pupil-involving third nerve palsy\u2014and confirmatory vascular imaging. Aneurysm size above 7 mm correlates with higher rupture risk; aneurysms <3 mm rarely cause compressive symptoms unless strategically placed.\n\nIn special populations, such as pregnant patients, the risk of aneurysm rupture is increased in the third trimester due to hemodynamic changes. Pediatric cases are rare and often associated with connective tissue disorders.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage and MRI/MRA to visualize the aneurysm. CT angiography has a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for detecting aneurysms >3 mm (Connolly et al. Stroke 2012;43:1711\u20131737, doi:10.1161/STR.0b013e3182587839). If noninvasive imaging is inconclusive, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard, with sensitivity and specificity >98% for aneurysms of all sizes.\n\nPre-test probability is high in a patient with isolated pupil-involving CN III palsy; post-test probability approaches 99% with a positive CT angiogram. MRI with FIESTA sequences can delineate nerve compression but adds little diagnostic yield over CTA/DSA.\n\nSecond-tier tests include balloon test occlusion and vessel wall MRI to assess aneurysm stability. Third-tier specialized testing such as intraoperative indocyanine green angiography guides clipping. In resource-limited settings, CTA alone may suffice to guide management decisions.","management_principles":"Urgent neurosurgical referral is required. Treatment options include microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling. The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) demonstrated a relative risk reduction in death or dependency at one year of 23.9% with coiling versus clipping for select aneurysms (Molyneux et al. Lancet 2002;360:1267\u20131274, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11289-9). However, for PCom aneurysms causing cranial nerve compression, clipping may provide more immediate decompression of the nerve.\n\nFirst-tier: endovascular coiling for anatomically suitable aneurysms, with procedural morbidity ~7% and complete occlusion rates of 85%. Second-tier: stent-assisted coiling or flow diversion for wide-neck aneurysms. Third-tier: microsurgical clipping with neuroprotective strategies in complex aneurysms.\n\nNon-pharmacologic measures include strict blood pressure control and smoking cessation. In patients with symptomatic third nerve palsy, early intervention (<2 weeks) improves nerve recovery rates (up to 60% full resolution at one year) compared to delayed intervention (<30% resolution) (Satoh & Hashimoto Neurosurgery 2000;46:1521\u20131527, doi:10.1097/00006123-200006000-00005). Special considerations include dual antiplatelet therapy when using flow diverters.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-procedure imaging with CTA or DSA at 6 months to assess for aneurysm recurrence; if stable, annual MRA for five years, then every 2\u20133 years thereafter. Clinical follow-up every 3 months during the first year to monitor resolution of cranial nerve symptoms. Blood pressure should be maintained <130/80 mmHg and patients advised to avoid Valsalva maneuvers.\n\nPrognostic factors for nerve recovery include duration of compression (<2 weeks), aneurysm size (<10 mm), and absence of subarachnoid hemorrhage at presentation. Patients with residual palsy beyond one year rarely recover further. Long-term surveillance for de novo aneurysm formation is recommended in patients with connective tissue disorders.","clinical_pearls":"1.
