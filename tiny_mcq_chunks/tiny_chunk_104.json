Option D, lupus cerebritis, involves enhancing inflammatory lesions and systemic lupus features. Imaging of venous sinuses confirming thrombosis establishes CVT.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral Venous Thrombosis is classified as a cerebrovascular disease in ICD-11 (8B21), distinct from arterial stroke. It occurs when thrombus obstructs dural venous sinuses or cortical veins, leading to raised intracranial pressure and venous infarction.

Historically underdiagnosed, CVT recognition improved with MRV introduction in the 1990s.","pathophysiology":"Thrombosis in cerebral veins or sinuses impedes venous drainage, raising venous and capillary pressure.

In a patient with prostate cancer and new focal neurologic deficits, imaging without hemorrhage indicates ischemia rather than bleeding. Option A (hemorrhagic metastases) is incorrect because prostate cancer rarely produces hemorrhagic brain metastases; typical hemorrhagic metastases arise from melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, or choriocarcinoma. Option B (amyloid angiopathy) causes lobar intracerebral hemorrhages in older individuals and would appear as blood on CT/MRI. Option D (tumor recurrence) manifests as an enhancing mass lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema rather than as an infarct. A common pitfall is attributing neurologic deficits in cancer patients to metastatic disease when vascular events are more frequent.","conceptual_foundation":"Ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion leading to neuronal injury. It is classified under vascular neurology and recognized in ICD-11 as 8B11.

It typically presents with symmetric parieto\u2010occipital edema on MRI in 80% of cases (Hinchey et al., 1996). Third nerve palsy without cortical or subcortical white matter changes makes PRES improbable.\n\nOption B: RCVS (Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome) often presents with thunderclap headache, focal deficits, and multifocal segmental vasoconstriction on angiography in 94% of cases (Calabrese et al., 2007). It rarely causes isolated cranial nerve III dysfunction and usually resolves spontaneously in weeks; the absence of thunderclap headache and normal vessel caliber rules it out.\n\nOption C: HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) encephalitis typically causes fever, altered mental status, and temporal lobe lesions, not isolated oculomotor palsy (Bradshaw & Venkatesan, 2016). CSF PCR positivity is about 95% sensitive. In the absence of fever, headache, or CSF abnormalities, HSV is inappropriate.\n\nOption D: None. The most likely cause is a posterior communicating artery aneurysm compressing the oculomotor nerve, presenting with pupil\u2010involving third nerve palsy in up to 50% of unruptured aneurysms (Hasan et al., 2015). Common misconceptions include attributing pupil involvement to diabetic microvascular palsy; however, pupil\u2010sparing is typical in ischemic palsies (Duker & Benson, 2000). The definitive diagnosis relies on vascular imaging demonstrating a PCom aneurysm.\n\nIn summary, PRES, RCVS, and HSV fail to explain the isolated third nerve palsy with pupillary involvement and imaging findings. A PCom aneurysm causing external compression is the only consistent etiology, making \u201cNone\u201d (of the above) correct.","conceptual_foundation":"The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) arises from the oculomotor nucleus and the Edinger\u2013Westphal nucleus in the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus. Fibers exit the ventral midbrain in the interpeduncular fossa, travel between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries, then run along the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus before entering the orbit via the superior orbital fissure. Embryologically, the neural crest contributes to the peripheral Schwann cell component, whereas the midbrain neuroectoderm forms the motor fibers. Normal physiology includes innervation of the levator palpebrae superioris, four extraocular muscles (superior, medial, inferior recti; inferior oblique), and parasympathetic pupillary constrictor via ciliary ganglion. Lesions can cause ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and pupillary dilation.\n\nKey anatomical landmarks include the interpeduncular fossa, cavernous sinus roof, and superior orbital fissure. Compression by a posterior communicating artery aneurysm occurs at the junction between the cisternal and cavernous segments, sparing central nucleus but affecting peripheral parasympathetic fibers first. Related syndromes include Weber\u2019s (midbrain stroke with contralateral hemiparesis) and Benedikt\u2019s (tremor plus oculomotor palsy). Historical descriptions date to early 20th century neurosurgical series identifying aneurysmal third nerve palsy (Dandy, 1928). Modern imaging has refined our understanding of nerve\u2010vessel relationships and compressive neuropathy thresholds. Precise anatomy underpins surgical and endovascular strategies.","pathophysiology":"Posterior communicating artery aneurysms develop at bifurcation points due to congenital media weakness and hemodynamic stress. Wall shear stress induces endothelial dysfunction, leading to matrix metalloproteinase activation, elastin fragmentation, and focal dilation. Genetic predispositions include polycystic kidney disease (PKD1/PKD2 mutations) and connective tissue disorders (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos, COL3A1 mutations). Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin\u20106 and tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha upregulate proteolytic enzymes. Progressive dilation over months to years compresses the adjacent oculomotor nerve peripherally, causing demyelination and Wallerian degeneration of parasympathetic fibers first, producing pupillary dilation (pupil\u2010involving palsy in 80% of compressive lesions) (Keane, 2005).\n\nAt the cellular level, sustained compression disrupts sodium\u2010potassium ATPase, causing ionic imbalance, cytotoxic edema, and nerve conduction block. Compensatory collateral flow in vasa nervorum may delay symptom onset but cannot reverse mechanical distortion. Unruptured aneurysms may remain stable or grow at 0.5\u20131.5 mm/year; rupture risk increases beyond 7 mm diameter (~1% annual rupture) (UCAS Japan Investigators, 2012). Chronic compression triggers secondary demyelination and axonal loss, limiting recovery if untreated beyond 6 weeks. This combination of vascular, genetic, inflammatory, and mechanical factors defines the pathogenesis of aneurysmal third nerve palsy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically note acute or subacute onset of unilateral ptosis and \u2018\u2018down and out\u2019\u2019 eye position over 1\u20137 days, often with ipsilateral periorbital pain in 60% of cases. Pupillary dilation and loss of direct/consensual light reflex appear early due to peripheral parasympathetic fiber involvement. Complete palsy peaks by day 7. Adults represent >90% of cases; rare pediatric presentations often accompany congenital aneurysms or trauma. There is no gender predilection, though some series suggest slight female predominance (female:male 1.2:1).\n\nOn examination, levator function is reduced by 10\u201315 mm, adduction and elevation deficits exceed 80% strength loss, and the affected pupil measures 5\u20136 mm unreactive compared with 3\u20134 mm contralaterally. Pain and headache are red flags for impending rupture. Without intervention, spontaneous recovery is unlikely past 12 weeks; 30% may develop permanent mydriasis or synkinesis. Severity scales such as the Modified Rankin Score and the Horowitz grading for aneurysm neck size (\u22644 mm mild, 5\u20139 mm moderate, \u226510 mm large) guide prognosis. Associated signs may include pupillary sparing in diabetic microvascular palsy; by contrast, compressive lesions spare motor fibers later, explaining early pupillary involvement here.","diagnostic_approach":"1.
