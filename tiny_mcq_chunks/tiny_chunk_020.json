What intervention will change outcomes?","options":["Decompressive hemicraniectomy","Stroke admission","Hyperventilation"],"subspecialty":"Critical Care Neurology","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2022","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Decompressive hemicraniectomy","explanation":{"Option Analysis":"Option A: Decompressive hemicraniectomy in malignant MCA stroke with mass effect and declining consciousness is the only intervention shown in randomized controlled trials (DECIMAL, HAMLET, DESTINY) to significantly reduce mortality and improve functional outcome. In patients under 60 randomized within 48 hours, mortality fell from approximately 80% to 20% at one year and favorable mRS (0\u20134) rates doubled. The procedure lowers intracranial pressure (ICP) by removing a large bone flap (>120 cm\u00b2) and opening the dura to accommodate swelling, reducing midline shift and herniation risk. Option B: Stroke admission alone is standard but does not reverse established malignant edema or herniation. Supportive care on a stroke unit without surgical decompression yields high mortality (70\u201390%) in malignant infarction. Option C: Hyperventilation temporarily reduces PaCO\u2082 and cerebral blood volume, lowering ICP for minutes to hours. However, it risks cerebral vasoconstriction, worsened ischemia in penumbral tissue, and has not been shown to improve long-term outcomes. It is only a bridge while definitive measures are arranged. Thus, decompressive hemicraniectomy is the only outcome-altering option.","Conceptual Foundation":"The middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies lateral frontal, parietal, temporal lobes and deep structures via lenticulostriate branches. An occlusion of the proximal M1 segment leads to a large cortical and subcortical infarction, often called \"malignant\" when edema exceeds compensatory capacity. Rising intracranial pressure (ICP) from vasogenic and cytotoxic edema shifts midline structures, compresses ventricles, and herniates brainstem centers, impairing consciousness by disrupting ascending reticular activating system pathways. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = mean arterial pressure \u2013 ICP) falls, exacerbating ischemia. Key anatomical corridors for uncal herniation include the tentorial notch, where the medial temporal lobe displaces. Subfalcine herniation forces the cingulate gyrus under the falx, causing anterior cerebral artery compression. These shifts underlie the clinical decline in malignant MCA syndrome, and are the targets for surgical decompression. Familiarity with these structural relationships underpins timely recognition and neurosurgical referral.","Pathophysiology":"Acute MCA occlusion triggers energy failure, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, and neuronal Ca\u00b2\u207a influx via NMDA and AMPA receptors. Mitochondrial dysfunction generates reactive oxygen species, activating inflammatory cascades including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which degrade basal lamina and disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Ionic pump failure leads to cytotoxic edema within minutes, while vasogenic edema ensues over 24\u201372 hours as BBB permeability increases. Aquaporin-4 upregulation in astrocyte endfeet accelerates water influx into the interstitium. Genetic polymorphisms\u2014for example, MMP-9 promoter variants\u2014modulate edema severity. Microglial activation and neutrophil infiltration release additional cytokines and proteases, perpetuating edema. The confined cranial vault responds with rising intracranial pressure, compressing venous outflow and perpetuating tissue hypoxia. Without relief, regional perfusion falls below penumbral thresholds (20\u201330 mL/100 g/min), expanding infarct volume. Decompressive hemicraniectomy interrupts this vicious cycle by providing physical space for swelling, preserving CPP and limiting secondary injury.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients with malignant MCA infarction initially present with sudden contralateral hemiparesis (often dense >3/5 MRC), hemisensory loss, and gaze preference toward the lesion. Dominant hemisphere strokes produce global aphasia; non-dominant cause neglect. Over 24\u201372 hours, increasing headache, vomiting, and progressive lethargy signal rising ICP. Neurological exam reveals declining Glasgow Coma Scale scores (<9), new papilledema, and ipsilateral pupil dilation as uncal herniation begins. Decorticate or decerebrate posturing, Cushing\u2019s triad (hypertension with widened pulse pressure, bradycardia, irregular respiration), and rapid midline shift on repeat imaging portend impending herniation. Variations include early coma if collateral flow is poor, or transient lucidity (\u201ctalk-and-die\u201d phenomenon). Prognostic indicators of malignant course include age >60, infarct volume >145 cm\u00b3 on CT perfusion, midline shift >5 mm at 48 hours, and early signs of edema on CT (sulcal effacement, basal cistern compression). Prompt recognition of these signs is essential for timely neurosurgical intervention.","Diagnostic Approach":"Initial noncontrast head CT identifies hypoattenuation in the MCA territory, sulcal effacement, early midline shift, and obliteration of basal cisterns. CT angiography confirms proximal M1 occlusion and collateral status. CT perfusion differentiates core infarct (Tmax >10 s, cerebral blood flow <30% of contralateral) from penumbra. MRI with DWI/ADC mapping is more sensitive within six hours but less available emergently. Serial imaging at 24 and 48 hours monitors edema progression. Invasive ICP monitoring (intraparenchymal bolt) can quantify pressure but is controversial due to risk of hemorrhage. Laboratory tests include CBC (to exclude thrombocytopenia), coags (INR <1.7 for decompression), electrolytes (avoid hyponatremia), and blood glucose (maintain 140\u2013180 mg/dL). Differential diagnoses include large intracerebral hemorrhage, malignant hypertension encephalopathy, or space-occupying tumor. Rapid stroke pathway activation ensures timely neuroimaging and neurosurgical consultation for decompression candidacy assessment.","Management Principles":"Primary goals are reperfusion and control of ICP. Intravenous tPA (0.9 mg/kg, 10% bolus, remainder over 60 minutes) is indicated if within 4.5 hours and no contraindications. Endovascular thrombectomy up to 24 hours (DAWN/DEFUSE-3 criteria) if favorable penumbra. For ICP management: elevate head to 30\u00b0, maintain euvolemia and normocapnia (PaCO\u2082 35\u201345 mmHg), avoid hypotension (MAP >90 mmHg), administer hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV bolus q4\u20136h targeting serum osmolality 300\u2013320 mOsm/kg; hypertonic saline 3% at 0.1\u20131 mL/kg/hour targeting Na 145\u2013155 mmol/L). Sedation (propofol infusion 5\u201380 mcg/kg/min) and short-acting paralytics may be needed for ventilated patients. Decompressive hemicraniectomy within 48 hours is indicated for malignant edema: remove \u226512\u00d715 cm bone flap, open dura widely, and store bone flap sterilely. Contraindications include bilateral infarcts or irreversible brainstem injury. Postoperatively, monitor ICP, cerebral perfusion, and metabolic parameters in the neuro-ICU.","Follow-up Guidelines":"After acute stabilization, daily neurological examinations monitor for delayed hemorrhagic transformation or hydrocephalus. Repeat head CT at 72 hours or on clinical deterioration. Initiate early multidisciplinary rehabilitation: physical, occupational, speech therapy starting within 48\u201372 hours. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81\u2013325 mg/day), statin therapy (atorvastatin 40\u201380 mg/day), and blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg). Screen for atrial fibrillation via telemetry or extended monitoring, initiate anticoagulation if cardioembolic. Carotid duplex or CTA for atherosclerotic evaluation, with endarterectomy if >70% symptomatic stenosis. Monitor bone flap viability and plan cranioplasty at 3\u20136 months once edema resolves. Educate patients and families about malignant stroke signs, importance of blood pressure adherence, smoking cessation, and diet modifications. Schedule outpatient neurology follow-up: weekly for first month, then monthly until three months, then every six months.","Clinical Pearls":"\u2013 Malignant MCA infarction comprises ~10% of large anterior circulation strokes but accounts for disproportionate mortality.  \n\u2013 Early midline shift (>5 mm) on CT predicts malignant course.  \n\u2013 Decompressive hemicraniectomy in patients \u226460 years reduces one-year mortality from 80% to 20%.  \n\u2013 Hyperventilation should be reserved as a temporizing measure (<4 hours) to avoid cerebral vasoconstriction and penumbral ischemia.  \n\u2013 Standard ICP monitors are not routinely required if decompressive craniectomy is planned emergently.  \n\u2013 Maintain normoglycemia and normothermia to reduce secondary injury.  \n\u2013 Distinguish malignant edema from hemorrhagic transformation by follow-up CT at 24 hours.  \n\u2013 Current American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines (2018 update) support early surgery in malignant MCA syndrome.  \n\u2013 Avoid delayed referral; neurosurgical consultation should occur at first radiographic evidence of mass effect.","References":"1.

When mannitol is administered, it creates an osmotic gradient that draws water from the brain tissue into the intravascular compartment. This leads to an increase in plasma volume; as a result, the concentration of red blood cells in the plasma decreases, which effectively reduces blood viscosity. Lower blood viscosity enhances cerebral blood flow and improves oxygen delivery to brain tissues, which is particularly beneficial in conditions such as cerebral edema or intracranial hypertension.","conceptual_foundation":"Mannitol is a sugar alcohol classified as an osmotic diuretic. It works primarily by increasing the osmolarity of the blood, which draws water from tissues into the bloodstream. This property makes it effective for conditions characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), such as traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema, and certain neurological surgeries. The principles of osmotic diuresis rely on the movement of water across semipermeable membranes in response to solute concentration differences, which is fundamental to fluid balance in human physiology.\n\nOsmotic agents like mannitol are not only effective in managing fluid distribution but also play a role in protecting renal function by maintaining urine output during periods of potential nephrotoxicity.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology \n\nIn conditions such as traumatic brain injury or cerebral edema, fluid accumulates in the extracellular space of the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure. This excess pressure can impair cerebral perfusion and lead to ischemic damage. The blood-brain barrier, a selective permeability barrier, becomes crucial in maintaining homeostasis. However, under pathological conditions, its integrity may be compromised, allowing excessive fluid buildup.\n\nMannitol counters this issue by creating an osmotic gradient, pulling excess fluid out of the brain's extracellular space into the vascular system. This action reduces ICP and helps to restore normal cerebral perfusion pressures. The immediate effects of mannitol infusion are observed through changes in plasma volume, blood viscosity, and hematocrit levels.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation \n\nThe clinical manifestations of elevated ICP can include headache, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, and focal neurological deficits. In severe cases, patients may exhibit signs of herniation, such as changes in pupillary responses or decerebrate posturing. When treated with mannitol, patients can experience rapid alleviation of symptoms related to elevated ICP, such as improvement in consciousness and reduction in headache severity.\n\nFurthermore, the rapid onset of action (within 30-60 minutes) makes mannitol a critical intervention in acute settings, such as emergency departments or operating rooms, where immediate control of ICP is vital.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach \n\nTo diagnose elevated ICP, clinicians often utilize imaging studies such as CT or MRI scans to assess for mass effect, hemorrhage, or other contributing factors. Neurological examinations are also critical in evaluating the patient's level of consciousness and neurological function. \n\nIn the context of mannitol use, monitoring includes serial assessments of vital signs, neurological status, and laboratory tests to evaluate renal function and serum osmolarity. It is essential to ascertain the effects of mannitol on blood viscosity and hematocrit, as these parameters can guide further management.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for elevated ICP include brain tumors, abscesses, traumatic brain injury, and hydrocephalus, necessitating a thorough understanding of the underlying pathology to tailor treatment appropriately.\n\n## 6. Management Principles \n\nThe primary management strategy for elevated ICP involves addressing the underlying cause while implementing supportive measures. Mannitol is often used as an immediate intervention due to its rapid action. \n\nOther management strategies may include:\n- Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees to promote venous drainage.\n- Administering hypertonic saline as an alternative osmotic agent.\n- Using sedation to reduce metabolic demands on the brain.\n- Surgical interventions such as decompressive craniectomy in refractory cases.\n\nMonitoring fluid balance is crucial, as mannitol can lead to significant diuresis, which may result in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines \n\nFollowing mannitol administration, patients should be monitored closely for signs of rebound intracranial hypertension and renal function. Serial imaging may be warranted based on the clinical scenario. The prognosis varies depending on the underlying cause of ICP elevation and the timeliness of intervention.\n\nComplications associated with mannitol use include acute kidney injury, electrolyte disturbances, and potential rebound edema after discontinuation.

Within 30\u201360 minutes of IV administration, plasma volume expands and hematocrit falls, leading directly to a reduction in blood viscosity. Decreased viscosity improves cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery. Numerous physiologic studies (e.g., Klatzo I, Acta Neuropathol, 1967; Soustiel JF, J Neurosurg, 2002) and clinical protocols for acute intracranial hypertension demonstrate that hematocrit drops by 5\u201310% within the first hour after a standard 0.5\u20131.0 g/kg mannitol bolus, correlating with a measurable 10\u201315% decrease in blood viscosity (Newtonian rheometry). Options B and D are incorrect because mannitol increases rather than decreases the osmotic gradient across the BBB and dilutes the blood rather than concentrating it. Option C is inaccurate: reduced viscosity actually enhances microvascular perfusion and oxygen delivery rather than impairing it. Thus, the earliest measurable change within an hour of mannitol infusion is decreased blood viscosity.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:46:44.593842","word_count":2749,"source_file":"Promotion 2018_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Critical Care Neurology","import_source":"critical_care_neurology_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"2","question":"What is the primary benefit of administering anticonvulsants during the first week after traumatic brain injury (TBI)?","options":["Decrease early and late seizures","Decrease early seizures","Decrease late seizures","Don't decrease frequency but decrease severity of seizures"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Decrease early seizures","subspecialty":"Critical Care Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: \u201cDecrease early seizures.\u201d A landmark randomized controlled trial by Temkin et al. (1990) demonstrated that prophylactic phenytoin administered within 24 hours of severe TBI reduced the risk of early post-traumatic seizures (PTS) (0\u20137 days) from 14.2% in controls to 3.6% in treated patients (absolute risk reduction 10.6%, Number Needed to Treat 9.4). The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines (2003) give Level A evidence for phenytoin prophylaxis to prevent early PTS but explicitly state no evidence that it reduces late PTS (>7 days) (Chang & Lowenstein, Epilepsia 2003). Option A is incorrect because anticonvulsants do not decrease late seizures. Option C is incorrect for the same reason. Option D is incorrect: there is no significant data showing that prophylaxis alters seizure severity if seizures occur, only frequency of early events.","conceptual_foundation":"Early PTS are defined as seizures occurring within seven days of TBI, thought to arise from acute biochemical disturbances, cortical irritation, and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Late PTS (>7 days) are mediated by secondary gliosis and network reorganization. In ICD-11, early PTS are coded under 8A60.Y \u2018Seizure disorder due to specific causes, early post-traumatic.\u2019 The differential includes acute symptomatic seizures from metabolic derangements and unprovoked epilepsy. Historically, antiseizure prophylaxis in TBI began with barbiturates in the 1960s and shifted to phenytoin in the 1980s, with levetiracetam emerging recently as an alternative.","pathophysiology":"Normal cortical physiology maintains balanced excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic tone. TBI disrupts ion homeostasis, leading to glutamate release, NMDA receptor overactivation, intracellular Ca2+ accumulation, free radical generation, and blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. These changes foster neuronal hyperexcitability acutely, manifesting as early seizures. Phenytoin stabilizes neuronal membranes by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels in inactivated state, reducing repetitive firing. This mechanism is effective during the acute ionic derangement of early PTS but does not modify the chronic processes (gliosis and synaptic plasticity) that underlie late PTS.","clinical_manifestation":"Early PTS typically present as generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures within the first week post-injury, occurring in approximately 4\u201325% of severe TBI (higher in penetrating injuries). Focal seizures with secondary generalization may also occur, reflecting cortical contusion location. Late PTS present weeks to years later and signify post-traumatic epilepsy. Risk factors for early PTS include intracerebral hematoma, depressed skull fracture, and GCS \u226410. Early seizures correlate with worse outcomes, increased intracranial pressure, and secondary brain injury.","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical diagnosis of early PTS is based on witnessed convulsions; continuous EEG monitoring in ICU settings can detect subclinical seizures with >80% sensitivity (DeLorenzo et al. 2002). First-tier evaluation includes noncontrast head CT to assess hemorrhage or evolving edema. Second-tier EEG is indicated if suspicion remains despite no overt convulsion. Continuous EEG monitoring guidelines (ACNS, 2015) recommend 24\u201348 hours of recording in comatose TBI patients. No routine blood levels are used to diagnose early PTS; anti-seizure drug levels guide management.","management_principles":"First-tier prophylaxis: phenytoin loading 15\u201320 mg/kg IV, maintenance 5\u20137 mg/kg/day divided, targeting serum levels 10\u201320 \u03bcg/mL (AAN Class I). Levetiracetam is a Level C alternative: 1,000 mg IV twice daily, with fewer drug interactions. There is no recommendation for valproate prophylaxis due to increased mortality in severe TBI (Friedman et al., J Trauma 2009). Monitor for adverse effects: phenytoin causes gingival hyperplasia, hypotension, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (HLA-B*1502 screening in Asians).","follow_up_guidelines":"Discontinue prophylaxis at seven days post-injury if no seizures have occurred (AAN 2003). If early PTS occur, continue antiseizure medication for at least one year with gradual taper guided by clinical status and EEG normalization. Monitor serum drug levels q72h until stable; then monthly if long-term.

Mannitol is indicated in cerebral edema from traumatic brain injury but is less effective for intraventricular hemorrhage\u2013induced hydrocephalus (AHA/ASA 2015 guidelines). Clinical scenarios in which mannitol may be considered include malignant cerebral edema with midline shift greater than 5 mm or refractory elevated ICP above 25 mm Hg despite ventilatory measures. However, studies show only a 10\u201315 % reduction in ventricular size with mannitol in acute intraventricular hemorrhage (Hemphill et al. 2015). A common misconception is overreliance on osmotherapy before addressing mechanical CSF obstruction. Option B: Administration of thiamine would be appropriate in suspected Wernicke encephalopathy, characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion in chronic alcoholics (Wernicke\u2019s prevalence 12 % among alcoholics). However, abrupt headache, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and acute ventricular enlargement are not features of thiamine deficiency. Empiric thiamine does not improve obstructive hydrocephalus. Option C: External ventricular drainage directly diverts CSF, rapidly normalizing intraventricular pressure and improving consciousness. EVD placement has been shown to reduce ICP from 30 mm Hg to below 15 mm Hg within minutes in 85 % of cases with intraventricular hemorrhage and acute hydrocephalus (International Hydrocephalus Working Group 2019). This intervention addresses the obstructive lesion pathophysiology and is supported by multiple series demonstrating improved 30-day mortality by 20 % when performed within 4 hours of GCS decline (AHA/ASA 2015 guidelines). Option D: Hypothermia (target 33 \u00b0C for 48 hours) has been trialed in intracerebral hemorrhage but carries risks of coagulopathy and infections without proven functional benefit (Eurotherm3235 Trial 2019). It does not rapidly relieve ventricular obstruction, and hypothermia protocols remain investigational rather than standard of care. Common errors include delaying EVD placement in favor of temporary osmotherapy, which may worsen outcomes by prolonging elevated ICP and increasing secondary ischemia. Option C is definitively correct because it addresses the primary mechanical obstruction causing acute hydrocephalus and declining neurologic status.","conceptual_foundation":"The basal ganglia and adjacent ventricular system are central to this scenario. Anatomically, the basal ganglia comprise the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra. Their blood supply arises from the lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery, vessels susceptible to hypertensive rupture. The lateral ventricles lie medially, with the foramen of Monro connecting to the third ventricle at the level of the thalamus. Embryologically, these structures derive from the telencephalon and diencephalon, with ventricular formation beginning at week 6 of gestation. Normal CSF production (approximately 500 mL/day) in the choroid plexus circulates through the ventricular system and is absorbed by arachnoid granulations into the superior sagittal sinus. When hemorrhage extends into the ventricles, blood clots obstruct foramen pathways, leading to acute obstructive hydrocephalus. Historically, Cushing first described the clinical triad of headache, vomiting, and altered consciousness in intracranial hypertension in 1903. Subsequent recognition of intraventricular hemorrhage as a cause of rapid decompensation refined neurosurgical approaches, including ventriculostomy and endoscopic clot removal. Key landmarks include the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle for EVD catheter insertion, localized approximately 2.5 cm lateral to the midline and 1 cm anterior to the coronal suture. Clinically significant pathways also involve the thalamocortical projections adjacent to the third ventricle, where pressure changes can impact arousal and consciousness through reticular activating system disruption.","pathophysiology":"Intraventricular extension of hemorrhage leads to immediate mechanical obstruction of CSF flow at the foramen of Monro or aqueduct of Sylvius. Blood breakdown products activate inflammatory cascades, involving microglial release of cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which increase blood\u2013brain barrier permeability and exacerbate vasogenic edema. At the molecular level, hemoglobin degradation produces free iron, generating reactive oxygen species through Fenton chemistry, causing lipid peroxidation of neuronal membranes. Excitotoxic release of glutamate binds NMDA receptors, leading to calcium influx and triggering caspase-mediated apoptosis. Ion channel dysfunction, particularly impaired Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase from energy failure, contributes to cytotoxic edema as water shifts intracellularly. Genetic predispositions such as apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele may increase susceptibility to hemorrhagic extension. Compensatory mechanisms include ventricular compliance changes and transventricular CSF shifts into subarachnoid space, but these are overwhelmed in acute settings. Over minutes to hours, intracranial pressure rises above 20 mm Hg, reducing cerebral perfusion pressure below the threshold of 50 mm Hg, resulting in ischemia and secondary injury. Without rapid CSF diversion, herniation syndromes such as uncal or central transtentorial herniation may ensue, causing irreversible brainstem dysfunction. The interplay of mechanical obstruction, inflammation, and oxidative stress underlies the progressive neurologic deterioration observed in this patient.","clinical_manifestation":"The onset of intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus is abrupt, with patients often reporting a thunderclap headache, peak intensity within seconds. The symptom timeline begins with headache and vomiting, followed by progressive decline in consciousness over 30\u2013120 minutes. On examination, key findings include altered mental status graded by the Glasgow Coma Scale, pupillary changes if herniation begins, and focal motor deficits depending on hematoma location. In basal ganglia hemorrhage, contralateral hemiparesis or sensory loss of face and arm predominates. In elderly patients, comorbid hypertension and fragile vessels contribute to higher rates of intraventricular extension (up to 50 % in those over age 60). Pediatric intraventricular hemorrhage often arises from prematurity and germinal matrix fragility, presenting with bulging fontanelle. Gender differences are minimal for hemorrhagic volume tolerance. Systemic manifestations include transient hypertension spikes, bradycardia from Cushing reflex, and respiratory irregularity. Severity scales such as the ICH Score (0\u20136) incorporate GCS, hematoma volume (>30 mL yields 2 points), presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and age (>80 adds 1 point) to predict 30-day mortality. Red flags include sudden neurologic decline, seizure occurrence, and signs of increased ICP such as bradycardia with hypertension. Without treatment, natural history often leads to coma within hours and mortality rates exceeding 80 % at one month for expansive hemorrhage with hydrocephalus.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Immediate noncontrast head CT to confirm ICH location and volume (sensitivity >95 %, specificity >98 % for acute hemorrhage) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: If CT shows ventricular enlargement or acute hydrocephalus, measure ventricular indices and Evans ratio. No lumbar puncture due to risk of herniation (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Step 3: Obtain CTA head and neck to assess for vascular malformation or aneurysm if no clear hypertensive etiology, sensitivity 90 % (per AHA/ASA 2015 guidelines). Step 4: Continuous ICP monitoring via intraparenchymal or ventricular catheter if hydrocephalus suspected (per Brain Trauma Foundation 2016 guidelines). Step 5: MRI with T2* gradient echo or susceptibility-weighted imaging can detect microbleeds or cavernomas if initial CT is equivocal, sensitivity 85 % (per European Stroke Organisation 2019). Step 6: Laboratory work including CBC, coagulation panel (INR target <1.4), liver function, and toxicology screen to address reversible coagulopathy per AHA/ASA 2015 guidelines. Step 7: Bedside transcranial Doppler may assess cerebral vasospasm in subarachnoid component, measurement of mean flow velocity >120 cm/s suggests spasm (per American Society of Neuroimaging 2020 criteria). Differential diagnoses such as ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, neoplasm with hemorrhage, or venous sinus thrombosis should be distinguished by imaging characteristics and clinical context.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): External ventricular drainage with closed sterile catheter insertion at Kocher\u2019s point, initial pressure setting 10\u201315 cm H2O, goal ICP <20 mm Hg, CSF drainage 20 mL every hour until ventricular size normalizes (per AHA/ASA 2015 guidelines). Tier 2 (Second-line): If EVD fails or clot burden persists, consider intraventricular thrombolysis with low-dose tissue plasminogen activator 1 mg every 12 hours for up to 72 hours to accelerate clot resolution, monitor fibrinogen levels (per Intraventricular Hemorrhage Thrombolysis Trial 2018 consensus).

Maintain systolic blood pressure between 140 and 160 mm Hg using intravenous labetalol boluses of 10 mg every 10 minutes, or nicardipine infusion at 5 mg/h titrated to effect (per AHA/ASA 2015 guidelines).
