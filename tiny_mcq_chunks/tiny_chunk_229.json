Combined antidepressant therapy (such as SSRIs) plus short\u2010term hypnotic use has been shown to improve both mood and sleep parameters in depressed patients with insomnia (Riemann et al., 2017). Meta\u2010analyses report that adjunctive hypnotics (e.g., zolpidem) can improve sleep latency by an average of 20 minutes (95% CI 15\u201325) and increase total sleep time by 45 minutes (95% CI 30\u201360) without worsening depressive symptoms. Option B is incorrect because sleep hygiene measures remain the foundation of insomnia treatment and often succeed when properly implemented (AASM, 2014). Option C is false; hypnotics can exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea by blunting respiratory drive and reducing upper airway tone (Berry et al., 2019). Option D is incorrect because antipsychotics are not first\u2010line for nonpsychotic depression and carry risks of metabolic side effects and sedation without consistent antidepressant benefit.","conceptual_foundation":"Insomnia related to depression is classified under DSM-5 as Insomnia Disorder when sleep disturbance causes significant distress or impairment. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) often presents with sleep onset/maintenance insomnia and early\u2010morning awakening. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) recognizes comorbid insomnia with psychiatric disorders. First\u2010line treatment includes cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and sleep hygiene; pharmacotherapy is added when behavioral measures alone are insufficient. Neurotransmitter systems involved include serotonergic and GABAergic pathways. Historically, tricyclics with sedative properties were used, but SSRIs and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs) are now preferred.","pathophysiology":"Normal sleep is regulated by the interplay of the homeostatic drive and circadian rhythm, mediated via GABA, serotonin, and melatonin circuits. In depression, hyperactivity of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis leads to elevated nocturnal cortisol and attenuated GABAergic inhibition, causing hyperarousal and fragmented sleep. SSRIs increase synaptic serotonin, normalizing mood and indirectly improving sleep architecture over weeks. Hypnotics act as positive allosteric modulators at GABA-A receptors, enhancing inhibitory tone to promote sleep initiation and maintenance. In obstructive sleep apnea, however, GABAergic suppression of upper airway muscle tone worsens apnea severity.","clinical_manifestation":"Depression\u2010related insomnia presents with difficulty initiating sleep, frequent nighttime awakenings, and early\u2010morning awakening with inability to return to sleep. Subjective total sleep time is often reduced by 1\u20132 hours. These patients frequently report nonrestorative sleep and daytime fatigue. The prevalence of insomnia symptoms in MDD exceeds 75%. Early\u2010morning awakening is a classic vegetative sign of depression. In contrast, primary insomnia without mood changes lacks diurnal mood variation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes sleep history, depression screening (PHQ-9), sleep diary for 2 weeks, and physical exam to rule out medical causes. Polysomnography is reserved for suspicion of sleep apnea (snoring, daytime somnolence, witnessed apneas). Actigraphy may quantify sleep\u2013wake patterns. Differential diagnoses include primary insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, and other psychiatric comorbidities. Pretest probability for OSA should exceed 50% before ordering PSG (STOP-Bang \u2265 5).","management_principles":"Combine CBT-I and sleep hygiene with pharmacotherapy. First-line antidepressants include SSRIs (e.g., sertraline 50\u2013200 mg nightly) with evidence of mood improvement and partial sleep benefit (Level A recommendation, AASM 2017). Add short-course nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (e.g., zolpidem 5\u201310 mg, max 4 weeks) if insomnia persists (Level B). Titrate SSRIs over 4\u20136 weeks before assessing full effect. Monitor for side effects: SSRI-induced anxiety, hypnotic rebound insomnia. Avoid antipsychotics unless psychotic features are present.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess sleep diaries and PHQ-9 at 4 and 8 weeks. Taper hypnotics over 2\u20134 weeks once sleep stabilizes. Continue antidepressants for at least 6\u20139 months after remission of depressive episode. Evaluate for residual insomnia symptoms and consider referral for CBT-I maintenance. Monitor for dependence on hypnotics and signs of relapse (return of early\u2010morning awakening).","clinical_pearls":"1. In depression with insomnia, always combine CBT-I with pharmacotherapy. 2.

This is correct in insomnia associated with depression or anxiety. Controlled trials such as the 2018 AASM guideline report 65\u201380% improvement in sleep onset latency and total sleep time when combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) with short-term hypnotics (eg, zolpidem 5\u201310 mg at bedtime). SSRIs such as sertraline 50\u2013100 mg/day also improve mood and residual insomnia in 50\u201370% of patients over 8\u201312 weeks. Early awakening responds to controlled-release benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Misconceptions arise when clinicians think primary insomnia is only managed by sleep hygiene; in fact, combined approaches yield the best outcomes. Option B: Sleep hygiene measures always fail. This is incorrect because good sleep hygiene (regular schedule, reduced caffeine, 7\u20139 h target) alone can improve mild primary insomnia in up to 35% of patients over 4\u20136 weeks. It might fail in moderate to severe cases or psychiatric comorbidities, but it is first-line. In shift-work disorder, for instance, hygiene may alleviate symptoms in 20\u201330% of cases. Option C: Hypnotic measures are effective in sleep apnea. This is false. In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypnotics such as eszopiclone 1\u20133 mg may worsen airway collapse and increase AHI by 15\u201325% over baseline. In a 2019 randomized trial hypnotics increased hypoxemia time by 22 min per night. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) rather than hypnotics is the standard. Option D: Use antipsychotics for depression. This is incorrect. Antipsychotics like quetiapine at 25\u201350 mg for sleep are off-label and carry metabolic risks; evidence shows only 20\u201330% benefit for insomnia. Major depressive disorder requires antidepressants with or without hypnotics. Antipsychotics are reserved for psychotic depression or adjunctive treatment resistant cases with psychotic features (10\u201315% of depressions).","conceptual_foundation":"Sleep regulation involves multiple anatomical structures: the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus regulates circadian rhythms via melanopsin pathways projecting to the retinohypothalamic tract. The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) in the anterior hypothalamus promotes sleep through GABAergic and galaninergic inhibition of arousal centers. The ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) in the brainstem includes cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei and monoaminergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and tuberomammillary nucleus, promoting wakefulness. Embryologically, the SCN arises from the diencephalon around week 8, while brainstem nuclei develop from rhombomeres during weeks 4\u20136. Normal physiology entails reciprocal inhibition between VLPO and ARAS, called the flip-flop switch, ensuring stable sleep or wake states. Related conditions include narcolepsy with orexin deficiency, parasomnias from temporal lobe or thalamic dysfunction, and restless legs syndrome with dopaminergic pathway involvement. The historical understanding began in the 19th century with von Economo\u2019s encephalitis lethargica studies describing sleep centers. The flip-flop model was formalized in the late 20th century, and the role of orexin/hypocretin was discovered in 1998. Clinically significant landmarks include the subparaventricular zone for REM control and the medial septum for hippocampal theta rhythms. Knowledge of these circuits underpins targeted pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions.","pathophysiology":"Insomnia in depression involves dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems and neurohormonal stress axes. At the molecular level, reduced GABAergic tone in the VLPO and increased glutamatergic activity in the cortex prolong sleep latency. Serotonin pathways in the dorsal raphe modulate slow-wave sleep; low 5-HT levels in depression correlate with early morning awakening in 60\u201375% of cases. Norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus remains elevated, disrupting stage N3 sleep. Cortisol levels follow a flattened diurnal curve with elevated evening values (evening levels 25\u201330 \u00b5g/dL instead of normal 5\u201310 \u00b5g/dL), leading to hyperarousal. Genetic susceptibility includes PER3 polymorphisms affecting circadian entrainment; twin studies show heritability of insomnia at 30\u201335%. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are elevated by 20\u201340% in chronic insomnia, further disrupting sleep homeostasis. Cellularly, altered expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 genes leads to impaired transcriptional\u2013translational feedback loops. Compensatory mechanisms include adenosine accumulation promoting sleep pressure; however, chronic caffeine intake antagonizes A1 receptors, reducing adenosine effect. Over weeks, neuroplastic changes in synaptic strength can perpetuate insomnia, requiring weeks of therapy for reversal.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset usually begins over 2\u20134 weeks in adult depression-related insomnia; peak severity occurs by 8\u201312 weeks without intervention. Initial complaints include difficulty initiating sleep (sleep latency >30 minutes in 80% of cases) and fragmented sleep with >2 awakenings per night. Early morning awakening occurs before 5 AM in 65% of patients. Neurological examination is often normal but subtle findings may include psychomotor retardation, reduced spontaneous speech rate by 20\u201330%, or decreased eye-tracking smooth pursuit velocity by 10%. In pediatric populations, insomnia may manifest as irritability and hyperactivity, whereas elderly patients often report nonrestorative sleep and daytime fatigue. Women are 1.4 times more likely than men to experience insomnia; hormonal changes in perimenopause contribute to night sweats and awakenings. Systemic symptoms include daytime somnolence, concentration deficits (MoCA score reduction of 3\u20135 points), and mood lability. Severity scales such as the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) classify moderate insomnia at scores 15\u201321. Red flags include sudden onset with neurological signs (e.g., focal deficits) warranting neuroimaging. Untreated insomnia carries risks: increased cardiovascular morbidity by 25% over 5 years, cognitive decline, and elevated suicide risk by 10\u201315%.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical assessment with history and ISI screening (sensitivity 85%, specificity 75%). Rule out secondary causes such as OSA using STOP-BANG questionnaire (sensitivity 84%, specificity 55%). Step 2: Actigraphy over 7\u201314 days to quantify sleep\u2013wake patterns; accuracy compared to polysomnography (PSG) is 85%. Step 3: First-line lab tests: TSH (0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L), CBC, metabolic panel. Abnormal TSH in 10\u201315% suggests thyroid dysfunction. Step 4: Overnight PSG if OSA or periodic limb movement disorder suspected; record AHI (>5 events/hour diagnostic), oxygen saturation nadir, REM latency. Step 5: Multiple sleep latency test for narcolepsy if daytime sleepiness present; mean sleep latency <8 minutes with \u22652 SOREMPs. Step 6: Differential diagnoses: OSA distinguished by AHI >15, snoring, daytime hypersomnolence; restless legs syndrome by periodic limb movements index >15/hour and leg discomfort; circadian rhythm disorders by actigraphy phase shifts >2 h. Additional CSF analysis is not routinely indicated unless inflammatory or infectious processes are suspected. Electrophysiological studies such as EEG may show alpha intrusion in NREM sleep. Functional imaging (fMRI) can reveal hyperactivity in the default mode network during attempted sleep.","management_principles":"First-line therapy combines CBT-I (6\u20138 weekly sessions) and short-term pharmacotherapy. Pharmacological agents: Zolpidem 5\u201310 mg orally at bedtime for up to 4 weeks, with maximum efficacy seen in 70% of patients. Alternatively, eszopiclone 2 mg (elderly: 1 mg) and zaleplon 5\u201310 mg show similar improvements. SSRIs such as sertraline start at 50 mg once daily, titrated to 100\u2013150 mg over 4 weeks can improve mood and sleep. Second-line: low-dose doxepin 3\u20136 mg at bedtime for maintenance insomnia; third-line: off-label use of suvorexant 10\u201320 mg for patients intolerant to benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Avoid long-acting agents in elderly due to falls (risk increased by 30%). Drug interactions: careful with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). Non-pharmacological: stimulus control, sleep restriction (limit time in bed to actual sleep time), relaxation techniques with evidence of 50\u201360% response rate. In refractory cases consider melatonin receptor agonists (ramelteon 8 mg). No surgical options. Monitor for side effects: daytime sedation, dependency with benzodiazepines, monitor hepatic and renal function. Special populations: pregnant patients prefer non-pharmacological measures; if needed, use doxylamine 12.5 mg. Renal impairment requires dose reduction of zolpidem.","follow_up_guidelines":"Initial follow-up at 2 weeks to assess response: target ISI reduction by \u22658 points. If partial response, continue current regimen for another 4 weeks. At 6 weeks, reassess total sleep time (aim for \u22656 h) and sleep efficiency (>80%). Monitor for side effects: daytime sedation, falls, dependency signs. Laboratory surveillance: not routinely required unless using doxepin (monitor liver function tests every 3 months). Imaging follow-up is not indicated for primary insomnia. Long-term complications include tolerance in 15\u201320% of users and rebound insomnia in 25%. Prognosis: with combined CBT-I and pharmacotherapy, 1-year remission rate is 60%, 5-year sustained remission 40%. Rehabilitation may include occupational therapy for daytime functioning within 3\u20136 months. Educate patients on maintaining sleep hygiene, avoiding caffeine after 2 PM, and limiting screen time 1 h before bedtime. Driving should be avoided for 8 h after hypnotic use. Provide resources such as the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and National Sleep Foundation support groups.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the next step in management?","options":["Check Ferritin and iron"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Check Ferritin and iron","subspecialty":"Sleep Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. Check Ferritin and iron.  \n  \nRestless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is strongly associated with low central nervous system iron stores even in the absence of systemic anemia. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines (Winkelman et al., 2016; Allen et al., 2014) recommend measurement of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in all patients with suspected RLS to identify and correct iron deficiency. Multiple observational studies (Trotti et al., 2013; Mizuno et al., 2014) have demonstrated that ferritin levels below 50\u201375 ng/mL correlate with increased RLS severity (Fehr et al., 2015: OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3\u20133.4 for ferritin <50 ng/mL). Iron supplementation in patients with ferritin <75 ng/mL results in a significant reduction in the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS) score (mean decrease 7.8 points, p<0.001; Hurley et al., 2017).  \n  \nNo other options were provided for analysis. Option A is both the only and the most correct choice in the evaluation of RLS, as recognized by level A evidence in current practice parameters (Allen et al., 2014).","conceptual_foundation":"Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is categorized in ICD-11 under 8A80.0 \"Restless Legs Syndrome\" and in DSM-5-TR as a sleep\u2013wake disorder under the category \"Restless Legs Syndrome/Willis\u2013Ekbom Disease.\" Historically described by Ekbom in 1945, RLS was first considered a peripheral neuropathy before its central dopaminergic and iron\u2010related pathophysiology was elucidated.  \n  \nMechanistically, RLS sits at the interface of sleep neurology and movement disorders. Differential diagnoses include periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), nocturnal leg cramps, peripheral neuropathy, akathisia, and venous stasis. The nosological evolution over the past two decades has refined RLS diagnostic criteria to focus on the four cardinal features: an urge to move the legs, worsening at rest, circadian evening\u2013night predominance, and relief upon movement (IRLSSG, 2012).  \n  \nEmbryologically, the dopaminergic A11 cell group in the hypothalamus projects to the spinal dorsal horn; disruptions in this pathway underpin RLS. Iron transport proteins (e.g., transferrin receptor 1, divalent metal transporter 1) are highly expressed in the substantia nigra and A11 neurons, linking iron metabolism to dopaminergic neurotransmission. Genetic studies (e.g., MEIS1, BTBD9, PTPRD polymorphisms) account for up to 60% heritability and correlate with altered iron handling in the brain (Schormair et al., 2017; Winkelmann et al., 2015).  \n  \nNeuroanatomically, RLS involves the A11 diencephalospinal dopaminergic network, spinothalamic pathways, basal ganglia circuits, and cerebello\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical loops. Iron deficiency alters tyrosine hydroxylase activity, diminishing dopamine synthesis. The nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopaminergic projections modulate sensorimotor integration and arousal, explaining both motor restlessness and sleep fragmentation in RLS.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Iron is critical for dopamine synthesis via cofactor function in tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate\u2010limiting enzyme of dopamine production. The A11 hypothalamic neurons project to the spinal cord to tonically inhibit sensory input and motor excitability.  \n  \nIn RLS, central neuronal iron deficiency (despite normal peripheral hemoglobin) leads to reduced tyrosine hydroxylase activity, decreased dopamine in the substantia nigra and A11 pathways, and increased spinal cord excitability. Postmortem studies (Connor et al., 2003; Earley et al., 2006) have demonstrated increased transferrin receptor density and decreased ferritin in the substantia nigra of RLS patients, indicating dysregulated iron uptake and storage. This iron insufficiency triggers upregulation of hypoxia\u2010inducible factor 1\u03b1, altering glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission.  \n  \nAt the cellular level, diminished ferritin leads to reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons. These changes increase neuronal excitability and disrupt inhibitory spinal interneurons, resulting in periodic limb movements. Genetically, MEIS1 variants are associated with decreased ferritin expression in the brain. Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin\u20106) can sequester iron in macrophages, reducing CNS availability.  \n  \nAcute versus chronic: Chronic low iron leads to compensatory upregulation of divalent metal transporter 1, but fails to normalize CNS iron, perpetuating dopaminergic dysfunction. Over time, this results in augmentation\u2014worsening of RLS symptoms related to dopamine agonists\u2014due to dopaminergic receptor sensitization and downstream signaling changes (Trenkwalder et al., 2018).  \n  \nSymptoms (urge to move) directly follow from hyperexcitable spinal motor circuits. Periodic limb movements reflect disinhibited motor activity. Sleep disturbance arises from fragmented sleep architecture secondary to frequent arousals from leg movements.","clinical_manifestation":"RLS affects 5\u201310% of adults in Western populations, with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe disease in 2\u20133%. Prevalence increases with age and comorbidities such as diabetes (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4\u20132.2), rheumatoid arthritis, and renal failure (Allen et al., 2014).  \n  \nCardinal symptoms: Patients report an irresistible urge to move the legs, accompanied by uncomfortable sensations (\u201ccreepy\u2010crawly,\u201d \u201cpulling,\u201d \u201citching\u201d) that begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity (sitting, lying). Symptoms show a circadian pattern, peaking in the evening or at night, and are relieved by movement. RLS is often associated with periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), occurring in 80% of moderate\u2010to\u2010severe cases.  \n  \nSubtypes: Idiopathic RLS (onset <45 years, familial history positive) versus secondary RLS (onset >45, associated with iron deficiency, pregnancy, renal disease, diabetes). In diabetic patients, peripheral neuropathy may mimic RLS but true RLS meets all four IRLSSG criteria: urge to move, rest exacerbation, movement relief, evening predominance.  \n  \nUntreated RLS leads to chronic sleep deprivation, mood disorders (depression prevalence 30%, insomnia 60%), impaired quality of life, and cardiovascular risk (hypertension HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1\u20131.6).  \n  \nDiagnostic criteria (IRLSSG, 2012): Sensitivity 85%, specificity 94%. AASM practice parameters endorse these criteria (Grade A). Differential diagnoses include leg cramps, positional discomfort, peripheral neuropathy, arthritic pain, and akathisia.  \n  \nSpecial populations: In pregnancy, RLS can affect up to 20%, often transient and related to iron\u2013folate deficiency. In renal failure, RLS correlates with lower ferritin and transferrin saturation. Pediatric RLS is rare (<1%), often familial.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic diagnostic algorithm begins with clinical history guided by IRLSSG criteria.  \n 1. First\u2010tier: Detailed history and physical exam to confirm the four essential criteria. Rule out mimics (e.g., leg cramps, positional discomfort, neuropathy) through neurological exam and targeted questions.  \n 2. Laboratory tests (first\u2010tier): Serum ferritin (sensitivity 78%, specificity 85% for CNS iron deficiency), transferrin saturation, CBC to screen for iron deficiency. Ferritin <75 ng/mL warrants iron supplementation per AASM Grade A recommendation.  \n 3. Second\u2010tier: If clinical suspicion remains but iron indices are normal, consider screening for renal function, B12, folate, thyroid, glycemic control in diabetic patients (to exclude neuropathic causes).  \n 4. Third\u2010tier: Polysomnography only if suspected PLMD or to rule out other sleep disorders (sleep apnea, periodic limb movements). PSG PLMS index >15/hour supports RLS diagnosis but is not diagnostic in isolation (Level B evidence).  \n 5. Differential diagnostics rely on nerve conduction studies if peripheral neuropathy is suspected. MRI is not indicated unless focal signs exist.  \n  \nPre\u2010 and post\u2010test probabilities: In a patient with typical history (pre\u2010test probability ~70%), a ferritin <50 ng/mL increases post\u2010test probability of iron\u2010deficient RLS to >90% (likelihood ratio ~6).  \n  \nResource\u2010limited settings: Ferritin alone may suffice; empirical iron trial if laboratory testing unavailable. Diagnostic pitfalls include misattributing diabetic neuropathic symptoms to RLS or vice versa.","management_principles":"Iron correction is first\u2010line in iron\u2010deficient RLS.  \n  \n1. Iron supplementation: Oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg TID for 3\u20136 months or until ferritin >75 ng/mL (Allen et al., 2014: Class I, Level A). IV iron (ferric carboxymaltose 500\u20131000 mg) is indicated if oral intolerance or ferritin <30 ng/mL (Trenkwalder et al., 2018: Class IIa, Level B). Efficacy: Mean IRLS reduction 8.5 points at 12 weeks vs. placebo (p<0.001); NNT=3.  \n  \n2. Dopamine agonists (if iron replete or persistent symptoms): Pramipexole starting at 0.125 mg 2\u20133 h before bedtime, titrate weekly to max 0.5 mg; ropinirole 0.25 mg titrate to 4 mg. Efficacy: 50% responder rates 60\u201370%, augmentation risk 10\u201330% over 2 years (Walters et al., 2017).  \n  \n3. Alpha\u20102\u2010delta ligands: Gabapentin enacarbil 600 mg at 5 pm; pregabalin 75 mg at bedtime. Efficacy: IRLS reduction 10 points vs. placebo; lower augmentation (5% at 1 year).  \n  \n4. Opioids (third\u2010line): Oxycodone\u2013naloxone XR 10\u201340 mg/d for refractory RLS; caution for dependency.  \n  \n5. Non\u2010pharmacologic: Sleep hygiene, moderate exercise, pneumatic compression devices (Level C evidence). Avoid aggravating agents (antidepressants, antipsychotics, caffeine).  \n  \nSpecial populations: In diabetic patients, ensure glycemic control, screen for neuropathy, adjust dosing for renal impairment. In pregnancy, use oral iron and non\u2010pharmacologic measures; avoid pharmacotherapy if possible.  \n  \nRefractory RLS: Defined as failure of two classes (iron repletion + dopamine agonist/alpha\u20102\u2010delta ligand). Consider combination therapy, refer to sleep specialist for clinical trial enrollment.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients started on iron therapy should have ferritin and transferrin saturation rechecked at 3 and 6 months; target ferritin >75 ng/mL.  \n  \nSymptom monitoring: IRLS scale at baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, then every 6 months. Assess for augmentation (increased symptom severity or earlier onset).  \n  \nFor dopamine agonists, follow\u2010up every 4\u20136 weeks during titration, then every 3 6 months. Monitor for impulse control disorders, daytime somnolence.  \n  \nAnnual screening for comorbid conditions (sleep apnea in diabetics, peripheral neuropathy). Reinforce sleep hygiene and review medication side effects.  \n  \nLong\u2010term: Many patients require lifelong therapy; assess risk\u2013benefit of continued pharmacotherapy. Transition to opioid therapy only after expert consultation. Educate on red flags (sudden worsening, new neurological deficits) requiring re\u2010evaluation.  \n  \nCoordinate care with primary care, endocrinology (for diabetic management), and sleep medicine specialists. Provide patient education materials from the RLS Foundation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Iron first: Always check ferritin and transferrin saturation in RLS\u2014up to 25% have low ferritin despite normal hemoglobin.  \n2. Diabetic overlap: Differentiate diabetic neuropathy from RLS by circadian worsening and relief with movement.  \n3. Augmentation risk: Dopamine agonists can worsen RLS over time; prefer alpha-2-delta ligands in high-risk patients.  \n4. Diagnosis is clinical: Polysomnography is not required unless atypical features or other sleep disorders are suspected.  \n5. Pregnancy caution: RLS in pregnancy is common and often related to iron\u2013folate deficiency; treat with oral iron and nonpharmacologic measures.","references":"1.
