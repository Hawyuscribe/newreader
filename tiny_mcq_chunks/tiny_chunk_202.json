Hereditary plexopathy (Option D) presents bilaterally, in childhood or adolescence.","conceptual_foundation":"Brachial plexopathies are classified by anatomical trunk involvement and etiology: neoplastic/compressive, radiation\u2010induced, inflammatory (neuralgic amyotrophy), hereditary. Pancoast tumors (superior sulcus) compress C8\u2013T1 roots and sympathetic chain causing ipsilateral arm pain/weakness and Horner\u2019s syndrome.","pathophysiology":"Neoplastic infiltration/compression of the lower trunk and sympathetic fibers leads to denervation of C8\u2013T1 myotomes (finger/wrist flexors), sensory loss in ulnar distribution, and interruption of oculosympathetic pathway (Horner\u2019s). Radiation damage (fibrosis) spares small autonomic fibers early and produces painless myokymic activity.","clinical_manifestation":"Compressive plexopathy from apex tumor produces severe shoulder and arm pain radiating along C8\u2013T1, weakness of intrinsic hand muscles, and ipsilateral ptosis/anhidrosis.

The superior oblique muscle depresses the adducted eye, so looking down and to the left primarily engages the left superior oblique. A trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV) palsy on the same side produces vertical diplopia worse on down gaze toward the side of the lesion, with extorsion and hypertropia on the affected side. The trochlear nucleus lesion (Option D) would affect the contralateral eye due to fiber decussation; right nucleus lesion causes left SO palsy but often has additional brainstem signs. Right trochlear nerve (Option A) palsy would impair right SO and worsen on down gaze to the right. Left trochlear nucleus (Option B) lesion would produce right SO palsy. Thus, isolated worsening on down-left gaze localizes to the left trochlear nerve.","conceptual_foundation":"The trochlear nucleus is in the dorsal midbrain at the level of the inferior colliculus; fibers decussate within the superior medullary velum and exit dorsally as the trochlear nerve, which innervates the contralateral superior oblique. Pre\u2010decussation lesions (nucleus) yield contralateral SO palsy plus midbrain signs; post\u2010decussation (nerve) lesions yield ipsilateral SO palsy in isolation. Superior oblique actions include depression in adduction and intorsion. In primary gaze, the head is often tilted toward the opposite shoulder to compensate (Bielschowsky head tilt test).","pathophysiology":"In trochlear nerve palsy, damage to the nerve leads to denervation of the superior oblique muscle, causing unopposed action of the inferior oblique. This leads to hypertropia, extorsion, and vertical diplopia that worsens on down gaze toward the lesion side and head tilt toward the opposite shoulder. Etiologies include microvascular ischemia (diabetes, hypertension), trauma, compressive lesions (tumors), or congenital dysgenesis. Nerve ischemia causes segmental demyelination and Wallerian degeneration, disrupting axonal conduction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report vertical and torsional diplopia, worsened when reading or descending stairs. They often tilt their head toward the opposite shoulder to minimize diplopia. On exam, there is hypertropia of the affected eye that increases with contralateral gaze and ipsilateral head tilt (positive head tilt test). There are no horizontal gaze deficits. Pain is uncommon unless compressive etiology.","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical diagnosis is made by Hess\u2013Lancaster testing and Parks\u2013Bielschowsky three\u2010step test. MRI of the brainstem and orbits with contrast is indicated if atypical features or trauma. CT may detect fractures in trauma. Laboratory workup for diabetes and hypertension if microvascular etiology is suspected.","management_principles":"Microvascular palsies are managed conservatively with prism correction and observation; 80% recover within 3 months. Surgical correction (inferior oblique weakening or SO tuck) is considered after 6\u201312 months if persistent. Botulinum toxin injection into the ipsilateral inferior oblique may provide temporary relief (Class IIa recommendation). Strabismus surgery is tailored based on ocular deviation measurements.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up at 6\u201312 weeks to assess spontaneous recovery.

One-and-a-half syndrome consists of a unilateral horizontal conjugate gaze palsy (the \u201cone\u201d) plus an ipsilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (the \u201chalf\u201d). In the scenario, the left eye cannot abduct or adduct (horizontal gaze palsy), and the right eye can only abduct (adduction deficit), fitting one-and-a-half syndrome. Option A (BINO) would produce bilateral adduction deficits with preserved abduction in both eyes. Option B (INO) would be unilateral adduction deficit with preserved conjugate gaze toward the lesion side.","conceptual_foundation":"One-and-a-half syndrome results from a lesion in the dorsal pontine tegmentum involving both the abducens nucleus or PPRF and the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). In ICD-11 it is classified under disorders of eye movement. Differential includes bilateral INO, gaze palsies from PPRF lesions, and lesions of the abducens nucleus.","pathophysiology":"Horizontal gaze to the left requires activation of left PPRF \u2192 left abducens nucleus \u2192 right MLF \u2192 right oculomotor nucleus. A lesion in the left PPRF or abducens nucleus abolishes leftward gaze (\u201cone\u201d). A concurrent lesion of the left MLF prevents adduction of the right eye (\u201chalf\u201d). The right abducens nucleus remains intact, permitting rightward abduction of the right eye.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients are unable to gaze toward the lesion side with both eyes. When attempting gaze contralateral to the lesion, the ipsilateral eye can abduct but the contralateral eye cannot adduct. Vertical eye movements remain normal. Diplopia is the main complaint.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by MRI of the brainstem (FLAIR/T2 hyperintensity in the dorsal pons). In MS, lesions are typically demyelinating plaques. In infarct, diffusion-weighted imaging reveals acute ischemia. CT is less sensitive for brainstem lesions.","management_principles":"In MS-related cases, treat acute demyelination with IV methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3\u20135 days).

A junctional scotoma\u2014an ipsilateral monocular scotoma plus a contralateral superior temporal quadrantanopia\u2014localizes to the junction of the optic nerve and chiasm. Compression at the chiasmal optic nerve junction (e.g., pituitary adenoma extending laterally) causes central or arcuate scotoma in the ipsilateral eye and superior temporal field defect in the opposite eye. Option A (Occipital lobe) lesions produce homonymous visual field defects (quadrantanopia or hemianopia) but always affect both eyes equally and never produce monocular scotoma. Option B (Radiation) lesions likewise cause homonymous quadrantanopia without monocular scotoma.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding visual pathways: retinal ganglion cell axons form the optic nerve, some crossing at the chiasm. Pre-chiasmal lesions produce monocular deficits; chiasmal lesions bitemporal field cuts; post-chiasmal lesions homonymous field defects. A junctional lesion at the optic nerve\u2013chiasm junction disrupts ipsilateral central fibers plus inferior decussating fibers contributing to the contralateral superior temporal field, yielding ipsilateral central scotoma with contralateral superior temporal quadrantanopia. This finding is classically seen in pituitary tumors compressing the chiasm asymmetrically.","pathophysiology":"Normal vision: temporal retina projects to nasal retinal fibers that cross in the chiasm. Lesions anterior to the chiasm affect only one eye. Lesion at the junction selectively injures central ipsilateral fibers and decussating inferior nasal fibers. Pathologically, compressive sellar masses (pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas) gradually thicken the chiasm and lead to demyelination and Wallerian degeneration. Ischemic insults are less common here. This selective fiber involvement explains the combined field defects.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with painless, slowly progressive visual field loss. They may notice a blind spot (scotoma) in one eye and difficulty with side vision in the other. On confrontation testing, an ipsilateral central scotoma and contralateral superior temporal quadrantanopia are observed. Visual acuity may be relatively preserved early. Fundoscopy is usually normal unless chronic optic atrophy develops.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010line: automated perimetry to map visual fields precisely. MRI of the brain with contrast focusing on the sellar region (sensitivity >95%, specificity ~90%) identifies pituitary masses or other compressive lesions. Visual evoked potentials may show delayed P100 latency on the affected side. Endocrine testing for pituitary function is indicated.","management_principles":"Management depends on etiology: compressive lesions often require transsphenoidal surgical decompression (Class I recommendation, Endocrine Society 2016). Radiation therapy (stereotactic) may be used for residual tumor. Medical management for prolactinomas includes dopamine agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine) with high efficacy (>70% tumor shrinkage).

VEP. Visual evoked potentials (VEP) directly assess conduction velocity along the optic nerve and optic radiations by measuring the latency and amplitude of cortical responses to visual stimuli. In acute optic neuritis, demyelination delays conduction and prolongs the P100 latency on VEP. Multiple studies demonstrate that VEP has a sensitivity of approximately 80\u201390% for detecting subclinical and clinical optic nerve demyelination (Brusa et al. 2000; Petzold et al. 2009). In contrast, brain MRI (option B) is primarily used to detect central nervous system white matter lesions characteristic of multiple sclerosis and to assess risk of future demyelinating events, but it does not directly confirm optic nerve conduction delay or the functional impairment that defines optic neuritis (Optic Neuritis Study Group 1991).","conceptual_foundation":"Optic neuritis is an acute inflammatory demyelination of the optic nerve. It is classified in ICD-11 under 8B21.0 (optic neuritis) and in DSM-5-TR contextually as a neurological disorder affecting sensory pathways. The condition lies at the intersection of neuroimmunology\u2014because of its association with multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory disorders\u2014and neuroophthalmology, given its impact on visual function. Embryologically, the optic nerve originates from the diencephalic evagination of the neural tube, and its myelin sheath is formed by oligodendrocytes, making it susceptible to immune-mediated demyelination. Anatomically, the optic nerve courses from the globe through the optic canal to the optic chiasm; demyelination anywhere along this pathway will alter the normal afferent visual signal transmission, which VEP directly measures.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, axonal conduction in the myelinated optic nerve generates synchronized action potentials with minimal delay from retina to visual cortex. In optic neuritis, autoimmune inflammatory cells\u2014primarily autoreactive T lymphocytes and macrophages\u2014target myelin antigens, leading to focal demyelination, ionic channel redistribution, and conduction block. This cellular damage reduces conduction velocity and amplitude; VEP P100 latency typically prolongs by >10 ms compared to normal controls. Secondary axonal injury can occur, resulting in reduced amplitude. In comparison, brain MRI detects changes in water content (T2 hyperintensity) but cannot quantify conduction dynamics. VEP thus provides a functional correlate to the structural lesions seen on MRI.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with optic neuritis classically present with subacute (hours to days) unilateral vision loss, periocular pain exacerbated by eye movements, and dyschromatopsia. Visual acuity at presentation ranges from 20/30 to no light perception; color vision deficits occur in >90% of cases. A relative afferent pupillary defect is present in 80\u201390%. Funduscopic exam may be normal (retrobulbar neuritis) or show optic disc edema (papillitis) in 30\u201340%. Rare presentations include bilateral involvement (especially in neuromyelitis optica), pain-free vision loss (in syphilitic optic neuropathy), and geographic variations in incidence (higher in temperate climates).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes a detailed history and ophthalmologic exam, including acuity, color vision (Ishihara plates), and swinging-flashlight test for afferent pupillary defect. VEP is the most sensitive test for confirming demyelination: P100 latency >115 ms or interocular latency difference >8 ms supports optic neuritis (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~75%). Brain MRI with gadolinium contrast is recommended by the AAN Practice Parameter (2000) to assess for white matter lesions; the presence of \u22651 T2 lesion increases 15-year MS risk from 25% to 78% (Hazard ratio 3.3). OCT (optical coherence tomography) can quantify retinal nerve fiber layer thinning but is second-tier.","management_principles":"The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) demonstrated that high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days) accelerates visual recovery (median recovery 4 weeks vs 8 weeks for placebo) but does not improve final visual outcome at 6 months or beyond. Oral prednisone alone (1 mg/kg/day) increased recurrence risk and is not recommended. In patients with MRI lesions predictive of MS, initiation of disease-modifying therapies (e.g., interferon-\u03b2) reduces the 2-year conversion rate by ~50%. Supportive measures include pain management and visual rehabilitation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes repeat neurologic evaluation and brain MRI at 6\u201312 months to monitor for new lesions. The AAN recommends annual clinical review for 5 years, as 85% of MS conversions occur within this period. OCT may be repeated at 6 months to assess axonal loss. Visual function tests should be repeated until plateau recovery, typically by 6 months. Patients should be educated on red-flag symptoms (new neurologic deficits) warranting urgent assessment.","clinical_pearls":"1. VEP prolongation is the most sensitive functional test for optic neuritis diagnosis. 2. Periocular pain exacerbated by eye movements is seen in ~90% of cases. 3. A single brain MRI lesion increases 15-year MS risk from 25% to 78%. 4. High-dose IV steroids accelerate recovery but do not change long-term outcome. 5.
