The options provided are Melxiten (meloxicam), Amantadine, IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin), and extensive physiotherapy. The correct answer is D) Extensive physiotherapy.\n\n### A) Melxiten for pain\nMeloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is effective in managing pain and inflammation. While it may provide symptom relief for shoulder pain, it does not address the underlying issues related to myotonic dystrophy, such as muscle weakness and contractures. The primary goal in managing myotonic dystrophy is to maintain functional abilities and prevent complications, which meloxicam cannot achieve alone.\n\n### B) Amantadine\nAmantadine is primarily used as an antiviral medication and is also utilized for its dopaminergic effects in conditions such as Parkinson's disease. Although it has some applications in treating fatigue associated with certain neurological disorders, it is not a primary treatment for myotonic dystrophy or shoulder pain. It does not effectively address the mechanical or muscular limitations caused by the disease.\n\n### C) IVIG\nIntravenous immunoglobulin therapy is typically reserved for autoimmune diseases and conditions involving immune deficiencies. In the context of myotonic dystrophy, there is no evidence supporting the use of IVIG as a therapeutic option. This approach would not address the patient's shoulder pain or improve muscle function.\n\n### D) Extensive physiotherapy\nExtensive physiotherapy is the most appropriate management for this patient. It aims to enhance mobility, preserve range of motion, prevent contractures, and maintain muscle strength. Physiotherapy is a critical component of care for patients with myotonic dystrophy, focusing on functional ability and quality of life. As the disease is progressive and there is no curative treatment, supportive therapies like physiotherapy become paramount in management.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nMyotonic dystrophy (MD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness, myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction), and multisystem involvement. It is divided into two main types: Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 2 (DM2), both caused by expansions of repetitive nucleotide sequences in specific genes.\n\nThe management of myotonic dystrophy is primarily symptomatic, as no disease-modifying therapies currently exist. The main goals of treatment include:\n\n- Preserving muscle function and mobility.\n- Managing symptoms such as pain and fatigue.\n- Addressing associated complications, including respiratory issues and cardiac problems.\n\nExtensive physiotherapy is critical in achieving these goals, as it aids in maintaining muscle strength, flexibility, and overall functional capability.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nMyotonic dystrophy involves genetic mutations that lead to abnormal protein production, affecting muscle function and other organ systems. The pathophysiological mechanisms include:\n\n- Dysfunction of muscle fibers: Myotonic dystrophy leads to the accumulation of abnormal RNA transcripts, which interfere with normal cellular processes. This results in impaired muscle fiber function, causing delayed relaxation after muscle contraction (myotonia) and progressive weakness.\n- Multisystem involvement: The disorder also affects the central nervous system, heart, endocrine system, and gastrointestinal tract, leading to various systemic symptoms beyond muscle weakness. For example, patients may experience cardiac arrhythmias due to conduction system abnormalities.\n- Progressive muscle degeneration: Over time, muscle fibers undergo atrophy and degeneration, contributing to weakness and functional limitations.\n\nUnderstanding these mechanisms is crucial for recognizing the importance of physiotherapy in managing the disease and its complications.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nPatients with myotonic dystrophy can present with a wide array of signs and symptoms, reflecting the multisystem nature of the disease. Common clinical manifestations include:\n\n- Myotonia: Patients may experience difficulty relaxing their muscles after contraction, which can cause stiffness and cramping.\n- Muscle weakness: This is often most pronounced in distal muscles (e.g., hands and feet) and can progress to involve proximal muscle groups over time.\n- Fatigue: Patients frequently report increased fatigue, which impacts their daily activities and overall quality of life.\n- Pain: Musculoskeletal pain, including shoulder pain, is common due to muscle imbalances and overuse.\n- Multisystem complications: These may include cardiac arrhythmias, cataracts, insulin resistance, and gastrointestinal issues.\n\nIn this scenario, the patient's shoulder pain may stem from muscle weakness, poor posture, or overuse of remaining functional muscles. Addressing this pain through physiotherapy is essential to maintain mobility and prevent further complications.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy is primarily clinical and supported by genetic testing. Key components of the diagnostic approach include:\n\n- Clinical evaluation: A thorough patient history and physical examination are essential to identify characteristic features of myotonic dystrophy, such as myotonia and muscle weakness.\n- Electromyography (EMG): EMG can help evaluate muscle function and may show myotonic discharges consistent with the diagnosis.\n- Genetic testing: Confirmation of the diagnosis is achieved through genetic testing, identifying the specific repeat expansion in the DMPK gene (for DM1) or the CNBP gene (for DM2).\n- Differential diagnosis: Other conditions that may present with similar symptoms, such as other myopathies, channelopathies, or autoimmune disorders, must be considered.\n\nBy understanding these diagnostic processes, healthcare providers can accurately identify myotonic dystrophy and tailor management strategies accordingly.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nManagement of myotonic dystrophy focuses on symptomatic relief and maintenance of function. Key management principles include:\n\n- Extensive physiotherapy: This is the cornerstone of management, aimed at preserving muscle strength, range of motion, and overall mobility. A tailored physiotherapy program may include stretching exercises, strength training, and aerobic conditioning. Regular physiotherapy sessions can help prevent contractures and promote independence in daily activities.\n- Pain management: While medications like NSAIDs can provide pain relief, they should be used as adjuncts to physiotherapy rather than primary treatments. Other pain management strategies may include physical modalities (heat, cold, ultrasound) and alternative therapies (acupuncture, massage).\n- Occupational therapy: An occupational therapist can assist in adapting daily activities and work environments to enhance functional independence and reduce the risk of injury.\n- Cardiac monitoring: Patients should undergo regular cardiac evaluations to detect arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities, which are common in myotonic dystrophy.\n- Multidisciplinary approach: Collaboration among various specialists (neurologists, physiatrists, cardiologists, and therapists) is essential for comprehensive care.\n\nThe emphasis on extensive physiotherapy reflects the need to prioritize functional outcomes and quality of life for patients with myotonic dystrophy.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nFollow-up care for patients with myotonic dystrophy involves regular monitoring and assessment of symptoms, functional capacity, and potential complications. Key aspects of follow-up include:\n\n- Regular assessments: Patients should be monitored for changes in muscle strength, mobility, and overall function. Adjustments to physiotherapy or rehabilitation programs may be necessary based on these evaluations.\n- Cardiac evaluations: Periodic electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiograms should be performed to monitor for arrhythmias or other cardiac issues.\n- Management of associated conditions: Monitoring for complications such as respiratory problems, sleep apnea, and endocrine issues (e.g., diabetes) is crucial.\n- Patient education: Providing education about the disease process, symptom management, and the importance of adherence to physiotherapy is vital for empowering patients in their care.\n\nThe prognosis for patients with myotonic dystrophy can vary widely based on the severity of symptoms and associated complications. Regular follow-up is essential in optimizing care and enhancing the quality of life.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Regular physiotherapy is essential: Emphasize the importance of ongoing physiotherapy to maintain mobility and prevent complications.\n- Monitor for cardiac issues: Be vigilant for potential cardiac arrhythmias, as they are common in myotonic dystrophy.\n- Educate patients: Provide comprehensive education to patients and their families about the disease, treatment options, and self-management strategies.\n- Multidisciplinary care: Involve a team of specialists for comprehensive management, recognizing the multisystem nature of myotonic dystrophy.\n- Individualize treatment plans: Tailor physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs to meet the specific needs and goals of each patient.\n\n## 9.

Other pain management strategies may include physical modalities (heat, cold, ultrasound) and alternative therapies (acupuncture, massage).\n- Occupational therapy: An occupational therapist can assist in adapting daily activities and work environments to enhance functional independence and reduce the risk of injury.\n- Cardiac monitoring: Patients should undergo regular cardiac evaluations to detect arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities, which are common in myotonic dystrophy.\n- Multidisciplinary approach: Collaboration among various specialists (neurologists, physiatrists, cardiologists, and therapists) is essential for comprehensive care.\n\nThe emphasis on extensive physiotherapy reflects the need to prioritize functional outcomes and quality of life for patients with myotonic dystrophy.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nFollow-up care for patients with myotonic dystrophy involves regular monitoring and assessment of symptoms, functional capacity, and potential complications. Key aspects of follow-up include:\n\n- Regular assessments: Patients should be monitored for changes in muscle strength, mobility, and overall function. Adjustments to physiotherapy or rehabilitation programs may be necessary based on these evaluations.\n- Cardiac evaluations: Periodic electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiograms should be performed to monitor for arrhythmias or other cardiac issues.\n- Management of associated conditions: Monitoring for complications such as respiratory problems, sleep apnea, and endocrine issues (e.g., diabetes) is crucial.\n- Patient education: Providing education about the disease process, symptom management, and the importance of adherence to physiotherapy is vital for empowering patients in their care.\n\nThe prognosis for patients with myotonic dystrophy can vary widely based on the severity of symptoms and associated complications. Regular follow-up is essential in optimizing care and enhancing the quality of life.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Regular physiotherapy is essential: Emphasize the importance of ongoing physiotherapy to maintain mobility and prevent complications.\n- Monitor for cardiac issues: Be vigilant for potential cardiac arrhythmias, as they are common in myotonic dystrophy.\n- Educate patients: Provide comprehensive education to patients and their families about the disease, treatment options, and self-management strategies.\n- Multidisciplinary care: Involve a team of specialists for comprehensive management, recognizing the multisystem nature of myotonic dystrophy.\n- Individualize treatment plans: Tailor physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs to meet the specific needs and goals of each patient.\n\n## 9.

There is no disease-modifying therapy; management focuses on symptomatic relief and maintenance of function. Extensive physiotherapy is recommended to preserve range of motion, prevent contractures, and maintain muscle strength. Analgesic medications like meloxicam (Melxiten) may help with pain but do not address functional limitations. Amantadine is used for fatigue in multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease, not myotonic dystrophy. IVIG is indicated for immune-mediated neuropathies (e.g., CIDP) rather than congenital myopathies. Evidence from clinical practice guidelines and expert consensus (e.g., the MDA Care Center recommendations) supports regular, tailored exercise and stretching programs for myotonic dystrophy patients to reduce stiffness, maintain mobility, and improve quality of life.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:33:58.077746","word_count":5304,"source_file":"PART I - 2024 - KSMC Revision_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuromuscular","import_source":"neuromuscular_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient came with neuropathy after a mild car accident, with PMP 22 deletion.

Which nerve is likely impaired?","options":["Suprascapular/long thoracic","Axillary and lateral antebrachial","Radial","Musculocutaneous"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Axillary and lateral antebrachial","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: combined injury to the axillary nerve (shoulder abduction weakness) and the lateral antebrachial cutaneous branch of the musculocutaneous nerve (impaired sensation in the lateral forearm), along with involvement of the superficial radial sensory branch (lateral thumb). Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy often selectively affects individual fascicles. Option A is incorrect because suprascapular or long thoracic lesions do not affect thumb sensation. Option C (radial) would cause motor deficits in wrist/finger extension, which are reported as improved. Option D (musculocutaneous) would spare shoulder abduction and thumb sensation.","conceptual_foundation":"The brachial plexus (C5\u2013T1) gives rise to the axillary nerve (C5\u2013C6) supplying deltoid and teres minor, and the musculocutaneous nerve (C5\u2013C7) whose lateral antebrachial cutaneous branch supplies lateral forearm sensation. The radial nerve (C5\u2013C8) provides superficial sensory branches to the dorsum of the thumb. Radiation plexopathy causes patchy deficits reflecting selective fascicular injury. In ICD-11, brachial plexus disorders fall under GB80. Differential includes neoplastic plexopathy and diabetic amyotrophy.","pathophysiology":"Radiation injures microvasculature and endoneurial fibroblasts within the plexus, leading to ischemia, fibrosis, and demyelination. This results in selective conduction block in the axillary and lateral antebrachial fascicles. Axillary nerve demyelination impairs deltoid function, while lateral antebrachial involvement disrupts sensory input from the forearm. Superficial radial fibers for the lateral thumb can be affected if adjacent.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present months to years post\u2013radiation with painless shoulder girdle weakness, sensory changes in specific dermatomes, and variable motor findings. Abduction strength is reduced to 4/5, and pinprick or light touch testing shows decreased sensation over the lateral forearm and thumb. Improvement of finger extension indicates sparing of deeper radial motor fibers.","diagnostic_approach":"EMG/NCS demonstrates slowed conduction velocities and axonal loss in affected nerve segments, with patchy involvement of lateral antebrachial and axillary nerves. MRI of the brachial plexus shows T2 hyperintensity and enhancement. Ultrasound can detect fascicular fibrosis. Biopsy is rarely needed. First-tier: clinical exam and EMG/NCS. Second-tier: MRI neurography. Third-tier: biopsy only if neoplastic plexopathy suspected.","management_principles":"No specific pharmacologic agents reverse radiation plexopathy; management is supportive with physical therapy to maintain range of motion and strengthen compensatory muscles. Neuropathic pain, if present, is treated with gabapentinoids. Surgical nerve transfers may be considered in selected cases with persistent functional deficits beyond 12 months (Level C evidence).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require periodic motor and sensory assessments every 3\u20136 months. Rehabilitation should be adjusted based on progression. Surgical referral if no improvement after 12 months. Long-term monitoring for late radiation effects is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. Radiation plexopathy is painless and insidious\u2014distinguishes it from neoplastic plexopathy.\n2. Shoulder abduction weakness with lateral forearm sensory loss localizes to axillary and lateral antebrachial branches.\n3. MRI neurography can differentiate radiation-induced fibrosis from tumor recurrence.\n4. Conservative therapy is mainstay; nerve transfers reserved for refractory cases.\n5.
