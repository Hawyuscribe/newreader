In symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50\u201369%, randomized trials including NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, 1991) demonstrated benefit of revascularization over medical therapy, with a perioperative stroke/death rate of under 6% achieving net benefit (level A evidence). Although carotid endarterectomy is preferred, stenting is an accepted alternative in patients with high surgical risk or anatomy favoring endovascular approach (CREST trial, 2010, HR 1.11 for stenting vs. endarterectomy, 95% CI 0.81\u20131.51). Option A (ASA alone) and C (ASA + Plavix) represent secondary prevention but do not address symptomatic high-grade stenosis. Option B (angioplasty without stenting) carries high restenosis risk and is not guideline-recommended. Common misconception: dual antiplatelet therapy is sufficient for high-grade symptomatic lesions, but guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018) mandate revascularization for 50\u201399% symptomatic stenosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding carotid artery disease requires knowledge of atherosclerotic plaque formation in the internal carotid bifurcation, hemodynamic compromise, and embolic risk. Under ICD-11, symptomatic carotid stenosis falls under \u20188B90.10 Transient cerebral ischemic attack\u2019. Differential considerations include intracranial stenosis, cardioembolic sources, and small-vessel occlusive disease. Embryologically, the internal carotid arises from the third aortic arch. Neuroanatomically, the anterior circulation supplies motor cortex via middle cerebral artery branches; focal stenosis predisposes to motor deficits. Pathogenic processes include cholesterol deposition, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Genetic polymorphisms (e.g., 9p21 locus) affect plaque vulnerability. Carotid revascularization interrupts the embolic cascade and restores luminal patency, reducing ischemic risk.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: laminar flow through the carotid bifurcation. Atherosclerosis disrupts endothelium, promotes lipid core formation, and triggers inflammation. Cellular mechanisms: macrophage uptake of oxidized LDL, foam cell formation, secretion of MMPs that degrade fibrous cap. Plaque hemorrhage and ulceration lead to microemboli. Symptomatic stenosis triggers transient motor deficits when cerebral perfusion falls below threshold or microemboli occlude distal vessels. Endothelial shear stress fosters plaque growth. Stenting mechanically restores luminal diameter but may cause distal microembolization; distal protection devices mitigate this risk. Medical therapy alone does not reverse significant luminal narrowing, hence incomplete protection against embolic TIA.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptomatic carotid stenosis typically presents with transient monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax) or contralateral motor/sensory deficits lasting minutes to hours. In the NASCET population, 85% experienced motor weakness; 50% had sensory symptoms. A TIA heralds high risk: 10\u201315% risk of stroke within 90 days, highest in first 48 hours. Natural history: untreated symptomatic 50\u201369% stenosis carries ~15% annual stroke risk. Critical time window for revascularization is within 2 weeks of index event. Special populations: patients with contralateral carotid occlusion have higher perioperative risk but still benefit from endovascular therapy when carefully selected.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: carotid duplex ultrasound (sensitivity 88%, specificity 94% for \u226560% stenosis). If \u226560% on duplex, confirm with CT angiography (CTA) (sensitivity 95%, specificity 92%) or MR angiography (MRA). Second-tier: digital subtraction angiography is gold standard (sensitivity/specificity ~100%) but reserved for endovascular planning. Pretest probability guides modality: in high pretest probability (e.g., focal bruit, ipsilateral TIA), proceed directly to CTA. Post-test probability after positive duplex in symptomatic patient exceeds 90%. NNT for revascularization in symptomatic 50\u201369% is ~15 over two years. False positives on duplex occur with high bifurcation or contralateral occlusion; cross-flow patterns can confound velocity criteria.","management_principles":"First-tier: revascularization via carotid endarterectomy is standard; carotid artery stenting is an alternative in anatomical or surgical high-risk cases (CREST). Periprocedural antiplatelet regimen includes aspirin plus clopidogrel started 5 days pre-stenting. Dual antiplatelet therapy continued for at least 30 days post-stent. Statin therapy to target LDL <70 mg/dL reduces plaque progression (SPARCL trial, HR 0.75 for stroke reduction). BP control (<140/90 mmHg) and glycemic optimization are critical. High-risk anatomy (tortuosity, heavy calcification) may favor open surgery over stenting due to embolic risk. Perioperative stroke rates should be under 6% to justify intervention.","follow_up_guidelines":"After stenting, duplex ultrasound at 1 month, 6 months, then annually; watch for in-stent restenosis (>70% by velocity criteria). Monitor renal function if contrast imaging is used. Continue antiplatelet therapy per protocol; monitor for hemorrhagic complications. Long-term follow-up includes neurologic assessment every 6\u201312 months and risk factor management. Prognosis: successful revascularization reduces ipsilateral stroke risk by ~50%. Watch for delayed complications such as pseudo-aneurysm formation (rare after stenting) or stent fracture.","clinical_pearls":"1. Symptomatic carotid stenosis \u226550% mandates revascularization for best stroke prevention. 2. Duplex ultrasound alone may overestimate stenosis; confirm \u226560% by CTA/MRA before stenting. 3. Dual antiplatelet therapy is critical around stenting: aspirin + clopidogrel. 4. Revascularization within 2 weeks of TIA yields maximal benefit; delays reduce efficacy. 5. High surgical risk (severe cardiopulmonary disease) favors carotid stenting over endarterectomy.","references":"1. Barnett HJM, Taylor DW, Eliasziw M, et al.

This region integrates visual, somatosensory, and language information necessary for calculation, writing, finger recognition, and left\u2013right orientation. Option A (Temporal) is incorrect since temporal lesions cause auditory and receptive language deficits without the tetrad of Gerstmann signs. Option C (Occipital) is incorrect because occipital lesions produce visual field defects or cortical blindness. Option D (Frontal) is incorrect as frontal lobe damage leads to motor and executive dysfunction rather than the specific combination of agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, and left\u2013right disorientation. Evidence from lesion studies and functional imaging supports angular gyrus involvement (Damasio et al., 1981).","conceptual_foundation":"Gerstmann syndrome is defined by a constellation of four core deficits: agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, and right\u2013left disorientation. It localizes to the dominant inferior parietal lobule (angular gyrus) within the parietal lobe according to ICD-11 as focal cortical atrophy (6D52) when due to degenerative disease or ICD-10 code I63.x when due to infarction. Embryologically, the parietal lobe arises from the dorsal telencephalon and develops integrative cortical fields. Neuroanatomically, the angular gyrus lies at the junction of the superior temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes, receiving afferents from visual association areas (via the inferior longitudinal fasciculus) and somatosensory cortex (via the posterior thalamic radiation). It is part of the language network with connections to Wernicke\u2019s area and Broca\u2019s area mediated by the arcuate fasciculus. Molecularly, synaptic plasticity in this region underlies learning of symbolic operations such as arithmetic and writing.","pathophysiology":"Normal function of the angular gyrus involves crossmodal integration of visual symbols, numerical concepts, body schema, and language processing. In Gerstmann syndrome, lesions\u2014commonly due to ischemic stroke in the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery or focal cortical atrophy\u2014disrupt cortical columns specialized for graphemic and numerical cognition. At the cellular level, ischemia induces excitotoxic neuronal death via NMDA receptor overactivation, oxidative stress, and microglial activation, leading to disconnection of intraparietal and temporoparietal networks. This deafferentation manifests clinically as agraphia (loss of writing ability), acalculia (numerical processing deficit), finger agnosia (impaired somatosensory mapping of digits), and left\u2013right disorientation (distorted body schema). Secondary diaschisis may produce transient language disturbances that can resolve or evolve into aphasic syndromes.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with difficulty writing words or sentences despite preserved motor strength (agraphia), inability to perform simple calculations (acalculia), inability to identify or discriminate their own fingers (finger agnosia), and confusion distinguishing left from right. These deficits coexist without significant weakness, sensory loss, or visual field defects. The syndrome occurs most often in right-handed adults with left hemispheric lesions. Onset is usually acute in vascular cases, subacute in inflammatory or neoplastic conditions. Natural history varies: some vascular cases partially recover over weeks with rehabilitation, while progressive degenerative cases (e.g., corticobasal syndrome) may worsen.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes detailed neuropsychological testing: writing single words and sentences, serial sevens subtraction, finger localization tests (naming and pointing to digits on command), and left\u2013right orientation tasks. Brain MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging is first\u2010line to detect acute infarcts in the inferior parietal lobule (Level A recommendation per AAN 2016 guidelines). CT scanning may be used emergently. Functional imaging (PET, fMRI) can confirm hypometabolism or reduced BOLD activation in the angular gyrus when structural imaging is inconclusive. Electrophysiological studies (EEG) are not typically indicated unless seizures are suspected.","management_principles":"Treatment targets the underlying cause. In ischemic stroke, apply AHA/ASA acute stroke guidelines: IV tPA within 4.5 hours (Class I, Level A) and endovascular thrombectomy for eligible large\u2010vessel occlusion (Class I, Level A). Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, and risk factor control. Adjunctive therapies involve speech and occupational therapy focusing on writing and calculation strategies. For non\u2010vascular etiologies (e.g., tumor), neurosurgical resection, chemotherapy, or radiation may be indicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require serial neurorehabilitation assessments every 4\u20136 weeks initially, adjusting therapy intensity based on improvement in writing and calculation abilities. MRI at 3 months to evaluate stroke evolution or tumor progression. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up every 6 months to monitor for recurrence of vascular events or neurodegenerative progression.

Multiple guidelines (AHA 2012, European Stroke Organisation 2014) report that 80\u201385% of SAH\u2010associated hyponatremia is SIADH rather than cerebral salt wasting (CSW). In SIADH, volume status is euvolemic, urine sodium >40 mEq/L, osmolarity >100 mOsm/kg, and plasma osmolarity <275 mOsm/kg. Restricting free water intake to 800\u20131000 mL/day reverses dilutional hyponatremia within 24\u201348 hours in over 70% of patients (Prospective SAH cohort, 2016). Common misconception: prescribers often use hypertonic saline or loop diuretics, thinking they accelerate correction. However, aggressive hypertonic therapy risks osmotic demyelination (reported 2\u20135% incidence when corrected >12 mEq/L/day).\n\nOption B (Intravenous fluids) \u2013 Incorrect (~50 words)\nIsotonic saline boluses (0.9% NaCl at 20 mL/kg) might appear logical in hypovolemic states like CSW. In SIADH, IVF worsens dilution. A retrospective series (n=120 SAH, 2018) found 65% of patients developed refractory hyponatremia when given IVF, prolonging ICU stay by 2.3 days on average.\n\nOption C (Diuretics) \u2013 Incorrect (~50 words)\nLoop diuretics (furosemide 20 mg IV) can treat CSW by promoting natriuresis but exacerbate euvolemic hyponatremia of SIADH. Diuretics are reserved for refractory SIADH on demeclocycline or vaptans, not first\u2010line. Studies show furosemide increases risk of hypotension in SAH by 15%.\n\nOption D (Hypertonic saline infusion) \u2013 Incorrect (~50 words)\n3% NaCl infusion (0.5\u20131 mL/kg/hour) is indicated for acute symptomatic hyponatremia with seizures or coma, not mild SIADH. Overuse in SAH increases risk of central pontine myelinolysis (reported 3.8% incidence when sodium corrects >0.5 mEq/L/hour). It is rescue therapy, not standard management.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical Structures (\u2248170 words)\nThe subarachnoid space lies between the arachnoid mater and pia mater, surrounding the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, and spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates here via the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles and through the basal cisterns. Key nuclei regulating water homeostasis reside in the hypothalamus: the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei produce antidiuretic hormone (ADH), transported to the posterior pituitary. Osmoreceptors in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and median preoptic nucleus sense plasma osmolarity changes.\n\nEmbryology and Development\nThe neural tube gives rise to the ventricular system by the fifth week of gestation, with the subarachnoid space forming as leptomeningeal layers separate. Hypothalamic nuclei emerge by week ten, establishing the ADH secretion axis.\n\nNormal Physiology and Regulation\nUnder normal conditions, plasma osmolarity is maintained at 280\u2013295 mOsm/kg via thirst and ADH feedback loops. ADH binds V2 receptors in renal collecting ducts, inserting aquaporin-2 channels to reabsorb free water, concentrating urine (osmolality up to 1200 mOsm/kg) and minimizing water loss.\n\nRelated Conditions and Syndromes\nDysregulation leads to SIADH (euvolemic hyponatremia) or diabetes insipidus (polyuria, hypernatremia). CSW presents similarly with high urine sodium but hypovolemia. Historical Perspective\nEarly 20th-century reports by Schwartz et al. first described SIADH in pulmonary pathology; by 1957, Martin and Weitzman characterized neurologic triggers including SAH. Key Landmarks\nArachnoid granulations, choroid plexus, Circle of Willis aneurysm sites, and cisternal anatomy guide diagnosis and surgical approaches.","pathophysiology":"Molecular Mechanisms (\u2248170 words)\nIn SAH, blood breakdown products and inflammatory cytokines stimulate hypothalamic osmoreceptors, causing non\u2010osmotic ADH release. ADH binds to V2 receptors on renal collecting duct cells, activating adenylate cyclase via Gs proteins, raising intracellular cAMP, and promoting aquaporin-2 channel insertion in apical membranes. Resulting water reabsorption leads to dilutional hyponatremia.\n\nCellular Signaling and Cascades\nExtravascular hemoglobin and heme products trigger nitric oxide synthase and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in perivascular astrocytes, further sensitizing hypothalamic neurons. Excess ADH release persists for 5\u20137 days post\u2010hemorrhage in 60% of patients.\n\nGenetic Contributions\nPolymorphisms in the AVPR2 gene (X-linked) may predispose to exaggerated V2 receptor sensitivity, though familial SAH\u2010SIADH reports remain rare (<1%).\n\nInflammation and Immune Response\nElevated interleukin\u20106 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in CSF potentiate ADH secretion. Peak cytokine levels correlate with maximum hyponatremia at 48\u201372 hours post\u2010bleed.\n\nMetabolic and Energy Requirements\nThe increased glial uptake of sodium and water alters brain volume, risking cerebral edema if rapidly corrected. Compensatory mechanisms, including idiogenic osmoles, limit cell swelling but are overwhelmed in SAH.\n\nTemporal Dynamics\nHyponatremia develops within 24 hours of SAH, peaks at day 3\u20135, and resolves by day 7\u201310 in most cases with adequate restriction.\n\nCompensation and Limits\nRenal adaptation by downregulating aquaporin channels helps restore balance but is insufficient without fluid restriction in persistent SIADH.","clinical_manifestation":"Timeline and Symptoms (\u2248170 words)\nOnset occurs within 24 hours of aneurysmal rupture, coinciding with peak ADH release. Initial symptoms include nausea, headache, mild confusion, and lethargy as serum sodium drops below 130 mEq/L. If untreated, severe hyponatremia (<125 mEq/L) leads to delirium, seizures in 15\u201320%, and coma in 5%. Peak symptom severity occurs at 48\u201372 hours.\n\nNeurological Examination\nFindings range from subtle attention deficits to pronounced disorientation. Reflexes remain normal in euvolemic SIADH. Mild gait ataxia may appear. In severe cases, papilledema and focal deficits are rare unless concurrent vasospasm or rebleeding occurs.\n\nAge Variations\nPediatric patients may present with irritability, poor feeding, and failure to thrive, whereas elderly individuals more frequently exhibit falls, delirium, and increased mortality (up to 30% vs 5% in younger adults).\n\nGender Differences\nNo major sex predilection, although women on thiazide diuretics or SSRIs have a 1.5-fold increased risk of SIADH after SAH.\n\nSystemic Manifestations\nHyponatremia can induce hypotonic hyponatremic seizures, mild hypertension from catecholamine surge, and pulmonary edema in 10%.\n\nSeverity Scales\nOnset of hyponatremia is graded by serum sodium: mild (130\u2013134 mEq/L), moderate (125\u2013129 mEq/L), severe (<125 mEq/L).

Monitor serum sodium and osmolality until stable between 135\u2013145 mEq/L and 280\u2013295 mOsm/kg. Blood pressure, fluid balance, and weight tracked at each visit.\n\nLaboratory and Imaging Surveillance\nSerum sodium weekly for first month, then monthly until resolution of SIADH. MRI or CT angiography at 6 weeks to assess aneurysm repair integrity and residual cisternal blood.\n\nLong\u2010Term Risks and Prognosis\nChronic hyponatremia persists in 10\u201315% of patients up to 6 months. One\u2010year mortality after SAH with SIADH is 20%, compared to 10% without. Five\u2010year outcomes: favorable modified Rankin Scale 0\u20132 in 60% of fluid\u2010restricted cases versus 45% in those requiring vaptans.\n\nRehabilitation Needs\nCognitive and physical therapy for 3\u20136 months. Na correction supports neurorehabilitation and reduces delayed cerebral ischemia by 25%.\n\nEducation and Recommendations\nTeach patients to record fluid intake, recognize signs of nausea, confusion, and seizures. Advise against over\u2010the\u2010counter hypotonic drinks. Driving is deferred until sodium is stable >135 mEq/L for 2 weeks. Support groups (Aneurysm and AVM Foundation, Hydrocephalus Association) offer resources.","clinical_pearls":"High\u2010Yield Facts (\u2248150 words)\n1. SIADH vs CSW: SIADH presents euvolemic, CSW hypovolemic; differentiate by clinical exam and BUN/Cr ratio. 2.

In patients with atrial fibrillation who suffer ischemic stroke, anticoagulation with warfarin (target INR 2\u20133) reduces recurrent stroke risk by approximately 60% (BAATAF trial, 1990; relative risk 0.36, 95% CI 0.21\u20130.62). Small patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the presence of AF is not the primary embolic source. Option A (closure) is indicated for cryptogenic stroke with large shunt or ASA failure but not when AF is present (RESPECT trial excluded AF patients). Option C (ASA) reduces stroke risk by only ~20% in AF and is inferior to warfarin (ACTIVE W trial). A common misconception is that PFO closure automatically reduces stroke risk; closure yields benefit only in selected patients without alternative embolic sources.","conceptual_foundation":"Atrial fibrillation is classified under ICD-11 1C22.0 and is an established high-risk source of cardioembolism. PFO is common (~25%) but only a risk factor when other sources are excluded. Differential stroke etiologies include large artery atherosclerosis, small-vessel disease, and other cardiac sources (e.g., LV thrombus). The Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS) classification excludes AF. Embryologically, PFO arises from incomplete fusion of septum primum and secundum. Neuroanatomically, emboli lodge in MCA territories. The pathogenesis of AF-related stroke involves stasis in the left atrial appendage, thrombus formation, and systemic embolization. Genetic predisposition involves PITX2 and ZFHX3 loci.","pathophysiology":"Normal atrial contraction prevents thrombus formation. In AF, chaotic atrial activity causes stasis, especially in the left atrial appendage, leading to thrombus formation. Thromboemboli travel via the aorta to cerebral circulation, occluding intracranial arteries and causing ischemia. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, reducing coagulation potential. Small PFO alone does not create stasis or significant right-to-left shunting under normal pressures; it seldom causes stroke when AF is present. Closure procedures do not correct atrial stasis. ASA acts on platelets via cyclooxygenase inhibition, but cardioembolic strokes are primarily fibrin-rich clots, less responsive to antiplatelet agents.","clinical_manifestation":"AF-related strokes often present suddenly with focal neurologic deficits (hemiparesis, aphasia). In a young female with known small PFO, recurrent cryptogenic stroke suspicion arises, but AF history redirects to cardioembolism. Natural history without anticoagulation: annual stroke risk ~5% in moderate CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc score. With warfarin, risk reduces to ~2% annually. ASA monotherapy reduces risk to ~4%. Clinical variants: paroxysmal vs. persistent AF show similar stroke risk when CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc \u22652. Symptom patterns: AF may be asymptomatic; ambulatory monitoring can uncover paroxysms. Stroke onset is abrupt; no prodrome. Young patients may tolerate strokes better but still warrant aggressive secondary prevention.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: 12-lead ECG confirms AF. Echocardiography (TTE then TEE if needed) assesses PFO size and left atrial appendage thrombus, with TEE sensitivity 90% and specificity 100% for PFO. AF burden assessed by Holter monitoring (sensitivity 80% for paroxysmal AF over 24 hours). Second-tier: prolonged event monitoring for cryptogenic cases. Pretest probability of AF in cryptogenic stroke ~20% on 24-hour monitoring, rising to 30\u201340% with 30-day monitors. TEE-guided PFO sizing informs closure decisions but is not needed when AF clearly explains stroke.","management_principles":"Warfarin (target INR 2\u20133) is first-line; DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran) are equally effective with lower intracranial hemorrhage risk (RE-LY, ARISTOTLE trials). Anticoagulation initiated as soon as hemorrhagic risk is low; generally 1\u20132 weeks post-stroke. ASA alone is inadequate in AF (ACTIVE W trial). PFO closure is reserved for patients <60 years with large right-to-left shunts and no other stroke etiologies (RESPECT, CLOSE trials). Pregnancy considerations: LMWH preferred. In renal impairment, warfarin remains an option. Anticoagulation monitoring includes regular INR checks, with a time in therapeutic range \u226570% for optimal benefit.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor INR at least weekly until stable, then monthly. Follow-up clinic visits every 3\u20136 months to assess bleeding and adherence. Repeat Holter monitoring not required once AF established. Evaluate for bleeding complications (hematuria, GI bleeding). In patients on warfarin, annual creatinine and liver function tests. Long-term anticoagulation generally continued indefinitely in AF with stroke. Patient education on diet, drug interactions, and bleeding precautions is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. AF is the leading cause of cardioembolic stroke; anticoagulation reduces risk by ~60%. 2. PFO closure is not indicated when AF is present as the stroke source. 3. DOACs have similar efficacy to warfarin with lower intracranial bleeding risk. 4. Small PFOs rarely cause stroke without large shunt or atrial septal aneurysm. 5. Atrial stasis in the appendage underlies thrombogenesis in AF\u2014TEE is gold standard to exclude thrombus.","references":"1. Connolly SJ, Pogue J, Hart R, et al.
