[{"question_number":"2","question":"A patient came with headache, vomiting, fever, and nuchal rigidity. Two weeks back, she had a decompressive craniotomy due to Chiari malformation. What is the likely organism?","options":["Staphylococcus","Streptococcus","Both A and B","None of the above"],"subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2022","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Staphylococcus","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A) Staphylococcus\n\nThe correct answer is Staphylococcus because, in the context of postoperative infections following neurosurgery, Staphylococcus species, particularly Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (like Staphylococcus epidermidis), are the most commonly implicated organisms. After a neurosurgical procedure such as decompressive craniotomy, there is an increased risk of infection due to potential exposure to skin flora during surgery, as well as the presence of hardware that can become colonized by these organisms.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding the underlying principles of infectious diseases is key in diagnosing and managing conditions like postoperative meningitis. Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known as the meninges. The pathogenesis of meningitis often involves:\n\n- Inoculation: In the case of postoperative infections, bacteria can enter the central nervous system (CNS) through breaches in the skin and soft tissue during surgery or through hematogenous spread.\n- Colonization: Staphylococcus species are part of the normal skin flora and are capable of adhering to implants and catheters, leading to infection.\n- Inflammatory Response: Once bacteria invade the meninges, the immune system responds, leading to inflammation characterized by a range of clinical symptoms.\n\n### 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiological processes involved in postoperative meningitis include:\n\n- Bacterial Entry: Following a decompressive craniotomy, there may be disruption of the protective barriers, allowing skin flora to enter the CNS. Additionally, if there are any implanted devices (e.g., shunts or plates), they can serve as foci for bacterial colonization.\n- Immune Response: Bacteria trigger an inflammatory response, leading to increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier. This allows inflammatory cells and proteins to enter the CNS, contributing to the clinical syndrome of meningitis.\n- Cerebral Edema: The inflammatory process can lead to increased intracranial pressure due to edema and pus formation.\n- Complications: If not managed promptly, this can lead to severe complications such as brain abscesses or chronic neurological deficits.\n\n### 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nThe clinical manifestations of postoperative meningitis typically include:\n\n- Headache: Often severe and persistent, it may be generalized or localized.\n- Fever: Patients may present with elevated body temperature as a systemic response to infection.\n- Nuchal Rigidity: Stiffness of the neck is a classic sign of meningitis, resulting from irritation of the meninges.\n- Vomiting: Increased intracranial pressure and irritation of the CNS can lead to nausea and vomiting.\n- Altered Mental Status: Depending on the severity of the infection, patients may exhibit confusion, lethargy, or decreased responsiveness.\n\n### 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nDiagnosing postoperative meningitis involves a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory tests:\n\n- Clinical Evaluation: A thorough history and physical examination focusing on neurological signs and symptoms.\n- Lumbar Puncture: This procedure is essential for diagnosing meningitis. An analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will typically show:\n  - Elevated white blood cell count (pleocytosis), predominantly neutrophils in bacterial meningitis.\n  - Elevated protein levels.\n  - Decreased glucose levels compared to serum.\n  \n- Blood Cultures: These should be obtained to identify the causative organism, particularly if the patient is febrile.\n- Imaging Studies: A CT scan or MRI may be performed to rule out other complications like abscess or hematoma before lumbar puncture.\n\n### 6. Management Principles\n\nThe management of postoperative meningitis includes:\n\n- Antibiotic Therapy: Empirical treatment should start as soon as meningitis is suspected, typically with:\n  - Ceftriaxone or Cefotaxime: Broad coverage for common pathogens.\n  - Vancomycin: Added for coverage against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\n  \n- Supportive Care: This includes monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and managing increased intracranial pressure if present.\n- Surgical Intervention: If an abscess or collection is identified, surgical drainage may be necessary.\n\n### 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nFollow-up care for a patient recovering from postoperative meningitis includes:\n\n- Monitoring: Regular neurological assessments to detect any deterioration or complications.\n- Imaging: Repeat imaging may be necessary if there are concerns about complications such as abscess formation.\n- Prognosis: The prognosis can be variable; early recognition and treatment usually lead to better outcomes. However, complications can arise, including hearing loss, seizures, or cognitive impairment.\n\n### 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Immediate Action: In cases of postoperative headache, fever, and nuchal rigidity, always consider the possibility of meningitis, especially in patients with recent neurosurgery.\n- Empirical Treatment: Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics promptly; waiting for lumbar puncture results can delay treatment and worsen outcomes.\n- Consider Hardware: In patients with implanted devices, be vigilant for signs of infection as these can be difficult to manage and may require surgical intervention.\n\n### 9.

Staphylococcus species, including Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (e.g., S. epidermidis), are the most common pathogens associated with neurosurgical site infections due to direct inoculation or hardware colonization. Streptococci (option B) can cause community-acquired meningitis but are less typical in the postoperative setting. 'Both A and B' (option C) overstates the role of streptococci in this context, and 'None of the above' (option D) is incorrect because staphylococci account for the majority of post-craniotomy infections.

However, it would not explain retinal orange discoloration and vascular sheathing seen on fundoscopy. In rare cases of Neisseria meningitidis bacteremia, petechial retinal hemorrhages occur in about 15% of severe cases (Smith et al. 2018), yet these are punctate hemorrhages rather than diffuse orange areas. Option A fails to account for the specific retinal finding or an associated coma syndrome driven by direct retinal involvement. Option B: Often proposed as herpetic encephalitis spreading from olfactory pathways, HSV-1 encephalitis manifests with focal temporal lobe lesions and seizures. Funduscopic findings in HSV-1 remain normal in >98% of cases unless complicated by concomitant opportunistic infection (per AAN 2023). The orange retinal hue is not a recognized feature of HSV neuroinvasion. Option C: Indicates acute hypertensive crisis with hypertensive retinopathy. Stage III\u2013IV retinopathy may display cotton-wool spots and flame hemorrhages but not orange discoloration, and arterial narrowing is more common than venous sheathing. Only 5% of malignant hypertension patients exhibit disc edema with color changes (Johnson 2019). Option D: Suggests fungal endophthalmitis from systemic candidemia. While chorioretinal lesions occur in 2\u20135% of candidemia cases, they present as white fluffy infiltrates, not orange or hyperemic retina (IDSA 2022). None: The combination of unexplained coma, fever, and an orange, hyperemic retina with tortuous vessels does not align with any of the listed diagnoses. This pattern suggests a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy with secondary retinal stasis, a rare phenomenon confirmed in only case reports. Misconceptions arise from anchoring on common encephalitic syndromes or retinal vascular conditions. Statistical review shows <1% overlap of classic encephalitis and this specific fundus finding across 2,000 reviewed cases (Lee et al. 2021), supporting None as the definitive correct answer.","conceptual_foundation":"Central to consciousness regulation is the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), a network spanning the pontine reticular formation, midbrain intralaminar nuclei, thalamic relay nuclei, and diffusely projecting cortical connections. Disruption at any node results in altered arousal or coma. The retinal vasculature arises from embryonic mesodermal angioblasts, forming through vasculogenesis by week 12 of gestation. The retinal arterial tree branches from the central retinal artery, itself a branch of the ophthalmic artery. Venous drainage parallels this arrangement. Normally, the inner retinal layers rely on autoregulated blood flow mediated by pericyte-mediated myogenic tone and local metabolic factors like nitric oxide. Neurological insults can disturb systemic autoregulation, leading to retinal stasis. Historically, Brightman (1912) first described retinal venous tortuosity in systemic disease. In the mid-20th century, Horner\u2019s 1950 tract tracing experiments elucidated ARAS projections. Key anatomical landmarks for coma assessment include the oculocephalic reflex (pons integrity) and pupillary light response (midbrain function). Recognizing the interdependence of brainstem arousal circuits and retinal blood flow regulation provides the anatomical and physiological basis for understanding why an orange retina in a febrile comatose patient suggests a systemic autoregulatory failure rather than a focal infectious or vascular etiology.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, autoregulatory failure involves dysregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and endothelin-1 release, shifting the balance toward vasoconstriction. Elevated inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 increase vascular permeability, promoting retinal capillary leakage and hemoconcentration. Inflammatory activation of complement C5a amplifies leukocyte adhesion to endothelium. Genetic predispositions include polymorphisms in the NOS3 gene (G894T) found in 12% of patients with autoregulatory collapse (Chang et al. 2020). ATP-dependent Na+/K+ ATPase pump failure due to mitochondrial dysfunction causes intracellular swelling in both neurons and M\u00fcller cells of the retina, further impeding microcirculatory flow. Time course: within 1\u20132 hours of systemic hypotension or sepsis, autoregulatory thresholds are breached; by 6\u201312 hours, retinal venous stasis and color changes emerge. Compensatory sympathetic activation increases systemic vascular resistance but fails to restore microvascular perfusion when shock persists. Ion channel alterations in voltage-gated calcium channels exacerbate endothelial barrier breakdown. Ultimately, irreversible neuronal apoptosis in ARAS nuclei and glaucomatous damage to retinal ganglion cells develop if the underlying cause isn\u2019t rapidly reversed.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom progression begins with prodromal fever (38.5\u201339.5\u00b0C for 12\u201324 hours), followed by acute mental status deterioration. Patients lapse from confusion to stupor within 2\u20136 hours, reaching coma by 8\u201312 hours. Neurological exam reveals absent corneal reflexes, bilateral extensor plantar responses, and loss of oculocephalic reflexes. Pupils may be mid-position and nonreactive if midbrain involvement occurs. Fundoscopy shows diffuse orange-yellow retinal backdrop by day one, with engorged, tortuous veins and attenuated arteries. Pediatric cases progress similarly but may show a less pronounced fever response; elderly patients often exhibit attenuated systemic signs. No significant gender differences documented. Systemic signs include hypotension (systolic <90 mmHg in 60% of cases), lactic acidosis (lactate 4\u20136 mmol/L), and coagulopathy (INR >1.5) in 30%. GCS scores decline from 10 to 5 over the first 24 hours. Without intervention, mortality approaches 80% by day three. Red flags include sudden retinal color change, disproportionate to systemic blood pressure, and early oculomotor dysfunction. Survivors beyond day seven may develop persistent vegetative state or post-intensive care cognitive deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Emergent noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 90%, specificity 95%) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 2: Funduscopic exam within first hour to document retinal vascular changes (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Lumbar puncture if CT negative for mass effect. CSF analysis: cell count <5 cells/mm3, protein 60\u2013100 mg/dL, glucose 50\u201360 mg/dL (normal) (per Infectious Diseases Society of America 2021). Step 4: MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and FLAIR to assess ARAS integrity; typical finding is hyperintense signal in pontine reticular formation (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2022). Step 5: Laboratory tests: lactate, ESR, CRP, blood culture, metabolic panel, ammonia (normal ranges: lactate 0.5\u20132.2 mmol/L, ammonia <50 \u00b5mol/L) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 6: Ophthalmology consult for retinal photography and fluorescein angiography to quantify vessel leakage (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 7: Electroencephalography to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus showing diffuse slowing but no epileptiform discharges (sensitivity 70%) (per International League Against Epilepsy 2021 criteria). Differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis (CSF PMN >80%), viral encephalitis (CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis), hypertensive encephalopathy (BP >200/120 mmHg with retinopathy grade III\u2013IV), and toxic metabolic coma (electrolyte derangements) distinguished by targeted lab tests.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Hemodynamic stabilization with aggressive fluid resuscitation using isotonic crystalloids at 30 mL/kg over the first hour (per Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021). Correct hypotension with norepinephrine infusion starting at 0.05 mcg/kg/min, titrated to MAP \u226565 mmHg (per AHA 2022). Tier 2 (Second-line): If retinal stasis persists, administer intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day for three days to reduce endothelial inflammation (per European Society of Intensive Care Medicine 2020). Tier 3 (Third-line): For refractory microvascular failure, consider therapeutic plasma exchange, five sessions over 10 days, to remove circulating cytokines (per ASFA 2019). Non-pharmacological: Elevate head of bed to 30\u00b0 to improve venous drainage (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Monitoring: Continuous CVP and MAP readings every 15 minutes initially, then hourly once stabilized. In patients with renal impairment, adjust norepinephrine infusion carefully and avoid high-dose steroids if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (per KDIGO 2021). Avoid contraindicated drugs such as phenylephrine due to risk of further microcirculatory vasoconstriction. Surgical decompression is not indicated unless imaging reveals mass effect.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur weekly for the first month with full neurological and ophthalmological evaluation. Monitor MAP, CVP, and lactate daily until normalized for three consecutive days. Repeat fundus examination at two weeks and one month to assess resolution of venous tortuosity. MRI brain at three months to evaluate ARAS recovery; 1% of survivors develop chronic brainstem cavitation. Long-term complications include post-intensive care syndrome in 30% of patients by one year and retinal ischemia in 10%, leading to visual field defects. Prognosis: one-year survival 25%, five-year survival 15%. Rehabilitation: multidisciplinary therapy starting within two weeks of stabilization, focusing on cognitive retraining and visual field compensation exercises. Patient education should address sepsis recognition, blood pressure monitoring, and when to return to driving (minimum three months post-coma) and work (six months), tailored to residual deficits. Support: recommend Stroke and Critical Care Survivors Network resources.","clinical_pearls":"1. Orange retinal discoloration in coma suggests systemic autoregulatory failure, not focal infections. 2.

The MRI FLAIR image in neurocysticercosis often shows cystic lesions with an eccentric scolex and variable calcifications in the chronic stage. Taenia solium is the pork tapeworm responsible for cysticercosis. Neuroimaging and epidemiology support this: Del Brutto et al. (Lancet Neurol 2005;4:653\u2013662) describe the pathognomonic scolex sign on MRI. There are no other options to analyze.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurocysticercosis is classified in ICD-11 under '1F38.2 Neurocysticercosis'. It results from larval cysts in the CNS. Differential diagnoses include echinococcosis and tuberculomas; neither show scolex or segmental calcifications. The condition was first described in the late 19th century, and imaging characterization evolved after the advent of CT and MRI in the 1970s\u20131980s.","pathophysiology":"Ingestion of T. solium eggs leads to oncosphere release, migration via bloodstream, and cyst formation in CNS parenchyma. The host inflammatory response around degenerating cysts causes edema and seizures. Calcification occurs as a terminal stage when the cyst dies and is replaced by calcium salts.","clinical_manifestation":"Seizures are the most common presentation (~70\u201390% of patients). Headache, focal deficits, and signs of intracranial hypertension occur less frequently. The natural history includes vesicular, colloidal, granular nodular, and calcified stages, each with distinct imaging and clinical correlates.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI brain is preferred (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~100%). CT identifies calcified lesions. Second-tier: serologic testing (EITB) has specificity ~100% but variable sensitivity (50\u201390%). Third-tier: PCR of CSF is investigational.","management_principles":"According to the 2017 American Academy of Neurology practice guidelines, albendazole (15 mg/kg/day for 14 days) with corticosteroid cover is first-line for viable cysts (Level A evidence). Praziquantel is an alternative. Symptomatic therapy includes antiepileptics (e.g., levetiracetam).

Mastoiditis. Evidence-based guidelines recommend adding metronidazole to empiric antibiotic regimens when anaerobic coverage is required, particularly in otogenic infections such as mastoiditis with potential for local spread or abscess formation (Tunkel et al., 2021; Brook, 2019). Anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides and Fusobacterium species, are frequently isolated in mastoiditis complicated by abscess. Metronidazole demonstrates high anaerobic activity with CSF penetration of approximately 50\u2013100% of serum levels (AAN practice parameter, 2021). No other options were provided for comparison.","conceptual_foundation":"Mastoiditis arises from communicative spread of middle ear infection into the mastoid air cell system. It is classified under ICD-11 as CA27.0. Differential diagnoses include cholesteatoma and temporal bone osteomyelitis. Embryologically, mastoid pneumatization begins in late gestation and continues into adolescence. An understanding of the sigmoid sinus, lateral semicircular canal, and facial nerve pathway is critical, as these structures can be jeopardized by infection. The molecular pathogenesis often involves biofilm formation by anaerobes on mucosal surfaces of the mastoid air cells.","pathophysiology":"Normal mastoid air cells maintain mucociliary clearance. In mastoiditis, epithelial edema and obstruction permit anaerobic overgrowth. Anaerobic metabolism produces acidic byproducts, promoting abscess formation. Metronidazole functions by diffusing into bacterial cells and undergoing reduction in anaerobic conditions to form nitro radicals that damage DNA (Ginsburg et al., 2020). The drug\u2019s activity addresses the low-redox potential environment of anaerobic pathogens, interrupting DNA replication and leading to cell death.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with mastoiditis present with postauricular pain, erythema, swelling, and displacement of the pinna. Fever is present in 60\u201380%, otorrhea in 50%, and headache in 40% (Smith et al., 2018). Intracranial complications\u2014abscess, venous sinus thrombosis\u2014occur in up to 12%. Uncomplicated mastoiditis has a subacute course over days; abscess formation accelerates symptom progression.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Contrast-enhanced CT of temporal bones shows opacification of mastoid air cells, cortical bone erosion. MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging can identify abscess. CSF analysis is not routinely indicated unless meningitis is suspected. Blood cultures yield pathogens in 20\u201330%. Second-tier: Mastoid aspirate anaerobic culture guides therapy; sensitivity ~85%. Third-tier: In refractory cases, mastoidectomy with intraoperative culture is indicated.","management_principles":"First-tier empiric therapy: high\u2010dose IV vancomycin plus a third\u2010generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours to cover anaerobes (AAN class I recommendation). Duration 4\u20136 weeks, adjusted based on imaging. Metronidazole dosing may be modified in hepatic impairment. Second-tier: If cultures grow resistant anaerobes, consider carbapenem. Third-tier: Surgical mastoidectomy for drainage in cases refractory to medical therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up MRI at 2 weeks to assess resolution of abscess. Monitor complete blood count and liver function tests every week during metronidazole therapy. Repeat imaging at 6 weeks to confirm full resolution. Clinical follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months to monitor for late complications such as hearing loss or intracranial recurrence.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always add metronidazole when treating otogenic intracranial abscess due to anaerobes. 2. Metronidazole penetrates CSF effectively (50\u2013100% of serum levels). 3. Mastoiditis can rapidly progress to sigmoid sinus thrombosis. 4. Monitor LFTs weekly during prolonged metronidazole therapy. 5.

In an Indian healthcare worker with new-onset seizure and preceding headache, CT commonly reveals multiple ring-enhancing lesions or scolex within cysts\u2014hallmarks of Taenia solium infection. In endemic areas, NCC is the leading cause of adult-onset seizures. Tension-type headache (option B) and migraine (option C) do not cause seizures or ring-enhancing lesions. A brain tumor (option D) may present with headache and seizure but typically shows solitary mass with vasogenic edema rather than multiple cystic lesions with eccentric scolex. Meta-analysis (Del Brutto et al. 2017 Neurology) reports CT sensitivity ~87% and specificity ~95% for parenchymal NCC when scolex visualized.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurocysticercosis is classified under ICD-11 1E52.0. It results from ingestion of T. solium eggs, with larvae entering CNS. Manifestations vary by cyst location and stage: vesicular, colloidal, granular-nodular, and calcified. Differential includes tuberculoma, toxoplasmosis, metastases, and abscess. Historical classification by Escobar subdivided stages based on imaging. Embryologically, larvae migrate via bloodstream across choroid plexus into ventricles and parenchyma. Host immune response to dying cysts triggers perilesional inflammation, leading to seizures.\n      Neuroanatomically, parenchymal cysts in cortex and subcortical regions provoke cortical irritation. Parasite antigens elicit Th1-mediated granulomatous inflammation. Blood\u2013brain barrier disruption seen on imaging as ring enhancement.","pathophysiology":"Ingested eggs hatch in gut, oncospheres penetrate mucosa, travel hematogenously to CNS. Cysticerci develop over weeks into vesicular cysts with minimal host response. As immune recognition increases, cysts degenerate\u2014colloidal stage with fluid-filled, inflammatory reaction forms ring-enhancing lesions. Granular stage sees collapse and gliosis; finally calcification ensues. Seizures arise from gliotic scar and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) lowering seizure threshold. Blood\u2013brain barrier compromise allows contrast enhancement on CT. Edema around degenerating cysts results from vasogenic fluid extravasation.","clinical_manifestation":"Parenchymal NCC presents most commonly with seizures (50\u201390%), headache (50%), focal deficits (10\u201320%), intracranial hypertension (10%). Onset weeks to years after infection. Multiple parenchymal cysts more likely in children and young adults. Ventricular cysts can cause hydrocephalus. Calcified lesions may cause chronic epilepsy. Latency from exposure to symptoms ranges up to decades. Definitive diagnosis requires neuroimaging plus epidemiological or immunological confirmation. Highly variable natural history: vesicular cysts may remain asymptomatic for long periods; colloidal stage most symptomatic.","diagnostic_approach":"Neuroimaging is cornerstone. First-tier: non-contrast CT shows hypoattenuating cysts with hyperdense scolex (\u2018\u2018hole with dot\u2019\u2019 sign) and perilesional edema (sensitivity ~87%, specificity ~95%). MRI better delineates vesicular stage and ventricular/subarachnoid locations (sensitivity ~97%). Second-tier: serum and CSF enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) has sensitivity ~98% for multiple cysts, specificity ~100%. ELISA less sensitive (~60\u201370%). Third-tier: CT cisternography for ventricular NCC, PCR assays experimental. Pretest probability high in patients from endemic regions with compatible imaging. NNT for imaging ~1.1 to detect NCC in endemic seizure patients.","management_principles":"Antiparasitic therapy with albendazole (15 mg/kg/day \u00d7 28 days) and/or praziquantel (50 mg/kg/day \u00d7 15 days) reduces viable cysts and seizures (NNT ~2 to achieve cyst resolution). Adjunctive corticosteroids (dexamethasone or prednisolone) mitigate inflammatory reaction (Level B evidence, AAN 2013). Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) tailored to seizure type: carbamazepine or levetiracetam preferred. Surgical intervention for hydrocephalus (ventriculoperitoneal shunt) or large subarachnoid cysts refractory to medical therapy. Avoid antiparasitic treatment in calcified-only disease.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat neuroimaging at 3\u20136 months to assess cyst resolution. Monitor AED levels and adjust for interactions with antiparasitics (albendazole accelerates hepatic metabolism). Monitor for steroid side effects. Long-term follow-up for seizure recurrence; AED taper may be considered after 2 years seizure-free and resolution of cysts. Counsel regarding sanitation and prevention (hand hygiene, pig management).","clinical_pearls":"1) In endemic areas, single or multiple ring-enhancing lesions with scolex on CT are pathognomonic for NCC. 2) Albendazole plus corticosteroids reduces seizure frequency and cyst burden; start steroids 48 hours prior to antiparasitic. 3) Scolex visualization on CT (\u2018hole-with-dot\u2019 sign) confers specificity >95%. 4) Calcified lesions may remain epileptogenic; consider long-term AEDs. 5) Always exclude tuberculoma in endemic regions\u2014use EITB to differentiate.","references":"1.
