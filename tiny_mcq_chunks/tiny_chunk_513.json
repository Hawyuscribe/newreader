[{"question_number":"8","question":"What virus is most commonly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS)?","options":["HSV","EBV"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"EBV","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV). Multiple epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated a near\u2010universal history of EBV infection in patients with multiple sclerosis compared with controls. A large prospective US military cohort showed that seroconversion to EBV conferred a 32\u2010fold increase in MS risk (Harley et al., 2021, Science). By contrast, HSV (option A) has not been consistently associated with MS in large cohort or case\u2013control studies; seroprevalence of HSV is similar in MS patients and the general population, and no prospective data show HSV seroconversion preceding MS onset. Common misconceptions include conflating neurotropic viruses in general with EBV specifically, but only EBV shows the strong risk association published in AAN practice guidelines (2020).","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic immune\u2010mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system classified in ICD\u201011 under 8A40. The current model of MS pathogenesis posits that environmental triggers such as viral infections (most notably EBV) in genetically susceptible individuals lead to autoreactive T and B cells crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier and targeting myelin antigens. EBV infects B cells and induces latency proteins (EBNA2) that overlap with MS risk loci (Harley et al., 2021). Differential considerations include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and CNS lupus, which have distinct serologic markers (AQP4\u2010IgG, ANA/dsDNA respectively).","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, EBV infection is controlled by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In MS, EBV\u2013infected B cells may persist in the CNS meninges and perivascular spaces, presenting autoantigens and driving chronic inflammation. Molecular mimicry between EBV nuclear antigens and myelin basic protein has been proposed. Autoreactive CD4+ T cells recognize EBV\u2010infected B cells that infiltrate the CNS, triggering local demyelination via microglial activation and complement deposition. This process leads to focal plaques of myelin loss and relative axonal preservation in early disease.","clinical_manifestation":"MS typically presents in young adults (20\u201340 years) with relapsing\u2010remitting neurological deficits, such as optic neuritis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and limb paresthesia. Fatigue and heat sensitivity are common. The natural history without treatment is one relapse every 1\u20132 years, with gradual accumulation of disability. Diagnostic criteria require dissemination in space and time (2017 McDonald criteria), with MRI demonstrating enhancing and nonenhancing lesions.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier investigations include brain MRI with and without contrast (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~75% for McDonald criteria). CSF analysis shows oligoclonal bands in 85\u201390% of MS patients (AAN guideline, 2018, Level B). Evoked potentials may reveal subclinical demyelination. Second\u2010tier tests include serum aquaporin\u20104 and MOG\u2010IgG to exclude NMOSD and MOG\u2010associated disease. Diagnostic pitfalls include misinterpreting nonspecific white matter lesions in migraine or small\u2010vessel ischemic disease.","management_principles":"Initial management of relapsing\u2010remitting MS includes high\u2010efficacy DMTs such as interferon\u2010\u03b2, glatiramer acetate (first-line, Class I evidence), and more recently anti\u2010CD20 therapies (ocrelizumab) for active disease (AAN 2020, Class I). Alemtuzumab is reserved for refractory cases. Acute relapses are treated with high\u2010dose IV corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3\u20135 days). Emerging treatments target B cells and the IL-2 receptor (daclizumab extraneural).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients on DMT require clinical follow\u2010up every 3\u20136 months, annual MRI to monitor silent disease activity, and periodic laboratory monitoring for drug\u2010specific toxicities (e.g., CBC, liver function, immunoglobulin levels). Treatment duration is individualized; discontinuation in stable patients remains controversial. Prognostic factors include early relapse frequency and lesion burden on MRI.","clinical_pearls":"1. EBV seronegative status is virtually never seen in MS (seroconversion precedes onset). 2. Oligoclonal bands in CSF are supportive but not pathognomonic. 3. MRI lesion dissemination in time can be shown by simultaneous enhancing and non-enhancing lesions. 4. Vitamin D insufficiency may modulate risk but is not causal. 5. EAE in animal models replicates key features of human MS, supporting immune-mediated pathogenesis.","references":"1. Harley JB, Liu X, Raj T, et al. The role of EBV in MS.

Alemtuzumab is a humanized anti\u2010CD52 monoclonal antibody used as a high\u2010efficacy DMT in relapsing\u2010remitting MS. Its known adverse effects include secondary autoimmune cytopenias, most commonly immune thrombocytopenia presenting with low platelets and mucocutaneous bleeding or rash. Ofatumumab (option A) is an anti\u2010CD20 agent with a favorable safety profile and does not typically cause thrombocytopenia or skin rash as an immune\u2010mediated effect.","conceptual_foundation":"Alemtuzumab is indicated for active MS in patients with inadequate response to at least one DMT (AAN 2020).

The mechanism predisposes to secondary autoimmunity in ~30% of patients, including thyroid disease and immune thrombocytopenic purpura.","pathophysiology":"Alemtuzumab depletes circulating T and B lymphocytes, leading to homeostatic proliferation during reconstitution. Dysregulated B\u2010cell repopulation in the absence of regulatory T cells may trigger autoreactive clones. In immune thrombocytopenia, anti\u2010platelet autoantibodies opsonize platelets, leading to splenic macrophage clearance and mucocutaneous bleeding. Cutaneous manifestations may include petechiae or purpura due to low platelet count and immune complex deposition.","clinical_manifestation":"Immune thrombocytopenia typically arises 2\u201316 months post alemtuzumab infusion. Patients present with platelet counts <30\u2009\u00d710^9/L, petechiae, ecchymoses, and occasionally mucosal bleeding. Skin rashes in alemtuzumab treatment can also represent drug\u2010related mild exanthems but must be distinguished from ITP. In contrast, ofatumumab\u2019s common adverse events are injection\u2010site reactions and mild infections, not cytopenias.","diagnostic_approach":"Patients on alemtuzumab with rash and thrombocytopenia warrant CBC with peripheral smear to confirm isolated thrombocytopenia, and antiplatelet antibody testing. Bone marrow biopsy is reserved for atypical features. Regular monitoring per prescribing information mandates monthly CBC for 48 months post last infusion to detect ITP early.","management_principles":"For immune thrombocytopenia, initial management follows ITP guidelines: corticosteroids (prednisone 1\u2009mg/kg/day), IVIg if bleeding is severe, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists for refractory cases. Alemtuzumab\u2010induced ITP responds well to standard ITP therapy; splenectomy is rarely required. Alemtuzumab dosing for MS is two courses of 12\u2009mg/day for 5\u2009days and 12\u2009mg/day for 3\u2009days one year later.","follow_up_guidelines":"After alemtuzumab infusion, monthly CBC must be obtained for 48 months to screen for ITP.

Natalizumab\u2010associated PML arises from JC virus reactivation due to impaired CNS immune surveillance. Upon PML diagnosis, immediate discontinuation of natalizumab is mandatory to restore \u03b14\u2010integrin\u2013mediated lymphocyte trafficking into the CNS, curtail further viral replication, and improve clinical outcomes (Bloomgren et al., 2012; Clifford et al., 2017). Continuing natalizumab would exacerbate immunosuppression and worsen demyelination. No other answer choices were provided for direct comparison.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system characterized by perivenular inflammatory infiltrates of autoreactive T and B lymphocytes. Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the \u03b14 subunit of \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin (VLA\u20104) on lymphocytes, blocking their adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (VCAM\u20101) and preventing migration across the blood\u2013brain barrier (Polman et al., 2006). While natalizumab reduces annualized relapse rates by ~68% and new MRI lesion formation by ~92%, it disrupts immune surveillance within the CNS and predisposes to opportunistic infections\u2014most notably progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus (Major, 2010). Understanding the mechanism of leukocyte trafficking and the interplay between DMT\u2010induced immunosuppression and viral reactivation is key to recognizing and managing natalizumab\u2010associated PML.","pathophysiology":"The JC polyomavirus infects 50\u201380% of adults, establishing latency in kidneys, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues. In immunocompetent individuals, T\u2010cell\u2013mediated immunity prevents viral reactivation. Natalizumab\u2019s blockade of \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin inhibits CNS entry of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, diminishing surveillance of latent JC virus in oligodendrocytes. Reactivation leads to productive infection of oligodendrocytes, causing lytic cell death, multifocal demyelination, and axonal loss. Histopathology reveals enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with basophilic viral inclusions and bizarre astrocytes with minimal inflammatory infiltrate (Major, 2010). Discontinuation of natalizumab restores lymphocyte trafficking, but sudden immune reconstitution can precipitate IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome), which manifests as contrast enhancement and edema around PML lesions on MRI (Tan & Koralnik, 2010).","clinical_manifestation":"Natalizumab\u2010associated PML typically presents subacutely over weeks to months with new focal neurological deficits. Common symptoms include hemiparesis (~50%), visual field defects (~30\u201350%), cognitive impairment (~40%), ataxia, and aphasia (Yousry et al., 2012). On MRI, PML lesions appear as asymmetric, confluent T2/FLAIR hyperintense areas in subcortical white matter without mass effect or ring enhancement initially; enhancement may develop later with IRIS (Koralnik, 2014). The median time to PML onset is approximately 28 months after initiating natalizumab, with significantly higher risk beyond 24 months of therapy and in patients with an anti\u2013JC virus antibody index >1.5 (Bloomgren et al., 2012).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of PML relies on clinical suspicion in natalizumab\u2010treated, anti\u2013JC virus antibody\u2013positive patients presenting with new neurologic deficits and characteristic MRI lesions. First-tier evaluation includes MRI with FLAIR and diffusion\u2010weighted imaging (sensitivity >95%). CSF JC virus DNA PCR has a sensitivity of 75\u201389% and specificity >95% (Tan et al., 2010); a negative initial PCR does not rule out PML, and repeat testing after 2\u20134 weeks is recommended if clinical and radiologic suspicion remains high. Brain biopsy remains the gold standard but is reserved for equivocal cases. Pre-test probability is high when treatment duration exceeds 24 months and anti\u2013JC virus antibody index is elevated.","management_principles":"Immediate discontinuation of natalizumab is the cornerstone of management. Plasma exchange (PLEX) or immunoadsorption accelerates drug clearance, reducing natalizumab half\u2010life from ~11 days to 2\u20133 days, thereby restoring CNS immune surveillance more rapidly (Tan et al., 2011). No antiviral agent has proven efficacy; mirtazapine and cidofovir have been used off\u2010label without robust evidence. Supportive care includes physical and occupational therapy. Monitoring for and managing IRIS\u2014occurring in up to 70% of cases post\u2010natalizumab removal\u2014is essential; high\u2010dose corticosteroids are used for severe IRIS (Clifford et al., 2017).","follow_up_guidelines":"After natalizumab discontinuation and PLEX, patients should undergo serial MRI every 4\u20136 weeks to monitor PML lesion evolution and detect IRIS. CSF JC virus PCR may be repeated monthly to confirm viral clearance. Neurological examinations (e.g., EDSS scores) should be performed monthly during acute management and then quarterly. IRIS management may require corticosteroid tapering over 4\u20138 weeks. Once PML stabilizes, alternative MS therapies with lower PML risk should be considered. Long-term follow-up includes neurocognitive testing, rehabilitation, and monitoring for MS reactivation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Risk stratification: Anti\u2013JC virus antibody index >1.5, prior immunosuppressant use, and natalizumab therapy >24 months confer highest PML risk. 2.

Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against \u03b14\u2010integrin that impairs leukocyte trafficking across the blood\u2013brain barrier, increasing the risk of JC virus reactivation and PML (Bloomgren et al. 2012, N Engl J Med). Plasmapheresis rapidly removes natalizumab from the circulation (median half\u2010life reduction from ~249 hours to ~2\u201311 days), restoring immune surveillance in the CNS and enabling viral clearance. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has no proven efficacy in natalizumab\u2010associated PML and does not accelerate drug clearance. High\u2010dose steroids can exacerbate immunosuppression and worsen PML; they are only indicated if immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) occurs after plasmapheresis. Continuing natalizumab (option D) would further impair CNS immunity and is contraindicated in active PML. Thus, plasmapheresis is the evidence\u2010based intervention to remove natalizumab and initiate immune reconstitution.","conceptual_foundation":"Natalizumab is indicated for relapsing\u2010remitting multiple sclerosis and prevents lymphocyte entry into the CNS by blocking \u03b14\u2010integrin\u2013VCAM\u20101 interactions (AAN practice parameter, 2013). Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is caused by JC polyomavirus infection of oligodendrocytes, leading to demyelination. In ICD\u201011, PML falls under \u20188A23.0\u2019 (Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). The key differential diagnoses include MS relapse, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and CNS lymphoma. Historically, withdrawal of immunosuppression was the only strategy; the advent of plasma exchange marked a major advance by shortening drug half\u2010life and restoring CNS immune function (St\u00fcve et al. 2009, Arch Neurol). Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from neuroectodermal precursors in the ventral neural tube. The concept underscores how blocking leukocyte trafficking can inadvertently disable CNS viral surveillance.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, circulating T lymphocytes patrol the CNS via \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin interactions with endothelial VCAM\u20101. Natalizumab binds \u03b14\u2010integrin, preventing diapedesis of T cells into the brain. In the absence of immune surveillance, latent JC virus in oligodendrocytes reactivates, replicates, and causes focal demyelination. Plasmapheresis physically removes natalizumab from plasma, restoring T\u2010cell trafficking. The rebound of T\u2010cell activity can lead to IRIS, characterized by an inflammatory response against JC virus\u2013infected cells. IRIS pathophysiology involves cytokine release (IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1) and enhanced blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, often necessitating steroids for management.","clinical_manifestation":"Natalizumab\u2010associated PML typically presents subacutely over weeks with cognitive impairment (60\u201370%), hemiparesis (30\u201350%), visual field deficits (25\u201340%), and ataxia (20\u201330%) (Khatri et al. 2015, Neurology). Symptoms often progress over 2\u20136 weeks. MRI shows multifocal, nonenhancing T2/FLAIR white matter lesions without mass effect. Prodromal headaches or confusion occur in ~15%. Untreated, median survival is ~2\u20136 months; with plasmapheresis and IRIS management, 1\u2010year survival improves to ~70%.

In a patient presenting with a first episode of unilateral optic neuritis and an MRI demonstrating three supracortical demyelinating lesions, the diagnosis remains a CIS because dissemination in time has not yet been demonstrated despite dissemination in space on imaging. According to the 2017 McDonald criteria (Thompson et al., Lancet Neurol 2018), the presence of \u22652 T2 lesions in characteristic locations (periventricular, juxtacortical/supracortical, infratentorial, or spinal cord) meets dissemination in space, but dissemination in time requires either a new clinically silent lesion on follow-up MRI or simultaneous presence of enhancing and nonenhancing lesions. Here, only an initial MRI is available without contrast timing or serial imaging; hence, we cannot confirm dissemination in time, precluding a diagnosis of MS.\n\nOption B (MS) is incorrect because multiple sclerosis requires both dissemination in space and time, which has not been definitively demonstrated. Option C (optic neuritis) describes the presenting syndrome but does not incorporate the MRI findings or broader diagnostic framework; it is an anatomical description, not a nosological entity in this context. Therefore, CIS is the best descriptor for a first demyelinating event with objective MRI evidence but without proven dissemination in time.","conceptual_foundation":"Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) refers to a first clinical demyelinating episode lasting at least 24 hours, suggestive of multiple sclerosis but without fulfillment of criteria for definitive MS. Under ICD-11, CIS falls under 8A04.0 \u2018Acute disseminated encephalitis\u2019, though in practice it is treated as an early demyelinating event on the MS spectrum. Differential diagnoses include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and other inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, or neoplastic processes that can mimic demyelination. Historically, CIS was not distinguished from MS until imaging and immunological refinements demonstrated that early intervention in CIS could alter long-term outcomes. Embryologically, optic nerve myelination begins around 32 weeks\u2019 gestation under oligodendrocyte control; demyelinating attacks reflect autoimmune targeting of myelin basic protein. Neuroanatomically, supracortical lesions lie in the subcortical U-fiber region; optic neuritis implicates the prelaminar optic nerve, often within the orbit. The lesions are oligodendrocyte-mediated, T-cell\u2013driven plaques. The MRI pattern of ovoid, perpendicularly oriented lesions in the supracortical and periventricular white matter reflects the path of medullary veins\u2014a hallmark of MS spectrum pathology.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: The optic nerve and central white matter are insulated by oligodendrocyte-derived myelin, facilitating saltatory conduction. Autoimmune pathophysiology: In CIS, autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells breach the blood\u2013brain barrier, releasing proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) that activate microglia and recruit macrophages. B cells produce antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and myelin basic protein (MBP). Complement activation leads to demyelination and axonal transection. Acute lesions show perivenular cuffing and deposition of immunoglobulin and complement. Over time, incomplete remyelination and gliosis occur. In optic neuritis, this results in conduction block and visual dysfunction. Dissemination in space on MRI reflects multiple sites of blood-brain barrier disruption; dissemination in time requires new immune activation events. Unlike NMOSD, aquaporin-4 antibody\u2013mediated astrocytopathy is absent. In MS, chronic lesions exhibit variable remyelination and neurodegeneration, whereas CIS lesions may resolve or evolve.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CIS most commonly present with optic neuritis (20\u201330%), a single brainstem or cerebellar syndrome (20\u201325%), or spinal cord syndrome (30\u201340%). Optic neuritis features unilateral eye pain exacerbated by movement, decreased visual acuity, dyschromatopsia, and an afferent pupillary defect. In supracortical CIS, patients may have subtle sensory or cognitive findings. MRI lesions are often clinically silent. Approximately 60\u201370% of CIS patients convert to MS over 10 years without treatment; risk factors include baseline MRI lesion load (>2 lesions increases risk to ~75% at 5 years). The 2017 McDonald criteria include both clinical and MRI features; a single clinical attack plus MRI evidence of dissemination in space and time permits an MS diagnosis, but if dissemination in time is not met, the patient remains CIS.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation: Detailed history, neurologic exam, and contrast-enhanced brain and spinal MRI. According to AAN guidelines (2018), brain MRI with identification of \u22652 T2 lesions in disparate regions confirms dissemination in space. CSF analysis for oligoclonal bands increases the likelihood ratio for MS from 3.6 to 10.5. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) may show delayed P100 latency (sensitivity ~70%, specificity ~80%). Second-tier tests: Serum testing for AQP4 and MOG antibodies to exclude NMOSD and MOGAD. OCT may quantify retinal nerve fiber layer thinning. Third-tier: Neurofilament light chain in serum/CSF as a prognostic biomarker under research. Serial MRI at 6\u201312 months assesses dissemination in time; new T2 or gadolinium-enhancing lesions confirm MS diagnosis.","management_principles":"Acute management of optic neuritis in CIS follows the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (1992): IV methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3\u20135 days accelerates recovery but does not affect long-term visual outcome (Class I evidence). Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as interferon-\u03b2 or glatiramer acetate initiated after CIS reduce conversion to MS by ~44% over 2 years (Hazard ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.41\u20130.76; BENEFIT trial, 2011). Fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate also show benefit. Treatment selection is based on risk stratification: high MRI lesion load or presence of oligoclonal bands favors early high-efficacy DMT. Close monitoring for PML with natalizumab and lymphopenia with fingolimod is required.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months with clinical exam and MRI. MRI at 6 months to document new lesions; if new activity appears, escalate to higher-efficacy DMT. Annual visual function testing for optic neuritis. CSF reanalysis is not routinely repeated unless clinical course changes. Long-term monitoring includes liver function tests for interferon therapy, complete blood counts for fingolimod, and JC virus antibody index for natalizumab. Cognitive screening annually to detect subclinical progression. Rehabilitation with low-vision aids and neuro-ophthalmology referrals as needed.","clinical_pearls":"1. CIS is a single demyelinating event: optic neuritis with MRI lesions meets dissemination in space but not time. Recognize CIS to counsel on MS risk and early therapy.\n2. The 2017 McDonald criteria allow earlier MS diagnosis but still require dissemination in time; be wary of overdiagnosing MS on first presentation.\n3. Oligoclonal bands in CSF double the risk of MS conversion; include CSF analysis in CIS workup.\n4. High lesion burden (\u22652 T2 lesions) on baseline MRI increases 5-year conversion risk to ~75%; consider early DMT initiation.\n5. IV steroids speed recovery in optic neuritis but do not change long-term risk of MS; emphasize that treatment is for symptom relief, not disease modification.","references":"1.
