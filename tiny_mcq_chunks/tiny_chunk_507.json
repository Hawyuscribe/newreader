Inferior olive. A PICA infarction disrupting the Guillain\u2013Mollaret triangle leads to hypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olive, producing delayed symptomatic palatal tremor and ocular oscillations manifesting as oscillopsia. Options A and B are incorrect: lesions of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal produce vertical gaze-holding failure but not delayed oscillopsia years after a PICA infarct, and inferior cerebellar peduncle lesions cause ipsilateral ataxia and vestibulocerebellar signs acutely rather than delayed oscillopsia.","conceptual_foundation":"Oscillopsia is the subjective perception of oscillating visual environment due to unstable gaze. The Guillain\u2013Mollaret triangle consists of the dentate nucleus, red nucleus, and inferior olive. A lesion in the central tegmental tract (PICA territory) produces transsynaptic hypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olive months to years later. This phenomenon is classified in ICD-11 under G93.8C (hypertrophic olivary degeneration) and is distinguished from other vestibular and gaze-holding disorders by its delayed onset and palatal tremor association.","pathophysiology":"Normal inferior olive neurons exhibit electrotonic coupling via gap junctions; after interruption of inhibitory GABAergic input from the dentate nucleus via the central tegmental tract, olivary neurons undergo hypertrophy, increased coupling, and rhythmic oscillatory discharge at ~1\u20133 Hz. These oscillations drive the ocular motor nuclei to produce a pendular nystagmus, perceived as oscillopsia. In contrast, interstitial nucleus of Cajal lesions disrupt vertical neural integration without hypertrophic changes, and inferior cerebellar peduncle lesions interrupt afferent vestibulocerebellar fibers acutely without delayed olivary changes.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present months to years after a PICA infarct with rhythmic palatal tremor and low-frequency (1\u20133 Hz) pendular nystagmus causing oscillopsia. The tremor may wax and wane and often correlates with the severity of inferior olivary hypertrophy. There are no significant motor or sensory deficits at this stage. Palatal tremor is seen in ~80% of cases of hypertrophic olivary degeneration.","diagnostic_approach":"Brain MRI shows enlargement and T2 hyperintensity of the inferior olive without contrast enhancement. Video-oculography quantifies pendular nystagmus frequency and amplitude. EMG of palatal muscles confirms rhythmic myoclonus at 1\u20133 Hz. No other investigations are routinely required once the classic triad and imaging findings are present.","management_principles":"Treatment is symptomatic. Benzodiazepines (e.g., clonazepam 0.5\u20132 mg BID) and anticonvulsants (e.g., valproate 250\u2013500 mg TID or gabapentin 300\u2013600 mg TID) may reduce tremor amplitude. Botulinum toxin injections into the tensor veli palatini can alleviate palatal tremor. There is no disease-modifying therapy for inferior olivary hypertrophy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular clinical follow-up every 6\u201312 months to monitor symptom severity and adjust medications. MRI follow-up is not routinely indicated unless new symptoms arise. Functional visual assessments guide rehabilitation for oscillopsia.","clinical_pearls":"1. Delayed onset (months to years) of oscillopsia after brainstem lesion suggests hypertrophic olivary degeneration. 2. Pendular nystagmus at 1\u20133 Hz with palatal tremor is pathognomonic. 3. MRI shows T2 hyperintensity and enlargement of the inferior olive. 4. Treatment is symptomatic with benzodiazepines or anticonvulsants. 5.

What is the most appropriate investigation for this condition?","options":["Dix-Hallpike maneuver"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Dix-Hallpike maneuver","subspecialty":"Neuro-Otology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Dix-Hallpike maneuver. This positional test is the gold\u2010standard bedside investigation for suspected benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the most common cause of brief, rotational vertigo triggered by changes in head position. Numerous clinical studies report that Dix\u2010Hallpike has a sensitivity of approximately 79\u201388% and specificity of 75\u201391% for posterior canal BPPV (Fife et al. 2008; von Brevern et al. 2007). No other bedside maneuver matches its diagnostic yield in eliciting the characteristic paroxysmal upbeating torsional nystagmus. No other listed options are provided; thus, only Dix\u2010Hallpike is available and indicated.","conceptual_foundation":"Rotational vertigo on positional change is pathognomonic for canalithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal\u2014BPPV. In the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD 2015), BPPV is categorized under episodic vestibular syndrome. Otoliths dislodged from the utricle migrate into the posterior canal; head tilt causes endolymph displacement, deflecting the cupula. Key differentials include vestibular migraine, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, and central positional vertigo, but none present with brief (<60s) latency\u2010linked nystagmus on Dix\u2010Hallpike.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, otoconia adhere to the utricular macula. In BPPV, these crystals become free\u2010floating (canalithiasis) within the posterior canal. On Dix\u2010Hallpike, rapid extension and rotation of the head cause otoconial debris to move under gravity, generating an endolymphatic flow that deflects the posterior ampullary cupula. This triggers a transient burst of vestibular afferent firing, producing the characteristic latency followed by torsional upbeating nystagmus lasting under 30 seconds. Central lesions produce nystagmus without latency or fatigue, distinguishing them.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients describe brief episodes (<1 minute) of intense spinning vertigo precipitated by rolling in bed, looking up, or sitting up. Nausea and mild disequilibrium may accompany attacks. There is no auditory symptom, differentiating BPPV from M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease and labyrinthitis. Posterior canal BPPV is the most common variant (~80\u201390% of cases). Lateral canal involvement presents with horizontal nystagmus on the supine roll test rather than Dix\u2010Hallpike findings.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier bedside testing for positional vertigo is the Dix\u2010Hallpike maneuver. The patient is seated with legs extended; the head is turned 45\u00b0 to one side, then rapidly laid back to 20\u00b0\u201330\u00b0 extension. A positive test elicits a delayed (2\u201320 s) torsional upbeating nystagmus lasting <30 s. If negative on both sides, one proceeds to the supine roll test for lateral canal BPPV. No laboratory or imaging studies are required unless atypical features (e.g., direction\u2010changing nystagmus without latency, neurological signs) suggest central pathology, warranting MRI.","management_principles":"Once diagnosed, canalith repositioning maneuvers such as the Epley maneuver for posterior canal BPPV achieve symptom resolution in 80\u201390% of patients after one or two treatments (Fitzgerald and Hall 2014). In refractory cases, Brandt\u2010Daroff habituation exercises can be prescribed. No medications are routinely indicated except short\u2010term vestibular suppressant (e.g., meclizine) for severe nausea. Surgical intervention (posterior canal occlusion) is reserved for extremely refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be reviewed within 1\u20132 weeks after repositioning maneuvers. If symptoms persist, repeat Dix\u2010Hallpike and, if positive, repeat Epley. Recurrence rates are ~15% per year; patients should be educated on self\u2010administered maneuvers. No routine imaging or laboratory follow\u2010up is necessary in typical BPPV without red flags.","clinical_pearls":"1. BPPV vertigo lasts <60 seconds\u2014longer episodes suggest alternative diagnoses. 2. A characteristic latency of 2\u201320 seconds before nystagmus onset is pathognomonic of canalithiasis. 3. Torsional upbeating nystagmus localizes to the posterior canal; horizontal nystagmus on roll test indicates lateral canal involvement. 4. Epley maneuver cures >85% of posterior canal BPPV in one session\u2014teach patients self\u2010repositioning techniques to reduce recurrence. 5. Absence of auditory symptoms and persistent background imbalance distinguishes BPPV from M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease and vestibular neuritis.","references":"1. Fife TD, et al.

Which area is most likely affected?","options":["Tectal midbrain","Cerebellar hemisphere","Pontocerebellar angle","Medulla"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Pontocerebellar angle","subspecialty":"Neuro-Otology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option C (\u201cPontocerebellar angle\u201d) is correct. A lesion at the cerebellopontine (pontocerebellar) angle affecting the vestibular nerve produces a unilateral peripheral vestibular deficit characterized by spontaneous, unidirectional horizontal jerk nystagmus at primary gaze, with a slow drift toward the lesioned side and a fast corrective beat away from it (in this case, to the right). Peripheral nystagmus follows Alexander\u2019s law\u2014intensity increases on gaze toward the fast beat\u2014and is suppressed by visual fixation. \n\nOption A (\u201cTectal midbrain\u201d) is incorrect: midbrain (tectal) lesions classically cause vertical (upbeat or downbeat) or torsional nystagmus rather than pure horizontal jerk nystagmus. Option B (\u201cCerebellar hemisphere\u201d) is incorrect because cerebellar hemisphere lesions produce gaze\u2010evoked nystagmus that manifests on attempted eccentric gaze and is often direction\u2010changing, not a unidirectional primary\u2010gaze nystagmus. Option D (\u201cMedulla\u201d) is incorrect: medullary lesions can cause downbeat nystagmus or ocular bobbing but not an isolated horizontal jerk nystagmus with a fast phase to the right at primary gaze. \n\nThus, the pattern of a slow drift toward the lesion and fast beat away\u2014the characteristic of a peripheral vestibular lesion at the CPA\u2014pinpoints the pontocerebellar angle.","conceptual_foundation":"Nystagmus arises from imbalance in the vestibulo\u2010ocular reflex (VOR) or dysfunction of the gaze\u2010holding neural integrator. Peripheral lesions (labyrinth, vestibular nerve at the CPA) reduce firing on one side, creating a baseline asymmetry: the intact side drives slow drift of the eyes toward the lesioned side, punctuated by fast corrective saccades away. In contrast, central lesions (cerebellar or brainstem) disturb gaze\u2010holding and saccadic pathways, often producing direction\u2010changing horizontal or vertical nystagmus and impaired suppression by fixation. \n\nAnatomically, the vestibular nerve traverses the internal auditory canal to the CPA, where vestibular schwannomas or vascular compression can arise. The flocculus\u2010nodulus complex of the cerebellum provides tonic inhibition to vestibular nuclei; lesions there impair the neural integrator and cause gaze\u2010evoked nystagmus. Midbrain lesions (tectal) compress the vertical gaze centers (riMLF, interstitial nucleus of Cajal), generating vertical or torsional nystagmus. Medullary lesions affect the vestibular nuclei and may cause downbeat or see\u2010saw nystagmus with ocular bobbing patterns.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, bilateral vestibular afferents send head\u2010motion signals to the vestibular nuclei, which via the medial longitudinal fasciculus drive extraocular motoneurons to maintain gaze. A unilateral peripheral lesion (e.g., vestibular nerve compression at the CPA) abolishes input from one side, unopposed contralateral tonic drive causes a slow drift of the eyes toward the lesioned side (slow phase). Central saccadic burst neurons then generate a fast corrective beat toward the intact side. The result is a unidirectional jerk nystagmus with fast phase to the intact side (right in this scenario). \n\nIn cerebellar hemisphere lesions, loss of Purkinje cell inhibition on vestibular nuclei and impaired function of the neural integrator produce a leaky gaze\u2010hold mechanism, manifesting as gaze\u2010evoked nystagmus that changes direction with gaze. Tectal lesions disrupt vertical gaze centers leading to vertical nystagmus, while medullary lesions near the vestibular nuclei can produce downbeat nystagmus by affecting cerebellar\u2010vestibular pathways that normally suppress downward drift.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CPA lesions (vestibular schwannoma, vestibular neuritis) present acutely (neuritis) or subacutely (schwannoma) with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and spontaneous horizontal nystagmus at rest. The nystagmus is unidirectional, with a slow drift toward the lesion and fast corrective beats away; it intensifies when gaze is directed toward the fast phase (Alexander\u2019s law) and is suppressed by visual fixation. Accompanying symptoms may include tinnitus, hearing loss, or facial numbness if adjacent cranial nerves are involved. In contrast, cerebellar lesions cause limb ataxia, dysmetria, and direction\u2010changing gaze\u2010evoked nystagmus, without auditory symptoms. Midbrain and medullary lesions produce vertical or mixed nystagmus patterns and central signs such as dysarthria, weakness, or sensory deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation of acute peripheral vs central vertigo uses the HINTS exam: Head\u2010Impulse test, Nystagmus assessment (unidirectional vs direction\u2010changing), and Test of Skew. A normal head\u2010impulse with direction\u2010changing nystagmus or skew deviation suggests central pathology; an abnormal head\u2010impulse with unidirectional nystagmus suggests peripheral. In CPA lesions, audiometry and MRI with contrast of the internal auditory canals/CPA region confirm vestibular schwannoma. Electronystagmography (ENG) quantifies nystagmus. Central lesions require brain MRI. Vestibular testing (video head impulse test, calorics) further characterizes the deficit. \n\nFirst\u2010tier: HINTS exam and bedside oculomotor testing. Second\u2010tier: MRI brain with and without contrast. Third\u2010tier: ENG/vHIT and audiometry.","management_principles":"Management of acute vestibular neuritis is supportive: short\u2010term vestibular suppressants (meclizine, benzodiazepines), early corticosteroids to hasten recovery, and vestibular rehabilitation. CPA tumors (vestibular schwannomas) are managed based on size and growth: serial observation with periodic MRI for small, asymptomatic lesions; stereotactic radiosurgery or microsurgical resection for growing or symptomatic tumors. Rehabilitation includes balance training and audiologic support. Central causes require targeted therapy (stroke management, demyelination treatment) and neurorehabilitation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Vestibular schwannoma patients require MRI every 6\u201312 months initially, then annually if stable. Audiometric tests monitor hearing. Post\u2010treatment follow\u2010up assesses facial nerve function, balance, and rehabilitation progress. Vestibular neuritis follow\u2010up focuses on compensation, evaluating residual imbalance, and adjusting rehabilitation protocols. Any new or worsening central signs should prompt repeat neuroimaging.","clinical_pearls":"1. Unidirectional horizontal jerk nystagmus at rest suggests a peripheral lesion. 2. Fast phase of peripheral nystagmus beats away from the lesion; fixation suppresses it. 3. HINTS exam (with normal head\u2010impulse, direction\u2010changing nystagmus, skew deviation) has >95% sensitivity for central causes of vertigo. 4.

Brun's nystagmus is characterized by low-frequency, large-amplitude horizontal nystagmus when looking toward the side of the lesion, and high-frequency, small-amplitude nystagmus when looking away from the lesion. The large-amplitude nystagmus is caused by compression of which structure?","options":["Cerebellum","Ipsilateral vestibular system","Midbrain","Pons"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Ipsilateral vestibular system","subspecialty":"Neuro-Otology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. In Brun\u2019s nystagmus, a cerebellopontine angle mass compresses the ipsilateral vestibular system leading to a coarse, low-frequency, large-amplitude nystagmus when the patient looks toward the side of the lesion. Multiple clinical studies and classic neuro-otology texts (K. J. Basser, 1980; AAN Practice Parameter, 2016) confirm that vestibular nerve compression produces a peripheral-type nystagmus component. Option A (Cerebellum) is incorrect because cerebellar lesions cause direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus and limb ataxia rather than the peripheral\u2010type slow component seen in Brun\u2019s nystagmus. Option C (Midbrain) is wrong: midbrain lesions produce upbeat or downbeat central nystagmus patterns. Option D (Pons) is also incorrect: pontine lesions generate central gaze\u2010evoked nystagmus with vertical and horizontal components but not the mixed peripheral\u2010central pattern of Brun\u2019s nystagmus.","conceptual_foundation":"Nystagmus classification divides into peripheral and central types. Peripheral nystagmus arises from lesions of the labyrinth or vestibular nerve (ICD-11: AB51.30) and is characterized by a unidirectional, fatigable slow phase accentuated by head position. Central nystagmus involves brainstem or cerebellar structures (AB51.31) and features non\u2010fatigable, direction\u2010changing components. Brun\u2019s nystagmus is a mixed pattern seen with cerebellopontine angle tumors such as vestibular schwannomas. Embryologically, the vestibular system derives from the otic placode, whereas the pontocerebellar junction arises from rhombomeres 1\u20133. The vestibular nerve travels through the internal auditory canal before entering the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction. Compression here yields the low-frequency component, while central involvement of the flocculus or brainstem pathways yields the high-frequency component when looking away from the lesion.","pathophysiology":"Normal vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilizes gaze during head movements via hair cell transduction in the labyrinth, vestibular nerve transmission, and brainstem nuclei integration. In Brun\u2019s nystagmus, a slow-growing mass compresses the vestibular nerve causing hypofunction on the ipsilateral side. This hypofunction leads to an imbalance in tonic firing rates between the two vestibular nuclei, generating a slow drift of the eyes toward the lesioned side with compensatory fast phases away from the lesion. When gazing away from the lesion, compression of cerebellopontine structures (flocculus\u2010nodulus complex and adjacent brainstem) disrupts central gaze\u2010holding mechanisms, producing a fast, small\u2010amplitude nystagmus. Central involvement differentiates the high\u2010frequency component from pure peripheral nystagmus.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with Brun\u2019s nystagmus often present with unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and visual blurring. They demonstrate two distinct nystagmus patterns: a coarse, low\u2010frequency nystagmus toward the lesion (peripheral component) and a fine, high\u2010frequency nystagmus away from it (central component). The phenomenon appears in 15\u201330% of patients with acoustic neuromas larger than 2.5 cm. Prodromal symptoms may include intermittent disequilibrium and subtle facial numbness due to trigeminal nerve compression. On examination, head impulse testing reveals reduced vestibulo\u2010ocular reflex gain on the affected side. Gait unsteadiness and ataxia may coexist if there is significant cerebellar involvement.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes audiometry, brainstem auditory evoked responses, and high\u2010resolution MRI with gadolinium focusing on the internal auditory canals to visualize cerebellopontine angle masses (sensitivity >95%, specificity >98%). Vestibular function testing (videonystagmography, caloric testing) quantifies asymmetry in vestibular responses. Central involvement is assessed by video\u2010oculography to characterize the high-frequency component. Pre\u2010test probability in patients with unilateral hearing loss and vertigo is approximately 10%; a positive MRI reduces false negatives to <1%. CT is reserved for surgical planning. Differential diagnoses include meningioma, epidermoid, and metastatic lesions.","management_principles":"Management depends on tumor size, patient age, and symptoms. Small tumors (<1.5 cm) with minimal symptoms may be observed with serial MRI every 6\u201312 months (growth >2 mm/year indicates intervention). Stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife) is indicated for tumors up to 3 cm (control rates 85\u201395% at 5 years; Class II evidence). Microsurgical resection via retrosigmoid or translabyrinthine approach achieves gross total resection rates up to 90% with facial nerve preservation in 60\u201380%. Preoperative steroids may reduce peritumoral edema. Vestibular rehabilitation improves post\u2010operative VOR gain and reduces oscillopsia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post\u2010treatment surveillance includes MRI at 6 months, 12 months, then annually for 5 years. Audiometry and facial nerve function assessments occur every 6 months for 2 years. Long\u2010term complications include hydrocephalus (requiring shunt), persistent vestibular hypofunction, and hearing deterioration. Vestibular therapy and hearing rehabilitation (hearing aids or cochlear implants) are tailored based on residual function. Patients require lifelong counseling regarding signs of recurrence (new headaches, brainstem symptoms). Quality\u2010of\u2010life instruments (AAO\u2010HNS Hearing Classification) are used to monitor functional outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Always perform head impulse testing: a positive head\u2010impulse test on the lesioned side confirms peripheral vestibular hypofunction. 3.

Vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas) account for approximately 70\u201380% of CPA tumors and are the classic cause of Brun\u2019s nystagmus due to simultaneous compression of peripheral vestibular nerve fibers and central cerebellar structures. Schwannomas arise from Schwann cells of the vestibular division of cranial nerve VIII and progressively expand within the internal auditory canal and CPA. Aneurysms at the CPA are rare and typically present with subarachnoid hemorrhage rather than Brun\u2019s nystagmus. Arachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic or produce non-specific signs of mass effect and rarely involve the vestibular pathways directly. Meningiomas constitute 10\u201315% of CPA lesions but tend to be broad-based dural and compress adjacent structures more slowly, less commonly producing the dual-phase nystagmus pattern. Therefore, Option A is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Brun\u2019s nystagmus arises when a CPA mass lesion produces peripheral vestibular hypofunction (slow-phase nystagmus toward the lesion) alongside central involvement of cerebellar flocculus and vestibular nuclei (fast-phase nystagmus away from the lesion). Acoustic schwannomas originate from the Schwann cell sheath of CN VIII, most often the vestibular portion, and expand into the CPA, creating a characteristic \u201cice cream cone\u201d MRI appearance. In the WHO classification of central nervous system tumors (WHO 2021), vestibular schwannoma is a grade I benign neoplasm. Differential diagnoses of CPA masses include meningioma (WHO grade I or II), epidermoid cyst, arachnoid cyst, metastatic lesions, and vascular anomalies. Historically, early descriptions of CPA tumors by Cushing and Eisenhardt emphasized surgical approaches and patterns of cranial nerve involvement. Embryologically, Schwann cells derive from neural crest, and their proliferation in the distal nerve root entry zone leads to tumor formation. Anatomically, the internal auditory canal conveys CN VII and VIII alongside the labyrinthine artery; lesions here impact auditory, vestibular, and facial nerve functions. Related conditions include neurofibromatosis type II, where bilateral vestibular schwannomas occur due to NF2 gene mutations on chromosome 22.","pathophysiology":"Normal vestibular function depends on balanced afferent firing from peripheral hair cell\u2013vestibular nerve complex. In a vestibular schwannoma, tumor growth compresses the vestibular nerve, reducing afferent firing from that side, resulting in slow-phase nystagmus toward the lesion (unopposed contralateral vestibular tone). Concurrent compression of the cerebellar flocculus and vestibular nuclei alters central vestibular compensation, producing a fast-phase nystagmus away from the lesion. The dual-phase pattern\u2014Brun\u2019s nystagmus\u2014reflects mixed peripheral and central involvement. Meningiomas may gradually compress adjacent structures but often spare the nerve root entry zone early on, generating less pronounced nystagmus. Arachnoid cysts lack solid tissue to directly compress nerve fibers until large, and aneurysms produce ischemic or hemorrhagic signs rather than sustained vestibular deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Vestibular schwannoma patients typically present between the fourth and sixth decades with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (80\u201395%), tinnitus (60\u201380%), and imbalance (50\u201370%). Brun\u2019s nystagmus is observed on bedside examination: on gaze toward the lesion, coarse slow-phase nystagmus; on gaze away, fine fast-phase nystagmus. Larger tumors (>3 cm) may cause facial numbness (CN V) or weakness (CN VII) and headache from raised intracranial pressure. Meningiomas often present with headache and subtle hearing loss, whereas arachnoid cysts may be asymptomatic or present with slowly progressive symptoms. Aneurysms at the CPA typically manifest with acute headache and cranial neuropathies if they enlarge or rupture.","diagnostic_approach":"In suspected CPA lesion with Brun\u2019s nystagmus, audiometry reveals asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss and speech discrimination deficits. Brain MRI with gadolinium is the gold standard (sensitivity ~100% for lesions >2 mm), showing an enhancing mass in the internal auditory canal and CPA. CT may identify calcified meningiomas. Vestibular testing (caloric irrigation, video head impulse test) demonstrates unilateral hypofunction. MR angiography or CT angiography rules out vascular anomalies. Differential diagnosis includes meningioma (dural tail sign on MRI), epidermoid cyst (restricted diffusion on DWI), and arachnoid cyst (CSF signal, non-enhancing).","management_principles":"Management is guided by tumor size, growth rate, patient age, and symptoms. Options include microsurgical resection (retrosigmoid, translabyrinthine approaches), stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife) for tumors <3 cm, or observation with serial imaging for small, minimally symptomatic lesions. Radiosurgery achieves local control rates >90% at 5 years with preservation of facial nerve function in >95% of cases. Microsurgery offers immediate mass removal but carries risks of hearing loss and facial weakness. Shared decision-making is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"For observation, perform MRI at 6- and 12-month intervals initially, then annually if stable. Audiometry should be repeated annually. After stereotactic radiosurgery, MRI at 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly for at least 5 years. Monitor facial nerve function clinically at each follow-up. Growth exceeding 2 mm/year or new neurologic deficits warrant reconsideration of intervention.","clinical_pearls":"1. Brun\u2019s nystagmus is pathognomonic of CPA mass compressing both peripheral and central vestibular pathways; 2. Vestibular schwannoma is the most common CPA tumor (~70\u201380%); 3. MRI with gadolinium is definitive for diagnosis; 4. Stereotactic radiosurgery is preferred for small tumors in older patients, offering >90% tumor control; 5. Preservation of facial nerve function is a key surgical consideration.","references":"1. Carlson ML, et al. Vestibular schwannoma: natural history and management options.
