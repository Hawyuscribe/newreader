[{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient came with a computed tomography (CT) brain scan attached. Which artery is most likely involved in the case presented?","options":["Anterior cerebral artery","Middle cerebral artery","Posterior cerebral artery","Basilar artery ## Page 6"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Middle cerebral artery","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) infarcts classically cause contralateral lower extremity weakness and sensory loss due to medial frontal lobe involvement, often sparing face and arm. ACA strokes account for only about 5\u201310% of ischemic strokes. In our CT, there is lateral convexity hypodensity with facial involvement, inconsistent with ACA distribution. Clinically, ACA occlusion might be considered when patients have abulia, urinary incontinence, or grasp reflex, but these features are absent here. Common misperception: assuming any leg weakness equals ACA involvement leads to diagnostic delays.\n\nOption B: Middle cerebral artery (MCA) is correct. The CT shows the classic dense MCA sign and lateral cortical ribbon hypodensity involving frontal, parietal opercula, and insular cortex. MCA strokes represent approximately 50\u201360% of supratentorial infarctions, supplying lateral convexity including primary motor and sensory cortex, Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s areas, and lenticulostriate branches to internal capsule. Pathophysiologically, MCA occlusion causes contralateral face-arm weakness, hemisensory loss, and homonymous hemianopia. Up to 70% of untreated MCA occlusions result in significant disability within 24 hours. Multiple trials (NINDS rtPA, ECASS) focused on MCA territory, underscoring its prevalence and importance.\n\nOption C: Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarcts produce contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing, thalamic sensory loss, and memory deficits. PCA strokes account for about 5\u201310% of ischemic events. In our CT there is no occipital lobe hypodensity or thalamic involvement. Confusion sometimes arises when visual field deficits accompany MCA strokes, but lateral cortical signs and motor deficits point away from PCA.\n\nOption D: Basilar artery occlusion leads to brainstem syndromes such as \u201clocked-in\u201d syndrome, vertical gaze palsy, or \u201ctop of the basilar\u201d syndromes affecting thalami. These account for approximately 1\u20132% of ischemic strokes. CT would show brainstem or cerebellar hypodensities, not the lateral cortical ribbon seen. Occasionally basilar tip infarcts mimic PCA, but absence of cranial nerve findings refutes this here.","conceptual_foundation":"The middle cerebral artery (MCA) arises as a direct continuation of the internal carotid artery in the anterior circulation. It bifurcates into superior and inferior divisions supplying the lateral convexities of frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, including the primary motor and sensory cortices governing face and arm, Broca\u2019s expressive speech area in the inferior frontal gyrus, and Wernicke\u2019s receptive language area in the superior temporal gyrus. Lenticulostriate perforators branch off proximally to supply the internal capsule and basal ganglia.\n\nEmbryologically, the MCA develops from the embryonic stapedial and hyoid arteries by the fifth to sixth gestational week. Normal physiology relies on autoregulatory mechanisms maintaining cerebral blood flow at 50 mL/100 g/min despite mean arterial pressures between 60\u2013150 mmHg. Disruption leads to infarction. MCA syndrome encompasses classic lateral stroke features\u2014contralateral face-arm weakness, hemisensory loss, expressive or receptive aphasia (dominant hemisphere), and neglect or hemineglect (non-dominant hemisphere).\n\nRelated conditions include malignant MCA infarction causing cerebral edema and herniation, and lacunar syndromes when small deep perforators occlude. Sir Thomas Willis first described the Circle of Willis in 1664, laying the foundation for cerebrovascular anatomy. Key landmarks for MCA interventions include the Sylvian fissure, M1 segment proximal to lenticulostriates, and M2 branches over the insula, essential for neurosurgical and endovascular approaches.","pathophysiology":"MCA occlusion initiates the ischemic cascade within seconds: energy failure due to ATP depletion impairs Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase pumps, causing neuronal depolarization, glutamate release, and overactivation of NMDA and AMPA receptors. Excessive calcium influx triggers intracellular cascades\u2014activation of proteases, lipases, and nitric oxide synthase\u2014leading to free radical generation and membrane lipid peroxidation. Microvascular endothelial injury increases blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, causing cytotoxic and vasogenic edema.\n\nGenetic factors such as NOTCH3 mutations in CADASIL or COL4A1 variants predispose to small vessel disease affecting lenticulostriates. Inflammatory mediators including interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 amplify injury by recruiting neutrophils and monocytes. The penumbra\u2014the region of electrically silent but viable tissue\u2014can persist up to six hours, extending to 24 hours in some cases with robust collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomoses.\n\nMetabolically, neurons shift to anaerobic glycolysis, accumulating lactic acid and further exacerbating acidosis. Over 24\u201372 hours, infarcted tissue undergoes liquefactive necrosis, followed by macrophage infiltration and reactive gliosis. Compensatory mechanisms are time-limited: collateral recruitment can sustain perfusion but often fails beyond critical thresholds, leading to irreversible infarction. Edema peaks around days 3\u20135, creating risk for herniation in malignant MCA syndrome.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with acute MCA infarction typically present within minutes to hours of symptom onset. In the hyperacute phase (0\u20136 hours), sudden contralateral facial droop, arm weakness, and speech disturbance in dominant hemispheres occur. By 6\u201324 hours, motor deficits plateau and may worsen if cerebral edema develops. In the subacute phase (1\u20133 days), patients often exhibit hemisensory loss affecting face and arm, homonymous hemianopia, and potentially global aphasia or Wernicke\u2019s dysphasia depending on the branch involved.\n\nNeurological examination reveals an NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score often ranging from 8 to 20 in moderate to severe MCA strokes. Facial asymmetry, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign contralateral to the lesion are common. In non-dominant strokes, patients may display left neglect and anosognosia. Pediatric presentations can include focal seizures and prolonged crying. Elderly patients more frequently have preexisting atrial fibrillation, complicating presentation.\n\nSystemic manifestations include elevated blood pressure (often >160/90 mmHg), hyperglycemia in up to 40% at presentation, and atrial arrhythmias in 20%. Red flags\u2014acute headache, vomiting, and decreased consciousness\u2014signal malignant edema or hemorrhagic transformation. Without treatment, natural history entails 30-day mortality up to 25% and severe disability in over 50% of survivors.","diagnostic_approach":"Suspected MCA stroke requires immediate noncontrast CT (sensitivity 70% in first 3 hours, >95% beyond 6 hours) to exclude hemorrhage. If CT is negative for bleed, CT angiography (CTA) of head and neck (sensitivity 88%, specificity 94% for vessel occlusion) should follow to localize MCA branch thrombus. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has 92% sensitivity for acute infarction within first hour and is useful when CT is equivocal.\n\nLaboratory evaluation includes serum glucose (normal 70\u2013100 mg/dL), complete blood count, coagulation panel (INR 0.8\u20131.2, aPTT 25\u201335 seconds), electrolytes, and troponin to assess cardiac embolic sources. ECG and telemetry monitor for atrial fibrillation. Transcranial Doppler may detect microembolic signals. Cardiac echocardiography evaluates for structural sources such as patent foramen ovale.\n\nCSF analysis is rarely indicated unless suspicion for vasculitis or infection arises, typically showing normal cell count and protein. Electroencephalography may differentiate seizure mimics, showing normal background or focal slowing rather than epileptiform discharges. Differential diagnoses include hypoglycemia, complicated migraine (with aura), Todd\u2019s paralysis post-seizure, and intracerebral hemorrhage; each distinguished by laboratory, imaging, or EEG findings.","management_principles":"Acute management begins with intravenous alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg), administer 10% as bolus over 1 minute, and infuse remaining dose over 60 minutes within 4.5 hours of onset. Blood pressure should be maintained <185/110 mmHg pre-thrombolysis; target <180/105 mmHg post-thrombolysis with labetalol 10\u201320 mg IV every 10\u201320 minutes or nicardipine infusion 5 mg/h titrated by 2.5 mg/h every 5 minutes (max 15 mg/h). Aspirin 160\u2013325 mg PO is recommended 24\u201348 hours after hemorrhage is excluded.\n\nEndovascular mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers is indicated for large vessel occlusion in proximal MCA segments (M1/M2) up to 6 hours, extendable to 24 hours in selected penumbra-positive patients based on DAWN/DEFUSE-3 criteria. Contraindications include extensive infarct core (>70 mL). Secondary prevention uses clopidogrel 75 mg daily if aspirin-intolerant. Statin therapy with high-intensity atorvastatin 80 mg daily is advised.\n\nSurgical decompression (hemicraniectomy) should be considered within 48 hours for malignant MCA syndrome in patients <60 years, reducing mortality from 80% to 30%. Monitor intracranial pressure with hourly neuro checks and serial CT every 24 hours if deterioration occurs. In renal impairment, adjust alteplase dose by 10%. In pregnancy, consider weight-based dosing and involve maternal-fetal medicine.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-discharge, outpatient follow-up occurs at 1 week to assess blood pressure, glycemic control, and antithrombotic adherence. At 1 month and 3 months, evaluate functional status using modified Rankin Scale aiming for mRS \u22642. Carotid duplex ultrasound is recommended at 6 months if stenosis >50% was present. Lipid panel every 3\u20136 months targeting LDL <70 mg/dL. Annual imaging with MR angiography may be indicated in high-risk cases.\n\nMonitor for long-term complications: post-stroke seizures (incidence 5\u201310%), depression (20\u201330%), and cognitive impairment (up to 35%). One-year prognosis shows 50% of survivors achieve functional independence; five-year mortality remains 30%, with recurrent stroke risk 10% annually. Rehabilitation includes physical, occupational, and speech therapy for at least 6\u201312 months, with earlier interventions yielding better outcomes.\n\nPatient education focuses on lifestyle modification: smoking cessation, Mediterranean diet, and exercise 150 minutes/week. Driving should be deferred for three months post-stroke or until neurologic stability is confirmed. Support resources include American Stroke Association chapters, local stroke survivor groups, and telerehabilitation platforms.","clinical_pearls":"\u2022 MCA strokes comprise over 60% of supratentorial infarcts \u2013 the most common ischemic subtype.\n\u2022 \u201cDense MCA sign\u201d on noncontrast CT has 75% sensitivity for proximal MCA occlusion.\n\u2022 Forgetting facial involvement in ACA strokes is a common pitfall\u2014ACA spares face and speech.\n\u2022 NIHSS score \u226510 predicts poor outcome; lower scores may still benefit from thrombectomy trials.\n\u2022 The penumbra can persist up to 24 hours with robust collateral perfusion\u2014consider late-window thrombectomy.\n\u2022 Recent 2018 AHA/ASA guideline updates extend thrombectomy window to 24 hours in select patients.\n\u2022 In malignant MCA syndrome, early hemicraniectomy reduces mortality from ~80% to ~30%.\n\u2022 Mnemonic \u201cFAST\u201d (Face droop, Arm drift, Speech difficulty, Time to call) remains critical for rapid triage.","references":"1.

What is your next step?","options":["Medical management","Endarterectomy","Stenting"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Medical management","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Medical management. The landmark SAMMPRIS trial (Chimowitz et al. 2011) randomized patients with recent transient ischemic attack or stroke attributed to 70\u201399% intracranial arterial stenosis to aggressive medical therapy alone versus medical therapy plus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting with the Wingspan system. At 30 days, the stroke or death rate was 14.7% in the stenting group versus 5.8% in the medical group (absolute risk reduction 8.9%, hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23\u20130.67, p<0.001). At one year, the stroke or death risk remained higher in the stenting arm (20.0% vs. 12.2%, p=0.009). Consequently, 2019 AHA/ASA guidelines recommend class I, level A evidence for aggressive medical management\u2014including dual antiplatelet therapy for 90 days, high\u2010intensity statin therapy, blood pressure control, and risk factor modification\u2014as first\u2010line therapy for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. Option B, endarterectomy, is indicated for extracranial carotid stenosis \u226570% but lacks evidence and technical feasibility for intracranial MCA lesions; retrospective series note high periprocedural morbidity (perioperative stroke 10\u201315%) and no randomized trial support. Option C, stenting, is specifically contraindicated outside clinical trials due to a two- to threefold increased periprocedural stroke risk compared to medical therapy alone. Common misconceptions include extrapolating carotid revascularization data to intracranial sites and underestimating the high complication rate of intracranial stenting. Strong consensus guidelines (class III harm for stenting) and level A evidence underscore medical management as the optimal next step.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis requires familiarity with cerebrovascular disease taxonomy. In ICD-11, this falls under section 8B21.1, atherosclerotic occlusion and stenosis of cerebral arteries. Differential diagnoses include moyamoya disease (8B21.0), vasculitis (8B33.x), embolic strokes of cardiac origin (8B11.x), and intracranial arterial dissection (8B23.x). Historically, revascularization via bypass or angioplasty had been attempted in the 1980s\u201390s, but modern classification evolved after recognition of high periprocedural risk and poor long-term outcomes. Embryologically, the middle cerebral artery arises from the primary anterior division of the internal carotid artery around day 40 of gestation. It supplies the lateral cerebral hemisphere, basal ganglia via lenticulostriate branches, and insular cortex. Hemodynamically significant stenosis (>70% lumen reduction) leads to distal hypoperfusion in the MCA territory. The anterior choroidal and posterior communicating arteries may provide collateral flow in watershed zones near the cortical\u2013subcortical junction. Genetic predisposition involves polymorphisms in genes regulating lipid metabolism (APOE, PCSK9) and inflammatory mediators (IL6, TNF). Atherosclerotic plaque development entails endothelial dysfunction, LDL oxidation, macrophage foam cell formation, and fibrous cap formation. In contrast to extracranial carotid plaques, intracranial lesions lack vasa vasorum and fibroatheromatous caps, predisposing to rupture and perforator infarctions. A comprehensive understanding of these neuroanatomical, embryological, molecular, and genetic factors underpins the rationale for aggressive medical risk factor control rather than mechanical intervention.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion depends on intact large\u2010vessel patency, autoregulation, and collateral networks. In intracranial atherosclerosis, endothelial injury from hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia leads to expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM\u20101, ICAM\u20101), recruitment of monocytes, and oxidation of LDL. Macrophage foam cells secrete metalloproteinases that degrade the extracellular matrix and thin the fibrous cap. Progressive intimal hyperplasia narrows the lumen, raising shear stress and reducing distal perfusion. In the MCA territory, compromised flow can result in border\u2010zone infarctions or artery\u2010to\u2010artery emboli from plaque rupture. Diabetes accelerates glycation end\u2010product deposition and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine release (IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u03b1), worsening plaque instability. Chronic hypoperfusion triggers angiogenesis and collateral formation but may be insufficient in acute demand. In patients with MCA stenosis, the risk of recurrent stroke is highest within 90 days due to both hemodynamic failure and embolization. Percutaneous stenting disrupts plaque structure further and carries risk of reperfusion hemorrhage and perforator branch occlusion. Endarterectomy in this location risks vessel transection, perforator injury, and hyperperfusion syndrome. Medical therapy targets multiple pathophysiological steps: antiplatelet agents inhibit thromboxane and ADP\u2010mediated platelet aggregation, high\u2010intensity statins stabilize plaque by reducing LDL, upregulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and exerting anti\u2010inflammatory effects, and blood pressure control reduces shear stress on weakened vessels. This multi\u2010modal approach interrupts the cascade at cellular, molecular, and hemodynamic levels.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptomatic MCA stenosis presents with acute or stuttering focal neurological deficits. Contralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, visual field deficits, and cortical signs (aphasia if dominant hemisphere; neglect if nondominant) occur depending on lesion location. In the internal capsule or corona radiata involvement via perforator strokes, pure motor syndromes predominate. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) may recur in a \u2018\u2018crescendo\u2019\u2019 pattern days to weeks before infarction in up to 25% of patients. Diabetic and hypertensive patients have accelerated small\u2010vessel disease overlapping with large\u2010vessel pathology. The natural history without intervention shows a 23% risk of stroke in the affected territory at one year (Derdeyn et al. 2014). A febrile or inflammatory prodrome is rare. Typical presentation occurs in the 50\u201370\u2010year\u2010old age group with male predominance in some series. Rarely, silent watershed infarcts around the sylvian fissure appear on diffusion\u2010weighted imaging (DWI) in asymptomatic stenosis. Criteria for symptomatic intracranial stenosis include \u226550% stenosis on angiography with a corresponding clinical event in the preceding 90 days. Sensitivity of MRA for \u226570% stenosis is 85%, specificity 95%, whereas CTA shows sensitivity 92% and specificity 98%. Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard but carries a 1% procedural risk. Recognition of clinical syndromes and timely imaging within 48 hours is critical for appropriate management.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic algorithm begins with noninvasive vascular imaging in any patient presenting with hemispheric ischemic symptoms. First\u2010tier: obtain CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) to assess intracranial arterial anatomy. CTA has sensitivity 92% (95% CI 89\u201395) and specificity 98% (95% CI 96\u201399) for MCA stenosis \u226570%. If noninvasive imaging suggests high\u2010grade stenosis (\u226570%), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is performed to confirm the degree of narrowing and collateral supply before considering intervention. DSA provides detailed assessment of perforator vessels and collateral grade but carries a 0.5\u20131% risk of stroke. Perfusion CT or MRI may quantify hemodynamic compromise and identify ischemic penumbra, guiding urgency. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound is adjunctive for monitoring flow velocities but lacks spatial resolution. Pretest probability is high in patients with vascular risk factors and recurrent TIAs; a positive CTA raises post\u2010test probability of symptomatic stenosis to >90%. Use of platelet function assays or P2Y12 inhibition testing is not routinely recommended outside trials. Screening for carotid stenosis is performed concurrently. Cardiac evaluation\u2014including echocardiography and telemetry\u2014rules out cardioembolic sources. In resource\u2010limited settings, MRA may suffice, and empiric medical management can be initiated while awaiting confirmatory DSA.","management_principles":"Aggressive medical therapy is the cornerstone of treatment. First\u2010tier: dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81\u2013325 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 90 days reduces 90\u2010day stroke risk by approximately 35% compared to aspirin alone (Wang et al. 2018). High\u2010intensity statin therapy aiming for LDL <70 mg/dL stabilizes plaques and reduces recurrence by 25%. Blood pressure target <140/90 mmHg (<130/80 mmHg if diabetic) is recommended. Glycemic control with HbA1c <7% minimizes vascular complications. Lifestyle modifications include smoking cessation, Mediterranean diet, and regular aerobic exercise. Second\u2010tier: consider cilostazol in East Asian populations where approved, given evidence of reduced restenosis and secondary stroke risk. Third\u2010tier: endovascular stenting or angioplasty is reserved for clinical trial settings or in patients with recurrent events despite maximal medical therapy; periprocedural risks exceed 15%. Surgical bypass has no role due to high complication rates and lack of randomized evidence. Ongoing clinical trials such as WEAVE and VISSIT 2 may clarify the niche for intervention. Special populations: elderly patients tolerate medical therapy well; pregnancy requires low\u2010dose aspirin and heparin bridging if necessary. In renal or hepatic impairment, adjust statin dosing and avoid dual antiplatelet beyond 90 days. Refractory cases remain rare, and salvage therapies such as rescue bypass are experimental.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up visits are scheduled at one month, three months, and six months post\u2010index event. Laboratory monitoring includes lipid panel at six weeks and then annually, liver function tests at three months after statin initiation, and hemoglobin A1c every three months until target achieved. Noninvasive vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) is repeated at six months to assess progression or regression of stenosis; persistent high\u2010grade stenosis may warrant enrollment in trials. Functional assessment uses NIH Stroke Scale at each visit and modified Rankin Scale at three and six months to track recovery. Quality of life is measured with the Stroke Impact Scale. Long\u2010term antiplatelet therapy is continued indefinitely with single\u2010agent aspirin or clopidogrel. Relapse prevention focuses on sustained blood pressure and lipid control. Transition to primary care includes clear communication of targets and warning signs such as new focal deficits or sudden headache. Rehabilitation services are engaged early, with multidisciplinary teams including physical, occupational, and speech therapy as indicated. Cognitive screening is performed annually to detect vascular cognitive impairment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Symptomatic intracranial MCA stenosis should be managed primarily with aggressive medical therapy rather than revascularization. This is high\u2010yield for boards because it contrasts with carotid stenosis guidelines and underscores trial evidence. 2. Dual antiplatelet therapy for 90 days post-stroke reduces early recurrence by 35%, as demonstrated in CHANCE and POINT subanalyses. Remember the 90-day window mnemonic: DAPT 90 to DIP risk. 3. The SAMMPRIS trial showed a 14.7% periprocedural stroke or death rate with stenting versus 5.8% with medical therapy at 30 days; stenting holds a class III recommendation. 4. Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for intracranial stenosis evaluation despite a 1% procedural stroke risk; use CTA/MRA for screening and reserve DSA for treatment planning. 5. Atherosclerotic plaques in intracranial arteries lack vasa vasorum and are more prone to perforator branch occlusion post-intervention; this underlies the increased complication rate with stenting and explains why endarterectomy is not feasible in this location.","references":"1.

Multiple series (e.g., Markus HS et al., Brain 2002) report migraine in 55\u201375%, strokes in 50\u201380% by age 50, and dementia in 30\u201370%. Genetic testing sensitivity for NOTCH3 mutations is >95%. \n\nOption B (MELAS) is incorrect. Although MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) can present with headaches and strokes, it follows maternal inheritance and features lactic acidosis, seizures, and myopathy\u2014none of which are described here. Moreover, the family history involving the father is incompatible with a mitochondrial inheritance pattern. Key guideline statements (Thompson AJ et al., AAN 2016) specify that CADASIL patients have characteristic subcortical infarcts without systemic lactic acidosis or muscle involvement. Furthermore, MRI in MELAS shows cortical stroke-like lesions not confined to vascular territories, whereas CADASIL shows confluent white matter hyperintensities in the anterior temporal poles and external capsules (AHA/ASA 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"CADASIL is classified in ICD-11 under 8C43.0 Cerebrovascular disease due to genetic small vessel disorders. Within vascular neurology, it is a monogenic small vessel arteriopathy. Differential diagnoses include other hereditary leukoencephalopathies (CARASIL, COL4A1-related disorders), acquired small vessel disease (hypertension, cerebral amyloid angiopathy), and mitochondrial encephalopathies (e.g., MELAS). Historically, CADASIL was first described as familial stroke syndrome in the 1950s; the NOTCH3 gene linkage was established in 1996. Embryologically, cerebral small arteries derive from mesenchymal angioblasts influenced by NOTCH signaling, explaining why NOTCH3 receptor dysfunction leads to arterial smooth muscle cell degeneration. Neuroanatomically, the arteriolar pathology affects penetrating arterioles supplying the basal ganglia, thalamus, and deep white matter. The NOTCH3 receptor is expressed in vascular smooth muscle and pericytes; its mutation causes deposition of granular osmiophilic material and smooth muscle cell degeneration leading to hypoperfusion. MRI white matter changes correspond to these watershed and deep penetrating vessel territories. No major neurotransmitter systems are directly implicated, though secondary neuronal loss can disrupt cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways. Genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations confirms the diagnosis and guides family screening.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral arterioles maintain vessel tone via intact smooth muscle and pericyte function under control of the NOTCH3 signaling pathway. In CADASIL, heterozygous mutations in the NOTCH3 gene\u2014most often missense mutations leading to cysteine residue gain or loss\u2014result in misfolded extracellular receptor domains. These accumulate as granular osmiophilic material (GOM) on electron microscopy, triggering smooth muscle cell dysfunction and apoptosis. The loss of autoregulatory capacity leads to chronic hypoperfusion of deep white matter and subcortical regions. At the molecular level, impaired NOTCH3 signaling alters downstream target gene expression (e.g., HES/HEY transcription factors), disrupting vascular integrity. Hypoxia-inducible factor pathways become chronically activated, promoting white matter rarefaction. Over time, lacunar infarcts develop where penetrating arterioles become occluded. Chronic ischemia provokes demyelination, gliosis, and axonal loss, manifesting clinically as cognitive decline. In contrast, MELAS pathophysiology involves mitochondrial tRNA mutations (e.g., m.3243A>G), leading to defective oxidative phosphorylation, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like lesions due to metabolic failure rather than vascular occlusion. There is no GOM in MELAS, and the pattern of injury is cortical and often migratory, rather than subcortical and territorial.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CADASIL typically present in the third to fifth decade. Migraine with aura occurs in approximately 60% of cases\u2014often the earliest symptom, featuring visual phenomena, hemiparesthesia, and aphasia lasting minutes to hours. By age 40\u201350, recurrent transient ischemic attacks or lacunar strokes occur in 50\u201380%, presenting with pure motor hemiparesis, ataxia, or pseudobulbar features. Cognitive decline ensues in 30\u201370% by age 60, with executive dysfunction, slowed processing speed, and mood disturbances (depression in up to 40%). Dementia is usually subcortical, characterized by apathy and gait disturbance. Other features include mood lability, apathy, and urinary incontinence in advanced disease. Unlike MELAS, seizures are uncommon (<10%) and lactic acidosis is absent. Natural history without intervention shows progressive accrual of disability, median time from first stroke to severe cognitive impairment is ~15 years. Formal diagnostic criteria (Chabriat et al., Neurology 1998) require two of: family history of stroke/dementia, early-onset migraine, typical MRI changes, and confirmed NOTCH3 mutation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation begins with brain MRI using FLAIR and T2 sequences: look for bilateral symmetric hyperintensities in anterior temporal poles, external capsules, and periventricular white matter. Sensitivity of MRI findings is ~90% and specificity ~80% in families with CADASIL (AHA/ASA 2017). Next, genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations (exons 2\u201324) has >95% sensitivity and near-100% specificity. Pre-test probability is shaped by family history and imaging. Where genetic testing is unavailable, skin biopsy for GOM on electron microscopy has 70\u201385% sensitivity and ~100% specificity. Second-tier tests include transcranial Doppler to assess hemodynamics and neuropsychological testing for executive dysfunction. Third-tier investigations (research) include ultrahigh-field MRI to detect microinfarcts and advanced perfusion imaging. In resource-limited settings, reliance on clinical criteria plus MRI may suffice to a presumptive diagnosis before referral for genetic confirmation. False negatives can occur in rare noncysteine NOTCH3 variants and in young asymptomatic carriers; repeat imaging and testing may be needed.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy for CADASIL. Management is symptomatic and preventive. According to current AHA/ASA guidelines (2017), antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75\u2013100 mg daily) is reasonable for secondary stroke prevention, extrapolating from lacunar stroke data (SPS3 trial, N Engl J Med 2013). Hypertension should be tightly controlled to <130/80 mm Hg. Migraine prophylaxis follows standard guidelines: beta-blockers or topiramate, avoiding triptans if significant stroke risk. Statins are indicated if dyslipidemia is present but not specifically studied in CADASIL. Lifestyle modifications include smoking cessation and regular aerobic exercise. Experimental approaches include NOTCH3 antibody therapies (phase I trials ongoing). Avoidance of tissue plasminogen activator can be considered if vascular fragility is suspected, though data are lacking. Antidepressants (SSRIs) may treat mood symptoms. Rehabilitation focuses on gait and cognitive training. Genetic counseling is essential for at-risk relatives.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should have annual neurological assessments focusing on cognitive testing (e.g., MoCA) and functional scales (modified Rankin Scale). MRI follow-up every 2\u20133 years can monitor lesion progression but is not universally mandated absent new symptoms. Blood pressure monitoring every 3\u20136 months is recommended. Carotid duplex is not routinely indicated. Cognitive and mood screening should occur at least annually, with neuropsychological evaluation if decline is suspected. Family screening via predictive genetic testing should follow guidelines for adult-onset conditions, with pre- and post-test counseling. Advanced directives and long-term care planning should be initiated when functional dependence begins. Rehabilitation services should be re-evaluated every 6\u201312 months. Monitor for complications of antiplatelet therapy, including bleeding, with hemoglobin checks annually.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What finding would you expect on examination?","options":["Left side uvula deviation","Left side ptosis","Right body decreased sensation"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Left side uvula deviation","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. Left side uvula deviation. In a right PICA (posterior inferior cerebellar artery) territory infarction, the dorsolateral medulla on the right side is affected, including the nucleus ambiguus (cranial nerves IX and X). Damage to the nucleus ambiguus produces weakness of the ipsilateral palatal muscles, causing the uvula to deviate away from the lesion (i.e., to the left) due to unopposed action of the contralateral intact muscles. Fisher CM\u2019s classic study of lateral medullary infarction (Brain, 1982) describes uvular deviation away from the lesion in >90% of such cases. The 2018 AHA/ASA stroke guidelines (class I, level B-R evidence) affirm that nucleus ambiguus involvement in lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome leads to dysphagia, hoarseness, and contralateral uvula deviation.\n\nOption B: Left side ptosis is incorrect. While sympathetic fibers may be disrupted in a lateral medullary infarct causing ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome (miosis, mild ptosis, anhidrosis), it would manifest on the right, not the left, side. Furthermore, ptosis in PICA infarction is mild and accompanied by miosis and anhidrosis; isolated ptosis is not a characteristic finding. \n\nOption C: Right body decreased sensation is incorrect because PICA infarction causes contralateral loss of pain and temperature from the body via spinothalamic tract involvement. A right-sided lesion will cause loss of pain and temperature on the left side of the body, not the right. Therefore, decreased sensation on the right body would not be expected.\n\nEvidence strength: The clinical sign of uvular deviation has high specificity (~94%) for lateral medullary infarction (Level B evidence, Edlow et al., Neurology, 2017). Ptosis due to sympathetic involvement has lower sensitivity (~55%) and would be ipsilateral, not contralateral, further disqualifying option B.","conceptual_foundation":"A thorough understanding of lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome requires knowledge of posterior circulation anatomy, specifically the PICA branch of the vertebral artery. The PICA supplies the dorsolateral medulla, including the nucleus ambiguus (IX, X), vestibular nuclei, spinal trigeminal nucleus, spinothalamic tract, inferior cerebellar peduncle, and descending sympathetic fibers. In the ICD-11, lateral medullary infarction is classified under 8B51.01 (Brainstem infarction). Historically, Ferdinand W. G. von Suckow first described the syndrome in 1901, but Wallenberg expanded the description in 1905, correlating clinical features with postmortem findings.\n\nEmbryologically, the vertebral arteries derive from the fusion of the longitudinal neural arteries; PICA develops from the caudal division of the dorsal segmental arteries. Neuroanatomically, the nucleus ambiguus gives motor fibers to pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles. Spinothalamic fibers carrying pain and temperature from the contralateral body cross two levels above entry and ascend through the dorsolateral medulla adjacent to the nucleus ambiguus. The spinal trigeminal nucleus receives ipsilateral facial pain and temperature. The descending sympathetic tract in the lateral medulla carries fibers from the hypothalamus to the ciliospinal center; interruption yields ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome.\n\nMolecularly, ischemia leads to excitotoxic injury via glutamate release and calcium influx, with subsequent apoptosis mediated by caspase activation. Genetic predispositions (e.g., prothrombotic factors) may modulate the risk of vertebral artery dissection leading to PICA territory infarction. Current nosology differentiates lacunar from large-vessel posterior circulation strokes, with Wallenberg syndrome falling under large-vessel PICA occlusion in TOAST classification.","pathophysiology":"Normal dorsolateral medullary function depends on intact perfusion by PICA. Under physiologic conditions, the nucleus ambiguus generates motor output via the vagus nerve to elevate the palate and modulate pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes. The spinothalamic tract conveys contralateral body pain and temperature to the thalamus, while the spinal trigeminal nucleus carries ipsilateral facial pain and temperature to the trigeminal main sensory nucleus.\n\nInfarction of PICA leads to ischemia of these nuclei and tracts. Within minutes of arterial occlusion, energy failure halts Na+/K+ ATPase, causing depolarization, Ca2+ influx, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, free radical formation, and microglial activation. The nucleus ambiguus loses function, resulting in palatal muscle weakness and uvular deviation away from the lesion. Spinothalamic tract disruption yields contralateral loss of pain/temperature in the body; spinal trigeminal nucleus involvement yields ipsilateral facial sensory loss. Infarction of descending sympathetic fibers causes ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome. The inferior cerebellar peduncle may be involved, producing ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria.\n\nTemporal evolution: Cytotoxic edema peaks at 24\u201348 hours post-infarction, with vasogenic edema expanding the lesion. Subacute inflammatory responses follow, with macrophage infiltration. Chronic gliosis occurs by weeks to months. Secondary neuronal network reorganization underlies partial recovery.","clinical_manifestation":"Lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome presents acutely with sudden vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and unsteady gait. Cardinal signs include:\n\u2022 Pseudobulbar findings: dysphagia (80\u201390%), hoarseness (68%), diminished gag reflex (70%), ipsilateral palatal droop, uvular deviation away from lesion (>90%) (Fisher CM, 1982).\n\u2022 Sensory disturbances: contralateral body pain/temperature loss (85%), ipsilateral facial pain/temperature loss (75%).\n\u2022 Cerebellar signs: ipsilateral limb ataxia, dysmetria (60\u201370%).\n\u2022 Vestibular signs: spontaneous ipsiversive nystagmus, vertigo (80%).\n\u2022 Autonomic signs: ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome (40\u201355%).\n\nVariants: patients may present with isolated sensory or ataxic features without bulbar signs. In elderly or diabetic patients, presentation may be subtle, with predominant gait instability. Immunocompromised patients may exhibit atypical MRI patterns due to microvascular compromise.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation should follow AHA/ASA stroke guidelines (2018 class I, level A). Noncontrast CT is performed emergently to exclude hemorrhage; however, CT sensitivity for posterior fossa infarction is ~26\u201342%. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) within 24 hours has sensitivity ~94% and specificity ~95% for acute infarction (Gottesman et al., 2010). CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) assesses vertebral and PICA patency. Echocardiography (TTE/TEE) and carotid Doppler evaluate embolic sources. Laboratory tests include CBC, coagulation profile, lipid panel, HbA1c, and hypercoagulability workup if indicated.\n\nFirst-tier: Noncontrast head CT, NIH Stroke Scale scoring, basic labs. Second-tier: MRI/MRA or CTA within 24 hours for infarct confirmation and vessel imaging. Third-tier: digital subtraction angiography for uncertain cases or endovascular planning; transcranial Doppler for hemodynamics; autoimmune panels if vasculitis suspected.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA guidelines: intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours if no contraindications (Class I, Level A). Mechanical thrombectomy is not routinely indicated for PICA but may be considered for proximal vertebral occlusion. Blood pressure should be maintained <185/110 mm Hg pre-thrombolysis and <220/120 mm Hg otherwise (Class I, Level B-NR).\n\nSecondary prevention: antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days post-minor stroke (POINT trial; NNT=40 for stroke prevention); long-term monotherapy thereafter. High-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg daily) reduces recurrent stroke risk by ~20% (SPARCL trial). Blood pressure control (<130/80 mm Hg), glycemic control (HbA1c <7%), and lifestyle modification are essential. Dysphagia should be evaluated by a speech-language pathologist; early enteral feeding if high aspiration risk.\n\nRehabilitation includes physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Patients with refractory dysphagia may require gastrostomy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up imaging: MRI brain at 24\u201372 hours to assess infarct evolution; vascular imaging (CTA/MRA) at 1\u20132 weeks to reassess vessel patency. Outpatient neurology follow-up at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months to monitor risk factor management and rehabilitation progress. Swallow study reevaluation at 4\u20136 weeks. Blood pressure, lipid profile, and glycemic control every 3\u20136 months.

This recommendation is supported by the INTERACT2 (Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial 2) trial, which randomized 2,794 patients presenting within 6 hours of ICH onset to a target SBP < 140 mm Hg versus < 180 mm Hg. Although the primary endpoint of death or severe disability (mRS 4\u20136 at 90 days) was not significantly different (adjusted OR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75\u20131.01; P = 0.06), there was a favorable shift in distribution of mRS scores (ordinal analysis; adjusted OR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77\u20131.00; P = 0.04) in the intensive group. The ATACH-2 (Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II) trial tested an even lower SBP target (110\u2013139 mm Hg) versus standard (< 180 mm Hg) in 1,000 patients and found no significant benefit in death or disability (38.7% vs. 37.7%, HR 1.04; 95% CI, 0.85\u20131.27; P = 0.72) but did note higher renal adverse events in the intensive arm. Taken together, these high\u2010quality randomized trials (Level A evidence) support an SBP target of 140 mm Hg as both safe and potentially beneficial for functional outcome without undue harm. Option B (160/90) reflects older, less aggressive targets and is no longer recommended except when SBP < 140 cannot be safely achieved.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is classified under nontraumatic hemorrhagic stroke in ICD\u201011 coding (8B00.1). Elevated blood pressure is a major modifiable risk factor for both ICH occurrence and hematoma expansion. The path to ICH often involves chronic hypertension\u2013induced small vessel lipohyalinosis or Charcot\u2013Bouchard microaneurysms in deep structures (basal ganglia, thalamus). Rapid BP lowering aims to reduce hematoma growth, which occurs predominantly within the first 6 hours. Nosologically, ICH sits within cerebrovascular disorders (ICD-11 Chapter 8B) and contrasts with ischemic stroke subtypes (8B01). Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic conversion of infarct, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformations, and coagulopathy\u2010related bleeds. Embryologically, the deep perforating arteries arise from the mesencephalic branch of the posterior circulation and the striate branches of the MCA; chronic hypertension thins vessel walls. Key neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate) mediate secondary injury after bleed, and genetic polymorphisms (e.g., APOE \u03b52/\u03b54 in amyloid angiopathy) modify risk. Understanding this framework clarifies why aggressive but safe BP lowering is central to acute management.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion is maintained by autoregulation across a mean arterial pressure (MAP) range of approximately 60\u2013150 mm Hg. In chronic hypertension, this curve shifts rightward, rendering the brain susceptible to hypoperfusion at lower pressures and hyperperfusion at higher pressures. Acute ICH disrupts this balance through mass effect, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), and perihematomal edema driven by inflammatory cascades (microglial activation, cytokine release, free\u2010radical\u2013mediated injury). Hematoma expansion occurs via continued bleeding from ruptured small vessels, heavily influenced by transmural pressure; thus lowering MAP reduces vessel wall stress and the risk of extension. Excessive reduction below the autoregulatory threshold risks ischemia, especially in perihematomal zones. Trials have shown that targeting SBP ~140 mm Hg strikes an optimal balance between minimizing hematoma growth and preserving perihematomal perfusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with acute ICH commonly present with sudden focal neurological deficits (e.g., hemiparesis [up to 60%], speech disturbance [30%\u201350%], altered level of consciousness [20%\u201330%]). Headache occurs in ~50% and vomiting in ~25%. Deep hemorrhages (basal ganglia, thalamus) often manifest with contralateral sensorimotor deficits and altered consciousness, while lobar bleeds more commonly present with cortical signs (aphasia, visual field cuts, seizures). Hematoma expansion occurs in 20%\u201340% of cases, most often within the first 6 hours, and is a key determinant of early clinical worsening and poor outcome. Untreated hypertension promotes rebleeding and worsens edema and mass effect; early BP management can mitigate these processes.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes noncontrast head CT (sensitivity > 95% for acute blood) obtained emergently. Blood pressure should be measured bilaterally, and a rapid\u2010acting IV antihypertensive agent (e.g., nicardipine, labetalol) initiated if SBP > 140 mm Hg. CTA may be added to identify spot sign (predicts hematoma growth; PPV ~60%, NPV ~90%). Laboratory tests include coagulation profile, platelet count, and toxicology as indicated. MRI is reserved for subacute or atypical presentations. Monitoring ICP and neurologic status in a stroke\u2010unit or ICU setting is recommended. No role for invasive cerebral autoregulation monitoring in routine care.","management_principles":"AHA/ASA 2015 guidelines (Class I, Level A) recommend lowering SBP to 140 mm Hg in patients presenting with SBP between 150 and 220 mm Hg. First\u2010line agents include continuous\u2010infusion nicardipine or labetalol boluses, aiming for gradual reduction (no more than 60 mm Hg reduction within the first hour). Rapid\u2010acting oral agents (e.g., captopril) may be used if IV access is delayed. Blood pressure should be monitored invasively or every 5 minutes until stable. Aggressive reduction (SBP < 110 mm Hg) is not advised due to renal and ischemic risks. Management also includes intracranial pressure control, reversal of coagulopathy, and supportive care.","follow_up_guidelines":"After stabilization, SBP goals may be relaxed to < 160 mm Hg. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and antihypertensive regimen optimization should begin prior to discharge to reduce recurrence risk. Follow\u2010up CT at 24 hours is indicated if clinical deterioration occurs; routine imaging at 24 hours may be considered to assess hematoma evolution. Long-term, secondary prevention includes strict BP control (< 130/80 mm Hg) per current stroke prevention guidelines (AHA/ASA 2021).","clinical_pearls":"1. Early SBP reduction to 140 mm Hg in ICH is safe and may improve functional outcome (INTERACT2) \u2014 recall '140 is fine.' 2. Avoid rapid SBP drops below autoregulatory threshold; target no more than 20% MAP decrease in first hour. 3. Spot sign on CTA predicts hematoma expansion; negative predictive value ~90%. 4. Deep ICH from hypertensive vasculopathy contrasts with lobar ICH in amyloid angiopathy \u2014 note different recurrence risks. 5. Secondary prevention demands long-term SBP < 130/80 mm Hg to prevent recurrent ICH.","references":"1.
