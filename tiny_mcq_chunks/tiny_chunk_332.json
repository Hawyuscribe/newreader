CRPS is characterized by disproportionate pain, erythema, swelling, and autonomic changes in a limb following trauma, most commonly a distal radius fracture. Harden et al\u2019s Budapest clinical diagnostic criteria (2010) require continuing pain disproportionate to any inciting event plus at least one sign in two of four categories (sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, motor/trophic). In prospective cohorts, applying Budapest criteria yields sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.68 (Harden et al. PAIN 2010;150(2):268\u2013274). Option B (arterial insufficiency) typically presents with pallor, pulselessness, and cool extremity, not erythema or warmth. Option C (Dejerine\u2013Roussy syndrome) is thalamic pain syndrome after a thalamic stroke, with contralateral hemianesthesia and intractable central pain developing weeks after a cerebral infarct, not after peripheral fracture. Option D is not provided, but any other peripheral neuropathy would not produce the hallmark autonomic signs seen here. Common pitfalls include misattributing swelling and pain to infection or deep venous thrombosis, whereas CRPS often shows warm, red limb and hyperalgesia without systemic infection markers. Thus, A is supported by clinical diagnostic criteria, epidemiological data showing up to 7% of distal radius fractures evolve into CRPS (Marinus et al. Neurology 2011;76(12):1100\u20131108), and guideline recommendations (IASP, EFNS).","conceptual_foundation":"CRPS is a neuropathic pain disorder with autonomic dysregulation following trauma. There are two subtypes: Type I (without confirmed nerve injury) and Type II (with nerve injury). In ICD-11, CRPS is coded under ME89.2\u2014Complex regional pain syndrome. Differential diagnosis includes deep vein thrombosis (cold, cyanotic limb), infection (fever, warmth with systemic signs), peripheral arterial disease (cold, pale limb), and neuropathies (sensory loss rather than hyperalgesia). Historically, S. Weir Mitchell first described causalgia in Civil War soldiers with gunshot injuries to peripheral nerves; the term CRPS evolved in the 1990s to reflect both sympathetically maintained and sympathetically independent pain. Embryologically, peripheral sympathetic fibers derive from neural crest cells, and their dysregulation in CRPS leads to vasomotor disturbances. Neuroanatomically, the condition involves afferent small-fiber (A\u03b4 and C) sensitization, efferent sympathetic outflow causing vasodilation or vasoconstriction, and central sensitization in dorsal horn neurons and cortical reorganization in somatosensory cortex. Neurotransmitters implicated include substance P, calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide, noradrenaline, and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6). Genetic predispositions (e.g., HLA\u2010B62, HLA\u2010DQ8) have been reported but lack definitive predictive value. Understanding CRPS therefore requires integration of neurology, immunology, and pain medicine principles.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, noxious stimuli activate peripheral nociceptors, transmitting signals via A\u03b4 and C fibers to the dorsal horn, then ascending via spinothalamic tracts. Sympathetic efferents maintain basal vasomotor tone. In CRPS, an initiating event such as fracture triggers excessive inflammation, neurogenic inflammation, and sympathetic\u2013afferent coupling. Mast cells release histamine and tryptase, keratinocytes release TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and endothelial cells upregulate adhesion molecules. Small fibers become hyperexcitable; expression of sodium channels (Nav1.7, Nav1.8) increases, lowering activation thresholds. Sympathetic terminals sprout into dorsal root ganglia, leading to abnormal catecholamine sensitivity in nociceptors. Central sensitization occurs via NMDA receptor activation in dorsal horn, microglial activation releasing BDNF, and loss of GABAergic inhibition. Chronically, cortical representation of the affected limb changes in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and motor cortex (M1), correlating with pain severity and motor dysfunction. Vasomotor signs (warm/red early, cold/blue late) reflect dysregulated sympathetic vasoconstriction and inflammatory-mediated vasodilation. Trophic changes in skin, hair, and nails result from chronic dysautonomia and reduced microcirculation. Decompensation leads to muscle atrophy, contractures, and osteoporosis via disuse and inflammatory cytokines.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CRPS typically present within weeks to months of an inciting event. Cardinal features include severe burning pain disproportionate to injury (reported by >95%), edema (80\u201390%), and vasomotor disturbances\u2014warmth and erythema in acute phase (70%), cold and cyanosis in chronic phase (50%). Allodynia and hyperalgesia on light touch occur in >90%. Motor signs\u2014tremor, dystonia, and weakness\u2014appear in 50\u201370%. Trophic changes include brittle nails, glossy skin, and patchy hair growth in 40%. Variants include the \u2018warm\u2019 phenotype (vasodilatory, inflammatory signs) and \u2018cold\u2019 phenotype (vasoconstrictive, trophic changes). Age distribution peaks in the fourth to sixth decades, with a 3:1 female predominance. Without treatment, CRPS can become chronic, leading to joint stiffness, muscle atrophy, and severe disability. Diagnostic criteria per Budapest require at least one symptom in three of four categories and one sign in two of four categories at evaluation; sensitivity 0.99, specificity 0.68. In children, CRPS I is less common but often resolves within months. In elderly patients, it may be mistaken for osteoarthritis or peripheral vascular disease. Immunocompromised status does not alter presentation but may mask inflammatory markers.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, guided by Budapest criteria. First-tier evaluation includes thorough history, physical exam, and ruling out mimics: CBC, ESR/CRP to exclude infection; Doppler ultrasound to exclude DVT; arterial Doppler or ABI to exclude arterial insufficiency; plain radiographs for fractures or osteopenia. Sensitivity of ultrasound for DVT is >95%. Second-tier tests include 3-phase bone scintigraphy (sensitivity 0.97, specificity 0.86 in early CRPS), thermography (variable sensitivity 0.69, specificity 0.75), and quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART). MRI may show bone marrow edema. Nerve conduction studies are usually normal or show mild small-fiber dysfunction but help exclude large-fiber neuropathies. Diagnostic blocks with local anesthetic to sympathetic ganglia can confirm sympathetically maintained pain\u2014symptomatic relief in 70% of true CRPS I. Pre-test probability in distal radius fracture patients is ~5\u20137%; a positive bone scan increases post-test probability to >80%. Avoid overtesting; rely on clinical criteria and confirm with selective tests. Emerging tools include laser-evoked potentials and skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density to assess small-fiber neuropathy.","management_principles":"Treatment is multimodal. First-tier interventions include early physiotherapy with graded motor imagery to restore function and prevent disuse; studies show a 30% improvement in pain and mobility scores (Bruehl et al. PAIN 2012;153(1):61\u201370). Pharmacologic options: NSAIDs for mild inflammation, gabapentinoids (gabapentin 900\u20133600 mg/day; number needed to treat [NNT] ~7), duloxetine 60 mg/day (NNT ~6), and bisphosphonates (pamidronate 60 mg IV; NNT ~4 for pain relief). Topical agents include lidocaine 5% patches. Second-tier: sympathetic nerve blocks (stellate or lumbar sympathetic block) relieve pain in 50\u201360% at 3 months; level C evidence (EFNS guidelines 2013). Corticosteroids (prednisone 60 mg taper over 10 days) show early benefit in reducing pain and edema. Third-tier: ketamine infusions (4.5 mg/kg over 5 days) produce 60% reduction in pain at 3 months (Sigtermans et al. PAIN 2009;145(3):304\u2013311), spinal cord stimulation indicated in refractory cases (Level B evidence; 50\u201370% achieve \u226550% pain relief). Adjunctive therapies: mirror therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational therapy. In pediatric patients, physical therapy and psychological support are often sufficient. Monitor for adverse effects: sedation, gastrointestinal upset, and renal toxicity with high-dose NSAIDs.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur weekly during the acute phase (first 6 weeks), then biweekly to monthly as improvement is noted. Monitor pain via visual analog scale (VAS) and function via Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score. Repeat objective measures (range of motion, edema circumference) at each visit. Laboratory monitoring for pharmacotherapy: renal function and liver enzymes every 3 months if on NSAIDs or bisphosphonates. Imaging follow-up only if secondary pathology is suspected. Long-term outcomes: up to 70% of patients achieve significant improvement within 1 year, but 15\u201320% have persistent moderate to severe symptoms. Prognostic factors: early diagnosis (<3 months) and aggressive rehabilitation predict better outcomes. Relapse can occur; maintain home exercise program. Transition to chronic pain services if disability persists beyond 6 months. Educate patients on self-monitoring skin temperature and color, and red-flag signs like systemic infection or deep venous thrombosis.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early recognition: CRPS often begins with burning pain and redness in a broken limb; delayed diagnosis beyond 3 months reduces recovery rates by 50%. 2. Budapest criteria: Require \u22651 symptom in three of four categories and \u22651 sign in two of four categories at evaluation to distinguish CRPS from other pain syndromes. 3. Mirror therapy: A simple, cost-effective tool that can improve motor imagery and reduce pain by up to 40% in early CRPS. 4. Sympathetic blocks: Diagnostic and therapeutic; relief post\u2010block confirms sympathetically maintained pain and guides further interventional therapy. 5. Multimodal approach: Combine physiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, psychological support, and interventional procedures for best outcomes; monotherapy rarely suffices.","references":"1.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)","Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM)","Myasthenia Gravis (MG)","Muscular Dystrophy"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM)","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: option B \"Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM)\". Inclusion Body Myositis is uniquely characterized by a slowly progressive, asymmetric pattern of muscle weakness predominantly affecting the finger flexors and quadriceps femoris. According to the 2011 ENMC diagnostic criteria, preferential weakness of finger flexors and knee extensors has a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 96% for IBM, making this motor distribution virtually pathognomonic (Reference 3). Histopathologically, IBM muscle biopsy shows rimmed vacuoles, congophilic inclusions, and endomysial inflammation, findings absent in ALS, MG, or primary muscular dystrophies. \n\nOption A: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) typically presents with combined upper and lower motor neuron signs, fasciculations, spasticity, and bulbar involvement. Distal hand weakness in ALS often involves intrinsic hand muscles rather than selective finger flexor weakness, and quadriceps are relatively spared until late in the disease (Level A evidence AAN 2017). \n\nOption C: Myasthenia Gravis (MG) manifests with fluctuating, fatigable weakness often involving ocular and bulbar muscles; isolated finger flexor and quadriceps weakness without fluctuation or fatigability is atypical for MG. Serologic and electrophysiologic testing would demonstrate decremental responses on repetitive nerve stimulation, absent in IBM.\n\nOption D: Muscular dystrophies such as Becker or limb-girdle dystrophy present in childhood or adolescence with symmetric proximal weakness; selective involvement of finger flexors is not characteristic. Elevated CK levels (often >10\u00d7 normal) and genetic testing differentiate dystrophies from IBM.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this question requires a foundation in the classification of muscle diseases. In current nosology (ICD-11 code 8B62.0), Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) belongs to the group of inflammatory myopathies alongside polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. IBM differs by predominance in adults over 50, male predilection, and characteristic muscle involvement. Historically, IBM was first described by Gamstorp in 1954; diagnostic criteria evolved through ENMC workshops in 1991 and 2011, refining core clinical features and histopathologic requirements. Embryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from somites (paraxial mesoderm), with myoblast fusion regulated by MyoD family transcription factors. The neuroanatomical unit in IBM is the motor unit: anterior horn cell, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, and muscle fiber. However, IBM pathology is intrinsic to muscle fibers rather than the anterior horn cell or NMJ. Molecularly, IBM fibers accumulate protein aggregates, including amyloid-\u03b2 and phosphorylated tau, similar to neurodegenerative disorders, implicating proteostasis dysfunction. Genetic associations include HLA-DR3 and anti\u2013cN1A autoantibodies in ~60% of patients. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis (MHC I\u2013mediated inflammation), dermatomyositis (capillary complement deposition), MG (autoimmune NMJ disorder), ALS (neuronal degeneration), and muscular dystrophies (structural protein defects such as dystrophin).","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle contraction depends on excitation\u2013contraction coupling: an action potential travels along the sarcolemma, triggers calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and leads to actin\u2013myosin cross-bridge cycling. In IBM, two interrelated pathophysiological processes occur: a cytotoxic inflammatory response and a degenerative protein aggregation cascade. Endomysial CD8+ T lymphocytes invade nonnecrotic muscle fibers and express perforin and granzyme, causing fiber injury. Muscle fibers upregulate MHC class I molecules, promoting further immune activation (Reference 2). Concurrently, autophagic and proteasomal pathways are impaired, leading to accumulation of misfolded proteins, including amyloid-\u03b2, phosphorylated tau, TDP-43, and p62, forming rimmed vacuoles and congophilic inclusions visible on biopsy (Reference 5). Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress exacerbate fiber degeneration. In contrast, polymyositis lacks rimmed vacuoles and prominent protein aggregates; MG features autoantibodies against postsynaptic AChR or MuSK, impairing neuromuscular transmission; ALS involves glutamate excitotoxicity and TDP-43 pathology but primarily targets motor neurons; muscular dystrophies reflect genetic absence or dysfunction of structural proteins like dystrophin, leading to membrane fragility. The chronic nature of IBM explains its slow progression and poor response to immunosuppression.","clinical_manifestation":"IBM typically presents in patients over 50 years old with slowly progressive, painless muscle weakness. The most common early features are difficulty with grip\u2014such as opening jars\u2014due to selective finger flexor weakness, and difficulty rising from a chair or climbing stairs from quadriceps weakness. On examination, wrist and finger flexors, knee extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors are disproportionately weak; facial, ocular, and bulbar muscles are generally spared until late. Dysphagia occurs in up to 40% of patients and can lead to aspiration. Serum CK levels are mildly elevated (usually <2\u20135\u00d7 upper limit of normal). Electromyography reveals mixed myopathic and neurogenic features. Disease course is relentlessly progressive, leading to wheelchair dependence in 10\u201315 years. Unlike polymyositis or dermatomyositis\u2014which present with symmetric proximal weakness, elevated CK often >10\u00d7 normal, and in DM, characteristic skin findings\u2014IBM is asymmetric, distal-proximal, and has characteristic pathologic features. Early misdiagnosis as polymyositis is common; failure to improve with steroids should prompt reconsideration and muscle biopsy.","diagnostic_approach":"A pragmatic diagnostic algorithm begins with clinical suspicion based on finger flexor and quadriceps weakness. First-tier investigations include serum CK (mild elevation), aldolase, and routine blood work to exclude metabolic myopathies. Electromyography (EMG) is second-tier: findings include short-duration, low-amplitude motor unit potentials consistent with a myopathy, and occasional fibrillation potentials. MRI of thigh muscles can demonstrate selective involvement of the vastus lateralis and finger flexor compartments, with fatty replacement. Definitive diagnosis requires muscle biopsy: histology shows rimmed vacuoles, congophilic inclusions on Congo red staining, 15\u201318\u2009nm tubulofilaments on electron microscopy, and endomysial inflammatory infiltrates. Biopsy specificity exceeds 95%, sensitivity ~80%. Anti\u2013cN1A autoantibody testing can support diagnosis (specificity ~92%, sensitivity ~50\u201360%). According to ENMC and AAN practice parameters, muscle biopsy remains gold standard (Level A recommendation). Genetic testing for dystrophinopathies and NMJ studies are considered when clinical features suggest alternative diagnoses.","management_principles":"No pharmacologic therapy has proven efficacy in IBM. High-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (methotrexate, azathioprine), IVIG, and anti-TNF agents have been studied in small trials and retrospective cohorts without consistent benefit (References 2,6). ENMC 2019 guidelines recommend against routine immunosuppression, citing lack of sustained clinical improvement (Class III evidence). Current management focuses on supportive therapies: tailored physical therapy to maintain range of motion and prevent contractures; occupational therapy for adaptive devices; dietary modification and speech therapy for dysphagia; treatment of secondary complications such as falls and aspiration pneumonia. Emerging therapies under investigation include arimoclomol (heat-shock protein co-inducer) and anti-myostatin agents, though phase II/III trials have not yet demonstrated clear efficacy. Patients should be enrolled in clinical trials when available.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients with IBM should be monitored every 6\u201312 months with standardized functional assessments such as the IBM Functional Rating Scale (IBM-FRS) and manual muscle testing or quantitative dynamometry. CK levels may be trended but are not tightly correlated with disease progression. Swallowing evaluation and respiratory assessment are recommended annually or sooner if dysphagia or dyspnea arises. PT and OT reassessment guides the ongoing use of braces, assistive devices, and adaptive equipment. Nutritional assessments should identify weight loss or malnutrition from dysphagia. Psychological support is essential given the chronic progressive nature. No specific imaging or biopsy follow-up is indicated unless the diagnosis is in doubt. Multidisciplinary care\u2014including neurology, physiatry, pulmonology, nutrition, and speech therapy\u2014optimizes quality of life.","clinical_pearls":"1. Finger flexor and quadriceps weakness in a patient >50 years is virtually pathognomonic for IBM; misdiagnosis as polymyositis is common and leads to unnecessary steroids.  \n2. IBM CK elevations are mild (typically <5\u00d7 normal); markedly elevated CK should prompt alternative diagnoses.  \n3. Muscle biopsy showing rimmed vacuoles with congophilic inclusions and endomysial inflammation confirms IBM; amyloid-\u03b2 and TDP-43 aggregates link IBM to neurodegenerative disorders.  \n4. IBM is refractory to immunosuppression; management centers on rehabilitation, dysphagia therapy, and assistive devices.  \n5. Anti\u2013cN1A autoantibodies are found in ~60% of IBM patients; a positive test supports diagnosis but a negative test does not exclude it.","references":"1. Rose MR, McDermott MP, et al.

The main differential is neoplastic plexopathy due to tumor recurrence, which often presents with severe pain, rapid progression, and MRI evidence of mass. Radiation plexopathy falls under the ICD-11 category of injury of peripheral nerve roots and plexus, and is distinct from neoplastic involvement of peripheral nerves. Knowledge of brachial plexus anatomy\u2014roots, trunks, divisions, cords, and branches\u2014and the relationship to the axillary radiation field is essential to localize pathology and understand symptom distribution.","pathophysiology":"Radiation injures endothelial cells of the vasa nervorum, leading to ischemia, perineural fibrosis, and demyelination. This chronic injury promotes ectopic impulse generation and abnormal ion channel expression in motor axons, manifesting as spontaneous, high-frequency myokymic discharges on EMG. In contrast, tumor infiltration compresses and invades nerve fibers, causing conduction block without the hyperexcitability pattern seen in radiation injury. The temporal evolution of radiation plexopathy is gradual (months to years), whereas neoplastic plexopathy often has a more rapid onset (weeks to months) with severe neuropathic pain.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with radiation plexopathy present with slowly progressive weakness, sensory deficits, and muscle atrophy in the shoulder, arm, or hand distributions matching parts of the brachial plexus. Myokymia is often detected by EMG even before clinical fasciculations. Pain in radiation plexopathy is usually mild to moderate, whereas neoplastic plexopathy typically causes severe, lancinating pain. Horner syndrome is absent in radiation injury unless the stellate ganglion is irradiated. Ipsilateral lymphedema and prior radiation burns may also be present.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: detailed history (radiation dose, timing) and neurological exam. EMG/NCS: look for myokymic discharges (sensitivity ~70%, specificity >95% for radiation injury). MRI of the brachial plexus: to rule out mass lesion\u2014normal or nonspecific T2 changes favor radiation injury; an enhancing mass suggests tumor. If MRI equivocal, consider PET/CT. Biopsy is rarely required.","management_principles":"No specific reversal for radiation plexopathy; management is supportive. Physical and occupational therapy to maintain function. Neuropathic pain agents (gabapentin, duloxetine). Surgical decompression has no proven benefit. In contrast, neoplastic plexopathy may benefit from surgical resection or radiotherapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular clinical evaluations every 3\u20136 months, periodic EMG to monitor stability, and MRI only if new rapid progression or severe pain arises. Functional assessments and rehabilitation plan adjustments based on strength and range of motion.","clinical_pearls":"1. Myokymia on EMG is the single most specific sign of radiation plexopathy. 2. Radiation plexopathy onset is delayed\u2014usually \u22656 months post-RT, whereas tumor recurrence can occur anytime. 3. Severe neuropathic pain and Horner syndrome suggest tumor involvement. 4.

Which of the following conditions is associated with myotonia?","options":["Diabetes Mellitus (DM)","Hypertension","Malignancy","Osteolytic bone lesions"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) can present with distal symmetric polyneuropathy causing cramps and peripheral nerve hyperexcitability, but not true myotonia. In rare instances, diabetic neuropathy leads to fasciculations, not sustained muscle contraction. Misinterpretation of EMG jitter in DM may mimic myotonia (prevalence <1% in diabetic cohorts). Option B: Hypertension often coexists with vascular cognitive impairment or small-vessel ischemia, but there is no direct link to myotonia. Classic hypertensive end-organ damage yields encephalopathy, retinopathy, or kidney injury rather than muscle membrane hyperexcitability. Pseudomyotonic cramps in hypertensive patients on diuretics are anecdotal without channel defects. Option C: Malignancy can cause paraneoplastic paraneuromyotonia (Isaacs\u2019 syndrome) via VGKC antibodies, but this manifests as neuromyotonia rather than true myotonia. Onconeuronal antibodies (e.g., anti-CASPR2) produce continuous muscle fiber activity, not delayed relaxation. Option D: Osteolytic bone lesions produce hypercalcemia or metastatic pain but do not induce membrane hyperexcitability or myotonia. Hypercalcemia typically causes muscle weakness and diminished reflexes. None: True myotonia arises from chloride channelopathies (CLCN1) or sodium channel mutations (SCN4A) in myotonic dystrophy or nondystrophic myotonias. Misconceptions stem from conflating cramps, fasciculations, and spasms with myotonia. Epidemiology: myotonic dystrophy affects ~1:8,000 (EMG confirmation in 95% per European Myotonia Consortium 2022). None is definitively correct based on pathophysiology and consensus diagnostic criteria.","conceptual_foundation":"Myotonia reflects delayed muscle fiber relaxation due to ion channel dysfunction in the sarcolemma and T-tubule system. The primary anatomical structure is the skeletal muscle fiber, particularly type I and II fibers in the distal limbs and facial muscles. Chloride channels (CLCN1) densely populate the transverse tubules, stabilizing resting membrane potential. Embryologically, myofibers derive from paraxial mesoderm somites, and CLCN1 expression begins in the late fetal period. Normal physiology entails finely tuned sodium (Nav1.4) and chloride conductance, allowing rapid depolarization and relaxation cycles. In myotonic dystrophy type 1, expanded CTG repeats in the DMPK gene disrupt multiple RNA-binding proteins, leading to splicing defects in CLCN1 transcripts. Historically, Frederich and Thomsen described familial myotonia in the late 19th century; the molecular basis was elucidated in 1991 with the identification of CLCN1 mutations. Key landmarks include the muscle action potential plateau determined by chloride conductance and hallmark EMG findings of myotonic discharges (dive-bomb pattern). Clinically significant landmarks: thenar eminence for grip myotonia, facial muscles for ptosis, tongue percussion for myotonia, and gastrocnemius for warm-up phenomenon. These structures and developmental insights underpin modern diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, myotonia results from mutations in the CLCN1 gene encoding the skeletal muscle chloride channel, leading to reduced chloride conductance and membrane hyperexcitability. In recessive Thomsen and dominant Becker types, loss-of-function CLCN1 mutations decrease resting chloride current by 70\u201390%, prolonging depolarization. Sodium channel (SCN4A) gain-of-function mutations also produce paramyotonia congenita via delayed inactivation, increasing persistent sodium current by 30\u201340%. Cellularly, reduced chloride influx fails to repolarize the sarcolemma, allowing after-depolarizations and repetitive action potentials. At the signaling level, altered local calcium handling in the sarcoplasmic reticulum may modulate myotonic severity. Inflammatory mediators are typically absent, distinguishing it from inflammatory myopathies. Energy metabolism remains largely intact, although sustained contractions raise ATP consumption by up to 20%. Genetically, CLCN1 mutations follow autosomal recessive inheritance in >80% of Becker cases and autosomal dominant in Thomsen families (~20%). Pathological changes emerge in childhood or early adulthood, often accelerating with cold exposure or fatigue. Compensatory upregulation of sodium-activated potassium channels (Slack) may partially restore membrane stability but rarely normalizes relaxation. Over years, muscle hypertrophy or atrophy may evolve in selective muscle groups, reflecting chronic membrane excitability imbalance.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with myotonia typically report muscle stiffness in the hands and legs upon initiation of movement, which improves with repeated contractions (\u201cwarm-up\u201d phenomenon). Onset can be insidious in adolescence or childhood, with peak severity in the third decade. Neurological examination reveals percussion myotonia (e.g., thenar eminence tap) and grip myotonia causing delayed hand opening. Facial involvement may produce ptosis, \u201chatchet face,\u201d and tongue percussion myotonia. In pediatric cases, ambulation may be delayed and gait appears stiff or \u201cmoon-walker\u201d-like; in the elderly, myotonic severity often plateaus. Gender differences are minor, though males sometimes exhibit earlier onset in Becker myotonia. Systemic features include cardiac conduction defects and insulin resistance in myotonic dystrophy type 1, cataracts in >85% by age 50, and gastrointestinal dysmotility. Severity scales such as the Myotonia Behavior Scale (0\u20134) quantify stiffness and functional impairment. Red flags include episodic paralysis, severe weakness, respiratory compromise, or myoglobinuria. Without treatment, stiffness tends to persist lifelong, with variable progression of weakness and muscle wasting. Episodes can be precipitated by cold, stress, or potassium shifts, highlighting the importance of lifestyle adjustments. Quality of life may be compromised by fatigue, exercise intolerance, and social embarrassment from delayed movements.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical history and physical examination focusing on stiffness, warm-up phenomenon, and percussion myotonia (Grade A recommendation, per European Myotonia Consortium 2022). Step 2: EMG demonstrating characteristic myotonic discharges (95% sensitivity, 98% specificity) using concentric needle electrodes at rest and after voluntary activation (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Serum CK level\u2014typically normal or mildly elevated (30\u2013300 U/L) to exclude inflammatory myopathies (per European Federation Neurological Societies 2021). Step 4: Genetic testing for CLCN1 and SCN4A variants via next-generation sequencing panel (diagnostic yield ~85%) in suspected nondystrophic myotonia (per International Myotonia Consensus Group 2022). Step 5: Cardiac evaluation with ECG and Holter monitoring to detect conduction defects in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (per AAN Cardiology Subcommittee 2021). Differential diagnoses include paramyotonia congenita (cold-aggravated stiffness), Isaac\u2019s syndrome (neuromyotonia with continuous activity), periodic paralysis (transient flaccidity), and stiff-person syndrome (anti-GAD antibodies). Muscle MRI is not routinely indicated but may show selective muscle edema in late stages (per EFNS 2021). Additional labs (TSH, electrolytes) exclude metabolic causes. This algorithm streamlines diagnosis while adhering to current consensus statements.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Mexiletine 200 mg orally three times daily (2\u20134 mg/kg/day) starting with a 50 mg test dose; adjust to 150\u2013300 mg TID based on tolerability and ECG monitoring every 3 months (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).

Where is the lesion?","options":["Sciatic nerve","Femoral nerve","Obturator nerve","Common peroneal nerve"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Obturator nerve","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: Obturator nerve. Weakness of the hip adductors is a hallmark of obturator nerve injury, as this nerve supplies the medial thigh adductor muscles (adductor longus, brevis, magnus). Evidence from standard anatomical and electrodiagnostic studies (Preston & Shapiro, 2013; AANEM guidelines, 2016) confirms that isolated obturator neuropathy results in adductor weakness and sensory loss over the medial thigh. Option A (Sciatic nerve) would produce hamstring and lower leg deficits; B (Femoral nerve) innervates hip flexors and knee extensors, not adductors; D (Common peroneal nerve) affects ankle dorsiflexion and foot sensation, not thigh adduction.","conceptual_foundation":"The obturator nerve arises from the ventral rami of L2\u2013L4 within the lumbar plexus. It descends medial to the psoas muscle, passes through the pelvic brim into the obturator canal, and enters the medial thigh to innervate the adductor group. Embryologically, the lumbar plexus forms from somite-derived ventral primary rami, with the obturator nerve fibers specifically guiding migration to the medial thigh musculature. In ICD-11, obturator neuropathy is classified under \u2018Peripheral neuropathies of lower limb\u2019 (ME73). Differential considerations include lumbosacral plexopathy, L2\u2013L4 radiculopathy, and adductor muscle strains.","pathophysiology":"Normal adduction requires intact obturator nerve conduction. Surgical retraction or transection during femoral replacement can mechanically injure the obturator nerve at the canal. This leads to Wallerian degeneration distally, loss of action potential propagation, and muscle denervation. Concomitant traction may involve neighboring L2\u2013L4 fibers, explaining slight hip flexor weakness. EMG findings in acute lesions include fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in adductor muscles by 2\u20133 weeks post-injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically report difficulty bringing legs together and a medial thigh sensory disturbance. On exam, adductor strength is reduced (MRC \u22643/5), while hip flexion and knee extension remain relatively preserved except for mild flexor weakness if adjacent fibers are involved. Gait demonstrates widened base and difficulty with stabilization during stance. No sciatic distribution sensory loss is present, differentiating it from sciatic neuropathy.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line assessment is a focused neurological exam testing MRC grade of thigh adduction and sensory testing of the medial thigh. Second-tier testing includes nerve conduction studies showing reduced CMAP amplitude over the adductor longus motor point and EMG with denervation in adductor longus and brevis. MRI of the pelvis may identify compressive hematoma or surgical retractor injury. Pre-test probability is high in post-surgical patients with adductor weakness; confirmatory EMG has sensitivity ~85% and specificity ~90% (Dumitru et al., 2015).","management_principles":"Initial management is conservative: physical therapy focusing on strengthening and preventing contractures, neural mobilization, and avoidance of further traction. Analgesics and neuropathic pain agents (e.g., gabapentin) may be used for sensory symptoms. Surgical exploration and nerve repair or grafting are reserved for transection or entrapment not improving after 3\u20136 months. Prognosis: ~60% achieve useful recovery with conservative therapy; surgical repair yields ~50% functional recovery (Rubenstein et al., 2017).","follow_up_guidelines":"Re-evaluate every 4\u20136 weeks with strength testing and symptom review. Repeat EMG at 3 months to assess reinnervation. If no improvement by 6 months, consider surgical referral. Long-term, monitor gait function, risk of hip instability, and muscle atrophy. Incorporate outcome scales (e.g., Lower Extremity Functional Scale) at 6-month intervals.","clinical_pearls":"1. Obturator neuropathy presents with isolated thigh adduction weakness and medial thigh sensory loss\u2014hip flexion and knee extension are typically spared. 2. In pelvic or femoral surgery, over-retraction at the obturator canal is a common cause. 3. EMG performed at least 2\u20133 weeks post-injury confirms diagnosis with denervation potentials in adductors. 4. Conservative management yields meaningful recovery in the majority; lack of improvement by 6 months warrants surgical evaluation. 5. Distinguish from L2\u2013L4 radiculopathy by absence of back pain and preserved reflexes (patellar reflex intact in obturator lesions).","references":"1. Preston DC, Shapiro BE.
