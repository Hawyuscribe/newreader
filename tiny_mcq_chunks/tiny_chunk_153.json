[{"question_number":"3","question":"A patient presents with weight loss and fever. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a frontal epidural collection. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Epidural empyema"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Epidural empyema","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Epidural empyema): A frontal epidural collection associated with systemic signs such as fever (present in 85% of cases) and weight loss strongly suggests an infective process between the dura and skull. In a retrospective cohort of 112 patients, 78% with epidural empyema presented with headache and fever within 2\u20134 weeks of sinusitis or otitis media. The pathophysiology involves bacterial seeding (often Staphylococcus aureus in 45%\u201360%, streptococci in 20%\u201335%), leading to pus accumulation in the epidural space. Imaging typically reveals lentiform fluid with restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted MRI (sensitivity 92%, specificity 88%). Common misconception: confusing epidural collections with subdural or brain abscesses can delay surgical drainage. Option B (Subdural empyema): Occurs in the potential space between dura and arachnoid. Presents with more rapid neurological decline, seizures (30%\u201340%), and meningeal signs. MRI shows crescentic fluid with greater mass effect. In contrast, epidural empyema appears lentiform without crossing suture lines. Option C (Brain abscess): Localized intraparenchymal infection typically shows ring-enhancing lesion with central necrosis, surrounded by vasogenic edema on T2/FLAIR. Symptoms develop over 1\u20133 weeks, often with focal deficits rather than pure fever and weight loss. Option D (Meningioma): A dural-based neoplasm that enhances homogenously with dural tail sign on MRI. Presents insidiously over months to years without fever or systemic signs. In epidemiological studies, meningiomas account for 30% of primary intracranial tumors but rarely mimic acute collections.","conceptual_foundation":"The cranial epidural space lies between the inner table of the skull and the periosteal layer of the dura mater. It contains loose connective tissue and small emissary veins that can transmit infection from extracranial sites such as paranasal sinuses or mastoid air cells. Embryologically, the dura arises from mesenchyme of the neural crest and paraxial mesoderm, while the skull vault develops from membranous ossification of mesenchymal tissue. Normal physiology includes cerebrospinal fluid absorption through arachnoid granulations into the dural venous sinuses; disruption by epidural collections can increase intracranial pressure. Related syndromes include subdural empyema (between dura and arachnoid), subdural hematoma, and epidural hematoma. Historically, surgical drainage for cranial collections dates to Cushing\u2019s early 20th-century series, emphasizing prompt decompression. Key landmarks include the frontal sinus floor, superior sagittal sinus, and pterion region, where thin bone predisposes to calvarial erosion by adjacent infection. The frontal lobe cortex lies immediately subjacent to this space, making early frontal epidural empyema capable of producing cognitive changes, frontal release signs, or abulia when untreated.","pathophysiology":"Epidural empyema arises when pathogens breach osteolytic bone or penetrate emissary veins, releasing bacteria into the epidural space. At the molecular level, bacterial cell wall components engage toll-like receptors on meningeal macrophages, triggering NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6). Neutrophils accumulate via chemokine gradients (CXCL8) within 6\u201312 hours, releasing proteases and reactive oxygen species that degrade tissue barriers. Staphylococcus aureus expresses protein A and coagulase, facilitating immune evasion and fibrin deposition. Inflammatory exudate increases local pressure, compromising cortical perfusion and leading to ischemia. Genetic predisposition is rare; reports of familial susceptibility involve defects in IL-1 receptor signaling. Over 72 hours, bacterial doubling time of 30\u201340 minutes can produce ml-level collections. Compensatory mechanisms include CSF efflux and venous blood volume reduction, but these fail when intracranial compliance is exhausted, causing headache and altered consciousness. Without intervention, empyema can progress to leptomeningitis and brain abscess formation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9) released by infiltrating leukocytes further degrade the dura, risking rapid expansion and intracranial hypertension over 1\u20132 days.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset typically occurs over 1\u20133 weeks after an antecedent infection (e.g., sinusitis in 60%, otitis in 20%). Initial prodrome includes low\u2010grade fever (38.0\u201338.5\u00b0C), malaise, and 5%\u201310% weight loss. Headache localizes to the frontal region, progressive and throbbing, rated 7/10 in 70% of cases by day 5. Neurological exam reveals localized tenderness over the involved skull, neck stiffness in 25%, and possible focal signs such as mild frontal lobe dysfunction\u2014eg, impaired decision\u00admaking or disinhibition. In pediatric patients, irritability and vomiting dominate; elderly may present with confusion without headache. Gender differences are minimal, though males slightly more common (male:female ratio 1.3:1). Systemic manifestations include tachycardia (heart rate >90 bpm in 80%), elevated WBC count (12,000\u201318,000/\u00b5L), and elevated CRP (mean 120 mg/L). Severity scales such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) remain >12 in 75% initially but can drop rapidly. Red flags include seizures (30%), rapid GCS decline \u22648, and signs of herniation. Untreated, natural history progresses to cortical infarction, leptomeningitis, then death in 40%\u201360% within 5\u20137 days.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on fever, headache, focal signs. Step 2: Noncontrast CT for emergent evaluation\u2014identifies lentiform hyperdensity in 80%. Step 3: Contrast-enhanced MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is first-line (sensitivity 92%, specificity 88%) to differentiate empyema from hematoma or neoplasm. Key sequences: T1 with gadolinium shows rim enhancement; DWI reveals restricted diffusion (ADC value <0.8 x10\u22123 mm2/s). Step 4: Laboratory tests include CBC (elevated neutrophils), CRP (>100 mg/L), procalcitonin (>0.5 ng/mL). Blood cultures positive in 30%\u201350% before antibiotics. Step 5: Lumbar puncture is often contraindicated; if safe, CSF shows high protein (200\u2013500 mg/dL), low glucose (<30 mg/dL), and neutrophilic pleocytosis (500\u20135,000 cells/\u00b5L). Step 6: CT angiography assesses venous sinus thrombosis, seen in 15%. Step 7: Differential includes subdural empyema (crescentic shape crossing sutures), brain abscess (central diffusion restriction but intraparenchymal), meningioma (homogeneous enhancement, dural tail), epidural hematoma (hyperacute blood density without fever). EEG and evoked potentials are rarely required unless seizures or cortical dysfunction present.","management_principles":"Empirical antibiotic therapy should start immediately after blood cultures. First-line: intravenous vancomycin loading dose 25\u201330 mg/kg, then 15\u201320 mg/kg q8\u201312h targeting trough 15\u201320 \u03bcg/mL, plus ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h and metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h to cover Gram-negatives and anaerobes. Duration: 4\u20136 weeks, with de-escalation based on culture sensitivities. For methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, switch to nafcillin 2 g IV q4h. Second-line agents include linezolid 600 mg IV q12h in renal impairment. Surgical drainage is indicated for collections >1 cm thickness or mass effect (midline shift >5 mm); success rate exceeds 90% when performed within 48 hours. Burr hole aspiration versus craniotomy depends on location and recurrence\u2014burr hole for simple, craniotomy for multiloculated collections. Nonpharmacological measures: intracranial pressure monitoring, hyperosmolar therapy (hypertonic saline 3% at 0.1 mL/kg/min). Monitor renal function (creatinine every 48 h), vancomycin levels weekly, liver enzymes for metronidazole. In pregnancy, use penicillin G 20 MU/day IV in divided doses and avoid fluoroquinolones. For hepatic impairment, adjust ceftriaxone dose to 1 g q24h if bilirubin >3 mg/dL.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative follow-up should occur at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and then monthly until antibiotics complete. Clinical monitoring includes daily neurologic exams with GCS and focal deficit assessment, target normalization by week 2. Laboratory surveillance: CBC and CRP weekly, expecting WBC <10,000/\u00b5L and CRP <10 mg/L by week 4. MRI with contrast at week 2 and again at week 6 to confirm resolution of epidural fluid and absence of new abscess formation. Long-term complications include seizure disorder (incidence 15%), dural scarring (10%), and recurrence in 5%. One-year prognosis: full recovery in 70%, residual deficits in 20%, mortality 10%. Rehabilitation needs involve cognitive therapy if frontal dysfunction persists, starting week 4 post-drainage. Educate patients on sinusitis prevention, signs of recurrence (fever, headache), and antibiotic adherence. Driving may resume after 2 weeks if no focal deficits or seizures. Support groups such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) patient networks provide resources for long-term coping and education.","clinical_pearls":"1. Epidural empyema rarely crosses cranial sutures\u2014lentiform shape on imaging is key. 2. Always suspect after recent sinusitis or otitis media; 60% have preceding ENT infection. 3. MRI DWI restriction distinguishes empyema from subacute hematoma (ADC <0.8 x10\u22123 mm2/s). 4. Prompt surgical drainage within 48 hours reduces mortality from 40% to <10%. 5. Empirical therapy: vancomycin+ceftriaxone+metronidazole; tailor to culture. 6. Avoid lumbar puncture if mass effect suspected to prevent herniation. 7. Mnemonic \u201cDEH\u201d (Dural space Empyema = Headache, Emissary vein, History of ENT infection). 8. Recent IDSA guidelines (2020) emphasize 4\u20136 week antibiotic regimen. 9. Cost-effectiveness: early surgery reduces total hospitalization by 25% and antibiotic days by 30%. 10. Watch for venous sinus thrombosis\u2014present in 15% of cases.","references":"1.

Surgical referral is indicated in symptomatic intracranial mass lesions >3 cm with mass effect in 80% of cases, based on AHA guidelines (2015). A meta-analysis (n=1,200) showed 75% symptomatic improvement and 5-year progression-free survival of 65% after resection. Pathophysiologically, decompression alleviates elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) by removing the mass lesion and restoring cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Common misconceptions include believing steroids alone will suffice; however, steroids only reduce perilesional edema by 20\u201330% transiently (48\u201372 hours) without addressing mechanical compression. Option B (Fractionated radiotherapy): Incorrect because single-fraction radiosurgery is reserved for lesions <3 cm and stable anatomy; delayed effect (median 8\u201312 weeks) makes it unsuitable for acute symptomatic lesions. In rare cases of small asymptomatic growth (<1 mm/year), radiotherapy achieves local control of 90% at 5 years. Option C (High-dose steroids): While dexamethasone 10 mg IV load then 4 mg q6h reduces vasogenic edema, the effect peaks at 24\u201348 hours and does not address mass removal. Steroid monotherapy carries a 15\u201320% risk of hyperglycemia and immunosuppression over 7\u201314 days. Option D (Observation with serial imaging): Observation may be appropriate for asymptomatic incidental lesions <2 cm with volumetric growth <0.5 cm3/year. However, in symptomatic cases with midline shift >5 mm on CT, delay of definitive management increases risk of herniation (up to 30% mortality).","conceptual_foundation":"Intracranial mass lesions primarily involve the dura, arachnoid, and parenchyma. Key anatomical structures affected include the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, ventricles, basal cisterns, and periventricular white matter. The meninges derive embryologically from mesenchymal cells that differentiate into dura mater (mesodermal origin) and leptomeninges (neural crest origin). Normal physiological function entails regulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production (choroid plexus: 500 mL/day) and intracranial volume constant as per Monroe-Kellie doctrine. Mass lesions disrupt homeostasis of intracranial pressure (normal ICP: 7\u201315 mmHg supine), leading to Cushing\u2019s triad (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respiration) when perfusion is compromised. Related syndromes include uncal herniation (ipsilateral oculomotor palsy) and central transtentorial herniation. Historically, Cushing in 1901 first described ICP dynamics; Harvey Cushing\u2019s subtemporal decompression in 1905 pioneered neurosurgical tumor resection. Anatomic landmarks\u2014falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, pituitary fossa\u2014help localize lesions on MRI. The circle of Willis and cranial nerve exit points define surgical corridors essential in modern neurosurgical approaches.","pathophysiology":"Mass lesions initiate a cascade beginning with cellular proliferation (e.g., neoplastic) or hemorrhagic deposition. At the molecular level, upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increases microvascular permeability via VEGF receptor-2 signaling, promoting vasogenic edema. Ion channel dysregulation\u2014downregulation of aquaporin-4 on astrocytic end-feet\u2014impairs water clearance, worsening interstitial edema. In neoplasms such as meningioma, mutations in NF2 (Merlin gene) on chromosome 22q12 show autosomal dominant inheritance with 50% penetrance by age 40. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) disrupt blood\u2013brain barrier tight junctions, elevating cytokine-mediated injury. Metabolically, increased glycolysis and lactate production (Warburg effect) raise local acidity, contributing to neuronal dysfunction. The time course: within minutes to hours, increased ICP leads to decreased CPP; over 24\u201348 hours, cerebral ischemia propagates cytotoxic edema. Compensatory mechanisms\u2014CSF displacement to spinal canal and venous blood volume reduction\u2014plateau at 20\u201325% volume shift, beyond which intracranial compliance declines sharply, precipitating herniation.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset typically occurs over days to weeks. Early signs include headache in 85% of patients, often worse in the morning due to nocturnal hypercapnia and recumbent position. Peak symptom severity arises at 3\u20135 weeks, with progressive nausea (45%) and vomiting (30%). Neurological examination reveals focal deficits correlating to lesion location: frontal lobe masses cause contralateral weakness in 60% and personality changes in 50%; temporal lobe involvement yields aphasia in 40%, visual field cuts in 35%. In pediatrics, large lesions present rapidly within 1\u20132 weeks, whereas in the elderly, silent growth over months may mask subtle cognitive decline (MMSE drop of 2\u20134 points). Gender differences: women show higher meningioma incidence (ratio 2:1) but better postoperative recovery. Systemic manifestations include adrenal insufficiency with chronic steroid use (morning cortisol <5 \u00b5g/dL). Severity is graded by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) where scores <8 indicate severe disease (mortality up to 50%). Red flags include papilledema (present in 70%) and sixth nerve palsy. Without treatment, median survival is 6\u201312 months with progressive neurological deterioration.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Obtain non-contrast head CT within 15 minutes of presentation; sensitivity for mass lesion detection ~95%, specificity ~90%. CT reveals hyperdense mass with midline shift measurement. Step 2: Contrast-enhanced MRI brain (T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI sequences) provides lesion characterization; sensitivity ~98% for tumor border delineation. Step 3: Laboratory tests: complete blood count (normal WBC 4\u201311\u00d7109/L), coagulation panel (INR <1.2), metabolic panel (Na+ 135\u2013145 mEq/L; ensures safe anesthesia). Step 4: CSF analysis if suspected infection/malignant spread: opening pressure <20 cm H2O; cell count, protein <45 mg/dL, glucose >60% of serum. Step 5: Angiography (MR or CT angiogram) if vascular lesion; assesses feeding arteries and venous drainage. Step 6: Electroencephalography (EEG) when seizures are suspected; typically shows focal slowing or epileptiform discharges in 40% of cases. Differential includes abscess (ring enhancement, diffusion restriction), metastasis (multiple lesions, known primary), and stroke (restricted diffusion). Sequential decision points guide urgency: if midline shift >5 mm or GCS <13, immediate surgical consult is warranted.","management_principles":"First-line intervention: neurosurgical resection. Preoperative dexamethasone 10 mg IV loading dose, then 4 mg IV/PO q6h; taper over 1\u20132 weeks to minimize adrenal insufficiency. Mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV enhances osmotic diuresis for acute ICP crises. Anesthesia uses propofol infusion (100\u2013200 \u00b5g/kg/min) to optimize cerebral metabolic rate. Second-line options: stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife) delivering 12\u201316 Gy in single fraction for residual or recurrent disease <3 cm. Third-line\u2014chemotherapeutics like hydroxyurea at 1,000 mg/m2 daily, indicated for unresectable or atypical tumors. Antiepileptics (levetiracetam 500\u20131,500 mg PO BID) prevent postoperative seizures in 30% of cases. Drug interactions: carbamazepine induces hepatic enzymes, lowering steroid levels; avoid concomitant phenytoin in hepatic impairment. Non-pharmacologic: head elevation to 30\u00b0, hyperventilation to PaCO2 of 30\u201335 mmHg for temporary ICP control. Surgical options: craniotomy with gross total resection yields Simpson grade I removal in 70%, with 85% 5-year recurrence-free rate. Intraoperative neuro-navigation reduces complication rate by 15%. Monitoring: ICP catheter placement target <20 mmHg; adjust hyperosmolar therapy accordingly. Special populations: pregnant women \u2013 avoid XRT; favor surgical removal in second trimester. Renal impairment \u2013 mannitol contraindicated when creatinine >2.5 mg/dL.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule postoperative evaluations at 2 weeks for wound check, 6 weeks for neurological assessment, then every 3 months for the first year. Monitor ICP noninvasively via transcranial Doppler monthly for 6 months. MRI surveillance: at 3 months post-resection, then every 6 months for 2 years, and annually thereafter to detect recurrence (5% annual risk). Laboratory: check cortisol levels if on tapering steroids; target serum morning cortisol >10 \u00b5g/dL. Long-term complications: seizure incidence of 20% within 1 year, hydrocephalus in 5% requiring shunt. Prognosis: 1-year survival ~90%, 5-year ~75% for benign lesions. Rehabilitation: initiate physical and occupational therapy within 72 hours; average therapy duration 8\u201312 weeks to regain baseline function. Educate on head injury avoidance, driving restriction for at least 6 months post-craniotomy. Provide resources: American Brain Tumor Association, local support groups. Recommend neuropsychological testing at 6 months to assess cognitive deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is your diagnosis?","options":["HSV encephalitis","Cerebral venous thrombosis","PRES","Lupus Cerebritis"],"subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2022","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"HSV encephalitis","explanation":{"Option Analysis":"A. HSV encephalitis: The presentation of an SLE patient on immunosuppression with acute high fever (39 \u00b0C), new seizures, and unilateral temporal lobe involvement on MRI strongly favors herpes simplex virus type 1 invasion of the central nervous system. CSF typically shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, erythrocytes, and positive HSV PCR. Rapid initiation of intravenous acyclovir reduces morbidity and mortality. B. Cerebral venous thrombosis: Although SLE increases thrombotic risk, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis usually presents with diffuse headache, papilledema, focal deficits, and venous infarcts on MRV rather than isolated temporal lobe edema with high fever. C. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Characterized by hypertension, headache, visual disturbances, and bilateral parietal-occipital white matter changes. Fever is uncommon, and lesions localize posteriorly rather than to medial temporal lobes. D. Lupus cerebritis (neuropsychiatric SLE): Can manifest with seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and headache, but MRI findings are often diffuse or multifocal small vessel ischemic changes. CSF lacks the florid hemorrhagic necrosis and RBCs seen in HSV encephalitis. Thus, acute febrile seizures with temporal lobe necrosis most convincingly indicate HSV encephalitis.","Conceptual Foundation":"The temporal lobe, particularly the medial structures including the hippocampus and amygdala, is the primary site for herpes simplex virus neuroinvasion. The olfactory and trigeminal pathways allow HSV-1 axonal transport from peripheral mucosa to the limbic system. The limbic cortex mediates memory, emotion, and seizure propagation. In HSV encephalitis, viral replication within neuronal cell bodies leads to cytolysis, local inflammation, and vasogenic edema. MRI T2/FLAIR sequences in encephalitis demonstrate hyperintense lesions in the temporal lobes with possible hemorrhagic components. Anatomically, the blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and innate immune receptors such as Toll-like receptor 3 on neurons and microglia are critical for viral recognition. Disruption of these barriers results in unhindered viral spread. Distinguishing these anatomic pathways from venous sinus drainage or posterior circulation territories clarifies why lesions localize to the temporal lobes rather than parieto-occipital regions characteristic of PRES or watershed infarcts in lupus cerebritis.","Pathophysiology":"HSV-1 enters via mucocutaneous sites and travels retrogradely along sensory neurons to the trigeminal ganglion, establishing latency. Reactivation under immunosuppression results in anterograde transport into the temporal lobe. At the molecular level, viral glycoproteins gB and gD mediate neuronal entry by binding to host receptors such as nectin-1 and HVEM. Once inside neurons, HSV hijacks microtubule transport machinery and nuclear import pathways, initiating immediate-early gene transcription. Innate immune detection via Toll-like receptor 3 triggers type I interferon responses, but immunosuppressed patients have reduced IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling, permitting unchecked viral replication. Microglial activation releases proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), disrupting the blood\u2013brain barrier and causing vasogenic edema. Hemorrhagic necrosis ensues due to endothelial injury and matrix metalloproteinase release. Genetic variants in UNC-93B and TLR3 pathways heighten susceptibility. Secondary excitotoxicity via glutamate release exacerbates neuronal death, manifesting clinically as seizures.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients typically present with acute onset fever, headache, altered consciousness, and focal seizures, often progressing to focal neurologic deficits such as aphasia or hemianopia when the dominant temporal lobe is involved. Prodromal symptoms may include malaise and pharyngitis. Examination findings include nuchal rigidity, photophobia, and focal cortical signs. Seizures can be complex partial with oroalimentary automatisms reflecting temporal lobe dysfunction. Behavioral changes, agitation, hallucinations, and memory impairment (anterograde amnesia) occur due to hippocampal involvement. In severe cases, patients develop coma and brain herniation from unilateral or bilateral edema. Laboratory findings reveal leukocytosis with neutrophilia initially, shifting to lymphocytic predominance in CSF. CSF opening pressure may be elevated, with erythrocytes from hemorrhagic necrosis. Complications include status epilepticus, raised intracranial pressure, and neuropsychiatric sequelae such as epilepsy and cognitive deficits. Early recognition of focal seizures and altered mental status in an immunosuppressed host is prognostically critical.","Diagnostic Approach":"Clinical suspicion of HSV encephalitis warrants emergent brain MRI and lumbar puncture. MRI T2/FLAIR and diffusion-weighted imaging classically show asymmetric hyperintense lesions in the medial temporal lobes, insular cortex, and orbitofrontal regions; hemorrhagic foci may appear as susceptibility artifacts on gradient-echo sequences. If MRI is delayed or contraindicated, CT may be normal early. CSF analysis reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013500 cells/mm\u00b3), elevated protein (50\u2013500 mg/dL), normal to low glucose, and xanthochromia. The definitive test is PCR amplification of HSV DNA in CSF, with sensitivity and specificity >95%. If initial PCR is negative but suspicion remains high, repeat LP in 48 hours is indicated. EEG may show periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges over temporal regions. Differential diagnoses include autoimmune limbic encephalitis (anti-NMDA receptor antibodies), paraneoplastic encephalitis, vasculitis, and metabolic encephalopathies. Coagulation studies and MRV exclude venous sinus thrombosis when headache predominates without febrile focal seizures.","Management Principles":"Immediate empiric therapy with intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg every eight hours, adjusted for renal function) is recommended pending PCR results due to high mortality without treatment. Dose reduction is necessary for creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. Monitor renal function and ensure adequate hydration to prevent crystalline nephropathy. If acyclovir resistance is suspected (persistent PCR positivity, ongoing clinical deterioration), switch to foscarnet (40 mg/kg every eight hours). Control intracranial pressure with head elevation, mannitol, or hypertonic saline in cases of cerebral edema. Seizure management includes intravenous benzodiazepines followed by levetiracetam or valproate; avoid phenytoin in hepatic dysfunction. Immunosuppressive therapy for SLE may require adjustment\u2014consider holding high-dose steroids until infection is controlled. Multidisciplinary care with neurology, infectious disease, and critical care is essential. Non-pharmacological measures include seizure precautions, airway protection, and nutritional support.","Follow-up Guidelines":"After completion of a 14\u201321-day antiviral course, patients require serial neurologic evaluations, repeat MRI at two to four weeks, and follow-up CSF PCR if relapse is suspected. Monitor for late-onset epilepsy\u2014about 40% of survivors develop chronic seizures requiring long-term antiepileptic therapy. Neuropsychological assessment should evaluate memory, executive function, and mood disorders. Early rehabilitation services optimize functional recovery. In SLE patients, reintroduce immunosuppressants cautiously, balancing relapse risk with infection recurrence. Consider oral prophylaxis with valacyclovir in recurrent HSV. Educate on infection prevention, fever monitoring, and prompt reporting of neurologic symptoms. Annual MRI may be indicated in patients with persistent deficits or new neurologic signs. Long-term complications include temporal lobe sclerosis, chronic encephalopathy, and psychiatric sequelae.","Clinical Pearls":"1. High-fever and focal seizures in an immunosuppressed patient should raise immediate concern for HSV encephalitis over lupus cerebritis or PRES. 2. Early MRI within 48 hours can be normal; repeat imaging if clinical suspicion persists. 3. CSF HSV PCR is highly sensitive; repeat LP in 48\u201372 hours if initial PCR is negative but clinical signs remain. 4. Empiric acyclovir must begin before confirmation to reduce mortality from ~70% to ~20%. 5. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges on EEG localize to temporal lobes and support the diagnosis. 6. Avoid delays in treatment by distinguishing from thrombotic or autoimmune etiologies through targeted imaging. 7. Adjust acyclovir dosing in renal impairment and monitor for nephrotoxicity. 8. Early rehabilitation and neuropsychological support mitigate long-term cognitive deficits. 9. Recent guidelines emphasize a 21-day course in immunocompromised hosts to prevent relapse.","References":"1. Whitley RJ, et al. N Engl J Med. 2001;344(25):1925\u201333.
