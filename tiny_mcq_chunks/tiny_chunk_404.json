Ethosuximide is ineffective for atypical absences, and narrow-spectrum agents such as carbamazepine may worsen generalized seizure types in this syndrome.","conceptual_foundation":"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is classified under developmental and epileptic encephalopathies in recent ILAE frameworks and corresponds to G40.2 in ICD-11. It typically manifests between 3 and 5 years of age with multiple refractory seizure types and intellectual disability. Differential diagnoses include Dravet syndrome and other childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathies.","pathophysiology":"LGS involves diffuse cortical network dysfunction with impaired inhibition from GABAergic interneurons and excessive excitatory glutamatergic transmission. EEG slow spike-and-wave is generated by thalamocortical and cortico-cortical circuits. Valproate enhances GABAergic inhibition by inhibiting GABA transaminase and modulates sodium and T-type calcium channels.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients exhibit multiple daily seizures including tonic (often nocturnal, drop attacks), atypical absence with prolonged impairment of consciousness, and atonic or myoclonic events. Cognitive and behavioral regression is common, with developmental plateau or decline.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier workup: routine EEG showing generalized slow spike-and-wave (1.5\u20132.5 Hz) and polyspike-wave. Brain MRI to identify structural etiologies (hypoxic, dysgenic lesions) in ~30 % of cases. Genetic testing for copy number variants and syndromic associations.","management_principles":"Valproic acid is first-line (Class II, Level B evidence). Adjunctive agents include clobazam (Class III) and rufinamide (Class I), which reduce seizure frequency by 30\u201350 %. Felbamate is reserved for refractory cases due to risk of aplastic anemia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor valproate serum levels (target 50\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), hepatic transaminases, and platelet counts every 3 months. Serial developmental and behavioral assessments every 6\u201312 months. EEG follow-up as clinically indicated.","clinical_pearls":"1) Slow spike-and-wave (<2.5 Hz) EEG is hallmark of LGS. 2) Valproate is cornerstone of therapy. 3) Multidrug regimens are typically required. 4) Early institutional support optimizes developmental outcomes. 5) Avoid carbamazepine and vigabatrin which may worsen seizures.","references":"4.

Eyelid myoclonia is the hallmark of Jeavon\u2019s syndrome, an idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome characterized by eyelid myoclonia, photosensitivity, and absences, distinct from childhood absence epilepsy. No other options were provided; therefore this single option is incorrect and does not match the described clinical scenario.","conceptual_foundation":"Absence seizures are brief generalized nonmotor seizures with impaired consciousness. They are classified under idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs) in the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2017 classification. Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) typically presents between ages 4 and 10 with 3 Hz generalized spike\u2013wave discharges on EEG, often with rare secondary generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures. Differential diagnoses include Jeavon\u2019s syndrome (eyelid myoclonia with absences), myoclonic absence seizures, and focal seizures with rapid secondary generalization. Embryologically, generalized circuits involve thalamocortical networks and reticular thalamic nucleus development.","pathophysiology":"Normal thalamocortical circuits mediate wake\u2013sleep rhythms. In absence epilepsy, T\u2010type calcium channel overactivity in thalamic relay neurons leads to 3 Hz spike\u2010wave oscillations. GABAergic reticular nucleus neurons drive synchronous oscillations across cortex and thalamus, causing transient impaired consciousness. Eyelid myoclonia involves additional cortical hyperexcitability in peri\u2010rolandic regions, which is not present in CAE. Genetic mutations (e.g., in CACNA1H) predispose to IGE via altered ion channel function.","clinical_manifestation":"CAE presents with brief (5\u201320 s) staring spells, subtle automatisms (lip smacking, eyelid flutter), abrupt recovery, frequent daily episodes. Rare generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures may occur, usually in adolescence or adulthood. No focal neurological deficits are present. Eyelid myoclonia, photosensitivity, and prolonged motor jerks are not features of CAE but of Jeavon\u2019s syndrome.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010line EEG shows 3 Hz generalized spike\u2010wave discharges triggered by hyperventilation (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). Brain MRI is normal. Laboratory and metabolic panels are unremarkable. No antibody or structural imaging findings are expected.

Valproate is effective (seizure freedom ~80%) but has teratogenic risks. Lamotrigine is an alternative (seizure freedom ~50%) with favorable cognitive profile. Dosing: ethosuximide 20 mg/kg/day, valproate 20\u201330 mg/kg/day. Avoid narrow\u2010spectrum AEDs and those that worsen generalized epilepsy (e.g., carbamazepine).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor seizure frequency and EEG every 6\u201312 months.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Occipital seizure"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Occipital seizure","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Occipital seizure. Seizures precipitated by visual stimuli or motion (e.g., train travel) with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and posterior EEG discharges localize to the occipital lobe. Other seizure types do not exhibit photic- or motion-induced onset with posterior spikes. The history of events exclusively on the train with motion sensitivity points to reflex occipital epilepsy, and EEG posterior spike-wave discharges confirm occipital focus.","conceptual_foundation":"Reflex epilepsies are a subset of focal epilepsies triggered by specific stimuli. In occipital epilepsy, triggers include visual patterns, flicker, or motion. The ILAE classification of epilepsy (2017) lists reflex (sensory) epilepsies as focal with specific precipitants. Differential includes vestibular epilepsy, migraine with aura, and cyclic vomiting syndrome. Occipital seizures often manifest with visual phenomena (flashing lights), autonomic symptoms, and secondary generalization.","pathophysiology":"Hyperexcitable neuronal networks in the occipital cortex are triggered by visual or motion stimuli, leading to synchronous discharges. In reflex occipital epilepsy, cortical hyperexcitability lowers the threshold for seizure initiation in response to patterned visual or vestibular inputs. Underlying mechanisms include altered GABAergic inhibition and increased glutamatergic excitation in the visual cortex.","clinical_manifestation":"Occipital seizures present with visual aura (flashes, colored shapes), nausea or vomiting (autonomic involvement), and may progress to tonic-clonic activity. In reflex types, seizures occur predictably with triggers (motion, flicker). In children, posterior discharges on EEG during wakefulness and photic stimulation are characteristic.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis involves an ictal or interictal EEG demonstrating occipital spikes or spike-waves, often enhanced by photic stimulation or eye closure. Video-EEG during exposure to triggers (e.g., visual patterns) can capture seizures. MRI of the brain is indicated to exclude structural lesions.","management_principles":"First-line treatment is broad-spectrum antiseizure medications such as valproate, levetiracetam, or lamotrigine. In reflex occipital epilepsy, valproate shows efficacy in reducing photic-induced and motion-induced seizures. Lifestyle modification includes avoidance of triggers, use of polarized sunglasses, and minimizing exposure to flicker.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor seizure frequency and side effects with clinic visits every 3\u20136 months. Repeat EEG annually or if seizure control changes. Assess for medication adherence and trigger avoidance. Long-term prognosis is favorable with adequate trigger management and medication.","clinical_pearls":"1. Reflex occipital epilepsy manifests with visual aura and autonomic features. 2. Motion (train travel) can serve as a trigger similar to photic stimuli. 3. Posterior EEG discharges confirm occipital focus. 4. Broad-spectrum antiseizure drugs and trigger avoidance are key. 5.

Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives induce UGT1A4 activity, increasing lamotrigine clearance by up to 50%. To maintain therapeutic levels and prevent breakthrough seizures, the lamotrigine dose often needs to be increased (sometimes doubled) when initiating combined OCPs. Other options (not provided) such as halving the dose or no change would risk loss of seizure control.","conceptual_foundation":"Lamotrigine is metabolized primarily by glucuronidation via UGT1A4. Estrogens induce UGT enzymes, enhancing lamotrigine clearance. Effective contraception is important in women with epilepsy on teratogenic drugs, but interactions must be managed. Guidelines classify this as a pharmacokinetic drug\u2013drug interaction.","pathophysiology":"Increased UGT1A4 activity accelerates lamotrigine glucuronidation, reducing plasma half-life from ~25 to ~13 hours, lowering steady-state concentrations. Reduced lamotrigine leads to decreased sodium channel blockade, risking seizure breakthrough.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients may experience increased seizure frequency or severity after starting OCPs if lamotrigine levels fall. No direct systemic symptoms except seizure recurrence.","diagnostic_approach":"Serum lamotrigine levels should be measured before and 2\u20134 weeks after OCP initiation. A target therapeutic range of 2.5\u201315 \u00b5g/mL guides dosing adjustments.","management_principles":"Increase lamotrigine dose by 25\u201350% upon OCP initiation, with further titration guided by levels and clinical response. Upon discontinuation of OCPs, doses may need reduction to avoid toxicity. Regular monitoring of rash risk is necessary during dose escalation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Recheck lamotrigine levels 4 weeks after dose adjustment. Monitor seizure frequency and adverse effects every 3 months. Educate patient on signs of lamotrigine toxicity (ataxia, dizziness, rash).","clinical_pearls":"1. Estrogen-based OCPs induce lamotrigine clearance; adjust dose upward. 2. Progestin-only pills have minimal effect on UGT1A4. 3. Monitor levels before and after starting/stopping OCPs. 4. Rapid dose increases risk Stevens-Johnson syndrome; titrate slowly. 5. Always counsel on teratogenic risk and folate supplementation.","references":"1.

Hallucinations (often visual) followed by headache are characteristic of occipital lobe seizures, which can produce ictal visual hallucinations and postictal headache. Migraine with aura can mimic visual hallucinations but typically features negative or scintillating scotomas rather than formed images, and headache follows an aura rather than a seizure. Temporal lobe seizures produce complex visual phenomena less often and are accompanied by automatisms rather than headache.","conceptual_foundation":"Occipital epilepsy involves hyperexcitable neuronal networks in the visual cortex. ILAE classifies it among focal epilepsies. Visual hallucinations can be elementary (flashes, dots) or complex (formed images). The postictal headache (\u201cictal epileptic headache\u201d) can mimic migraine. Differential includes migraine with aura, Charles Bonnet syndrome, and visual release phenomena.","pathophysiology":"Seizure activity in occipital cortex causes aberrant firing of visual neurons, resulting in positive visual phenomena. Postictal headache may result from cortical spreading depression triggered by excessive neuronal activity. GABAergic interneuron dysfunction and elevated extracellular glutamate in visual areas contribute to seizure initiation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report brief visual hallucinations lasting seconds to minutes, often colored lights or shapes, followed by headache. Seizures may secondarily generalize. Episodes are stereotyped. Postictal confusion or headache can last hours, sometimes resembling migraine.","diagnostic_approach":"EEG captures occipital spikes or spike-and-wave discharges, particularly in awake or triggered by photic stimulation. MRI is indicated to exclude structural lesions (e.g., cortical dysplasia, tumors). Visual evoked potentials may show transient abnormalities during interictal period.","management_principles":"Treatment includes antiseizure medications effective for focal seizures, such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, or carbamazepine. Avoidance of triggers (photic, sleep deprivation) helps. In refractory cases, surgical resection of discrete occipital foci may be considered.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up every 3\u20136 months with EEG as indicated by changes in seizure pattern.
