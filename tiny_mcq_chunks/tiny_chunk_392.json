[{"question_number":"5","question":"A young female presents with a right arm focal clonic seizure lasting for 1 hour, triggered by stress, and has been on 4 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with normal prolonged video electroencephalogram (EEG) results. What finding supports the diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures?","options":["Persistent eye opening","Tongue biting","Absence of aura","Postictal confusion"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Persistent eye opening","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"Option Analysis":"Option A: Persistent eye opening\u2014This finding is highly suggestive of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). During epileptic events, involuntary eyelid opening typically accompanies ictal cortical discharges and the patient cannot actively maintain wide eyelid separation for prolonged periods. In PNES, voluntary control remains intact, allowing sustained or resisted eye opening throughout an apparent convulsion. Option B: Tongue biting\u2014True epileptic seizures classically produce lateral tongue injuries due to masseter clonus, whereas PNES may result in superficial or midline bites but not deep lateral lacerations. The presence of lateral tongue bite strongly favors an epileptic seizure and thus argues against PNES. Option C: Absence of aura\u2014An aura reflects a focal cortical onset and subjective sensory or psychic phenomenon preceding a convulsion. Its absence does not differentiate psychogenic from epileptic events, as many epilepsies lack auras and some PNES episodes simulate aura-like sensations. Option D: Postictal confusion\u2014Clinically, postictal cognitive impairment and somnolence occur in true epileptic seizures due to transient cortical inhibition. A clear postictal phase essentially excludes PNES. Therefore, persistent eye opening (Option A) best supports the PNES diagnosis.","Conceptual Foundation":"The voluntary control of eyelid aperture resides in the orbicularis oculi and levator palpebrae superioris muscles, innervated by the facial (VII) and oculomotor (III) cranial nerves, respectively. In an epileptic seizure, synchronous cortical discharges from motor areas propagate through corticobulbar tracts, causing involuntary eyelid opening or closure without volitional modulation. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures lack such ictal cortical bursts; motor phenomena arise from subcortical pattern generators in the reticular formation and emotional centers within the limbic system. The intact corticobulbar pathways allow patients to override or sustain eyelid position voluntarily. PNES frequently co-exists with conversion disorder and is mediated by abnormal interactions between prefrontal regulatory circuits and limbic drive. Recognizing these pathways helps distinguish somatoform movement from true epileptic activity during prolonged events.","Pathophysiology":"Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures represent functional neurological symptom disorder, with no overt structural or electrophysiological cortical pathology. At the molecular level, stress-related upregulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone in the amygdala modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneuron activity, altering inhibitory tone in prefrontal networks. Functional imaging shows abnormal connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area, reflecting impaired top-down control. Genetic predisposition contributes via polymorphisms in serotonin transporter genes, exacerbating limbic hyperreactivity. Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 may be elevated in conversion disorders, further dysregulating neurotransmission. Unlike epilepsy, PNES episodes lack paroxysmal neuronal hyperexcitability; instead, they mirror dissociative states with altered consciousness mediated by frontolimbic disconnection. Understanding these pathways underscores why routine prolonged EEG remains normal despite dramatic motor manifestations.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients with PNES often present with prolonged attack durations\u2014sometimes exceeding minutes to hours\u2014without electrographic correlates. Seizure-like activity may begin focally or globally, with side-to-side head shaking, asynchronous limb movements, pelvic thrusting, and vocalizations that lack epileptiform rhythmicity. Eye closure or persistent forced eye opening differentiates PNES from generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Autonomic signs such as tachycardia or diaphoresis may be present but fluctuate with emotional stressors. Consciousness may fluctuate, yet patients can often recall details, unlike postictal amnesia in true epilepsy. Prognosis correlates with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, duration of untreated PNES, and patient insight. Lack of response to multiple antiepileptic drugs, normal interictal and ictal EEG findings, and identifiable psychosocial triggers further define the presentation and guide expectations for recovery.","Diagnostic Approach":"The diagnostic algorithm for suspected PNES begins with a thorough history and video-EEG monitoring under medication tapering. Prolonged video-EEG provides simultaneous behavioral and electrophysiological data. Normal EEG activity during typical events confirms PNES. Provocative techniques, including suggestion or placebo, may elicit non-epileptic events safely. MRI and laboratory workup rule out structural lesions or metabolic derangements. Autonomic measures, such as heart rate variability, can show nonspecific fluctuations. Differential diagnoses include syncope, movement disorders (e.g., chorea), and catatonia; each presents unique clinical and electrophysiological signatures. Incorporating psychiatric assessment for conversion disorder, post-traumatic stress, and somatoform comorbidities completes the diagnostic picture. Early identification prevents unnecessary AED exposure and prompts appropriate psychotherapeutic interventions.","Management Principles":"Treatment of PNES centers on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic psychotherapy rather than antiepileptic drugs. Effective CBT protocols involve 12\u201316 weekly sessions focusing on stress management, emotional regulation, and healthy coping strategies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as sertraline 50\u2013150 mg daily may address comorbid depression or anxiety, but AEDs should be tapered gradually under neurologic supervision to avoid withdrawal seizures. Contraindications include abrupt AED discontinuation without monitoring or confrontation of symptom validity. Occupational therapy and relaxation training benefit functional outcomes. Family education and systemic therapy address psychosocial stressors. Multidisciplinary follow-up at 3-month intervals tracks seizure frequency, psychiatric status, and medication adjustments. Early referral to specialized functional neurologic disorders clinics improves long-term outcomes.","Follow-up Guidelines":"After PNES diagnosis, patients require close outpatient follow-up every 4\u201312 weeks during the first year. Monitoring includes seizure diaries, mood assessments using standardized scales (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory), and evaluation of social functioning. Long-term complications may involve chronic disability, iatrogenic harms from AED polytherapy, and psychiatric comorbidities such as conversion disorder or borderline personality traits. Patient education emphasizes the functional nature of events, encourages adherence to psychotherapy, and avoids reinforcement of the sick role. Gradual AED tapering protocols should be documented, with occasional inpatient video-EEG to confirm ongoing PNES if seizures persist. Early detection of new organic epilepsy or mixed seizure disorders ensures timely intervention.","Clinical Pearls":"1. Sustained voluntary eye opening or resistance to forced eye closure during convulsive spells is highly specific for PNES. 2. Lateral tongue bites and postictal confusion virtually exclude PNES. 3. Asynchronous, variable-amplitude movements and preserved social responsiveness point to psychogenic etiology. 4. Early video-EEG referral reduces misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatments. 5. CBT is first-line; AEDs are not indicated unless comorbid epilepsy is confirmed. 6. Avoid confrontational language; use collaborative explanations to enhance patient engagement. 7. Recent AAN guidelines emphasize structured psychotherapeutic interventions and caution against routine AED polypharmacy in PNES.","References":"1. Benbadis SR, et al.

Which of the following will carry the highest risk of recurrence?","options":["Abruptly stopping carbamazepine"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Abruptly stopping carbamazepine","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is the correct answer. Abrupt discontinuation of carbamazepine removes the stabilizing effect on voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to rebound hyperexcitability of cortical neurons and a high rate of seizure recurrence. Multiple observational studies report recurrence rates as high as 60\u201370% within six months after abrupt AED withdrawal compared with 15\u201320% with gradual tapering (Brodie et al. 1995; Shih et al. 1998). The American Epilepsy Society consensus statement (2018) explicitly advises against abrupt cessation of antiepileptic drugs, recommending a taper over at least 1\u20133 months (Class II evidence, Level B recommendation). No other options were provided for comparison, underscoring that abrupt withdrawal alone carries the highest documented risk of recurrence.","conceptual_foundation":"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by a chronic predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. According to the ILAE 2017 practical definition, epilepsy requires at least two unprovoked seizures separated by 24 hours or one unprovoked seizure with a high risk of recurrence. Carbamazepine is a first-line sodium-channel\u2013blocking AED indicated for focal seizures and generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures. Its mechanism involves prolongation of the inactivated state of sodium channels, reducing high-frequency neuronal firing. Long-term seizure freedom on AED therapy prompts consideration of drug withdrawal, but discontinuation must balance the risks of recurrence against adverse effects and patient quality of life. Factors reducing recurrence risk include seizure freedom for at least two years, normal EEG, and a single seizure type without structural lesion.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, voltage-gated sodium channels cycle rapidly between resting, activated, and inactivated states during action potential generation. Carbamazepine binds preferentially to the inactivated state, slowing channel recovery and limiting repetitive neuronal firing. Abrupt cessation results in sudden removal of sodium-channel blockade, leading to increased neuronal membrane excitability, synchronization, and risk of seizure propagation. On a molecular level, the sudden change disrupts homeostatic regulation of ion channel expression and may provoke kindling phenomena, whereby previously subthreshold excitatory inputs trigger full seizures. Chronic therapy downregulates excitatory NMDA receptor subunits; abrupt withdrawal may cause transient receptor upregulation and excitotoxicity, further predisposing to recurrence.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients who abruptly stop carbamazepine typically experience seizure relapse within days to weeks. Seizures often present as focal onset with or without secondary generalization, mirroring the patient\u2019s original epilepsy syndrome. Clinical features include sudden loss of responsiveness, automatisms, or tonic\u2013clonic movements, depending on cortical focus. Prodromal auras may reappear, and status epilepticus has been reported in 5\u201310% of cases following abrupt withdrawal. Risk factors for more severe recurrence include longer duration of epilepsy prior to remission, abnormal neuroimaging, and epileptiform discharges on EEG at the time of withdrawal.","diagnostic_approach":"When evaluating seizure recurrence after AED alteration, first-tier investigations include a detailed history of medication adherence, timing of last dose, and seizure semiology. Serum carbamazepine levels help confirm recent ingestion; levels <4 \u00b5g/mL in a previously stable patient suggest nonadherence or abrupt stoppage. A routine EEG may reveal epileptiform discharges, raising post-test probability of seizure recurrence. Neuroimaging with MRI is indicated if new focal deficits arise or if structural lesion is suspected. Second-tier tests\u2014such as video-EEG monitoring\u2014are reserved for unclear cases or to characterize seizure types before adjusting therapy.","management_principles":"The cornerstone of preventing recurrence is gradual tapering of carbamazepine over at least 1\u20133 months, reducing the daily dose by 10\u201325% every 2\u20134 weeks. This approach maintains steady-state pharmacokinetics and allows neurophysiological adaptation. If seizures recur, resumption of the patient\u2019s prior effective dose usually restores seizure control. Alternative AEDs may be considered for persistent side effects, with cross-titration to avoid gaps in coverage. Nonpharmacological measures\u2014such as ensuring regular sleep, stress management, and adherence reminders\u2014support pharmacotherapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur monthly during tapering to monitor for withdrawal seizures and adverse effects. Serum carbamazepine levels are checked at each visit, aiming for therapeutic range (4\u201312 \u00b5g/mL) until complete discontinuation. After stopping, quarterly follow-up for one year is recommended to detect late recurrences. EEG may be repeated if clinical suspicion arises. Patient education should include recognition of auras, first-aid measures for seizures, and instructions to resume therapy immediately if a seizure occurs.","clinical_pearls":"1. Abrupt AED withdrawal carries a >60% risk of seizure recurrence within six months; taper slowly over weeks. 2. Therapeutic serum levels of carbamazepine (4\u201312 \u00b5g/mL) confirm adherence before concluding taper failure. 3. Risk of status epilepticus increases with sudden discontinuation\u2014counsel patients accordingly. 4. Normal EEG and imaging predict lower recurrence\u2014consider longer seizure-free interval before taper. 5. Gradual tapering reduces kindling and excitotoxicity mechanisms underlying withdrawal seizures.","references":"1. Brodie MJ, Holmes GB. Withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs: a prospective study.

What supports the diagnosis?","options":["Persistent eye opening","Tongue biting","Absence of aura ## Page 26"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Absence of aura","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C (Absence of aura). In psychogenic non\u2010epileptic seizures (PNES), patients typically do not experience a subjective epileptic aura\u2014an ictal phenomenon reflecting cortical seizure onset\u2014that precedes motor manifestations. In contrast, auras are reported in up to 60% of focal epilepsies (Fisher et al. Neurology 2017;88(15):1463\u20131472). Option A (Persistent eye opening) and option B (Tongue biting) both favor an epileptic seizure: during generalized tonic-clonic seizures the eyes often remain open, and tongue biting\u2014particularly lateral tongue biting\u2014has a specificity of ~95% for epileptic seizures (Benbadis et al. Epilepsy Behav 2009;16(1):134\u2013139). The lack of aura, when combined with stress precipitants, long event duration, normal ictal EEG, and refractory AED use, supports PNES rather than focal epilepsy.","conceptual_foundation":"Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures are classified in DSM-5 under Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder with attacks or seizures (F44.5). They are a subtype of conversion disorders in ICD-11 (6B60.3). PNES falls under the broader category of functional neurological disorders characterized by neurological symptoms incompatible with recognized pathophysiology. Differential diagnoses include focal epileptic seizures, syncope, movement disorders, and paroxysmal dyskinesias. Historically, PNES were termed \u201chysterical seizures\u201d (Charcot, 19th century) and later \u201cpseudoseizures,\u201d but modern terminology emphasizes their genuine psychological origin without conscious feigning. Knowledge of cortical seizure propagation, motor system organization, and vagal autonomic pathways underlies the distinction between epileptic and non-epileptic attacks.","pathophysiology":"Normal cortical electrical activity involves synchronized neuronal discharges. In focal epilepsy, paroxysmal depolarizing shifts arise in a hyperexcitable cortical focus, leading to spread via glutamatergic networks. By contrast, PNES events are mediated by functional disturbances in brain networks involved in emotion regulation (insula, anterior cingulate) and motor control (supplementary motor area, basal ganglia) without ictal depolarization or structural lesion. Stress triggers abnormal activation of limbic circuitry and disinhibition of motor programs, resulting in semi\u2010voluntary movements. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate altered connectivity in PNES between prefrontal cortex and motor regions, as well as limbic\u2010pre-motor loops (Labate et al. Epilepsia 2012;53(1):116\u2013125).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PNES often present with long\u2010lasting (>2 minutes), fluctuating motor phenomena, asynchronous limb clonus, pelvic thrusting, side\u2010to\u2010side head movements, ictal diaphoresis without cyanosis, and lack of postictal confusion. Consciousness may appear impaired, but simple commands can sometimes be obeyed mid-event. In this case, a young female under stress with a 1-hour focal clonic event on multiple AEDs, repeated normal video-EEGs, and no aura fits PNES rather than true focal epilepsy. True focal motor seizures rarely last beyond a few minutes and typically are associated with a Jacksonian march or aura in up to 60% of cases.","diagnostic_approach":"Video-EEG monitoring is the gold standard: capture of a typical event with no ictal EEG correlate confirms PNES (AAN Level A evidence). First\u2010tier evaluation includes detailed history (stress triggers, event semiology), neurological examination between events, and outpatient EEG. If inconclusive, inpatient video-EEG is indicated. The sensitivity of capturing a typical PNES on prolonged monitoring is ~85%, with specificity near 100% when combined with expert review (LaFrance et al. Epilepsy Behav 2013;29(1):14\u201321). Ancillary tests such as serum prolactin levels postictal have limited utility (sensitivity ~50\u201360%).","management_principles":"Management centers on clear communication of diagnosis, withdrawal of unnecessary AEDs, and referral for psychotherapy\u2014principally cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). A randomized trial showed that CBT reduced monthly event frequency by 50% at six months versus controls (Goldstein et al. Lancet Psychiatry 2019;6(5):365\u2013374). Treatment of comorbid conditions (anxiety, depression) with SSRIs (e.g., sertraline 50\u2013200 mg/day) can be beneficial. Neurology involvement continues during AED tapering, monitoring for breakthrough epileptic seizures (<5% risk in PNES without true epilepsy). Multidisciplinary collaboration with psychiatry and psychology is critical.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up should occur monthly for the first three months post-diagnosis, then every three months for the first year. At each visit, assess event frequency, psychological stressors, AED side effects, and comorbid psychiatric symptoms using validated scales (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7). Long-term outcomes show 30\u201350% sustained remission at two years with combined CBT and education (Reuber et al. Neurology 2007;69(14):1478\u20131484). Relapse often correlates with life stressors\u2014early referral back to psychotherapy is advised.

Refer for surgical evaluation. According to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2019 guidelines and American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2020 practice parameters, patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and hippocampal sclerosis who have failed two adequately chosen and tolerated antiseizure medications (ASMs) are surgical candidates (Level A recommendation). Lacosamide has a recommended maximum dose of 400 mg/day; this patient is already at the upper limit (200 mg BID), and further increases risk adverse events without evidence of additional efficacy (Brodie et al., 2010; French et al., 2015). Adding carbamazepine (option B) or valproic acid (option C) constitutes a third ASM trial; per ILAE definitions, failure of two ASMs defines drug\u2010resistant epilepsy and indicates referral for surgical evaluation rather than additional polytherapy, which yields diminishing returns (Kwan and Brodie, 2000). Option A, increasing lacosamide, is neither supported by dose\u2010response data nor by safety; randomized trials show no significant seizure improvement above 400 mg/day and increased dizziness and diplopia (Hal\u00e1sz et al., 2016). Thus, option D is the evidence\u2010based optimal step.","conceptual_foundation":"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a focal epilepsy syndrome characterized by seizures arising from the hippocampus and parahippocampal structures. In the current ILAE classification (2017), MTLE falls under 'Focal epilepsies due to structural/metabolic causes' (8A60.0). The prototypical pathology is hippocampal sclerosis\u2014neuronal loss in CA1 and CA4 with gliosis\u2014first described by Sommer (1880). Differential diagnoses include neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy, extratemporal focal epilepsy, and psychogenic non\u2010epileptic seizures. Historically, the understanding of MTLE evolved from the mid\u201020th century\u2019s electroclinical correlations (Penfield and Jasper, 1954) to modern MRI and histopathology definitions (Bl\u00fcmcke et al., 2013). Embryologically, the hippocampus derives from the medial pallium; disruptions in neuronal migration, connectivity, or early insults (e.g., febrile status epilepticus) predispose to sclerosis. Neuroanatomically, the hippocampus receives perforant path input from the entorhinal cortex, with output via the fornix to the mammillary bodies, forming the Papez circuit. In MTLE, aberrant mossy fiber sprouting in CA3 and excitatory recurrent circuits facilitate seizure generation. \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneuron loss and altered glutamate receptor subunit expression (NMDA NR2A/NR2B) contribute to hyperexcitability. Blood supply is primarily from hippocampal branches of the posterior cerebral artery. Genetic predispositions include variants in KCNQ2, SCN1A, and DEPDC5 in familial MTLE, although most cases are sporadic. This nosological and biological foundation underlies the clinical approach to refractory MTLE and supports surgical intervention when structural lesions and concordant EEG findings are present.","pathophysiology":"Normal hippocampal physiology involves tightly regulated excitatory\u2013inhibitory balance. Glutamatergic pyramidal cells in CA1\u2013CA3 are modulated by GABAergic interneurons; mossy fiber inputs from dentate granule cells exhibit strong feed\u2010forward inhibition. In hippocampal sclerosis, selective loss of inhibitory interneurons (particularly parvalbumin-positive basket cells) and excitatory pyramidal cells leads to synaptic reorganization: aberrant mossy fiber sprouting into the inner molecular layer creates recurrent excitatory circuits (Tauck and Nadler, 1985). Molecular changes include upregulation of glutamate receptor subunits (NR2B), downregulation of GABA_A receptor subunits (\u03b11), altered expression of sodium channel subunits (SCN1A downregulation), and increased proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) driving gliosis. This network hyperexcitability manifests as spontaneous recurrent seizures. Temporal lobe status epilepticus or febrile seizures in childhood trigger excitotoxic neuronal death via NMDA receptor overactivation, ROS production, and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to chronic epileptogenesis over years. Compensatory sprouting initially aims to maintain synaptic input but decompensates into pathological circuit formation. Compared to neocortical epilepsy, MTLE demonstrates more pronounced hippocampal atrophy on MRI, correlating with neuropsychological deficits in memory. Whereas systemic ASM therapy targets ion channels (e.g., sodium channel block by lacosamide) to reduce excitability, it does not reverse structural network reorganization. Surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone disrupts aberrant circuits, addressing the structural etiology directly.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with MTLE typically present in adolescence or early adulthood (mean age 18\u201325 years), often with a history of childhood febrile seizures. The cardinal seizure semiology includes an epigastric rising aura (sensation of nausea or panic), autonomic signs (tachycardia, pallor), d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or jamais vu, followed by impaired awareness and oroalimentary or manual automatisms (lip smacking, hand rubbing). Motor manifestations can include dystonic posturing of the contralateral arm. Seizures typically last 60\u201390 seconds, followed by postictal confusion and amnesia. Approximately 60\u201370% have hippocampal sclerosis on imaging; 30% have normal MRI but concordant EEG/MRI-PET. Uncontrolled MTLE progresses to cluster seizures, secondary generalization in 30\u201340% of cases, and can lead to SUDEP (mortality risk ~1.2/1000 patient-years). Special populations: pediatric cases can present with focal seizures evolving to bilateral convulsions; elderly patients may report atypical cognitive changes. Natural history without surgery: chronic active epilepsy with incremental neurocognitive decline, memory deficits (~70%), and diminished quality of life. Formal diagnostic criteria per ILAE require two unprovoked focal impaired-awareness seizures with evidence of hippocampal pathology on MRI or EEG onset in mesial temporal electrodes, sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%. Controversies include the definition of drug resistance and timing of surgical referral.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic evaluation begins with a detailed history and neurologic exam, focusing on aura description, seizure semiology, and risk factors. First-tier investigations: 3T MRI with epilepsy protocol (T2-weighted coronal hippocampal images), interictal EEG. MRI has sensitivity 85% and specificity 90% for hippocampal sclerosis. EEG reveals interictal spikes or sharp waves in anterior temporal leads (sensitivity 60\u201380%, specificity 75\u201390%). Second-tier: video-EEG telemetry to capture ictal events; ictal onset in mesial temporal electrodes confirms localization (positive predictive value ~95%). Neuropsychological testing assesses lateralizing memory deficits (e.g., verbal memory for left MTLE). Third-tier: FDG-PET shows ipsilateral temporal hypometabolism (sensitivity 80\u201385%), ictal SPECT with SISCOM enhances localization (localization accuracy ~90%), and Wada test for language and memory lateralization (predictive of postoperative cognitive outcome). Preoperative evaluation includes high-resolution MRI, prolonged video-EEG, PET/SPECT, neuropsychology, and psychiatric assessment. Invasive monitoring (depth electrodes or subdural grids) is reserved for discordant noninvasive data. These modalities are guided by pretest probability: in classic MTLE with concordant MRI and video EEG, invasive monitoring is often unnecessary. Resource-limited settings may rely on MRI and surface EEG alone.","management_principles":"Per ILAE and AAN 2020 guidelines, drug-resistant epilepsy is defined as failure of two tolerated, appropriately chosen and used ASM schedules (alone or in combination). This patient has failed lamotrigine and lacosamide at optimal dose. ASM polytherapy beyond two drugs yields <5% additional seizure freedom and increased adverse effects (Brooks-Kayal et al., 2019). First-tier pharmacotherapy for MTLE includes carbamazepine or lamotrigine (Level A), with response rates of 60\u201370% incomplete. Lacosamide is Level B for focal seizures but less effective as monotherapy in MTLE than surgical cure. Second-tier drugs (levetiracetam, topiramate) have lower evidence. Given structural lesion, surgical resection (anterior temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalohippocampectomy) achieves seizure freedom in 60\u201380% at one year (Wiebe et al., 2001; Engel, 2013) with low morbidity. Class I randomized trial (Wiebe et al., 2001) demonstrated 64% seizure freedom at one year post-surgery vs. 8% with continued medical therapy (hazard ratio 4.8; p<0.001). Thus, referral for surgical evaluation is recommended after two ASM failures. Preoperative counseling addresses cognitive risks; selective amygdalohippocampectomy may spare neocortical function. Non-pharmacological adjuncts (ketogenic diet, VNS) have lower efficacy (~30% responder rate) and are reserved for non-surgical candidates. Emerging therapies include laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) with seizure freedom ~60%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-surgical follow-up includes clinical visits at 3, 6, and 12 months, then annually. MRI at 6\u201312 months to assess for residual lesion. EEG at 12 months monitors for interictal spikes. ASM weaning may begin after two years of seizure freedom in patients with complete resection and concordant preoperative data, reducing dose by 10% every 3\u20136 months under EEG surveillance. Neuropsychological assessment at 12 months evaluates cognitive trajectories; improvements in quality of life measures (QOLIE-31) are expected. SUDEP risk declines by ~80% post-surgery. For non-surgical candidates, follow-up every 6 months for medication adjustments; VNS monitoring includes parameter titration q 4\u20136 weeks. Long-term care addresses psychosocial support and driving privileges per regional regulations. Rehabilitation includes memory training for residual deficits; multidisciplinary teams optimize functional outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined after failure of two appropriate ASMs; do not pursue indefinite polytherapy (high\u2010yield for board exams; ILAE definition). 2. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis has the highest seizure\u2010freedom rate with anterior temporal lobectomy (~70%)\u2014consider surgery early. 3. The epigastric rising aura with automatisms localizes to the mesial temporal structures; detailed semiology improves surgical planning. 4. MRI epilepsy protocol (thin coronal T2) is critical; failure to image with proper cuts can miss hippocampal sclerosis. 5. Wada test guides risk of postoperative memory decline; selective approaches (SAH vs ATL) can minimize cognitive morbidity.","references":"1. Kwan P, Brodie MJ.

What will carry the highest risk of recurrence?","options":["Family history of epilepsy","History of febrile seizures ## Page 27"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Family history of epilepsy","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. Family history of epilepsy. Multiple cohort studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that a positive first-degree family history of epilepsy is associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of seizure recurrence after a first unprovoked seizure (Hauser et al. Neurology 1998;50:1543\u20131550; Berg AT. JAMA 2004;292:1682\u20131683). The 2007 AAN practice parameter on the evaluation of a first seizure in adults (Krumholz et al. Neurology 2007;69:1996\u20132007) lists family history as a Grade B risk factor for recurrence, with an estimated two-year recurrence rate of approximately 60% in those with positive family history versus 40% in those without. Option B (history of febrile seizures) is incorrect: remote febrile seizures alone do not significantly increase the immediate risk of recurrence after a first unprovoked adult seizure (Camfield & Camfield. Neurology 2002;58:1672\u20131675), with odds ratio close to 1.1 (95% CI 0.8\u20131.4) and low attributable risk. A common misconception is conflating the long-term risk of epilepsy development after febrile seizures with the acute recurrence risk after a first unprovoked seizure.","conceptual_foundation":"A new-onset seizure is defined as a single unprovoked event occurring without an acute precipitant such as metabolic derangement or CNS infection (ILAE 2017 classification). The distinction between provoked and unprovoked seizures is central: unprovoked seizures carry a baseline two-year recurrence risk of ~40\u201350%, rising to ~85% with remote symptomatic etiologies. Family history of epilepsy reflects genetic predisposition and idiopathic or genetic generalized epilepsies, classified under ILAE 2017 as genetic generalized epilepsies (G40.3 per ICD-11). Differential considerations for a first seizure include structural lesions, metabolic disturbances, immune-mediated causes, and acute symptomatic causes. Historically, the term \u201cidiopathic\u201d has evolved to \u201cgenetic,\u201d reflecting advances in molecular genetics identifying channelopathies (e.g., SCN1A mutations in generalized epilepsies). Embryologically, genetic epilepsies often involve ion-channel development in cortical neurons. Neuroanatomically, a family history suggests widespread cortical hyperexcitability rather than focal structural lesions; GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways are implicated. This conceptual framework underpins risk stratification after a first seizure.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuronal excitability is maintained by a balance between inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic transmission. Genetic predisposition (family history) often involves channelopathies (e.g., voltage-gated sodium channel mutations) leading to aberrant neuronal firing and network synchronization. In first unprovoked seizures, genetic factors prime cortical networks, lowering the seizure threshold. Recurrent seizures result from maladaptive changes: GABA_A receptor downregulation, NMDA receptor upregulation, synaptic reorganization, and gliosis. In contrast, history of febrile seizures primarily reflects early childhood hyperthermia-induced network changes without enduring channelopathies in most. The molecular cascade in genetic epilepsies involves altered ion conductance, calcium homeostasis, and second-messenger systems, promoting recurrent discharges. Chronic compensatory mechanisms (e.g., receptor trafficking) fail over time, leading to decompensation and increased seizure recurrence risk.","clinical_manifestation":"First unprovoked seizures typically manifest as generalized tonic-clonic events (50\u201360%), focal seizures with impaired awareness (20\u201330%), or focal aware seizures (10\u201315%). Prodromal symptoms (aura, transient focal deficits) occur in 25\u201330%. In patients with positive family history, the clinical presentation often aligns with generalized epilepsies (e.g., absence, myoclonic jerks), though a generalized tonic-clonic seizure may be the first manifestation. Febrile seizures in childhood rarely present in adulthood as recurrent unprovoked seizures; incidence of recurrence after a first adult seizure in those with febrile seizure history approximates general population rates (~40% at two years). Untreated, patients with family history have a two-year recurrence risk of ~60%, with critical window for recurrence within the first six months.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach begins with detailed history and examination, followed by first-tier tests: EEG and brain MRI with epilepsy protocol. EEG demonstrates epileptiform discharges in 30\u201350% after a first seizure; sensitivity improves to 70% with sleep-deprived EEG (AAN Grade B). MRI yields lesions in ~20% of idiopathic cases but <5% in genetic generalized epilepsies. Second-tier tests include metabolic panels, autoimmune panels (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor antibodies) when clinical suspicion is high. Pretest probability of recurrence rises with positive family history (post-test probability ~65% at two years). In resource-limited settings, a routine CT head may suffice, though sensitivity for subtle cortical dysplasias is only ~60%.","management_principles":"Initiation of antiseizure medication after a first unprovoked seizure is recommended when the two-year recurrence risk exceeds 60% (ILAE 2013 guidelines; French et al. Neurology 2017). A positive family history elevates risk above this threshold, justifying treatment. First-line agents for genetic generalized epilepsies include valproate (Class I evidence, seizure freedom in ~60%), lamotrigine (Class II, ~50%), and levetiracetam (Class III, ~45%). Dose titration, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effect profiles guide selection. Second-tier treatments (e.g., topiramate, zonisamide) are considered when first-line agents are contraindicated or poorly tolerated. Non-pharmacologic options (e.g., ketogenic diet, VNS) are reserved for refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients started on medication after first seizure require follow-up at 1 month, 3 months, and then every 6 months for the first two years. EEG may be repeated at 6\u201312 months to assess for emergent epileptiform activity. MRI need not be repeated unless new focal deficits arise. Functional assessments include quality-of-life scales (QOLIE-31) at annual visits. Duration of therapy is usually \u22652 years seizure-free before considering withdrawal. Relapse risk after withdrawal in genetic epilepsies is ~40%.","clinical_pearls":"1. A positive first-degree family history doubles recurrence risk after a first unprovoked seizure \u2013 consider early treatment. 2. Normal neurological exam and imaging with no family history confer lowest recurrence risk (~30% at two years). 3. EEG epileptiform discharges increase recurrence risk by 1.8-fold \u2013 order sleep-deprived EEG if initial EEG is normal. 4. Febrile seizure history alone does not significantly alter adult recurrence risk \u2013 avoid overtreatment. 5. Aim for two years seizure-free before contemplating antiseizure withdrawal; relapse rates are higher in genetic epilepsies.","references":"1. Fisher RS, van Emde Boas W, Blume W, et al.
