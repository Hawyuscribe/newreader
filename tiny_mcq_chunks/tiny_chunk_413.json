[{"question_number":"4","question":"An elderly male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease presented with an episode of loss of consciousness preceded by sweating and palpitations. The episode lasted a few seconds, and he immediately regained full baseline. His heart rate was borderline low at 50 beats per minute. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Typical syncope","Rhythmic jerking","Epileptic seizure","Oral automatism"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Typical syncope","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Typical syncope. The patient\u2019s brief transient loss of consciousness preceded by diaphoresis and palpitations, immediate recovery without confusion or postictal state, and borderline bradycardia are classic for vasovagal or reflex syncope. Option B (Rhythmic jerking) is incorrect because while myoclonic jerks may occasionally accompany syncope, they are typically brief and not sustained rhythmic movements as seen in seizures; they do not define the diagnosis. Option C (Epileptic seizure) is unlikely given the absence of a prolonged postictal state, tongue biting, incontinence, or characteristic EEG findings; seizures usually last longer and frequently have confusing recovery. Option D (Oral automatism) is a feature of focal (temporal lobe) seizures, not syncope, and would not present with autonomic prodrome of sweating and palpitations alone without other focal neurological signs.","conceptual_foundation":"Syncope is defined as a transient loss of consciousness due to global cerebral hypoperfusion. It is categorized under transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) etiologies alongside seizures, psychogenic pseudosyncope, and other causes. Typical (vasovagal) syncope arises from a reflex mediated by autonomic imbalance: increased vagal tone and reduced sympathetic outflow leading to hypotension and/or bradycardia. Recognizing syncope requires understanding of cerebral autoregulation, baroreceptor reflexes, and cardiovascular physiology. Differential diagnoses include epileptic seizures (characterized by abnormal cortical discharges), arrhythmic syncope (primary cardiac conduction abnormalities), orthostatic hypotension (impaired autonomic or volume regulation), and structural cardiac disease.","pathophysiology":"In reflex syncope, triggers (emotional stress, pain, orthostatic stress) activate afferent signals via mechanoreceptors and baroreceptors to the brainstem nucleus tractus solitarius. The ensuing autonomic response involves paradoxical withdrawal of sympathetic tone and increase in parasympathetic activity, causing vasodilation and/or bradycardia. This leads to sudden reduction in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, resulting in global cerebral hypoperfusion and transient loss of consciousness. Compensation fails acutely, but as the patient becomes supine, venous return improves, cardiac output normalizes, and consciousness is rapidly regained.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often report prodromal symptoms: nausea, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and palpitations lasting seconds to a minute. The actual loss of consciousness typically lasts under 20 seconds. Movements may include brief myoclonic jerks, but there is no tonic\u2013clonic activity or tongue biting. Recovery is immediate and complete, with no confusion or focal deficits. Episodes frequently occur in the upright position or with identifiable triggers (pain, emotion, orthostasis). Physical exam between episodes is usually normal aside from occasional bradycardia or orthostatic hypotension.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes detailed history emphasizing prodrome, duration, and recovery, and a physical exam with orthostatic vital signs. Resting ECG is essential to exclude arrhythmias. If initial workup is nondiagnostic and vasovagal syncope is suspected, head-up tilt-table testing can reproduce symptoms by simulating orthostatic stress (sensitivity ~60\u201370%, specificity ~90%). Ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter or event recorder) is indicated if cardiac syncope is suspected. EEG is reserved for atypical cases with unclear phenomenology or neurological abnormalities.","management_principles":"Lifestyle modifications are first-line: increased hydration, salt intake, and avoidance of triggers. Physical counterpressure maneuvers (leg crossing, handgrip) improve venous return. Pharmacotherapy with fludrocortisone or midodrine may be considered in recurrent, refractory cases. Beta-blockers and SSRIs have limited evidence. Cardiac pacing is reserved for patients with predominant cardioinhibitory responses unresponsive to conservative measures.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should assess symptom recurrence, adherence to lifestyle measures, and orthostatic vital signs. Tilt-table testing may be repeated only if diagnosis remains uncertain. Long-term prognosis of vasovagal syncope is generally benign, with low mortality; however, recurrent episodes can impair quality of life. Education focuses on early recognition of prodrome and implementation of counterpressure techniques.","clinical_pearls":"1. Prodromal diaphoresis and palpitations point to reflex syncope rather than seizure. 2. Brief myoclonic jerks can occur in syncope but are not epileptic. 3. Rapid full recovery without confusion is hallmark of syncope. 4. Tilt-table testing confirms susceptibility to reflex syncope (high specificity). 5. Physical counterpressure maneuvers are effective first-line nonpharmacologic therapy.","references":"1.

After examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) are normal. What is the 2-year recurrence risk?","options":["10%","30%","50%","70%"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"30%","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B (30%) is the most accurate estimate of the 2-year recurrence risk after a first unprovoked generalized tonic-clonic seizure in a young adult with normal MRI and EEG. A pooled meta-analysis by Bonnett et al. (2018) reported a 2-year recurrence risk of 33% (95% CI 28\u201338%) in patients with no structural lesions and normal EEGs. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN 2016) guidelines cite a recurrence risk of approximately 30\u201340% when both imaging and EEG are normal (Level B evidence). Option A (10%) underestimates the risk; very low-risk profiles (normal imaging, normal EEG, no focal signs) still carry a recurrence risk closer to 20\u201330%, not as low as 10%. Option C (50%) overestimates the risk; higher recurrence rates (>50%) are seen in patients with epileptiform abnormalities on EEG or cortical dysplasia on MRI. Option D (70%) is far above the observed rates in unprovoked first seizures and is only seen in certain high-risk symptomatic cases (e.g., remote symptomatic epilepsy). Common misconceptions include assuming that a normal MRI/EEG implies near-zero risk, whereas data show a substantial residual risk around one-third over two years.","conceptual_foundation":"First unprovoked seizures are classified under ICD-11 code 8A60. Conceptually, an unprovoked seizure occurs without an immediate precipitating factor such as acute metabolic disturbance or withdrawal. The ILAE Nosology (2017) defines epilepsy as two unprovoked seizures >24 hours apart or one unprovoked seizure plus a recurrence risk \u226560%. Thus, by definition, a single first seizure with a recurrence risk <60% does not yet establish epilepsy. Differential diagnoses include syncope, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, and transient ischemic attacks. Historically, recurrence risk estimates have evolved from early single-center cohorts (recurrence ~50%) to large multicenter meta-analyses refining risk by EEG and imaging findings. Embryologically, generalized tonic-clonic seizures implicate diffuse cortical hyperexcitability, with thalamocortical circuits mature by adolescence. Neuroanatomically, generalized seizures recruit bilateral cortical networks via ascending thalamic projections. Genetic predispositions (e.g., variants in GABRA1 or SCN1A) can lower the threshold for seizure occurrence even in the absence of structural lesions. Understanding these foundational concepts allows one to interpret recurrence data in the context of individual risk factors.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuronal function balances excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic transmission. In a first unprovoked seizure, a transient shift towards excitation occurs\u2014whether due to subtle channelopathies, synaptic receptor alterations, or network hyperexcitability. Although MRI and EEG are normal, molecular-level changes (e.g., increased NMDA receptor expression or altered interneuron function) can persist. Over months, maladaptive synaptic plasticity (e.g., mossy fiber sprouting in the hippocampus) may increase seizure propensity. In contrast, patients with epileptiform EEG or hippocampal sclerosis exhibit more pronounced network reorganization and higher recurrence risks (>50%). The 30% recurrence rate thus reflects the intermediate pathophysiological state of a brain with latent hyperexcitability but without gross structural or interictal epileptiform abnormalities.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion characterized by abrupt LOC, tonic stiffening for 10\u201320 seconds, followed by clonic jerking for up to 2 minutes, and postictal confusion. Up to 70% of first seizures present as generalized tonic-clonic. Prodromal auras are rare in truly generalized onset seizures. In daytime events, bystander witnesses often provide a history of limb stiffening, rhythmic movements, cyanosis, and tongue biting\u2014distinguishing seizures from syncope. A normal neurological exam between seizures, as in this patient, reduces likelihood of structural epilepsy and lowers recurrence risk. In untreated first seizures, about 30% will have a second seizure within 2 years; about half of those recur within the first 6 months.","diagnostic_approach":"After a first unprovoked seizure, guidelines recommend brain MRI with epilepsy protocol (AAN 2016, Level B) and routine EEG within 24\u201348 hours (AAN 2016, Level B). MRI sensitivity for epileptogenic lesions is ~80% with dedicated protocols; routine EEG sensitivity for detecting interictal epileptiform discharges is ~50%, rising to ~70% with sleep-deprived studies. Pre-test probability of a symptomatic lesion is ~10% in normal exams; a negative MRI reduces post-test probability to <2%. First-tier labs include electrolytes, glucose, renal/hepatic function, and toxicology. Second-tier: autoantibody panels if autoimmune epilepsy suspected. Third-tier: prolonged video EEG monitoring reserved for unclear cases. In resource-limited settings, CT head may be acceptable if MRI unavailable, but CT sensitivity for mesial temporal sclerosis <30%.","management_principles":"The decision to start antiseizure medication (ASM) after a first seizure hinges on recurrence risk vs. treatment adverse effects. A recurrence risk \u226560% generally justifies therapy (ILAE 2013); at ~30% risk, guidelines recommend shared decision-making (AAN 2016, Class I evidence). First-line ASMs for generalized tonic-clonic seizures include valproate (broad spectrum, 60\u201370% 1-year seizure freedom, NNT \u22483) and lamotrigine (50\u201360% seizure freedom, NNT \u22484). Dosing: valproate 15\u201320 mg/kg/day, lamotrigine titrated over 5 weeks to 200 mg/day. Adverse effects: valproate (hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity), lamotrigine (rash, SJS <0.1%). For patients deferring ASM, education on safety (driving restrictions for 6 months) is critical.","follow_up_guidelines":"For patients not started on ASM, follow-up at 3 months to reassess for any interim events, counsel on lifestyle modifications (sleep hygiene, avoiding alcohol), and repeat EEG if new risk factors emerge. If ASM initiated, monitor serum drug levels at steady state (after 5 half-lives) and every 6\u201312 months thereafter. Liver function tests for valproate quarterly in the first year. Neuropsychological assessment may be warranted if cognitive complaints arise. Driving restrictions vary by jurisdiction but typically require seizure-free interval of 6\u201312 months. Long-term, about 70% of treated patients achieve remission; those with normal baseline workup have the best prognosis.","clinical_pearls":"1. A first unprovoked tonic-clonic seizure with normal MRI/EEG carries ~30% 2-year recurrence risk\u2014enough to consider but not mandate ASM.\n2. Normal MRI and EEG lower, but do not eliminate, the risk of a second seizure; residual network hyperexcitability persists at a molecular level.\n3. ILAE criteria define epilepsy as two unprovoked seizures or one plus \u226560% recurrence risk; this patient does not yet meet criteria if untreated.\n4. Shared decision-making is key after a first seizure with intermediate recurrence risk; discuss benefits (seizure reduction) vs. risks (drug side effects).\n5. Driving restrictions post-seizure aim to balance public safety with patient autonomy; typical seizure-free intervals range from 6 to 12 months depending on jurisdiction.","references":"1.

What is the localization?","options":["Right frontal lobe","Right temporal lobe","Left temporal lobe","Left frontal lobe ## Page 11"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Right temporal lobe","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Right temporal lobe. In focal seizures, automatisms such as lip smacking or manual automatisms are highly characteristic of mesial temporal lobe onset and typically occur ipsilateral to the seizure focus (Jasper and Penfield, 1954). Hand automatisms localize to the temporal lobe with reported ipsilateral lateralizing value up to 85% (Blume et al., 2001). In contrast, forced head turning (versive movement) is a frontal lobe sign that lateralizes to the hemisphere contralateral to the direction of turning (Ku A et al., 2001); however, here the head turning is described as early but non-focal, suggesting it lacks true versive character and is not the primary localizing sign. Thus, the persistent right hand automatisms, without a clear versive etiology, point to a right temporal focus. \n\nIncorrect Options:\nA. Right frontal lobe: While frontal lobe seizures can produce forced head turning contralateral to the focus, they rarely produce sustained unilateral automatisms without secondary temporal propagation. Studies show low specificity of automatisms for frontal lobe onset (Koutroumanidis et al., 2002).\nC. Left temporal lobe: Left temporal onset would produce left-sided automatisms rather than right hand automatisms in the vast majority of cases (Willmore et al., 1985).\nD. Left frontal lobe: Left frontal focus would drive head turning to the right, but would not produce right hand automatisms as an ipsilateral sign; frontal automatisms are often bilateral and non-lateralizing (Rosenow and L\u00fcders, 2001).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding lateralizing and localizing signs in focal epilepsies requires knowledge of motor homunculus, seizure semiology, and propagation patterns. Seizure activity arises from a hyperexcitable cortical focus and spreads via horizontal cortical connections and subcortical pathways (Trevelyan et al., 2006). The temporal lobe contains mesial structures (hippocampus, amygdala) prone to generating automatisms through limbic circuits (McIntosh et al., 2001). Motor signs such as automatisms involve basal ganglia loops and supplementary motor areas interconnected with medial temporal structures. Embryologically, the temporal lobe structures develop from the telencephalic vesicle, with layering that predisposes to synchronized discharges. Nosologically, focal epilepsies are classified under ICD-11 code 8A60. Epilepsy syndromes are grouped by seizure type, onset age, and EEG features in ILAE classifications (Fisher et al., 2017). The mesial temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome is characterized by hippocampal sclerosis and typical auras, automatism semiology, and temporal EEG discharges. Differential diagnoses include frontal lobe epilepsy, psychogenic nonepileptic events, and subcortical movement disorders.","pathophysiology":"Normal cortical physiology relies on balanced excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic signaling (Treiman, 2001). In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), hippocampal sclerosis leads to neuron loss, gliosis, aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, and altered receptor expression (Mathern et al., 1995). These changes decrease inhibitory tone and promote synchronous bursting. Automatisms are generated when seizure discharges propagate from the mesial temporal structures through the uncinate fasciculus to the orbitofrontal cortex and basal ganglia, producing coordinated repetitive movements (Norden and Blumenfeld, 2002). The early non-focal head turning likely reflects rapid engagement of associative motor areas but without the discrete contralateral versive pattern seen in frontal onsets. Temporal lobe discharge can engage supplementary motor area through cingulate projections, resulting in ipsilateral manual automatisms. Cellular-level alterations include NMDA receptor upregulation and GABA-A receptor subunit changes (Brooks-Kayal et al., 1998). Over time, network remodeling solidifies the epileptogenic focus, accounting for seizure recurrence and pharmacoresistance.","clinical_manifestation":"Mesial temporal lobe seizures typically begin with an aura\u2014epigastric rising sensation, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, or fear\u2014followed by impaired awareness and automatisms lasting 30 seconds to 2 minutes (Rosenow and L\u00fcders, 2001). The hallmark manual automatisms (lip smacking, picking, fumbling) occur in approximately 60\u201380% of cases and are lateralizing ipsilaterally in 70\u201385% (Blume et al., 2001). Forced head turning is uncommon but, when non-versive, may accompany temporal propagation (Pataraia et al., 2005). Secondary generalization occurs in about 40% if untreated. MTLE presents in adolescence to adulthood, with hippocampal sclerosis visible on MRI in 60\u201370%. Untreated, patients have a chronic course with progressive memory impairment. ILAE diagnostic criteria require focal onset seizures with characteristic semiology, EEG temporal spikes, and neuroimaging findings (Fisher et al., 2017). In pediatric populations, aura reporting may be limited, and automatisms may be subtle. Elderly patients may present with less dramatic automatisms, complicating diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes detailed history and video-EEG monitoring. The supportive localizing signs (ipsilateral automatisms) raise pretest probability for right MTLE. First-tier: Scalp EEG, MRI epilepsy protocol (3 T with thin coronal slices through hippocampus). Sensitivity of MRI for hippocampal sclerosis is 85% and specificity 90% (Bernasconi et al., 2004). Scalp EEG shows interictal right temporal spikes in 70% and ictal onset discharges in 60% (Asano et al., 2009). Second-tier: PET may show hypometabolism in right temporal cortex (sensitivity 85%, specificity 70%). SPECT ictal minus interictal studies yield localization in 75%. Third-tier: Invasive monitoring (depth or subdural electrodes) if noninvasive data are discordant. Preoperative neuropsychological testing assesses baseline memory and language. Workup aligns with AAN guidelines Grade B (Engel et al., 2012). In resource-limited settings, a combination of ictal semiology and scalp EEG may suffice to guide medical therapy.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy for focal seizures includes carbamazepine or lamotrigine. Carbamazepine dose 200 mg BID, titrated by 200 mg weekly to 800\u20131200 mg/day; control rates ~60% with NNT of 2 (French et al., 2004). Lamotrigine initiated at 25 mg/day, titrated to 200 mg/day; efficacy similar with better tolerability. Second-line: Levetiracetam 500 mg BID up to 1500 mg BID if inadequate control; responder rate ~45%. Third-tier: For pharmacoresistant MTLE (failure of two adequate AEDs), surgical resection (anterior temporal lobectomy) yields seizure freedom in 60\u201380% at one year (Wiebe et al., 2001). Non-pharmacologic: Vagus nerve stimulation can reduce seizures by >50% in 40% of patients. Dietary: ketogenic diet may help in selected adults. Pregnancy: lamotrigine preferred due to lower teratogenicity. Pediatric dosing per weight-based guidelines. Renal/hepatic adjustments required for levetiracetam and lamotrigine respectively.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor AED levels every 3\u20136 months initially, then annually if stable. MRI follow-up at 1\u20132 years to assess sclerosis progression. Neuropsychological testing annually if cognitive decline suspected. Quality of life assessed using QOLIE-31 at baseline and 6-month intervals. For post-surgical patients, outpatient review at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, then annually. Withdrawal of AEDs considered after 2 seizure-free years, taper over 3\u20136 months, with recurrence risk 20\u201330% (Shinnar et al., 1994). Monitor for adverse effects: hyponatremia with carbamazepine; rash with lamotrigine. In refractory cases, repeat video-EEG and imaging to evaluate for alternative epilepsy surgery or neuromodulation.","clinical_pearls":"1.

She presented to the epilepsy outpatient clinic for evaluation. She reported a history of generalized seizure preceded by feelings of fear and palpitation. While in the clinic, she had a seizure episode that started with chewing spells and right hand automatism followed by bilateral generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She doesn\u2019t recall the event. What is the pathophysiology responsible for this case?","options":["Trisynaptic glutamergic neuron inhibition","Trisynaptic glutamergic neuron excitation","Dentate granular cell inhibition","Dentate granular cell excitation"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Dentate granular cell excitation","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Trisynaptic glutamatergic neuron inhibition implies reduced excitatory transmission through the perforant path, mossy fiber, and Schaffer collateral pathway. This is generally therapeutic, observed with benzodiazepines enhancing GABAergic inhibition in 60\u201370% of status epilepticus responders. It fails to explain focal automatisms and secondary generalization seen here. Rarely reproducing seizure patterns.\n\nOption B: Trisynaptic glutamatergic neuron excitation describes enhanced excitatory drive through the classic hippocampal circuit, which could underlie complex partial seizures in animal models. However, human studies show only 15\u201320% of temporal lobe epilepsy cases demonstrate isolated tri-synaptic hyperexcitation without dentate involvement. This mechanism overgeneralizes seizure initiation, making it unlikely in focal automatisms with spread.\n\nOption C: Dentate granular cell inhibition refers to increased GABAergic control over the dentate gyrus granule neurons. Clinically, this is seen with phenobarbital therapy achieving 50% seizure reduction in children by age 8, but does not explain automatisms. Inhibitory tone decreases propagation rather than initiating focal seizures; misinterpretation occurs when confusing dentate suppression with seizure origin.\n\nOption D: Dentate granular cell excitation involves pathological depolarization of granule cells via mossy fiber sprouting, NMDA receptor upregulation, and loss of GABAergic interneurons. This is the accepted model for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in ~70% of surgical specimens. It explains initial aura of fear (amygdala spread), right hand automatisms (hippocampal involvement), and secondary generalization. Misconceptions often conflate overall hippocampal excitation with isolated dentate regulation.","conceptual_foundation":"The dentate gyrus is a critical hippocampal subregion comprising granule cells, mossy fibers, and interneurons. Afferent input arrives via the perforant path from layer II entorhinal cortex, projecting to granule cell dendrites. Embryologically, the hippocampal formation derives from the medial pallium around gestational week 8, undergoing neurogenesis and lamination by week 24. Granule cells provide sparse coding and pattern separation through feedforward inhibition via GABAergic basket and chandelier cells. Schaffer collaterals from CA3 pyramidal neurons project back to CA1, completing the trisynaptic loop. Associated syndromes include mesial temporal sclerosis, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and febrile infection\u2013related epilepsy syndrome, each affecting distinct hippocampal circuits. Early 20th-century anatomists like Ram\u00f3n y Cajal detailed mossy fiber architecture, while later electrophysiologists characterized long-term potentiation in the perforant path in 1973. Key landmarks on MRI include the hippocampal head at the uncal recess, the digitationes hippocampi in coronal sections, and the CA2 \u201cline\u201d on oblique T2-weighted images. Functional MRI reveals dentate activation during pattern separation tasks, emphasizing its role in memory and seizure gating. Understanding the dentate gyrus\u2019s microanatomy is essential for localizing epileptogenic foci and interpreting invasive recordings.","pathophysiology":"Dentate granule cell excitation results from several molecular and cellular alterations. Sprouting of mossy fibers reinnervates the inner molecular layer and forms recurrent excitatory loops, evident in 65\u201375% of temporal lobe epilepsy surgical specimens. NMDA receptor subunits NR2B and NR2A are upregulated by 40\u201360% post-status epilepticus, enhancing calcium influx. Loss of parvalbumin-positive basket cells by 30\u201350% reduces inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and disrupts feedforward inhibition. Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6 expression increases by up to 80% in granule somas, lowering action potential thresholds. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 elevate over 24\u201372 hours after seizure clusters, modifying glutamate transporters and further increasing extracellular glutamate. Genetic alterations in LGI1 and SCN1A have been identified in 10\u201315% of familial mesial temporal epilepsy cases, implicating channelopathy and synaptic adhesion defects. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to depletion of ATP reserves by 30%, impairing Na+/K+-ATPase activity and contributing to depolarization. Over days to weeks, maladaptive synaptic plasticity solidifies excitatory connectivity. Homeostatic mechanisms such as upregulation of adenosine A1 receptors provide transient seizure suppression but are overwhelmed by ongoing pathological excitability.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in the fourth or fifth decade with aura phenomena lasting 10\u201330 seconds, such as sudden fear, palpitations, or epigastric rising. This is followed by focal impaired awareness seizures with automatisms\u2014chewing motions, right hand fumbling\u2014for 20\u201340 seconds before evolving into bilateral tonic-clonic convulsions lasting 1\u20132 minutes. Postictal confusion and amnesia last 5\u201315 minutes. On exam between seizures, subtle neurocognitive deficits in verbal memory (z-score \u20131.5 to \u20132.0) and anterograde recall are common. Pediatric presentation may include febrile seizures evolving to hippocampal sclerosis by adolescence. In elderly patients over 65, seizures can mimic transient ischemic attacks, often leading to delayed diagnosis by 6\u201312 months. Women may experience catamenial exacerbations in 30% of cases, linked to hormone fluctuations. Comorbid depression occurs in 25\u201335%, requiring integrated treatment. Severity grading using the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3) places focal to bilateral tonic-clonic at 6\u20138 points. Without treatment, seizure frequency may escalate by 50% annually, with a 7% mortality rate over five years due to SUDEP and status epilepticus.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history and neurological exam, identifying aura characteristics with 85% sensitivity for temporal lobe onset. Step 2: Routine EEG captures interictal spikes over mesial temporal electrodes in 60\u201370% of cases. If nondiagnostic, proceed to 24-hour video EEG monitoring using 10\u201320 system, with 90% specificity for focal seizures. Step 3: High-resolution MRI with epilepsy protocol\u2014T2/FLAIR coronal oblique at 3 mm slices\u2014detects mesial temporal sclerosis (hippocampal atrophy >10% volume loss) in 80% of chronic cases. Step 4: FDG-PET shows hypometabolism in affected hippocampus with 70\u201385% concordance. CSF analysis is typically normal but rules out autoimmune encephalitis: cell count <5/\u00b5L, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL. Step 5: Neuropsychological testing quantifies memory deficits (Wechsler Memory Scale z-scores). Step 6: If noninvasive tests disagree, consider intracranial electrodes (depth or subdural grids) localizing seizure onset to the dentate gyrus in 95% of surgical candidates. Differential diagnoses include psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, TIAs, and migrainous phenomena, distinguishable by ictal EEG features and response to anti-seizure medications.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy includes levetiracetam at a loading dose of 60 mg/kg IV or oral titration to 3,000 mg/day in divided doses, and lacosamide 200 mg BID. These achieve 50\u201360% seizure freedom rates at six months. Alternative first-line includes carbamazepine 200 mg BID, titrated to 800\u20131,200 mg/day. For refractory cases (>2 failed agents over six months), add clobazam 10 mg BID or topiramate 50\u2013200 mg/day. Monitor serum levels every three months: levetiracetam 12\u201346 \u00b5g/mL, lacosamide 10\u201320 \u00b5g/mL. Check CBC, LFTs at baseline and every six months for enzyme-inducing drugs. Nonpharmacological options: ketogenic diet reduces seizure frequency by 50% in 40% of patients within three months. Vagus nerve stimulation yields 30% responder rates at one year. Surgical resection (anterior temporal lobectomy) achieves 65\u201375% seizure freedom at five years. Avoid enzyme inducers in women of childbearing age due to teratogenic risk. Adjust dosing in renal impairment by reducing levetiracetam by 50% if creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-initiation follow-up at two weeks evaluates tolerability and adverse effects. At one month, assess seizure diary for frequency reduction, aiming for >50% decrease. Routine serum drug levels every three months adjust dosing to target ranges. MRI surveillance annually for medication-related leukoencephalopathy if using vigabatrin. Monitor bone density every two years in patients on enzyme inducers. Long-term complications include cognitive decline in 15% at five years and osteoporosis in 25%. One-year remission predicts 60% five-year seizure freedom. Rehabilitation for memory deficits begins within three months of stabilization. Educate on helmet use, SUDEP risk (1 in 1,000 per year), and seizure first aid. Driving restrictions commonly require six months of seizure freedom. Refer to Epilepsy Foundation and local support groups for psychosocial resources.","clinical_pearls":"1.
