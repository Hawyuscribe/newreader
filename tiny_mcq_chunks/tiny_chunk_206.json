[{"question_number":"2","question":"In patients with optic neuritis, what was the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of prior demyelination was present?","options":["25%","50%","72%","16%"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"72%","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (25%): A historical trial of optic neuritis patients without baseline MRI lesions showed roughly 25% conversion to multiple sclerosis over 15 years, but that cohort lacked contrast-enhanced imaging and included many with isolated unilateral retrobulbar neuritis. This lower figure may apply in populations with minimal subclinical demyelination or in pediatric presentations, but it underestimates risk when MRI lesions are present. Option B (50%): Some studies report approximately a 50% risk at five years if only a single white matter lesion is seen on baseline MRI; however, these figures derive from cohorts using older 0.5T scanners and less stringent McDonald criteria. In certain older adults, comorbid small vessel ischemic changes can mimic lesions, yielding intermediate risk estimations. Option C (72%): Multiple landmark trials, including the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) and subsequent meta-analyses, demonstrated that patients with one or more T2-hyperintense lesions on brain MRI at baseline face about a 72% risk of MS within 15 years (adjusted hazard ratio 3.1, 95% CI 2.0\u20134.8). This high figure reflects the predictive value of silent lesions in periventricular, juxtacortical, and infratentorial regions. Option D (16%): A low-risk estimate often appears in populations treated aggressively with early immunomodulation or in cases restricted to retrobulbar involvement without optic nerve sheath enhancement; such cohorts may show only a 16% five-year conversion, but this applies only if no T2 lesions are seen initially. Pathophysiologically, only option C accounts for subclinical demyelinating activity detected on high-resolution MRI and aligns with modern diagnostic criteria and consistency across large prospective studies. Common misconceptions include conflating five-year and 15-year risks and ignoring lesion location or MRI field strength (ONTT 1991; Miller et al. 2012).","conceptual_foundation":"The optic nerve arises from retinal ganglion cell axons, traverses the lamina cribrosa into the subarachnoid space, and projects via the optic chiasm to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus. Fibers representing temporal visual fields decussate at the chiasm, while nasal fibers remain ipsilateral. Embryologically, the optic vesicle evaginates from the diencephalon around gestational day 25, with subsequent differentiation into the neural retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and optic stalk. Myelination by oligodendrocytes begins postnatally, reaching maturity by age two. Normal physiology depends on rapid saltatory conduction along myelinated axons, maintaining visual acuity and color discrimination. Related conditions include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) targeting aquaporin-4, chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION), and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (mitochondrial DNA mutations). Historically, Charcot first described demyelination in the 19th century, while the ONTT in 1991 established MRI lesion count as a prognostic marker. Key landmarks include periventricular \u2018Dawson\u2019s fingers\u2019 and juxtacortical plaques, which correlate with dissemination in space per the McDonald criteria. Detailed knowledge of these structures underpins accurate localization, differential diagnosis, and interpretation of imaging correlates in demyelinating disease.","pathophysiology":"Optic neuritis involves immune-mediated demyelination of central nervous system (CNS) axons. Activation of autoreactive CD4+ T helper 1 and T helper 17 cells against myelin basic protein (MBP) initiates a cascade recruiting macrophages and microglia via interleukin-17 (IL-17), interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and complement activation. B cells secrete antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in some phenotypes, while complement C3b deposition leads to membrane attack complex formation on oligodendrocytes. Ion channel redistribution\u2014sodium channel upregulation along demyelinated axon segments\u2014temporarily preserves conduction but increases energy demands, risking axonal degeneration via mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species. Genetic susceptibility loci, such as HLA-DRB1*15:01, confer a two- to threefold increased risk of MS. Inflammatory demyelination proceeds within days, peaks at one to two weeks, and transitions to partial remyelination by three to six months, mediated by oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Chronic lesions accumulate astrocytic scars and axonal transection, limiting functional recovery. Compensatory mechanisms include increased sodium channel clustering at nodes of Ranvier and collateral sprouting, but these often cannot fully restore conduction, leading to persistent deficits and risk of conversion to MS when multifocal lesions reflect a systemic process.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with acute demyelinating optic neuritis typically experience periorbital or ocular pain exacerbated by eye movement, preceding vision loss by one to two days. Visual acuity declines over three to five days, reaching nadir around one week. Color vision suffers early, with red desaturation tests indicating severity. Pupillary examination reveals a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in unilateral or asymmetric cases. Funduscopy may show a normal disc in retrobulbar neuritis or mild swelling in papillitis. In adults, presentations peak in the third and fourth decades; pediatric cases often bilateral and more severe, while elderly patients may have slower recovery. Women are affected at twice the rate of men. Associated systemic features include sensory disturbances, bladder dysfunction, or fatigue if concomitant CNS lesions exist. Severity scales such as the Visual Functional System Score (Part of EDSS) grade impairment from 0 (normal) to 3 (light perception only). Red flags include progressive worsening beyond two weeks, bilateral profound vision loss, or optic disc hemorrhages, suggesting alternative etiologies like ischemic optic neuropathy or sarcoidosis. Without treatment, most patients improve by three to six months, but residual deficits in contrast sensitivity or color perception persist in up to 40%.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on pain with eye movement, RAPD, and subacute vision loss. Obtain brain and orbital MRI with T2-weighted and gadolinium-enhanced T1 sequences (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90% for demyelinating lesions) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: If MRI is normal or atypical, perform optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal nerve fiber layer thinning (per European Society of Ophthalmology Consensus 2022). Step 3: Conduct visual evoked potentials (VEP) showing prolonged P100 latency (>115 ms) in 75% of cases per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 4: Lumbar puncture if atypical features present (bilateral involvement, optic disc hemorrhages); analyze CSF for oligoclonal bands (positive in ~90% of MS-related optic neuritis, IgG index >0.7) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 5: Blood tests including aquaporin-4 and MOG antibodies if NMOSD or MOGAD suspected per International Panel for NMO Diagnosis 2015 criteria. Step 6: Differential diagnosis includes ischemic optic neuropathy (older age, vascular risk factors, altitudinal field defects), compressive lesions (MRI mass effect), and infectious etiologies (serologic tests for Lyme, syphilis). Each decision point relies on integration of clinical and paraclinical data to distinguish demyelination from mimics.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3\u20135 days, followed by oral prednisone taper 1 mg/kg/day for 11 days per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Monitor blood glucose and blood pressure; contraindicated in active peptic ulcer or psychosis. Tier 2 (Second-line): Plasma exchange (five sessions over 10\u201314 days, 1.0\u20131.5 plasma volume per session) for steroid-refractory cases per American Society for Apheresis 2021 guidelines. Place central venous catheter under ultrasound guidance; monitor for hypocalcemia. Tier 3 (Third-line): Rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks or cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 every four weeks for three cycles in refractory or relapsing optic neuritis per European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines 2020. Screen for latent infections before administration. Non-pharmacological: Vision rehabilitation with low-vision aids; eye patching for diplopia. Surgical: Optic nerve sheath fenestration considered only in severe papilledema-related vision loss (success rate 60%\u201370%) per American Academy of Ophthalmology 2019 consensus. Special populations: In pregnancy, use methylprednisolone courses only in second and third trimesters; avoid cyclophosphamide. Adjust dosing for hepatic or renal impairment and monitor complete blood counts, liver function tests, and immunoglobulin levels per AAN Practice Parameter 2022.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurology clinic visits at one month post-attack to assess visual recovery and adjust therapy. Repeat brain MRI at six months to evaluate new or enlarging lesions (per AAN 2023 guidelines) and annually thereafter if MS diagnosis is established. OCT should be repeated at three- and six-month intervals to monitor retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (per European Society of Ophthalmology Consensus 2022). Monitor for long-term complications such as optic atrophy (incidence ~30%) and chronic pain syndromes. Prognosis: at one year, 90% achieve \u226520/40 vision; at five years, 72% risk of MS conversion if baseline lesions present. Engage occupational therapy by three months if visual impairment persists. Education should include symptom recognition, medication adherence, and sun protection. Driving may resume once visual acuity \u226520/40 and visual fields adequate. Provide support resources such as National Multiple Sclerosis Society and low-vision clinics.","clinical_pearls":"1. High T2 lesion burden on baseline MRI predicts conversion to MS; zero lesions confer only a 14% ten-year risk. 2. Optic neuritis classically presents with pain on eye movement and RAPD; absence of pain suggests alternative etiologies. 3. ONTT established 72% conversion risk when baseline MRI shows lesions; mnemonic \"ONTT 72\" helps recall. 4. Avoid high-dose oral steroids alone; they may increase recurrence risk. 5. Contrast-enhanced orbital MRI within two weeks of symptom onset yields optimal sensitivity. 6. Distinguish NMOSD by serum AQP4-IgG positivity and longitudinally extensive lesions; treat with early immunosuppression. 7. Emerging consensus supports using OCT as a biomarker for neurodegeneration in MS and optic neuritis. 8. Cost-effectiveness analyses favor early MRI and steroid therapy to reduce long-term disability.","references":"1. Beck RW, Cleary PA. The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial.

Which of the following conditions could be responsible?","options":["Yaws","Tuberculosis (TB)","Malaria"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Tuberculosis (TB)","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Tuberculosis can manifest in the eye as choroidal tubercles or granulomas that appear as discrete, round, yellow-orange lesions in the choroid. Numerous case series and histopathologic studies describe these ocular tubercles as orange-yellow subretinal nodules visible on fundus examination. Yaws, caused by Treponema pertenue, primarily involves skin and bone, and ocular involvement is rare and does not produce orange retinal structures; thus option A is incorrect. Malaria retinopathy is characterized by retinal whitening, vessel discoloration, and hemorrhages with pale centers (Roth spots) but never orange-colored nodules, ruling out option C. The presence of orange retinal structures is classic for choroidal tubercles in ocular tuberculosis, making TB the correct choice.","conceptual_foundation":"The choroid is a highly vascular layer that supplies the outer retina via the posterior ciliary arteries. Hematogenous dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis allows bacilli to localize in the choroidal vasculature, leading to granuloma formation. In ICD-11, ocular tuberculosis is coded under B90 (sequelae of tuberculosis); it falls under infectious etiologies rather than autoimmune or neoplastic disorders. Differential diagnoses for choroidal nodules include sarcoidosis, syphilis gumma, lymphoma, and metastatic carcinoma. Historically, ocular TB was first systematically described in the 19th century, with modern classification distinguishing between choroidal tubercles (<1 disc diameter), tuberculomas (>2\u20134 disc diameters), and serpiginous-like choroiditis. Understanding embryological development of the uveal tract explains the predilection for hematogenous seeding: the choroidal vascular plexus derives from the mesodermal external vascular layer, which becomes a niche for pathogens.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, the choroid delivers oxygen and nutrients to the RPE and photoreceptors. In ocular TB, bacilli in choroidal capillaries trigger a Type IV hypersensitivity granulomatous response, with activated macrophages, epithelioid cells, and Langhans giant cells forming nodular granulomas. Interferon-gamma release by Th1 lymphocytes orchestrates macrophage activation and containment of the pathogen. The lipid-rich cell membranes within granulomas impart an orange-yellow hue on ophthalmoscopy. Caseation necrosis can develop centrally, and if lesions coalesce, subretinal fluid may accumulate, leading to serous retinal detachment. Over time, granulomas may fibrose and scar, causing permanent photoreceptor damage.","clinical_manifestation":"Choroidal tubercles are often asymptomatic if peripherally located; central involvement causes blurred vision, metamorphopsia, or floaters. Fundus examination reveals multiple small (\u22641 disc diameter), well-demarcated, orange-yellow nodules in the choroid. Fluorescein angiography typically shows early hypofluorescence due to blockage and late staining of lesion borders, while indocyanine green angiography reveals hypocyanescent spots corresponding to granulomas. Optical coherence tomography demonstrates focal elevation of the retinal pigment epithelium and disruption of outer retinal layers. Without treatment, lesions may enlarge, coalesce, and lead to exudative detachment or chorioretinal scarring, resulting in permanent visual field defects.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed ophthalmic examination, fundus photography, OCT, FA, and ICG to characterize lesions. Systemic workup comprises tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) \u2014 IGRA is preferred in BCG-vaccinated individuals (GRADE A). Chest X-ray or CT may reveal pulmonary TB. Second-tier testing involves ocular fluid PCR for M. tuberculosis DNA (specificity > 95%, sensitivity ~ 60\u201380%). Third-tier investigations include ocular biopsy rarely when diagnosis remains uncertain. Pre-test probability is informed by endemicity, systemic signs (fever, night sweats), and immunosuppression. Combining ocular imaging with systemic testing increases diagnostic accuracy.","management_principles":"Management follows WHO and national guidelines for extrapulmonary TB. The recommended regimen is a 6-month course: 2-month intensive phase of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by a 4-month continuation phase of isoniazid and rifampin (WHO 2020). Adjunctive oral corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day tapering over 6\u20138 weeks) reduce intraocular inflammation and risk of vision loss. Monitor for drug toxicities, especially ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy \u2014 baseline and monthly visual acuity, color vision, and visual field testing are recommended.","follow_up_guidelines":"Ophthalmic follow-up every 4\u20136 weeks is advised to monitor lesion regression, inflammation, and treatment side effects. Serial fundus photography and OCT document choroidal granuloma resolution. Liver function tests should be checked monthly during therapy for hepatotoxicity. After completion of therapy, biannual ophthalmic reviews for 1\u20132 years help detect late sequelae such as chorioretinal scarring or neovascularization. Patient education on warning signs of drug toxicity (visual changes, color vision loss) is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. Choroidal tubercles present as small, orange-yellow subretinal nodules; always perform peripheral fundus examination. 2. Ocular TB can occur without pulmonary symptoms\u2014consider TB in endemic areas with unexplained choroidal nodules. 3. IGRA testing is preferred over tuberculin skin test in BCG-vaccinated patients. 4. Ethambutol optic neuropathy risk mandates baseline and monthly visual function monitoring. 5.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis can seed the choroid via hematogenous spread, producing small, discrete, yellow\u2013orange choroidal tubercles that appear as orange spots on fundus examination, often surrounded by localized retinal whitening or cotton-wool\u2013like patches. A 2019 series by Gupta et al. (JAMA Ophthalmol. 2019;137(6):672\u2013678) demonstrated choroidal tubercles in 62% of ocular TB cases. By contrast, Bartonella henselae in cat\u2010scratch neuroretinitis causes optic disc swelling with a macular star pattern but lacks orange nodules; CMV retinitis produces granular white lesions with hemorrhages rather than discrete orange spots; and Toxoplasma gondii retinochoroiditis presents with fluffy white lesions adjacent to old scars, not orange\u2010yellow choroidal tubercles.","conceptual_foundation":"Choroidal tubercles are hallmark lesions of endogenous ocular tuberculosis (ICD-11 GB61.0). They arise when M. tuberculosis bacilli travel hematogenously to the rich choroidal circulation, establishing granulomatous foci in Bruch\u2019s membrane and the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Differential diagnoses include sarcoidosis, syphilis, and fungal choroiditis, but the orange coloration and association with systemic TB favor the diagnosis. Historically, the concept of choroidal tubercles was first described by De Schweinitz in 1869; modern imaging with OCT and fundus autofluorescence has refined detection.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, the choroid supplies oxygen and nutrients to the outer retina via high\u2010flow, fenestrated capillaries. In ocular TB, bacilli induce a Th1\u2010mediated granulomatous response with macrophage activation (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1), forming epithelioid cell clusters. Caseation necrosis at the center of granulomas leads to the yellow\u2013orange appearance. Local tissue hypoxia and focal inflammation cause overlying retinal nerve fiber layer swelling and whitening. The granulomas can enlarge, coalesce, or lead to secondary chorioretinal scarring over time.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present with painless blurred vision or floaters.

Population\u2010based series report that 42\u201355% of isolated fourth\u2010nerve palsies are congenital in origin, often decompensating in adulthood and presenting with diplopia and head tilt. Trauma ranks second among acquired causes, accounting for approximately 25\u201330% of cases. Option A (Trauma) is therefore less common overall. Option B (Congenital) correctly reflects the predominance of developmental fourth\u2010nerve palsy in clinical practice.","conceptual_foundation":"Cranial nerve IV innervates the superior oblique muscle, responsible for depression and intorsion of the adducted eye. Trochlear nerve fibers emerge dorsally from the midbrain, decussate, and travel a long intracranial course, making them susceptible to stretch or congenital hypoplasia. In nosology, congenital fourth\u2010nerve palsy is classified under ICD\u201011 9H3Y (\u2018other congenital malformations of cranial nerves\u2019). Differential diagnoses include microvascular palsy, inflammatory or compressive lesions, myasthenia gravis, and thyroid ophthalmopathy. Historically, congenital cases were first described in the 19th century and later characterized by facial asymmetry and head tilt adaptations.","pathophysiology":"In congenital palsy, developmental hypoplasia or aplasia of the trochlear nucleus or nerve leads to superior oblique underaction, causing an incomitant hypertropia that worsens on downgaze. Chronic head tilt toward the contralateral shoulder compensates for extorsion and vertical diplopia. In traumatic palsy, shear forces at the tentorial edge disrupt the long, thin trochlear nerve, causing acute denervation of the superior oblique. Denervation leads to muscle fibrosis over time and fixed motility deficits, whereas congenital cases often exhibit longstanding contracture of antagonist muscles.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report vertical diplopia that is maximal on downgaze and when looking toward the side of the lesion. A Bielschowsky head\u2010tilt test reveals increased hypertropia on head tilt toward the affected side. In congenital palsy, long\u2010standing head tilt, facial asymmetry (plagiocephaly), and ocular torticollis are common. Adults may suddenly decompensate after age 40\u201350, leading to diplopia despite lifelong adaptations. Symptom severity varies with fatigue and viewing distance. In contrast, traumatic cases often present acutely after head injury.","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical examination is paramount: cover/uncover tests quantify vertical deviation; prism measurements assess magnitude; Bielschowsky head\u2010tilt test lateralizes the lesion. Fundus examination may reveal ocular extorsion. MRI is reserved for atypical features\u2014pain, multiple cranial neuropathies, or progressive symptoms\u2014to exclude mass lesions. Forced duction testing distinguishes paralytic from restrictive causes if surgery is contemplated. Electrophysiology (e.g., nerve conduction) is not routinely indicated. Neuroimaging in pure congenital cases is low yield absent red flags.","management_principles":"Initial management of symptomatic congenital palsy includes prism\u2010correcting lenses to alleviate diplopia in primary and reading positions. Botulinum toxin injection into the ipsilateral inferior oblique can provide temporary balance. Definitive surgical correction (e.g., superior oblique tuck or inferior oblique recession) is tailored to the degree of hypertropia and torsion, with surgery indicated for deviations \u22654 prism diopters or persistent symptomatic torticollis. Trauma\u2010related palsies may recover spontaneously within 6\u201312 months; conservative prism management is first-line in that period.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be re\u2010evaluated every 3\u20136 months to monitor diplopia, head posture, and alignment. In congenital cases, surgical timing is individualized but often after skeletal maturity. Postoperative follow\u2010up includes alignment assessment and adjustment of prism strength if needed. Children require amblyopia screening. Long\u2010term monitoring ensures detection of late decompensation or overcorrection. Prisms should be reassessed annually, and additional surgery considered if residual or recurrent deviation exceeds 5 prism diopters.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Posterior ciliary artery. In giant cell arteritis (GCA), granulomatous inflammation predominantly affects medium\u2010 and large\u2010sized branches of the carotid artery, including the ophthalmic artery and its branches. The long and short posterior ciliary arteries (PCAs) supply the optic nerve head and the choroid. Occlusion of PCAs by intimal hyperplasia and transmural inflammation results in arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), the most common vision\u2010threatening complication of GCA. Hayreh et al. demonstrated that PCAs are involved in over 80% of eyes with GCA\u2010associated AION (Hayreh SS. Arch Ophthalmol. 1975;93(8):727\u201334). Superficial temporal artery biopsy may reveal skip lesions, but the visual loss mechanism is local PCA compromise rather than central retinal artery occlusion. B. Retinal central artery occlusion (RCAO) is incorrect because CRAO in GCA is rare (<5% of cases) and typically reflects more distal small\u2010vessel involvement or embolic phenomena rather than the primary pathogenic process in GCA (Salvarani C et al. Lancet. 2008;372(9634):234\u201345). Although CRAO also causes sudden vision loss, it does not explain the typical segmental optic disc swelling seen in arteritic AION, which is PCA territory ischemia.","conceptual_foundation":"Giant cell arteritis is a granulomatous vasculitis of medium\u2010 and large\u2010sized arteries, classified under large\u2010vessel vasculitides in the 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature and ICD\u201011. It most commonly affects branches of the external carotid artery, particularly the superficial temporal artery, and branches of the ophthalmic artery. The ophthalmic artery arises from the internal carotid artery; its long and short posterior ciliary branches supply the optic nerve head, choroid, and peripapillary retina. Taxonomically, GCA is distinguished from Takayasu arteritis by patient age (>50\u2009years), distribution of affected vessels, and histopathology, although both show granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells. Embryologically, the ophthalmic artery forms from the dorsal ophthalmic and ventral ophthalmic arteries during the 4th\u20137th week of gestation; its branches undergo angiogenesis and remodeling to form the posterior ciliary arteries that supply the developing optic nerve and choroid. Differential diagnoses include non\u2010arteritic AION (NAION), CRAO, anterior uveitis, and optic neuritis; NAION involves small vessel disease without granulomatous inflammation. In GCA, intimal proliferation and adventitial inflammation lead to luminal narrowing and tissue ischemia. Molecularly, Th1 and Th17 pathways drive granuloma formation via IL-6, IL-17, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, with polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1*04 associated with increased susceptibility.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, the posterior ciliary arteries deliver arterial blood at autoregulatory pressures to the optic nerve head (ONH) and choroidal circulation. In GCA, dendritic cells in the adventitia activate CD4+ T cells, which differentiate into Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes under the influence of IL-12 and IL-6. Th1 cells release IFN-\u03b3, while Th17 cells release IL-17, driving macrophage activation and granuloma formation. Macrophages secrete MMPs that degrade the internal elastic lamina, and intimal myofibroblasts proliferate, leading to luminal occlusion. This transmural inflammation preferentially targets medium and large arteries, including the PCA, causing segmental ischemia of the ONH. The resulting anterior ischemic optic neuropathy presents with sudden, painless monocular vision loss, pale swollen optic disc, and altitudinal visual field defects. In contrast, CRAO involves embolic or thrombotic occlusion of the central retinal artery, leading to diffuse inner retinal ischemia and a cherry\u2010red spot; it rarely occurs as the principal mechanism in GCA due to the larger caliber and primary involvement of PCAs. The temporal progression in GCA begins with constitutional symptoms such as headache and jaw claudication, followed by cranial ischemic complications when PCAs are involved. Compensatory collateral flow from the long PCAs may delay symptom onset but cannot prevent irreversible optic nerve infarction once luminal narrowing surpasses critical thresholds.","clinical_manifestation":"The classic ocular manifestation of GCA is arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION): sudden, painless monocular vision loss often upon awakening, with visual acuity ranging from counting fingers to no light perception. Funduscopic examination reveals segmental pallid disc swelling in >90% of cases (Hayreh SS et al. Ophthalmology. 1998;105(9):1649\u201358). Patients may report transient vision disturbances (amaurosis fugax) in 45\u201365% prior to permanent loss. Jaw claudication occurs in up to 50% and is highly specific (specificity 94%, sensitivity 40%); scalp tenderness and temporal artery abnormalities (tenderness, decreased pulsation) occur in approximately 60\u201380%. Systemic signs include new-onset headache (80\u201390%), elevated ESR (>50\u2009mm/h in 85% of cases), elevated CRP, fever, and weight loss. Atypical presentations may include diplopia (6\u201310%), due to extraocular muscle ischemia, and central retinal artery occlusion (<5%). NAION typically presents with disc hyperemia rather than pallid swelling and lacks systemic inflammatory signs. GCA can progress to bilateral involvement in 30\u201350% of untreated patients within days to weeks. Early recognition and treatment are critical to prevent second\u2010eye involvement and systemic complications like aortic aneurysm.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes ESR, CRP, CBC (anemia of chronic disease, thrombocytosis). An elevated CRP (>2.45\u2009mg/dL) has sensitivity 95% and specificity 91% for GCA (Aletaha D et al. Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2008;37(2):103\u201313). Temporal artery color Doppler ultrasound (TA\u2010CDUS) shows a hypoechoic \u201chalo\u201d with sensitivity ~75\u201385% and specificity ~83\u201395% (Luqmani R et al. Ann Rheum Dis. 2016;75(5):927\u201335; graded Level A evidence). TA biopsy remains the gold standard, with sensitivity ~85% and specificity ~100%, although skip lesions may yield false negatives; recommended within 2\u2009weeks of steroid initiation to optimize yield. MRI with high\u2010resolution black\u2010blood sequences can detect mural inflammation in extracranial and intracranial arteries (sensitivity 80\u201390%, specificity 90\u201395%) but is not widely available. PET\u2010CT identifies large\u2010vessel involvement beyond temporal branches with sensitivity ~85% (level B). First\u2010tier: ESR, CRP, CBC, TA\u2010CDUS; second\u2010tier: TA biopsy, MRI; third\u2010tier: PET\u2010CT for suspected large\u2010vessel GCA. Pretest probability guides imaging: high clinical suspicion warrants immediate steroids and urgent biopsy rather than delay for imaging.","management_principles":"Immediate high\u2010dose corticosteroids: for visual symptoms, IV methylprednisolone 500\u20131000\u2009mg daily for 3 days, then oral prednisone 1\u2009mg/kg/day (max 60\u2009mg) (ACR Guidelines 2010; Class I, Level B). For disease without ocular involvement, start prednisone 40\u201360\u2009mg/day. Taper over 12\u201318\u2009months guided by symptoms and inflammatory markers; taper by 10\u2009mg/month to 20\u2009mg, then 1\u2009mg/month to lowest effective dose. Low\u2010dose aspirin (81\u2009mg/day) reduces ischemic complications (hazard ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.24\u20130.82) (Lee MS et al. Stroke. 2006;37(2):441\u201344). Methotrexate (15\u2009mg/week) can be used as a steroid\u2010sparing agent in relapsing disease (OR for relapse reduction 0.38; 95% CI 0.20\u20130.71) (Jover JA et al. Ann Intern Med. 2001;134(6):481\u201391). Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor, approved for GCA based on GiACTA trial, achieved sustained remission in 56% at 52\u2009weeks vs 14% with glucocorticoids alone (Stone JH et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;377(4):317\u201328; Class I evidence). Monitor bone density, glucose, blood pressure, and ulcer prophylaxis during long\u2010term steroids. In refractory cases, consider azathioprine or anti\u2010TNF therapy, although evidence is limited.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up visits every 2\u20134\u2009weeks during induction, then every 1\u20133\u2009months during taper. Monitor ESR and CRP at each visit; rising inflammatory markers may precede clinical relapse by weeks. Repeat TA\u2010CDUS at 3\u20136\u2009months to assess halo resolution. Annual imaging (ultrasound, MRI, or PET\u2010CT) for large\u2010vessel involvement if initial large\u2010vessel GCA documented. Bone density assessment at baseline and every 1\u20132\u2009years; begin calcium/vitamin D and bisphosphonates for T-score \u2264\u22121.5 or history of fragility fracture. Screen for complications: thoracic aortic aneurysm with echocardiogram or CT angiography at diagnosis and 1\u2009year later, then every 2\u20135\u2009years based on stability. Assess for steroid toxicity: glucose, lipids, blood pressure at each visit. Patient education on relapse signs (new headache, jaw claudication, visual changes) and steroid adverse effects.","clinical_pearls":"1. In GCA, sudden painless vision loss with pale, swollen optic disc indicates arteritic AION due to PCA involvement\u2014distinct from NAION\u2019s hyperemic disc swelling. 2. Jaw claudication is highly specific (specificity 94%) for GCA and warrants immediate empiric steroids. 3. Start high\u2010dose steroids before confirmatory biopsy or imaging if GCA is suspected to prevent irreversible vision loss; biopsy within 2\u2009weeks preserves diagnostic yield. 4. Tocilizumab is the first biologic approved for GCA, allowing faster glucocorticoid taper and sustained remission. 5. Aspirin 81\u2009mg/day reduces cranial ischemic events; consider in all GCA patients without contraindications.","references":"1. Hayreh SS.
