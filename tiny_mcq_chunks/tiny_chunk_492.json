[{"question_number":"4","question":"A 29-year-old female came to the neurology clinic asking for a third opinion regarding her headache. The first physician diagnosed her with cluster headache, while the second physician diagnosed her with SUNCT headache. What is the best way to differentiate between these two headache types?","options":["Response to treatment","Duration of the attack","Brain imaging ## Page 22"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Duration of the attack","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The best way to differentiate cluster headache from SUNCT is the duration of the attack. Cluster headache attacks last between 15 and 180 minutes, often recurring up to eight times per day, whereas SUNCT (Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform headache with Conjunctival injection and Tearing) attacks are much briefer, typically lasting from 1 to 240 seconds and occurring dozens to hundreds of times per day. Option A (Response to treatment) is unreliable: although high-flow oxygen and subcutaneous sumatriptan are effective in cluster headache, SUNCT often shows variable or poor response to these therapies and requires antiepileptic drugs such as lamotrigine. Option C (Brain imaging) is necessary to exclude secondary causes but does not distinguish between primary trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, as both cluster headache and SUNCT usually have normal neuroimaging. Thus, duration is the defining clinical discriminant under ICHD-3 criteria (Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Cluster headache and SUNCT are classified under trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) in the ICHD-3. TACs share unilateral trigeminal distribution pain with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. In ICD-11, cluster headache is coded under 8A80.00, and SUNCT under 8A80.01. Embryologically, trigeminal sensory neurons derive from the neural crest; parasympathetic preganglionic fibers originate from brainstem nuclei. Anatomically, both disorders involve the trigeminal-autonomic reflex arc: trigeminal afferents synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus and project to the superior salivatory nucleus, which drives parasympathetic outflow via the sphenopalatine ganglion. Hypothalamic activation is characteristic of cluster headache (shown on PET imaging), whereas SUNCT arises from paroxysmal excitability at the trigeminal root entry zone. Genetically, cluster headache shows HCRTR2 and ADH4 polymorphisms; SUNCT has no consistent genetic markers identified to date.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, nociceptive signals from the trigeminal nerve synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus and modulate autonomic outflow via the superior salivatory nucleus. In cluster headache, hypothalamic activation (posterior inferior hypothalamic gray matter) triggers sustained trigeminal nociceptive firing and parasympathetic activation, producing lacrimation and nasal congestion. In SUNCT, brief, spontaneous ectopic discharges in the trigeminal afferents produce short\u2010lasting pain with subsequent cranial autonomic activation. Molecularly, calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide (CGRP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase\u2013activating peptide (PACAP) are elevated during cluster attacks; SUNCT shows transient elevations of CGRP but lacks sustained neuropeptide release. The difference in attack duration reflects sustained central sensitization in cluster versus paroxysmal peripheral trigeminal hyperexcitability in SUNCT.","clinical_manifestation":"Cluster headache presents with severe, unilateral periorbital pain lasting 15\u2013180 minutes, with a frequency of 1 every other day to 8 per day, often following circadian rhythms. Autonomic signs include conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, ptosis, and eyelid edema. SUNCT manifests as brief (1\u2013240 seconds) stabs of unilateral orbital or temporal pain, occurring 30\u2013200 times per day, with prominent conjunctival injection and tearing. Unlike cluster, SUNCT lacks strict periodicity, and may be continuous or random. Both occur more frequently in males, but SUNCT has a roughly equal sex distribution. Prodromal features (aura) are absent in both.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on ICHD-3 criteria. First-tier evaluation: detailed headache diary documenting attack duration, frequency, and autonomic features; comprehensive neurologic exam to exclude red flags; MRI brain with pituitary protocol to rule out structural lesions. Second-tier: consider high-resolution trigeminal nerve imaging if secondary SUNCT is suspected. No laboratory biomarkers exist. Sensitivity/specificity of clinical criteria for cluster headache are >90%. Pretest probability is high in classic presentations. Distinguishing by duration (>15 min vs <4 min) has a near-perfect positive predictive value for TAC subtype under controlled studies (J Headache Pain. 2018;19:72).","management_principles":"Acute cluster headache therapy: high-flow oxygen (12\u201315 L/min for 15 min; abortive in 70% of attacks) and subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg (effective in >75% within 10 min). Preventive: verapamil titrated to 360\u2013960 mg/day (Level A); lithium 600\u20131200 mg/day (Level B); occipital nerve stimulation for refractory cases (Level C). SUNCT acute therapy: lamotrigine starting 25 mg/day, titrated to 200 mg/day (response in 60%); oxcarbazepine 600\u20132100 mg/day; intravenous lidocaine in refractory status SUNCT. Triptans and oxygen are generally ineffective. Monitor ECG in high-dose verapamil. Treatment selection is guided by ICHD-3 practice parameters.","follow_up_guidelines":"Cluster headache: re-evaluate every 4\u20136 weeks to adjust verapamil; obtain ECG at baseline and monthly once >240 mg/day. Maintain headache diary. SUNCT: follow-up every 6\u20138 weeks to titrate antiepileptics; monitor for lamotrigine rash within first 8 weeks; assess attack frequency and side effects. Repeat imaging if atypical features emerge. Provide patient education on attack recognition and abortive treatment use.","clinical_pearls":"1. Duration is the key diagnostic discriminator: cluster 15\u2013180 min vs SUNCT seconds\u20134 min. 2. High-flow oxygen is both diagnostic and therapeutic in cluster headache (abortive in ~70% of attacks). 3. Sumatriptan is effective in cluster but not in SUNCT\u2014lack of triptan response suggests SUNCT. 4. Lamotrigine is first-line preventive therapy for SUNCT; titrate slowly to avoid Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 5. Always obtain MRI to exclude secondary causes when TAC features are atypical or treatment refractory.","references":"1. Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society.

What is the most appropriate action?","options":["Reassurance","Immediate hospitalization","Start prophylactic migraine medication","Refer for neurosurgery"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Reassurance","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Reassurance): Correct. In patients with chronic migraine, incidental periventricular or subcortical white matter lesions (WML) on T2/FLAIR MRI are observed in up to 40% of migraineurs versus 10% in controls (Lipton et al. Neurology 2004). Multiple large prospective cohorts (n=1,200) demonstrated stable lesion burden over 4\u20135 years with no progression to demyelinating disease in 98% of cases (Kurth et al. Neurology 2011). Reassurance avoids unnecessary hospitalization and invasive workup in asymptomatic patients lacking red flags such as progressive focal deficits, seizures, or systemic signs. Option B (Immediate hospitalization): Incorrect. Hospital admission is indicated in <5% of headache cases, specifically those with acute neurologic deterioration, signs of raised intracranial pressure, or febrile meningoencephalitis. A scenario involving sudden-onset thunderclap headache, papilledema, or altered consciousness might warrant admission, but our patient presents none of these. Option C (Start prophylactic migraine medication): Partially reasonable but premature. Prophylaxis (e.g. propranolol 80\u2013160\u2009mg/day, topiramate 50\u2013100\u2009mg/day) is selected based on attack frequency \u22654 per month or disability scales (MIDAS >11) rather than incidental MRI findings. Guidelines recommend waiting 2\u20134 headache diaries before initiating pharmacologic prophylaxis. Option D (Refer for neurosurgery): Clearly incorrect. Neurosurgical referral is reserved for lesions causing mass effect or hydrocephalus (e.g. large tumors, Chiari malformation). Incidental WML lack contrast enhancement, mass effect, or edema. A common misconception is equating white matter hyperintensities with multiple sclerosis; however, typical migraine WML are small (<3\u2009mm), punctate, and located in deep or subcortical regions without callosal involvement. The American Headache Society 2021 guidelines and ICHD-3 criteria emphasize clinical context over imaging anomalies; reassuring the patient is supported by a class I level A recommendation.","conceptual_foundation":"White matter lesions in migraine are tiny T2 hyperintense foci primarily in periventricular, deep subcortical, and corpus callosum watershed regions. Anatomically, these lesions involve oligodendrocyte-rich areas adjacent to lateral ventricles and U-fibers beneath the cortex. The trigeminovascular system begins at first-order neurons in the trigeminal ganglion projecting centrally to the spinal trigeminal nucleus and onward to thalamic ventroposteromedial nuclei, then to cortical pain-processing regions (insula, anterior cingulate, somatosensory cortices). Embryologically, white matter arises from radial glial progenitors migrating from the ventricular zone between weeks 8 and 20 of gestation; later disturbances in oligodendrocyte differentiation rarely contribute to adult migraine lesions. Normal white matter physiology involves saltatory conduction along myelinated axons, glial metabolic support via monocarboxylate transporters, and blood-brain barrier maintenance by astrocytic endfeet at microvessels. Related neurologic syndromes exhibiting WML include multiple sclerosis (confluent lesions, Dawson fingers), small vessel ischemia (lacunes, microbleeds), and systemic lupus erythematosus (antibody-mediated vasculopathy). Historically, WML in migraine were first reported in the 1980s with early CT scans showing hypodensities; MRI studies in the 1990s refined the description. Landmarks like the centrum semiovale, periventricular caps, and callosal-septal interface are clinically significant to distinguish benign migraine lesions from demyelinating plaques or vascular leukoaraiosis.","pathophysiology":"Migraine-associated white matter lesions are thought to result from transient oligemia and microvascular dysregulation rather than frank demyelination. Molecularly, cortical spreading depression (CSD) triggers waves of neuronal hyperpolarization followed by sustained depolarization, causing local nitric oxide release, increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, and transient blood-brain barrier permeability. Recurrent CSD episodes, particularly in aura-presenting migraineurs, may lead to subclinical endothelial injury and extravasation of plasma proteins, subsequently triggering microglial activation and minor myelin vacuolization. Genetic predisposition involves CACNA1A and ATP1A2 mutations in familial hemiplegic migraine, but common migraine has polygenic inheritance with over 40 loci identified in GWAS studies contributing ~38% heritability. Inflammatory mediators such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, and prostaglandin E2 potentiate vasodilation and nociceptive transmission via 5-HT1B/D receptor modulation. Energy metabolism demonstrates increased lactate production and mitochondrial dysfunction markers in white matter tracts after prolonged migraine burden. Over years, astrocytic and oligodendrocytic compensatory mechanisms, including upregulation of lactate shuttle pathways and remyelination attempts, manage minor injury, preventing progression to irreversible plaque formation. Time course: individual lesions appear stable in size (<3\u2009mm) and number, with <3% annual increase in total lesion volume documented over five-year serial imaging.","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine manifests in four phases: prodrome (up to 48\u2009hours; yawning, mood changes), aura (5\u201360 minutes; visual scintillations, paresthesias), headache phase (4\u201372\u2009hours untreated; unilateral throbbing, photophobia, phonophobia), and postdrome (24\u201348\u2009hours; fatigue, cognitive fog). Neurological examination between attacks is classically normal, with preserved cranial nerves, motor strength 5/5, intact reflexes, and normal coordination. In pediatric patients, aura is less common (<10%), and bilateral headache patterns occur in 40% of cases; elderly patients more often present with non-throbbing pressure. Women are affected threefold more than men, especially during reproductive years; hormonal fluctuations can trigger attacks 2\u20134\u2009days before menses. Systemic features include nausea (80%), vomiting (30%), osmophobia (50%). Severity is graded using MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment; score >20 severe) and HIT-6 (score \u226560 high impact). Red flags warranting further workup include sudden-onset maximal intensity headache, focal deficits, fever >38.5\u00b0C, and new headache in immunocompromised patients; absence of these confers >95% negative predictive value for secondary causes. Without treatment, migraine frequency may remain stable or slowly decline with age, but chronic migraine (\u226515 headache days/month) develops in ~3% of episodic cases annually if prophylaxis is not instituted.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with a detailed history and neurological exam to apply ICHD-3 criteria: at least five attacks lasting 4\u201372\u2009hours, unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate to severe pain intensity, aggravated by routine activity, plus nausea and/or photophobia/phonophobia. Sensitivity of clinical diagnosis is 90%, specificity 98%. Neuroimaging (brain MRI with T2/FLAIR, DWI, gadolinium sequences) is recommended only if red flags or atypical features are present (American Headache Society level A evidence). When performed, WML are small (<3\u2009mm), punctate, nonenhancing with no restricted diffusion or mass effect, distinguishing them from ischemic or demyelinating lesions. First-line laboratory tests to exclude secondary causes include CBC (normal WBC 4\u201311\u00d710^9/L), ESR (<20\u2009mm/hr), CRP (<5\u2009mg/L), metabolic panel (glucose 70\u2013100\u2009mg/dL, electrolytes normal). CSF analysis is reserved for suspected infection or subarachnoid hemorrhage; expected findings in migraine are normal opening pressure (10\u201315\u2009cm H2O), cell count <5\u2009cells/mm^3, protein 15\u201345\u2009mg/dL. Electrophysiological studies (VEP, BAEP) are unremarkable in migraine. Differential diagnoses include multiple sclerosis (periventricular Dawson fingers, oligoclonal bands positive in >90%), small vessel ischemic disease (clinical vascular risk factors, lacunes on CT), vasculitis (elevated ESR/CRP, vessel irregularities on angiography), and CADASIL (NOTCH3 gene mutation). Distinguishing features include lesion morphology, enhancement patterns, and laboratory markers.","management_principles":"Management of incidental migraine-related WML focuses on symptomatic relief and prevention of chronicity rather than addressing imaging findings. Acute treatment: oral sumatriptan 50\u2013100\u2009mg at onset, repeatable once after 2\u2009hours; SC sumatriptan 6\u2009mg for faster relief (pain freedom at two hours in 60% of patients). NSAIDs like naproxen 500\u2009mg offer 30% pain freedom at two hours. Prophylactic regimens are indicated when \u22654 migraine days per month or MIDAS score >11: propranolol starting 40\u2009mg BID, titrated up to 160\u2009mg/day; topiramate 25\u2009mg at bedtime, increasing by 25\u2009mg weekly to 100\u2009mg/day (divided BID). Second-line includes amitriptyline 10\u201330\u2009mg at bedtime or divalproex sodium initial 250\u2009mg BID, aiming for serum levels 50\u2013100\u2009\u00b5g/mL. CGRP monoclonal antibodies (erenumab 70\u2013140\u2009mg SC monthly) are third-line after failure of two prophylactics. Drug interactions: propranolol with calcium-channel blockers may cause bradycardia; topiramate enhances renal acid excretion, risk of nephrolithiasis. Nonpharmacologic: cognitive behavioral therapy reduces attack frequency by 30% (level B evidence), biofeedback yields 40% reduction over 12 weeks. Surgical decompression of occipital nerves is experimental and reserved for refractory occipital neuralgia. Monitor blood pressure, liver function tests every three months during prophylaxis. In pregnancy, avoid valproate and topiramate; prefer low-dose beta blockers. Adjust doses in renal impairment: reduce topiramate by 50% if creatinine clearance <50\u2009mL/min.","follow_up_guidelines":"Following reassurance, schedule follow-up at 3\u20136 weeks to assess headache diary and symptom progression. Monitor headache frequency, intensity (0\u201310 scale), and MIDAS/HIT-6 scores to evaluate disease burden. Repeat MRI is not indicated unless new red flags emerge; if present, perform MRI at a standard 1.5\u20133.0\u2009T with T2/FLAIR sequences within one month. Laboratory surveillance of metabolic and hematologic parameters is recommended every six months if prophylactic medication is initiated. Long-term complications include increased risk of ischemic stroke by 1.5-fold, especially in migraine with aura patients; counsel on cardiovascular risk factor modification. One-year prognosis studies show 50% reduction in attack frequency with treatment adherence; five-year follow-up indicates remission or significant improvement in 60% of patients. Rehabilitation encompassing physical therapy for cervical muscle tension and CBT for stress management should begin within three months for chronic cases. Counsel about safe driving: avoid driving during aura or within two hours of triptan administration. Provide patient education materials from the National Headache Foundation and direct to local support groups.","clinical_pearls":"1. Incidental white matter hyperintensities in migraine are common (20\u201350%) and typically benign. 2.

Hemicrania continua (D) is a continuous unilateral headache responsive to indomethacin, without discrete transient aura episodes. Large cohort studies (n>1,000) report aura in ~25% of migraineurs (Headache Classification Committee, 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is a primary headache disorder under ICD-11 8A80. Attacks last 4\u201372 hours, often unilateral and pulsatile, with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Aura\u2014transient focal neurological symptoms\u2014occurs in 20\u201330% of patients, most commonly visual scintillations or fortification spectra. Aura generally evolves over 5\u201360 minutes and resolves fully within 60 minutes. Differential includes TIA (sudden onset, vascular risk factors), occipital epilepsy (brief visual hallucinations), and retinal migraine (monocular visual loss). Genetics involve polygenic contributions, including SNPs in TRESK (KCNK18) and CACNA1A.","pathophysiology":"Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization, underlies aura by transiently reducing cortical blood flow by up to 30% over ~20 minutes, correlating with symptom duration. CSD activates trigeminovascular afferents, leading to release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, and neurokinin A, causing neurogenic inflammation and vasodilation. Trigeminal nucleus caudalis sensitization leads to central pain transmission. Estrogen fluctuations modulate CSD threshold, explaining female predominance.","clinical_manifestation":"Prodrome features (24\u201348 h before headache) include mood changes and fatigue.

CGRP monoclonal antibodies (erenumab 70\u2013140 mg/month) reduce monthly migraine days by 1.5 vs. placebo (NNT = 7).","follow_up_guidelines":"Maintain headache diary to monitor frequency and treatment response. Assess for medication overuse (>10 days/month for triptans or >15 days/month for NSAIDs). Reassess prophylaxis after 3\u20136 months; taper if \u226550% reduction in monthly migraine days is sustained.","clinical_pearls":"1. Aura evolves gradually over \u22655 min\u2014distinguishes from TIA. 2. Triptans contraindicated if aura accompanied by prolonged motor weakness (hemiplegic migraine). 3. CGRP antagonists offer targeted prevention without vascular effects. 4. Medication overuse headache often complicates frequent acute therapy. 5. Migraine improves during pregnancy for many women but may worsen postpartum.","references":"1. Headache Classification Committee IHS. ICHD-3. Cephalalgia. 2018;38(1):1\u2013211.\n2. Goadsby PJ et al.

Presence of trigger factors. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, severe, lancinating pain in the distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve, often triggered by specific stimuli such as swallowing, chewing, coughing, or talking. Multiple studies (e.g., Zakrzewska JM. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 1995;59(3):273\u2013277) document that identifying trigger factors is pivotal in establishing the diagnosis and differentiating it from other oropharyngeal pain syndromes. Options B, C, and D are less specific: family history of headaches (B) is not linked to glossopharyngeal neuralgia; previous surgeries (C) may be relevant if they involved the nerve region but are not universally inquired; medication history (D) is important in general neurology but does not specifically aid in diagnosing glossopharyngeal neuralgia.","conceptual_foundation":"Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is classified under cranial neuralgias in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3). It is a neuropathic pain disorder of the ninth cranial nerve, distinguished from trigeminal neuralgia by its anatomical distribution (posterior tongue, pharynx, tonsillar region, and ear) and unique triggers (swallowing, speaking). Differential diagnoses include Eagle syndrome, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and otitis media. Embryologically, the glossopharyngeal nerve arises from the third branchial arch; any developmental or compressive lesion along its cisternal segment or jugular foramen can mimic neuralgia. Neuroanatomically, the nerve\u2019s afferent fibers project to the spinal trigeminal nucleus, while efferent parasympathetic fibers target the parotid gland via the otic ganglion.","pathophysiology":"Normally, glossopharyngeal nerve fibers transmit gustatory and somatic sensations from the posterior third of the tongue and oropharynx. In glossopharyngeal neuralgia, focal demyelination\u2014often due to pulsatile vascular compression at the root entry zone\u2014results in ephaptic transmission and hyperexcitability. This leads to paroxysmal discharges in response to minimal stimuli. Vascular loops of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) are frequently implicated, as demonstrated in high-resolution imaging studies (Hall GC, Zakrzewska JM. Neurol Clin. 2004;22(2):331\u2013350).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically report brief (<2 minutes) episodes of intense, stabbing pain in the tonsillar fossa, base of tongue, or ear. Frequency can range from a few attacks per day to dozens. Triggers include swallowing, chewing, yawning, or talking. Pain may be accompanied by syncope or bradycardia due to concomitant vagal involvement. Between attacks, the exam is normal.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on ICHD-3 criteria: at least three attacks of unilateral pain in the glossopharyngeal distribution, triggered by stimuli, lasting seconds to minutes, and not accounted for by another disorder. A thorough history to elicit triggers is essential. MRI/MRA is recommended to exclude secondary causes in atypical presentations. No laboratory tests are diagnostic.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy is carbamazepine (200\u20131200 mg/day) or oxcarbazepine, with pain relief in 70\u201380% of patients. Alternatives include gabapentin, pregabalin, or lamotrigine. In refractory cases, microvascular decompression targeting the offending vascular loop yields long-term relief in over 90% of patients (Jannetta PJ. Neurosurgery. 1991;28(2):273\u201380).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored monthly for efficacy and side effects of antiepileptic medications, including hepatic function and blood counts. If surgery is performed, follow-up imaging may confirm decompression. Long-term follow-up every 6\u201312 months ensures continued symptom control and early detection of recurrence.","clinical_pearls":"1. Trigger zones in the tonsillar fossa are pathognomonic. 2. Carbamazepine response supports the diagnosis. 3. MRI/MRA is mandatory to rule out structural lesions. 4. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia can present with syncopal episodes due to vagal involvement. 5. Microvascular decompression offers definitive treatment in refractory cases.","references":"1. International Headache Society. The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition.
