The patient presents with proximal muscle weakness and cannot rise from a seated position, with a creatine kinase level of 1880. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Steroid myopathy","Statin myopathy"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Statin myopathy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Statin myopathy. The patient\u2019s proximal muscle weakness and markedly elevated CK (1880 IU/L) occurring in the setting of high-dose atorvastatin (40 mg) are characteristic of statin-associated myopathy. Steroid myopathy (Option A) typically presents with insidious proximal weakness and minimal or absent CK elevation, especially at low prednisone doses (5 mg). Statin myopathy often shows CK elevations >1000 IU/L and onset weeks to months after initiation or dose increase. No aspect of her presentation (on low-dose chronic steroid therapy) fits steroid myopathy, which also causes type II fiber atrophy without necrosis on biopsy. Thus, Option B is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Myopathies are categorized by etiology: inflammatory, metabolic, toxic, endocrine, genetic. Drug-induced myopathies include statin and steroid types. Statin myopathy ranges from myalgias with mild CK elevation to necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. ICD-11 code for statin myalgia is MD41.1. Steroid myopathy falls under endocrine myopathies (MD41.2) manifesting as painless weakness. Understanding pharmacologic mechanisms\u2014statin inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and steroids\u2019 proteolytic gene activation\u2014is fundamental. Differential includes polymyalgia rheumatica flare, dermatomyositis, and other drug-induced causes. Historical evolution: recognition of statin myopathy in the 1980s through RCTs of lovastatin and subsequent case series.","pathophysiology":"Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, reducing mevalonate and downstream isoprenoids necessary for mitochondrial function and coenzyme Q10 synthesis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species, and muscle fiber necrosis. Genetic predisposition (SLCO1B1 polymorphisms) increases myopathy risk (OR 4.5). Muscle pathology shows necrotic fibers with macrophage infiltration. In contrast, steroid myopathy involves glucocorticoid receptor-mediated upregulation of muscle atrophy F-box ubiquitin ligase (MuRF1), causing type II fiber atrophy without CK rise. Temporal progression: statin myopathy arises weeks to years after starting therapy, steroid myopathy develops insidiously over months at high steroid doses (>20 mg/day) but is unlikely at 5 mg.","clinical_manifestation":"Statin myopathy presents with symmetric proximal muscle pain and weakness, commonly in hip and shoulder girdles, and CK levels often >10\u00d7 upper limit of normal. Incidence of myalgia is ~5% and myopathy ~0.1% in high-dose statin trials (Pitt B et al., JAMA 2019). Onset usually 6 months after initiation or uptitration. Steroid myopathy produces painless weakness, predominantly proximal, and normal CK. In untreated statin myopathy, persistent necrosis can lead to permanent weakness and rhabdomyolysis. Special populations (elderly, renal impairment) have higher risk.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation: review medication history, exam for proximal weakness, serum CK. CK sensitivity for statin myopathy ~90% when >3\u00d7 ULN. Pretest probability in a patient on high-dose statin with weakness is ~70%; CK elevation increases post-test probability to >95%. Second-tier: EMG shows myopathic potentials in >80% of cases. Third-tier: muscle biopsy reserved for suspected necrotizing autoimmune myopathy\u2014shows necrosis with MHC-I upregulation. Genetic testing for SLCO1B1 variants may be considered. Ruling out steroid myopathy relies on lack of CK elevation and biopsy showing type II atrophy.","management_principles":"Statin myopathy management involves discontinuing statin, switching to lower-dose or alternative (e.g., pravastatin), or non-statin lipid-lowering agents (e.g., ezetimibe). CoQ10 supplementation (200 mg/day) may alleviate symptoms (meta-analysis OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1\u20132.9). If CK >1000 IU/L, hold statin until resolution. Steroid dose reduction would not improve steroid myopathy at 5 mg. First-tier: discontinue offending agent. Second-tier: re-challenge with hydrophilic statin. Third-tier: evaluate for autoimmune necrotizing myopathy\u2014immunosuppressants if autoantibodies present. Physical therapy for strength recovery.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor CK every 2 weeks during statin re-challenge, then monthly for 3 months, then quarterly. Reassess muscle strength at each visit. If persistent symptoms, obtain EMG or biopsy. Long-term lipid monitoring to maintain LDL targets. Educate patients on reporting myalgias promptly. Transition to shared care with primary physician once stable. Document myopathy event in medical record to avoid future high-dose statin exposure.","clinical_pearls":"1. Statin myopathy often presents with CK >10\u00d7 ULN; steroid myopathy has normal CK. 2. SLCO1B1 genotype testing identifies high-risk individuals for statin toxicity. 3. CoQ10 supplementation may reduce statin-associated muscle symptoms. 4. Hydrophilic statins (pravastatin, fluvastatin) have lower myopathy risk. 5.

Elevated CK levels (>1800 U/L), EMG showing fibrillations and reduced MUAP amplitudes, and proximal muscle weakness in a patient on statin therapy are consistent with statin-associated necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (SANAM). Steroid-induced myopathy typically presents with proximal weakness but normal or mildly elevated CK and EMG showing small, brief MUAPs without spontaneous activity (Amato AA, et al.

Statin\u2010induced myopathy is a well\u2010recognized adverse effect of HMG\u2010CoA reductase inhibitors, especially at higher doses (atorvastatin 40 mg). The patient\u2019s presentation of proximal muscle weakness and a creatine kinase (CK) level of 1,880 IU/L (approximately 10\u00d7 upper limit of normal) is classic for statin\u2010associated myopathy. Steroid\u2010induced myopathy typically occurs with higher glucocorticoid doses (>20 mg prednisone equivalent daily) over prolonged periods and presents with normal to mildly elevated CK levels. Thus option A (stop steroid) is incorrect because the patient is on a low maintenance dose (5 mg), making steroid myopathy highly unlikely. In contrast, discontinuation of the offending statin leads to rapid symptom improvement in most cases (up to 90% symptom resolution within 6 weeks).","conceptual_foundation":"Statin myopathy fits within ICD-11 code 8E43.00 (drug\u2010induced myopathy) and is classified under toxic myopathies. HMG\u2010CoA reductase inhibitors reduce cholesterol synthesis but can disrupt muscle cell membrane integrity via depletion of isoprenoids and coenzyme Q10. Differential diagnoses include inflammatory myopathies (e.g., polymyositis), endocrine myopathies (thyroid disease), and metabolic myopathies (McArdle disease). Historically, statin myopathy was first described in the 1980s after lovastatin approval. Muscle biopsy shows fiber necrosis without significant inflammation. Genetic predisposition (SLCO1B1 polymorphisms) increases risk.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle cells rely on mevalonate pathway products (cholesterol, ubiquinone) for mitochondrial electron transport and membrane stabilization. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, lowering ubiquinone (CoQ10) synthesis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species, and myocyte apoptosis. These changes cause membrane leakage and CK release. Low\u2010dose glucocorticoids predominantly cause protein catabolism and type II fiber atrophy, but dose and duration here are insufficient to produce significant myopathy. The temporal correlation between statin dose and symptom onset (usually weeks to months) supports statin myopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically develop symmetric proximal weakness, difficulty rising from chairs or climbing stairs, and myalgias. CK elevations range from mild (2\u20135\u00d7 ULN) to severe rhabdomyolysis (>10\u00d7 ULN). Onset usually occurs within months of dose initiation or escalation. Untreated, severe rhabdomyolysis may lead to acute kidney injury.

CK >10\u00d7 ULN in the setting of statin use strongly suggests statin myopathy (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~85%). Exclude other causes with TSH, ANA, ESR/CRP, and EMG if unclear. Muscle biopsy is reserved for atypical or persistent cases. Discontinuation of statin followed by CK re\u2010measurement (2\u20134 weeks) confirms diagnosis if CK normalizes and symptoms resolve.","management_principles":"Immediate discontinuation of statin leads to symptom resolution in >90% of cases. Alternative lipid-lowering strategies include lower\u2010dose hydrophilic statins (pravastatin, rosuvastatin) or non\u2010statin agents (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors). CoQ10 supplementation has limited evidence but may be tried. Glucocorticoid dose adjustment is unnecessary given the low dose.

Statin myopathy risk increases with high\u2010dose therapy and interacting drugs (e.g., fibrates, certain antibiotics). 2. Low\u2010dose prednisone (\u22645 mg) rarely causes myopathy; suspect statins first. 3. CK >10\u00d7 ULN in a statin user is diagnostic of statin myopathy until proven otherwise. 4.

Infiltrating plexopathy occurs when tumor cells invade nerve roots and trunks, causing axonal disruption, Wallerian degeneration, and intense inflammatory mediator release, resulting in severe neuropathic pain. Tumor-associated macrophage infiltration further propagates cytokine-mediated nociception. Imaging shows nodular or diffuse enhancement of plexus segments invaded by tumor.","clinical_manifestation":"Infiltrating plexopathy presents with severe, lancinating neuropathic pain radiating along nerve distributions, often preceding weakness.
