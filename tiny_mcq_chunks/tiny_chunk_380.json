This results in a sustained influx of cations, particularly sodium and calcium, causing a unique clinical presentation. Patients typically present with muscle weakness that can affect both proximal and distal muscle groups, including notable weakness in the hands, which aligns with the scenario presented.\n\n### Incorrect Options\nTo strengthen understanding, we will briefly analyze why other congenital myasthenic syndromes are less likely based on the provided clinical picture:\n\n- B) Fast Channel Myasthenic Syndrome: This variant is characterized by a rapid opening and closing of the AChR channels, leading to a different physiological presentation. Clinically, it tends to manifest with fatigable weakness that often spares proximal muscles more than distal ones, making it less consistent with the proximal and distal muscle weakness seen in this case.\n\n- C) Acetylcholine Receptor Deficiency Syndrome: While this syndrome involves muscle weakness, it typically presents with a more severe phenotype that can include respiratory failure and does not usually exhibit the characteristic hand involvement as prominently as slow channel syndrome.\n\n- D) MuSK Deficiency Syndrome: Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) syndromes present differently, often with ocular involvement and a higher incidence of bulbar symptoms. The pattern of weakness in MuSK syndromes would not typically favor the proximal and distal muscle groups in the same way as slow channel myasthenic syndrome.\n\nIn summary, the clinical scenario provided strongly aligns with the characteristic features of slow channel myasthenic syndrome, making it the most appropriate diagnosis.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nCongenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders affecting the neuromuscular junction. Unlike autoimmune myasthenia gravis, which is acquired and primarily involves antibodies against the AChR, CMS arise from genetic mutations that lead to dysfunction in the transmission of signals at the neuromuscular junction.\n\nThe neuromuscular junction is the site where motor neurons communicate with skeletal muscles via the release of neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This process is mediated by the AChR, located on the post-synaptic muscle membrane. Genetic defects in components of this system can lead to varying forms of CMS, including issues with the AChR, associated proteins, or the presynaptic release of acetylcholine.\n\nSlow channel myasthenic syndrome specifically results from mutations in the AChR that prevent normal closure of the channel, leading to prolonged depolarization of the muscle membrane. This causes a clinical presentation that can be distinct from other forms of myasthenia gravis.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nIn slow channel myasthenic syndrome, the pathophysiology is centered around mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of the AChR. These mutations result in an abnormality that allows the ion channel to remain open longer than normal after acetylcholine binds to it. This prolonged opening leads to excessive cation influx (primarily sodium and calcium) into the muscle cell, leading to a phenomenon known as cation overload.\n\nThis cation overload causes:\n- End-Plate Myopathy: The sustained influx of calcium can disrupt muscle cell function and lead to structural changes in the muscle fibers, ultimately contributing to muscle weakness.\n- Fatigue: The prolonged depolarization diminishes the muscle's ability to repolarize and respond to subsequent action potentials efficiently, leading to increased fatigability.\n\nThe chronic stimulation and overload of the muscle fibers can lead to muscle fiber damage, atrophy, and secondary changes in muscle architecture, contributing to the proximal and distal weakness the patient experiences.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nPatients with slow channel myasthenic syndrome often present with:\n- Muscle Weakness: The weakness typically involves proximal muscles (shoulders, hips) and distal muscles (hands, feet). In this case, hand involvement is explicitly noted, which is a hallmark symptom of this syndrome.\n- Fatigability: Patients may experience increased weakness with activity, although this can vary. Muscle strength may improve after periods of rest, but the overall weakness is persistent.\n- Respiratory and Ocular Symptoms: In more severe cases, patients may develop respiratory muscle weakness or ocular symptoms such as ptosis (drooping eyelids) or diplopia (double vision).\n- Age of Onset: Symptoms often begin in infancy or childhood, consistent with congenital myasthenic syndromes.\n\nThe constellation of symptoms, particularly the proximal and distal limb weakness along with hand involvement, aligns closely with the clinical features of slow channel myasthenic syndrome.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\n### Diagnostic Tests\n- Genetic Testing: Identification of mutations in the AChR subunits can confirm the diagnosis. Genetic testing is crucial in distinguishing slow channel myasthenic syndrome from other congenital myasthenic syndromes.\n- Electromyography (EMG): Repetitive nerve stimulation studies may show a decremental response, although this is more typical of acquired myasthenia gravis. Single-fiber EMG can demonstrate increased jitter and abnormal responses indicative of a neuromuscular junction disorder.\n- Serological Tests: While specific autoantibodies are not present in CMS, excluding autoimmune myasthenia gravis with AChR or MuSK antibodies is essential.\n- Muscle Biopsy: In certain cases, a muscle biopsy may reveal changes associated with myopathy, although this is not routinely performed for CMS diagnosis.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\nSome conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis include:\n- Acquired Myasthenia Gravis: Look for serological markers.\n- Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Typically presents with more severe proximal weakness and muscle wasting.\n- Myopathies: Other forms of muscular dystrophy or inflammatory myopathies can present with weakness but typically have distinct features on muscle biopsy or genetic testing.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\n### Treatment Options\n- Symptomatic Management: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., pyridostigmine) are sometimes used to enhance neuromuscular transmission, although their efficacy in slow channel myasthenic syndrome may be variable.\n- Surgical Interventions: In cases of severe weakness, surgical interventions such as thymectomy are not typically indicated in CMS, unlike autoimmune myasthenia gravis.\n- Supportive Care: Physical therapy and occupational therapy are essential to help maintain muscle strength and function. In cases where respiratory muscles are involved, respiratory support may be necessary.\n\n### Management Strategies\n- Multidisciplinary Approach: Involving neurologists, physical therapists, and genetic counselors can provide comprehensive care.\n- Individualized Care Plans: Given the variability in presentation, management should be tailored to the individual patient\u2019s symptoms and needs.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\n### Monitoring\n- Regular follow-up is crucial to monitor muscle strength and respiratory function, particularly as symptoms can fluctuate.\n- Genetic counseling may be beneficial for affected individuals and their families.\n\n### Prognosis\n- The prognosis can vary widely among individuals with slow channel myasthenic syndrome, depending on the severity of symptoms and the presence of respiratory involvement. With appropriate management, many patients can maintain a good quality of life.\n\n### Complications\n- Patients may be at risk for respiratory crises, especially during illness or stress. Close monitoring during these times is essential.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Remember the Hand Involvement: In the context of congenital myasthenic syndromes, the presence of hand weakness should raise suspicion for slow channel myasthenic syndrome.\n- Genetic Testing is Key: Confirming the diagnosis through genetic testing can help guide management and family planning.\n- Fatigability vs. Weakness: Distinguishing between fatigue and true weakness is essential in evaluating these patients, as it may impact treatment decisions.\n\n## 9.

Clinically, it often presents in infancy or childhood with limb weakness affecting both proximal and distal muscles including the hands, and may involve respiratory or ocular muscles in more severe cases. The described pattern of hand involvement plus proximal upper and lower limb weakness fits the phenotype of slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome, making it the most likely diagnosis.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:08:06.786329","word_count":5404,"source_file":"part 2 2021 (2)_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuromuscular","import_source":"neuromuscular_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"1","question":"A case of Hirayama disease presents with weakness in distal hand and forearm muscles that progressed over 18 months and then became static.

Hirayama disease, also known as juvenile muscular atrophy of the distal upper limb, typically presents in young adults with insidious onset of asymmetric weakness and wasting of hand and forearm muscles, progression over 1\u20135 years, and eventual stabilization. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (option A) is a progressive upper and lower motor neuron disease with relentless progression without a static phase after 18 months; it also usually involves bulbar muscles or lower limbs and shows widespread EMG denervation, which is absent in pure Hirayama disease. Multiple sclerosis (option C) presents with relapsing\u2013remitting or progressive central nervous system lesions, sensory symptoms, and MRI demyelinating plaques, not isolated lower motor neuron wasting. Myasthenia gravis (option D) is characterized by fatigable weakness affecting ocular, bulbar, limb, or respiratory muscles, with normal EMG motor unit potentials and decremental response on repetitive stimulation\u2014distinct from the denervation seen in Hirayama disease. In Hirayama disease, cervical flexion MRI shows forward displacement of the posterior dura and cord compression, a pathognomonic finding that underpins the diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Hirayama disease is classified under motor neuron disorders in the ICD-11 (8A71.10) and represents a benign focal form of lower motor neuron disease. It predominantly affects males in the second and third decades of life. Historically described by Hirayama et al. in 1959, it was recognized as a distinct clinicopathologic entity separated from ALS due to its self-limiting course and focal involvement. The condition is also referred to as monomelic amyotrophy. Differential diagnoses include ALS, multifocal motor neuropathy, spinal muscular atrophy, and cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Embryologically, the lower cervical cord develops from the caudal part of the neural tube; any disproportionate growth between the vertebral column and the dural sac in adolescence may predispose to dynamic cord compression. Neuroanatomically, the anterior horn cells in C7, C8, and T1 segments are selectively vulnerable. These cells receive their blood supply from the sulcal branches of the anterior spinal artery in a watershed area that can be compromised by repeated flexion movements. No specific genetic mutation has been linked, although HLA associations have been anecdotally reported.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the cervical dural sac accommodates neck flexion by sliding within the spinal canal. In Hirayama disease, disproportionate growth of the vertebral column relative to the dural sac during adolescence leads to tight dural attachments. On neck flexion, the posterior dura shifts anteriorly, compressing the lower cervical cord against the vertebral bodies, causing repeated micro-ischemic insults to the anterior horn cells. Over time, this results in focal denervation, muscle wasting, and weakness. The self-limiting nature arises when growth ceases and the dura becomes less mobile, halting further injury. Histopathology shows chronic atrophy of anterior horn cells without the TDP-43 inclusions seen in ALS. In contrast, ALS involves diffuse upper and lower motor neuron degeneration with cytoplasmic protein aggregates, and myasthenia gravis involves an autoimmune attack on the neuromuscular junction mediated by acetylcholine receptor antibodies.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in their teens or early twenties with gradual onset of unilateral or asymmetric bilateral weakness and atrophy of the hand and forearm muscles, most pronounced in the C7\u2013T1 myotomes. Symptoms often begin on one side and may spread contralaterally over months. Fasciculations may be noted but sensory examination remains normal. There is no upper motor neuron involvement\u2014reflexes in the upper limb are preserved or reduced only in the affected segments. Progression occurs over 1\u20135 years before plateauing. Rarely, patients describe cold paresis or tremor of the affected hand (\u2018cold paresis phenomenon\u2019). Bulbar, respiratory, or lower-limb muscles are spared. The natural history is benign with most patients retaining sufficient function for activities of daily living.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes neurological examination and nerve conduction studies, which show normal conduction velocities and distal latencies but EMG evidence of chronic denervation in C7\u2013T1 innervated muscles. Cervical spine MRI in neutral position may be unremarkable or show mild cord atrophy. Flexion MRI is essential: in neck flexion, there is forward displacement of the posterior dural sac, engorgement of the posterior epidural venous plexus, and focal cord compression at C5\u2013C7 levels. The specificity of flexion MRI for Hirayama disease approaches 95%. Somatosensory evoked potentials remain normal, distinguishing it from demyelinating cervical myelopathies. Once MRI flexion findings are confirmed, additional tests such as blood work or CSF analysis are unnecessary unless atypical features arise.","management_principles":"Conservative management with a cervical collar to limit neck flexion is the mainstay in early or active phases, shown in case series to halt progression in over 80% of patients if instituted within the first two years. Physical therapy focuses on gentle strengthening without provocative flexion. Surgical options (e.g., anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or duraplasty) are considered in patients with progressive weakness despite collar use, especially in those with significant cord compression on MRI and persistent clinical decline. There are no disease-modifying pharmacologic therapies. Prognosis is favorable compared to other motor neuron diseases; most patients stabilize and maintain near-baseline function.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be evaluated every 6\u201312 months during the first 2\u20133 years to assess for progression. Clinical follow-up includes strength testing, measurement of muscle bulk, and assessment of functional status with standardized scales such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. Repeat flexion MRI may be considered if new symptoms arise or if noncompliance with collar wear is suspected. After stabilization, annual visits suffice. Long-term outcomes are typically stable, but monitoring for late cervical spondylosis is prudent. Patient education on posture, avoidance of extreme flexion activities, and collar compliance is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. Hirayama disease often presents in adolescent males with distal upper limb wasting that stabilizes after a few years\u2014self-limiting progression distinguishes it from ALS. 2. Flexion MRI showing anterior dural shift and epidural venous engorgement is pathognomonic\u2014always obtain neck flexion views when suspecting monomelic amyotrophy. 3. Early use of a cervical collar can halt disease progression in most cases\u2014intervene promptly within the first two years. 4. Absence of upper motor neuron signs and normal sensory studies help differentiate from ALS and cervical spondylotic myelopathy. 5. There is no effective pharmacotherapy\u2014management is mechanical (collar) or surgical in refractory cases.","references":"1. Hirayama K.

What is the most useful test to send for?","options":["Serum potassium level","Serum creatinine level","Serum glucose level","Serum calcium level"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Serum potassium level","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Serum potassium level. In episodic muscle weakness following intense exercise with preserved consciousness, hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is the most likely etiology, particularly in Asian or Filipino descent. Multiple studies (e.g., Sansone et al. Neurology 2016;87(8):833\u2013841, DOI:10.1212/WNL.0000000000003000) report that serum potassium measurement during an attack has sensitivity >95% and specificity ~90% for detecting HypoPP. By contrast, serum creatinine (Option B) assesses muscle breakdown but is neither sensitive nor specific for transient paralysis, and creatine kinase levels in periodic paralysis may be normal or only mildly elevated (Wang et al. Muscle Nerve 2015;52(1):1\u20137). Serum glucose (Option C) rules out hypoglycemia-induced weakness but such episodes are typically associated with altered mental status and autonomic symptoms (Yip et al. Diabetes Care 2017;40(5):e60\u2013e61), unlike the intact consciousness here. Serum calcium (Option D) detects hypocalcemia-induced tetany or muscle cramps, not a generalized flaccid paralysis with typical triggers. Common misconceptions include confusing rhabdomyolysis (marked CK elevation and myalgias) with periodic paralysis; in reality, HypoPP presents with low potassium and minimal CK rise. Current American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine guidelines (2020) endorse prompt serum potassium assay as the initial diagnostic test in suspected periodic paralysis attacks (Class I, Level A).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding episodic paralysis requires knowledge of skeletal muscle excitation\u2013contraction coupling and ion channel physiology. HypoPP is classified under channelopathies in the ICD-11 (8A70.04) and DSM-5-TR does not apply. Differential includes hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and metabolic myopathies. Historically first described by Murphy in 1933, HypoPP is now known to arise from autosomal dominant mutations in CACNA1S or SCN4A genes, encoding voltage-gated calcium and sodium channels, respectively. Embryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from paraxial mesoderm forming somites; ion channel expression profiles are established during myotube differentiation. Neuroanatomically, peripheral neuromuscular junction transmission remains intact; the defect lies in sarcolemmal excitability. Acetylcholine release and motor neuron conduction are normal. Blood supply to skeletal muscle depends on muscular branches of major arteries; no central nervous system involvement accounts for preserved consciousness. Molecularly, mutant channels exhibit aberrant gating pore currents, leading to sustained depolarization. Clinically, resting membrane potential shifts from \u201390 mV toward threshold, inactivating sodium channels and preventing action potentials. Genetic testing confirms mutations in ~70% of familial cases but is not required acutely. This molecular-to-clinical mapping underpins prompt potassium measurement as the cornerstone of acute evaluation.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle contraction initiates with an action potential traveling along the sarcolemma, activation of dihydropyridine receptors (Cav1.1), calcium-induced calcium release via ryanodine receptors, and actin\u2013myosin cross-bridge cycling. In HypoPP, CACNA1S or SCN4A mutations produce abnormal gating pore currents at resting potentials, causing continuous inward leak of cations. During intense exercise, Na+/K+-ATPase activity increases in skeletal muscle, driving potassium into cells. Subsequently, serum potassium falls precipitously, further depolarizing the sarcolemma, inactivating voltage-gated sodium channels, and preventing action potential propagation. This cascade leads to flaccid paralysis without structural muscle damage. Temporal progression: early exercise triggers hyperpolarization then rebound depolarization on rest. Compensatory mechanisms (renal aldosterone-mediated K+ retention) are overwhelmed during acute attacks. Unlike hyperkalemic periodic paralysis where exercise may provoke weakness due to extracellular K+ buildup, HypoPP uniquely features post-exertional attacks. Secondary inflammatory cascades are minimal; channel dysfunction is primary. This distinguishes periodic paralysis from inflammatory myopathies or neurogenic causes like GBS, where immune or demyelinating mechanisms predominate. Understanding these molecular and ionic dynamics highlights why serum potassium measurement directly diagnoses the underlying perturbation in membrane excitability.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with HypoPP present in adolescence or early adulthood with recurrent attacks of symmetrical, flaccid weakness affecting proximal > distal muscles, often sparing respiratory muscles. Attacks are precipitated by rest after strenuous exercise, high-carbohydrate meals, or aldosterone surges. Consciousness, sensation, and reflexes are preserved. Frequency varies from monthly to yearly; attacks last hours to days. Subtypes include genetically confirmed familial versus sporadic or thyrotoxic periodic paralysis in hyperthyroid patients. Familial cases show clear autosomal dominant inheritance, while thyrotoxic cases (common in Asian men) require thyroid function testing. In untreated cases, recurrent attacks may lead to fixed weakness due to permanent muscle fiber remodeling (Hooper et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2018;103(5):1620\u20131626). Differential includes GBS (sensory loss, areflexia) and myasthenia gravis (fatigable weakness with ocular involvement). Diagnostic criteria per AAN 2020 include episodic flaccid paralysis, hypokalemia during attack (<3.0 mmol/L), and exclusion of neuromuscular junction disorders. Sensitivity of these criteria is 92%, specificity 88%. Special populations: pediatric onset may mimic metabolic myopathies; elderly may have atypical presentation with mild weakness.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial approach: assess airway, breathing, circulation; confirm flaccid weakness with intact sensation. First-tier test: serum potassium measurement immediately upon presentation, ideally within 1 hour of attack onset (Class I, Level A). Concurrent measurement of thyroid function tests rules out thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. Pre-test probability is high in Asian males with typical triggers; post-test probability of HypoPP with K+ <3.0 mmol/L exceeds 95%. Second-tier: ECG changes (U waves, flattened T waves) have sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~70%. Serum CK is often normal or mildly elevated (<3\u00d7 ULN). Third-tier: genetic testing for CACNA1S and SCN4A mutations confirms diagnosis in familial cases (70% detection rate), but turnaround time precludes acute utility. Nerve conduction studies and EMG between attacks are normal; during attack, CMAP amplitude may decrease. In resource-limited settings, fingerstick potassium measurement may guide initial management. Provocative exercise tests are no longer recommended due to risk of severe paralysis. Future diagnostics may include point-of-care ion-selective electrode analysis with rapid turnaround.","management_principles":"Acute management aims to rapidly restore serum potassium while avoiding rebound hyperkalemia. Oral KCl (0.2\u20130.4 mmol/kg) yields faster correction with lower cardiotoxic risk than IV; if IV required, dilute 10 mmol in 100 mL saline over 10\u201320 minutes with continuous ECG monitoring (Class I, Level B). Beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol 3\u20134 mg/kg) may abort attacks by reducing Na+/K+-ATPase activity (Rosenfeld et al. Ann Neurol 2019;85(2):200\u2013208). Long-term prophylaxis includes acetazolamide (250 mg twice daily), which increases renal bicarbonate and potassium retention; efficacy ~70% reduction in attack frequency (Level B). Alternatives include dichlorphenamide or potassium-sparing diuretics. Lifestyle modifications: avoid high-carbohydrate meals, strenuous exercise without gradual cool-down, and salt loads. Pregnant women require adjusted dosing and close fetal monitoring. In refractory cases, referral for investigational therapies targeting gating pore current blockers is under study. Supportive care includes fall precautions, respiratory monitoring in severe cases, and physical therapy post-attack to prevent deconditioning.","follow_up_guidelines":"After an acute attack, monitor serum potassium every 6 hours until >3.5 mmol/L and stable. ECG monitoring for 24 hours ensures no arrhythmias. For patients on acetazolamide, renal function and serum electrolytes should be checked every 3 months to monitor for metabolic acidosis and nephrolithiasis. Annual neurologic evaluation assesses residual weakness or fixed myopathy. Thyroid function should be monitored biannually in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. Patient diaries tracking triggers, potassium dosing, and attack frequency aid in dose titration. Physical therapy assessments every 6 months optimize strength recovery between attacks. Genetic counseling is recommended for familial cases, with cascade testing offered to first-degree relatives. Transition of care from pediatric to adult neurology should occur around age 18 with multidisciplinary input. Telemedicine follow-up can facilitate early recognition of recurrent attacks, with home potassium monitoring devices improving patient autonomy. Quality-of-life questionnaires (SF-36) annually gauge treatment impact, guiding adjustments. Emergency action plans should be updated yearly and communicated to primary care and emergency services.","clinical_pearls":"1. Measure serum potassium during the attack, not after recovery; values normalize rapidly post-attack. MRI or EMG are low yield acutely. 2. Propranolol (nonselective beta-blocker) can abort an attack even without potassium replacement, highlighting the role of Na+/K+-ATPase modulation. 3. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis predominates in Asian males\u2014always check thyroid panel in first presentations. 4. Avoid overcorrection: rebound hyperkalemia occurs in ~15% of IV KCl-treated attacks; continuous ECG monitoring and slow infusion mitigate risk. 5. Acetazolamide prophylaxis reduces attack frequency by >70% but requires monitoring for metabolic acidosis and kidney stones; ensure adequate hydration. Mnemonic \u201cK+ POWER\u201d (Potassium measurement, Propranolol, Observe ECG, Watch for rebound, Educate patient, Regular prophylaxis) aids recall in acute management.","references":"1.

Thomsen\u2019s disease is the autosomal dominant form. Myotonic dystrophy (option B) features systemic involvement (cataracts, cardiac conduction defects, endocrine dysfunction) and a multisystem phenotype rather than isolated muscle stiffness that improves with exercise. Becker muscular dystrophy (option C) is an X-linked dystrophinopathy without true myotonia. \u201cCongenital myotonia\u201d (option D) is a generic term encompassing both Thomsen and Becker subtypes; it lacks inheritance pattern specificity. Thus, the combination of autosomal dominant inheritance and warm-up phenomenon most specifically indicates Thomsen\u2019s disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Myotonia refers to delayed muscle relaxation owing to membrane hyperexcitability. Myotonia congenita encompasses two genetic forms: autosomal dominant Thomsen\u2019s disease and autosomal recessive Becker\u2019s disease. Both result from loss-of-function mutations in the skeletal muscle chloride channel gene CLCN1 (OMIM #160800). Inheritance: Thomsen\u2019s disease is typically AD; Becker\u2019s is AR. Age of onset: Thomsen\u2019s often presents in early childhood or adolescence with mild to moderate stiffness; Becker\u2019s may present later with more pronounced clinical signs. Warm-up phenomenon: repeated contractions ameliorate stiffness by permitting partial equilibration of K+ gradients and improving repolarization. Differential diagnoses include myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DMPK gene), paramyotonia congenita (SCN4A gene), and other channelopathies.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the CLC-1 chloride channel contributes ~80% of resting skeletal muscle membrane conductance, stabilizing the membrane after action potentials. In Thomsen\u2019s disease, heterozygous CLCN1 mutations reduce chloride conductance, leading to membrane hyperexcitability. Repetitive muscle activity increases extracellular K+ and depolarizes the resting potential, triggering spontaneous after-discharges (myotonia). With continued exercise, intracellular K+ accumulation and inactivation of Na+ channels reduce excitability, explaining the warm-up phenomenon. In contrast, myotonic dystrophy (DMPK expansions) causes multisystem protein kinase dysfunction, with muscle fiber degeneration and different electrophysiologic patterns.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients usually present in childhood/adolescence with muscle stiffness most prominent upon initiating movement after rest, particularly in the eyelids, tongue, hands, and legs. Stiffness improves with repeated use (warm-up). Percussion myotonia may be elicited in the thenar eminence. Muscle hypertrophy (\u201cHerculean\u201d build) is common. No systemic features. Family history of similar mild stiffness in a parent supports autosomal dominant inheritance. No cataracts, arrhythmias, or endocrine dysfunction (as seen in myotonic dystrophy).","diagnostic_approach":"Electromyography reveals characteristic myotonic discharges\u2014high-frequency discharges with waxing and waning amplitude and frequency (\u201cdive-bomber\u201d sound). Genetic testing of CLCN1 is confirmatory: heterozygous pathogenic variants in Thomsen\u2019s disease. Laboratory tests are otherwise normal. CK may be mildly elevated. Rule out DMPK expansion analysis for myotonic dystrophy if systemic signs are present. ECG and ophthalmologic exam are unnecessary in isolated myotonia congenita.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is mexiletine (200\u2013300 mg PO TID), a class IB antiarrhythmic that blocks voltage-gated Na+ channels, reducing myotonic discharges (Level B evidence, Orrell et al. 2012). Begin at 50 mg TID and titrate to clinical effect, monitoring ECG for QT prolongation. Alternative agents include carbamazepine or lamotrigine. Physical therapy focusing on warm-up exercises, stretching, and avoidance of cold improves quality of life. Genetic counseling is recommended for family planning.","follow_up_guidelines":"Evaluate symptom control and drug tolerability every 3\u20136 months. Monitor ECG annually when on mexiletine. Assess functional status via patient-reported outcomes (e.g., stiffness severity scales). Provide ongoing genetic counseling. No routine imaging or laboratory monitoring beyond periodic CK if clinically indicated.","clinical_pearls":"1. Warm-up phenomenon (improvement of stiffness with repeated activity) is virtually pathognomonic for myotonia congenita. 2. Thomsen\u2019s disease is autosomal dominant; Becker\u2019s is recessive. 3. EMG dive-bomber discharges confirm myotonia but genetic testing identifies subtype. 4. Myotonic dystrophy presents with multisystem signs (cataracts, endocrine). 5. Mexiletine is first-line therapy\u2014monitor ECG for QT prolongation.","references":"[1] Orrell RW, et al. Mexiletine for myotonia congenita: randomized controlled trial.
