What is the treatment?","options":["Praziquantel"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Praziquantel","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Praziquantel. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for schistosomal infections, including neuroschistosomiasis. It acts by increasing the permeability of the schistosome tegument to calcium ions, causing spastic paralysis and dislodgement of the parasite. No other agents are indicated for schistosomal CNS disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Schistosomiasis is a helminthic infection caused by trematodes of the genus Schistosoma. Neuroschistosomiasis occurs when eggs or adult worms lodge in the central nervous system, inciting a granulomatous inflammatory response. Diagnosis relies on CSF eosinophilia, imaging findings, and serologies.","pathophysiology":"Schistosoma eggs embolize to the CNS vasculature, triggering a Th2\u2010mediated immune response with eosinophil recruitment. Granuloma formation around eggs leads to focal inflammation, edema, and occasionally mass\u2010like lesions. Parenchymal involvement produces seizures and focal deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Neuroschistosomiasis often presents subacutely with headache, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis with eosinophils, elevated protein, and normal to low glucose. Spinal cord involvement leads to myelopathy.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, CSF eosinophilia, serologic tests (ELISA), and MRI showing enhancing granulomatous lesions. Stool and urine microscopy may demonstrate eggs. Biopsy of lesions is rarely required.","management_principles":"Praziquantel at 20 mg/kg orally three times daily for 1\u20132 days is standard. Adjunctive corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) reduce inflammation and prevent paradoxical worsening. Antiepileptic drugs are used for seizure control.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow neurologic status and repeat MRI in 4\u20136 weeks. Monitor for clinical improvement and resolution of CSF eosinophilia. Taper steroids over several weeks to prevent rebound inflammation.","clinical_pearls":"1. CSF eosinophilia is highly suggestive of neuroschistosomiasis in endemic areas. 2. Always co\u2010administer steroids with praziquantel in CNS involvement. 3.

Neurobrucellosis requires combination antimicrobial therapy that includes an agent with excellent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration. Among the two options presented, ceftriaxone is the preferred agent due to its high CSF levels when given intravenously (mean CSF concentration ~25\u201335% of serum levels), and its bactericidal activity against Brucella spp. (Colmenero et al. J Neurol Sci 1994;124(2): 123\u2013130, PMID: 7600689). Randomized trials and prospective case series have demonstrated better neurological outcomes and lower relapse rates when ceftriaxone is used as part of a triple regimen (doxycycline + rifampin + ceftriaxone) for at least six weeks, compared with regimens lacking ceftriaxone (Erdem et al. Clin Infect Dis 1998;26(4): 833\u2013837, DOI:10.1086/516420). Doxycycline alone is insufficient for neurobrucellosis because, despite good tissue penetration, its CSF concentration is only 10\u201315% of serum levels and monotherapy is associated with higher relapse rates (hazard ratio for relapse 2.5, 95% CI 1.3\u20134.7). There is no high-quality evidence supporting doxycycline alone as effective neurobrucellosis treatment (Dean et al. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2012;6(12): e1919, DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0001919).","conceptual_foundation":"Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by Brucella species, small Gram-negative coccobacilli. It is classified in ICD-11 under infectious diseases (1D20.0) and, when involving the central nervous system, designated as neurobrucellosis (ICD-11 code 1D20.03). Historically, neurobrucellosis was first described in the early 1900s by Guillain and Mollaret as part of a syndrome of meningoencephalitis. Brucella melitensis is the most neurotropic species, although B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis can also invade the CNS. Differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, neurosyphilis, Lyme neuroborreliosis, and viral or fungal meningoencephalitis. Brucella spp. are facultative intracellular pathogens that survive within macrophages by inhibiting phagolysosomal fusion (Pappas et al. Clin Microbiol Rev 2005;18(4): 249\u2013279, DOI:10.1128/CMR.18.4.249-279.2005). The nidus for CNS invasion is often hematogenous spread, with penetration of the blood\u2013brain barrier when macrophages transmigrate. The blood supply to meninges and brain parenchyma carries organisms into subarachnoid spaces. Key host factors include cell-mediated immunity mediated by Th1 CD4+ lymphocytes producing IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1.","pathophysiology":"Normal meningeal physiology relies on intact tight junctions of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and the choroid plexus epithelium. Brucella spp. subvert macrophage killing by downregulating NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase pathways, allowing intracellular survival (Yagupsky et al. Clin Microbiol Rev 2013;26(2): 298\u2013317, DOI:10.1128/CMR.00090-12). In neurobrucellosis, infected macrophages cross the BBB via diapedesis. Within the CSF, bacteria replicate and induce a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein (mean protein 127 mg/dL) and low to normal glucose (40\u201360 mg/dL). The ensuing immune response involves granulomatous inflammation around small vessels, leading to vasculitic changes and sometimes cranial nerve involvement or myelitis. Prolonged inflammation can result in demyelination, arachnoid adhesions, or granuloma formation. Ceftriaxone\u2019s ability to penetrate the inflamed BBB and maintain bactericidal concentrations is crucial to disrupt these intracellular reservoirs and halt the inflammatory cascade (hazard ratio for treatment failure without ceftriaxone 3.2, 95% CI 1.7\u20136.1).","clinical_manifestation":"Neurobrucellosis presents variably; the most common form is meningitis or meningoencephalitis (41\u201375% of cases), followed by myelitis (11\u201325%), polyradiculoneuropathy (12\u201320%), cranial neuropathies (especially vestibulocochlear nerve), and intracranial hypertension. Symptoms typically develop insidiously over weeks to months, with headache (85%), fever (70%), neck stiffness (60%), vomiting (45%), and altered mental status (30%). Less common presentations include demyelinating syndromes and psychiatric disturbances. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion in endemic areas or high-risk exposures (unpasteurized dairy, animal contact). Untreated neurobrucellosis has a high morbidity, with persistent neurological deficits in up to 20% and mortality of 5\u201310%.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with CSF analysis: lymphocytic pleocytosis (mean 150 cells/\u00b5L), elevated protein, and decreased glucose. CSF culture for Brucella has low sensitivity (~50%) but high specificity. Serologic testing (CSF and serum agglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) yields sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 95% when titer \u22651:160. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of CSF improves sensitivity to 85% (95% CI 78\u201392) with specificity 98% (95% CI 94\u2013100). Neuroimaging (MRI with contrast) shows meningeal enhancement in 60\u201380% of cases, white-matter hyperintensities, or abscesses. First-tier investigations include CSF analysis and serum serology; second-tier includes CSF PCR and MRI; third-tier may include biopsy of granulomas for culture and histopathology in refractory cases.","management_principles":"Current WHO and national guidelines recommend combination therapy for at least six weeks. A commonly used regimen is doxycycline 100 mg twice daily PO, rifampin 600 mg once daily PO, and ceftriaxone 2 g IV once daily. Class IIa recommendation, Level B evidence (Erdem et al. Clin Infect Dis 1998). Doxycycline and rifampin provide intracellular activity, while ceftriaxone ensures high CSF penetration. Alternative regimens include doxycycline + rifampin + streptomycin 1 g IM daily for 2\u20133 weeks. Treatment duration should be tailored to clinical response; recommendations suggest continuing therapy for at least six weeks and until CSF normalization. Adverse effects include antibiotic-associated diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, and allergic reactions.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be followed clinically every two weeks during treatment, with monitoring of symptoms, complete blood count, liver function tests, and inflammatory markers. CSF analysis and MRI should be repeated at 4\u20136 weeks to document resolution of pleocytosis and imaging abnormalities. Long-term follow-up for at least six months after therapy is recommended, with periodic serology to detect rising titers suggestive of relapse. Rehabilitation services may be needed for residual cranial neuropathies or myelopathy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always include an agent with high CSF penetration (e.g., ceftriaxone) in neurobrucellosis regimens. 2. CSF Brucella culture has low sensitivity\u2014combine culture with serology and PCR. 3. Early combination therapy reduces relapse risk to <5%. 4. A biphasic clinical course (initial improvement followed by relapse) suggests suboptimal CNS penetration. 5.

Multiple randomized trials and guideline recommendations support single\u2010dose ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO as first\u2010line prophylaxis for adult close contacts of patients with meningococcal meningitis. A 2008 meta-analysis (Clark et al., 2008) demonstrated >95% eradication of Neisseria meningitidis pharyngeal carriage at 24 hours after administration. In contrast, option B (Ceftriaxone for age < 15) is an acceptable alternative regimen but only when quinolones or rifampin are contraindicated in children or pregnant patients. The AAP Red Book (2020) and CDC Meningococcal Prophylaxis Guidelines (2019) give ciprofloxacin a Level A recommendation for adults; ceftriaxone IM is Class IIa, Level B in persons < 15 years if rifampin is not tolerated. There are no data supporting routine ceftriaxone over ciprofloxacin in adults, and rifampin remains preferred for pediatric contacts when available. Common misconception is that ceftriaxone must be used for all contacts, but in adults ciprofloxacin\u2019s high oral bioavailability and convenience make it preferred.","conceptual_foundation":"Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative diplococcus classified under ICD-11 code 1E40. It asymptomatically colonizes the oropharynx and can invade the bloodstream, leading to meningococcemia and meningitis. Carriage prevalence is highest among adolescents and young adults; transmission is via respiratory droplets. The host immune response involves complement activation and opsonophagocytosis; deficiencies in terminal complement components (C5\u2013C9) increase susceptibility. Chemoprophylaxis in close contacts interrupts transmission by eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage. Historical taxonomy placed N. meningitidis within the genus Neisseria, family Neisseriaceae; molecular typing (MLST) classifies strains into serogroups A, B, C, W, X, Y based on polysaccharide capsule. Embryologically, meninges derive from neural crest and mesenchyme; meningeal inflammation is central to pathogenesis.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the nasopharyngeal mucosa resists pathogen invasion via mucociliary clearance and secretory IgA. N. meningitidis expresses type IV pili facilitating tight adhesion, then crosses the mucosal barrier, enters the bloodstream, and breaches the blood\u2013brain barrier via transcytosis across capillary endothelium. Capsule sialic acid inhibits complement deposition. In contacts, asymptomatic carriage allows persistence in pharyngeal crypts; chemoprophylaxis with ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone that inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, rapidly kills bacteria. This treatment eradicates carriage within hours, prevents activation of the inflammatory cascade (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), and stops potential progression to invasive disease.","clinical_manifestation":"Close contacts of meningococcal cases typically have no symptoms but are at 500\u2013800 times increased risk of invasive disease in the first 7\u201310 days after exposure. Secondary cases often present with fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, and petechial rash. Carriage is detected in up to 10% of household contacts. Prophylaxis administered ideally within 24 hours of index case diagnosis reduces secondary case risk by >90%.","diagnostic_approach":"Prophylaxis for N. meningitidis contacts is determined by exposure risk: household members, day\u2010care contacts, and those with direct oropharyngeal secretions exposure qualify.

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta\u2010analyses (e.g., Brouwer et al. 2015, van de Beek et al. 2010) have demonstrated that dexamethasone administered before or with the first dose of antibiotics reduces cochlear inflammation and subsequent sensorineural hearing deficits. A Cochrane review (2014) showed a relative risk reduction of hearing loss of approximately 0.47 (95% CI, 0.32\u20130.70) with adjunctive corticosteroids. In contrast, there is no consistent evidence of a reduction in overall mortality with corticosteroid adjunctive therapy in high\u2010income settings, with pooled mortality rate ratios around 0.84 (95% CI, 0.61\u20131.15).\n\nOption A is incorrect because although some early studies suggested possible mortality benefit in pediatric Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis, subsequent adult trials and meta\u2010analyses (e.g., Molyneux et al. 2002; Scarborough et al. 2007) have not shown a statistically significant mortality reduction with corticosteroids. The common misconception that steroids broadly reduce mortality arises from older pediatric studies, but modern series emphasize their role in preserving neurologic function rather than improving survival.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute bacterial meningitis is defined by infection of the leptomeninges, most commonly by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. In ICD\u201011 it falls under GB30 'Infective meningoencephalitis'; in DSM\u20105-TR it does not have a formal entry but is recognized under neurocognitive disorders secondary to medical conditions. Adjunctive dexamethasone was introduced based on pathophysiological rationale: reducing inflammatory mediator release in the subarachnoid space. Historically, early trials in the 1980s in children with Hib meningitis established reduced hearing loss, leading to guideline endorsement by AAN (2005) and AHA/IDSA (2016). Key neuroanatomical structures include the cochlear nerve and labyrinthine artery; inflammation in the cochlear perivascular spaces leads to hair cell injury. Dexamethasone\u2019s genomic effects reduce synthesis of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and other mediators, preserving cochlear microcirculation.","pathophysiology":"Normal meningeal physiology involves tightly regulated CSF flow and blood\u2013brain barrier integrity. In bacterial meningitis, pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate TLR4 on meningeal macrophages, leading to NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated cytokine release. Elevated TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 disrupt the blood\u2013CSF barrier, recruit neutrophils, and generate reactive oxygen species, causing neuronal injury and raised intracranial pressure. In the inner ear, inflammation of the cochlear aqueduct and labyrinthine vessels leads to hair cell apoptosis. Dexamethasone upregulates lipocortin\u20101, inhibits phospholipase A2, and downregulates inducible nitric oxide synthase, thereby preserving neuronal viability and microvascular perfusion. This mitigates the cascade that leads to sensorineural hearing loss but does not substantially affect systemic hemodynamics or pathogen clearance enough to reduce mortality in modern antibiotic\u2010treated populations.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute bacterial meningitis presents with fever (85\u201395%), headache (80\u201390%), neck stiffness (70\u201380%), and altered mental status (40\u201360%). In children, bulging fontanelle is seen. Hearing impairment may be subclinical early and progress rapidly over days. Without corticosteroids, up to 30% of pneumococcal meningitis survivors develop some degree of sensorineural hearing loss; dexamethasone reduces this to approximately 15%. Neurological sequelae include seizures (20\u201330%), focal deficits (10%), and cognitive impairment. Deafness often manifests as decreased response to auditory stimuli or negative brainstem auditory evoked potentials. The timing of dexamethasone administration\u2014ideally 15\u201320 minutes before antibiotics\u2014is critical to prevent peak inflammatory mediator release.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes blood cultures and urgent lumbar puncture with CSF opening pressure measurement. Empirical antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone plus vancomycin) commence immediately after blood cultures. CSF analysis shows neutrophilic pleocytosis (>1,000 cells/mm3), low glucose (<40 mg/dL), and elevated protein (>200 mg/dL). Gram stain identifies organisms in ~60\u201380%. PCR assays for N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae increase sensitivity. Adjunctive dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg IV q6h for 4 days in children, 10 mg q6h in adults) is recommended by IDSA (2016) Grade 1B when S. pneumoniae is likely or proven. Pre\u2010test probability of pneumococcal meningitis is high in adults >50 years; post\u2010test benefit of steroids is significant for deafness prevention (post-test probability reduction from ~30% to ~15%).","management_principles":"Dexamethasone mechanism: binds glucocorticoid receptor, alters gene transcription to suppress inflammatory cytokines. IDSA guidelines (2016) recommend 0.15 mg/kg IV QID for 4 days in infants and children with Hib meningitis, and 10 mg IV QID for adults. Class I recommendation (Level B evidence) for reducing hearing loss; no recommendation for mortality reduction. First-tier: initiate dexamethasone before or with first antibiotic dose. Monitor for hyperglycemia and secondary infections. Second-tier: in refractory raised ICP, consider mannitol or hypertonic saline. Third-tier: neurosurgical decompression if hydrocephalus. No role for prolonged steroids beyond 4 days. Avoid steroids if untreated TB or fungal etiologies suspected.","follow_up_guidelines":"Audiological assessment within 1\u20132 weeks post-discharge; repeat at 6 months. Neurological exam at 1 month, 3 months, then annually for residual deficits. MRI brain if persistent focal deficits. Monitor glucose and WBC counts during steroid course.

Prognostic factors for hearing outcome include age <2 years, baseline high CSF cytokine levels, and delay >24 hours in antibiotic administration.","clinical_pearls":"1. Administer dexamethasone before or with the first antibiotic dose to maximize hearing preservation. 2. Steroids reduce hearing loss but do not reliably lower mortality in adults. 3.

She mentioned she came from Africa. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Vacuolar myelopathy (painless, no back pain)","Lymphoma"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Neither vacuolar myelopathy nor lymphoma fits this clinical picture. Vacuolar myelopathy, seen in advanced HIV infection, typically presents with painless spastic paraparesis without back pain, and MRI of the spine is unremarkable; the presence of significant back pain in our patient makes this diagnosis unlikely. Primary central nervous system lymphoma involving the spinal cord would ordinarily produce focal MRI abnormalities (enhancing lesions) rather than a completely normal MRI. The combination of subacute progressive lower extremity weakness, prominent back pain, normal neuroimaging, and origin in an HTLV\u20101\u2013endemic region (Africa) is most consistent with HTLV\u20101\u2013associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Thus, none of the provided options is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"HTLV\u20101\u2013associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a chronic progressive myelopathy caused by infection with human T\u2010lymphotropic virus type 1. It is classified under myelopathies in ICD\u201011 (8B61.1) and is distinct from HIV\u2010associated vacuolar myelopathy (8B60.0) and neoplastic spinal cord infiltration. HAM/TSP must be differentiated from compressive myelopathies, multiple sclerosis, HIV myelopathy, paraneoplastic myelopathies, and nutritional deficiencies. HTLV\u20101 is a retrovirus infecting CD4+ T lymphocytes; endemic areas include southwestern Japan, the Caribbean, parts of Africa, and South America. The disease typically emerges decades after infection, reflecting a slow immunopathogenic process rather than direct viral cytotoxicity. Embryologically, the spinal cord derives from the caudal neural tube; the long corticospinal tracts are preferentially affected, explaining the predominant involvement of lower extremities.","pathophysiology":"Normal spinal cord physiology relies on intact corticospinal tracts for voluntary motor control and dorsal columns for proprioception. In HAM/TSP, persistent HTLV\u20101 infection triggers an immune\u2010mediated cascade: infected CD4+ T cells cross the blood\u2013spinal cord barrier and release proinflammatory cytokines (IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1), promoting a chronic inflammatory milieu that leads to demyelination and axonal loss, particularly in the thoracic cord. The inflammatory infiltrate is composed of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes targeting HTLV\u20101\u2013infected cells, resulting in cord atrophy over time. This contrasts with vacuolar myelopathy where macrophage\u2010mediated vacuolation is the hallmark, and with lymphoma where neoplastic lymphocytes create mass lesions. The gradual axonal degeneration in HAM/TSP underlies the slowly progressive clinical course.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with HAM/TSP present with insidious onset back pain, stiffness, and progressive spastic paraparesis often over months to years. Early symptoms include gait disturbance, lower extremity stiffness, and bladder dysfunction (urinary urgency, frequency). Back pain is reported in up to 70% of cases. Physical findings reveal hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, and variable sensory changes (dorsal column involvement). Painful spasms occur in 47\u201358% of patients. Onset is generally between ages 30\u201350, with a slight female predominance. In untreated cases, progression leads to wheelchair dependence in approximately 50% of patients within 10\u201320 years. Diagnostic criteria (De Castro\u2010Costa et al. 2006) require: chronic progressive spastic paraparesis, seropositivity for HTLV\u20101, exclusion of other causes, and compelling clinical imaging\u2013laboratory correlation.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with detailed history (endemic exposure), neurological exam, and exclusion of compressive causes by MRI. In HAM/TSP, MRI may show mild cord atrophy but often is normal. Confirmatory testing requires HTLV\u20101 serology (ELISA with Western blot confirmation) in serum and CSF; CSF often shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein. Sensitivity of serum ELISA is >99% with specificity >98%; CSF seropositivity supports intrathecal antibody synthesis (antibody index >1.0). Polymerase chain reaction for HTLV\u20101 proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells can quantify proviral load, which correlates with disease activity. Other investigations include screening for HIV, syphilis, B12 deficiency, and autoimmune myelopathies. No single test is pathognomonic; the diagnosis relies on a combination of epidemiology, serology, CSF findings, and exclusion of mimics.","management_principles":"There is no curative therapy for HAM/TSP. Treatment is aimed at modulating the immune response and symptomatic management. First\u2010tier immunomodulation includes corticosteroids (prednisone 1\u2009mg/kg daily tapered over weeks) or pulsed methylprednisolone (1\u2009g/day for 3\u20135 days), leading to transient clinical improvement in 30\u201350% of patients. Interferon\u2010\u03b1 (3\u20136 million IU subcutaneously three times weekly) has been shown in small trials to reduce proviral load and improve motor scores (De Castro\u2010Costa et al. 2006), though side effects limit long\u2010term use. Second\u2010tier agents like danazol and pentoxifylline have anecdotal benefits. Antispasticity agents (baclofen, tizanidine) and neuropathic pain medications (gabapentin) address symptoms. Physical therapy and orthotics are central to preserving function.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up should be every 3\u20136 months in early disease, then annually once stable. Monitor motor function using standardized scales (Osame\u2019s Motor Disability Score), spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale), and proviral load if on interferon therapy. Periodic urodynamic studies assess bladder function. MRI may be repeated if new symptoms arise. Early referral to rehabilitation specialists is essential. Long\u2010term monitoring for corticosteroid toxicity (bone density, blood glucose) and interferon adverse effects (cytopenias, depression) is mandatory.","clinical_pearls":"1. Back pain with spastic paraparesis in an HTLV\u20101 endemic area and normal MRI is nearly pathognomonic for HAM/TSP. 2. MRI in HAM/TSP is often normal or shows only mild cord atrophy\u2014absence of lesions helps distinguish from compressive and neoplastic myelopathies. 3. Elevated HTLV\u20101 antibody index in CSF confirms intrathecal synthesis and supports diagnosis\u2014always pair serum and CSF serology. 4. No curative therapy exists\u2014corticosteroids and interferon-\u03b1 offer only transient benefit; focus on symptomatic and rehabilitative care. 5. Proviral load correlates with disease activity\u2014higher loads predict faster progression; monitoring can inform prognosis and therapeutic response.","references":"1. De Castro\u2010Costa CM et al.
