[{"question_number":"7","question":"A patient with back pain radiating to the left lower limb and normal ankle reflex. What muscle is involved?","options":["Superior gluteus","Iliopsoas"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Iliopsoas","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Iliopsoas. In the context of radicular back pain radiating into the lower limb with a normal ankle reflex, S1 root function (ankle jerk) is intact, while involvement of the L1\u2013L3 roots manifests as hip flexion weakness. The iliopsoas muscle is innervated predominantly by the L1\u2013L3 nerve roots via the femoral nerve. Option A (Superior gluteus) is incorrect: the superior gluteal muscle group (gluteus medius/minimus) is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve (L4\u2013S1) and would not present with a normal S1 reflex if that root were compromised. A normal ankle reflex therefore excludes S1 involvement and argues against superior gluteal innervation pathology.","conceptual_foundation":"Radiculopathy refers to dysfunction of a nerve root, classically manifesting as dermatomal pain, myotomal weakness, and reflex changes. The myotomal map shows that hip flexion is mediated by L1\u2013L3 roots via the iliopsoas muscle. Anatomically, the psoas major and iliacus converge to form the iliopsoas, which flexes the hip. In contrast, the superior gluteal nerve arises from L4\u2013S1, innervating gluteus medius/minimus to produce hip abduction. Recognizing the normal ankle (S1) reflex excludes S1 root involvement and narrows the lesion to L1\u2013L3 distribution.","pathophysiology":"Compression or inflammation of the L1\u2013L3 nerve roots at the lumbar spine (e.g., due to disc herniation at L2\u2013L3 or L3\u2013L4) leads to impaired conduction along the femoral nerve fibers supplying the iliopsoas. Loss of hip flexion strength occurs without affecting the S1 reflex arc. In contrast, superior gluteal nerve injury (L4\u2013S1) would impair hip abduction and could alter pelvic stability but would often affect the S1 segment and reflex.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with L1\u2013L3 radiculopathy present with groin or anterior thigh pain and hip flexion weakness, demonstrating difficulty climbing stairs or rising from a seated position. Reflexes at the knee (L4) may be reduced if L4 is involved, while the ankle jerk (S1) remains normal. Superior gluteal nerve lesions present with Trendelenburg gait and inability to maintain pelvic stability during single-leg stance.","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical evaluation begins with detailed myotomal testing: hip flexion (iliopsoas, L1\u2013L3), hip abduction (gluteus medius, L4\u2013S1), knee extension (quadriceps, L3\u2013L4), and ankle jerk (S1). MRI of the lumbar spine is the gold standard to identify nerve root compression, with sensitivity >90% and specificity ~88% for disc herniation in radiculopathy. Electromyography can confirm denervation in the iliopsoas.","management_principles":"Initial management includes analgesics (NSAIDs), activity modification, and targeted physical therapy focusing on hip flexor strengthening. Epidural steroid injections at the affected level can provide symptomatic relief (Level B evidence). Surgical decompression (microdiscectomy) is reserved for refractory or progressive motor deficits.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess hip flexion strength and pain scores at 4\u20136 weeks. Repeat MRI if no improvement or if new neurologic deficits develop. Long-term: physical therapy to maintain core and hip flexor strength and prevent recurrence.","clinical_pearls":"\u2022 A normal ankle jerk localizes pathology above S1. \u2022 Iliopsoas weakness indicates L1\u2013L3 involvement. \u2022 Superior gluteal nerve lesions spare hip flexion. \u2022 Myotomal testing guides imaging. \u2022 Early physical therapy improves outcomes.","references":"1.

What is the most likely genetic abnormality?","options":["GCG Repeat","D4Z4"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"GCG Repeat","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. GCG Repeat. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by a GCG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the PABPN1 gene, leading to ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness typically presenting in the fifth or sixth decade. Option B, D4Z4, is a contraction on chromosome 4 causing facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), which presents with scapular winging and facial weakness, not predominant ocular involvement or dysphagia. Key evidence: Brais et al. (1998) identified the GCG repeat expansion in PABPN1 in OPMD patients (Nature Genetics. 1998;18(2):164\u2013167).","conceptual_foundation":"OPMD is an autosomal dominant myopathy characterized by adult-onset ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness, classified under muscular dystrophies in ICD-11. The PABPN1 gene encodes a poly(A)-binding nuclear protein essential for mRNA processing. Normal alleles have 10 GCG repeats, while disease alleles have 12\u201317 repeats. Differential includes myasthenia gravis (fluctuating weakness), bulbar ALS, and mitochondrial myopathies. Genetic anticipation is mild in OPMD due to modest repeat sizes.","pathophysiology":"Expanded alanine tracts from GCG repeats cause PABPN1 nuclear aggregation, disrupts mRNA polyadenylation, and triggers proteotoxic stress, leading to myonuclear inclusions and myofiber degeneration. This contrasts with D4Z4 contraction in FSHD leading to DUX4 misexpression and muscle toxicity. In OPMD, muscle biopsy shows rimmed vacuoles and nuclear inclusions positive for PABPN1.","clinical_manifestation":"Mean age at onset ~50 years. Symptoms begin with bilateral ptosis in >90% of cases, dysphagia in 70%, then proximal limb weakness in 60%. Course is slowly progressive over decades. OPMD spares ocular motility and facial muscles until late; extraocular muscles may be affected minimally. Dysphagia may cause aspiration pneumonia.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing for PABPN1 GCG expansion (sensitivity ~100%). EMG shows myopathic changes; CK is mildly elevated (~2\u20133\u00d7 ULN). MRI shows selective muscle involvement in pharyngeal and proximal limb muscles. Pretest probability is high in typical clinical presentation. Family history of ptosis and dysphagia supports testing.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy. Supportive care includes blepharoplasty for ptosis, cricopharyngeal myotomy or dilatation for dysphagia, and physical therapy. Nutritional support and speech therapy reduce aspiration risk. Pyridostigmine has no proven benefit. Experimental approaches targeting protein aggregation are under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual neuromuscular assessment, swallow studies every 1\u20132 years. Eye surgery evaluation as needed. Monitor nutritional status and pulmonary function. Genetic counseling for family planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. Adult\u2010onset ptosis plus dysphagia suggests OPMD. 2. CK elevation is mild or normal. 3. PABPN1 GCG repeat testing is diagnostic. 4. Cricopharyngeal myotomy improves swallowing. 5.

C5\u2013C6 radiculopathy often affects the suprascapular nerve, which innervates the infraspinatus and supraspinatus muscles. Infraspinatus dysfunction leads to weakness in external rotation of the shoulder. No other options were provided.","conceptual_foundation":"The brachial plexus roots C5\u2013C6 form the upper trunk, from which the suprascapular nerve branches off to supply the infraspinatus and supraspinatus. These muscles stabilize the glenohumeral joint and control abduction and external rotation.","pathophysiology":"Disc herniation at C4\u2013C5 or C5\u2013C6 compresses the C5 and C6 roots, leading to denervation of the suprascapular nerve. This results in muscle fiber atrophy and impaired external rotation due to infraspinatus weakness.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report shoulder pain, weakness in external rotation, and may have atrophy in the infraspinous fossa.

Duchenne (B) and Becker (D) muscular dystrophies predominantly affect pelvic girdle and proximal leg muscles with calf pseudohypertrophy and present in boys. Myotonic dystrophy (C) features myotonia, early cataracts, and multisystem involvement rather than isolated facial-scapular weakness.","conceptual_foundation":"FSHD is the third most common muscular dystrophy, autosomal dominant, linked to contraction of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats on chromosome 4q35 leading to toxic DUX4 expression. Onset typically occurs in adolescence or early adulthood with facial weakness (inability to whistle, close eyes tightly) followed by scapular stabilizer involvement causing winging and difficulty elevating arms.","pathophysiology":"Deletion of D4Z4 repeats relaxes chromatin structure, enabling aberrant expression of the DUX4 transcription factor in muscle cells. DUX4 induces apoptosis and disrupts muscle regeneration pathways. The degree of repeat contraction correlates inversely with disease severity.","clinical_manifestation":"History often reveals difficulty with eye closure, whistling, and lifting overhead. Asymmetric scapular winging leads to 'batwing' appearance. Lower limb involvement occurs later. Serum CK is moderately elevated (up to 10\u00d7 normal).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing demonstrating D4Z4 repeat contraction with a residual repeat array of 1\u201310 units. EMG shows myopathic motor units and occasional spontaneous fibrillations. Muscle MRI can detect selective muscle involvement patterns.","management_principles":"No curative therapy exists. Management includes physical therapy to maintain range of motion, scapular fixation surgery in severe winging, and monitoring for respiratory compromise. Experimental therapies targeting DUX4 expression (antisense oligonucleotides) are under investigation (Phase II trials).","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual respiratory function testing (FVC) and cardiac screening are recommended. Orthotic support and symptomatic treatment of pain are part of multidisciplinary care.","clinical_pearls":"1. Asymmetric facial weakness with scapular winging is pathognomonic for FSHD. 2. DUX4 gene derepression underlies pathogenesis. 3. Calf hypertrophy suggests Duchenne/Becker, not FSHD. 4. Genetic testing for D4Z4 contraction confirms diagnosis. 5.
