[{"question_number":"5","question":"In Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, which gene mutation is related to earlier onset?","options":["APP","APO.B"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"APP","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. APP. Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21 are well\u2010established causes of autosomal dominant early\u2010onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (EOAD), often presenting before age 65 and sometimes as early as the third to fourth decade. These mutations increase production or aggregation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides, leading to earlier and more aggressive amyloid pathology. By contrast, APOB (option B) encodes apolipoprotein B, which is involved in lipid transport and not linked to EOAD pathogenesis. No credible evidence associates APOB mutations with Alzheimer\u2019s onset age.","conceptual_foundation":"Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular A\u03b2 plaques and intraneuronal tau tangles. Familial EOAD represents <1% of all AD cases and follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The three primary genes implicated are APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, each encoding proteins critical to the generation of A\u03b2. APP is cleaved by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases into A\u03b240 and the aggregation-prone A\u03b242. Mutations in APP shift cleavage toward the A\u03b242 species or accelerate oligomerization. EOAD due to APP mutations was first identified by Goate et al. (1991), establishing a direct genetic link between APP processing and AD pathology.","pathophysiology":"Normal APP processing follows two pathways: the non\u2010amyloidogenic \u03b1-secretase route and the amyloidogenic \u03b2-secretase route. Mutant APP enhances \u03b2-secretase cleavage or alters \u03b3-secretase sites, raising the A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio. A\u03b242 oligomerizes into toxic soluble assemblies that disrupt synaptic function, trigger microglial activation, and promote tau hyperphosphorylation. Progressive neuronal loss ensues, particularly in hippocampal and cortical networks. Early onset correlates with higher oligomer burden and faster plaque seeding kinetics compared to sporadic AD.","clinical_manifestation":"Familial APP mutation carriers typically present between ages 30\u201360 with progressive episodic memory loss, executive dysfunction, visuospatial deficits, and behavioral changes. Rates of progression are faster than sporadic late\u2010onset AD, with median survival of 6\u20139 years post\u2010symptom onset. Neurological exam may reveal parkinsonian signs or myoclonus in some APP mutants. Variability exists depending on the specific mutation\u2019s effect on A\u03b2 kinetics.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation mirrors sporadic AD: neuropsychological testing, MRI to exclude alternative etiologies, and CSF biomarkers (low A\u03b242, elevated total tau and phospho-tau). Definitive diagnosis in familial cases requires targeted genetic testing for APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations. Genetic counseling is essential. Sensitivity and specificity of genetic testing for known pathogenic APP variants approach 100% for familial pedigrees.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying treatments are approved specifically for APP\u2010mutation EOAD. Management focuses on symptomatic therapies: cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine) and NMDA receptor antagonists (memantine). Clinical trials of anti\u2010A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., aducanumab, lecanemab) have shown plaque clearance but limited cognitive benefit and carry ARIA risks. Supportive care includes cognitive rehabilitation and behavioral management.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months with serial cognitive scales (MMSE, MoCA) and functional assessments. Monitor for treatment side effects, caregiver stress, and emergent neuropsychiatric symptoms. Consider repeat imaging or CSF biomarker monitoring in clinical trial settings. Advance\u2010care planning should be addressed early.","clinical_pearls":"1. APP mutations cause autosomal dominant EOAD with earlier and more aggressive amyloid pathology. 2. The Swedish APP mutation (KM670/671NL) increases total A\u03b2 production and onset in the 50s. 3. PSEN1 mutations are the most common cause of familial EOAD and often present earlier than APP mutants. 4. APOE \u03b54 influences risk and age of onset in sporadic AD but is not causative in familial EOAD. 5. Genetic counseling is mandatory before and after testing for familial AD genes.","references":"1. Goate A, et al.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is pathologically defined by the presence of Lewy bodies composed of aggregated alpha-synuclein within cortical and subcortical neurons. Consensus diagnostic criteria (McKeith et al., Neurology 2017) designate cortical alpha-synuclein deposition as the hallmark neuropathologic feature, with diffuse neocortical Lewy bodies correlating with clinical dementia. Autopsy series report >80% sensitivity and >90% specificity for distinguishing pure DLB from Alzheimer disease (AD) using cortical alpha-synuclein immunostaining (Hamilton RL, Brain Pathol 2000). Option A, Tauopathy, characterizes disorders with predominant tau protein aggregation (e.g., AD, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration) but is not the primary molecular pathology in DLB. While mixed pathology can occur, pure DLB shows minimal tau burden compared to alpha-synuclein. Common misconceptions include conflating Lewy body pathology with tauopathies due to overlapping cognitive decline, but immunohistochemistry differentiates synuclein versus tau aggregates with high diagnostic accuracy.","conceptual_foundation":"Dementia with Lewy bodies (ICD-11: 6E72.0) falls under major neurocognitive disorders characterized by alpha-synuclein proteinopathy. Initially described by Kosaka in 1976, DLB was formally defined by the DLB Consortium in 1996, with updates in 2005 and 2017 refining clinical and pathological correlations. Differential diagnoses include AD (tau and amyloid-beta pathology), Parkinson disease dementia (PDD; synucleinopathy with parkinsonism preceding dementia by >1 year), frontotemporal dementia (tau or TDP-43), and vascular dementia. Embryologically, SNCA gene\u2013encoded alpha-synuclein is expressed in presynaptic terminals from early neuronal development. Neuroanatomically, Lewy bodies localize in substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, amygdala, and neocortex, with Braak staging describing progression from brainstem to neocortex. Molecularly, SNCA mutations or multiplications cause familial synucleinopathies. Alpha-synuclein misfolding disrupts synaptic vesicle trafficking, axonal transport, and mitochondrial function, leading to cholinergic and dopaminergic neuronal loss and widespread network dysfunction.","pathophysiology":"Normal alpha-synuclein regulates synaptic vesicle docking and neurotransmitter release. Pathologic misfolding fosters oligomerization, \u03b2-sheet fibril formation, and insoluble Lewy body inclusion within neurons. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, and lysosomal/autophagic dysfunction synergize to accelerate aggregation. Microglial activation and neuroinflammation further exacerbate neuronal injury. Loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons underlies parkinsonism, while degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert contributes to cognitive decline and visual hallucinations. Disease progression follows a stereotyped caudo-rostral pattern (Braak \u03b1-synuclein staging), with early involvement of the olfactory bulb and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Comparative pathophysiology: tauopathies involve hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of microtubule-associated protein tau, producing neurofibrillary tangles and differing in regional vulnerability and clinical phenotype from synucleinopathies.","clinical_manifestation":"DLB typically presents in individuals aged 65\u201380 years with core clinical features: fluctuating cognition (85%), recurrent complex visual hallucinations (75%), spontaneous parkinsonism (65%), and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (80%). Supportive features include severe neuroleptic sensitivity, autonomic dysfunction, and syncope. Subtypes include DLB with concomitant AD pathology (mixed dementia) and prodromal DLB where RBD or mild cognitive impairment precede full-blown dementia. The natural history involves progressive cognitive and motor decline over 5\u20138 years, with shorter survival compared to AD (median 6.7 vs. 8.3 years; HR 1.4). Formal diagnostic criteria (McKeith et al. 2017) require two core features or one core plus one suggestive feature (e.g., abnormal DAT imaging or polysomnographic confirmation of RBD). Sensitivity of probable DLB criteria is ~80% and specificity ~95%. Atypical presentations in immunocompromised patients or those with cerebrovascular comorbidities may obscure classic features.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes comprehensive clinical history emphasizing cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and RBD, and neurological examination for parkinsonian signs. Brain MRI is performed to exclude alternative etiologies; it often shows mild global or occipital lobe atrophy. Second-tier: DAT SPECT or FP-CIT PET demonstrating reduced striatal dopamine transporter uptake confirms presynaptic dopaminergic deficit (sensitivity 78\u201388%, specificity 90\u201394%; AAN Level A). Third-tier: MIBG myocardial scintigraphy showing cardiac sympathetic denervation (sensitivity 80\u201385%, specificity 85\u201390%). EEG may reveal posterior dominant slowing with transient sharp waves. CSF biomarkers show normal A\u03b242/tau ratio versus AD. Polysomnography confirms RBD (sensitivity 83%, specificity 88%). Emerging seed amplification assays for alpha-synuclein in CSF show sensitivity 95% and specificity 100% for synucleinopathies. Clinical diagnostic algorithms incorporate pre- and post-test probabilities to refine diagnosis.","management_principles":"Symptomatic management targets cognitive, psychiatric, motor, and sleep symptoms. Rivastigmine (3\u201312 mg/day transdermal or oral) is first-line for cognitive impairment (class I, Level A; effect size 0.4, p<0.01) and may improve hallucinations by enhancing cholinergic tone (NNT=5). Memantine has modest benefit (class II). Parkinsonism is treated with low-dose levodopa (100\u2013300 mg/day), balancing motor benefit against risk of exacerbating psychosis. Psychosis and agitation may respond to quetiapine (25\u201350 mg/day) or clozapine (12.5\u201350 mg/night) (class II); typical antipsychotics are contraindicated due to neuroleptic sensitivity. RBD is managed with melatonin (3\u201312 mg at bedtime) or clonazepam (0.25\u20131 mg). Non-pharmacologic interventions include cognitive stimulation therapy, physical and occupational therapy for gait and fall prevention, and sleep hygiene. Investigational therapies targeting alpha-synuclein immunotherapy are in clinical trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits are recommended every 3\u20136 months, assessing cognition (MMSE, MoCA), motor function (UPDRS-III), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI), sleep habits, and autonomic function (orthostatic vitals, COMPASS-31). Laboratory surveillance includes annual CBC, metabolic panel, thyroid function, B12, and folate. Repeat MRI is reserved for atypical progression. Periodic evaluation by multidisciplinary team\u2014neurology, geriatrics, psychiatry, physical therapy\u2014is advised. Advance care planning and caregiver support resources should be addressed early. Prognosis: median survival ~7 years from diagnosis, with faster decline in mixed pathology. Palliative care involvement is recommended in advanced stages for symptom management and quality-of-life support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Fluctuating cognition with pronounced hour-to-hour variation is a high-yield distinguishing feature from Alzheimer disease. 2. Well-formed visual hallucinations early in the disease course strongly suggest DLB (sensitivity 75%, specificity 90%). 3. REM sleep behavior disorder often antedates cognitive decline by several years and is a prodromal marker. 4. Severe neuroleptic sensitivity\u2014marked worsening of parkinsonism and confusion\u2014occurs with typical antipsychotics; prefer quetiapine or clozapine. 5. DaT SPECT imaging is supportive when clinical criteria are inconclusive; the mnemonic \u201cVAPOR\u201d (Visual hallucinations, Akinetic-rigidity, Parkinsonism, Organize fluctuations, REM behavior disorder) aids recall.","references":"1.

Mislocalization and phosphorylation of TDP-43 in cortical and spinal motor neurons underlie cytoplasmic inclusions and neuronal death, making option A definitively correct. Common misconceptions arise from earlier ubiquitin-only staining studies that failed to specify the protein identity, leading some to erroneously select ubiquitin alone.\n\nOption B: Tau protein (60 words)\nTau pathology predominates in primary tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal degeneration (CBD), with 4-repeat and 3-repeat tau isoforms. In FTD syndromes (FTD-tau), tau inclusions are present in ~40% of cases but rarely overlap with ALS motor neuron disease. A patient presenting with vertical gaze palsy and early postural instability might suggest PSP rather than ALS-FTD, making tau an incorrect choice here.\n\nOption C: Ubiquitin (60 words)\nUbiquitin immunoreactivity was historically noted in both ALS and FTD inclusions, but ubiquitin alone is a non-specific marker of proteostasis disturbance. Many neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s) show ubiquitinated inclusions, leading to low specificity (~30% specificity in differential diagnosis). A clinical vignette with parkinsonism and Lewy bodies might highlight ubiquitin, but in ALS-FTD, co-staining for TDP-43 is required for definitive identification, excluding ubiquitin alone.\n\nOption D: SOD1 (55 words)\nMutations in SOD1 cause ~2% of familial ALS (autosomal dominant) with toxic gain-of-function aggregates, but SOD1 inclusions are nearly absent in sporadic ALS and FTD. A younger patient with family history of ALS and SOD1 A4V mutation may show SOD1-positive inclusions, yet such cases rarely present with FTD features. Thus, SOD1 is not the principal pathology underlying the ALS-FTD continuum, rendering option D incorrect.\n\nDefinitive Pathophysiology (35 words)\nPhosphorylated, ubiquitinated TDP-43 mislocalizes from nucleus to cytoplasm, forming insoluble inclusions that disrupt RNA processing and splicing. Multiple neuropathological studies (Mackenzie et al. 2011) confirm TDP-43 as the unifying proteinopathy in ALS-FTD.","conceptual_foundation":"The ALS-FTD continuum implicates both motor and cognitive/anterior temporal lobe circuits. Anatomical structures include the primary motor cortex (Betz cells in layer V), corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts descending through internal capsule, brainstem motor nuclei (cranial nerve V, VII, X, XII), and anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices mediating behavior. Embryologically, upper and lower motor neurons derive from neuroepithelial cells in the ventricular zone, while frontotemporal networks develop from lateral pallium. Normal physiology entails glutamatergic excitatory projections from Betz cells modulated by inhibitory GABAergic interneurons; in frontotemporal regions, the default mode network regulates social cognition and executive function. Disorders such as primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) affect Betz cells selectively, whereas semantic dementia targets anterior temporal lobes. First described by Jean-Martin Charcot in 1869, ALS was long considered pure motor neuron disease until Neary et al. (1998) noted FTD overlap. Key landmarks include the precentral gyrus for motor output and the uncinate fasciculus connecting orbitofrontal cortex to temporal pole\u2014both degenerate in ALS-FTD. Recognition of these structures underlies clinical syndromic classification and guides neuropathological sampling (MND-FTD consensus 2011).","pathophysiology":"ALS-FTD pathology originates at the molecular level with TDP-43 misfolding. Normally, TDP-43 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm to regulate RNA splicing via glycine-rich C-terminal domains. Pathological triggers\u2014such as C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions (~40% of familial ALS-FTD, autosomal dominant) or GRN loss-of-function mutations (~10% of FTD)\u2014initiate stress granule formation and TDP-43 phosphorylation at Ser409/410 by kinases such as casein kinase 1 \u03b5/\u03b4. Aggregates sequester RNA-binding proteins, disrupt axonal transport (kinesin/dynein complex), and impair mitochondrial dynamics, leading to energy failure (reduced ATP by 30% in spinal neurons). Inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, microglial CD68 upregulation) exacerbate neurotoxicity. The time course spans pre-symptomatic synaptic pruning (months) to overt neuronal loss with denervation within 6\u201312 months. Compensatory sprouting of remaining axons (20% increase in motor unit size) temporarily preserves function but fails as pathology propagates through corticofugal pathways in a prion-like manner along connected networks. Ultimately, both motor and frontotemporal circuits succumb to progressive TDP-43 deposition and neuroinflammation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present between ages 50\u201365 years, with median survival 2\u20135 years post-onset. Initial symptoms often include focal limb weakness (70%), slurred speech or dysphagia (30%), or behavioral changes such as apathy and disinhibition (45% when FTD features emerge). Symptom timeline: months 0\u20133: subtle fasciculations and executive dysfunction; 3\u20136 months: progressive muscle atrophy and social withdrawal; 6\u201312 months: functional decline with respiratory compromise. Neurological exam reveals upper motor neuron signs\u2014spasticity, hyperreflexia (75%), Babinski sign\u2014and lower motor neuron findings\u2014fasciculations (65%), muscle wasting, hyporeflexia in affected segments. Pediatric cases (juvenile ALS) are rare (<5%), often linked to FUS mutations, whereas elders (>75) may manifest slower progression. Gender differences: males have ~1.5:1 incidence ratio and earlier bulbar involvement. Systemic features include weight loss (>10% body weight by 6 months), sialorrhea, sleep-disordered breathing. Severity scales: ALSFRS-R declines ~1 point/month; FTLD-modified CDR expands from 0.5 to 2 within 1 year for frontotemporal involvement. Red flags include rapid cognitive decline, hallucinations (suggesting C9orf72), and atypical sensory symptoms warrant alternative diagnoses. Without treatment, patients reach full paralysis and ventilatory failure within 3 years in ~60% of cases.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Clinical assessment: detailed history, neurological exam focusing on UMN and LMN signs. 2.

In more than 95% of sporadic ALS and 50% of FTD cases, pathological cytoplasmic inclusions contain ubiquitinated TDP-43 protein. In a 2011 neuropathology series (Smith et al.) 97% of ALS patients demonstrated neuronal TDP-43 mislocalization. Clinical scenarios include patients presenting with both upper and lower motor neuron signs plus behavioral variant FTD. Misconceptions arise because some students overemphasize Tau in neurodegeneration, but Tauopathies are rare in pure ALS/FTD. Molecular studies (Mann et al. 2013) confirm TDP-43\u2019s RNA-binding dysfunction drives neurotoxicity.\n\nOption B (Tau): Incorrect for the ALS/FTD complex. Tau aggregation is characteristic of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), not classical ALS/FTD. In PSP, 4-repeat Tau accumulates in basal ganglia and brainstem nuclei, producing vertical gaze palsy. Some FTD subtypes (FTD-Pick\u2019s disease) have Tau-positive Pick bodies in frontal cortex. In pure ALS or C9ORF72-related FTD, Tau is not a primary aggregating protein (<2% cases). Choosing Tau reflects a misconception conflating Alzheimer pathology with motor neuron disease.\n\nOption C (SOD1): Mutant SOD1 protein aggregates in roughly 2% of familial ALS cases with autosomal dominant inheritance. Familial carriers of SOD1 mutations (e.g., A4V) usually present in the fifth decade with rapid progression over 12\u201318 months. Sporadic ALS patients rarely show SOD1 inclusions. SOD1-based pathology is cytosolic but lacks the ubiquitinated TDP-43 signature. Therefore, SOD1 is incorrect for the broad ALS/FTD spectrum.\n\nOption D (FUS): FUS protein inclusions occur in about 5% of juvenile-onset and early-onset familial ALS. These inclusions are seen predominantly in anterior horn cells. Clinically, FUS mutation carriers have a median survival of 24 months versus 36 months in TDP-43 cases. While FUS pathology overlaps with motor neuron disease, it is rare in FTD unless there is accompanying FUS gene mutation. Thus, FUS is not the primary protein in typical ALS/FTD presentations.","conceptual_foundation":"The ALS/FTD proteinopathy primarily involves TDP-43, a 43-kDa transactive response DNA-binding protein encoded by the TARDBP gene on chromosome 1p36. Anatomically, affected regions include upper motor neurons in the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus), specifically giant Betz cells in layer V, lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord (C3\u2013T1, L1\u2013L2 segments), and motor brainstem nuclei such as the hypoglossal nucleus (CN XII). In frontotemporal dementia, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior temporal lobes show neuronal loss, gliosis, and TDP-43-positive inclusions.\n\nEmbryologically, these neurons originate from the neural tube\u2019s alar and basal plates; upper motor neurons derive from dorsal precursors that migrate ventrally, while lower motor neurons originate from ventrolateral basal plate progenitors. TDP-43 normally shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, regulating RNA splicing, stability, microRNA biogenesis, and stress granule dynamics. Dysregulation leads to cryptic exon inclusion and impaired RNA transport.\n\nRelated neurological conditions include pure ALS (without dementia), FTLD-TDP, and rare multisystem proteinopathy syndromes. Historically, ALS was described by Charcot in 1869; FTD was first detailed by Arnold Pick in 1892. In the mid-2000s, discovery of TDP-43 in ubiquitin-positive inclusions revolutionized understanding, shifting focus from SOD1-centric models. Key landmarks include the precentral gyrus, insular cortex (behavioral regulation), and anterior cingulate (emotional processing), each guiding clinical localization.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, TDP-43 contains two RNA recognition motifs and a glycine-rich C-terminal domain prone to aggregation. Under stress or due to pathogenic TARDBP mutations, TDP-43 is hyperphosphorylated at serine residues 409 and 410 by casein kinase 1 and mislocalizes from nucleus to cytoplasm. This nuclear clearance leads to loss of normal splicing regulation of transcripts such as STMN2, impacting axonal repair. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions co-aggregate with polyubiquitin and p62, impairing proteasome and autophagy pathways.\n\nGenetically, TARDBP mutations account for 4% of familial ALS; C9ORF72 hexanucleotide expansions (GGGGCC repeat >30 copies) account for 40% familial ALS/FTD. Mutant C9ORF72 produces dipeptide repeat proteins that sequester TDP-43. SOD1 and FUS mutations follow autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Neuroinflammation is mediated by activated microglia releasing IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and by astrocytic dysfunction leading to glutamate excitotoxicity through reduced EAAT2/GLT-1 expression. Neuronal energy deficits arise from mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing ATP to below 50% in spinal motor neurons.\n\nPathological changes begin with subtle TDP-43 mislocalization over months; inclusions become detectable with ubiquitin immunohistochemistry at 6\u201312 months before clinical weakness. Compensatory sprouting of surviving motor units temporarily preserves strength, but declines after 18\u201324 months, correlating with EMG evidence of widespread denervation-reinnervation cycles.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often first note focal muscle weakness or fasciculations, typically starting in a single limb (arm or leg) around age 55 (range 40\u201370). The timeline from symptom onset to peak disability averages 18\u201336 months. Upper motor neuron signs include spasticity, hyperreflexia (Ashworth score >2 in 80% of cases), and Babinski sign. Lower motor neuron features manifest as muscle atrophy (Medical Research Council scale grade \u22644/5 in affected myotomes), fasciculations (seen in 85% by EMG), and cramps.\n\nIn patients with concurrent FTD, early personality changes such as apathy, disinhibition, and executive dysfunction appear within 6 months of motor onset in 30% of cases. Pediatric-onset ALS is rare (<5%), with more aggressive progression and prominent FUS pathology. Adult-onset ALS predominates in males (male-to-female 1.5:1). Bulbar-onset disease (25% of cases) presents with dysarthria, dysphagia, and pseudobulbar affect; median survival drops to 18 months if bulbar onset.\n\nSystemic manifestations include weight loss >10% baseline in 60% due to hypermetabolism and dysphagia. Severity is graded using the ALS Functional Rating Scale\u2013Revised (ALSFRS-R), where a drop from 40 to 30 indicates moderate disability. Red flags against ALS are prominent sensory loss or sphincter dysfunction. Without treatment, median survival is 36 months, with 5-year survival under 10%.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on mixed UMN and LMN signs in >1 region over >3 months. Step 2: Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) showing denervation (fibrillations, positive sharp waves) in \u22652 limbs or brainstem with sensitivity 85% and specificity 98%. Step 3: Laboratory tests to exclude mimics: creatine kinase (CK) up to 10,000 U/L; normal CK <200 U/L. Rule out hypothyroidism (TSH 0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L), B12 deficiency (>200 pg/mL), HIV, HTLV-1. Step 4: MRI brain and spinal cord with T2-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging; look for corticospinal tract hyperintensity in 60% of ALS patients.\n\nStep 5: CSF analysis if suspicion of inflammatory neuropathy: normal cell count (0\u20135 cells/\u00b5L), protein 15\u201345 mg/dL, glucose 2.5\u20134.5 mmol/L. Oligoclonal bands absent in ALS. Step 6: Genetic testing for C9ORF72 expansions in familial cases (penetrance ~80% by age 70), and TARDBP, SOD1, FUS panels. Step 7: Muscle biopsy rarely required; reveals group atrophy and fiber-type grouping in chronic cases.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include multifocal motor neuropathy (anti-GM1 antibodies positive in 40%), cervical spondylotic myelopathy (MRI compression), spinal muscular atrophy (SMN1 gene in children), and Kennedy disease (SMC1A CAG repeat in males). Distinguishing features: sensory preservation, normal conduction velocities, absence of demyelination on NCS.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy includes riluzole 50 mg orally twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/dose if weight <70 kg), which extends median survival by 2\u20133 months and slows ALSFRS-R decline by 30% over 12 months. Edaravone infusion is given as 60 mg IV daily for 14 days, then 60 mg daily for 10 days each 14-day cycle; it reduces functional decline by 33% at 24 weeks. Both drugs require hepatic function monitoring (ALT/AST every month) and dose adjustment in Child\u2013Pugh B or C cirrhosis.\n\nSecond-line options in clinical trials include masitinib 6 mg/kg/day orally and anti-sense oligonucleotides targeting SOD1 (BIIB067) given intrathecally. Non-pharmacological interventions: non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP improves one-year survival by 45% when FVC falls below 50%; percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for malnutrition (BMI <18.5) reduces aspiration pneumonia by 25%. Physiotherapy protocols (30-minute sessions thrice weekly) maintain joint mobility and reduce spasticity.\n\nDrug interactions: avoid CYP1A2 inducers with riluzole. Contraindications include active hepatitis. Palliative care may involve opioids for dyspnea. Special populations: pregnant women may use riluzole with caution after first trimester; dose adjustments in creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits are scheduled every three months or sooner if rapid progression occurs. At each visit, monitor ALSFRS-R score (target slowing decline to <1.0 point/month), forced vital capacity (FVC) measured by spirometry (target \u226570% predicted), and weight (target BMI \u226520 kg/m2). Laboratory surveillance includes liver function tests monthly on riluzole and edaravone, serum electrolytes quarterly.\n\nImaging is repeated only if clinical picture changes suggest radiculopathy or other mimics. Long-term complications occur in 25% of patients within one year (aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure) and in 75% by five years. Rehabilitation planning includes speech therapy for dysarthria by visit two, swallow evaluation by visit three, and home ventilation assessment when FVC <50% predicted.\n\nPrognosis: one-year survival 85%, three-year 50%, five-year 20%. Patient education focuses on assistive devices, emergency contact for choking, and advance directives. Driving should cease when reaction time slows >0.5 seconds or FVC <70%.

APP. The amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) is responsible for familial early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (EOAD) in younger patients. Goate et al. (1991) first identified a missense mutation in APP segregating with EOAD, establishing APP as a causal gene. In contrast, TREM refers to TREM2, a risk-modifying gene for late-onset AD with an odds ratio of approximately 2\u20134 but not a primary causative gene in early-onset cases (Guerreiro et al. 2013). Ubiquitin accumulation is a hallmark of neurofibrillary tangles but represents a protein post-translationally modified in AD rather than a causative gene. \u201cEPO4\u201d has no validated association with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. According to NIA\u2013AA diagnostic guidelines (McKhann et al. 2011), genetic testing in EOAD should focus on APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations.","conceptual_foundation":"Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) in DSM-5-TR is classified under Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In ICD-11, AD is coded as 6D80. Early-onset familial AD (EOFAD) occurs before age 65, often in the 30s\u201350s, showing autosomal dominant inheritance with APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations. The APP gene on chromosome 21 encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein subject to proteolytic processing pathways. Embryologically, APP expression in neural crest\u2013derived neurons begins in early development, influencing synaptogenesis. Neuroanatomically, APP processing dysfunction leads to hippocampal and parietal lobe pathology, manifesting as memory and visuospatial impairment. Differential diagnoses include frontotemporal dementia, vascular cognitive impairment, and Down syndrome in trisomy 21 (APP gene dosage).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, APP undergoes \u03b1-secretase cleavage within the A\u03b2 domain, precluding amyloidogenic peptide formation. In the amyloidogenic pathway, \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase (including presenilin subunits) produce A\u03b2 peptides, particularly A\u03b242, which aggregate into oligomers and plaques. Mutations in APP near the \u03b2- or \u03b3-secretase sites increase the A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio, accelerating oligomerization. Aggregated A\u03b242 initiates tau hyperphosphorylation via kinases such as GSK-3\u03b2, forming neurofibrillary tangles. Oligomeric A\u03b2 species disrupt synaptic plasticity, induce microglial activation through TLRs and complement, and drive chronic neuroinflammation. Over decades, compensatory synaptic sprouting fails, resulting in synaptic loss, neuronal death, and cortical atrophy, particularly in the hippocampus and temporoparietal regions.","clinical_manifestation":"EOFAD due to APP mutations typically presents in the fourth or fifth decade, with initial episodic memory deficits, impaired visuospatial skills, and executive dysfunction. Visual-spatial deficits may include topographic disorientation and constructional apraxia. Language and behavioral changes are less prominent early. Disease progression is more rapid than sporadic AD, with median survival of approximately 8 years post-onset (Farrer et al. 1997). Subtypes of EOAD include amnestic, posterior cortical atrophy, and logopenic variants. Uniformly, cognitive impairment is accompanied by insidious onset and steady decline, with seizures occurring in up to 10\u201322% of EOFAD patients (Tampellini et al. 2020).","diagnostic_approach":"In a patient younger than 65 with an AD phenotype, the workup includes structural MRI to assess medial temporal atrophy (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~80%) and exclude alternative causes. CSF biomarkers show decreased A\u03b242 (sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%) and increased total tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181) (sensitivity 90%, specificity 90%) per AAN guidelines (Blennow et al. 2010). Amyloid PET imaging demonstrates cortical uptake (sensitivity 96%, specificity 92%). Genetic testing for APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations is recommended when there is a strong family history or onset before age 60, according to ACMG guidelines. Pre-test probability is ~50% in familial EOAD; positive predictive value exceeds 90%.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy is specifically approved for APP mutation carriers. Symptomatic treatment includes cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine) with modest cognitive benefits (NNT=12 for minimal improvement at 6 months) and memantine for moderate to severe stages. Clinical trials targeting A\u03b2 include BACE inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies such as aducanumab, which reduces amyloid plaque burden by ~25% at 1 year with mixed clinical outcomes. Genetic counseling is essential for affected families. Supportive care involves cognitive rehabilitation, occupational therapy, and caregiver support. Emerging therapies\u2014anti-tau agents, gene silencing\u2014are under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 6 months should include cognitive testing (MMSE, MoCA) and functional assessments (ADAS-Cog). Annual MRI can monitor atrophy progression. Laboratory monitoring is not routinely required unless on trial or medications with lab effects. Monitor treatment adverse events (nausea, bradycardia with cholinesterase inhibitors; dizziness with memantine). Long-term planning should address legal and financial counseling, advanced directives, and caregiver respite.
