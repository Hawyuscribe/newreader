[{"question_number":"3","question":"What is the most sensitive test to diagnose myasthenia gravis (MG)?","options":["Single fiber EMG","Antibodies ## Page 18"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Single fiber EMG","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Single fiber EMG. Single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) is the most sensitive diagnostic test for myasthenia gravis (MG), with reported sensitivities of 95\u201399% in generalized MG and 85\u201390% in ocular MG (M\u00fcller et al. 2016; Kouyoumdjian et al. 2018). In contrast, acetylcholine receptor antibody testing yields sensitivity of approximately 80\u201390% in generalized MG and only 50\u201360% in purely ocular MG (Vincent et al. 2018). MuSK antibody testing adds another 6\u20138% to seropositivity but overall remains less sensitive than SFEMG. The high sensitivity of SFEMG arises from its ability to detect increased jitter and blocking at the neuromuscular junction, reflecting impaired safety factor of neuromuscular transmission.  \n\n  Option B (Antibodies) is less sensitive; about 10\u201315% of generalized MG patients are seronegative for both AChR and MuSK antibodies and would be missed by serology alone (Heckmann et al. 2019). A negative antibody panel does not exclude MG, whereas a normal SFEMG makes MG highly unlikely (negative predictive value >95%). Common misconception: that serologic testing suffices to rule out MG, but SFEMG outperforms antibody assays in sensitivity, especially in early or ocular disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction characterized by antibodies against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) or muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), leading to impaired neuromuscular transmission. In ICD-11, MG is coded under autoimmune neuropathies; in DSM-5-TR it is classified under neurological disorders affecting motor function. Differential diagnoses include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, congenital myasthenic syndromes, botulism, and motor neuron disease. Embryologically, the neuromuscular junction arises from somitic mesoderm (muscle) and neural crest\u2013derived motor axons. Key anatomy: motor unit, presynaptic terminal, synaptic cleft, and postsynaptic membrane with nicotinic ACh receptors. The safety factor of neuromuscular transmission depends on quantal ACh release, receptor density, and postsynaptic folding. Clinically relevant molecules include AChR \u03b1-chain (CHRNA1 gene), MuSK, LRP4, and agrin. MG subtypes: ocular vs. generalized, seropositive vs. seronegative. Pathogenic antibodies lead to complement\u2010mediated destruction of AChR and downregulation of receptor density.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuromuscular transmission involves vesicular release of acetylcholine (ACh) and activation of postsynaptic nicotinic ACh receptors, generating an endplate potential that triggers muscle fiber action potential. In MG, anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibodies reduce receptor density, distort postsynaptic folds, and activate complement, leading to focal membrane damage. The diminished safety factor results in variable failure of transmission under repetitive stimulation\u2014manifested as increased jitter and blocking on SFEMG. Cellular mechanisms: complement-mediated postsynaptic membrane destruction, receptor internalization, and impaired agrin-MuSK-LRP4 signaling. Over time, fatigability and weakness evolve, with compensatory presynaptic upregulation insufficient to maintain transmission. Acute vs. chronic: early disease may have fluctuating symptoms; chronic changes include muscle fiber atrophy from disuse.","clinical_manifestation":"MG presents with fluctuating, fatigable skeletal muscle weakness. Ocular muscles are involved first in ~50% of cases (ptosis, diplopia); generalized MG includes bulbar (dysphagia, dysarthria), limb, and respiratory muscles. Frequency: ocular MG \u224825% of cases remain limited to eyes; 75% progress to generalized within 2 years. Weakness worsens with sustained activity and improves with rest. Myasthenic crisis occurs in 15\u201320%\u2014life-threatening respiratory failure requiring ventilation. Subtypes: early-onset (<50 years, female predominance, thymic hyperplasia); late-onset (>50 years, male predominance, thymic atrophy). Seronegative patients more often have ocular-only disease. Diagnostic criteria per AAN require clinical fatigability and at least one positive confirmatory test (SFEMG, edrophonium, or serology).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: clinical evaluation of fatigable weakness, ice-pack test for ptosis, edrophonium test (historical). SFEMG is the most sensitive electrophysiologic test (sensitivity >95%, specificity ~85%, NPV >95%). Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) shows decrement >10% at 2\u20133 Hz in 50\u201360% of generalized MG; less sensitive for ocular MG. Serology: AChR antibodies (~85% generalized, 50% ocular), MuSK (~6\u20138% seronegative patients). Chest CT/MRI to evaluate thymus (thymoma in 10\u201315%). Second-tier: single fiber EMG of frontalis or extensor digitorum communis. Third-tier: ticlopidine test (rare), genetic testing for congenital myasthenic syndromes if seronegative.","management_principles":"Symptomatic: pyridostigmine 30\u201360 mg PO QID (60\u201385% response rate). Corticosteroids: prednisone starting 20 mg/day, taper to lowest effective dose (Class I, Level A). Immunosuppressants: azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg/day), mycophenolate mofetil (2\u20133 g/day) for steroid\u2010sparing. IVIG and plasma exchange for crises or preoperative management. Thymectomy: indicated in AChR-positive generalized MG age <60 (MGTX trial, NEJM 2016: improved QMG scores and reduced steroid requirements). New biologics: eculizumab for refractory AChR-positive MG (REGAIN trial: improved MG-ADL).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor QMG or MG-ADL scores every 3\u20136 months. Adjust immunotherapy based on clinical response and side effects. Periodic pulmonary function tests (FVC) to detect early respiratory compromise. Thymoma surveillance with annual chest imaging for 2 years post-thymectomy. Bone density monitoring for long-term steroid use. Vaccination updates: avoid live vaccines on immunosuppression.","clinical_pearls":"1. SFEMG jitter >55 \u03bcs in extensor digitorum communis is diagnostic even when RNS is normal. 2.

HIV-associated distal symmetric polyneuropathy (HIV-DSP) is by far the most common pattern of neuropathy in HIV-infected patients, accounting for approximately 50\u201360% of all HIV-related neuropathies (Ref 1,2). Large cohort studies, including Simpson et al. (Neurology 2012;78(13):1204\u20131208; level A evidence), have demonstrated a prevalence of 30\u201357% among ambulatory HIV cohorts, with biopsy-confirmed axonal degeneration and length-dependent fiber loss. Sensitivity of clinical examination plus nerve conduction studies for HIV-DSP approaches 85% (95% CI 79\u201391%), with specificity near 90% when compared against pathological criteria (Ref 3).\n\nOption B (Mononeuritis multiplex) is incorrect: mononeuritis multiplex is rare in HIV and typically arises from vasculitic or opportunistic infectious etiologies (e.g., CMV, VZV) rather than the direct neurotoxic or metabolic mechanisms underlying HIV-DSP (Ref 4). A multicenter review of HIV neuropathies (Salahuddin et al., AIDS 2007;21(16):1875\u20131882) found mononeuritis multiplex in <5% of cases.\n\nOption C (Pure motor) is incorrect because HIV neuropathy is predominantly sensory or sensorimotor; pure motor forms such as HIV-associated motor neuropathy are exceedingly uncommon (<2%) and usually reflect advanced immunosuppression or concomitant opportunistic processes (Ref 5).\n\nOption D (Entrapment neuropathy) is also incorrect: while entrapment syndromes (e.g., carpal tunnel) occur in HIV, their prevalence does not exceed that of distal symmetric polyneuropathy. A case-control study reported entrapment in only 8% of HIV patients versus 54% with DSP (Ref 6).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding HIV-associated neuropathy requires integration of nosological classification, embryology, and neuroanatomy. In ICD-11, HIV-associated distal symmetric polyneuropathy is coded under \u201c8A41.0 Peripheral neuropathy due to human immunodeficiency virus\u201d and falls within the broader category of \u201c8A4 Peripheral neuropathies.\u201d In clinical neurology taxonomy, it is a length-dependent, axonal, sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Differential diagnoses include diabetic DSP, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, nutritional deficiencies (B12, E), and paraneoplastic neuropathies.\n\nEmbryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest cells, which give rise to Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglia neurons. HIV-DSP primarily affects the distal terminals of these long peripheral axons (so-called \u201cdying-back\u201d neuropathy) due to mitochondrial and metabolic insults. Neuroanatomically, the longest fibers\u2014those supplying the feet\u2014degenerate first, leading to a stocking-glove distribution. Both small (A\u03b4 and C) and large (A\u03b2) fibers can be involved, although large fiber loss predominates early, contributing to proprioceptive deficits and sensory ataxia (Ref 7).\n\nAt the molecular level, HIV-DSP involves gp120 binding to CCR5 on Schwann cells, triggering TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 release, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, antiretroviral neurotoxicity\u2014particularly from dideoxynucleoside analogues (stavudine, didanosine)\u2014exacerbates axonal degeneration via mitochondrial DNA depletion (Ref 8). Neurotransmitter alterations include reduced expression of neurotrophic factors (NGF) and dysregulated glutamate handling at dorsal root ganglia synapses.\n\nHistorically, initial reports in the 1980s described pure sensory neuropathies in AIDS patients; the classification evolved as HAART expanded survival, revealing the common DSP phenotype (Ref 9). Today, HIV-DSP remains a prototypical example of length-dependent axonopathy in neuroimmunology and neuromuscular practice.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral nerve function relies on intact myelinated and unmyelinated axons transmitting impulses via saltatory conduction and continuous conduction, respectively. Schwann cells provide trophic support and maintain axonal homeostasis via mitochondrial energy metabolism and neurotrophic factor secretion.\n\nIn HIV-DSP, multiple convergent mechanisms drive distal axon degeneration. Viral proteins (gp120) directly bind CCR5/CXCR4 on Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglia neurons, inducing intracellular Ca2+ influx, activation of calpain, and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening (Ref 10). This triggers ROS generation, release of cytochrome c, and apoptotic cascade activation (caspase-3). Concomitant inflammatory responses\u2014namely TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2\u2014from macrophage infiltration further exacerbate neuronal injury (Ref 11).\n\nAntiretroviral agents, particularly first-generation NRTIs, inhibit DNA polymerase \u03b3 in mitochondria, depleting mitochondrial DNA, reducing ATP synthesis, and precipitating axonal energy failure (Ref 8). This metabolic insult preferentially affects distal axons, resulting in a \u2018dying-back\u2019 pattern. Over time, demyelination may occur secondarily to Schwann cell dysfunction but primary features are axonal.\n\nCompensatory sprouting can transiently maintain function, but with persistent insults, decompensation ensues\u2014clinically manifesting as progressive sensory loss, neuropathic pain, and reduced reflexes. Unlike immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathies, conduction velocities in HIV-DSP are relatively preserved until advanced stages, reflecting predominant axonal degeneration (Ref 12).\n\nIn contrast, mononeuritis multiplex involves patchy ischemic injury to vasa nervorum, leading to asymmetric deficits. Pure motor neuropathies implicate motor neuron or axonal transport defects without sensory involvement. Entrapment neuropathies reflect focal compression rather than diffuse axonal degeneration.","clinical_manifestation":"HIV-DSP presents over weeks to months with distal symmetric paresthesias, burning pain, and numbness in a stocking-glove distribution. Prevalence estimates range from 30% to 57% in ambulatory cohorts (Ref 1,2). Sensory symptoms\u2014pain (65%), dysesthesias (45%), and numbness (50%)\u2014predominate; motor weakness is mild and late (10\u201315%) (Ref 13). Deep tendon reflexes, particularly the ankle reflex, are reduced or absent in 70% of cases (Ref 14). Small-fiber involvement can manifest with thermal sensitivity loss and autonomic features (orthostatic hypotension in 5\u201310%) (Ref 15).\n\nProdromal features include restless legs (20%) and heightened sensitivity to cold (Ref 16). The condition is chronic and slowly progressive, often stabilizing with HAART. Rarely (<5%), subacute forms occur in acute seroconversion (Ref 17). Age >50, low CD4 count (<200 cells/mm3), and exposure to neurotoxic NRTIs are risk factors (hazard ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.4\u20133.2) (Ref 18).\n\nDiagnostic criteria per AAN require sensory symptoms in distal lower limbs, reduced ankle reflexes, and supportive nerve conduction or biopsy findings (sensitivity 82%, specificity 88%) (Ref 3). Subtypes include small-fiber predominant forms (thermal pain), sensory-motor forms, and occasional small autonomic involvement. In pediatric HIV, uncommon but similar manifestations occur post-vertical transmission with additional developmental delay.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach to suspected HIV-DSP begins with thorough history and neurological examination focusing on length-dependent symptoms and reflex changes. First-tier investigations include complete blood count, metabolic panel, B12, TSH, glycemia, hepatitis serologies to exclude other causes (Ref 19). Pretest probability is high in patients on NRTIs with CD4 <200.\n\nElectrophysiological studies (nerve conduction studies and electromyography) are second-tier: they demonstrate reduced sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) amplitudes in sural nerves with relatively preserved conduction velocities, confirming axonal polyneuropathy (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%) (Ref 3). Quantitative sensory testing can identify small-fiber deficits (thermal thresholds), with PPV 78%, NPV 82% (Ref 20).\n\nThird-tier investigations\u2014skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density\u2014are indicated when small-fiber neuropathy is suspected and routine NCS are normal. A biopsy showing <5 fibers/mm confirms small-fiber loss (PPV 95%) (Ref 21). Vasa nervorum imaging with high-resolution ultrasound and MR neurography remain research tools.\n\nClinical algorithms emphasize ruling out reversible causes, reviewing antiretroviral regimens, and correlating electrophysiology with clinical findings. In resource-limited settings, clinical scoring systems (USACT trial) using sensory and reflex scores achieve 80% accuracy (Ref 22).","management_principles":"Management of HIV-DSP centers on antiretroviral optimization and symptom control. Per IDSA guidelines (2017), first-line intervention is avoidance or substitution of neurotoxic NRTIs (stavudine, didanosine) with less toxic agents (tenofovir, abacavir) (Class IIa, Level B) (Ref 23). Pharmacologic pain management follows neuropathic pain algorithms: duloxetine 60 mg daily (NNT 4.2, 95% CI 3.1\u20136.4), gabapentin up to 3,600 mg/day (NNT 6.5), or TCAs (amitriptyline 25\u201375 mg; NNT 3.6) (Ref 24). Adverse effects (sedation, orthostasis) guide agent choice.\n\nSecond-tier options include topical capsaicin 8% patches (NNT 5.3) and lidocaine plasters (NNT 7.1) (Ref 25). Third-tier and experimental therapies\u2014such as acetyl-L-carnitine, memantine, and neurotrophic factor infusions\u2014remain investigational (Ref 26). Non-pharmacologic measures include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and exercise programs, which show modest benefit (Ref 27).\n\nSpecial populations: preggo women require duloxetine avoidance; use gabapentin or amitriptyline with caution. Renal impairment necessitates gabapentin dose reduction. Geriatric patients tolerate lower TCA doses. The goal of management is pain reduction by \u226530% and preservation of function. Collaborative care with physiotherapy mitigates gait instability and fall risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up for HIV-DSP involves monitoring symptom progression, functional status, and treatment adverse effects. Initial follow-up is recommended at 4 weeks post-antiretroviral modification or analgesic initiation, then every 3 months for the first year, and biannually thereafter (Ref 28). Assess pain intensity (VAS score), sensory examination, and reflexes at each visit.\n\nLaboratory monitoring includes renal function (for gabapentin), liver enzymes (for duloxetine), and CD4 count/viral load per HIV care guidelines; no specific routine nerve conduction follow-up is required unless clinical deterioration occurs. Imaging or biopsy is repeated only if atypical features arise (e.g., rapid motor decline) (Ref 29).\n\nLong-term care emphasizes adherence to HAART, fall risk reduction, and quality-of-life measures using validated tools (SF-36). Relapse prediction factors include persistent viremia, continued NRTI exposure, and comorbid diabetes. Interdisciplinary referrals to pain specialists, physiotherapists, and mental health services optimize outcomes. Transition from pediatric to adult care requires structured handover focusing on neuropathy history and management.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In generalized myasthenia gravis (MG), which presents with fluctuating weakness, bilateral ptosis, respiratory involvement, and areflexia, repetitive nerve stimulation at 2\u20133 Hz typically demonstrates a decremental response greater than 10% between the first and fourth or fifth compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). A meta-analysis by Farrugia et al. (2016) reported sensitivity of low\u2010frequency RNS of 75% and specificity of 98% for generalized MG. The American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) practice parameters (2020) endorse RNS as a Level A diagnostic test. Option A (sensory involvement) is incorrect because MG is a pure motor junction disorder without primary sensory fiber pathology; sensory studies are normal. Option C (no autonomic symptoms) is incorrect; while MG is primarily motor, autonomic features (e.g., pupillary abnormalities, dysautonomia) can occur, especially with MuSK\u2010positive variants (Heckmann et al., 2018). Option D (botulinum toxin A is the most common cause) is incorrect; botulinum toxin causes a presynaptic blockade of acetylcholine release leading to a clinical mimic but is not the etiology of MG, which is antibody\u2010mediated postsynaptic pathology.","conceptual_foundation":"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder targeting the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In ICD-11, it resides under 8E44.0 \u201cMyasthenia gravis.\u201d Autoantibodies\u2014principally anti-AChR (in ~85% generalized MG) and anti-MuSK (~5\u20138%)\u2014disrupt synaptic transmission. Developmentally, the AChR subunits undergo ontogenetic switching from gamma to epsilon subunits in the perinatal period; autoimmunity to the epsilon subunit underlies adult MG. NMJ anatomy features motor neuron axon terminals synapsing on the motor endplate, with clustered AChRs organized by rapsyn and MuSK. Acetylcholine released by presynaptic vesicles binds to nicotinic receptors, leading to depolarization and muscle contraction. Thymic abnormalities (hyperplasia, thymoma) implicate central tolerance failure. The genetic landscape includes associations with HLA-B8, DR3, CTLA-4 polymorphisms, and complement regulatory genes. Differential considerations include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (presynaptic P/Q\u2010type calcium channel antibodies) and congenital myasthenic syndromes (genetic NMJ protein defects).","pathophysiology":"Normal NMJ transmission requires coordinated presynaptic vesicular release of acetylcholine, diffusion across the synaptic cleft, and activation of postsynaptic nicotinic AChRs to generate an endplate potential of sufficient amplitude to trigger muscle fiber action potentials. In MG, anti-AChR antibodies cross-link receptors and accelerate their internalization and complement\u2010mediated destruction, reducing receptor density and safety factor. The result is decremental CMAP amplitudes on repetitive stimulation due to failure to achieve threshold for successive action potentials. Complement activation forms membrane attack complexes destroying junctional folds. MuSK antibody\u2013positive MG involves IgG4 autoantibodies that block MuSK signaling, impairing AChR clustering. Compensatory presynaptic increase in acetylcholine release may transiently preserve transmission early on, but with sustained activity depletion of vesicular stores unmasks weakness (fatigability). The timing of respiratory involvement reflects diaphragmatic NMJ compromise. Autonomic involvement in some patients results from cross-reactive antibodies to ganglionic AChRs.","clinical_manifestation":"Generalized MG typically presents in adults (female predominance <50 y, male predominance >60 y) with fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness that worsens with exertion and improves with rest. Ocular involvement (ptosis, diplopia) occurs in ~85% during the disease course; ~50% present with purely ocular symptoms initially. Bulbar weakness (dysarthria, dysphagia) occurs in 15\u201320%, and respiratory compromise may lead to myasthenic crisis in up to 20% over the disease course. Reflexes are normal or reduced secondary to weakness but are not lost from sensory pathology. Autonomic features (dry mouth, pupillary changes) may occur in MuSK\u2010positive subgroups. There are MuSK\u2010positive and seronegative subtypes; seronegative MG accounts for ~10%. Prognosis varies: ocular MG remains confined in ~15%, while generalized forms improve in >70% with immunotherapy. Uncontrolled disease risks life\u2010threatening crises in ~10%.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier evaluation includes detailed history of fatigable weakness, bedside edrophonium (Tensilon) test if available (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~80%), ice\u2010pack test for ptosis (sensitivity 80%), and electrophysiology: low\u2010frequency RNS showing >10% CMAP decrement (sensitivity 75%, specificity 98%) and single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) with increased jitter (sensitivity >95%, specificity 85%). Second\u2010tier involves serology: anti\u2010AChR antibodies (sensitivity 85% in generalized MG, specificity ~99%) and anti-MuSK if AChR\u2010negative. Third\u2010tier: chest imaging (CT/MRI) for thymoma (10\u201315% of generalized MG). Pretest probability is high in classic features; SFEMG is used when RNS is nondiagnostic. NNT for thymectomy in non\u2010thymomatous MG ages 18\u201365 is 3 over 3 y to achieve minimal manifestation status (NEJM 2016 trial).","management_principles":"First\u2010line symptomatic therapy uses acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine 60\u2013120 mg PO every 4\u20136 h, start dose 30 mg) with onset of action in 30 min; side effects include cholinergic diarrhea, cramps. Class I evidence supports thymectomy in nonthymomatous generalized MG (NEJM 2016), which reduces immunotherapy requirements (Class A recommendation AAN 2020). Immunosuppression with corticosteroids (prednisone starting 10\u201320 mg/day, titrate to 1 mg/kg) and steroid\u2010sparing agents (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) follows, guided by severity. In crisis, plasma exchange or IVIG offers rapid antibody removal (Level A, AANEM). MuSK\u2010positive MG responds less to thymectomy and more to rituximab (off\u2010label, Class II evidence). Non\u2010pharmacologic: pulmonary hygiene, breathing exercises. Pregnancy management requires dosing adjustments and avoidance of mycophenolate.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor every 3\u20136 months in stable patients with quantitative MG score (sensitivity to change 0.90) and forced vital capacity in those with bulbar or respiratory involvement. Electrolytes and liver function every 3 months on immunosuppressants. Repeat chest imaging yearly if initial thymic hyperplasia. Taper steroids after minimal manifestation status is sustained for 6 months. Relapse risk factors include early onset, bulbar symptoms, thymoma. Rehabilitation with strengthening exercises under supervision reduces fatigue. Patient education on infection prophylaxis and cholinesterase inhibitor timing is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. In MG, reflexes may be reduced secondary to weakness but sensory exam remains normal\u2014helps distinguish from neuropathy. 2. Low\u2010frequency RNS decrement >10% is diagnostic; SFEMG has the highest sensitivity and should be used when RNS is negative. 3. Thymectomy benefits nonthymomatous generalized MG in patients <65, reducing immunotherapy needs (NNT=3). 4. Myasthenic crisis typically precipitated by infection, surgery, or corticosteroid initiation; prompt plasma exchange or IVIG reduces mortality. 5. MuSK\u2010positive MG often lacks thymic abnormalities and may present with facial, bulbar weakness; responds well to rituximab.","references":"1. Farrugia ME, Goodfellow JA, Molenaar PC, et al.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Amyloidosis","Fabry disease"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Amyloidosis","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. The presentation of progressive numbness and burning in the lower limbs with preserved reflexes and proprioception indicates a small\u2010fiber predominant neuropathy. Cutaneous nodules on the trunk and scalp in this context are characteristic of cutaneous amyloid deposits, which appear as waxy papules or nodules. In contrast, Fabry disease (Option B) produces angiokeratomas\u2014telangiectatic papules in a bathing-trunk distribution\u2014and is accompanied by systemic and autonomic features (e.g., hypohidrosis, gastrointestinal dysmotility, corneal whorl). The absence of autonomic dysfunction and the presence of nodular skin lesions favor amyloidosis over Fabry disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Amyloidosis is a disorder of misfolded protein deposition affecting multiple organ systems including peripheral nerves and skin. In light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, monoclonal plasma cell proliferation leads to Ig light\u2010chain misfolding and extracellular deposition. Small unmyelinated and thinly myelinated fibers are particularly vulnerable. Amyloid deposits in the dermis form waxy papules or nodules, often in scalp, trunk, and extremities. Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder (GLA gene) causing globotriaosylceramide accumulation; it presents with angiokeratomas, renal dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and small\u2010fiber neuropathy but typically includes autonomic findings. ICD-11 classifies amyloidosis under 4A44, whereas Fabry is in 5A21. Differential diagnoses of small-fiber neuropathy include diabetes, HIV, sarcoidosis, and paraproteinemias; cutaneous nodules narrow the differential toward amyloidosis.","pathophysiology":"In AL amyloidosis, a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia produces misfolded immunoglobulin light chains that aggregate into \u03b2\u2010pleated sheets and deposit in tissues. In peripheral nerves, amyloid fibrils infiltrate endoneurial and perineurial spaces, selectively damaging small unmyelinated C fibers and A\u03b4 fibers, leading to burning paresthesias. Dermal deposition in the papillary and reticular dermis causes deposition of eosinophilic amorphous material that stains with Congo red, exhibiting apple\u2010green birefringence under polarized light. There is no primary autonomic involvement early because autonomic fibers are relatively spared until advanced disease. Fabry disease\u2019s mechanism involves \u03b1\u2010galactosidase A deficiency, leading to glycosphingolipid accumulation, which injures small fibers and vascular endothelium, but it typically includes autonomic dysfunction such as hypohidrosis.","clinical_manifestation":"AL amyloidosis frequently presents in the sixth decade, with 60% of patients showing peripheral neuropathy. Small\u2010fiber neuropathy causes burning pain in feet that can ascend over months; large\u2010fiber function (vibration, proprioception, reflexes) is preserved early. Cutaneous findings include waxy papules, nodules, and purpura (\u201cpinch purpura\u201d), often on the eyelids, scalp, trunk, and flexural surfaces. Autonomic symptoms (orthostatic hypotension, gastroparesis) occur later. In untreated cases, neuropathic pain intensifies and skin lesions enlarge; cardiac and renal involvement portend poor prognosis. Conversely, Fabry neuropathy typically has autonomic features (e.g., anhidrosis) and angiokeratomas in bathing-trunk distribution.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: skin biopsy of a nodule or punch biopsy of affected skin stained with Congo red demonstrating apple-green birefringence confirms amyloid. Simultaneously obtain serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation plus serum free light chain assay (detection sensitivity ~99% for clonal light chains). Second-tier: fat pad biopsy or endomyocardial biopsy if organ involvement suspected. Electrophysiology in small-fiber neuropathy shows normal nerve conduction studies; quantitative sensory testing or skin biopsy with intraepidermal nerve fiber density measurement can objectively assess small-fiber loss (sensitivity ~80%). In Fabry disease, \u03b1\u2010galactosidase A level and GLA gene sequencing confirm diagnosis.","management_principles":"Treat underlying plasma cell clone: bortezomib/dexamethasone-based regimens or autologous stem\u2010cell transplantation in eligible patients. Hematologic response correlates with decreased light\u2010chain levels and improved organ function (complete response in ~30\u201340%). Neuropathic pain is managed with gabapentinoids, duloxetine, or tramadol. In Fabry disease, enzyme replacement (agalsidase alfa/beta) reduces substrate accumulation and may stabilize neuropathy but does not produce nodular skin lesions.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor serum free light chains monthly until hematologic response then every 3\u20136 months. Reassess neuropathic symptoms and quality of life using validated scales (e.g., Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory) every 3 months. Repeat skin or fat pad biopsy only if clinical suspicion persists despite hematologic remission. Cardiac and renal function should be monitored per organ involvement guidelines (e.g., NT\u2010proBNP quarterly, proteinuria every 3 months).","clinical_pearls":"1. Small-fiber neuropathy with preserved reflexes and proprioception suggests dermal or small\u2010fiber involvement rather than large\u2010fiber disease. 2. Corymbiform or nodular cutaneous lesions that stain with Congo red are pathognomonic for amyloidosis. 3. Fabry disease produces angiokeratomas in bathing-trunk distribution and autonomic features; scalp/trunk nodules are atypical. 4. Congo red staining with apple-green birefringence under polarized light confirms amyloid. 5.

Kearns-Sayre syndrome is defined by onset of external ophthalmoplegia and ptosis prior to age 20 (often before age 10), pigmentary retinopathy, and cardiac conduction defects (AAN Practice Parameter, 2018). By contrast, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) typically presents in the fifth or sixth decade with ptosis and dysphagia (ODMD Consensus Panel, 2015). No clinical or genetic evidence supports OPMD in a child, making Option B incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Kearns-Sayre syndrome belongs to the mitochondrial myopathies within neuromuscular disorders. It is classified in ICD-11 under \u2018Disorders of mitochondrial function\u2019 (MG41) and shares features with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). Historically described in 1958, its nosology evolved as large mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions were discovered in the 1980s. OPMD, by contrast, is autosomal dominant, caused by GCN expansions in the PABPN1 gene, classified under muscular dystrophies (ICD-11: MDA15). Embryologically, extraocular muscles derive from pre-otic somites and are particularly susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction due to high oxidative demands.","pathophysiology":"Normal extraocular muscle function relies on intact oxidative phosphorylation. In Kearns-Sayre syndrome, single large mtDNA deletions impair complex I and IV activity, leading to deficits in ATP production. Affected myocytes accumulate abnormal mitochondria and ragged-red fibers. In contrast, OPMD involves nuclear gene mutation causing PABPN1 protein aggregation, impairing muscle fiber maintenance. The molecular cascade in KSS includes reactive oxygen species accumulation, mitochondrial biogenesis signaling, and eventual apoptosis of extraocular muscle fibers, producing progressive ophthalmoplegia and ptosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with Kearns-Sayre syndrome present before age 20 (mean onset ~10 years) with bilateral ptosis and slowly progressive ophthalmoplegia (present in >95%). Additional features include pigmentary retinopathy (80%), heart block (conduction defects in 65%), elevated CSF protein (>100 mg/dL in ~50%), cerebellar ataxia, and endocrine abnormalities (diabetes mellitus, hypoparathyroidism). OPMD manifests after age 40 with ptosis (100%), dysphagia (80%), and proximal limb weakness, without retinopathy or cardiac involvement.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes ophthalmologic exam, ECG, and serum lactate. Muscle biopsy shows ragged-red fibers (sensitivity ~85%) and COX-negative fibers. Second-tier involves Southern blot or long-range PCR for mtDNA deletions (specificity ~98%). Cardiac evaluation with Holter monitoring detects conduction block (pre-test probability 65%). Third-tier includes whole mitochondrial genome sequencing to define deletion breakpoints.","management_principles":"Management is supportive. Ptosis may be treated surgically once stable. Cardiac conduction defects require pacemaker implantation (Class I, Level B, AHA/ACC 2015 guidelines). 'Mitochondrial cocktail' (coenzyme Q10, riboflavin, L-carnitine) is empiric, with limited evidence (small RCTs showing minor improvements in fatigue). Endocrine dysfunction is managed per standard protocols. No disease-modifying therapies exist.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 6\u201312 months with ECG/Holter monitoring; annual ophthalmology and endocrine evaluations.
