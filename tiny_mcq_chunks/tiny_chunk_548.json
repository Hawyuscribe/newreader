Baclofen addresses baseline spasticity. Carbamazepine is effective for paroxysmal spasms and neuropathic pain in MS, improving quality of life (QOL) measures in RCTs (Ontaneda et al., 2018). Steroids target acute relapses and do not improve chronic symptoms. Antivirals have no role in MS. Pregabalin can help neuropathic pain but has less impact on spasticity and paroxysmal spasms compared to carbamazepine.","conceptual_foundation":"MS is an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder (ICD-11 8A40) characterized by chronic neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss. Secondary progressive MS features accumulating disability with spasticity and neuropathic pain as common sequelae. Paroxysmal spasms (e.g., tonic spasms) are frequently responsive to sodium channel blockers like carbamazepine.","pathophysiology":"In MS, demyelinated axons develop aberrant sodium channel expression (Nav1.6 upregulation) leading to ectopic impulse generation and paroxysmal spasms. Carbamazepine stabilizes inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, reducing high-frequency discharges and alleviating spasms and neuropathic pain.","clinical_manifestation":"Long-standing SPMS presents with severe spasticity, painful spasms, gait impairment, and neuropathic pain (burning, electric shocks). Paroxysmal symptoms include tonic spasms, Lhermitte\u2019s sign, and trigeminal neuralgia.

In patients with a clinically isolated syndrome or other presentations suspicious for MS but with no brain lesions on MRI, the long-term risk of developing MS over 10\u201315 years remains low, generally under 20%. Studies of radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) show that absence of brain lesions at baseline MRI corresponds to a low conversion rate to clinically definite MS\u2014approximately 10%\u201315% at 10 years. Option A (>50%) and B (20%\u201350%) overestimate risk. Option D (no risk) is incorrect because a small proportion still convert.","conceptual_foundation":"RIS describes individuals incidentally found to have MRI lesions typical for MS without clinical symptoms. Conversely, if no lesions are present on MRI in someone with nonspecific symptoms, the probability of MS conversion is low. The 2017 McDonald criteria require demonstration of dissemination in space and time, so absence of any lesions precludes diagnosis and portends low risk.","pathophysiology":"The formation of demyelinating lesions is an early event in MS. If none are visible on MRI, it suggests absence of subclinical inflammatory activity above the detection threshold. Without active lesion formation, axonal injury and subsequent clinical demyelination are unlikely over time.","clinical_manifestation":"These patients may have nonspecific symptoms (e.g., numbness) but no objective neurological deficits or MRI correlates.

Large case series and cohort studies report that approximately 70% of ATM lesions localize in the thoracic cord, particularly between T4 and T9. A retrospective multicenter study of 160 ATM patients (Jacob et al., 2017) found thoracic involvement in 68.8% of cases, cervical in 23.1%, and lumbar or sacral in fewer than 10%. Option A (cervical region) is less common, accounting for roughly one-quarter of cases; option C (lumbar) and option D (sacral) are rare (<5%) because the blood supply and watershed areas in the lower cord are less susceptible to the focal inflammatory events that characterize idiopathic ATM. Misconceptions arise when cervical sensory levels are emphasized clinically, but actual lesion localization on MRI shows thoracic predominance. No high-quality evidence supports a lumbar or sacral predilection in idiopathic ATM.","conceptual_foundation":"Idiopathic acute transverse myelitis is an inflammatory myelopathy of presumed autoimmune etiology that presents with a monophasic course of motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction. It is classified among immune-mediated demyelinating disorders in ICD-11 (8A40.3) and overlaps with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and multiple sclerosis in the differential. Embryologically, the spinal cord\u2019s vascular supply derives from the anterior spinal artery and paired posterior spinal arteries; watershed areas in the thoracic cord predispose to ischemic-like inflammatory injury. The thoracic enlargement corresponds to the T1\u2013T12 segments, accounting for the high frequency of lesions in this region. Neuroanatomically, the corticospinal tracts, dorsal columns, and spinothalamic tracts traverse the thoracic cord segments attacked by inflammatory cells. Molecularly, ATM involves perivascular infiltration of T cells, macrophages, and complement deposition, likely triggered by molecular mimicry against myelin antigens. Variations in HLA haplotypes (e.g., DRB1*15:01) confer increased susceptibility, linking idiopathic ATM to other CNS demyelinating disorders.","pathophysiology":"Normal spinal cord physiology relies on an intact myelin sheath for saltatory conduction, maintained by oligodendrocytes. In idiopathic ATM, an aberrant T-cell\u2013mediated immune response targets myelin proteins (e.g., myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein) and activates complement pathways. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) recruit macrophages that phagocytose myelin and damage oligodendrocytes. The thoracic cord\u2019s relative hypovascularity and narrow canal predispose to more severe edema and secondary ischemia. Acutely, inflammatory infiltrates cause conduction block, leading to motor weakness and sensory deficits. Subacutely, demyelination and axonal transection result in Wallerian degeneration below the lesion. Chronic changes include gliosis and residual cavitation. In contrast, cervical lesions may present more often with respiratory compromise, but the underlying immune mechanisms are the same. The molecular basis differs from compressive myelopathy, which lacks the perivascular inflammatory aggregates and circulating autoantibodies seen in ATM.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with thoracic ATM typically present over hours to days with bilateral lower extremity weakness (85\u201395%), a sensory level (80\u201390%), and sphincter dysfunction (50\u201375%). Pain at the lesion site is reported in up to 50%. Thoracic involvement often manifests as a bandlike dysesthesia around the trunk corresponding to the dermatome levels T4\u2013T8. Complete cord syndromes (motor, sensory, autonomic involvement) account for approximately 60% of cases, whereas partial or incomplete syndromes comprise the remainder. Prodromal viral-like illness appears in 30\u201340%. Without treatment, deficits stabilize over several weeks, but residual disability is common. In pediatric cases, presentation may mimic acute flaccid myelitis, requiring differentiation by MRI. Elderly patients often have more severe deficits and slower recovery. Formal diagnostic criteria (Transverse Myelitis Consortium Working Group, 2002) require bilateral sensorimotor signs, sensory level, MRI evidence of spinal cord inflammation, and exclusion of compressive lesions or alternative etiologies.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes MRI of the entire spine with and without gadolinium, which has a sensitivity of 96% for detecting spinal cord lesions in idiopathic ATM. Typical findings include hyperintense T2-weighted lesions extending over one to three vertebral segments. CSF analysis shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (50\u201360%) and elevated IgG index (40\u201350%), although normal CSF does not exclude the diagnosis. Oligoclonal bands are present in approximately 20%. Blood work should rule out infections (HIV, HTLV-1), systemic autoimmune diseases (ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-Ro/La), and paraneoplastic markers. Second-tier testing includes serum neuromyelitis optica IgG (anti-AQP4) and MOG antibodies in patients with optic neuritis or longitudinally extensive lesions. Evoked potentials (somatosensory, motor) may assess conduction block. In resource-limited settings, a focused MRI of the spinal segment corresponding to the clinical sensory level plus basic CSF analysis is acceptable, with referral for advanced testing if unclear. Historical approaches using myelography have been replaced by MRI due to superior sensitivity and safety.","management_principles":"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 5 days) is first-line therapy (AAN Level B evidence). If there is insufficient improvement at 7\u201310 days, plasma exchange (five exchanges over 10 days) is indicated (Class II evidence) and yields a 40\u201360% response rate. Oral steroid taper follows IV steroids over 4\u20136 weeks. In refractory cases, cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2) has been used off-label based on small case series. Supportive care addresses pain (gabapentinoids), spasticity (baclofen), and bladder dysfunction (intermittent catheterization). Rehabilitation begins early to prevent contractures and maintain function. Treatment guidelines from the Consortium Working Group (2002) and subsequent updates emphasize prompt immunotherapy within 4 weeks of onset to maximize recovery.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes neurologic examination and MRI at 3 and 6 months to monitor lesion resolution and screen for new lesions suggestive of MS. CSF oligoclonal bands repeated at 6 months may uncover subclinical intrathecal IgG synthesis. Annual MRI of brain and spinal cord is recommended for 2\u20133 years to detect new demyelinating events. Urodynamic studies should be repeated at 3 months if bladder dysfunction persists. Functional status is tracked using the Modified Rankin Scale and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Transition of care from acute neurologist to rehabilitation specialist and then to primary care should occur once deficits stabilize.","clinical_pearls":"1. Thoracic localization: The thoracic cord is most susceptible in idiopathic ATM due to its vascular watershed area\u2014recall 'T for Transverse myelitis = Thoracic predilection.' 2. MRI is diagnostic: Always obtain contrast-enhanced spinal MRI; normal imaging essentially excludes ATM. 3. Early steroids: High-dose IV methylprednisolone within 2 weeks of onset improves long-term outcome\u2014treat swiftly. 4. CSF OCBs: Presence of oligoclonal bands predicts higher risk of evolving MS; monitor patients closely. 5.
