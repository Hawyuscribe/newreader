Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of Tropheryma whipplei in tissue, most reliably by periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) staining of macrophages in a small bowel (jejunal) biopsy. CSF analysis can show nonspecific pleocytosis; PCR for T. whipplei in CSF may aid but lacks sensitivity. MRI may reveal hypothalamic or mesencephalic T2 hyperintensities but is not diagnostic. Hence, jejunal biopsy is the gold standard.","conceptual_foundation":"Whipple\u2019s disease (ICD-11 EB51.0) is a systemic infection by Tropheryma whipplei, often involving the intestine, joints, and CNS. Neurological involvement occurs in 20\u201340% of cases, often late, and can include supranuclear upgaze palsy, ophthalmoplegia, myorhythmia, cognitive decline, myoclonus, and dementia. Differential includes paraneoplastic syndromes, CJD, and neurosarcoidosis.","pathophysiology":"T. whipplei infects macrophages in the lamina propria, leading to villous atrophy, malabsorption, and PAS-positive foamy macrophages. CNS spread is via hematogenous macrophage trafficking. Deposits in the mesencephalon and brainstem disrupt ocular motor nuclei and masticatory pathways, producing oculomasticatory myorhythmia.","clinical_manifestation":"Initial GI symptoms: weight loss, diarrhea, arthralgias. Neurological signs appear months to years later: cognitive impairment, supranuclear gaze palsy, myorhythmia (1\u20133 Hz), oculofacial-skeletal rhythmic movements. Up to 50% have dementia at CNS onset.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: jejunal biopsy with PAS stain and PCR. Second-tier: CSF PCR for T. whipplei. MRI brain can help localize lesions but not confirm. Endoscopic duodenal biopsy yields high sensitivity (>95%).","management_principles":"Long\u2010term antibiotics are required. Recommended regimen: intravenous ceftriaxone (2g daily) for 14 days, followed by oral trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole for 12 months. Monitoring includes clinical exam, CSF PCR, and repeat imaging if needed.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurological and GI exams every 3\u20136 months for 2 years, then annually. Repeat CSF PCR at 6 and 12 months; jejunal biopsy only if relapse suspected.","clinical_pearls":"1) Oculomasticatory myorhythmia is pathognomonic for Whipple\u2019s disease. 2) PAS-positive macrophages on jejunal biopsy confirm diagnosis. 3) CNS Whipple\u2019s requires prolonged antibiotic therapy. 4) CSF PCR is supportive but not definitive. 5) Early GI symptoms may precede neurological signs by years.","references":"[1] Durand DV et al. \u2018Whipple\u2019s disease.

Lancet Neurol. 2006). Syphilis (option B) and Lyme disease (option C) can cause ocular inflammation but not the characteristic hemorrhages and vessel changes seen in cerebral malaria. HCV (option D) does not cause neuro-retinitis or coma.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral malaria is an encephalopathy due to microvascular sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in cerebral capillaries. Retinal examination in endemic settings aids diagnosis. The ICD-11 classifies cerebral malaria under B50.8, falciparum malaria with neurological complications.","pathophysiology":"P. falciparum\u2013infected erythrocytes express PfEMP1, bind to endothelial receptors (ICAM-1, EPCR), causing sequestration and microvascular obstruction. Subsequent hypoxia, blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, and inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) lead to cerebral edema and coma.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate that initiating acyclovir or valacyclovir within 72 hours of rash onset reduces PHN incidence by approximately 40\u201350% compared to placebo (Johnson et al., 2007; Whitley et al., 1996). Steroids given alone have not shown consistent PHN prevention (Wood et al., 1996). Carbamazepine and pregabalin are used to treat established neuropathic pain but do not prevent PHN when given acutely.","conceptual_foundation":"Herpes zoster arises from reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in dorsal root ganglia. Early viral replication drives nerve inflammation and subsequent central sensitization. Antivirals inhibit VZV DNA polymerase, reduce viral load, limit axonal damage, and decrease the risk of chronic neuropathic pain. PHN is classified under chronic neuropathic pain disorders (ICD-11 MG30.0).","pathophysiology":"Normal neuronal function is disrupted by VZV-induced ganglionitis, causing Wallerian degeneration and deafferentation. Antivirals blunt viral replication, reduce inflammation (lower TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), and prevent persistent ectopic discharges in damaged C-fibers. Without antivirals, ongoing proinflammatory cytokine release leads to central sensitization and PHN.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute herpes zoster presents with dermatomal rash and acute neuritic pain. PHN is defined as pain persisting >90 days after rash onset, with burning or electric shock\u2013like quality. Risk factors include age > 50, severe acute pain, and rash severity. Early antiviral therapy lowers both acute pain intensity and PHN risk across all risk strata.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of acute zoster is clinical. Laboratory confirmation by PCR is reserved for atypical cases. Pretest probability is high in older adults with unilateral dermatomal rash. Early therapy is indicated without waiting for confirmatory tests.","management_principles":"First-line prevention is oral acyclovir 800 mg five times daily \u00d7 7 days or valacyclovir 1 g three times daily \u00d7 7 days, started within 72 hours of rash (AAN guideline, 2014, Level A).

It increases parasite cell membrane permeability to calcium, causing rapid tetanic contraction and paralysis of adult worms. Albendazole has no activity against trematodes and is reserved for nematode infections. Rifampicin is an antitubercular agent with no schistosomicidal effect. Common misconceptions include confusing praziquantel with broad-spectrum antiparasitics like albendazole; however, albendazole\u2019s mechanism (inhibiting beta-tubulin polymerization) is ineffective against schistosomes.","conceptual_foundation":"Schistosomiasis is a trematode infection caused by Schistosoma species (mansoni, haematobium, japonicum) classified under ICD-11 B65.9. Neurological involvement occurs when eggs embolize to the spinal cord, provoking granulomatous inflammation. The disease is nosologically a helminthic CNS infection (neuro-infectious subspecialty). Differential diagnoses include neurosyphilis, transverse myelitis, and neurocysticercosis. Historically, schistosomiasis was first described in the 19th century by Theodor Bilharz; taxonomy evolved to distinguish species by snail intermediate hosts and geographic distribution.","pathophysiology":"Adult schistosomes reside in mesenteric or vesical venous plexuses and release eggs that migrate through tissues. When eggs enter spinal vessels, they elicit a Th2-mediated granulomatous response characterized by eosinophils, macrophages, and fibrosis. Eosinophil degranulation releases major basic protein, causing neural tissue damage. Chronic inflammation leads to demyelination and neuronal loss in the spinal cord, manifesting as lower limb weakness.","clinical_manifestation":"Spinal schistosomiasis typically presents subacutely over days to weeks with paraparesis, sphincter dysfunction, and sensory level. Peripheral eosinophilia (>10% of total leukocytes) is common. Lesion location varies by species: S. mansoni often affects thoracic cord; S. japonicum can involve cervical segments. Untreated cases progress to irreversible cord degeneration.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: CBC (eosinophilia), serology (ELISA sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95%). Stool/urine O&P may detect eggs (sensitivity ~70% single test, increases with multiple samples). MRI of spine shows T2 hyperintense signal with cord enlargement. Definitive diagnosis by tissue biopsy demonstrating eggs and granulomas. Pretest probability is high in endemic exposure.","management_principles":"Praziquantel 40 mg/kg in two divided doses over one day (AAN guidelines, Level A). Mechanism: augments calcium influx into parasite. Adverse effects include headache, dizziness, abdominal pain. No dose adjustment needed in renal impairment. Corticosteroids may be added to reduce inflammatory cord edema in acute myelopathy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat stool/urine microscopy at 6 and 12 weeks post-treatment to confirm parasitological cure. Monitor neurological status monthly until stabilization. MRI may be repeated at 3 months if deficits persist. Prevent reinfection by public health measures in endemic areas.","clinical_pearls":"1. Spinal schistosomiasis often presents with eosinophilia\u2014think helminthic myelopathy. 2. Praziquantel is trivalent pyrazinoisoquinoline, drug of choice for schistosoma. 3. Early corticosteroids reduce permanent spinal cord injury in acute phase. 4. MRI shows \"pancord\" T2 hyperintensity in heavy infection. 5.
