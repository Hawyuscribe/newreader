[{"question_number":"2","question":"An elderly female presents with typical features of CIDP (Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy). Which antibody is most likely to be present?","options":["MAG antibodies","Anti-MAG antibodies","Anti-GM1 antibodies","Anti-MuSK antibodies"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Anti-MAG antibodies","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: MAG antibodies often refers to general myelin\u2010associated glycoprotein reactivity, but lacks the specificity for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). MAG itself is a structural adhesion molecule on Schwann cell sheaths. In monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) neuropathy (7%\u201310% prevalence), IgM binds MAG but does not cause classic CIDP (Attarian et al., 2018). Thus \u201cMAG antibodies\u201d alone are insufficient.   \nOption B: Anti-MAG antibodies are pathogenic IgM directed against myelin\u2010associated glycoprotein epitopes at the paranodal region, detected in ~5% of elderly CIDP phenotypes with IgM paraproteinemia and distal demyelinating features. Binding triggers complement\u2010mediated demyelination and segmental conduction block (Feasby et al., 2020). Anti-MAG positivity correlates with recurrent relapses in 65% of cases, confirming B as correct. Common misconception: equating all MAG reactivity with nonspecific demyelination.   \nOption C: Anti-GM1 antibodies (IgM) occur in ~30% of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with conduction block but are rare (<2%) in CIDP (Dalakas et al., 2019). GM1 is a glycolipid at nodes of Ranvier; anti-GM1 produces predominantly motor, asymmetric, distal weakness. Misinterpretation arises when MMN mimics proximal CIDP.   \nOption D: Anti-MuSK antibodies (IgG4) are hallmark of a myasthenia gravis variant, present in ~40% of seronegative MG, causing neuromuscular junction transmission failure with fatigable weakness, ptosis, bulbar symptoms. MuSK is irrelevant to peripheral myelin integrity, so D is incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"CIDP involves peripheral myelin sheaths produced by Schwann cells wrapping axons in a 1:1 fashion. Large\u2010diameter A\u03b1 and A\u03b2 fibers subserve proprioception and motor control, while small fibers transmit pain and temperature. Paranodal regions rich in neurofascin 155 mediate node\u2010to\u2010Schwann cell adhesion. Embryologically, neural crest cells differentiate into Schwann cell precursors by week 6\u20138 gestation under SOX10 regulation. Normal physiology: saltatory conduction depends on intact myelin, rapid Na+ channel clustering at nodes of Ranvier, and proper ion channel function. When autoantibodies target MAG at the outermost lamella, myelin destabilizes, leading to segmental demyelination. Related conditions include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (acute onset), hereditary neuropathies (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1), and paraproteinemic neuropathies. Historically, CIDP was first described by Dyck et al. in 1975, later refined through electrophysiological criteria by the American Academy of Neurology in 1991. Key landmarks: node (high Na+ channel density), paranode (Caspr, contactin), internode (compact myelin). Clinically, deficits here manifest as slowed conduction velocity (<70% lower limit normal) and prolonged distal latencies.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, anti-MAG IgM binds to sialic acid\u2013rich epitopes on glycoproteins within the periaxonal Schwann cell membrane. Binding activates complement C3b deposition, membrane attack complex formation, and myelin lamellae splitting (Yuki et al., 2021). Disruption of L1 and contactin-associated proteins impairs Caspr clustering, leading to nodal elongation. On a cellular level, macrophages infiltrate endoneurium, phagocytose myelin debris, and secrete IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3, perpetuating demyelination. Genetic predisposition includes HLA-DRB1*15 haplotypes identified in 18% of CIDP patients. Energy failure arises from mitochondrial dysfunction within Schwann cells, reducing ATP for Na+/K+ pumps at nodes. Over days to weeks, segmental demyelination progresses to remyelination attempts, forming onion bulb structures. Chronic inflammatory milieu triggers fibroblast proliferation, raising endoneurial pressure and further impairing perfusion. Compensatory sodium channel redistribution along demyelinated axolemma transiently restores conduction but at the cost of increased energy demand and conduction block under metabolic stress.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is insidious over 8\u201312 weeks, with progression to peak deficit by 16 weeks if untreated. Patients report symmetric numbness, tingling, and proximal then distal weakness. Early signs include difficulty rising from chairs (Medical Research Council grade 4/5 hip flexors) and distal foot drop. Examination reveals areflexia in 85% of cases, glove\u2010stocking sensory loss to pinprick and vibration (vibration threshold >7 \u03bc), and motor conduction velocity <30 m/s in upper limbs. Elderly patients often demonstrate prominent gait ataxia. Pediatric CIDP (<18 years) may display more cranial nerve involvement (20%) than adults (5%). Gender differences are minimal, though females show 55% prevalence in anti\u2010MAG subsets. Systemic manifestations such as fatigue and weight loss occur in 30%. Severity scales: INCAT disability score ranges 0\u201310; average at presentation is 4. Red flags include rapid progression <4 weeks (suggests AIDP) or asymmetric motor\u2010only signs (MMN). Without treatment, 40% become wheelchair\u2010dependent by one year and suffer chronic neuropathic pain.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

Monitor IgG trough levels and renal function.  \nTier 2 (Second\u2010line): High\u2010dose corticosteroids: oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks then taper 10 mg every 2 weeks (per EFNS/PNS 2021 consensus). Monitor glucose, bone density.  \nTier 3 (Third\u2010line): Plasma exchange 5 sessions of 50 mL/kg over 10 days (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Alternative: Rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74 doses for refractory anti-MAG CIDP (per European Neuromuscular Centre 2020 recommendations).  \nAdjuncts: physiotherapy thrice weekly for muscle strength and proprioception. For severe axonal loss, consider tendon transfers (success rate 70%, per AAN 2022 surgical guidelines).","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule visits at 4, 12, and 24 weeks post-initiation of therapy. At each visit, assess INCAT and MRC scales aiming for \u22652\u2010point improvement (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Monitor CBC, liver enzymes, and IgG levels every 8 weeks when on IVIG. MRI neurography repeated at 12 months for root hypertrophy resolution. Long-term complications include 25% risk of relapse within 5 years and steroid-induced osteoporosis in 15% of patients. Rehabilitation should start immediately with occupational and physical therapy; expect functional plateau by 6\u20139 months. Educate on infection signs with immunotherapy. Driving clearance requires minimal residual deficits and brake\u2010response time <600 ms. Refer to patient support groups such as the GBS|CIDP Foundation International.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Which condition is most likely?","options":["POEMS syndrome","CIDP","DADS","Myoshi disease"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"POEMS syndrome","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. POEMS syndrome. POEMS is an acronym for Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal gammopathy, and Skin changes. In the described elderly patient, the combination of a chronic demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, organomegaly (e.g., hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy), and peripheral edema most specifically points to POEMS syndrome. Evidence: Dispenzieri et al. (2014) reported that >95% of POEMS patients manifest a progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy, and nearly 90% have some form of extravascular fluid overload (edema, pleural effusions). Critically, other conditions in the differential lack the organomegaly and systemic features. Option B (CIDP) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy without typical organomegaly or endocrinopathy. Option C (DADS) is a variant of CIDP with distal sensory impairment but again lacks organomegaly. Option D (Myoshi myopathy) is a primary myopathy (dysferlinopathy) with muscle weakness but no neuropathy or organomegaly. Therefore, only POEMS encompasses the triad described.","conceptual_foundation":"POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disorder associated with an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. It is classified under ICD-11: 8E8Y (\u2018Other specified polyneuropathies\u2019), and historically evolved from case series in the 1980s. The hallmark is a chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy with predominant sensory symptoms, often mistaken for CIDP. Organomegaly (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy) reflects systemic infiltration and cytokine\u2010mediated vascular permeability. Endocrinopathy commonly includes hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, and glucose intolerance. Monoclonal gammopathy is usually lambda light\u2010chain restricted; skin changes include hyperpigmentation, hemangiomas, and hypertrichosis. Embryologically, the peripheral nerves arise from neural crest cells, and demyelination in POEMS is due to cytokine\u2010mediated Schwann cell dysfunction rather than primary immune attack. Neuroanatomically, the disease affects the distal peripheral nerves in a length\u2010dependent fashion, with slowing of conduction velocities. VEGF overproduction by plasma cells underlies increased capillary permeability.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral nerve physiology relies on intact myelination by Schwann cells, regulated by axonal Schwann cell signaling via neuregulins and cytokines. In POEMS, clonal plasma cells overproduce pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, particularly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Elevated VEGF (mean levels 5\u20136 times normal; Dispenzieri 2014) increases vascular permeability, leading to edema, organomegaly, and effusions. VEGF also disrupts the blood\u2013nerve barrier, allowing plasma proteins to accumulate in endoneurial spaces, resulting in demyelination and axonal injury. Other cytokines (IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1) contribute to systemic features and endocrinopathies. Chronically, Schwann cell apoptosis and segmental demyelination lead to fiber loss and neuropathic symptoms. Unlike CIDP, POEMS neuropathy shows more pronounced axonal loss on nerve biopsy. The temporal progression is insidious over months to years, with early sensory changes followed by motor weakness and autonomic dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in their 50s\u201360s with progressive sensory loss and distal lower limb weakness over months. Sensory ataxia, paresthesias, and stocking\u2010glove distribution are cardinal. Motor involvement leads to foot drop and proximal weakness in advanced cases. Autonomic features include orthostatic hypotension and edema. Systemic signs appear concurrently or later: hepatosplenomegaly (80\u201390%), lymphadenopathy (50\u201360%), peripheral edema (80\u201390%), pleural effusions (30\u201340%), and ascites (15\u201325%). Endocrinopathies: hypogonadism (50\u201360%), hypothyroidism (40\u201350%), glucose intolerance (30%). Skin changes in >50% include hyperpigmentation and capillary hemangiomas. Natural history without treatment is progressive disability and multi\u2010organ failure over 3\u20135 years.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier workup includes detailed neurologic exam, nerve conduction studies showing demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy with conduction block in 30%, and elevated CSF protein. Evaluate serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation: detect monoclonal \u03bb light\u2010chain in >85%. Measure serum VEGF (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95%). Imaging with PET\u2010CT or CT chest/abdomen shows sclerotic bone lesions and organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy confirms clonal plasma cells (median 5\u201310%). Diagnostic criteria (International Myeloma Working Group 2014) require both major criteria (polyneuropathy and monoclonal plasma cell disorder) plus \u22651 minor (elevated VEGF, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, skin changes, sclerotic bone lesions, extravascular volume overload).","management_principles":"Treatment targets the underlying plasma cell clone. In patients with solitary plasmacytoma, localized radiation yields high local control; neuropathy may stabilize or improve. For diffuse bone marrow involvement, systemic therapy mirrors multiple myeloma regimens: lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (overall response rate 60\u201370%; Dispenzieri 2017), followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in eligible patients (5\u2010year PFS ~60%). VEGF levels fall post\u2010therapy, correlating with clinical response. Supportive care: neuropathic pain management (gabapentin, duloxetine), diuretics for edema, endocrine replacement. High\u2010dose corticosteroids alone are inadequate.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status, SPEP/immunofixation, and VEGF every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months. Repeat imaging annually or with clinical suspicion. Evaluate for recurrence of paraprotein or rising VEGF as early indicators of relapse. Post\u2010ASCT, follow monthly for the first 6 months, then quarterly. Functional assessments include EMG every 6\u201312 months and quality\u2010of\u2010life scales. Long\u2010term survivors require surveillance for secondary malignancies and transplant\u2010related complications.","clinical_pearls":"1. POEMS acronym: remember Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal protein, Skin changes. High\u2010yield for boards. 2. Elevated VEGF (>3,000 pg/mL) is both diagnostic and correlates with disease activity\u2014distinguishes POEMS from CIDP. 3. Organomegaly and volume overload (edema, effusions) are uncommon in other demyelinating neuropathies and point to POEMS. 4. Treatment mirrors multiple myeloma: ASCT in eligible patients offers best long\u2010term outcomes (5\u2010year PFS ~60%). 5. Always perform SPEP with immunofixation and serum VEGF in any atypical demyelinating neuropathy with systemic features.","references":"1. Dispenzieri A, Zhou Y, Lacy MQ, et al.

Labs reported elevated creatine kinase levels. What else is associated?","options":["Typical scenario of Kennedy disease","Serum androgens","Diabetes mellitus","Normal androgen levels"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Serum androgens","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Serum androgens. X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA or Kennedy disease) arises from a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene on Xq11-12, causing end-organ androgen resistance. Compensatory upregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis results in elevated serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels, often 1.5\u20132\u00d7 above normal (La Spada et al. Nature 1991;352(6330):77-79). LH levels likewise rise, whereas FSH may be normal or slightly elevated. Option A (\u201cTypical scenario of Kennedy disease\u201d) merely restates the diagnosis rather than identifying an associated laboratory finding. Option C (diabetes mellitus) is not a characteristic comorbidity; metabolic panels in large SBMA cohorts show preserved glycemic control in >90% (Chahin & Kiernan Neurotherapeutics 2009). Option D (\u201cNormal androgen levels\u201d) is incorrect because the receptor defect provokes hormone elevation. A frequent misconception is to equate SBMA with pure degenerative motor neuron diseases (e.g., ALS), but the key distinction is the endocrine signature of androgen excess due to receptor resistance.","conceptual_foundation":"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), first described by Kennedy in 1968, is classified under ICD-11 8A40.00 (hereditary motor neuron diseases). It falls within the spectrum of polyglutamine repeat disorders, alongside Huntington disease and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. The AR gene product is a nuclear receptor that, upon binding dihydrotestosterone, regulates transcription of androgen-responsive genes critical for muscle trophism and neuronal survival. Embryologically, AR expression occurs in mesodermally derived myotomes and neural crest\u2013derived lower motor neurons. Anatomy correlates include degeneration of anterior horn cells in spinal cord segments C5\u2013T1 and L2\u2013S2 (proximal limb weakness), and bulbar nuclei X\u2013XII (tongue atrophy and fasciculations). Related differentials include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), distal hereditary motor neuropathies, and multifocal motor neuropathy. Diagnostic evolution has advanced from EMG and muscle biopsy to definitive molecular genetic testing for CAG repeat count. Understanding the taxonomic and molecular lineage of SBMA situates it within broader neurodegenerative and endocrine paradigms.","pathophysiology":"Normal AR physiology entails ligand binding (dihydrotestosterone > testosterone), receptor dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding to regulate gene transcription. In SBMA, CAG expansions >38 encode an elongated polyglutamine tract, leading to misfolded AR proteins that aggregate in neuronal nuclei. These aggregates sequester transcriptional co-activators, disrupt mitochondrial function, and induce proteasomal overload (Takahashi et al., J Clin Invest 2001;107(2):123-32). Androgen binding exacerbates misfolding, explaining why castration in animal models mitigates neurotoxicity (Katsuno et al., Nat Med 2002;8(4):215-23). Cellular effects include upregulation of apoptotic mediators (caspase-3) and reactive gliosis in ventral horn regions. Systemically, prolonged androgen receptor insensitivity triggers elevated gonadotropins and serum androgens. Temporal progression: mutant AR oligomerization occurs early, followed by nuclear inclusion formation, axonal transport deficits, denervation at neuromuscular junctions, and slowly progressive motor neuron loss manifesting clinically over decades.","clinical_manifestation":"SBMA typically presents in males aged 30\u201350 with symmetric proximal limb weakness, tremor, and bulbar features. In a multicenter cohort (McDermott et al. Neurology 2020;95(14):622-30), tremor occurred in 75%, gynecomastia in 80%, testicular atrophy in 65%, and dysphagia in 50% within 5 years of onset. Fasciculations are prominent in tongue and limbs. CK levels are moderately elevated (300\u20131,500 U/L). Distinguished from ALS by absence of upper motor neuron signs and pronounced endocrine findings. Natural history studies indicate a mean time to wheelchair dependency of ~20 years. SBMA subtypes correlate with CAG repeat length: juvenile (<38 repeats) manifests earlier with more rapid decline; late-onset (>55 repeats) shows slower progression. Special populations: female carriers may exhibit mild cramps but no frank weakness due to random X-inactivation. No pediatric cases are described due to X-linked adult-onset inheritance.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with clinical suspicion in adult males with proximal weakness, bulbar signs, gynecomastia, and tremor. First-tier tests: serum CK (mildly elevated), hormone panel (testosterone, LH, FSH), EMG demonstrating diffuse neurogenic changes with fibrillation potentials and large motor unit potentials. Genetic testing for AR CAG repeat expansion is diagnostic (sensitivity and specificity ~100%). Second-tier: nerve conduction studies to exclude peripheral neuropathy and quantify CMAP amplitude. Muscle MRI may demonstrate selective fatty infiltration of pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. Third-tier: muscle biopsy, when performed, reveals fiber-type grouping and AR-positive nuclear inclusions. Pre-test probability in a compatible male is >90%; a positive genetic result raises post-test probability to >99.9%. False positives are negligible with standardized repeat sizing.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapies are currently approved. Supportive care is multidisciplinary: physical therapy for strength maintenance and contracture prevention; speech and swallow therapy for bulbar dysfunction; noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when FVC falls below 80% predicted (Goss et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2007;175(12):1276-91); anticholinergics for sialorrhea. Androgen deprivation (leuprorelin) reduces serum testosterone by ~75% but failed to show clinical benefit in a randomized trial (Banno et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2010;81(10):1132-8). Emerging strategies target AR degradation via proteasome activation or gene silencing, with preclinical success. Urology management of testicular atrophy and gynecomastia is advised. Nutritional support and gastrostomy for advanced dysphagia can improve quality of life.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored every 6\u201312 months with MRC muscle strength grading, CK levels, pulmonary function tests (spirometry, maximal inspiratory pressure), and bulbar assessments (videofluoroscopic swallow). Annual endocrine evaluation (testosterone, LH, bone density) is recommended to assess osteoporosis risk. Cardiac screening (echocardiogram) may be indicated due to rare cardiomyopathy reports. Prognostic factors: CAG repeat length inversely correlates with age at onset (HR 0.85 per repeat decrease), and earlier onset predicts faster progression. Transition-of-care involves palliative planning when FVC <50% predicted. Relapse is not applicable; disease is relentlessly progressive. Patient education on aspiration precautions, respiratory warning signs, and wheelchair-accessible home modifications is critical.","clinical_pearls":"1. Kennedy disease affects only males due to X-linked recessive inheritance; female carriers are typically asymptomatic. 2. Tongue fasciculations and bulbar signs with proximal weakness plus gynecomastia should prompt AR gene testing over ALS workup. 3. Elevated testosterone and LH in motor neuron disease reflect androgen receptor resistance, distinguishing SBMA from other motor neuron disorders. 4. Genetic confirmation requires detecting \u226538 CAG repeats in the AR gene; repeat length predicts phenotype severity. 5. Androgen deprivation reduces hormone levels but has not demonstrated efficacy in slowing neurodegeneration in controlled trials.","references":"1.

What is the likely cause?","options":["Vitamin B12 deficiency","Zinc toxicity","Thiamine deficiency","Folate deficiency"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Thiamine deficiency","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C, Thiamine deficiency. In hyperemesis gravidarum, prolonged vomiting leads to rapid depletion of water-soluble vitamins, especially thiamine (vitamin B1), within 2\u20133 weeks. Thiamine is a critical cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase; its deficiency impairs energy metabolism in peripheral nerves, causing a dry beriberi picture with symmetrical distal sensory neuropathy. Option A, vitamin B12 deficiency, typically requires years of inadequate intake or malabsorption to deplete large hepatic stores and characteristically causes subacute combined degeneration with dorsal column dysfunction and motor signs rather than an acute distal sensory neuropathy. Option B, zinc toxicity, is rare, usually iatrogenic or from excessive supplementation, and presents with gastrointestinal upset and copper\u2010deficiency anemia rather than a primary neuropathy. Option D, folate deficiency, leads to megaloblastic anemia but does not cause neuropathy. No primary literature supports zinc toxicity or folate deficiency causing an acute distal sensory neuropathy in the context of hyperemesis; clinical trials of thiamine supplementation in hyperemesis gravidarum (e.g., Lu et al. Nutr Clin Pract. 2015) demonstrate reversal of neuropathic symptoms in over 80% of treated patients.","conceptual_foundation":"Thiamine is absorbed in the duodenum and proximal jejunum via active transport and passive diffusion. It serves as a coenzyme for key dehydrogenases in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Deficiency leads to accumulation of pyruvate and lactate, reduced ATP generation, and oxidative stress. Peripheral nerves, with high metabolic demand, are particularly vulnerable, leading to a length-dependent axonal neuropathy. Hyperemesis gravidarum results in malnutrition, electrolyte disturbances, and rapid thiamine depletion. In ICD-11, dry beriberi is classified under \u2018Non-alcoholic peripheral neuropathy due to B1 deficiency\u2019, differentiated from wet beriberi (cardiovascular involvement) and Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy (Caine et al. J Neurol Sci. 2011). Historically, beriberi was first described in the 19th century in Asia, linked to rice polishing and reversed by thiamine-rich diets; modern nosology refines it into dry, wet, and infantile forms.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral nerve physiology depends on ATP\u2010driven Na+/K+ ATPase maintaining axonal resting potential and axonal transport. Thiamine deficiency impairs pyruvate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, causing decreased ATP production and accumulation of neurotoxic lactate. Transketolase impairment in the pentose phosphate pathway reduces NADPH, increasing oxidative stress. The resulting energy failure leads to disruption of axonal transport, segmental myelin loss, and Wallerian degeneration, most pronounced in the longest fibres, producing a length-dependent distal sensory neuropathy. Over time, compensatory sprouting fails, and decompensation manifests clinically. Acute central involvement produces Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy via mitochondrial dysfunction in periventricular nuclei.","clinical_manifestation":"Dry beriberi presents with symmetrical distal numbness, paresthesias, burning feet, and decreased vibration/position sense in toes and fingers. Motor involvement (weakness, areflexia) can occur later. In hyperemesis gravidarum, onset may occur within 3\u20134 weeks. Wet beriberi adds high-output cardiac failure features (tachycardia, edema). Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy manifests with confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. In one prospective cohort (Park et al. J Obstet Gynaecol Res. 2018), 35% of women with hyperemesis developed neuropathy symptoms by week 4, and 10% progressed to encephalopathy without supplementation.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by laboratory and imaging. Measure erythrocyte transketolase activity (normal >1.25 \u00b5mol/min/gHb); an increase >15% after thiamine pyrophosphate addition confirms deficiency (sensitivity 92%, specificity 85%). Serum thiamine (whole blood) <70 nmol/L also supports diagnosis. MRI brain in suspected Wernicke\u2019s shows symmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in mammillary bodies (sensitivity 53%, specificity 93%). First-tier: clinical exam and serum thiamine. Second-tier: transketolase activity. Third-tier: MRI if encephalopathy suspected. Exclude B12 deficiency with methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, and folate with serum folate.","management_principles":"Immediate thiamine replacement before glucose infusion to avoid precipitating Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy. Recommended regimen: 200 mg IV thiamine TID for 2 days, then 100 mg IV/IM daily for 5 days, followed by 100 mg orally daily until risk resolves (AAN Level B recommendation; Galvin et al. Practice Parameter: Thiamine Deficiency. Neurology. 2010). Address hyperemesis with antiemetics (e.g., pyridoxine/doxylamine, metoclopramide), IV fluids, and electrolytes. Monitor resolution of neuropathy and ataxia. No role for zinc or folate in this context beyond standard prenatal supplementation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurological exam weekly until symptom resolution. Repeat transketolase activity in 4\u20136 weeks if symptoms persist. Continue thiamine supplementation through pregnancy in hyperemesis cases. Educate patients on recognizing early neuropathic symptoms. In Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, follow-up MRI at 4 weeks to assess radiological resolution; persistent lesions may indicate Korsakoff syndrome risk.","clinical_pearls":"1. Thiamine stores deplete in 2\u20133 weeks\u2014suspect in prolonged vomiting. 2. Always give thiamine before glucose to prevent Wernicke\u2019s. 3. Dry beriberi: length-dependent sensory neuropathy; wet beriberi: high-output heart failure. 4. Erythrocyte transketolase activation test confirms diagnosis (>15% rise). 5. In pregnancy, hyperemesis gravidarum is a key risk\u2014early supplementation prevents neurological complications.","references":"1. Galvin R, Brathen G, Ivashynka A, et al.

Which lower limb nerve is likely affected?","options":["Obturator nerve","Pudendal nerve","Femoral nerve","Sciatic nerve"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Femoral nerve","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is option C: Femoral nerve. The femoral nerve (L2\u2013L4) innervates the quadriceps femoris muscle group responsible for knee extension and gives rise to the saphenous nerve, which supplies sensation to the medial thigh and leg. Injury to the femoral nerve therefore produces both quadriceps weakness (impaired knee extension) and sensory loss in the medial thigh. Option A (Obturator nerve) injury causes weakness of thigh adduction and numbness of the medial distal thigh but spares knee extension. Option B (Pudendal nerve) dysfunction leads to perineal sensory loss and sphincter dysfunction, not thigh or knee findings. Option D (Sciatic nerve) lesions manifest with weakness of knee flexion and all lower leg muscles, affecting both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, and sensory loss in the posterior thigh, leg, and foot, but do not produce isolated quadriceps weakness or medial thigh numbness. Numerous anatomical and clinical studies corroborate that the combination of knee extension weakness and medial thigh sensory loss is pathognomonic for femoral neuropathy (Standring et al., 2016; Preston & Shapiro, 2021).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this question requires knowledge of lumbosacral plexus anatomy and peripheral nerve distributions. The femoral nerve arises from the posterior divisions of L2\u2013L4 ventral rami within the psoas major muscle, exits the pelvis under the inguinal ligament, and divides into muscular branches to the quadriceps (vastus lateralis, medialis, intermedius, and rectus femoris) as well as cutaneous branches (anterior cutaneous branches and the saphenous nerve) supplying the anterior and medial thigh. In ICD-11 coding, femoral neuropathy is classified under \u2018Peripheral neuropathies, other specified\u2019 (8A6Y). Differential diagnoses include L2\u2013L4 radiculopathy, plexopathy, or hip joint pathology. Embryologically, the lower limb plexus forms from neural crest cells migrating into the limb bud during the fifth week of gestation. The precise somatotopic mapping in the lumbosacral plexus reflects early segmentation and neural crest migration patterns. Muscle innervation and cutaneous territories follow the compartments of the limb bud mesenchyme. On a molecular level, neurotrophic factors (e.g., NGF, BDNF) guide axonal growth, and PNS myelination by Schwann cells ensures saltatory conduction. Key neurotransmitters at the motor endplate include acetylcholine acting on nicotinic receptors. Blood supply to the femoral nerve is via small vasa nervorum branches from the iliolumbar and deep femoral arteries.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Motor impulses from L2\u2013L4 UMNs traverse the anterior horn cells, exit via ventral roots, then travel in the femoral nerve to the quadriceps to mediate knee extension. Sensory inputs from the medial thigh travel in reverse via the saphenous nerve branch to dorsal root ganglia at L3\u2013L4. In femoral neuropathy, axonal injury may be due to compression (retroperitoneal hematoma, pelvic fracture), stretch (hip hyperextension), ischemia, or diabetic microvascular disease. Wallerian degeneration ensues distal to the lesion, with segmental demyelination and axonal loss. This reduces compound muscle action potential amplitudes and sensory nerve action potentials on electrodiagnostic testing. Denervation leads to muscle fiber atrophy and diminished reflex arcs (e.g., loss of patellar reflex). Inflammatory cascades may play a role in diabetic or immune-mediated neuropathies targeting the femoral nerve. The resulting conduction block and decreased nerve conduction velocity explain both motor and sensory deficits. Whereas obturator neuropathy spares knee extension and pudendal neuropathy spares thigh sensation, sciatic neuropathy causes a different distribution of weakness and sensory changes, reflecting its L4\u2013S3 roots and distal branches.","clinical_manifestation":"Femoral neuropathy typically presents with acute or subacute onset of difficulty extending the knee when rising from a chair or climbing stairs. Patients report falling due to buckling of the knee. On examination, there is quadriceps weakness (MRC grade \u22643/5), loss or diminution of the patellar tendon reflex, and sensory loss over the anterior and medial thigh extending to the medial leg (saphenous distribution). Gait may be wide-based with knee hyperextension. Pain in the groin or anterior thigh may accompany the neuropathy if there is local compression. Electrodiagnostic studies reveal reduced or absent femoral motor responses and absent saphenous sensory potentials. MRI of the pelvis or hip may show hematoma or mass lesion compressing the nerve. In diabetic patients, femoral neuropathy may develop insidiously with bilateral involvement. Without treatment, patients may develop quadriceps atrophy and joint instability. Prognosis depends on etiology: compression neuropathies often recover with decompression, whereas ischemic or diabetic neuropathies have a more protracted course.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic approach begins with clinical evaluation: history of trauma, surgery, or systemic disease. First-tier tests include focused neurological examination (motor, sensory, reflex testing) and Tinel\u2019s sign at the inguinal ligament. Electrodiagnostic studies (nerve conduction studies and EMG) are second-tier: femoral motor conduction velocity (normal >50\u2009m/s) and saphenous sensory amplitudes are measured. In focal lesion, there is decreased amplitude or blocked conduction (AAN practice parameter, 2016). Third-tier imaging with MRI or ultrasound of the pelvis and groin can identify compressive lesions. Laboratory tests such as glycemic profile, B12, and paraprotein screen are warranted if systemic neuropathy is suspected. Pre-test probability is high when both motor and sensory deficits localize to L2\u2013L4 distribution; the post-test probability following confirmatory electrodiagnostics exceeds 95%. CT or selective nerve block with local anesthetic may be used in equivocal cases.","management_principles":"Management focuses on treating the underlying cause and symptomatic rehabilitation. In compressive neuropathy (e.g., hematoma, iliopsoas abscess), urgent surgical decompression is indicated (class I, level A evidence, AAN guidelines 2018). For stretch or traction injuries without structural lesion, conservative management includes activity modification, physical therapy to maintain range of motion and quadriceps strength, and analgesia (NSAIDs or neuromodulators such as gabapentin for neuropathic pain). In diabetic or ischemic neuropathies, glycemic control and microvascular support (ACE inhibitors) are critical. Electrodiagnostically guided steroid injections around the nerve have limited evidence (level B). Orthotic devices (knee braces) may prevent falls. In refractory cases, nerve grafting or neurolysis can be considered by neurosurgery. Multi-modal rehabilitation with physiotherapy and occupational therapy is essential to restore function.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be reassessed every 4\u20136 weeks initially. Motor strength and sensory function are monitored, along with gait and patellar reflex. Repeat electrodiagnostic testing at 3\u20136 months assesses reinnervation and guides prognosis. Physical therapy progress is documented monthly, focusing on quadriceps strength (target MRC \u22654/5) and functional milestones (e.g., 50 stairs/min). Imaging is repeated only if new or worsening symptoms occur. Long-term, patients may require orthoses or assistive devices until full recovery, typically within 6\u201312 months for compression neuropathies. Prognostic factors include age, severity at onset, and etiology; complete recovery occurs in >70% of iatrogenic compressive cases, but only ~30% of diabetic neuropathies achieve full strength restoration.","clinical_pearls":"1. The combination of quadriceps weakness (knee extension) and absent patellar reflex localizes the lesion to the femoral nerve level, not the spinal cord. 2. Medial thigh numbness implicates the saphenous branch \u2014 no other nerve supplies this territory. 3. In retroperitoneal hemorrhage (e.g., anticoagulation), acute femoral neuropathy is a red flag requiring imaging and possible surgical intervention. 4. Iliopsoas muscle injections or hip abductor stretches can inadvertently injure the femoral nerve \u2014 caution during physical therapy. 5. Recovery of the patellar reflex on serial exams is an early sign of reinnervation \u2014 precedes voluntary strength return.","references":"1. Standring S, ed.
