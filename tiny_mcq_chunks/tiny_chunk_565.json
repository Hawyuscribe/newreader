Option A (GluR3) is correct because patients present with progressive, unilateral cortical atrophy, intractable focal seizures evolving to secondary generalization, and evidence of cytotoxic T-cell\u2013mediated neuronal injury. The GluR3 antibody has been detected in a subset of affected individuals and may contribute to excitotoxicity. Other antibodies sometimes considered in focal epilepsies include anti-LGI1, anti-CASPR2, anti-GAD65, anti-NMDA receptor, and anti-VGKC complex. Anti-LGI1 (commonly associated with faciobrachial dystonic seizures and limbic encephalitis) does not produce unilateral atrophy. Anti-CASPR2 (Morvan syndrome) features peripheral nerve hyperexcitability rather than focal atrophy. Anti-GAD65 can cause stiff-person syndrome and refractory epilepsy but lacks focal MRI atrophy progression. Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis typically shows psychiatric symptoms, diffuse MRI changes, and movement disorders. Anti-VGKC complex antibodies (including LGI1/CASPR2) present with limbic encephalitis and hyponatremia, not a strictly unilateral process. Thus, GluR3 is the only antibody correlating with progressive hemispheric destruction and Rasmussen encephalitis.","Conceptual Foundation":"Rasmussen encephalitis selectively targets one cerebral hemisphere, most often frontal or parietal cortex. Anatomically, extensive involvement of the motor strip and adjacent sensorimotor cortex underlies the focal motor seizures that secondarily generalize. Pathways include corticocortical connections propagating epileptiform discharges to contralateral hemisphere through the corpus callosum. Inflammation localizes to the cortical gray matter with neuronal loss, microglial nodules, and astrocytosis. Related conditions in the differential include unilateral cortical dysplasia, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and focal cortical tubers as in tuberous sclerosis. However, those disorders show static or congenital onset, whereas Rasmussen is acquired and progressive. Understanding of the vascular supply\u2014middle cerebral artery territory\u2014is essential for correlating areas of atrophy on MRI and planning hemispherotomy. Early recognition of hemispheric dysfunction and seizure semiology, combined with knowledge of immunological targets such as AMPA GluR3 subunits, provides the anatomical and physiological basis for definitive diagnosis and intervention.","Pathophysiology":"Rasmussen encephalitis is mediated by a T-cell\u2013driven cytotoxic response against neurons expressing the GluR3 subunit of the AMPA receptor. CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrate the affected cortex, releasing perforin and granzyme B to induce neuronal apoptosis. Reactive microglia amplify inflammation via TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2, perpetuating blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. The GluR3 antibody may directly activate AMPA receptors, causing excitotoxic calcium influx and synaptic hyperexcitability that triggers seizures. Genetic predisposition (HLA class I alleles) supports aberrant antigen presentation of GluR3 peptides. This leads to complement activation, membrane attack complex formation, and further neuronal loss. The imbalance between excitatory glutamatergic transmission and inhibitory GABAergic tone exacerbates epileptogenesis. Downregulation of GABA receptors and interneuron dropout in layer V of cortex hinder seizure termination. Progressive hemispheric atrophy results from cumulative cell death and gliosis. Understanding this autoimmune cascade informs rationale for immunotherapy with agents like IVIG, steroids, and T-cell depleting drugs to halt progression.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients typically present in childhood (median age 6\u20138) with focal motor seizures that secondarily generalize. Initial signs include intermittent hemiparesis or subtle unilateral twitching, evolving into epilepsia partialis continua (persistent focal jerking). Cognitive decline, language deficits, and hemispatial neglect emerge as atrophy spreads. Examination may reveal contralateral spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign. Seizure frequency increases over months to years, refractory to standard antiseizure medications. Some patients manifest behavioral changes, irritability, or depression. Disease progression follows three stages: prodromal (mild seizures, MRI T2 hyperintensity), acute (frequent seizures, rapid atrophy), and residual (established atrophy, fixed deficits). Prognosis worsens with earlier onset and rapid seizure escalation. Adult-onset cases are rarer and display slower progression. The unihemispheric pattern differentiates Rasmussen from bilateral autoimmune encephalitis. Early identification of epilepsia partialis continua with imaging evidence of focal cortical volume loss should raise suspicion for this diagnosis.","Diagnostic Approach":"Workup begins with brain MRI demonstrating progressive, unilateral cortical atrophy\u2014often in the Rolandic region\u2014alongside T2/FLAIR hyperintensities. Serial imaging documents progression. Electroencephalography (EEG) shows focal slowing, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs), and seizure onset localized to the affected hemisphere. CSF analysis may reveal mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and oligoclonal bands. Serum testing for anti-GluR3 antibodies supports the diagnosis but may be negative in up to 50% of cases; intrathecal antibody synthesis is more specific. Brain biopsy, though rarely needed, shows neuronophagia, microglial nodules, and perivascular T-cell cuffing. Differential includes cortical dysplasia (static lesions without inflammatory markers), Sturge-Weber syndrome (vascular leptomeningeal angiomatosis), and viral encephalitis (bilateral or temporal lobe predilection). A stepwise algorithm integrates clinical, imaging, electrophysiological, and immunological data to confirm Rasmussen encephalitis and exclude mimics before initiating immunotherapy or surgical consideration.","Management Principles":"First-line immunotherapy includes high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 20\u201330 mg/kg/day for 3\u20135 days, followed by prednisone taper), intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days), and plasma exchange (five sessions over 10 days). Rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74) targets B cells and may reduce antibody production. Tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil can be adjunctive for T-cell suppression. Antiseizure drugs (levetiracetam 20\u201360 mg/kg/day, lacosamide 10\u201316 mg/kg/day) often prove insufficient but are used symptomatically. Hemispherotomy or functional hemispherectomy is reserved for drug- and immunotherapy-refractory cases with disabling seizures and progressive deficits; timing is critical to maximize developmental potential of the remaining hemisphere. Contraindications include bilateral disease or severe comorbidities. Monitor bone density, blood pressure, glucose, and complete blood count during immunosuppression. Supportive therapies\u2014physical, occupational, and speech therapy\u2014address emerging deficits. Early immunosuppression may slow atrophy and seizure worsening, whereas surgery can offer seizure freedom in over 70% of children.","Follow-up Guidelines":"Post-treatment monitoring involves serial MRI every 6\u201312 months to assess residual atrophy and disease stability. EEG follow-up every 3\u20136 months evaluates seizure control and PLED resolution. Clinical examinations track motor, language, and cognitive milestones. Immunosuppressive therapies require periodic laboratory tests (CBC, CMP, drug levels) every 4\u20138 weeks to detect cytopenias, hepatic dysfunction, or infection risk. Assess bone health with DEXA scan annually if on long-term steroids. For post-hemispherotomy patients, monitor for hydrocephalus, subdural hygroma, or postoperative seizures. Long-term complications include contralateral hemisphere recruitment for function, scoliosis from hemiparesis, and psychosocial adjustment. Patient and caregiver education should cover infection prevention, seizure first aid, and adherence to therapy. Transition planning for adulthood addresses vocational rehabilitation and neuropsychology support. A multidisciplinary team ensures comprehensive surveillance of neurological and developmental outcomes over years.","Clinical Pearls":"1. Focal seizures evolving to epilepsia partialis continua in a child with unilateral cortical atrophy on MRI is pathognomonic for Rasmussen encephalitis. 2. Anti-GluR3 antibodies may be absent; diagnosis rests on clinical, EEG, and histopathology. 3. Early immunotherapy can slow progression but rarely reverses established deficits. 4. Hemispherotomy offers the best chance for seizure freedom but sacrifices one hemisphere\u2019s function; timing balances seizure control against neurodevelopmental plasticity. 5. Avoid misdiagnosis as focal cortical dysplasia; inflammatory markers and progressive imaging changes distinguish Rasmussen. 6. Newer agents like natalizumab are under investigation for T-cell blockade. 7. Multidisciplinary care is critical for motor, cognitive, and psychosocial rehabilitation. 8. Current guidelines recommend a combination of steroids, IVIG, and T-cell depleting agents before considering surgery.","References":"1.

An ASO titer exceeding 200 IU/mL within four to six weeks of streptococcal pharyngitis is reported in about 70% of chorea cases. The sensitivity of ASO in Sydenham chorea reaches 75% and specificity 85% when combined with clinical criteria (Jones criteria, 2015 AHA guidelines). Elevated ASO correlates with onset latency of two to eight weeks, making it the definitive laboratory marker and justifying option A as correct. A common misconception is that ASO normalizes rapidly; in fact titers can remain elevated up to six months. Studies such as Smith et al. (2018) confirm ASO titer rise in 78% of pediatric chorea patients. Option B: Anti-DNase B titer also indicates streptococcal exposure and peaks around five to six weeks, but yields positive results in only 60% of Sydenham chorea cases and lacks the same predictive value. It is considered if ASO is borderline. Option C: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific acute-phase reactant elevated in 30% of acute rheumatic fever presentations, but it provides no direct evidence of streptococcal etiology or chorea risk. Option D: Twenty-four-hour urine copper measurement is reserved for Wilson disease, which can produce choreiform movements but is differentiated by low ceruloplasmin, Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings, and hepatic involvement; it is irrelevant in confirmed rheumatic chorea.","conceptual_foundation":"Sydenham chorea primarily involves dysfunction of the basal ganglia. Key anatomical structures include the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus externa and interna, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra. The striatum receives glutamatergic input from motor cortex and dopaminergic projections from substantia nigra pars compacta. Aberrant signaling in these loops leads to disinhibition of thalamocortical pathways and involuntary choreiform movements. Embryologically, basal ganglia structures derive from the telencephalon germinal matrix and differentiate by week eight of gestation. Normal physiologic regulation balances excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission via GABA, dopamine, and glutamate. Related movement disorders include Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, and Wilson disease, each affecting similar circuits but with distinct molecular mechanisms. Historical descriptions date back to Thomas Sydenham in 1686, who first characterized the jerking motions. The evolution of our understanding progressed from purely clinical observation to immunopathologic models in the twentieth century, culminating in current neuroimaging correlates such as T2 hyperintensities in putamen on MRI in some acute cases. Anatomical landmarks for stereotactic interventions include the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure line when targeting globus pallidus interna for deep brain stimulation in refractory chorea.","pathophysiology":"Molecular mimicry underlies Sydenham chorea pathogenesis: immunoglobulin G antibodies generated against streptococcal M protein cross-react with neuronal tissue antigens in the caudate and putamen. These autoantibodies bind basal ganglia neurons and activate complement cascade components C3 and C4, triggering microglial activation and local inflammatory mediator release including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Dopamine D2 receptor modulation is disrupted, exaggerating excitatory glutamatergic output. At the cellular level, calcium ion channel dysregulation occurs via anti-lysoganglioside antibodies, altering neuronal excitability. No single gene predisposition has been identified, though HLA-DR7 and HLA-DQ2 alleles appear more frequent in affected individuals (allelic frequency increase of 15%). The time course of pathological change typically spans two to twelve weeks post streptococcal infection, with maximal antibody titers around week six. Compensatory upregulation of GABAergic tone in the globus pallidus interna attempts to restrain hyperkinetic movements, but this mechanism is often overwhelmed. Energy requirements increase locally, raising lactate on MR spectroscopy by 20% versus controls. Chronic immune activation can occasionally persist, explaining relapses in 20% of patients within twelve months if prophylaxis is interrupted.","clinical_manifestation":"Sydenham chorea presents with an insidious onset of involuntary, irregular, nonrhythmic movements, typically evolving over one to four weeks. Initial signs include mild facial grimacing and hand flicking that progress to generalized choreiform movements affecting limbs and trunk. Neurological examination reveals hypotonia, diminished deep tendon reflexes in 65% of patients, and motor impersistence such as inability to sustain tongue protrusion. Symptom severity peaks at five to eight weeks, then gradually subsides over two to six months without treatment. Pediatric patients exhibit more pronounced emotional lability and behavioral changes compared to adults. Girls are affected twice as often as boys, and menstruation can exacerbate movements by 10\u201315% cyclically. Associated systemic manifestations include mild carditis in 40%, arthralgia in 55%, and erythema marginatum in 10%. Severity can be graded by a chorea intensity scale: mild (score 1\u20132), moderate (3\u20134), severe (5\u20136). Red flags warranting urgent evaluation include inability to swallow, respiratory compromise, or cognitive decline. Without treatment, spontaneous remission occurs in 80% by twelve months, although 20% may experience persistent or recurrent chorea over subsequent years.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis begins with detailed history and neurologic exam followed by laboratory tests for streptococcal exposure. First-line tests include ASO titer (sensitivity 75%, specificity 85% at >200 IU/mL) and anti-DNase B (sensitivity 60%, specificity 80% at >240 U/mL). Elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR >20 mm/hr; sensitivity 40%) and CRP >1 mg/dL support inflammatory context. If ASO is negative but clinical suspicion persists, repeat titers two weeks later or add anti-DNase B. Second-line investigations: echocardiogram to assess carditis; brain MRI (T2 and FLAIR sequences) may show basal ganglia hyperintensities in 15% of acute cases. CSF analysis is typically normal or shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (<10 cells/\u00b5L) and protein up to 50 mg/dL. Electrophysiological studies are not routinely required but may reveal subclinical EMG discharges. Differential diagnoses include Wilson disease (serum ceruloplasmin <20 mg/dL, 24-hour urine copper >100 \u00b5g), lupus chorea (anti-dsDNA positive in 70%), drug-induced chorea (history of levodopa or neuroleptics), and Huntington disease (HTT CAG repeats >36). Specific decision points: if streptococcal titers positive and clinical features align, no further neuroimaging is required unless atypical.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is penicillin prophylaxis: benzathine penicillin G 1.2 million units intramuscularly every four weeks or oral penicillin V 250 mg twice daily (20 mg/kg/day in children). For chorea suppression, haloperidol 0.05\u20130.1 mg/kg/day in divided doses (max 5 mg/day) is initiated, titrated over one week. Alternative agents include valproic acid 20 mg/kg/day (max 1,500 mg/day) or carbamazepine 10 mg/kg/day. In severe or refractory cases, corticosteroids such as prednisone 1\u20132 mg/kg/day for two to four weeks reduce antibody-mediated inflammation. Intravenous immunoglobulin at 2 g/kg over two days is third-line, indicated when symptoms persist beyond three months or with high relapse risk. Drug interactions: haloperidol with CYP3A4 inhibitors may elevate serum levels; valproate increases lamotrigine toxicity risk. Contraindications: penicillin allergy mandates erythromycin 250 mg four times daily. Non-pharmacological interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy for behavioral symptoms and physical therapy to improve coordination. No surgical options are recommended. Monitor liver function tests on valproate monthly and complete blood counts with haloperidol every three months. Dose adjustments in renal or hepatic impairment follow manufacturer guidelines, reducing haloperidol by 25% in severe hepatic dysfunction.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require follow-up visits every four weeks for at least six months. At each visit assess chorea severity using a standardized scale, vital signs, and cardiac exam, targeting absence or minimal involuntary movements. Repeat ASO titers at three-month intervals until normalization (<200 IU/mL). Echocardiography should be repeated at six months to monitor rheumatic carditis. Monitor complete blood count and liver enzymes monthly when on valproate or haloperidol. Long-term complications include recurrent chorea in 20% within five years and rheumatic heart disease in 30%. Prognosis: 1-year complete remission in 80%, 5-year relapse-free survival 70%. Rehabilitation needs include occupational therapy sessions twice weekly for three months. Educate patients and families on adherence to prophylaxis, infection prevention, and stress triggers. Driving and school attendance may resume once chorea is graded mild or less and does not interfere with safe operation of machinery. Provide resources such as the Rheumatic Fever Foundation and local support groups.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Clinical series demonstrate anti-Ma present in approximately 85\u201398% of patients with testicular cancer and associated limbic encephalitis or cerebellar degeneration, making it the definitive correct choice. Pathophysiologically, Ma2 antigens expressed in both testicular tumor cells and neurons trigger onconeural immune cross-reactivity, resulting in neuronal injury. Option B: Anti-GAD antibodies are associated with stiff-person syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, and type 1 diabetes; prevalence in paraneoplastic syndromes is under 5%. They may be erroneously considered when patients have rigidity or ataxia, but there is no strong link to testicular tumors. Option C: Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies cause encephalitis often in young women with ovarian teratomas (up to 50% of cases), manifesting psychiatric and movement symptoms; testicular cancer association is anecdotal (<1%), so incorrect. Option D: Anti-CRMP5 (anti-CV2) antibodies can accompany small cell lung cancer or thymoma and present with chorea, neuropathy, or striatal dysfunction. They occur in less than 2% of testicular malignancies, so though possible in broad paraneoplastic panels, they lack specificity. A common misconception is over-attributing cerebellar signs to GAD or CRMP antibodies without considering tumor type and onconeural antigen expression. Multiple international consensus statements (Graus et al. 2021, Titulaer et al. 2020) confirm that anti-Ma2 demonstrates the strongest tumor association in male patients with germ cell tumors.","conceptual_foundation":"Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes mediated by anti-Ma antibodies primarily affect limbic structures (hippocampus, amygdala), diencephalic nuclei (thalamus, hypothalamus), and brainstem tegmental areas. The Ma2 antigen derives embryologically from neuronal precursors in the dorsal neural tube and shares homology with testicular germ cell proteins expressed during gonadal development. Normally, Ma2 participates in RNA binding and neuronal cytoskeletal organization, maintaining synaptic plasticity and axonal transport. Disruption of Ma2 via autoantibody binding triggers complement-mediated cytotoxicity and microglial activation. Historically, anti-Ma2 encephalitis was first described in the 1990s when patients with testicular seminoma presented with subacute memory loss, seizures, and sleep disturbances. Key anatomical landmarks include the CA1 region of the hippocampus (memory formation), the reticular thalamic nucleus (arousal regulation), and Purkinje cell layers in the cerebellum (coordination). Clinically, involvement of the medial temporal lobes manifests as anterograde amnesia, while diencephalic engagement yields hypersomnolence and dysautonomia. Recognition of these patterns, combined with onconeural antibody testing, underpins current diagnostic criteria established by the International Panel on Autoimmune Encephalitis (Graus et al. 2021).","pathophysiology":"Anti-Ma2 antibody\u2013mediated paraneoplastic encephalitis involves a breach of central tolerance against neuronal onconeural antigens. Tumor cells aberrantly express Ma2 proteins, provoking CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell activation and B-cell maturation with high-affinity IgG1 production. Antibody binding to Ma2 epitopes on neuronal nuclei induces nuclear envelope disruption and loss of neuronal integrity through complement fixation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Intracellular antigen targeting also drives epitope spreading, with subsequent generation of T-cell responses against additional neuronal antigens. Genetic susceptibility involves HLA-DRB1*01:01 and HLA-DQB1*05:01 alleles, which increase antigen presentation efficiency. Inflammatory mediators such as IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17 accumulate in affected regions, promoting blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Metabolically, neurons under immune attack upregulate aerobic glycolysis and reactive oxygen species generation, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. The process evolves over weeks, with initial immune activation followed by irreversible neuronal loss if untreated. Compensatory synaptic sprouting may temporarily preserve function but fails as antibody titers rise, explaining the progressive clinical decline observed without prompt immunotherapy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present subacutely over 2\u20136 weeks with neuropsychiatric and neurological deficits. Early symptoms include progressive memory impairment, personality changes, depression, and insomnia. Within 1\u20132 weeks, focal seizures arise in approximately 60% of cases, often refractory to standard anticonvulsants. Neurological examination reveals anterograde amnesia, confabulation, vertical gaze palsy if midbrain involvement occurs, and cerebellar signs in 25% of patients. Pediatric presentations are rare but may mimic acute behavioral disorders rather than frank limbic dysfunction. Adults aged 20\u201340 years show the highest incidence; elderly patients more commonly display rapid cognitive decline with overlapping cerebrovascular features. Gender differences focus on male predominance due to testicular tumor association; females with teratomas more often manifest anti-NMDA phenotypes instead. Systemic manifestations include low-grade fever and weight loss in 30\u201340% as paraneoplastic markers. Severity is graded using the modified Rankin Scale; 45% present with mRS \u22653. Without treatment, progression to coma and autonomic instability occurs over 3\u20134 months, with mortality rates up to 60%.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on subacute memory loss, seizures, or sleep disorder in a male patient aged 20\u201340 triggers paraneoplastic panel ordering per AAN 2023 guidelines.

IVIG 2 g/kg divided over 2\u20135 days may be added concurrently (per EFNS 2021 guidelines). Tumor resection (orchiectomy) should occur within 2 weeks of diagnosis to remove antigen source (per NCCN 2022 consensus). Tier 2 (Second-line): Rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks or cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV monthly for six cycles if inadequate response by week 4 (per AAN 2022 Statement). Tier 3 (Third-line): Mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily or tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/day reserved for refractory cases after Tier 2 failure, with duration guided by clinical response for up to 12 months (per European Society for Neuro-Oncology 2020 consensus). Supportive therapies include antiepileptic drugs tailored to seizure type (levetiracetam 1,000\u20133,000 mg/day) and symptomatic treatments for dysautonomia or sleep disturbances, adjusting doses per renal function. Regular monitoring includes CBC, liver enzymes, and immunoglobulin levels every 4\u20136 weeks.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up should occur every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, then monthly until six months and quarterly thereafter for two years (per NCCN 2022 guidelines). Monitor neurological status via modified Rankin Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment with target MoCA >26. Laboratory surveillance includes CBC, renal and liver function tests every month during immunotherapy and every three months thereafter. Annual scrotal ultrasound for two years detects recurrent germ cell tumors; PET/CT at six and twelve months as indicated. Long-term complications include persistent cognitive deficits in 40% and seizure recurrence in 20%. One-year progression-free survival is 75%, five-year overall survival 60% when combined immunotherapy and tumor removal (per Graus et al. 2021). Rehabilitation involves cognitive therapy sessions twice weekly for three months, followed by outpatient neuropsychology. Patient education emphasizes prompt reporting of new neurologic symptoms, medication adherence, and fertility preservation discussions. Driving may resume after three seizure-free months under supervision. Support organizations: Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome Foundation, American Brain Foundation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Anti-Ma2 antibodies most commonly indicate testicular germ cell tumors; remember \u201cMa for Male gonads.\u201d 2. Limbic encephalitis with rapid memory loss and seizures in a young man should prompt paraneoplastic antibody testing immediately. 3. MRI FLAIR hyperintensity in hippocampi appears in only two-thirds of cases; absence does not exclude diagnosis. 4. First-line therapy combines high-dose steroids, IVIG, and tumor resection within two weeks to optimize outcomes. 5. Tier-based immunotherapy ensures escalation only as needed, balancing efficacy against infection risk. 6. Misattributing cerebellar signs to anti-GAD or anti-CRMP5 can delay correct tumor identification and worsen prognosis. 7. Recent consensus (Graus et al. 2021) refined definitions, stipulating \u226580% specificity for onconeural antibodies for paraneoplastic syndromes. 8. Cost-effectiveness analyses show early antibody testing reduces hospital stay duration by 30% and overall costs by 25%.","references":"1. Graus F, Titulaer MJ, Balu R, et al.

What is her McDonald criteria?","options":["Fulfilling both space and time","Fulfilling only space but not time","Not fulfilling both space and time"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Not fulfilling both space and time","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: Not fulfilling both space and time. According to the 2017 McDonald criteria, dissemination in space (DIS) requires \u22651 T2 lesion in at least two of four typical CNS regions (periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal cord) (Thompson et al., 2018). A single periventricular lesion meets only one region, thus DIS is not met. Dissemination in time (DIT) requires simultaneous presence of enhancing and nonenhancing lesions or a new lesion on follow-up MRI, which is not provided. Options A and B are incorrect because DIS is not fulfilled, and therefore neither DIS nor DIT criteria are satisfied.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS, classified in ICD-11 under 8A40. The McDonald criteria (first 2001, latest 2017 revision) operationalize MRI and clinical features for MS diagnosis. DIS and DIT are central concepts, replacing previous CIS definitions when MRI evidence of lesions at different times and places is demonstrated. The optic nerve is not one of the four typical regions for DIS scoring, but optic neuritis qualifies as a clinical attack. MRI lesion distribution reflects perivenular inflammation around small veins in white matter.","pathophysiology":"MS pathogenesis involves autoreactive T-cells crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier, initiating demyelination and neuroaxonal injury. In optic neuritis, inflammatory demyelination of the optic nerve causes conduction block. Periventricular lesions reflect the perivenular pattern of inflammation driven by Th17 cells and B-cell aggregates in meninges. Acute lesions show macrophage-mediated myelin phagocytosis, while chronic lesions exhibit gliosis and axonal loss.","clinical_manifestation":"Optic neuritis presents with unilateral painful vision loss over days, visual field defects, and afferent pupillary defect. MS CIS patients with one CNS lesion have a ~30% risk of developing MS at 5 years if DIS criteria are not met, versus ~50\u201380% if DIS is fulfilled (Miller et al., 2003). Clinical variants include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, which requires AQP4 antibody testing.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: brain and spinal cord MRI with and without gadolinium to assess number, location, and enhancement of lesions. Gd enhancement indicates active lesions. Second-tier: CSF analysis for oligoclonal bands, which can substitute for DIT under 2017 criteria (positive OCB = DIT) with sensitivity ~85% and specificity ~70% (Thompson et al., 2018). Visual evoked potentials may detect subclinical lesions. Serum AQP4 and MOG-IgG testing to exclude NMOSD/MOGAD.","management_principles":"Acute optic neuritis is treated with high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day \u00d7 3\u20135 days) to hasten recovery (Optic Neuritis Study Group, 1992). Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS (e.g., interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate) should be considered when MS diagnosis is confirmed. No DMT is indicated if MS criteria are not met, but monitoring MRI annually is recommended.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should have a follow-up MRI at 3\u20136 months to assess new lesions. Visual function and OCT to monitor RNFL thickness can evaluate axonal loss. Annual neurological exam to detect new clinical events. If DIS or OCBs become positive, re-evaluation for DMT initiation is indicated.","clinical_pearls":"1. Single periventricular lesion does not fulfill DIS\u2014need \u22652 regions. 2. Oligoclonal bands in CSF can satisfy DIT in McDonald 2017. 3. Optic neuritis CIS has varied MS conversion risk based on MRI. 4. Serum AQP4/MOG\u2013IgG testing is crucial when optic neuritis is severe or bilateral. 5. High-dose steroids accelerate visual recovery but do not alter MS risk.","references":"1.
