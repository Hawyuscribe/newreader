[{"question_number":"8","question":"A patient presents with upper limb numbness, loss of pain sensation, and is burning her hands. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Syringomyelia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Syringomyelia","subspecialty":"Neuroanatomy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct because a central cavity (syrinx) in the spinal cord interrupts decussating anterior commissural fibers, producing a \u2018cape-like\u2019 loss of pain and temperature in the upper limbs with preserved position and vibration. No other diagnosis fits this dissociated sensory loss pattern.","conceptual_foundation":"Syringomyelia (ICD-11 8A44) involves a fluid-filled cavity within the central canal of the spinal cord, often associated with Chiari I malformation. Differential includes anterior spinal artery infarct, transverse myelitis, and brachial plexopathy.","pathophysiology":"A syrinx expands within the cord, stretching and destroying decussating spinothalamic fibers at the level of the lesion. Dorsal columns (vibration/position) and corticospinal tracts (motor) are initially spared until the syrinx enlarges.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is insidious. Patients report glove-and-staple anesthesia of pain/temp in the hands and arms, with burning dysesthesias. Motor weakness and muscle wasting occur later. Chiari-related syringes often present in adults aged 20\u201340.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI of the spine shows a fluid-filled cavity within the cord on T2-weighted images. CT myelography is an alternative if MRI is contraindicated. Evaluate for Chiari malformation with cranial MRI.","management_principles":"Surgical decompression of the foramen magnum in Chiari I\u2013associated syringomyelia or direct syrinx drainage via syringopleural shunt can halt progression and relieve symptoms. Conservative management with physical therapy is reserved for mild cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat MRI 6\u201312 months post-surgery to assess syrinx size. Monitor neurological exam every 3\u20136 months. Adjust rehabilitation to maintain strength and prevent contractures.","clinical_pearls":"1. Dissociated sensory loss (pain/temp only) in a \u2018shawl\u2019 distribution is pathognomonic. 2. Always image the entire neuraxis to identify associated malformations. 3. Early surgical referral can prevent permanent deficits. 4. Syringomyelia may present with Charcot joints due to loss of pain sensation. 5. Look for dissociated Horner\u2019s syndrome if the syrinx extends to T1\u2013T2 levels.","references":"1. Heiss JD, et al. Syringomyelia Pathophysiology.

It receives direct input from retinal ganglion cells via the optic tract and projects to the occipital lobe through the optic radiations. Option A (Medial geniculate body) relays auditory information, not visual; option C (VPMN of thalamus) relays somatosensory information from the face and head; option D (Pulvinar nucleus) is involved in visual attention and integration but is not the direct relay for primary visual signals to the cortex.","conceptual_foundation":"The visual pathway begins at the retina, with retinal ganglion cell axons forming the optic nerve, crossing at the chiasm, and continuing as the optic tracts. These fibers synapse in the LGB, which is organized into six layers (magnocellular and parvocellular). From the LGB, the optic radiations (Meyer's and Baum's loops) carry information to the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17) in the occipital lobe. The LGB\u2019s role as the thalamic relay is fundamental to conscious vision.","pathophysiology":"Lesions at the LGB produce contralateral homonymous hemianopia, often with macular sparing if the lesion is small due to dual blood supply. Damage proximal to the radiations in the optic tract results in incongruous defects, whereas radiations lesions cause quadrantanopias depending on whether Meyer's loop (superior quadrant spared) or Baum's loop (inferior quadrant spared) is affected.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with LGB lesions characteristically present with contralateral homonymous hemianopia. If the lesion selectively involves Meyer's loop, a superior quadrantanopia ('pie in the sky') is seen; if Baum's loop, an inferior quadrantanopia ('pie on the floor'). Visual field testing by automated perimetry confirms the defect pattern.","diagnostic_approach":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high-resolution T1/T2 sequences localizes thalamic lesions. Visual field perimetry quantifies the defect. Computed tomography (CT) may detect hemorrhage or mass lesions but lacks thalamic resolution. No routine laboratory tests apply.","management_principles":"Treatment targets the underlying etiology: ischemic stroke management with antiplatelet therapy and risk factor control, demyelinating lesions with corticosteroids, or tumor resection/radiation. Visual rehabilitation includes compensatory strategies and prism lenses.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial perimetry every 3\u20136 months monitors field recovery or progression. MRI follow-up at 3\u20136 months assesses lesion evolution. Referral to low-vision services and orientation-mobility training optimizes functional adaptation.","clinical_pearls":"1. The LGB has six layers organized by input from each eye: magnocellular (motion) and parvocellular (detail/color). 2. Lesions of optic radiations produce quadrantanopia depending on loop involvement. 3. Macular sparing suggests dual blood supply from MCA and PCA. 4. Relative afferent pupillary defect localizes to pregeniculate lesions. 5. 'Pie in the sky' = Meyer's loop (temporal lobe) lesion.","references":"1. Purves D, Augustine GJ, Fitzpatrick D, et al.

Option A correctly localizes the lesion. Option B is incorrect because the occipito-parietal region is part of the dorsal stream, which mediates spatial processing (\u2018where/how\u2019), not the configural analysis of faces required for recognition.","conceptual_foundation":"Visual processing in the brain is segregated into two main pathways: the ventral stream (\u2018what\u2019) for object and face recognition travels from the primary visual cortex (V1) through the occipito-temporal region to the inferior temporal cortex, including the fusiform face area. The dorsal stream (\u2018where/how\u2019) passes through the occipito-parietal region and mediates spatial awareness and motion perception. Prosopagnosia is classified as an acquired visual agnosia in ICD-11 (6B20.0), a deficit in recognizing previously familiar faces with preserved general visual function.","pathophysiology":"Normal face recognition depends on the fusiform gyrus\u2019s ability to process configural information of facial features. A lesion here disrupts the integration of facial features into a cohesive percept, leading to selective inability to recognize familiar faces. Other visual modalities (color, motion, object recognition) remain intact because their processing relies on different cortical areas.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with acquired prosopagnosia present with a history of head trauma, stroke, or focal lesion of the right fusiform gyrus and demonstrate inability to identify familiar individuals by face alone, often using alternative cues such as voice or clothing. They may fail to recognize their own reflection. Standard visual acuity and fields remain normal.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by standardized tests such as the Benton Facial Recognition Test and Cambridge Face Memory Test. MRI typically reveals a lesion in the fusiform gyrus. Functional neuroimaging (fMRI or PET) shows reduced activation in the fusiform face area during face-viewing tasks.","management_principles":"No pharmacologic treatment reverses prosopagnosia. Rehabilitation focuses on compensatory strategies, including training patients to recognize distinctive facial features or rely on non-facial identifiers (voice, gait). Occupational therapy can help patients develop routines to mitigate daily life challenges.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular neuropsychological assessments track compensatory strategy efficacy. Patients benefit from follow-up visits every 3\u20136 months to adjust training programs and evaluate for potential recovery, especially if the underlying lesion is from a stroke with expected neural plasticity.","clinical_pearls":"1. Prosopagnosia arises from ventral stream lesions, especially the right fusiform gyrus. 2. It spares other visual modalities\u2014object and color recognition remain intact. 3. Standard face recognition tests (Benton, Cambridge) help confirm the diagnosis. 4. Compensatory strategies (voice, clothing cues) are essential for patient adaptation. 5. Right hemisphere lesions are more commonly implicated than left.","references":"1. Kanwisher N, McDermott J, Chun MM.
