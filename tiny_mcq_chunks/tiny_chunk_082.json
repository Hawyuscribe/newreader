In a patient with acute diffusion\u2010weighted imaging showing multiple infarctions confined to one cerebral hemisphere, the next best step is vascular imaging to identify large\u2010vessel stenosis or occlusion. CTA provides rapid, high\u2010resolution visualization of intracranial and extracranial vessels and can detect stenoses, occlusions, dissections, and atherosclerotic plaque (AHA/ASA Guideline 2018). Doppler ultrasound (option B) only assesses extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries and lacks intracranial detail. MRA (option C) can assess intracranial vessels but is slower, less available in the acute setting, and may be contraindicated in patients with pacemakers or severe renal impairment for contrast-enhanced studies.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute ischemic stroke results from sudden reduction in cerebral blood flow due to arterial occlusion. Identification of occlusive pathology within the intracranial or extracranial circulation is vital for therapeutic decisions, including thrombectomy. Imaging modalities include noncontrast CT, CT perfusion, CTA, MR diffusion, and MRA. The 2018 AHA/ASA guidelines recommend CTA as the primary vascular imaging in acute stroke evaluation when endovascular therapy is considered.","pathophysiology":"Cerebral infarction occurs when embolic or thrombotic occlusion of an artery leads to cessation of blood flow, causing energy failure, ionic pump dysfunction, cytotoxic edema, and eventual neuronal death. Multiple territorial infarcts on one side typically indicate embolic showering from proximal large\u2010vessel disease (e.g., carotid plaque) or cardiac source with preferential flow. Vascular imaging via CTA elucidates stenotic or occlusive lesions, informing secondary prevention and revascularization strategies.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with acute cortical infarctions present with sudden neurological deficits localized to the affected hemisphere, such as hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, aphasia (if dominant side), or neglect (if nondominant side). Multiple DWI lesions may correlate with fluctuating symptoms or hemodynamic instability. Recognizing the pattern of infarcts is critical for localizing the lesion and identifying the likely vascular distribution.","diagnostic_approach":"In acute stroke, initial imaging is noncontrast CT to rule out hemorrhage. DWI MRI confirms infarction. Next, CTA of head and neck (first tier) rapidly assesses vessel patency (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90% for large\u2010vessel occlusion). If CTA contraindicated, MRA is second tier (sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%). Doppler US is third tier for carotid screening with sensitivity 88%, specificity 94% for \u226570% stenosis but misses intracranial lesions. CTA should be performed within minutes of MRI to expedite thrombectomy decisions.","management_principles":"Management of acute ischemic stroke with large\u2010vessel occlusion includes intravenous tPA (if within 4.5\u2009h and no contraindications) and mechanical thrombectomy (if within 6\u2009h, up to 24\u2009h in select cases). CTA findings guide candidacy for endovascular therapy (AHA/ASA class I, level A). Control of blood pressure, glucose, and temperature is critical. Antiplatelet therapy should be initiated after hemorrhagic exclusion. Secondary prevention depends on etiology identified by CTA (e.g., carotid endarterectomy for \u226570% stenosis).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up vascular imaging depends on findings: carotid duplex at 2 weeks and 6 months for extracranial disease; repeat CTA/MRA at 3\u20136 months for intracranial stenosis. Neurological assessments should be done daily in the acute phase, then at 1, 3, and 6 months. Cardiac monitoring for atrial fibrillation should continue for at least 72\u2009h. Lifestyle modifications and vascular risk factor optimization follow chronic stroke guidelines.","clinical_pearls":"1. CTA is the gold standard for rapid vascular imaging in acute stroke to guide thrombectomy. 2. Multiple ipsilateral acute DWI lesions suggest proximal embolic source\u2014assess with CTA. 3. MRA can be used if CTA contraindicated but is slower and less sensitive. 4. Doppler US is useful for extracranial screening but cannot assess intracranial vessels. 5. Early vascular imaging shortens door-to-groin time, improving outcomes in thrombectomy candidates.","references":"1.

The patient\u2019s MRI reveals a lacunar infarction, a small\u2010vessel stroke subtype due to lipohyalinosis of penetrating arterioles. Carotid revascularization (endarterectomy or stenting) is indicated for symptomatic carotid stenosis \u226570% (NASCET criteria), not for lacunar stroke or stenosis below this threshold. Both right ICA 55% and left ICA 65% stenoses are below the 70% cut\u2010off for symptomatic revascularization, and the stroke is small\u2010vessel in origin. Aggressive medical management (antiplatelet, statin, blood pressure control, glycemic management) reduces recurrent stroke risk by approximately 30%\u201350%. Options A and B are incorrect because revascularization in moderate stenosis yields no net benefit and may increase periprocedural risk. Option D is incomplete, since medical optimization is required.","conceptual_foundation":"Lacunar strokes are defined by the TOAST criteria as small\u2010vessel occlusions leading to subcortical infarcts <15 mm, typically in deep brain structures (internal capsule, pons). Lipohyalinosis and microatheroma of penetrating arterioles result from chronic hypertension and diabetes. The ICD\u201011 classification places lacunar infarction under ischemic stroke, small\u2010vessel occlusion subtype. Differential includes Binswanger disease (subcortical leukoencephalopathy) and cortical infarctions; however, lacunes lack cortical signs (aphasia, neglect). Carotid stenosis management guidelines derive from NASCET and ECST trials, establishing thresholds for symptomatic and asymptomatic interventions.","pathophysiology":"Chronic hypertension induces hyaline arteriolosclerosis in small penetrating vessels, with deposition of fibrinoid material and endothelial dysfunction, leading to lumen narrowing and eventual occlusion. The internal capsule is supplied by lenticulostriate arteries branching from the MCA. When these become occluded, pure motor hemiparesis ensues. In contrast, large\u2010artery atherosclerosis involves plaque formation at carotid bifurcations causing embolic or hemodynamic infarcts, which would warrant carotid intervention if \u226570%.","clinical_manifestation":"Lacunar syndromes include pure motor, pure sensory, ataxic hemiparesis, and dysarthria\u2010clumsy hand, without cortical features.

Nimodipine. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by transient, segmental narrowing of cerebral arteries and thunderclap headaches. Calcium channel blockers, particularly nimodipine or verapamil, are first-line therapies based on observational studies demonstrating reduction in headache frequency and vasoconstriction duration (Ducros et al. 2011; Singhal 2009). IV hydration (option A) and ASA (option D) have supportive roles but do not address the underlying vasoconstriction. Steroids (option B) have not been shown to improve outcomes and may worsen vasoconstriction. Nimodipine at 60 mg orally every 4 hours is commonly used, leading to clinical improvement in over 80 percent of patients.","conceptual_foundation":"RCVS falls under ICD-11 code 8A44 and is distinct from intracranial vasculitis. It presents with recurrent thunderclap headaches over one to four weeks and reversible segmental vasoconstriction on angiography. Differential diagnoses include PACNS, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. The syndrome was first described in the 1980s and formalized in 2007 consensus criteria emphasizing reversibility within three months.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral arteries maintain tone via neural, myogenic, and endothelial factors. In RCVS, dysregulation of cerebral vascular tone leads to transient constriction of medium- to large-sized arteries. Proposed mechanisms include sympathetic overactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Endothelial dysfunction decreases nitric oxide availability, while sympathetic hyperstimulation leads to vasospasm. Triggers include vasoactive substances, postpartum state, and exertion. The reversible nature distinguishes it from vasculitis where inflammation causes permanent vessel damage.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinically, RCVS patients experience sudden, severe thunderclap headaches often reaching peak intensity within seconds. Neurological deficits occur in one-third due to cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic strokes, or reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. Typical age is 20 to 50 years with a female predominance. Symptoms recur multiple times over days to weeks. Resolution of vasoconstriction and headaches occurs within one to three months in most cases.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes noncontrast CT to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage, followed by vascular imaging with CTA, MRA, or DSA demonstrating segmental narrowing and dilatation (\u2018string-of-beads\u2019). CSF is typically normal or shows minimal protein elevation, distinguishing RCVS from vasculitis. Diagnostic criteria require angiographic reversibility within 12 weeks. Transcranial Doppler may monitor vasoconstriction severity noninvasively.","management_principles":"First-line treatment is oral nimodipine 60 mg every 4 hours for 4 to 8 weeks. Alternative calcium channel blockers such as verapamil may be used. Supportive measures include adequate hydration and withdrawal of triggers. Antiplatelet therapy with ASA is not routinely indicated unless there is concurrent ischemic stroke. Corticosteroids are not recommended and may prolong vasoconstriction. Analgesics are used for headache management but opioids should be minimized to avoid rebound headaches.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should undergo follow-up vascular imaging at 6 to 12 weeks to document resolution. Clinical follow-up focuses on headache resolution and neurologic deficits. Rechallenge of vasoactive triggers is discouraged. Long-term prognosis is excellent with full recovery in over 90 percent if diagnosed and managed promptly.","clinical_pearls":"1. Thunderclap headache is the hallmark of RCVS and should prompt vascular imaging. 2. Nimodipine is first-line and improves outcomes in over 80 percent of cases. 3.

Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). DAVFs often present in older adults with a slowly progressive, fluctuating myelopathy manifesting as chronic paraparesis, sphincter dysfunction, and sensory disturbances (Katsanos et al., 2017). Option A (AVM) typically causes acute hemorrhage or high\u2010output cardiac failure when large, not chronic fluctuating symptoms. Option B (cavernoma) presents with seizures or acute hemorrhage, rarely with progressive paraparesis. Option D (fibrocartilaginous embolism) causes acute spinal cord infarction with sudden onset, not chronic fluctuation.","conceptual_foundation":"DAVFs are abnormal direct connections between meningeal arteries and dural venous sinuses or cortical veins, classified under ICD-11 9A04.1. They differ from spinal AVMs by location and venous drainage patterns. Historical classification by Cognard and Borden defines risk based on cortical venous reflux. Differential for chronic myelopathy includes spondylotic cord compression, transverse myelitis, and neoplastic compression.","pathophysiology":"Normal venous drainage of the spinal cord is via valveless radicular veins into the epidural plexus. In DAVF, arterial blood under high pressure enters the venous side, causing venous hypertension, congestive myelopathy, and ischemia. Chronic venous hypertension leads to edema, demyelination, and gliosis of the spinal cord, explaining fluctuating paraparesis that worsens with Valsalva. Histology shows venous dilatation and perivenular inflammation.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms develop insidiously over weeks to months: initial leg heaviness and stiffness progressing to spastic paraparesis, sensory level, and bladder/bowel dysfunction. Fluctuations occur with posture changes or Valsalva maneuvers. On exam: hyperreflexia, Babinski signs, and sensory level. Pain is mild or absent. Onset age >50 years, male predominance ~2:1.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: spinal MRI shows longitudinal T2 hyperintensity, cord swelling, and flow voids on dorsal surface. Sensitivity ~90% for DAVF with modern sequences. Second\u2010tier: spinal digital subtraction angiography remains gold standard to localize fistula (specificity ~100%, sensitivity ~95%). Time\u2010resolved MR angiography can help screen with ~80% sensitivity. Pre\u2010test probability is moderate in chronic progressive myelopathy without clear compressive lesion.","management_principles":"Definitive treatment is endovascular embolization of the fistula or microsurgical disconnection; both achieve complete obliteration in >85% of cases (Cognard et al., 1995). Class I recommendation from neurovascular guidelines supports early intervention to prevent irreversible cord injury. Steroids and anticoagulation are ineffective and may worsen venous congestion. Physical rehabilitation post\u2010treatment improves gait and sphincter control.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat spinal angiography at 6 months to confirm fistula closure. MRI at 3 and 12 months to monitor for cord atrophy or residual edema. Neurological exams every 3 months in first year focusing on motor strength and sphincter function.

Without collateral support from the Adamkiewicz artery (T8\u2013L1), the anterior spinal artery territory becomes ischemic, affecting motor tracts (anterior horns and corticospinal tracts) and spinothalamic pathways. This results in flaccid paraparesis and loss of pain/temperature below the sensory level, while dorsal column modalities may be preserved.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop immediate or early postoperative paraplegia, often flaccid at onset, with a defined sensory level correlating to the infarct. Bladder and bowel dysfunction commonly co-occur. Recovery is variable; early signs of preserved reflexes or motor function below the level predict better outcomes.","diagnostic_approach":"Urgent spinal MRI is indicated within 6 hours to confirm ischemia (T2 hyperintensity in ASA territory).
