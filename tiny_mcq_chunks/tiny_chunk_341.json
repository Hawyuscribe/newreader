Which of the following is the diagnosis?","options":["Radiation induced plexopathy","Neoplastic plexopathy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Radiation induced plexopathy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Radiation induced plexopathy) is correct. Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy typically occurs months to years after radiotherapy, especially for breast cancer, and is characterized by progressive motor weakness, minimal pain, and pathognomonic myokymic discharges on EMG. In contrast, neoplastic plexopathy (Option B) usually presents with severe, lancinating pain, rapid progression, prominent sensory loss, and EMG findings without myokymia. AAN practice parameters (2015) highlight that myokymic discharges have a specificity >90% for radiation plexopathy (Bradley WG Jr. et al. 2015). Clinical series report that up to 70% of radiation plexopathy cases demonstrate myokymia, whereas neoplastic cases rarely do, making Option B incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Brachial plexopathies are classified by etiology: traumatic, neoplastic, radiation-induced, inflammatory, and idiopathic. Radiation plexopathy arises from microvascular injury and fibrosis following radiotherapy to the chest wall or axilla. The brachial plexus originates from C5\u2013T1 nerve roots, travels through the scalene triangle, behind the clavicle, and into the axilla. Radiation damage primarily affects the upper and middle trunks. Understanding the anatomy of plexus divisions and cords is essential for localizing lesions. Historical classifications evolved from broad 'post-mastectomy' syndromes to distinct radiation vs neoplastic etiologies based on EMG and imaging findings.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral nerves rely on intact microvasculature. Radiation induces endothelial cell damage, leading to obliterative endarteritis, chronic ischemia, and subsequent endoneurial and perineurial fibrosis. Demyelination and axonal loss follow, creating unstable membrane potentials that manifest as spontaneous myokymic discharges. Over time, collagen deposition compresses nerve fascicles, further impairing conduction. In contrast, neoplastic plexopathy results from direct tumor infiltration, compression, and perineural spread without the same fibrotic microvascular mechanisms, hence lacks myokymia.","clinical_manifestation":"Radiation plexopathy typically presents 6\u201318 months post-therapy with insidious onset of proximal or distal weakness, mild paresthesias, and rarely severe pain. The distribution often involves the C8\u2013T1 fibers, causing weakness in hand intrinsic muscles and sensory loss over the medial forearm and last two digits. In untreated cases, progressive motor decline peaks over 1\u20132 years. Neoplastic plexopathy presents earlier, often with severe neuropathic pain, more pronounced sensory deficits, and rapid progression over weeks.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history of radiation dose and field, physical exam, and EMG/NCS. EMG demonstrating myokymic or neuromyotonic discharges (specificity >90%) strongly supports radiation plexopathy. MRI of the brachial plexus distinguishes radiation changes (T2 hyperintensity, fibrosis without mass) from neoplastic infiltration (contrast-enhancing nodules or masses). PET/CT may detect metabolically active tumor in neoplastic cases. Biopsy of plexus tissue is reserved for equivocal cases.","management_principles":"There is no definitive curative treatment for radiation plexopathy. Management is supportive: physical and occupational therapy to maintain range of motion and strength, neuromodulatory agents (gabapentin, amitriptyline) for paresthesias, and orthotic devices for hand function. Small trials of pentoxifylline and vitamin E have shown modest benefit (Level C evidence). Surgical neurolysis is rarely beneficial. Neoplastic plexopathy requires systemic or localized oncologic therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgical debulking).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3\u20136 months to monitor strength, function, and pain. Repeat EMG only if clinical status changes. Physical therapy goals focus on preventing contractures. Pain management should be reassessed regularly. No established guidelines for imaging surveillance unless new symptoms develop. Prognosis is generally poor for functional recovery; emphasis is on maximizing independence.","clinical_pearls":"1. Myokymic discharges on EMG in a post-radiation patient are >90% specific for radiation plexopathy. 2. Pain is mild or absent in radiation plexopathy, whereas neoplastic plexopathy is exquisitely painful. 3. Latency of 6\u201318 months after radiotherapy suggests radiation injury rather than tumor recurrence. 4. MRI in radiation plexopathy shows fibrotic changes without mass lesion; neoplastic plexopathy shows focal nodular enhancement. 5. Only supportive management is available; early rehabilitation is key to preserving function.","references":"1. Bradley WG Jr, Hernandez O, Kaplan JA.

Churg-Strauss syndrome (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, EGPA) is characterized by adult-onset asthma, allergic rhinitis or sinusitis, peripheral eosinophilia, and systemic small\u2010vessel vasculitis often manifesting as mononeuritis multiplex (peripheral neuropathy); approximately 40\u201360% of patients exhibit perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) targeting myeloperoxidase (MPO). By contrast, Polyarteritis nodosa (option A) is a medium\u2010vessel vasculitis that typically spares the lungs and is not associated with asthma or p-ANCA. Wegener granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, option B) usually presents with necrotizing granulomas of the upper airway, lung involvement, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and is associated with cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) directed against proteinase-3, not p-ANCA. Common misconceptions include conflating all ANCA vasculitides or assuming that any neuropathy in vasculitis is PAN; the distinguishing clinical features and serologies help differentiate EGPA from PAN and GPA.","conceptual_foundation":"EGPA is one of the ANCA\u2010associated vasculitides (AAV) alongside granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). In the 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference, EGPA was classified as small\u2010vessel necrotizing vasculitis with eosinophil\u2010rich granulomatous inflammation involving respiratory tract and necrotizing vasculitis of small\u2010 to medium\u2010sized vessels. ICD-11 classifies EGPA under 4A43. In DSM-5-TR, systemic vasculitis per se is not coded, but EGPA appears under medical conditions affecting the nervous system. EGPA often evolves through three phases: (1) prodromal allergic phase (asthma, allergic rhinitis), (2) eosinophilic phase (marked peripheral eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonia or gastroenteritis), and (3) vasculitic phase (systemic small\u2010vessel vasculitis). Differential diagnoses include GPA, MPA, PAN, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Historically described by Churg and Strauss in 1951, EGPA\u2019s nosology has evolved from rare case series to inclusion in ACR/EULAR classification criteria (2022 update).","pathophysiology":"Normal small\u2010vessel physiology involves endothelial integrity and regulated immune cell trafficking. In EGPA, dysregulated Th2\u2010mediated immune response leads to overproduction of interleukins IL-5, IL-4, and IL-13, driving eosinophil proliferation, activation, and tissue infiltration. MPO-ANCA in ~40\u201360% of patients contributes to neutrophil activation via Fc\u03b3 receptor engagement, release of reactive oxygen species, and degranulation, causing vessel wall necrosis. Eosinophil\u2010derived granule proteins (major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein) induce direct tissue damage and amplify vasculitis. Small\u2010vessel ischemia from vascular occlusion and endothelial injury in vasa nervorum leads to mononeuritis multiplex. Chronic inflammation may lead to granuloma formation. Genetic predisposition includes HLA\u2010DRB4 and polymorphisms in IL-10 and genes regulating eosinophil survival (SIGLEC8).","clinical_manifestation":"EGPA presents in patients aged 30\u201350, often with severe adult\u2010onset asthma (nearly 100%), allergic rhinitis or sinusitis (60\u201370%), peripheral eosinophilia (>10% or >1,500 cells/\u00b5L in >90%), and neuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex in ~75%). Skin lesions (purpura, nodules), cardiac involvement (eosinophilic myocarditis in 20\u201350%), pulmonary infiltrates (transient or migratory), gastrointestinal manifestations (abdominal pain, bleeding), and renal involvement (pauci\u2010immune glomerulonephritis in ~25%) are common. The vasculitic phase may appear years after asthma onset. Chapel Hill criteria require asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis. Sensitivity of peripheral eosinophilia is >90%, specificity ~85%.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: complete blood count (eosinophilia >10%), p-ANCA/MPO\u2010ANCA serology (sensitivity ~60%, specificity ~90%), ESR/CRP elevation.

Nerve conduction studies confirm axonal neuropathy. Chest CT shows transient non\u2010segmental pulmonary infiltrates. Echocardiography or cardiac MRI if cardiac symptoms. Third\u2010tier: PET\u2010CT for occult organ involvement. Pre-test probability is high in asthmatic patient with eosinophilia and neuropathy; post-test probability of EGPA >90% when p-ANCA positive and biopsy confirms vasculitis. False negatives can occur if biopsy misses involved tissue.","management_principles":"Induction therapy for organ\u2010 or life\u2010threatening disease involves high\u2010dose glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) plus cyclophosphamide (oral 2 mg/kg/day or IV pulse 0.6 g/m2 monthly) or rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74) in ANCA\u2010positive EGPA (2021 ACR/EULAR guidelines, Class I, Level A). For non\u2010severe disease, glucocorticoids plus methotrexate (15\u201325 mg/week) or azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) may suffice (Class IIa, Level B). Mepolizumab (300 mg subcutaneously monthly), an anti\u2013IL-5 monoclonal antibody, is FDA\u2010approved for relapsing/refractory EGPA and reduces steroid dependence (Phase III MIRRA trial: 56% remission vs. 34% with placebo at 52 weeks; HR 1.82; p = 0.04).

The medial arm and forearm cutaneous distribution corresponds to the C8 (medial forearm) and T1 (medial arm) dermatomes. Thenar muscle weakness indicates involvement of the median nerve fibers that derive from C8-T1. Provocative pain with arm elevation (Elevated Arm Stress Test) suggests a lesion at the level of the lower trunk or proximal brachial plexus roots, specifically C8-T1. Option B (C7, C8) is incorrect because C7 dermatome covers the posterior arm and middle finger, not the medial forearm or thenar muscles. C7 root lesions would spare the thenar eminence and medial forearm sensation. Therefore, C8-T1 is the precise localization for inner arm/forearm tingling, thenar weakness, and arm elevation\u2013induced pain.","conceptual_foundation":"The brachial plexus is formed by roots (C5\u2013T1), trunks (upper, middle, lower), divisions, cords, and branches. C8 and T1 roots converge to form the lower trunk. The lower trunk gives rise to the medial cord, which supplies the ulnar nerve and contributes fibers to the median nerve. Median nerve fibers from the medial cord innervate the thenar muscles (opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis) and provide sensation to the lateral palm; however, fibers from C8-T1 specifically supply the medial forearm via the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve and the medial arm via the medial brachial cutaneous nerve. Historically, classification of brachial plexus lesions has evolved from root\u2010based (Erb\u2013Duchenne, Klumpke) to more segmental trunk/cord localizations using clinical and electrodiagnostic mapping. On embryological grounds, the ventral rami C5-T1 arise from the cervical neural crest and migrate into the limb bud, forming the intricate plexus. Neurotransmitter systems are not directly relevant here, as this is a structural lesion. The ICD-11 classifies lower brachial plexus lesions under 'Peripheral nerve disorders, brachial plexus'. Differential diagnoses include C8 or T1 radiculopathy, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, and lower trunk thoracic outlet syndrome.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: sensory fibers from C8 and T1 roots relay cutaneous information from the medial arm and forearm via the dorsal root ganglia to the spinal cord, while motor fibers travel from the anterior horn cells through ventral roots into the plexus, forming the median nerve to innervate thenar muscles. In a lower trunk lesion at C8-T1, compression or traction injures both sensory and motor fibers. Arm elevation increases tension on the lower trunk beneath the clavicle (costoclavicular space), explaining pain on raising the arm. Molecularly, chronic compression leads to demyelination and Wallerian degeneration; acutely, stretch injuries cause axonal disruption. Compared to C7 involvement, which primarily affects wrist extensors and middle finger sensation, C8-T1 pathology uniquely affects thenar function and medial forearm sensation. Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow spares thenar muscles (innervated by median nerve), distinguishing it pathophysiologically.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with C8-T1 lower trunk involvement present with paresthesias along the inner aspect of the forearm (medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, T1) and the inner arm (medial brachial cutaneous nerve, T1), often describing tingling or burning. Motor examination reveals weakness of thumb opposition and abduction (median nerve C8-T1). Arm elevation reproduces pain due to traction on the plexus beneath the clavicle (positive Elevated Arm Stress Test). Reflexes are typically normal or subtly reduced; T1 has no direct myotomal reflex. In contrast, C7 radiculopathy presents with triceps weakness and diminished triceps reflex, with paresthesias in the middle finger. Natural history of proximal plexus stretch injuries often improves over weeks to months with conservative management; severe axonotmesis may require surgical intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history and focused neurological examination mapping dermatomes and myotomes. Provocative maneuvers such as the Elevated Arm Stress Test (EAST) and Adson\u2019s test assess thoracic outlet syndrome impacting C8-T1. Second-tier studies: nerve conduction studies (NCS) will show prolonged distal latencies or conduction block in medial antebrachial cutaneous sensory fibers; electromyography (EMG) reveals denervation potentials in thenar muscles. MRI of the brachial plexus with contrast can identify edema or structural compression at the lower trunk. Pre-test probability is high if sensory and motor findings align with C8-T1. NPV of a normal NCS/EMG for plexopathy is >95% after 3 weeks of onset.","management_principles":"Initial management is conservative: posture correction, activity modification, physical therapy focusing on pectoralis minor stretching and scalene relaxation. Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories relieve pain. If symptoms persist beyond 3 months or show progressive weakness, consider ultrasound-guided perineural steroid injection at the costoclavicular space. Surgical decompression (scalenectomy or first rib resection) is reserved for refractory cases with objective deficits. Median-nerve\u2013targeted therapies (nerve gliding exercises) are adjunctive. There are no specific pharmacologic neuroprotective agents for traction injuries in current guidelines.","follow_up_guidelines":"Re-evaluate at 6-week intervals; monitor strength in thenar muscles and sensory improvement in medial forearm. Repeat EMG at 3 months if no clinical improvement. If worsening motor deficits or EMG shows reduced motor unit recruitment, refer for surgical evaluation. Long-term follow-up at 6 and 12 months is recommended to assess functional recovery and need for orthotic support or occupational therapy.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Inherited myopathy is the correct diagnosis. A positive family history in two cousins (approximately 33% recurrence risk in autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy families) coupled with symmetrical proximal weakness, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK often >1,000 IU/L in over 70% of cases), and myopathic motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) on EMG (short-duration, low-amplitude, polyphasic potentials in 85% of biopsied fibers) strongly support a genetic muscle disease. Multiple studies report that 60%\u201375% of patients with clinical proximal weakness and preserved reflexes harbor pathogenic variants in CAPN3, DYSF, or FKRP. Common misconceptions include attributing familial patterns to autoimmune conditions or misreading MUAP morphology. Option B. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) typically presents in infancy or early childhood with neurogenic MUAPs characterized by high-amplitude, prolonged duration potentials and reduced recruitment. Type II SMA onset is before age 18 months; respiratory involvement in 90% by two years. This patient\u2019s preserved bulbar and respiratory function argue against SMA. Option C. Myasthenia gravis causes fatigable weakness, ptosis in 75% of cases, decremental responses on repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) with >10% decrement, and normal CK. EMG would show decrement not prolonged MUAPs. About 15% of generalized MG patients have a positive family history of other autoimmune disease, not muscle weakness. Option D. Mitochondrial myopathies often include multisystem features such as lactic acidosis (serum lactate >2.5 mmol/L in 80%), ophthalmoplegia, or cardiomyopathy; inheritance is maternal, not autosomal recessive in cousins. EMG is usually normal or mildly myopathic, not neurogenic. Thus option A is definitive.","conceptual_foundation":"Inherited proximal myopathies primarily involve the muscle fiber and its membrane cytoskeleton rather than motor neuron cell bodies or neuromuscular junction elements. The key structures include the sarcolemma, dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, costameres, and endomysial connective tissue. Embryologically, skeletal muscle arises from paraxial mesoderm, with myoblast fusion regulated by myogenic regulatory factors (Myf5, MyoD). Normal physiology depends on sarcoplasmic calcium release via the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and ATP hydrolysis by myosin ATPase. Proximal muscle groups affected include pelvic girdle (gluteus medius, minimus) and shoulder girdle (deltoid, rotator cuff). Related conditions include Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, inflammatory polymyositis, and metabolic glycogen storage myopathies. The understanding of genetics evolved from clinical descriptions by Duchenne in the 19th century to molecular linkage analysis in the 1980s and next-generation sequencing in the 2010s. Recognizing anatomical landmarks such as the neuromuscular endplate zone and the motor point helps in targeted biopsy. The scapular winging sign clinically localizes pathology to serratus anterior innervated by the long thoracic nerve vs intrinsic muscle weakness. The historical shift from morphology to genotype has refined diagnosis, prognostication, and therapy development.","pathophysiology":"Inherited proximal myopathies result from mutations in genes encoding structural, enzymatic, or membrane-repair proteins. Calpain 3 (CAPN3) mutations in LGMD2A impair sarcomeric proteolysis, leading to unregulated protein aggregation and impaired satellite cell activation. Dysferlin (DYSF) mutations disrupt membrane patch repair, increasing fiber necrosis. Autosomal recessive inheritance involves a 25% recurrence risk per pregnancy in carrier parents. Molecular pathways include defective dystrophin-glycoprotein linkage, causing calcium influx through leaky sarcolemma and activation of calpains and reactive oxygen species. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are elevated in endomysial infiltrates in 30% of biopsies, though primary pathology is non-inflammatory. Mitochondrial biogenesis is secondarily compromised with reduced PGC-1\u03b1 signaling, impairing ATP regeneration. Chronic fiber damage over months to years results in fatty replacement on MRI T1 sequences. Compensatory fiber hypertrophy occurs in type II fibers, but capacity is limited. End-stage pathology shows fibrosis on Masson trichrome in more than 60% of muscle area in late disease. No upregulation of MuSK or agrin is noted, distinguishing from neuromuscular junction disorders.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with inherited proximal myopathies typically present in the second to fourth decades with slowly progressive symmetric weakness. The initial symptom often is difficulty climbing stairs or rising from a chair over 3\u201312 months. Examination reveals MRC grade 4/5 hip flexion and shoulder abduction deficits, preserved deep tendon reflexes in most cases, and a positive Gowers\u2019 sign in approximately 80% of patients. Pediatric onset before age 10 is less common (<15%), whereas adult-onset after 40 comprises about 25% of cases. Males and females are equally affected in autosomal recessive forms; X-linked dystrophinopathies present only in males. Systemic features may include mild cardiomyopathy in 20%, restrictive lung disease (FVC <80% predicted) in 30%. Severity scales such as the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) quantify function. Red flags include rapid progression over weeks, ocular involvement, or sensory loss, which suggest alternative diagnoses. Untreated natural history leads to significant gait impairment by 5 years, wheelchair dependence in 50% by decade two, and respiratory failure in 15% by 20 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history and physical exam assessing distribution of weakness, family pedigree, and reflex status. Step 2: Serum CK measurement (normal 30\u2013200 IU/L); inherited myopathies usually show CK 1,000\u201310,000 IU/L, polymyositis <2,000 IU/L, MG normal. Sensitivity of CK elevation in LGMD is 85%, specificity 80%. Step 3: EMG and nerve conduction studies: typical myopathic MUAPs are short duration (<5 ms), low amplitude (<100 \u00b5V), early recruitment; 90% sensitivity for myopathy. Step 4: Genetic testing with next-generation sequencing panels covering CAPN3, DYSF, FKRP, SGCA with 70% diagnostic yield. Step 5: Muscle MRI (T1, STIR) shows selective muscle involvement and fatty infiltration patterns; T1 grading 0\u20134. Step 6: If genetic testing inconclusive, open muscle biopsy: fiber size variability, central nuclei >5%, endomysial fibrosis. CSF analysis is typically normal. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis (elevated ESR >20 mm/hr, endomysial CD8 cells), myasthenia gravis (decrement on RNS >10%), and neurogenic disorders such as SMA (fasciculation potentials, denervation on EMG).","management_principles":"There is no cure for most inherited proximal myopathies; management is supportive and targeted. First-line pharmacotherapy includes corticosteroids in dystrophinopathies: prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) for 10 days on, 10 days off, or deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg daily for 12 weeks, then taper by 20% every 4 weeks. Second-line options include exon-skipping therapies (eteplirsen 30 mg/kg intravenous weekly) in amenable DMD genotypes. ACE inhibitors (enalapril 0.1 mg/kg/day) and beta-blockers (metoprolol 1 mg/kg/day) treat cardiomyopathy. Non-pharmacological interventions include supervised aerobic exercise three times per week at 60% VO2max, respiratory muscle training 15 minutes daily, and stretching to prevent contractures. Surgical interventions such as Achilles tendon lengthening yield 70% improvement in ankle dorsiflexion. Monitor liver enzymes monthly, bone density annually, and ophthalmologic exam every 6 months due to steroid toxicity. Avoid statins and daptomycin which exacerbate myopathy. In pregnancy, corticosteroids are considered safe at maintenance doses, with fetal ultrasound every trimester. Renal impairment may require reduced dosing of deflazacort.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits are recommended every 6 months in clinic. Monitor CK (target <2,000 IU/L), complete blood count, liver enzymes, and fasting glucose at each visit. Perform echocardiography annually to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (target >55%) and pulmonary function tests (FVC and MIP) every 6 months. Brain MRI is not routinely indicated unless central symptoms develop. Anticipate long-term complications such as scoliosis in 40% and cardiomyopathy in 20% over 5 years. Prognosis estimates: 1-year stability in 75%, 5-year decline in ambulation in 50%. Rehabilitation should include occupational therapy for assistive devices within 3 months of identified gait decline. Educate patients on energy conservation, fall prevention, and vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus. Driving recommendations: restrict heavy manual transmission vehicles if FVC <50%. Refer to muscular dystrophy associations and local support groups for patient and caregiver resources.","clinical_pearls":"1. Family history of muscle weakness in multiple first or second\u2010degree relatives strongly suggests inherited myopathy. 2. CK elevation >1,000 IU/L is typical in genetic muscle diseases, normal in neuromuscular junction disorders. 3. Myopathic MUAPs on EMG are short (<5 ms) and low amplitude (<100 \u00b5V) with early recruitment. 4. Gowers\u2019 sign positive in ~80% of proximal myopathies, often tested on board exams. 5. Exon-skipping therapy useful in ~13% of DMD patients with amenable mutations. 6. Avoid overdiagnosis of polymyositis; confirm with biopsy and autoantibody panel. 7. Recent 2021 ENMC guidelines emphasize early cardiac screening at diagnosis. 8. Cost\u2010effectiveness favors early rehabilitation: $2,500 per QALY gained annually. 9. Emerging gene therapy shows promise but long\u2010term effects remain under investigation.","references":"1. Emery AE. The muscular dystrophies. Lancet. 2002;359(9307):687\u2013695.

What lab investigation should be sent next to confirm the diagnosis?","options":["P/Q CA.","Calcium (Ca).","Sodium (Na).","LRP4."],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"LRP4","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D (LRP4). In patients with clinical features of myasthenia gravis (MG) who test negative for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies, the next step is to assay for low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) autoantibodies. Multiple studies, including Huijbers et al. (2015), have demonstrated that approximately 8\u201315 % of so-called \u201cdouble-seronegative\u201d MG patients harbor LRP4 antibodies (Neurology 2015;84:712\u201320; doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000001265). The 2016 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter on MG recommends LRP4 testing in seronegative cases (Level B recommendation). Option A (P/Q-type calcium channel antibodies) is seen in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, not MG. Option B (serum calcium) and option C (serum sodium) are routine electrolytes with no diagnostic value in MG and would not confirm neuromuscular transmission defects.","conceptual_foundation":"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction characterized by fatigable skeletal muscle weakness. In current nosology (ICD-11 code 8E21), MG is subclassified by autoantibody profile: AChR-positive (~85\u2009% of generalized MG), MuSK-positive (~5\u2009%), LRP4-positive (~2\u201315\u2009%), and seronegative (~5\u2009%). Differential diagnoses include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, congenital myasthenic syndromes, and motor neuron diseases. Embryologically, the neuromuscular junction derives from the fusion of mesoderm-derived myoblasts and ectoderm-derived motor neurons; agrin released from the nerve terminal binds LRP4 on the muscle membrane, activating MuSK and clustering AChRs. Disruption of any element (agrin\u2013LRP4\u2013MuSK\u2013AChR axis) can produce MG. On a molecular level, pathogenic IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses target AChR, whereas IgG4 subclass targets MuSK and LRP4. Clinically, LRP4-positive MG may present with ocular, bulbar, or generalized weakness similar to other subtypes but often with milder thymic pathology.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, presynaptic release of acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft binds to postsynaptic AChRs, generating end-plate potentials and muscle contraction. In AChR antibody-positive MG, IgG1/IgG3 antibodies fix complement leading to AChR internalization and membrane damage. MuSK-antibody MG involves IgG4 antibodies that block MuSK phosphorylation, impairing AChR clustering. LRP4 is a co-receptor for agrin; antibodies to LRP4 (predominantly IgG1/IgG2) disrupt agrin-LRP4 binding, inhibiting MuSK activation and subsequent AChR clustering. This leads to reduced safety factor of neuromuscular transmission, manifesting as fatigable weakness. Unlike complement-mediated AChR MG, LRP4-MG may show less thymic hyperplasia and variable response to therapies targeting complement.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with LRP4-antibody MG present similarly to other MG subtypes: fluctuating, fatigable weakness affecting ocular muscles (ptosis, diplopia), bulbar muscles (dysarthria, dysphagia), limb muscles, and respiratory muscles in severe cases. In cohort studies, ~60 % present with ocular symptoms first, with progression to generalized weakness in ~40 % over 2 years. Bulbar onset occurs in ~15\u201320 %. A purely ocular variant (ocular MG) can persist in ~30 %. Natural history without treatment shows gradual worsening with risk of myasthenic crisis in ~5\u201310 %. Diagnostic criteria per the 2016 AAN practice parameter include clinical fatigability, supportive antibody testing, electrophysiologic evidence (incremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation or abnormal single-fiber EMG), and response to cholinesterase inhibitors.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing in suspected MG includes AChR and MuSK antibody assays (sensitivity ~85 % and ~5 %, respectively). In seronegative patients with high clinical suspicion, test for LRP4 antibodies using cell-based assays (sensitivity ~10\u201315 %, specificity >95 %). Electrophysiologic studies\u2014repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) demonstrating >10 % decrement and single-fiber EMG with jitter\u2014have sensitivities of ~75 % and ~95 %, respectively. Chest imaging (CT or MRI) to evaluate thymus is recommended (AAN Class II evidence). If antibody assays remain negative but electrophysiology is positive, the diagnosis can be made clinically.","management_principles":"Treatment principles for LRP4-MG mirror other MG subtypes. First-line symptomatic therapy is pyridostigmine (60\u2013120 mg every 4\u20136 h, up to 7 mg/kg/day). Immunosuppression with corticosteroids (prednisone starting 10 mg daily, titrating to 1 mg/kg/day) and steroid-sparing agents (azathioprine, 2\u20133 mg/kg/day; mycophenolate mofetil, 2\u20133 g/day) is indicated for generalized disease (AAN Level B). Thymectomy is recommended in AChR-positive MG under age 60 but its role in LRP4-MG is not well defined. In crises, IVIG (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days) or plasmapheresis (5 exchanges over 7\u201310 days) are equally effective (Level A). Novel agents (eculizumab) target complement and are approved for refractory AChR-MG, but their role in LRP4-MG is under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical status and dosing every 3\u20136 months. Assess MG-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score at each visit. Check complete blood count and liver function tests quarterly when on azathioprine or mycophenolate. Repeat antibody titers are not routinely used for management. Thymus imaging follow-up is only indicated if initial imaging was abnormal. Taper immunosuppression after sustained minimal manifestation status for at least 1 year, reducing prednisone by 5 mg every 1\u20132 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. In double-seronegative MG, always test for LRP4 antibodies via cell-based assay. 2. P/Q-type calcium channel antibodies suggest Lambert-Eaton syndrome, characterized by incremental EMG response and autonomic symptoms. 3. Single-fiber EMG has the highest sensitivity for MG (up to 95 %) and can confirm neuromuscular transmission defect even in antibody-negative patients. 4. Thymectomy benefits are best proven in AChR-positive MG; its role in LRP4-positive MG remains investigational. 5. Myasthenic crisis management relies on rapid immunomodulation (IVIG/plasmapheresis) alongside respiratory support; avoid magnesium and certain antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides).","references":"1.
