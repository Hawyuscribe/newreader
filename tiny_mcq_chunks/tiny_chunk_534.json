What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Multiple Sclerosis","Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS)","Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS)","Neuromyelitis Optica"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Multiple Sclerosis","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. Multiple Sclerosis is the most likely diagnosis in a young female presenting with focal neurological deficits and MRI findings of demyelinating lesions disseminated in space (periventricular and spinal) and time (simultaneous gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions). The 2017 McDonald criteria specify that one clinical attack plus dissemination in space and time on MRI is sufficient to establish MS (Thompson et al., 2018), with reported sensitivity ~85% and specificity ~90% for early MS diagnosis. Option B, Clinically Isolated Syndrome, refers to a first clinical episode without meeting criteria for dissemination in time or space; however, this patient\u2019s MRI already fulfills both criteria. Option C, Radiologically Isolated Syndrome, describes incidental MRI findings in asymptomatic individuals and is excluded by the presence of clinical symptoms. Option D, Neuromyelitis Optica, typically presents with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis spanning three or more vertebral segments, severe optic neuritis, and aquaporin-4 antibody positivity; brain MRI lesions in NMO are uncommon in periventricular regions. Hence, MS is the diagnosis supported by clinical, radiographic, and diagnostic criteria.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple Sclerosis is an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder classified under ICD-11 code 8A40. It belongs to the spectrum of central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases alongside clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Historically described by Charcot in 1868, MS has evolved in classification from purely clinical subtypes (relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive) to incorporate radiographic and biomarker criteria. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derived from the ventral neuroepithelium migrate to form myelin sheaths around CNS axons. Periventricular white matter, optic nerves, brainstem, and spinal cord are preferential targets due to high myelin density and unique blood\u2013brain barrier properties. Differential diagnoses include small vessel ischemic disease, systemic lupus erythematosus with CNS involvement, sarcoidosis, and NMOSD. The 2017 McDonald criteria integrate clinical and MRI findings to streamline diagnosis, emphasizing CSF oligoclonal bands and lesion dissemination patterns. This nosology underpins the recognition of MS as a distinct neuroimmunological entity with genetic susceptibility loci in the HLA-DRB1 region.","pathophysiology":"Normal CNS physiology relies on rapid saltatory conduction of action potentials via myelinated axons, maintained by oligodendrocytes. In MS, an aberrant immune response\u2014predominantly involving autoreactive CD4+ T helper 1 and 17 cells, B cells, and macrophages\u2014targets myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and other myelin components. Antigen presentation by microglia and dendritic cells in the CNS triggers inflammatory cascades via cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1) and chemokines, leading to blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Complement activation and matrix metalloproteinases further damage myelin and expose axons. Demyelinated axons exhibit reduced conduction velocity, conduction block, and eventual axonal transection. Remyelination by oligodendrocyte progenitors may occur early but often fails, leading to chronic plaques. Genetic factors (HLA-DRB1*15:01, IL2RA, IL7R) and environmental triggers (vitamin D deficiency, Epstein\u2013Barr virus) modulate disease susceptibility. Spatial dissemination reflects multifocal immune infiltration along perivascular spaces; temporal dissemination is due to asynchronous lesion formation. The periventricular 'Dawson's fingers' appearance corresponds to demyelination along medullary veins, a hallmark of MS pathology on MRI.","clinical_manifestation":"Multiple Sclerosis most commonly presents in women aged 20\u201340 years with a relapsing-remitting course. Initial symptoms include sensory disturbances (40\u201360%), optic neuritis (15\u201320%), motor weakness (30\u201350%), and bladder dysfunction (20\u201340%). Fatigue, cognitive impairment, and heat sensitivity are frequent. Spinal cord lesions may manifest as paraparesis, spasticity, sensory level, and sphincter dysfunction, as seen in this patient\u2019s leg weakness and incontinence. Neurological exam often reveals nystagmus, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) quantifies impairment. Natural history of untreated RRMS shows cumulative disability accrual over decades, with conversion to secondary progressive MS in ~50% of patients within 15 years. Atypical presentations include primary progressive MS (~10%) and variants such as tumefactive demyelination. Pediatric MS may present with polyfocal syndrome and higher relapse rates. Prognosis is influenced by age at onset, sex, initial symptoms, relapse frequency, and MRI lesion burden.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic workflow for suspected MS begins with detailed history, neurological examination, and MRI of brain and spinal cord with and without gadolinium contrast. The 2017 McDonald criteria require dissemination in space (\u22651 T2 lesion in at least two of four CNS regions: periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal cord) and dissemination in time (simultaneous enhancing and non-enhancing lesions or new T2/gadolinium lesions on follow-up MRI). Sensitivity for early MS diagnosis is ~85%, specificity ~90%. CSF analysis for oligoclonal IgG bands increases sensitivity by 5\u201310%. Evoked potentials (visual, somatosensory) have lower sensitivity (60\u201370%) but can demonstrate subclinical lesions. First-tier investigations include MRI and CSF studies; second-tier may involve visual evoked potentials and serologies to exclude NMOSD (AQP4-IgG) or MOG antibody disease. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials are tertiary tests. Pre-test probability is high in young women with focal deficits; post-test probability exceeds 95% when McDonald criteria are met. Differential diagnostic pitfalls include small vessel ischemic disease and leukodystrophies.","management_principles":"Acute MS relapses are treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3\u20135 days), which accelerates recovery but does not alter long-term disability (Class I evidence). For severe, steroid-refractory attacks, plasma exchange is recommended. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are stratified by efficacy: first-line injectables (interferon beta, glatiramer acetate), moderate-efficacy oral agents (dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, fingolimod), and high-efficacy monoclonals (natalizumab, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab). Randomized controlled trials demonstrate reductions in annualized relapse rate by 30\u201370% and MRI lesion burden. Ocrelizumab showed a 46% reduction in progression for primary progressive MS (ORATORIO trial). Choice of DMT depends on disease activity, comorbidities, pregnancy plans, and safety profiles. Monitoring includes periodic MRI, laboratory tests for lymphocyte counts, liver and renal function, and JC virus serology for natalizumab. Symptomatic management addresses spasticity, bladder dysfunction, neuropathic pain, and fatigue with agents such as baclofen, botulinum toxin, anticholinergics, and amantadine.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up includes neurological assessments every 3\u20136 months, EDSS scoring, and annual brain MRI to monitor subclinical disease activity. Laboratory monitoring is individualized based on DMT: complete blood count and liver enzymes every 3 months for interferon and oral agents; JC virus antibody index every 6 months for natalizumab. Extended interval dosing may reduce progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy risk. Patient-reported outcome measures assess quality of life and cognitive function. Transition from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive phenotype is evaluated using clinical worsening without relapses over 6\u201312 months. Rehabilitation therapies including physiotherapy and occupational therapy are integrated early. Vaccination status is reviewed before initiating immunosuppressive therapies. Pregnancy planning involves switching to pregnancy-compatible DMTs and close monitoring. Annual ophthalmologic exam is required for fingolimod and other agents with macular edema risk.","clinical_pearls":"1. Dawson\u2019s fingers are ovoid periventricular lesions oriented perpendicular to the ventricles; their presence has high specificity for MS and aids differentiation from small vessel ischemic changes. 2. The 2017 McDonald criteria allow MRI-only demonstration of dissemination in time via simultaneous enhancing and non-enhancing lesions, enabling diagnosis at first clinical event. 3. CSF-specific oligoclonal IgG bands are present in >85% of MS patients and support diagnosis when MRI criteria are borderline. 4. Distinguish MS from NMOSD by lesion length in the spinal cord (NMOSD \u22653 vertebral segments) and AQP4-IgG serology. 5. Early initiation of high-efficacy DMT can delay disability progression; a treat-to-target approach based on no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) is increasingly adopted.","references":"1.

This condition often follows HSV encephalitis as a post-infectious autoimmune complication targeting the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (Dalmau et al. 2008). Patients classically present with psychiatric symptoms, memory deficits, and focal seizures including faciobrachial orofacial myoclonus, often in the setting of a normal brain MRI (Titulaer et al. 2013). Anti-Caspr2 antibody syndrome (Option B) generally presents in middle-aged to elderly males with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (Morvan\u2019s syndrome), neuromyotonia, or limbic encephalitis but rarely follows HSV infection and typically includes autonomic instability and sleep disturbances, which are not described here (Lancaster et al. 2011).","conceptual_foundation":"Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is classified under autoimmune encephalitides (ICD-11: 8A61.0). It arises when IgG antibodies target the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, leading to receptor internalization and synaptic dysfunction. Historically first recognized in young women with ovarian teratomas, it is now known that ~20% of cases follow viral encephalitis (especially HSV) as a trigger for an immune response against neuronal surface antigens. Differential diagnoses include other antibody-mediated encephalitides (e.g., LGI1, CASPR2, GABAAR), viral encephalitis relapse, and primary psychiatric disorders. Embryologically, NMDA receptors are widely expressed in the forebrain; limbic structures such as hippocampus and amygdala are particularly rich in NMDA receptors, correlating with memory/behavioral symptoms.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, NMDA receptors (heterotetramers of GluN1/GluN2 subunits) mediate synaptic plasticity and excitatory neurotransmission via glutamate. In anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, autoantibodies cross-link GluN1 subunits causing receptor internalization and hypofunction, disrupting excitatory/inhibitory balance. This leads to hippocampal dysfunction manifesting as memory impairment and behavioral changes, and cortical hyperexcitability causing seizures and orofacial dyskinesias. There is often mild CSF pleocytosis reflecting central inflammation, but MRI can remain normal because changes are predominantly synaptic rather than destructive.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically develop a prodrome of fever or headache, then psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, agitation, psychosis) over days. Within 1\u20132 weeks, neurological features appear: seizures (70% of cases), orofacial dyskinesias, autonomic instability, decreased level of consciousness, and movement disorders. In post-HSV cases, onset is delayed by 2\u20134 weeks after the acute infection. MRI is normal in ~50% of cases; EEG often shows diffuse slowing or extreme delta brush pattern. CSF pleocytosis is mild (lymphocytes <100 cells/mm3).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Serum and CSF testing for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies (cell-based assay; sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%). EEG for diffuse slowing or extreme delta brush (sensitivity ~30%). Brain MRI to exclude structural lesions (often normal). CSF analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands. Second-tier: Neuropsychological testing. Third-tier: FDG-PET may show hypermetabolism in limbic areas. Pre-test probability is high in young women post-HSV with new psychiatric and seizure phenomena.","management_principles":"First-line immunotherapy: high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day \u00d7 5 days), IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day \u00d7 5 days), or plasmapheresis. Early treatment within 30 days of symptom onset is associated with improved outcomes (Titulaer et al. 2013; 70% favorable recovery). Second-line: Rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d7 4) or cyclophosphamide for refractory cases. Tumor search (ovarian teratoma) with pelvic ultrasound/ MRI; removal if present. Symptomatic seizure management with standard antiepileptics.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical status and antibody titers every 3\u20136 months. Repeat CSF antibody testing at 6\u201312 months to assess for persistence. Taper immunotherapy over 6\u201312 months based on clinical improvement. Relapse occurs in ~12% of cases, more common if teratoma undetected or immunotherapy delayed; retreat with first-line agents.

Option A (5%) underestimates the prevalence seen in longitudinal cohorts (e.g., Ebers et al. 2000 reported ~10%), while Option B (10%) is at the lower end of estimates but does not reflect the midpoint consensus. Option D (20%) slightly overestimates the central tendency of most epidemiologic studies.","conceptual_foundation":"Benign MS is a clinical construct within the relapsing\u2013remitting subtype characterized by low relapse frequency and minimal accrual of disability over the first decade. It is recognized in ICD-11 under 8A40 (multiple sclerosis) with subcodes for course modifiers. Differential considerations include radiologically isolated syndrome and clinically isolated syndrome, both of which may mimic a benign course initially. Historically, benign MS was popularized in the 1980s with long-term natural history studies; however, it remains a retrospective designation and is not used to guide early treatment decisions. The term has been debated due to silent progression seen on MRI and subclinical neurodegeneration.","pathophysiology":"Relapsing-remitting MS features focal inflammatory demyelination with partial remyelination and variable axonal injury. In benign MS, the inflammatory burden is relatively low and reparative mechanisms\u2014oligodendrocyte precursor recruitment, remyelination\u2014are more efficient, leading to minimal fixed deficits. Over time, chronic microglial activation and diffuse neuroaxonal loss may still occur but at slower rates, preserving neurological function. Biomarkers such as neurofilament light chain tend to remain near normal in these patients.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with benign MS may experience occasional mild sensory or visual relapses with full recovery. They maintain EDSS \u22643 at 10 years, typically reporting only mild gait disturbance or minimal impairment in functional systems.

Clinical trial data (PRISMS study, 2001) report up to 60% of patients experiencing injection\u2010site reactions and transient paresthesias following subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of interferon beta. Teriflunomide, fingolimod, and natalizumab have distinct adverse-event profiles (hepatotoxicity, bradycardia/edema, and infusion reactions/PML risk, respectively) with no prominent paresthesias described in major trials or prescribing information.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis DMTs modulate immune function to reduce relapse rates and lesion accumulation. Interferon beta is a type I interferon that reduces antigen presentation and inflammatory cytokine release. It is dosed subcutaneously or intramuscularly, leading to local injection-site effects. Understanding the immunobiology of MS (perivenular demyelination mediated by autoreactive T cells) clarifies why modulation at the cytokine level (e.g., interferon signaling) is beneficial. Other DMTs work through sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation (fingolimod), dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibition (teriflunomide), or \u03b14-integrin blockade (natalizumab), each with unique safety profiles.","pathophysiology":"Interferon beta binds to the IFNAR receptor on immune cells, activating the JAK-STAT pathway, increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) and reducing pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3). Local injection into subcutaneous tissue can irritate cutaneous nerve endings, leading to transient paresthesia. Other DMTs have off-target effects: fingolimod causes lymphocyte sequestration in lymph nodes via S1P receptors with no direct neurotoxicity; teriflunomide inhibits pyrimidine synthesis in activated lymphocytes; natalizumab prevents leukocyte adhesion to endothelium. None directly irritate peripheral nerves at the injection site.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients on interferon beta commonly develop flu-like symptoms (fever, myalgia) 6\u201324 hours post-injection and localized erythema or paresthesia at the injection site. Symptoms tend to decrease in frequency and severity over 2\u20133 months of therapy. Rarely, systemic paresthesias unrelated to injection site may occur but are transient. Fingolimod can cause headaches or macular edema; teriflunomide can cause numbness in rare cases (<1%), and natalizumab infusion reactions manifest as fever, urticaria, or hypotension rather than paresthesia.","diagnostic_approach":"Adverse-event monitoring involves patient diaries and regular neurologic exams. Injection-site reactions are diagnosed clinically; no specific laboratory test is required. Providers should differentiate between local paresthesia and new neurologic deficits suggesting MS relapse. For fingolimod and teriflunomide, periodic ophthalmologic or hepatic monitoring is indicated; natalizumab requires JCV antibody testing and MRI surveillance.","management_principles":"Injection-site paresthesia from interferon beta is managed with rotation of injection sites, pre-medication with NSAIDs or acetaminophen, and application of ice. Persistent or severe reactions may prompt switching formulations (intramuscular vs. subcutaneous) or dose adjustment. No specific pharmacologic treatment for localized paresthesia is typically needed. In contrast, management of fingolimod-related bradycardia, fingolimod-induced macular edema, teriflunomide hepatotoxicity, or natalizumab PML risk follows separate guidelines.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up after interferon beta initiation includes visits at 1, 3, and 6 months to assess tolerability, injection-site reactions, and clinical relapses. Annual MRI to monitor disease activity. Patients reporting persistent paresthesia beyond 2\u20133 months should be re-evaluated for injection technique, skin infection, or alternative etiologies. Education on site rotation and injection technique is reinforced at each visit.","clinical_pearls":"1. Interferon beta injections often cause local paresthesia and erythema; rotating sites decreases incidence. 2. Pre-medication with NSAIDs 30 minutes before injection reduces flu-like symptoms and may lessen paresthesia. 3. Distinguish injection-site paresthesia from new MS sensory relapse by assessing distribution and timing relative to injection. 4.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)","Primary CNS Angiitis","Multiple Sclerosis","Viral Encephalitis ## Page 23"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most likely diagnosis in a 16-year-old with new-onset confusion and MRI demonstrating bilateral white matter changes is Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM). ADEM classically presents with an acute encephalopathic picture\u2014confusion, altered consciousness, and often fever\u2014followed by multifocal neurological deficits. MRI typically shows bilateral, asymmetric, poorly marginated T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter, sometimes involving deep gray matter structures. In contrast, Primary CNS Angiitis (option B) usually presents in adults with insidious cognitive decline, headaches, or stroke-like episodes and requires vessel-wall imaging or biopsy for diagnosis; MRI lesions are often more patchy and may involve both white and gray matter but without the classic postinfectious encephalopathy. Multiple Sclerosis (option C) most often presents in young adults (20s\u201330s) with discrete neurological deficits over time and MRI shows well-defined ovoid periventricular lesions, often perpendicular to the ventricles (Dawson\u2019s fingers). MS rarely causes an acute encephalopathy. Viral encephalitis (option D) can cause confusion and MRI changes, but typically involves specific regions (e.g., temporal lobes in HSV) and CSF pleocytosis with viral PCR positivity. Thus, ADEM best fits the clinical and imaging pattern described.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an acute, monophasic, immune-mediated demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that predominantly affects children and adolescents. It is classified in the ICD-11 under demyelinating diseases of the CNS (8A60.0) and by the International Pediatric MS Study Group as an acute demyelinating event distinct from multiple sclerosis. ADEM often follows a viral infection or vaccination by days to weeks. The pathological hallmark is perivenular inflammation with demyelination. Differential diagnoses include MS, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), acute necrotizing encephalopathy, metabolic leukoencephalopathies, and vasculitides. Historically, ADEM was first described in the context of post\u2013smallpox vaccination reactions in the 19th century, and its nosology has evolved to distinguish it from relapsing MS. The immune response involves auto-reactive T cells against myelin antigens (myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein), with cytokine cascades (IL-6, IL-17). Embryologically, oligodendrocytes arise from the ventricular zone in the late first trimester; ADEM targets these cells, leading to patchy demyelination. Key neuroanatomical pathways include the corticospinal tracts, optic radiations, and cerebellar peduncles\u2014explaining the multifocal deficits. White matter blood supply via long penetrating arterioles is susceptible to perivenular inflammation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) restricts immune cell entry. In ADEM, a preceding infection or vaccination triggers molecular mimicry: pathogen antigens resemble myelin proteins, leading to T-cell activation in peripheral lymphoid tissue. Autoreactive CD4+ T cells cross the BBB via upregulated adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) and secrete proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), activating microglia and macrophages. These inflammatory cells induce demyelination by phagocytosis of myelin sheaths and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Complement activation and antibody-mediated mechanisms contribute. Lesions are centered around small veins (perivenular), leading to poorly demarcated areas of demyelination on MRI. The temporal course is acute\u2014days to weeks\u2014with peak inflammation followed by remyelination and resolution in most cases. In contrast, MS involves both perivenular and parenchymal lesions, chronic plaque formation, remyelination failure, and relapses, whereas viral encephalitis features direct cytopathic effects, neuronal loss, and vasogenic edema in specific brain regions.","clinical_manifestation":"ADEM typically presents in children and adolescents (mean age 5\u20138 years, but up to teenage) with an acute prodrome of fever, headache, nausea, and malaise. Encephalopathy is a cardinal feature, present in >80% of cases, manifesting as confusion, lethargy, or even coma. Multifocal neurological deficits occur: motor weakness (60\u201370%), ataxia (40%), optic neuritis (30%), cranial nerve palsies (20%), seizures (15\u201320%), and meningismus (10\u201315%). Variants include acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL), with hemorrhagic necrosis and high mortality. The natural history without treatment leads to residual neurological deficits in 20\u201330% and mortality in <5%. Diagnostic criteria (International Pediatric MS Study Group, 2013) require a first polyfocal CNS event with encephalopathy and MRI showing diffuse, poorly demarcated white matter lesions. Sensitivity of MRI criteria is ~90%, specificity ~80% in distinguishing ADEM from MS in pediatric series.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic approach begins with MRI brain with and without contrast: essential to identify bilateral, asymmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in white matter, often involving deep gray matter (thalami, basal ganglia). Gadolinium enhancement is present in 50\u201360% of lesions. CSF analysis shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u201350 cells/\u00b5L), elevated protein (50\u2013100 mg/dL), and oligoclonal bands in only 10\u201320%, helping distinguish from MS (up to 90% OCB+). Infectious workup (viral PCR, bacterial cultures) is necessary to rule out encephalitis. Additional testing includes MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG to exclude NMOSD. Visual evoked potentials may show delayed P100 latency. Neuroimaging of the spinal cord should be performed if myelopathy is suspected. Brain biopsy is reserved for atypical cases or suspicion of vasculitis or neoplasm.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 20\u201330 mg/kg/day (max 1 g) for 3\u20135 days, followed by a tapering oral steroid course over 4\u20136 weeks. Observational data show >80% improvement in neurological status within 7\u201314 days of steroids; NNT of ~2 to achieve full recovery. In steroid-refractory cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days or plasma exchange (5\u20137 sessions) is effective. IVIG response rate is ~70%, PLEX response ~60%. Supportive care includes seizure management, intracranial pressure monitoring if cerebral edema is significant, and rehabilitation for residual deficits. There are no established disease-modifying therapies as ADEM is monophasic.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes neurologic examinations at 1, 3, and 6 months post-episode, with assessment of cognitive function, motor strength, and visual acuity. Repeat MRI at 3 months to document lesion resolution; persistent or new lesions should prompt reconsideration of MS or NMOSD. Annual neuropsychological testing is advised for cognitive sequelae. Steroid taper schedule should be monitored to minimize rebound inflammation. No long-term immunosuppression is typically needed unless relapses occur, in which case MS therapy may be considered. Education on recognizing new neurological symptoms is critical for early detection of relapse.","clinical_pearls":"1. Encephalopathy is required for ADEM diagnosis; its absence suggests MS. 2. Postinfectious onset within 2\u201330 days is common\u2014ask about recent illness or vaccination. 3. MRI lesions in ADEM are large, bilateral, poorly marginated, often with deep gray matter involvement. 4. Oligoclonal bands are rare in ADEM (<20%) but common in MS (>90%). 5. First-line treatment is high-dose steroids; consider IVIG or plasmapheresis if no improvement in 3\u20135 days.","references":"1. Krupp LB, Tardieu M, Amato MP, et al.
