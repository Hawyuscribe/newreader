These fibers are characterized by the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria beneath the sarcolemma, which can be visualized using modified Gomori trichrome stain. In KSS, the presence of RRF indicates a pathological increase in mitochondrial numbers due to impaired mitochondrial function and replication, which is a feature of mitochondrial disorders.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n- A) Necrotizing myopathy: This finding typically indicates a process of muscle fiber degeneration and necrosis, often associated with inflammatory myopathies or toxic myopathies. It does not reflect the mitochondrial proliferation seen in KSS and other mitochondrial myopathies.\n\n- C) Hyaline degeneration: Hyaline degeneration is characterized by the accumulation of amorphous material within muscle fibers, often seen in reactions to injury or degeneration but not specific to mitochondrial disorders. It is more commonly associated with toxic myopathies or ischemic conditions.\n\n- D) Fiber type grouping: Fiber type grouping refers to the clustering of muscle fibers of the same type, often seen in denervation or neuropathic processes. This pattern does not correlate with the mitochondrial dysregulation observed in Kearns-Sayre syndrome.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nKearns-Sayre Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder classified as a mitochondrial myopathy. It arises from deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and is characterized by a combination of ocular, cardiac, and neurological manifestations. Mitochondria are the cellular organelles responsible for energy (ATP) production, and defects in their function can lead to significant metabolic disturbances, especially in high-energy demanding tissues such as muscle and nerve.\n\nMitochondrial myopathies, including KSS, are often associated with alterations in the structure and function of mitochondria, which can be identified histologically through specific staining techniques. In addition to ragged-red fibers, other mitochondrial features can include cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency, which further aids in diagnosis.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiology of Kearns-Sayre syndrome involves the deletion of mitochondrial DNA, which leads to the impairment of essential mitochondrial functions. Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA) that encodes for proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation\u2014the process by which cells produce ATP.\n\nIn KSS, the deletions in mtDNA disrupt the synthesis of proteins required for the electron transport chain, leading to reduced ATP production. This inefficiency in energy production causes cellular stress and damage, particularly affecting tissues that depend heavily on aerobic metabolism, such as skeletal muscle, heart, and nervous system.\n\nThe accumulation of abnormal mitochondria results in the appearance of ragged-red fibers, which are indicative of the compensatory response of muscle cells to mitochondrial dysfunction. These fibers appear red under the microscope when stained with Gomori trichrome due to the excessive mitochondrial content, contrasting with normal fibers.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nKearns-Sayre syndrome typically presents in childhood, with a classic triad of symptoms:\n- Ophthalmoplegia: Difficulty in eye movement due to weakness of the extraocular muscles, often leading to ptosis (drooping of the eyelids) and external ophthalmoplegia.\n- Retinitis pigmentosa: A degenerative eye disease that leads to progressive vision loss due to retinal photoreceptor degeneration.\n- Cardiac conduction defects: These can manifest as arrhythmias or complete heart block, often requiring monitoring and possible pacemaker placement.\n\nAdditional features may include:\n- Muscle weakness and exercise intolerance due to myopathy.\n- Neurological symptoms such as ataxia, seizures, or intellectual disability.\n- Endocrine dysfunction, including diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism.\n- Hearing loss due to cochlear involvement.\n\nThe progression and severity of symptoms can vary widely among individuals, often depending on the extent of the mitochondrial involvement.\n\n## 5.

Myotonia. In congenital myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), neonatal EMG often fails to demonstrate the characteristic myotonic discharges seen in older children and adults. EMG in neonates may be limited by low muscle tone and technical factors, and electrical myotonia frequently appears later in infancy or childhood (McEntagart et al. 2011; Harper 2009).\n\nOption A (Hypotonia) is incorrect because EMG can indirectly suggest hypotonia via low\u2010amplitude, short\u2010duration, polyphasic motor unit potentials consistent with a congenital myopathy; hypotonia itself is a clinical sign rather than an EMG feature, but EMG does not \u201cmiss\u201d hypotonia\u2014it simply does not purport to measure tone. Option C (Delayed motor skills) and D (Failure to thrive) are developmental and systemic clinical features, respectively, and not EMG findings. The key nuance is that only myotonic discharges (and myopathic MU changes) are sought on EMG; of the listed features, myotonic discharges may be absent in the congenital period, whereas the others are not EMG features per se.","conceptual_foundation":"Congenital DM1 is the most severe end of the CTG repeat expansion spectrum in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3, part of the toxic RNA spliceopathy group. It is classified in ICD-11 under 8A60.01 Myotonic dystrophy type 1. Neonatal DM1 manifests with severe hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, and feeding difficulty; pure myotonia (electrical or clinical) may not be evident until later. The condition arises from expanded CUG repeats sequestering MBNL1, altering splicing of multiple transcripts, including CLCN1 (chloride channel) and DMPK itself. Embryologically, DMPK is expressed in developing skeletal muscle and brain, explaining multisystem involvement. Neuroanatomically, skeletal muscle fiber membranes show reduced chloride conductance; muscle biopsy reveals central nuclei and fiber size variation. Related conditions include DM2 (ZNF9 expansions) and congenital myopathies such as central core disease; differential considerations include spinal muscular atrophy type 1 and Pompe disease in neonates.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle relaxation is mediated by ClC-1 chloride channels; in DM1, CUG-expanded transcripts trap MBNL1 and increase CELF1, leading to mis-splicing of CLCN1 pre-mRNA, reduced ClC-1 expression, and myotonic discharges. In congenital DM1, the developmental state of muscle and incomplete chloride channel pathology delay the appearance of electrical myotonia. Additionally, toxic RNA gain-of-function affects insulin receptor and other transcripts, leading to endocrine and neurologic features. Early in life, compensatory upregulation of other ion channels may mask myotonic discharges until muscle maturation unmasks chloride channel dysfunction. The absence of EMG myotonia in neonates contrasts with the pronounced hypotonia due to muscle fiber immaturity and reduced DMPK kinase activity in utero.","clinical_manifestation":"Congenital DM1 presents at birth with profound hypotonia (neonatal floppy infant), respiratory distress requiring ventilation in up to 80% of cases, and feeding difficulties in over 90%. Polyhydramnios is common antenatally. Myotonia typically emerges after 6\u201312 months in approximately 60% of survivors; delayed motor milestones and failure to thrive persist. Cognitive impairment and behavioral issues appear in early childhood. Natural history without intervention includes high neonatal mortality (~30\u201350%) from respiratory failure. Surviving infants develop typical DM1 features\u2014facial weakness, ptosis, and myotonia\u2014in later infancy and childhood.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: clinical exam (floppy infant), family history, CK level (normal to mildly elevated). EMG in neonates often shows myopathic MU potentials but no myotonic discharges (sensitivity ~40% in first month). Genetic testing for CTG expansion (PCR, Southern blot) has >99% sensitivity/spec if repeat >100. Second\u2010tier: muscle biopsy rarely needed. Third\u2010tier: quantify repeat length by triplet\u2010primed PCR for prognostic correlation (larger repeats >1,000 correlate with congenital form). Pretest probability is high in a hypotonic neonate with DM1 family history (~PPV > 90%).","management_principles":"Supportive respiratory care (NIV or intubation), gastrostomy feeding tubes, physiotherapy to optimize motor development, and cardiac monitoring (risk of congenital heart block). No disease\u2010modifying therapy exists. Multidisciplinary care per European Myotonic Dystrophy Network guidelines (2018) recommends early pulmonary and nutritional support (Class I, Level B). Small\u2010molecule splicing modulators (metformin, tideglusib) are under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Frequent respiratory assessments (monthly in neonatal period), growth monitoring (weight/length weekly), developmental evaluations quarterly in first year, and annual cardiac ECG and echo. Monitor for endocrine complications (insulin resistance) biannually. Transition to pediatric neurology and pulmonology clinics by 12 months, then to adult neuromuscular services by adolescence. Neurocognitive assessments annually after age 2.","clinical_pearls":"1. EMG may be falsely negative for myotonia in congenital DM1; repeat after 6 months if suspicion remains. 2.

Studies show that cooling the muscle membrane prolongs sodium channel opening and increases persistent sodium current by up to 30%, precipitating stiffness within minutes (Cannon SC et al., 2000).\n\nOption A (Rest) is incorrect: Paramyotonia congenita myotonia is aggravated by repeated activity and cold more than rest; rest tends to relieve symptoms rather than trigger them (Statland JM et al., 2008).\n\nOption B (Exercise) is partially correct in cold conditions\u2014exercise alone may induce some myotonia but is not a classic trigger unless combined with cold. Isolated exercise triggers symptoms in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, not typical paramyotonia congenita.\n\nOption D (Glucose intake) is related to hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, where carbohydrate-rich meals can precipitate hyperkalemia and weakness, but is not a trigger in paramyotonia congenita (Cannon SC, 2010).","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita is a non-dystrophic myotonia classified under skeletal muscle channelopathies, specifically sodium channel myotonia. In the ICD-11, it is coded under 8E41.0 (Non-dystrophic myotonias). It is caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in SCN4A, and presents with cold- and exercise-induced muscle stiffness. Differential diagnoses include hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (also SCN4A), myotonic dystrophies (DMPK, CNBP), and congenital myopathies. The SCN4A gene maps to chromosome 17q23 and encodes the Nav1.4 \u03b1-subunit. Embryologically, skeletal muscle differentiation involves myoblast fusion and expression of voltage-gated sodium channels; SCN4A expression increases in late fetal development. Nav1.4 channels localize to the sarcolemma and T-tubules, interacting with \u03b21 subunits; they are critical for rapid action potential initiation and propagation. Mutations often affect the domain III\u2013IV linker region, impairing fast inactivation gates and causing membrane hyperexcitability.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle action potentials rely on rapid activation and subsequent fast inactivation of Nav1.4 channels to allow repolarization. In paramyotonia congenita, gain-of-function mutations (e.g., T1313M, R1448C) destabilize the fast-inactivated state, prolonging sodium influx and membrane depolarization. Cold temperatures further slow channel kinetics\u2014specifically altering the voltage dependence of inactivation by shifting it by approximately 10 mV in a depolarizing direction at 15 \u00b0C (Groome JR et al., 1999). The persistent sodium current leads to myofiber membrane hyperexcitability, repetitive action potentials, and clinical myotonia. Over time, depolarization can reach inexcitable levels, causing transient weakness. The process is aggravated by exercise due to accumulation of extracellular K+, further depolarizing the membrane.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present in infancy or early childhood with paradoxical myotonia: stiffness worsens with continued activity (e.g., repeated gripping) and cooling. The hands, face, and tongue are commonly affected. Episodes last minutes to hours and are precipitated by cold exposure (e.g., holding cold objects). Between attacks, transient weakness may occur. EMG shows myotonic discharges that intensify with cooling and exercise testing. On exam, delayed muscle relaxation is noted. There is no systemic involvement. Sweating and heat often relieve stiffness. Clinical criteria from Statland et al. (2018) require cold-induced myotonia plus genetic confirmation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing includes detailed history of cold sensitivity and myotonia, serum electrolytes (normal in paramyotonia congenita), and EMG with short exercise and cooling protocols. EMG sensitivity for sodium channel myotonia is >95% when cooling is applied (Weber F et al., 2001). Second-tier involves SCN4A gene sequencing; pathogenic variants are identified in ~98% of cases. Pre-test probability is high in patients with cold-aggravated myotonia; the positive predictive value of genetic testing approaches 100%. Third-tier advanced testing includes specialized functional assays in oocytes for variant pathogenicity. Differential includes chlorid channelopathies and muscle biopsy, but these are rarely needed.","management_principles":"Avoidance of cold exposure and use of warming garments is first-line (Level B). Mexiletine (50\u2013200 mg TID) is recommended (Class I, Level A) to stabilize inactive sodium channels and reduce persistent current; randomized trials demonstrate ~50% reduction in stiffness VAS scores (Statland JM et al., 2012). Alternatives include lamotrigine and carbamazepine (off-label, Level C). Acetazolamide may help via intracellular pH modulation, though evidence is limited. Supportive measures include physiotherapy to maintain mobility. Monitor for cardiac conduction effects when using mexiletine in patients >60 years or with underlying cardiac disease.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 6\u201312 months to assess symptom control, medication side effects, and adjust dosage. Regular ECG monitoring with mexiletine therapy (baseline and annually) is recommended. Periodic EMG may be repeated if clinical status changes. Long-term prognosis is favorable; most patients maintain functionality with therapy. Genetic counseling for families is advised due to autosomal dominant inheritance. Education on early warming during cold exposure and avoidance of known triggers remains paramount.","clinical_pearls":"1. Paradoxical myotonia worsens with continued activity and cold, distinguishing paramyotonia congenita from other myotonias. 2. SCN4A gain-of-function mutations produce a sustained sodium current; mexiletine reduces this persistent current by stabilizing inactivated channel states. 3. EMG with cooling test has near 100% sensitivity and specificity for sodium channel myotonia when standardized protocols are used. 4. Acetazolamide can be considered in refractory cases via intracellular acidosis, though evidence is limited to small case series. 5.

Patients with a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy can develop delayed brachial plexus injury due to radiation. Electrophysiologically, myokymic discharges\u2014characterized by spontaneous, rhythmic, grouped discharges of motor unit potentials\u2014are a hallmark finding in radiation-induced plexopathy, with a reported sensitivity of approximately 75% and specificity exceeding 90% compared to neoplastic plexopathy (Stanton et al. Neurology 2010 [1]; Scott et al. Muscle Nerve 2012 [2]). The absence of significant pain, the chronic temporal profile, and the presence of myokymia on EMG strongly favor radiation-induced injury. Although neoplastic infiltration of the plexus can cause weakness and sensory loss, it typically presents with severe, lancinating pain and electrophysiology shows fibrillation potentials without myokymia. No other options are listed; however, the chief alternative would be neoplastic plexopathy, which is less consistent with the EMG and clinical features described.","conceptual_foundation":"Radiation-induced plexopathy is classified under peripheral neuropathies caused by external agents in ICD-11 (ME84). It arises from iatrogenic injury to the brachial plexus following radiotherapy directed at the chest wall or axillary region, commonly used in breast cancer treatment. Differential diagnoses include neoplastic plexopathy (ME85) and Parsonage-Turner syndrome (acute brachial neuritis, MB50 in ICD-11). Historically described in the 1960s, the condition evolved as radiotherapy doses increased, leading to a peak incidence in the 1980s; modern techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) have reduced but not eliminated its occurrence. Embryologically, the brachial plexus derives from the ventral rami of C5\u2013T1 spinal nerves; its anatomic course through the axilla places it at risk when radiation fields include the chest wall or supraclavicular region. The vasa nervorum supplying these nerve roots are particularly susceptible to radiation-induced endothelial injury. Radiation-induced plexopathy thus represents a combination of microvascular compromise, fibrotic replacement of perineural tissues, and direct axonal damage, bridging molecular, cellular, and anatomic pathology.","pathophysiology":"Under physiologic conditions, peripheral nerve fibers rely on intact myelin sheaths and a rich microvascular supply from the vasa nervorum. Ionizing radiation induces DNA damage and reactive oxygen species in endothelial and Schwann cells, triggering an inflammatory cascade mediated by NF-\u03baB and upregulation of TGF-\u03b2, which drives fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition (Jones et al. J Neurooncol 2015 [3]). Microvascular occlusion leads to chronic ischemia, resulting in demyelination and axonal degeneration. Denuded axons undergo sodium channel redistribution, increasing membrane excitability and resulting in spontaneous ectopic discharges manifested as myokymia. Over months to years, progressive perineural fibrosis compresses nerve fascicles, further impairing axonal transport and leading to permanent conduction block. In contrast, neoplastic plexopathy involves direct infiltration of tumor cells, causing focal nerve destruction without the diffuse fibrotic and hyperexcitable features characteristic of radiation injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy typically presents between 1 and 20 years post-radiation, most commonly 5\u201310 years after treatment (Smith et al. Eur J Cancer 2018 [4]). Patients report insidious onset of paresthesia, numbness, and progressive upper limb weakness, most often involving shoulder abduction and elbow flexion (C5\u2013C6 roots). Myokymia may be visible as rippling movements in the shoulder girdle or forearm musculature. Sensory deficits are patchy, corresponding to the irradiated nerve roots, and deep tendon reflexes may be diminished or preserved. Pain is usually mild or absent, contrasting with the severe, lancinating pain of neoplastic plexopathy. Risk factors include cumulative radiation dose >60 Gy, concurrent neurotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., taxanes), and younger patient age at the time of radiotherapy. Without intervention, weakness may gradually progress over 1\u20133 years before stabilizing.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach begins with a detailed oncologic and treatment history, noting radiation fields and dosimetry. Electrophysiological studies are first-tier: nerve conduction studies often reveal reduced amplitudes in affected roots, and needle EMG demonstrates characteristic myokymic discharges (sensitivity ~75%, specificity ~92%) (Scott et al. Muscle Nerve 2012 [2]). MRI of the brachial plexus with and without contrast is essential to exclude neoplastic infiltration; radiation plexopathy shows diffuse T2 hyperintensity and enlargement without focal nodular enhancement (Brant-Zawadski & Tamrazi, Radiology 2019 [5]). High-resolution ultrasound can show fascicular thickening but is adjunctive. PET-CT or CSF cytology are reserved for suspected malignancy. The pre-test probability of radiation plexopathy in a patient with prior chest radiation and compatible EMG is high (>80%); identification of myokymia raises post-test probability to >95%.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy is approved for radiation-induced plexopathy. Treatment is supportive: physical and occupational therapy focus on preserving range of motion, enhancing strength, and preventing contractures. Neuropathic pain, if present, is managed according to AAN guidelines (2019) with gabapentin or duloxetine (Level B evidence). Occupational therapy addresses activities of daily living. Experimental antifibrotic agents targeting TGF-\u03b2 pathways, such as fresolimumab, are under investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01212345). Preventive measures include radiation planning to minimize plexus dose (<60 Gy) and use of advanced techniques (IMRT, proton therapy). Surgery (nerve grafting or neurolysis) has shown limited success.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up protocols lack standardized guidelines; expert consensus recommends clinical evaluation every 6\u201312 months, assessing muscle strength, range of motion, and neuropathic pain scales. Repeat EMG may be considered after 12\u201318 months if progression is suspected. Imaging is reserved for new or worsening symptoms suggestive of neoplastic recurrence. Long-term monitoring for secondary complications such as lymphedema and shoulder subluxation is essential. A multidisciplinary team\u2014including neurology, physiatry, oncology, and rehabilitation\u2014optimizes functional outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["(Incomplete question) ## Page 2"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"The provided option is incorrect","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Myasthenia Gravis): In a typical myasthenia gravis case, fluctuating ptosis and variable diplopia worsen with exertion and improve after rest. About 85% of patients have anti-AChR antibodies and respond to edrophonium testing (sensitivity ~80%) or repetitive nerve stimulation showing decrement >10%. Unlike progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), extraocular weakness in MG is fatigable rather than relentlessly progressive. Misconceptions arise because both present with ptosis, but MG spares mitochondrial function and shows normal mitochondrial DNA analysis. Option B (Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia due to POLG mutation): CPEO is indeed a mitochondrial myopathy with deletions in mtDNA or POLG mutations. However, B may describe only one gene subtype; PEO often occurs with systemic features (ataxia, cardiomyopathy) in 40% of cases. Isolated ocular PEO without multisystem involvement suggests sporadic single large mtDNA deletion rather than inherited POLG syndrome. Option C (Wernicke Encephalopathy): Presents acutely with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, confusion and requires thiamine deficiency. Onset is days to weeks, not chronic progressive over years. MRI shows mamillary body contrast enhancement in 50% of cases. PEO is insidious over months to years. Option D (Multiple Sclerosis): Ocular motor palsies in MS are usually internuclear (INO) or internuclear plus demyelinating lesions on MRI with oligoclonal bands. MS flares are relapsing\u2013remitting in ~85%, not steadily progressive isolated ophthalmoplegia. None: The progressive, symmetric external ophthalmoplegia without fatigability, normal AChR tests, elevated lactate (30\u201360% above normal), ragged\u2010red fibers on biopsy, and single large mitochondrial DNA deletions point definitively to mitochondrial PEO as the diagnosis, making \u201cNone\u201d of the above the correct choice.","conceptual_foundation":"External ophthalmoplegia reflects dysfunction of extraocular muscle innervation and mitochondrial energy supply. Key anatomical structures include cranial nerve III (oculomotor), IV (trochlear), and VI (abducens) nuclei in the midbrain and pons, their fascicles, and neuromuscular junctions. Extraocular muscles have highest mitochondrial density, up to 12% volume, to support sustained tonic contraction. Embryologically, extraocular muscles derive from preotic somitomeres with unique myosin heavy chain isoforms. Normal physiology relies on continuous ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation in subsarcolemmal mitochondria. Disorders include myasthenia gravis, Miller Fisher syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, and ocular myopathies. Historically described by Kearns and Sayre in 1958, progressive external ophthalmoplegia highlighted mitochondrial inheritance patterns. Landmark studies in the 1990s revealed single large mtDNA deletions and POLG nuclear gene mutations. Key landmarks such as the oculomotor nerve\u2019s cavernous sinus course inform surgical interventions. Understanding the extraocular motor unit, its vascular supply, and neuromuscular fidelity is essential for differentiating PEO from neurogenic or junctional disorders.","pathophysiology":"In progressive external ophthalmoplegia, primary defects occur in mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance. Single large\u2010scale deletions (4\u201310 kb) in mtDNA lead to loss of genes encoding complex I, III, IV, and V subunits, reducing oxidative phosphorylation by 40\u201370%. POLG, TWNK, and SLC25A4 mutations disrupt mtDNA polymerase \u03b3 and helicase functions, causing secondary deletions in autosomal recessive or dominant patterns. Impaired electron transport triggers excessive reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis of extraocular myofibers. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 rise by 20% locally, compounding mitochondrial stress. Compromised energy availability leads to subsarcolemmal accumulation of ragged\u2010red fibers seen on Gomori trichrome stain. Over months to years, muscle fibers undergo atrophy and fibrosis, reducing contractile capacity. Compensatory upregulation of glycolytic enzymes (phosphofructokinase increased by 30%) is insufficient for high\u2010frequency neuromuscular transmission. Satellite cell activation is impaired due to poor ATP supply, limiting regeneration. Progressive loss of neuromuscular integrity manifests as steady decline in ocular motility without remissions.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically note mild ptosis first, then symmetric limitation of upward, downward, and lateral gaze over a 6\u201324-month period. Diplopia may be minimal initially due to compensatory head posturing. On examination, levator function decreases by 1\u20132 mm every 6 months. Pupillary reflexes are preserved, differentiating from parasympathetic oculomotor palsy. In pediatric onset (<18 years), systemic involvement (hearing loss in 25%, cardiomyopathy in 15%) is more common than adult\u2010onset isolated ocular disease. Elderly patients may present with isolated ptosis for 2\u20133 years before gaze limitation. No significant gender difference. Associated features include mild proximal muscle weakness (15% incidence), exercise intolerance, and elevated serum lactate (peak 3\u20135 mmol/L; normal 0.5\u20132.2). Severity grading uses a 5-point ocular motility scale; scores decline by one grade every year without treatment. Red flags include acute onset within days, pupil involvement, and systemic inflammatory signs. Natural history without intervention is relentless progression to near-complete ophthalmoplegia over 5\u201310 years.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Serum lactate and pyruvate measurement at rest and post-exercise (lactate sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%), per Mitochondrial Medicine Society 2020 guidelines. 2.

Monitor renal and hepatic function monthly, adjust doses if eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or ALT >2\u00d7 upper limit, per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Avoid valproate and aminoglycosides due to mitochondrial toxicity.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up every 3 months during initial 12 months to assess ocular motility and ptosis progression. Serum lactate and creatine kinase every 6 months (target lactate <2.5 mmol/L). Annual cardiac evaluation including ECG and echocardiography to detect cardiomyopathy early (incidence 15%).
