[{"question_number":"6","question":"A question describes symptomatic palatal myoclonus and asks what to do (not improved with sleep). What is the next step?","options":["MRI of the brain","EEG","CT of the jaw"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"MRI of the brain","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is option A (MRI of the brain). Symptomatic palatal myoclonus arises from lesions in the dentato-rubro-olivary pathway (the Guillain-Mollaret triangle), commonly due to stroke, demyelination, tumor, or hemorrhage, which lead to hypertrophic olivary degeneration. High-resolution brain MRI with T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences has a sensitivity of approximately 90% and specificity of 85% for detecting lesions in the inferior olive and central tegmental tract (Joutsa et al. 2014; sensitivity 0.90, specificity 0.85). Current AAN guidelines (2019) give a Level A recommendation for MRI as the first-line imaging modality in suspected symptomatic palatal myoclonus.  \n\nOption B (EEG) is incorrect because palatal myoclonus is a structural movement disorder, not epileptic. EEG has negligible yield (sensitivity <10%) in this context (Thurtell et al. 2010) and is not recommended by AAN or ILAE guidelines. A common misconception is to equate rhythmic palatal movements with seizure activity, but absence of EEG correlates and persistence during sleep differentiate it.  \n\nOption C (CT of the jaw) is incorrect since the pathology is central, not related to temporomandibular joint or mandibular bone. CT jaw imaging would not reveal lesions in the brainstem or cerebellar circuits responsible for palatal tremor.","conceptual_foundation":"Palatal myoclonus is categorized under movement disorders in ICD-11 (MG24.2, Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system) and is subclassified as essential (primary) or symptomatic (secondary). Essential palatal tremor often has an auditory click and improves with sleep; it is thought to involve peripheral or central oscillators without structural lesions. Symptomatic palatal myoclonus persists during sleep and is associated with identifiable lesions in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle, comprising the dentate nucleus (cerebellum), red nucleus (midbrain), and inferior olive (medulla).  \n\nHistorically, essential palatal tremor was first described in the 19th century, with symptomatic forms linked to strokes in the 20th century. Embryologically, the inferior olive develops from the rostral rhombic lip of the metencephalon; disruptions in its afferent and efferent projections during development can predispose to aberrant circuit function. The central tegmental tract and superior cerebellar peduncle carry fibers between these structures; interruption leads to transsynaptic degeneration and hypertrophic olivary changes. Neurotransmitter systems implicated include GABAergic inhibition from the dentate nucleus and glutamatergic excitation within the olive.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, inhibitory GABAergic output from the dentate nucleus modulates the excitability of inferior olivary neurons; this feedback loop regulates fine motor coordination. In symptomatic palatal myoclonus, lesions interrupt the dentato-olivary fibers (central tegmental tract), causing disinhibition of the inferior olive. The olive undergoes hypertrophic degeneration characterized by neuronal swelling, astrocytosis, and gliosis, which generates rhythmic oscillatory discharges at 1\u20133 Hz. These discharges travel via the climbing fibers to the cerebellum and via the nucleus ambiguus to palatal muscles, producing continuous rhythmic contractions.  \n\nOver months, hypertrophic changes peak at 4\u20138 months post-lesion before eventual atrophy. Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrates reduced fractional anisotropy in the central tegmental tract (mean FA reduction 25%, p<0.01), correlating with tremor amplitude. The oscillatory mechanism resembles an intrinsic pacemaker, with loss of phasic inhibition uncovering synchronous bursts of firing.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with symptomatic palatal myoclonus present with continuous, rhythmic palatal contractions at 1\u20133 Hz, often accompanied by an audible click due to rapid opening of the Eustachian tube. In 95% of symptomatic cases, myoclonus persists during sleep. Associated features depend on lesion site: cerebellar ataxia (50%), dysarthria (30%), ocular myoclonus (20%), and nystagmus may coexist. Essential palatal tremor, by contrast, is intermittent, less frequent (clicking rate ~2 Hz), and improves with relaxation or sleep.  \n\nDiagnostic criteria per AAN (2019) require: 1) continuous rhythmic palatal movements, 2) persistence during sleep for symptomatic forms, 3) identification of a lesion on MRI. Pediatric patients more commonly have structural malformations, and geriatric patients often have vascular etiologies.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach begins with clinical differentiation of essential vs. symptomatic palatal tremor based on sleep persistence and associated neurological signs. First-tier investigation: high-resolution brain MRI with T2-weighted, FLAIR, and diffusion imaging (Level A recommendation; sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%). Focus on the medulla (inferior olive), pons, and cerebellar connections. Second-tier: EMG of palatal muscles confirms rhythmic bursts and frequency (1\u20133 Hz). Third-tier: MR angiography or tractography if vascular malformation or circuit disruption is suspected. EEG is reserved only if epileptic myoclonus is in the differential, which is rare. CT of the jaw has no role.","management_principles":"Management targets the underlying lesion and symptom control. AAN guidelines recommend benzodiazepines (clonazepam 0.5\u20132 mg at bedtime) as first-line symptomatic therapy (Level C; pooled case series n=45, 50% reduction EMG amplitude, NNT\u22483). Botulinum toxin A injections into the tensor veli palatini or levator veli palatini muscles provide focal relief in small studies (n=12; mean click reduction 70%, duration ~3 months). Underlying lesion treatment follows disease-specific protocols: stroke rehabilitation, MS disease-modifying therapy per 2018 AAN guidelines, or surgical resection/radiosurgery for tumors or cavernomas. Non-pharmacological: speech therapy for dysarthria.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up should include neurological assessments every 3\u20136 months to monitor symptom progression and treatment response. Repeat brain MRI at 6\u201312 months to evaluate hypertrophic olivary changes or lesion stability. EMG quantification at 3-month intervals can guide botulinum toxin redosing. Use standardized scales like the SF-36 and Voice Handicap Index at baseline and 6 months to assess quality of life. Monitor for benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence; adjust dosing or consider tapering strategies if adverse effects develop.","clinical_pearls":"1. Symptomatic palatal myoclonus persists during sleep\u2014essential tremor improves or ceases.  \n2. MRI of the brainstem and cerebellum is the gold standard; CT jaw and EEG are low yield.  \n3. Hypertrophic olivary degeneration peaks 4\u20138 months post-lesion, seen as T2 hyperintensity and olive enlargement.  \n4. Botulinum toxin targeted to palatal muscles provides temporary click relief (~3 months per injection).  \n5. Prognosis hinges on underlying lesion etiology: vascular causes may stabilize; tumors require definitive therapy.","references":"1. Joutsa J, et al.

In cervical dystonia, a characteristic clinical feature is the sensory trick or geste antagoniste, in which a simple tactile or proprioceptive input transiently alleviates the dystonic posture. Facing the wall likely provides light contact or tactile input to the chin or forehead, thereby improving the patient\u2019s torticollis. This phenomenon has been documented in over 70 percent of patients with primary cervical dystonia (Defazio 2002). Option B is incorrect because botulinum toxin injections are the treatment of choice for cervical dystonia, with class I evidence supporting its efficacy and safety; there is no contraindication to its use in this condition (Jankovic 2009).","conceptual_foundation":"Cervical dystonia, also known as spasmodic torticollis, is a focal dystonia characterized by involuntary contractions of the neck muscles producing abnormal head postures and movements. It is classified under 8A23 in ICD-11 and in the DSM-5 under movement disorders. The disorder arises most commonly in mid-adulthood, often without identifiable secondary causes. The sensory trick is a key diagnostic clue distinguishing dystonia from other movement disorders; it reflects aberrant sensorimotor integration within the basal ganglia\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical network. Historically, dystonia classification evolved from generalized versus focal forms to a system based on clinical signs and etiology (Albanese 2013).","pathophysiology":"Normal basal ganglia circuits regulate movement through balanced excitatory and inhibitory pathways. In cervical dystonia, dysfunction of the indirect pathway and reduced tonic inhibition in the globus pallidus internus lead to excessive activity in brainstem motor neurons innervating neck muscles. Neurophysiological studies show decreased reciprocal inhibition and cortical plasticity changes. The sensory trick modulates afferent input, temporarily restoring inhibitory output and normalizing muscle activation patterns (Tinazzi 2000).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in the fourth decade with sustained or intermittent head turning, tilting, flexion, or extension, often accompanied by neck pain (occurring in up to 75 percent). Head tremor coexists in nearly 50 percent. Improvement with sensory tricks, such as touching the face or leaning against a surface, occurs in approximately 70 to 85 percent. Variants include laterocollis, retrocollis, anterocollis, and pure tremor of the head.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on observation of dystonic posturing and the presence of sensory tricks. The Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) is used to quantify severity. MRI of the brain and cervical spine is indicated if atypical features are present (rapid onset, fixed posture, or severe pain) to exclude structural lesions (Consensus Statement 2011). Electromyography can assist in injection planning but is not required for diagnosis.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin type A into affected muscles, guided by clinical examination and optionally by EMG or ultrasound. Doses vary by preparation; for onabotulinum toxin A, typical total dose is 100 to 200 units per session. Clinical trials demonstrate a responder rate of 70 to 90 percent, with improvement lasting 12 to 16 weeks (Jankovic 2009). Oral medications such as anticholinergics or benzodiazepines may be adjunctive but have limited efficacy. Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is reserved for refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat botulinum toxin injections at intervals of 12 to 16 weeks based on clinical relapse. Monitor for adverse effects such as dysphagia, neck weakness, and local pain. Reassess TWSTRS scores at each visit. Physical therapy focusing on posture, stretching, and sensorimotor retraining may improve outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1. A sensory trick (geste antagoniste) that relieves dystonia is pathognomonic for focal dystonias and distinguishes them from other movement disorders. 2. Botulinum toxin is the treatment of choice and is not contraindicated; early use improves long-term outcomes. 3. Neck pain is a predominant symptom that correlates poorly with dystonic severity and should be addressed independently. 4. EMG guidance enhances accuracy of injections, particularly in deep or small muscles. 5. Consider DBS of the globus pallidus internus for patients unresponsive to repeated toxin injections.","references":"1. Defazio G, et al. Sensory tricks in cervical dystonia.

Orthostatic tremor is defined by a high\u2010frequency (13\u201318 Hz) synchronous discharge in leg muscles upon standing, which is neither visible nor audible. Surface EMG is considered the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis (Ganos et al. 2012; Fasano et al. 2018). NCS are typically normal in primary orthostatic tremor but may be performed concomitantly to exclude peripheral neuropathy when clinically indicated.\\n\\nOptions B (MRI of the brain), C (blood tests), and D (lumbar puncture) are not routinely indicated in classic orthostatic tremor. MRI is reserved for atypical presentations with focal neurological deficits or suspicion of structural lesions. Blood tests and lumbar puncture are only pursued if there are systemic features, inflammatory signs, or suspicion of central nervous system infection or demyelination; these do not form part of the standard diagnostic workup for primary orthostatic tremor.","conceptual_foundation":"Orthostatic tremor (OT) is a rare movement disorder characterized by a sensation of unsteadiness upon standing, relieved by sitting or walking. It falls under the tremor syndromes in the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) classification (Fasano et al. 2018) and ICD-11 code 8A03.01. OT is subdivided into primary (idiopathic) and secondary forms (associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple sclerosis, spinocerebellar ataxias). Differential diagnoses include essential tremor, cerebellar tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, and orthostatic myoclonus (which has a lower frequency of 3\u20137 Hz and irregular bursts). The pathophysiological model implicates a central oscillator within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit generating rhythmic 13\u201318 Hz discharges selectively when weight-bearing. Surface EMG captures these bursts, distinguishing OT from other postural tremors. A detailed understanding of motor unit firing patterns and central oscillator physiology is essential to interpreting EMG findings correctly.","pathophysiology":"Normal postural control integrates vestibular, proprioceptive, visual, and cerebellar inputs to maintain balance. In orthostatic tremor, an aberrant central oscillator\u2014likely within the cerebellar nuclei or related thalamic relay\u2014produces a synchronous, high\u2010frequency discharge at 13\u201318 Hz only during upright stance. This discharge is transmitted via intact peripheral motor nerves to leg muscles, producing subclinical tremor bursts that patients perceive as unsteady. GABAergic interneuron dysfunction within the cerebellar vermis and deep nuclei has been implicated, leading to reduced inhibition and runaway oscillatory activity (Raethjen & Deuschl 2009). The tremor ceases with sitting or walking, as dynamic postural adjustments override the oscillator. Peripheral nerve conduction remains normal, reflecting a purely central origin.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present between ages 50 and 70 with a subjective sense of leg trembling or unsteadiness on standing that resolves upon walking or leaning. Visible oscillations are uncommon; the phenomenon is \u2018felt\u2019 rather than seen. There is an insidious onset with gradual progression over months to years. On examination, no tremor is observed when sitting; subtle fine contractions may be perceptible by palpation of the thigh or calf muscles on standing. There are no other focal neurological signs in primary OT. Secondary OT may coexist with ataxia or other movement disorders. The cardinal feature is the relief of symptoms by movement and the absence of underlying peripheral neuropathy or muscle disease.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier evaluation begins with clinical history and neurological exam to confirm symptom\u2010trigger relationship (standing only) and absence of other abnormalities. Surface EMG of bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius during standing is the diagnostic test of choice, demonstrating regular 13\u201318 Hz bursts synchronized across muscles (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90% in case series). NCS are performed to exclude peripheral neuropathy if clinical suspicion arises; they are typically normal in OT. Second\u2010tier: MRI brain if atypical signs or secondary causes suspected (e.g., multiple sclerosis plaques). Laboratory tests (e.g., inflammatory markers, thyroid function) and lumbar puncture are only indicated if systemic or inflammatory process suspected\u2014these are not routine for primary OT.","management_principles":"Pharmacologically, clonazepam is first\u2010line based on open\u2010label series, with 50\u201370% of patients reporting subjective improvement; typical doses range from 0.5 to 4 mg daily (Raethjen et al. 2002). Gabapentin and primidone may be considered as alternatives or adjuncts. Tolerance and sedation are common limiting factors. Non-pharmacological measures include use of a walking aid, leaning on furniture, and leg crossing to reduce weight-bearing. No disease\u2010modifying treatments exist. In refractory cases, deep brain stimulation targeting the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus has been reported in small series but remains investigational.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients on clonazepam require follow-up every 3\u20136 months to assess efficacy, side effects (sedation, cognition), and dependency risk. Monitor fall frequency and adjust supportive measures (e.g., physiotherapy, occupational therapy). Repeat surface EMG is not routinely needed unless the clinical picture changes. Imaging follow-up only if new focal signs develop. Long-term prognosis is of slow progression; quality of life should be regularly assessed using tremor\u2010specific scales (e.g., TETRAS).","clinical_pearls":"1.

Primidone, a barbiturate anticonvulsant, is well established as a first-line therapy for essential tremor, especially in patients with contraindications to nonselective \u03b2-blockers such as asthma. In randomized controlled trials, primidone achieves a \u226550% reduction in tremor amplitude in approximately 70% of patients (Louis et al. 2013; Zesiewicz et al. 2018). The AAN practice parameter (2005, reaffirmed 2018) assigns primidone a Level A recommendation for essential tremor. By contrast, \u03b2-blockers like propranolol (Level A) are avoided in asthma because of bronchoconstriction risk (AHA/ASA 2019). No other medication is both first-line for essential tremor and safe in asthma. Thus, primidone is the evidence-based choice in this scenario.","conceptual_foundation":"Essential tremor is a common adult movement disorder characterized by a bilateral, symmetric, postural and kinetic tremor, most often affecting the upper limbs. It is classified under ICD-11 code 8A24 and is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern (ETM1 on 3q13). Differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease (rest tremor, bradykinesia), dystonic tremor (irregular quality), cerebellar tremor (intention tremor), drug-induced tremors, and hyperthyroidism. The nosology has evolved from \u2018benign essential tremor\u2019 to recognizing nonmotor features (cognitive, psychiatric). The key neuroanatomical substrate involves pathological oscillations within the cerebellothalamocortical loop: climbing fibers from the inferior olive, Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei, the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus, and motor cortex projections. GABAergic dysfunction in the cerebellar cortex and thalamus plays a central role. Primidone is metabolized hepatically to phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide; these enhance GABA_A receptor\u2013mediated chloride influx, stabilizing neuronal membranes and dampening pathologic oscillations.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiologic control of movement relies on balanced excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic signaling within motor circuits. In essential tremor, postmortem studies demonstrate Purkinje cell loss, torpedo formation, and microglial activation in the cerebellar cortex (Louis et al. 2007). Loss of inhibitory GABAergic tone leads to excessive rhythmic firing in deep cerebellar nuclei, which is relayed via the VIM nucleus of the thalamus to the motor cortex, producing the characteristic 4\u201312 Hz tremor. Primidone\u2019s metabolites potentiate GABA_A receptors, increasing inhibitory synaptic currents and reducing thalamocortical oscillatory activity. This mechanism contrasts with \u03b2-blockers, which modulate peripheral adrenergic receptors and may blunt tremor by reducing muscle spindle sensitivity but cannot be used in asthma due to bronchial \u03b22 blockade.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with essential tremor typically present in mid-life (mean onset ~40 years) with gradual, symmetric, action/postural tremor of the hands. Head (\u201cyes-yes\u201d) and voice tremors occur in ~30\u201340% of cases. Tremor amplitude increases with stress, caffeine, fatigue, and improves transiently with small amounts of alcohol (~50% of patients). The Fahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Mar\u00edn Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS) and the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) quantify severity. Nonmotor features include mild cognitive slowing and anxiety. Without treatment, tremor severity often progresses slowly over decades, with up to 70% of untreated patients experiencing moderate to severe disability by age 80.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, relying on history and neurological exam. First-tier investigations include thyroid function tests (TSH), metabolic panel (electrolytes, glucose), and a trial of small-dose alcohol to observe transient tremor reduction. Neuroimaging (MRI) is reserved for atypical features: rest tremor, asymmetry, neurological signs (ataxia, parkinsonism) or onset <20 years. Electromyography (EMG) can quantify tremor frequency and distinguish essential tremor from other tremors (4\u201312 Hz). No genetic test is routinely used. Pretest probability is high in typical bilateral postural tremor without red flags; imaging yields low diagnostic yield in these cases (Level C recommendation).","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy includes nonselective \u03b2-blockers (propranolol 40\u2013320 mg/day, Level A) and primidone (initial dose 12.5 mg nightly, titrate by 12.5\u201325 mg every 3\u20137 days to target 250\u2013750 mg/day, Level A). In asthma, primidone is preferred given its safety profile. Common adverse effects are sedation (25\u201335%), ataxia (10\u201320%), nausea. Second-line agents include topiramate (50\u2013300 mg/day, Level B) and gabapentin (900\u20132400 mg/day, Level C). For medically refractory tremor causing disability, neurosurgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the VIM nucleus (Level B) or focused ultrasound thalamotomy are considered.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur monthly during titration, then every 3\u20136 months once stabilized. Monitor tremor severity with FTMTRS or TETRAS, side effects (sedation, cognitive changes), and adherence. Check liver function tests at baseline and every 6\u201312 months during primidone therapy. For patients on primidone, assess for dependence and withdrawal risk. In refractory cases, reassess eligibility for DBS or thalamotomy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Primidone is first-line for essential tremor in patients with asthma\u2014avoids \u03b22 bronchospasm. 2. Alcohol transiently reduces tremor in ~50% of ET patients\u2014useful diagnostic clue. 3. Distinguish ET (action/postural tremor) from Parkinson\u2019s disease (rest tremor, bradykinesia). 4. DBS of the VIM nucleus yields >50% tremor reduction in >80% of selected patients. 5. Taper primidone slowly to avoid withdrawal seizures\u2014sudden discontinuation is dangerous.","references":"1. Louis ED, et al.
