[{"question_number":"8","question":"Which of the following is a common complication of cerebral malaria?","options":["Encephalopathy","Seizures","Retinal hemorrhages","All of the above ## Page 18"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"All of the above","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Cerebral malaria is characterized by encephalopathy (impaired consciousness), seizures (common in children and adults), and retinal hemorrhages (a hallmark sign on fundoscopy). All three listed complications are well documented in the literature; thus, option D (\u201cAll of the above\u201d) is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral malaria (ICD-11 code 1A00.4) is defined by unarousable coma in a patient with falciparum parasitemia, excluding other causes. Differential includes viral or bacterial encephalitis, metabolic encephalopathies, and central nervous system vasculitis. The condition was first characterized in the early 20th century, with malarial retinopathy described in the 1990s as a key diagnostic adjunct.","pathophysiology":"Sequestration of P. falciparum\u2013infected erythrocytes in cerebral microvessels leads to BBB disruption through mechanical obstruction and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3). The resultant cytotoxic edema and neuronal dysfunction cause encephalopathy. Seizures arise from focal and generalized cortical irritation and metabolic derangements. Retinal hemorrhages mirror the same microvascular injury in the retinal vasculature.","clinical_manifestation":"Encephalopathy presents as confusion, delirium, stupor, and coma. Seizures occur in 30\u201380% of cases (more common in young children). Retinal hemorrhages are observed in ~15\u201325% of adult patients and up to 50% of pediatric cases. Papilledema may be seen in 10\u201315%. Mortality rate remains 15\u201320% with artesunate treatment.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnosis rests on clinical criteria plus peripheral smear or antigen test for P. falciparum. Fundoscopy for malarial retinopathy has sensitivity ~85% and specificity ~90% in differentiating cerebral malaria from other encephalopathies. EEG may reveal diffuse slowing or epileptiform activity in seizure patients.","management_principles":"Treatment is IV artesunate followed by full course of ACT. Manage seizures with IV benzodiazepines; if refractory, add phenobarbital or phenytoin. Control intracranial pressure with head elevation and hyperosmolar therapy if indicated. Evidence level A from multiple RCTs supports artesunate over quinine.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute management, assess survivors for cognitive impairment, motor deficits, and visual field defects at discharge and periodically for at least 6 months. Rehabilitation services should be engaged for any deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1. Malarial retinopathy is a specific sign\u2014look for hemorrhages and vessel changes. 2. Seizures are common and may be subclinical\u2014consider EEG. 3. Encephalopathy in an endemic area with falciparum parasitemia is cerebral malaria until proven otherwise. 4. IV artesunate reduces mortality more than quinine. 5. Survivors require neurocognitive follow-up.","references":"1. Idro R, Jenkins NE, Newton CR.

What should be done next?","options":["Brain MRI","Brain biopsy","Measles antibody test"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Measles antibody test","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Brain MRI (51 words)\nBrain MRI may reveal white matter changes in SSPE but often is nonspecific early on. In acute demyelinating processes like ADEM, MRI is first-line (per AAN 2023 guidelines). However, in SSPE, MRI changes appear late in only 60% of cases, so MRI alone delays diagnosis and management, making this incorrect.\n\nOption B: Brain biopsy (56 words)\nBrain biopsy provides definitive histology but is invasive with risk of hemorrhage or infection (mortality ~1%) and is reserved for atypical or tumor-like lesions (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2021 guidelines). In classic SSPE with characteristic EEG and clinical features, biopsy is unnecessary and carries unjustified risk, rendering this choice incorrect.\n\nOption C: Measles antibody test (Correct, 62 words)\nMeasles antibody testing in CSF and serum confirms SSPE with sensitivity ~95% and specificity ~90% (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). The pathophysiological basis is persistent mutant measles virus within neurons, eliciting intrathecal antibody production. Elevated CSF IgG measles titers (ratio >1.3) are diagnostic. This test is rapid, minimally invasive, widely available, and guides antiviral therapy, making it definitively correct.\n\nOption D: Serum autoantibody panel (52 words)\nNeural autoantibody panels (e.g., anti-NMDA-R) are used in autoimmune encephalitis (per International Consensus Criteria 2021). However, SSPE is viral, not autoimmune. Autoantibodies are negative in >98% of SSPE cases. Ordering this panel delays appropriate testing for measles antibodies, increasing morbidity and is therefore incorrect.\n\nCommon Misconceptions:\nMany choose MRI first due to overreliance on imaging; however, bioserology is more sensitive. Brain biopsy is a \"gold standard\" in pathology but unnecessary here. Autoantibody panels are popular but irrelevant to viral etiologies.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical Structures and Pathways (48 words)\nSSPE primarily involves cortical gray matter, subcortical white matter, basal ganglia (especially caudate nucleus), and mesencephalic reticular formation. Viral particles accumulate in perikarya and oligodendrocytes, leading to neuronal dysfunction. The periodic complexes on EEG originate from widespread cortical involvement.\n\nEmbryology and Development (36 words)\nMeasles virus crosses the immature blood\u2013brain barrier in early childhood. The developing neuronal synaptogenesis phase (6\u201324 months) is most vulnerable, leading to late SSPE emergence 6\u201310 years post-infection.\n\nNormal Physiology and Regulation (42 words)\nCortical neurons regulate excitatory glutamatergic transmission and inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. Measles disrupts this balance, causing neuronal hyperexcitability and periodic discharges. Astrocytes and microglia maintain homeostasis; their activation in SSPE contributes to inflammation.\n\nRelated Syndromes and Historical Perspective (44 words)\nSSPE was first described by Dawson in 1933. Similar to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and subacute necrotizing encephalitis, it involves viral persistence. Recognition of periodic EEG complexes by Gibbs and Gibbs in 1952 laid the foundation for noninvasive diagnosis. Key landmarks include the periventricular white matter and cortical ribbon.","pathophysiology":"Molecular Mechanisms (35 words)\nSSPE arises from mutated measles virus lacking the matrix (M) protein, impairing viral assembly but allowing persistent infection. Viral fusion (F) protein mediates cell\u2013cell spread via syncytia without budding, evading neutralizing antibodies.\n\nCellular and Immune Responses (38 words)\nInfected neurons and oligodendrocytes trigger intrathecal IgG synthesis. Activated microglia release TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3, causing bystander neuronal injury. CD8+ T cells infiltrate perivascular spaces but fail to clear the virus due to poor antigen presentation.\n\nGenetics and Inheritance (36 words)\nAlthough not inherited, host polymorphisms in HLA-DQB1 and IFNAR1 genes influence susceptibility. Affected children often lack neutralizing antibody response after primary infection. Familial clustering (<5%) suggests polygenic risk.\n\nMetabolic and Energy Factors (30 words)\nPersistent infection increases metabolic demand. Mitochondrial dysfunction from reactive oxygen species impairs ATP production. Neurons compensate by upregulating glycolytic enzymes, but this is insufficient, leading to progressive degeneration.\n\nTime Course and Compensatory Mechanisms (31 words)\nSSPE evolves over 1\u20133 years. Initial synaptic remodeling delays symptoms. As neuronal loss exceeds 30%, clinical signs appear. Compensatory sprouting fails by late stage, resulting in rapid cognitive and motor decline.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom Timeline (40 words)\nSSPE onset is subacute over weeks to months. Phase I: personality changes, cognitive decline. Phase II (6\u201312 months): myoclonic jerks, seizures, visual disturbances. Phase III: spasticity, decerebrate rigidity. Phase IV: vegetative state, autonomic dysfunction, often fatal within 1\u20133 years without treatment.\n\nNeurological Examination (36 words)\nEarly: apathy, ataxia, mild aphasia. Mid-stage: stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, choreoathetoid movements, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses. Late: quadriplegia, cortical blindness, bulbar palsy, respiratory compromise.\n\nAge and Gender Variations (33 words)\nPeak incidence at 5\u201315 years; rare adult-onset cases present with dementia and psychiatric features. Male-to-female ratio ~2:1. Adults often have slower progression over 3\u20135 years.\n\nSystemic and Severity Scales (30 words)\nFever absent in most. Eye involvement includes optic atrophy in 30%. Jabbour SSPE staging quantifies severity (Stage I\u2013IV), correlating with survival: 1-year mortality 80% at Stage III\u2013IV.\n\nNatural History (31 words)\nWithout therapy, mean survival ~1.5 years.

Misconceptions arise when nonviral etiologies are overemphasized without serologic or PCR confirmation [1\u20133].","conceptual_foundation":"Polyradiculopathy refers to pathology of multiple nerve roots, classified under ICD-11 code 8A61. Differential includes viral (CMV, VZV), bacterial (TB, Lyme), paraneoplastic, and autoimmune causes (GBS). Since CMV is ubiquitous and neurotropic, it remains the commonest identified viral agent in root syndromes [4].","pathophysiology":"CMV infects dorsal root ganglia and nerve roots, causing demyelination and axonal injury via direct cytopathic effect and immune-mediated inflammation. In HIV, profound CD4 depletion permits unchecked viral replication. TB involves granulomatous inflammation of meninges, causing root compression rather than direct infection [5].","clinical_manifestation":"CMV polyradiculopathy presents with subacute symmetrical lower limb weakness, areflexia, and sensory loss, often with concomitant CMV viremia, fever, and malaise.
