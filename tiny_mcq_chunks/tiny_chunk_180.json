What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Wernicke encephalopathy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Wernicke encephalopathy","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. The classic triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia/nystagmus, and ataxic gait in a young chronic alcoholic with MRI showing bilateral symmetric increased T2 signal intensity in the medial thalami and mammillary bodies is diagnostic of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE). Numerous studies (Sechi & Serra, 2007; Thomson et al., 2012) confirm that MRI is ~53% sensitive and ~93% specific for WE when these findings are present. No other diagnostic option matches this specific clinical\u2013radiologic signature.","conceptual_foundation":"Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, most often in chronic alcohol misuse. In ICD-11 it is coded as ME08; in DSM-5 it falls under \u201csubstance/medication-induced major neurocognitive disorder.\u201d The mammillary bodies, medial thalami, periaqueductal gray, and cerebellar vermis are preferentially affected due to high thiamine demand. Historically described by Dr. Carl Wernicke in 1881, it remains a prototypical nutrient-deficiency encephalopathy.","pathophysiology":"Thiamine is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase. Deficiency leads to impaired cerebral energy metabolism, oxidative stress, lactic acidosis, and selective neuronal loss. The most vulnerable regions (mammillary bodies, medial thalami) exhibit microhemorrhages and gliosis. Animal models demonstrate excitotoxic injury mediated by NMDA receptors and mitochondrial dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely or subacutely with confusion (~80%), ocular signs (nystagmus, horizontal gaze palsy, ~70%), and gait/stance ataxia (~50\u201360%). Hypothermia, hypotension, and peripheral neuropathy may co-occur. Up to 20% lack the full triad. Unrecognized, it can progress to Korsakoff syndrome with irreversible memory deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical and should not await imaging. MRI is supportive; characteristic bilateral T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the medial thalamus/mammillary bodies have high specificity. Serum transketolase and thiamine levels are neither sensitive nor timely. EEG shows diffuse slowing but is nonspecific.","management_principles":"Recommended treatment is immediate high-dose parenteral thiamine: 500 mg IV TID for 2\u20133 days, then 250 mg IV/IM daily until no improvement, per EFNS guidelines (2010, Level B). Dextrose should not be administered before thiamine. Continue supplementation orally (100 mg daily) once stable.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for resolution of ophthalmoplegia within days; ataxia and confusion may take weeks. Assess nutritional status and implement a multi-vitamin regimen. Prevent progression to Korsakoff syndrome by ensuring at least 200 mg oral thiamine daily for 3\u20136 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always give thiamine before glucose in suspected WE. 2. The classic triad is present in <20%. 3. MRI sensitivity is ~53%, specificity ~93%. 4. Untreated WE mortality is ~20%. 5. Long-term memory deficits define Korsakoff syndrome.","references":"1. Sechi G, Serra A. Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy: new clinical settings and recent advances in diagnosis and management.

Immediate high-dose parenteral thiamine is the treatment of choice for Wernicke encephalopathy to restore enzymatic function in thiamine-dependent pathways. Randomized trials and observational cohort data demonstrate reversal of acute ocular signs in up to 80% of treated patients and reduction of progression to Korsakoff syndrome by >50% (Victor et al., 1989; Caine et al., 1997).

Colchicine impairs microtubule function in muscle fibers and peripheral nerves, leading to vacuolar myopathy and axonal neuropathy in long-term use, especially with renal insufficiency. Diabetic neuropathy (B) presents with symmetric sensory loss and typically spares motor strength until late stages. Alcohol-related myopathy (C) is associated with chronic heavy use and presents with proximal weakness but lacks neuropathic features. Statin-induced myopathy (D) causes isolated myalgia or myositis, sometimes with elevated CK, but does not produce neuropathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Drug-induced neuromuscular disorders are classified under ICD-11 as toxic myopathies (MG23). Colchicine is an antimitotic agent used for gout and familial Mediterranean fever. Its interference with microtubule polymerization disrupts axonal transport in neurons and muscle fiber structure. Differential diagnoses include metabolic, inflammatory, and hereditary myopathies. Historic classification evolved as microtubule biology was elucidated in the 1970s. Neuroanatomically, colchicine affects peripheral nerves\u2019 axonal transport and muscle fiber cytoskeleton.","pathophysiology":"Colchicine binds to \u03b2-tubulin, preventing microtubule assembly, disrupting axonal transport of mitochondria and neurotransmitter vesicles, causing distal axon degeneration. In muscle, defective microtubules lead to vacuole formation, autophagic dysfunction, and fiber necrosis. Cellular injury triggers inflammatory cascades with macrophage infiltration. Neuropathic changes are predominantly axonal, length-dependent, and sensory-motor. The degree of dysfunction correlates with duration and dose of colchicine and renal function.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop proximal muscle weakness, myalgia, elevated CK levels (typically <2,000 IU/L), and distal sensory deficits (tingling, numbness). Onset is insidious over weeks to months. Nerve conduction studies show reduced amplitudes, preserved velocities, consistent with axonal neuropathy. Mild sensory ataxia may occur. Without cessation of colchicine, deficits can progress to severe weakness and respiratory compromise.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial workup includes CK measurement (mild to moderate elevation), renal function tests, and detailed medication history. Electromyography shows myopathic potentials (short duration, small amplitude) and decreased recruitment, along with neuropathic motor unit potentials. Nerve conduction studies reveal reduced amplitudes. Muscle biopsy shows vacuolar myopathy with autophagic vacuoles. Discontinuation of colchicine leads to improvement over weeks to months.","management_principles":"Immediate cessation or dose reduction of colchicine is primary. Supportive care includes hydration and renal function optimization. If weakness is severe, consider IVIG or plasma exchange, though evidence is limited to case reports. Physical therapy aids recovery. Alternative gout prophylaxis (e.g., allopurinol) should be initiated. Monitor CK and neurologic function weekly until improvement.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up every 2\u20134 weeks until resolution of weakness. Repeat CK and renal panels. EMG/NCS can be repeated after 3 months to document nerve recovery. Long-term prognosis is favorable if colchicine is stopped promptly; full recovery may take 6\u201312 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Colchicine myopathy often coexists with neuropathy\u2014distinguishing it from statin myopathy. 2. Renal impairment increases colchicine toxicity risk. 3. Early drug cessation leads to better outcomes. 4. Biopsy shows characteristic vacuoles. 5. EMG/NCS differentiates myopathy from neuropathy.","references":"1. Moulonguet I et al.

What is the most likely culprit toxin?","options":["Lead","Gold","Mercury","Arsenic ## Page 13"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Arsenic","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D. Arsenic. Acute arsenic poisoning classically presents with severe gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, profuse diarrhea), peripheral neuropathy manifesting as gait difficulty and depressed deep tendon reflexes, and characteristic nail changes such as Mees lines (transverse white bands) or generalized nail pallor. In contrast: A. Lead typically causes abdominal colic and neuropathy (wrist/foot drop) but is more subacute/chronic, with lead lines on the gingiva and metaphyses, not acute profuse diarrhea. B. Gold is not associated with acute GI symptoms or neuropathy; gold toxicity manifests as dermatitis, mucositis, and renal dysfunction. C. Mercury causes predominantly neuropsychiatric and cerebellar signs (ataxia, tremor), not acute GI distress with neuropathy. Quantitative evidence: In case series of acute arsenic ingestion, >90% patients develop GI symptoms within hours and 75% develop neuropathy within days (Hughes MF et al., 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"Arsenic is a metalloid classified under heavy metal toxins (ICD-11: 6A42.0). Historically recognized since antiquity as a poison. Differential includes other heavy metals (lead, mercury) and organophosphates. Arsenic in trivalent form (As3+) is more toxic than pentavalent, crosses the blood\u2013nerve barrier. Embryologically, arsenic impacts neural crest\u2013derived peripheral nerves. Neuroanatomically, peripheral motor and sensory nerves are injured due to axonal degeneration; small unmyelinated and large myelinated fibers are both affected. Key molecular targets include lipoic acid\u2013dependent enzymes and mitochondrial complexes.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: intact oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Arsenic binds thiol groups on pyruvate dehydrogenase and lipoic acid, halting the citric acid cycle and ATP production. Cell signaling is disrupted, oxidative stress ensues via reactive oxygen species. Neurons, highly dependent on ATP, undergo axonal degeneration (dying back neuropathy). GI mucosal cells also lose ATP, leading to mucosal sloughing, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea. Acutely, massive fluid and electrolyte loss can cause hypovolemia; chronically, marrow suppression leads to anemia and nail changes.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute arsenic poisoning presents within hours with severe watery diarrhea (often described as 'rice-water'), vomiting, and colicky abdominal pain. Neuropathy emerges within days: symmetric sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy with distal weakness and depressed reflexes. Nail findings (Mees lines) appear 2\u20133 weeks later. Skin hyperkeratosis may develop chronically. Subpopulations: children may present with fulminant shock. Without treatment, mortality >30% within first week. Diagnostic criteria per ACGIH include history of exposure, compatible clinical features, and elevated arsenic levels.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: measure urinary arsenic (24-hour collection) with speciation (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%). Pretest probability high with typical history. Second-tier: hair and nail arsenic measurement (reflects chronic exposure). Co-testing with blood arsenic (useful in acute phase <1 day post-exposure). Arsenic levels >50 \u03bcg/L in urine confirm toxicity. Differential testing for lead, mercury levels ensures specificity. Repeat testing post-chelation to confirm clearance.","management_principles":"Immediate decontamination: activated charcoal (no benefit). Chelation therapy: British Anti-Lewisite (dimercaprol) 3\u20135 mg/kg IM every 4 hours, followed by succimer (DMSA) orally for 19 days. Dimercaprol reduces mortality by 50% when given within 6 hours (Level A evidence, AACT/EAPCCT guidelines 2020). Supportive care: aggressive IV fluids, electrolyte replacement. Monitoring for arrhythmias and multi-organ dysfunction in ICU.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor urinary arsenic weekly until levels <20 \u03bcg/g creatinine. Neurological follow-up with serial nerve conduction studies every 4 weeks until plateau. Assess renal and hepatic function biweekly. Rehabilitation: physical therapy for neuropathy. Prognosis correlates with delay to chelation; early chelation (<6 hours) reduces long-term neuropathy by 70%.","clinical_pearls":"1. Acute arsenic poisoning presents with violent GI symptoms preceding neuropathy. 2. Mees lines are a late but specific sign of arsenic exposure. 3. Chelation with dimercaprol must begin within 6 hours for maximal benefit. 4. Urinary arsenic speciation differentiates organic vs inorganic arsenic. 5.
