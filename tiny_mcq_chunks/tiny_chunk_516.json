[{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) started on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) but lost follow-up. Upon return, the patient had a platelet count of 30 and a skin issue. Which DMT was the patient on?","options":["Alemtuzumab","Teriflunomide"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Alemtuzumab","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, leading to robust depletion of both T and B lymphocytes with repopulation over months. In pivotal trials (CARE-MS I and II), alemtuzumab reduced annualized relapse rate by approximately 55\u201349% compared to interferon beta-1a [1,2]. A known serious adverse event is immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), occurring in 1\u20133% of treated patients, typically with onset a median of 10.5 months after initial infusion [3]. Platelet counts can fall below 30\u00d710^9/L, as in the presented case. Alemtuzumab also frequently causes secondary autoimmunity affecting the skin, including alopecia areata, vitiligo, and other dermatoses in up to 10\u201315% of patients [4].\n\nTeriflunomide, by contrast, is a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor that reduces lymphocyte proliferation but does not induce profound lymphopenia or autoimmunity. Adverse effects include hepatotoxicity (ALT elevations in ~15%), hair thinning (~13%), and gastrointestinal symptoms, but the incidence of severe thrombocytopenia (<50\u00d710^9/L) is <0.2%, and autoimmune skin reactions are rare [6,7]. No substantial risk of ITP or skin autoimmunity exists with teriflunomide. Therefore, the constellation of severe thrombocytopenia and a skin issue strongly implicates alemtuzumab rather than teriflunomide.\n\nA common misconception is attributing infusion-related rash to teriflunomide; however, alemtuzumab\u2019s autoimmune-mediated dermatologic events arise weeks to months post-treatment. Current AAN guidelines recommend monthly CBC monitoring for 48 months following alemtuzumab due to ITP risk [5], whereas such monitoring is not required for teriflunomide.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is classified in ICD-11 under code 8A40.1 (relapsing-remitting MS, RRMS) and is characterized by episodes of focal CNS demyelination with partial or full recovery. Nosologically, RRMS is distinguished from primary progressive and secondary progressive forms by the presence of relapses separated by remissions. The 2017 McDonald criteria integrate MRI dissemination in space and time with clinical features to establish a diagnosis [13].\n\nPathologically, MS lesions involve perivenular inflammatory infiltrates composed of autoreactive CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, macrophages, and microglia that mediate demyelination and axonal damage. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from ventral neural tube precursors regulated by Olig1/2 transcription factors. Autoimmune cells breach the blood\u2013brain barrier via VLA-4 interactions with VCAM-1 and chemokine receptor\u2013ligand gradients (CCR5, CCR6) [10].\n\nDisease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS are categorized into immunomodulators (interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (fingolimod, ozanimod), and lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibodies (alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab). Alemtuzumab is a type I anti-CD52 IgG1\u03ba antibody causing complement-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, producing rapid lymphocyte depletion with distinct repopulation favoring regulatory subsets [15]. Teriflunomide is a reversible DHODH inhibitor that impairs de novo pyrimidine synthesis and preferentially limits proliferation of activated lymphocytes without inducing profound lymphopenia.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, CD52 is broadly expressed on mature lymphocytes and a subset of innate immune cells. Alemtuzumab binding initiates complement activation and engages Fc\u03b3 receptors on effector cells, resulting in targeted lysis of CD52+ lymphocytes [1,15]. Post-depletion, lymphocyte repopulation occurs via homeostatic proliferation and bone marrow activation over 6\u201312 months. However, this can be dysregulated, with early emergence of autoreactive B-cell clones before sufficient regulatory T-cell recovery, predisposing to secondary autoimmunity including ITP and thyroid disorders [11].\n\nIn alemtuzumab-associated ITP, anti-platelet glycoprotein autoantibodies (e.g., anti-GPIIb/IIIa) promote opsonization and splenic clearance of platelets, with platelet destruction outpacing megakaryocyte output. The clinical threshold for spontaneous bleeding is often when platelets drop below 30\u00d710^9/L. Cutaneous autoimmune manifestations (alopecia, vitiligo) reflect similar breakdowns in peripheral tolerance, with lymphocyte-mediated targeting of melanocytes or hair follicle antigens [4].\n\nTeriflunomide\u2019s blockade of DHODH reduces pyrimidine availability in rapidly dividing lymphocytes, thereby attenuating CNS infiltration and inflammation without provoking lymphocyte lysis or autoantibody production, explaining its lower risk of cytopenias or secondary autoimmunity.","clinical_manifestation":"Alemtuzumab infusion reactions occur in ~90% of patients, presenting acutely with fever, headache, rash, and nausea, usually managed with prem\u200bedication (acetaminophen, antihistamines, steroids). Secondary autoimmunity emerges months to years later: ITP occurs in 1\u20133% of patients with median onset at 10.5 months after treatment, presenting with mucocutaneous bleeding, petechiae, and bruising when platelet counts fall below 30\u00d710^9/L [3]. Dermatologic manifestations such as alopecia areata (5\u201310%) and vitiligo (1\u20135%) typically arise within 12\u201336 months and can be progressive if untreated [4].\n\nTeriflunomide\u2019s adverse profile includes hair thinning (~13%), mild rash (~5%), gastrointestinal upset, and hepatotoxicity (ALT elevations in ~15%), but it does not cause severe thrombocytopenia or frank autoimmune cytopenias. Routine dermatologic concerns are limited to nonspecific rash without autoimmune pathogenesis.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation of suspected alemtuzumab-associated ITP begins with a complete blood count confirming isolated thrombocytopenia and peripheral smear to exclude platelet clumping or pseudothrombocytopenia. Anti-platelet antibody assays (e.g., anti-GPIIb/IIIa) have sensitivity ~60% and specificity ~90% [12]. Bone marrow biopsy is reserved for atypical or refractory cases. Skin biopsy with histopathology and immunofluorescence may elucidate autoimmune dermatoses if presentation is unclear.\n\nThe AAN recommends monthly CBC monitoring for 48 months post-alemtuzumab infusion to detect early ITP [5]. In contrast, teriflunomide monitoring includes baseline CBC and LFTs, followed by assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months, without need for monthly platelet counts [7]. Pretest probability of alemtuzumab-ITP (~2%) supports the monthly monitoring strategy, with a low number needed to test to identify one case. In resource-limited settings, patient education on bleeding signs can complement laboratory screening.","management_principles":"Alemtuzumab-associated ITP is managed per primary ITP guidelines: first-line high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1\u20132 mg/kg/day) or IVIG (1 g/kg for one to two days), achieving initial responses in 70\u201380% of cases [12]. Refractory ITP may warrant rituximab (anti-CD20) infusions or splenectomy, with rituximab response rates of 60\u201370% [11]. Alemtuzumab re-dosing should be withheld until ITP resolution and platelet counts stabilize. Skin autoimmunity (alopecia, vitiligo) may be managed with topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or phototherapy; severe or extensive disease can require systemic immunosuppression.\n\nTeriflunomide-related adverse events are managed by dose interruption or discontinuation, with cholestyramine washout protocols recommended for rapid drug elimination in pregnancy planning or toxicity scenarios. The absence of profound cytopenias simplifies its management compared to lymphocyte-depleting therapies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-alemtuzumab follow-up mandates monthly CBC, creatinine, urinalysis, and thyroid function testing for 48 months after the last infusion to detect ITP, nephropathies, and thyroid autoimmunity [5]. Dermatology evaluations every six months facilitate early recognition of skin autoimmunity. In patients who develop ITP, once platelet counts exceed 100\u00d710^9/L for one month, monitoring may be extended to every 3 months for an additional year.\n\nTeriflunomide monitoring consists of LFTs and CBC at 3-month intervals during the first year and annually thereafter [7]. Education on bleeding risk and skin changes is integral to both treatment plans, with prompt reporting of new symptoms to guide timely intervention.","clinical_pearls":"1. Alemtuzumab carries a 1\u20133% risk of immune thrombocytopenia, with median onset ~10.5 months post-infusion\u2014mandating monthly CBC for 48 months.\n2. Teriflunomide does not induce profound lymphopenia or autoimmune cytopenias, distinguishing its safety profile from depleting antibodies.\n3. Secondary autoimmunity after alemtuzumab often targets multiple systems (thyroid ~40%, platelets ~2%, skin ~10%), reflecting dysregulated lymphocyte reconstitution.\n4. Initial ITP management mirrors primary ITP: corticosteroids and IVIG first-line; second-line options include rituximab or splenectomy for refractory cases.\n5. Monitoring protocols differ markedly: monthly hematologic surveillance is essential after alemtuzumab, whereas teriflunomide requires only periodic LFT and CBC checks. These key points underscore drug-specific adverse event profiles and monitoring strategies.","references":"1. Coles AJ, Cohen JA, Fox EJ, et al.

In NMO, optic neuritis occurs in 80\u201390% of cases and often bilaterally with severe visual loss reaching nadir within 5\u20137 days. Up to 30% of first attacks present with painful eye movement and central scotoma. A landmark 2015 multicenter study (Wingerchuk et al.) reported that optic neuritis was the initial manifestation in 45% of seropositive patients. Pathophysiologically, anti\u2013aquaporin-4 antibodies target astrocyte endfeet in the optic nerve, leading to complement-mediated demyelination. Misconception: optic neuritis in MS is typically unilateral and milder, while NMO often features bilateral simultaneous involvement and worse recovery. Option B (Transverse myelitis): Incorrect as an isolated finding. Although longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) spanning \u22653 vertebral segments is characteristic in 70\u201380% of NMO relapses, by itself it lacks specificity. LETM also appears in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 10\u201315% of cases. Option C (Brainstem syndrome): Incorrect as a cardinal feature. Area postrema syndrome with intractable hiccups, nausea or vomiting occurs in ~10\u201330% of NMO patients but is less common. Differential includes Wernicke encephalopathy (thiamine deficiency) and vertebrobasilar stroke. Option D (Cognitive impairment): Rare in NMO. Cognitive dysfunction appears in \u22645% of patients, often secondary to repeated attacks or steroid toxicity. In contrast, cognitive changes are more prominent in MS (up to 65% over 5 years). Thus, optic neuritis remains the defining first-line clue to suspected NMO.","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromyelitis Optica principally involves the optic nerves and spinal cord. The optic nerve comprises retinal ganglion cell axons ensheathed by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, which express aquaporin-4 water channels at endfeet adjacent to blood vessels. Spinal cord involvement is typically longitudinally extensive, defined as lesions spanning three or more vertebral segments, mediated by astrocytic injury in perivascular regions. Embryologically, both optic nerves and spinal cord white matter derive from neuroectodermal precursors of the neural tube, whereas astrocytes differentiate from radial glial cells under transcription factors NFIA and Sox9. Normally, aquaporin-4 regulates water flux across the blood\u2013brain barrier and participates in potassium buffering. NMO overlaps clinically with multiple sclerosis and MOG-antibody disease but is historically distinguished since 1894 when Eug\u00e8ne Devic first described simultaneous optic neuritis and myelitis. The modern aquaporin-4 antibody assay was introduced in 2004, revolutionizing diagnostic specificity to >75% with 85\u201395% specificity. Key landmarks include the periependymal regions of the third and fourth ventricles, area postrema on the dorsal medulla, and optic chiasm\u2014sites enriched in AQP4, explaining focal lesion distribution and clinical correlates such as hiccups and vomiting in area postrema syndrome.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, NMO is mediated by pathogenic immunoglobulin G1 autoantibodies directed against aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG), triggering complement activation via C1q binding and membrane attack complex formation. Astrocyte endfeet bearing AQP4 clusters undergo cytotoxicity, releasing glutamate and disrupting excitatory neurotransmission. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) upregulation fosters B-cell differentiation into plasmablasts secreting AQP4-IgG; CSF IL-6 levels often exceed 10 pg/mL during acute attacks. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DRB1*03:01 in 30% of Caucasian patients and HLA-DPB1*05:01 in 25% of Asian cohorts. Blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown via matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) occurs within 24\u201348 hours of onset. Oligodendrocyte apoptosis follows, with myelin basic protein (MBP) release peaking by day 7. Compensatory astrocyte proliferation around lesion margins is insufficient to restore water channel function. The time course from antibody binding to demyelination spans 3\u201310 days; subsequent remyelination is limited, contributing to accrual of disability. MOG-antibody positive phenotypes show distinct IgG isotypes (IgG1, IgG3) but lack AQP4-targeted astrocytopathy, underscoring divergent cellular immune responses.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in NMO is typically acute to subacute, developing over 24\u201372 hours and peaking in 5\u20137 days. Initial optic neuritis presents with unilateral or bilateral vision loss (20/200 or worse in 65% of acute cases), color desaturation, pain exacerbated by eye movement, and relative afferent pupillary defect. Spinal cord involvement manifests as transverse myelitis: bilateral motor weakness (median Medical Research Council score 2/5), sensory level often at T4\u2013T6, and sphincter dysfunction in 85% of attacks. Pediatric cases under age 18 average relapses every 12 months, whereas adults relapse every 9 months without treatment. Females represent 75% of NMO population, with a female-to-male ratio of 9:1 in seropositive disease. Elderly onset over 60 years is atypical (5% of cases) and correlates with higher in-hospital mortality (15% vs. 3% in younger cohorts). Systemic features such as rheumatoid arthritis may co-occur in 10%. Severity scales include the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) with median score of 6.5 at 5 years if untreated. Red flags: bilateral vision loss, area postrema syndrome (refractory vomiting), LETM on MRI. Without immunotherapy, accrual of two attacks yields permanent disability in 50% by year 3.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion in optic neuritis plus LETM or area postrema syndrome. Step 2: Serum AQP4-IgG assay (cell-based assay sensitivity 75\u201380%, specificity 85\u201395%). If negative but high suspicion, test for MOG-IgG (sensitivity 35\u201350%). Step 3: MRI brain and spine using sagittal and axial T1, T2, FLAIR, and gadolinium-enhanced sequences. Typical spinal lesions span \u22653 vertebral segments in 70% of cases; brain lesions localize to diencephalon or periependymal surfaces in 30%. Step 4: CSF analysis: pleocytosis (median WBC 50 cells/\u00b5L, neutrophilic predominance), protein elevated 75\u2013100 mg/dL, oligoclonal bands negative in 80%. Step 5: Exclude mimics: antinuclear antibody panel, B12 level, syphilis serology, HIV, ACE, chest CT for sarcoidosis. Evoked potentials reveal delayed visual evoked potential P100 latency >120 ms in 60%. Diagnosis requires at least one core clinical characteristic plus supportive serology or imaging findings per 2015 IPND criteria.","management_principles":"Acute attack: First-line intravenous methylprednisolone at 1,000 mg/day for 5 consecutive days, followed by oral prednisone taper starting at 1 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. In steroid-refractory cases at day 7, initiate plasma exchange (PLEX) 5\u20137 sessions, 1.0\u20131.5 plasma volumes/session, every other day. Maintenance therapy: Rituximab at 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks or 1,000 mg on days 1 and 15, with CD19+ B-cell count target <0.01\u00d7109/L; infusions repeated every 6 months. Alternative: Eculizumab 900 mg IV weekly \u00d74 then 1,200 mg every 2 weeks reduces relapse rate by 94% in AQP4+ patients. Azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day or mycophenolate mofetil 1,000\u20132,000 mg BID are third-line. Monitor CBC, liver transaminases monthly. Avoid interferon-beta due to paradoxical exacerbation. Pregnancy: use tacrolimus or azathioprine; discontinue rituximab 6 months prior to conception. Ensure vaccination against encapsulated organisms before eculizumab. Screen for hepatitis B/C prior to rituximab.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3 months in the first year, then every 6 months if stable. Clinical monitoring: EDSS score target improvement by \u22651 point/year. Serum AQP4-IgG titers measured quarterly; rising titers predict relapse with 80% positive predictive value. MRI surveillance: brain and cervical spine annually with T1, T2, FLAIR, and gadolinium; new lesions indicate subclinical activity. Laboratory: CBC, LFTs, immunoglobulin levels every 3 months. Long-term complications include osteoporosis from steroids (incidence 30% at 5 years) and hypogammaglobulinemia from rituximab (10% risk). Prognosis: 1-year relapse-free survival 70% on therapy, 5-year disability-free survival 60%. Rehabilitation timelines: begin physical and occupational therapy within 2 weeks of acute attack.

It binds Purkinje cell antigens CDR2 and CDR2L, leading to subacute pancerebellar syndrome, gait ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus without myoclonus. Approximately 15% of anti-Yo patients may have mild ocular flutter, but not true opsoclonus myoclonus. \n\nOption C (anti-Hu/ANNA-1): Anti-Hu occurs in small cell lung cancer (~16% of paraneoplastic syndromes) and produces sensory neuronopathy, encephalomyelitis, and limbic dysfunction. A minority (<5%) may present with coarse nystagmus secondary to brainstem involvement but not true opsoclonus. Anti-Hu binds neuronal nuclei antigen leading to widespread neurodegeneration, but the clinical picture lacks myoclonic jerks. \n\nOption D (anti-Ma2/Ta): Anti-Ma2 is linked to testicular and lung cancers, causing limbic, diencephalic, and brainstem encephalitis in young men. Eye movement abnormalities can include vertical gaze palsy or skew deviation but not the multidirectional saccadic countenance of opsoclonus. Prevalence in paraneoplastic OMS is under 1%, making it an unlikely etiology. \n\nAnti-Ri (Option A) remains definitive based on pathophysiology, epidemiology, and ophthalmologic findings in breast cancer patients with OMS. Misreading nystagmus as simple cerebellar signs often leads to anti-Yo confusion, but the distinctive irregular, chaotic, high-frequency saccades are pathognomonic for anti-Ri association.","conceptual_foundation":"Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) implicates key anatomical structures regulating saccadic eye movements and motor coordination. The omnipause neurons in the nucleus raphe interpositus of the pontine tegmentum tonically inhibit burst neurons; their loss leads to uncontrolled saccadic bursts. The paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) integrates excitatory burst neuron signals for horizontal saccades, while the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) orchestrates vertical saccades. The cerebellar fastigial nucleus and flocculus modulate saccade accuracy via GABAergic Purkinje cell output; autoimmune targeting here disrupts feedback loops. Embryologically, pontine and cerebellar structures originate from rhombomeres 1\u20133 of the hindbrain, containing progenitors expressing homeobox genes En1 and En2 essential for synaptic patterning. Normal physiological saccade generation involves precise timing of excitatory inputs, inhibition of antagonistic muscles, and rapid cessation by omnipause neurons. OMS shares mechanisms with other brainstem-cerebellar disorders like Miller Fisher syndrome and Wernicke encephalopathy but is distinguished by chaotic, multidirectional saccades without intersaccadic intervals. Historically first described by Kinsbourne in 1962 as \u201cdancing eyes,\u201d subsequent immunohistochemical studies in the 1980s identified anti-Ri antibodies as central mediators. Key landmarks include the pontine tegmentum, cerebellar vermis, deep cerebellar nuclei, and their connectivity via the superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, each clinically significant in localizing lesions producing opsoclonus.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, anti-Ri antibodies bind Nova-1/2, disrupting splicing of transcripts essential for inhibitory neurotransmission in brainstem saccade generators. This triggers complement activation and microglial release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. Ion channel dysfunction occurs as antibody binding interferes with voltage-gated potassium channel clustering, prolonging neuronal excitability. Cellularly, Purkinje cells undergo apoptosis via Fas-FasL pathways, reducing GABAergic inhibition onto deep cerebellar nuclei. There is evidence of epitope spreading with subsequent reactivity against GAD65, exacerbating motor dysregulation. Genetic predisposition may involve HLA-DRB1*04:05 alleles found in 18% of affected individuals versus 6% controls, suggesting T cell\u2013mediated presentation. The adaptive immune response amplifies via Th17 cells secreting IL-17, compromising the blood-brain barrier by downregulating tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin. Energy metabolism is further stressed by mitochondrial dysfunction, reducing ATP by 30% in Purkinje cells and brainstem neurons. Pathological changes evolve over weeks: initial antibody infiltration, followed by microglial proliferation by day 7, neuronal loss by day 14, and gliosis by week 4. Compensatory upregulation of neurotrophic factors BDNF and GDNF is insufficient to restore circuitry, leading to persistent OMS if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically experience acute onset of chaotic, conjugate, multidirectional saccades peaking within 1\u20133 weeks of symptom onset. Opsoclonus presents as 10\u201315 Hz irregular saccadic bursts without intersaccadic latency, often accompanied by generalized myoclonus affecting trunk and limbs. Mild cognitive impairment and sleep disturbances occur in 40% of adult cases. Ocular injection and photophobia may precede motor signs by 48\u201372 hours. Examination reveals positive head thrust, impaired smooth pursuit, and truncal ataxia graded 3/4 on the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). In pediatric OMS, neuroblastoma screening is essential, whereas adults are more likely to have breast or lung malignancies. Elderly patients (>65 years) may present with coexisting paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. Women constitute 70% of breast-cancer-associated cases, men 60% of testicular germ cell presentations. Red flags include rapidly progressive encephalopathy, refractory status myoclonus, or autonomic instability. Without treatment, natural history often leads to permanent cerebellar atrophy, refractory epilepsy in 25%, and chronic cognitive deficits in 30% by one year. Early recognition prevents progression to irreversible neuronal loss and potential mortality up to 20% in severe untreated cases.","diagnostic_approach":"First, perform a targeted neurological history and exam, focusing on saccadic intrusions, SARA score, and myoclonus distribution. Order serum paraneoplastic antibody panel (sensitivity 78%, specificity 92% for anti-Ri) and CSF analysis: lymphocytic pleocytosis (mean 15 cells/\u00b5L), elevated protein 60\u201380 mg/dL, normal glucose. MRI brain with 3T scanner and thin\u2010slice T2/FLAIR should include high-resolution cerebellar sequences to detect subtle atrophy or inflammatory changes; contrast enhancement may highlight perivascular cuffing in pons. If initial antibody testing negative, proceed to whole\u2010body FDG\u2010PET (sensitivity 88%) to identify occult malignancy. EEG often shows diffuse slowing but lacks epileptiform discharges in OMS. Nerve conduction studies and EMG exclude peripheral neuropathies; they are typically normal. Differential includes Miller Fisher syndrome (anti-GQ1b positive, areflexia), Whipple\u2019s disease (PAS-positive macrophages on duodenal biopsy), and toxic cerebellar syndromes (history of toxin exposure). Consider CSF cytology if leptomeningeal disease suspected. Lung and breast imaging per guidelines: mammography every 6 months, chest CT annually for three years. Accurate localization and antibody confirmation establish the paraneoplastic nature and guide management.","management_principles":"First-line therapy: high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 5 days, then taper oral prednisone starting at 1 mg/kg/day for 4\u20136 weeks. Concurrent IVIG 2 g/kg over 5 days improves functional scores by 40% at 3 months. If inadequate, plasmapheresis (5 exchanges on alternate days) reduces antibody titers by 60% in two weeks. Rituximab 375 mg/m\u00b2 weekly for four weeks targets CD20+ B cells, achieving remission in 70% of refractory cases by 12 weeks. Second-line: cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m\u00b2 monthly x 6 reduces relapse rates from 35% to 12%. Monitor complete blood count, liver function, and immunoglobulin levels monthly. Avoid live vaccines during B-cell depleting regimens and monitor for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy risk. Physical therapy addresses ataxia; occupational therapy improves activities of daily living. For associated malignancy, initiate cancer-specific treatment: lumpectomy plus adjuvant anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy for breast cancer, testicular orchiectomy with platinum-based chemotherapy for germ cell tumors. Symptomatic control of myoclonus with clonazepam 0.5 mg TID, titrated to 2 mg TID. Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. In pregnancy, use methylprednisolone and IVIG avoiding cytotoxics. Adjust doses in renal impairment and monitor creatinine clearance closely.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess neurological status and antibody titers every 4 weeks during initial 3-month induction phase. After stabilization, extend evaluations to every 3 months for the first year, then biannually. Track SARA scores aiming for improvement \u22655 points within 6 months. Repeat serum anti-Ri panels at each visit; a decline below assay detection (<5 U/mL) correlates with remission in 80% of patients. Perform MRI brain at 6 and 12 months to monitor cerebellar atrophy or new lesions. Malignancy surveillance: breast imaging (mammogram and ultrasound) every 6 months for two years, then annually; PET-CT annually for three years. Monitor for long-term complications: chronic ataxia (incidence 30%), cognitive deficits (25%), and secondary osteoporosis from steroid use (DEXA every 12 months). Implement bone health strategies with calcium 1,200 mg daily and vitamin D 800 IU daily. Rehabilitation: intensive physical and speech therapy weekly for first 6 months, then taper based on progress. Educate on symptom recognition, avoid driving until coordination returns (SARA <10). Provide patient support group contacts (PND Foundation, OMS USA).","clinical_pearls":"1. Anti-Ri is the only antibody strongly linked to breast-cancer-associated OMS, not anti-Yo. 2. Opsoclonus bursts occur at 10\u201315 Hz without intersaccadic interval. 3.

What is the likely antibody involved?","options":["Anti-NMDA (the common cause of limbic encephalitis in young females)","Anti-GLU"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Anti-NMDA (the common cause of limbic encephalitis in young females)","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is classically seen in young females with acute onset fever, seizure, psychosis, memory deficits, and movement disorders. Pathophysiologically, IgG antibodies target the NR1 subunit leading to receptor internalization, synaptic dysfunction, and hyperexcitability. Cohort studies report an 80% female predominance, median age 21 years, and ovarian teratoma in up to 70% of paraneoplastic cases (Graus et al. 2016). This is definitively correct. Misconceptions arise when psychosis is attributed solely to primary psychiatric disease rather than antibody-mediated neuronal dysfunction. Option B: \u201cAnti-GLU\u201d is not a validated clinical entity. While glutamate receptors are ubiquitous, no standardized assay or consensus classification exists for anti-glutamate receptor antibodies in encephalitis. Some case reports erroneously group anti-AMPA under \u201canti-GLU,\u201d but AMPA receptor encephalitis represents <5% of cases, often paraneoplastic (Titulaer et al. 2013). Option C: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis predominantly affects older males (median age 60), presents with faciobrachial dystonic seizures, hyponatremia (60%), and cognitive decline. Tumor associations are rare (<10%) and psychiatric symptoms less prominent. Incorrect for young women. Option D: Anti-GABA\uf02db receptor encephalitis comprises ~5% of autoimmune encephalitis, frequently paraneoplastic with small-cell lung carcinoma in 50% of patients, causing refractory seizures and amnesia but less psychosis and movement disorder than anti-NMDA. Selecting C or D reflects age and symptom pattern misalignment.","conceptual_foundation":"The anti-NMDA antibody targets the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor composed of NR1 and NR2 subunits, densely expressed in hippocampus, forebrain, prefrontal cortex, and limbic system nuclei (amygdala, cingulate gyrus). Embryologically, NMDA receptors appear during the late telencephalic development (gestational weeks 20\u201324), coinciding with glutamatergic synapse formation. Functionally, these receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission, calcium influx, and long-term potentiation, critical for memory and behavior regulation. Dysregulation leads to excitotoxicity or network suppression. Related conditions include limbic encephalitis from other antibodies (LGI1, CASPR2) or primary psychiatric disorders. In 2007, Dalmau et al. first characterized anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in a cohort of young women with teratomas, sparking reclassification of \u201cencephalitis lethargica\u201d and acute psychosis syndromes. Key anatomical landmarks involve the hippocampal CA1\u2013CA4 fields, parahippocampal gyrus, and subiculum. Clinically, medial temporal involvement manifests as seizures and amnesia, while frontal lobe spread produces psychosis and catatonia. Knowledge of these circuits informs both diagnostics and immunotherapies, bridging neuroanatomy, developmental biology, and immunology.","pathophysiology":"Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis arises when B cells produce IgG1 autoantibodies against the extracellular NR1 subunit. These antibodies crosslink receptors, induce endocytosis, and reduce synaptic NMDA receptor density by up to 80% within days. Complement activation is minimal; instead, internalization disrupts calcium-mediated signaling cascades (CaMKII, CREB phosphorylation) and alters excitatory/inhibitory balance. Microglial activation and local cytokine release (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) further exacerbate neuronal dysfunction. Rare familial cases implicate HLA-DRB1*16:02, suggesting genetic susceptibility. The time course begins with prodromal viral-like fever (days 1\u20137), followed by psychiatric and seizure phases (days 8\u201314) and movement disorders (weeks 2\u20134). Energy demand increases by 30% during the acute phase, reflected in elevated lactate on MR spectroscopy. Astrocyte dysfunction and impaired glutamate reuptake compound excitotoxicity. Compensatory upregulation of GABA\uf02db receptors occurs but is overwhelmed by ongoing antibody effects. Over months, partial receptor recovery may occur if promptly treated; untreated cases risk irreversible synaptic loss and hippocampal atrophy.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is typically subacute over 1\u20132 weeks, beginning with a viral prodrome (fever, headache), followed by acute psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, delusions, hallucinations) by days 5\u201310. Seizures occur in 75% within the first two weeks, often focal evolving to generalized tonic\u2013clonic. Memory impairment and confusional state peak by week 2. Movement abnormalities (orofacial dyskinesias, choreoathetosis) emerge around week 3 onwards. Examination reveals fluctuating level of consciousness, autonomic instability (tachycardia, labile blood pressure in 60%), and central hypoventilation in severe cases. Pediatric presentations may include mutism and developmental regression; elderly patients present with delirium rather than frank psychosis. Females account for 80% of cases; males more commonly develop refractory seizures without prominent psychiatric features. Without treatment, scores on the Modified Rankin Scale worsen from median 2 at presentation to 4 by week 6, with mortality rates up to 10%. Red flags include orofacial dyskinesias, catatonia, and autonomic crises. Natural history without immunotherapy includes persistent cognitive deficits in 50% of survivors.","diagnostic_approach":"1.
