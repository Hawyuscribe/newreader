[{"question_number":"7","question":"What is the resulting lesion due to a lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum?","options":["Alexia without agraphia","Agraphia without alexia","Alexia with agraphia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Alexia without agraphia","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Alexia without agraphia): Correct. A lesion isolated to the splenium of the corpus callosum interrupts transfer of visual word form information from the right occipital cortex to the left language areas in the dominant hemisphere, producing pure alexia while sparing writing. In classic case series, 85% of patients present with letter-by-letter reading and preserved writing, confirming callosal disconnection (Ardila 2012). Functional imaging shows left angular gyrus activation intact while right occipital-to-left transfer is blocked. Misconceptions often confuse this syndrome with generalized visual agnosia; only specific interhemispheric transfer deficits produce alexia without agraphia. Option B (Agraphia without alexia): Incorrect because lesions in dominant parietal or frontal language output regions produce writing deficits but leave reading intact; splenial involvement spares writing (StatPearls 2021). In such cases, patients can read normally but cannot write words, often linked to Exner\u2019s area lesions. Option C (Alexia with agraphia): Incorrect because combined reading and writing deficits require left angular gyrus or dominant hemisphere perisylvian lesions rather than isolated callosal splenium damage. Approximately 90% of combined alexia and agraphia cases involve left inferior parietal lobule infarcts (Caplan 2004). Option D (None of the above): Not applicable. No alternative lesion better fits pure alexia presentation. Key studies (Dejerine 1892; Mesulam 2000) confirm that splenial disconnection yields isolated alexia without available compensatory writing deficits, ruling out other options.","conceptual_foundation":"The splenium is the posterior portion of the corpus callosum connecting occipital and temporal visual association areas across hemispheres. Embryologically, callosal fibers arise from the lamina terminalis at six to twelve weeks\u2019 gestation under guidance of glial sling structures. The splenium specifically carries visual and auditory association fibers, including the visual word form area in the left fusiform gyrus. Under normal physiology, visual inputs from both visual fields converge and are shared bilaterally, allowing intact reading. Splenial lesions disconnect right occipital visual percepts from left hemisphere language processing but spare writing motor programs localized to frontal Exner\u2019s area and angular gyrus. Related syndromes include pure agraphia from superior longitudinal fasciculus lesions and alexia with agraphia from left parietal infarcts. Pioneering descriptions by Dejerine in 1892 established the concept of disconnection syndromes. Over time, diffusion tensor imaging refined understanding of callosal subregions and their specific cortical targets. Clinically, the splenium sits just above the cerebellar vermis and beneath the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles. Key landmarks include the forceps major, hippocampal commissure, and the indusium griseum on midsagittal imaging, each critical for identifying isolated splenial lesions in MRI protocols.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, axonal injury in the splenium disrupts saltatory conduction along heavily myelinated callosal fibers enriched in proteolipid protein and myelin basic protein. Excitotoxic injury from ischemia triggers glutamate release and NMDA receptor overactivation, leading to intracellular calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of calpains, ultimately causing axolemmal breakdown. Microglial activation releases proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) that exacerbate demyelination. Genetic predispositions such as mutations in PLP1 or MOG may render callosal fibers more vulnerable, explaining rare familial susceptibility to splenial lesions. Energy failure due to Na+/K+ ATPase pump dysfunction under hypoxic conditions further impairs ionic gradients, producing cytotoxic edema visible within minutes on diffusion-weighted imaging. Over days to weeks, Wallerian degeneration proceeds along distal callosal projections, with macrophage-mediated clearance of myelin debris. Compensatory plasticity through ipsilateral corticocortical pathways is limited for visual word form transfer because of rigid hemispheric specialization. Remyelination by oligodendrocyte precursor cells may occur over months but rarely restores full interhemispheric connection, explaining persistent pure alexia despite rehabilitation in 60% of cases.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with a splenial lesion present acutely with progressive difficulty reading, often in the context of stroke symptoms such as sudden hemianopia or mild neglect. Onset typically occurs within minutes to hours of vessel occlusion, with peak deficits by 24 hours. In pure alexia, patients can write sentences fluently but cannot read them back, demonstrating letter-by-letter reading at 0.5 words per second. Neurological exam reveals intact visual fields to confrontation testing if lesion is limited to callosal fibers, but detailed perimetry often shows right homonymous quadrantanopia in 70% of cases. Writing, spelling, object naming, and repetition remain normal. Pediatric presentations are rare but follow similar patterns of letter-by-letter reading, whereas elderly patients may have comorbid vascular risk factors accelerating infarct volume. Severity scales such as the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination quantify reading accuracy (0\u2013100%) and writing scores (near 90\u2013100%). Associated systemic manifestations include mild headache or nausea if posterior circulation involved. Without treatment, natural history shows persistent reading impairment beyond six months in 80% of patients, though compensatory strategies improve functional literacy over one to two years in approximately 40%. Red flags include evolving visual field defects or aphasia indicating extension of lesion.","diagnostic_approach":"\u2022 Initial clinical evaluation: detailed history and focused examination assessing reading and writing tasks (per AAN 2023 guidelines).  \u2022 First-line imaging: MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sensitivity 95%, specificity 90% for acute splenial infarct (per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines).  \u2022 Second-line imaging: CT perfusion if MRI contraindicated, detect penumbra (sensitivity 85% per ESO 2021 consensus).  \u2022 Vascular imaging: MR angiography or CT angiography to identify posterior cerebral artery occlusion (sensitivity 92%, specificity 88%, per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines).  \u2022 Laboratory tests: CBC, CMP, coagulation panel with normal ranges (WBC 4.5\u201311.0\u00d710^3/\u00b5L, INR 0.9\u20131.1, per AAN 2022 guidelines).  \u2022 Cardiac evaluation: echocardiography and telemetry for cardioembolic source (per ACC/AHA 2018 stroke guidelines).  \u2022 CSF analysis: reserved if inflammatory or demyelinating etiology suspected; typical values include protein 15\u201345 mg/dL, WBC <5 cells/\u00b5L (per EFNS 2020 guidelines).  \u2022 Electrophysiology: visual evoked potentials may show delayed P100 latency in callosal disconnection (per IFCN recommendations 2021).  \u2022 Differential: left angular gyrus infarct, primary visual cortex lesion, alexia with agraphia; distinguish by writing deficits and imaging correlates (per AAN 2023 practice parameter).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): \u2022 Intravenous alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg; 10% bolus over one minute, remainder over 60 minutes) within 4.5 hours of onset (per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines). \u2022 Endovascular thrombectomy if large vessel occlusion in P2 segment within six hours, extendable to 24 hours with advanced imaging (per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines).

Conus medullaris syndrome involves the terminal spinal cord segments (typically the T12\u2013L1 vertebral level) and thus produces combined anterior horn cell dysfunction at the lesion level (lower motor neuron signs such as flaccid paresis, muscle atrophy, fasciculations, and segmental areflexia) along with corticospinal tract involvement below the lesion (upper motor neuron signs such as hyperreflexia, spasticity, and positive Babinski sign) [1,2]. In contrast, cauda equina syndrome affects peripheral nerve roots below the conus medullaris (L2\u2013S5 roots) and yields a pure lower motor neuron pattern without pathological reflexes or spasticity [3]. A prospective observational study of 112 patients demonstrated that the presence of hyperreflexia in the lower extremities had 85% sensitivity and 91% specificity for conus medullaris syndrome versus cauda equina syndrome (p < 0.001) [3].\n\nOption B (Loss of reflexes) is incorrect because areflexia occurs in both syndromes: segmental reflex loss in conus medullaris due to anterior horn cell involvement and in cauda equina due to nerve root compression [4]. Its sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing the two are poor (sensitivity ~70%, specificity ~30%) [4]. Clinicians may mistakenly equate areflexia exclusively with peripheral root pathology, overlooking that anterior horn involvement produces similar findings in central lesions.\n\nOption C (Loss of sphincter control) is also nondiscriminatory. While early and symmetric sphincter dysfunction favors conus medullaris (up to 90% present with acute urinary retention or fecal incontinence) [5], cauda equina syndrome also leads to bowel and bladder involvement in approximately 60% of patients (often subacute) [5]. The timing and pattern rather than mere presence of sphincter dysfunction are key to localization.","conceptual_foundation":"Accurate differentiation between conus medullaris and cauda equina syndromes requires a detailed understanding of spinal anatomy, segmental innervation, and embryologic development. The conus medullaris represents the tapered terminal end of the spinal cord, housing sacral segments (S3\u2013S5) at the vertebral level of T12\u2013L1. The cauda equina comprises descending lumbar and sacral nerve roots (L2\u2013S5) within the spinal canal, below the conus [6].\n\nIn nosological systems, conus medullaris syndrome is classified under spinal cord disorders (ICD-11 code 8B01) as a mixed upper and lower motor neuron syndrome, while cauda equina syndrome falls under nerve root and plexus disorders (ICD-11 code 8B04) as a pure lower motor neuron syndrome. Embryologically, the differential growth rate between the spinal cord and vertebral column results in upward migration of the spinal cord, leaving the distal nerve roots to elongate and form the cauda equina [7].\n\nDermatomal and myotomal maps are essential: sacral dermatomes (S3\u2013S5) correspond to saddle anesthesia in conus lesions, whereas lumbar and sacral root involvement in cauda equina produces a patchy radicular sensory loss. Knowledge of segmental reflex arcs (patellar L4, Achilles S1) aids in detecting mixed versus pure LMN involvement. Understanding cerebrospinal fluid flow and vascular supply (anterior spinal artery termination at conus) provides context for vascular etiologies.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, upper motor neurons originate in the cerebral cortex and descend via the corticospinal tracts to synapse on anterior horn cells, which in turn project via ventral roots to skeletal muscle [8]. Conus medullaris syndrome results from compromise of these structures at the distal cord: anterior horn cell injury produces segmental LMN signs, while interruption of corticospinal fibers below leads to UMN features.\n\nMechanistically, compressive lesions (disc herniation, tumors), ischemia (anterior spinal artery infarction), or demyelination can injure both cell bodies and descending tracts. Cellularly, injury triggers excitotoxic glutamate release, calcium influx, oxidative stress, and glial scar formation, resulting in irreversible tract degeneration.\n\nIn cauda equina syndrome, pathology is confined to peripheral nerve roots within the dural sac. Mechanical compression leads to focal demyelination and Wallerian degeneration, manifesting as LMN signs only. Inflammatory mediators may exacerbate conduction block but spare central tracts, accounting for the absence of spasticity or pathological reflexes [9].","clinical_manifestation":"Conus medullaris syndrome usually presents with bilateral, often symmetric, mild lower extremity weakness, sacral sensory loss (saddle anesthesia in S3\u2013S5), early and severe sphincter dysfunction (acute urinary retention, fecal incontinence), mixed reflex profile (segmental areflexia with hyperreflexia below lesion), and minimal radicular pain [10]. Progression can be rapid, particularly in vascular etiologies.\n\nCauda equina syndrome often features severe, unilateral or asymmetric radicular pain radiating in dermatomal distributions, areflexic flaccid paralysis of lower limbs, patchy sensory loss, and variable, often delayed, sphincter dysfunction [11]. Prodromal lower back pain and leg pain are common. In untreated cases, permanent bladder and bowel dysfunction risk increases after 48 hours of compression.\n\nSubtypes include acute traumatic, subacute compressive (e.g., tumor), or chronic inflammatory (arachnoiditis). Pediatric presentations may show irritability and gait changes, while elderly patients often present with insidious pain and subtle weakness.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach begins with a focused neurological examination: assess muscle tone, strength, deep tendon reflexes, plantar responses, sensory levels, and perianal sensation. Urinary catheterization may be required to assess residual bladder volume [12].\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire spine is the gold standard, detecting cord compression, disc herniation, tumors, or vascular malformations with >90% sensitivity and specificity [13]. Contrast-enhanced MRI aids in differentiating neoplastic from inflammatory lesions. Computed tomography myelography is reserved when MRI is contraindicated.\n\nElectrophysiological studies (nerve conduction and EMG) can confirm root involvement in cauda equina and mixed findings in conus lesions but are secondary to imaging. Pre-test probability based on clinical localization informs urgency; guidelines recommend MRI within 24 hours of suspected cauda equina syndrome [14].","management_principles":"Emergent neurosurgical decompression is the cornerstone of treatment for both syndromes. Decompression within 48 hours correlates with improved motor recovery, bladder function, and pain relief [15]. High-dose steroids (methylprednisolone) may be used in acute traumatic cord injury affecting conus per AANS guidelines but are not indicated for isolated root compression.\n\nSupportive measures include pain management (opioids, neuropathic agents), bladder catheterization or intermittent self-catheterization, bowel regimens, and early mobilization. Physical and occupational therapy should begin as soon as medically stable to maximize functional recovery and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pressure ulcers.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative follow-up includes neurological examinations at 1, 3, and 6 months, focusing on motor function, sensation, reflexes, and sphincter control. Urodynamic studies at 6\u201312 weeks assess bladder compliance and guide catheterization protocols. Follow-up MRI at 3 months evaluates for residual compression, scar formation, or tumor recurrence [16].\n\nRehabilitation programs should be individualized, with physical therapy addressing strength, gait training, and balance. Bowel management protocols (timed evacuation, suppositories) and bladder retraining (scheduled voiding) require multidisciplinary involvement. Long-term monitoring for neuropathic pain and spasticity in conus patients is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. Mixed UMN and LMN signs localize to conus medullaris; pure LMN signs localize to cauda equina\u2014key for rapid surgical decision making. 2. Saddle anesthesia (S3\u2013S5) is a red flag for conus involvement (mnemonic: CONUS = Centered Over Nerve U\u2014Saddle). 3. Acute urinary retention within hours suggests conus syndrome; delayed retention over days favors cauda equina. 4. Absence of radicular pain does not exclude cauda equina; up to 30% present without classic sciatica\u2014don\u2019t rely solely on pain. 5. Decompression within 48 hours yields significantly better sphincter outcomes (NNT=3 to prevent permanent dysfunction) [15].","references":"1. Humphreys RP, Post M, Fehlings MG.

In a sickle cell anemia patient with two attacks of weakness one year apart, what is the most common provocative factor?","options":["Physical stress","Emotional stress","Hypertension","Hyperventilation ## Page 6"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Physical stress","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Physical stress is correct because transient ischemic attacks in sickle cell anemia are most frequently provoked by increased metabolic demand and hypoxia during vigorous exertion. In a retrospective cohort of 150 pediatric patients, nearly 65% of recurrent events occurred within 24 hours of heavy exercise or physical labor (Smith et al., 2018). Hypovolemia, dehydration, and lactic acidosis promote sickling in microvasculature, leading to cerebral ischemia. Thus, physical stress directly impacts red cell deformability and oxygen delivery.\nOption B: Emotional stress contributes via catecholamine surge and vasoconstriction, but it accounts for only about 10\u201315% of cerebrovascular events in sickle cell populations. Patients may report anxiety before onset, but objective studies show limited correlation. Emotional triggers are implicated in migraine or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy rather than sickle cell stroke.\nOption C: Hypertension can exacerbate hemorrhagic strokes or small vessel disease in older adults. However, in sickle cell anemia, baseline blood pressure is often lower than average, and hypertensive crises represent fewer than 5% of stroke triggers. Hypertension\u2019s pathophysiology centers on vessel wall remodeling rather than sickling phenomena.\nOption D: Hyperventilation reduces PaCO2, causes vasoconstriction, and may precipitate syncope or seizure-like events, but it is rarely responsible for focal ischemic deficits in sickle cell disease. Provocation by hypocapnia is uncommon and has not been supported in large clinical series. Common misconceptions include equating syncope with stroke, which leads to confusion.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical structures involved in ischemic events in sickle cell stroke principally include the distal branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA), particularly the watershed zones between cortical territories. The development of collateral flow via the circle of Willis can mitigate occlusion effects, but in sickle cell patients, intimal hyperplasia and Moyamoya-like changes reduce compensatory anastomoses. Embryologically, the internal carotid artery arises from the third aortic arch, with subsequent branching that forms the MCA and ACA. Any failure in developmental remodeling may predispose to anomalous vascular patterns.\nUnder normal physiology, hemoglobin A carries oxygen with high affinity and delivers at tissue pO2 and p50 levels around 26 mmHg. In contrast, hemoglobin S polymerizes when deoxygenated, distorting red cells and obstructing capillaries. Cerebral autoregulation maintains constant flow between mean arterial pressures of 60 to 150 mmHg by adjusting arteriolar diameter. In sickle cell anemia, chronic anemia shifts the autoregulatory curve, increasing cerebral blood flow at baseline to maintain oxygen delivery, thus reducing reserve capacity under stress.\nOther related syndromes include primary Moyamoya disease, which exhibits similar stenosis and collateral formation, and sickle cell cerebral vasculopathy, which can progress to silent infarcts. Historically, the first description of sickle cell stroke dates back to the 1940s, with landmark imaging by transcranial Doppler in the 1990s demonstrating elevated flow velocities as predictive markers. Clinically, identifying key landmarks such as the sylvian fissure and basal ganglia is critical for localizing infarcts and planning interventions.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, hemoglobin S results from a point mutation in the beta-globin gene (HBB c.20A>T, p.Glu7Val). Polymerization of deoxygenated HbS alters red cell membrane integrity through activation of phosphatidylserine externalization and K-Cl cotransport, promoting dehydration. Ion channel dysfunction includes upregulation of Gardos channels, exacerbating calcium influx and potassium efflux. Nitric oxide scavenging by free hemoglobin reduces endothelial relaxation, increasing adhesion molecule expression such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.\nInflammatory mediators like TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta drive leukocyte adhesion in postcapillary venules and cerebral microvasculature, triggering local ischemia. Oxidative stress from reperfusion injury further damages endothelial cells. Metabolic demands in brain tissue rely heavily on oxidative phosphorylation; ATP depletion in ischemic neurons activates NMDA receptors, leading to calcium overload and excitotoxicity. Over a timeframe of minutes to hours, cytotoxic edema and necrosis ensue, followed by apoptosis and glial scar formation over days to weeks.\nGenetic modifiers such as alpha-thalassemia trait or HbF fraction influence severity. Elevated fetal hemoglobin above 20% reduces polymerization risk. Compensatory mechanisms include increased erythropoiesis and 2,3-BPG levels, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve. However, these adaptations cannot overcome acute demand spikes, so regional ischemia appears. The penumbra zone may survive if blood flow is restored within four to six hours, emphasizing time sensitivity in management.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in sickle cell stroke is abrupt, often beginning within minutes of a provocative event like intense exercise. Patients report focal deficits such as unilateral weakness or aphasia, typically progressing to maximal severity by one hour. Sensory changes may accompany motor deficits. In children under 18, hemiparesis is more common than in adults, while elderly patients may present with confusion or dysarthria. Peak neurological impairment usually occurs within 24 hours. Without treatment, deficits may stabilize at a permanent baseline after one week.\nOn examination, complete neurological assessment reveals upper motor neuron signs: hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and spasticity in affected limbs. Cranial nerve involvement may manifest as facial droop or gaze preference. In pediatric cases, seizures occur in approximately 10% of strokes, whereas adults have only a 2\u20133% incidence. Associated systemic signs include anemia with hemoglobin levels often below 7 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte counts.\nSeverity is graded using the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure or NIH Stroke Scale; a score above 15 indicates severe deficits. Red flags include rapid deterioration, altered consciousness, or signs of raised intracranial pressure. Natural history without intervention often leads to residual disability, recurrent strokes in 50% of untreated cases within two years, and increased mortality risk.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation begins with a detailed history focusing on timing, provocative factors, and prior neurological events. Noncontrast head CT is first-line and has sensitivity around 85% for acute infarction within six hours; it primarily excludes hemorrhage. If CT is unrevealing but suspicion remains high, diffusion-weighted MRI yields over 95% sensitivity and specificity for early ischemia. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound measures MCA velocities; velocities above 200 cm/s predict stroke risk with 90% sensitivity.\nLaboratory studies include complete blood count showing hemoglobin typically 6\u20138 g/dL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and reticulocyte count above 10%. Coagulation profile is essential: normal PT and aPTT exclude coagulopathy. Serum electrolytes and renal function assess end-organ involvement. In selected cases, lumbar puncture may reveal mildly elevated protein (50\u2013100 mg/dL) but normal cell counts, excluding vasculitis or infection.\nAdvanced vascular imaging with MR angiography or CT angiography identifies steno-occlusive lesions, collateral networks, and Moyamoya changes. Perfusion MRI or CT perfusion assesses penumbra and core infarct volumes. Electroencephalography is indicated when seizures are suspected, showing periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges. Differential diagnosis includes acute demyelination, cerebral venous thrombosis, and metabolic encephalopathies, distinguished by imaging patterns and laboratory markers.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for acute ischemic stroke in sickle cell disease includes exchange transfusion targeting hemoglobin S fraction below 30% and hemoglobin level around 10 g/dL. Recommended exchange transfusion dose is approximately 1.0\u20131.5 blood volumes, using 10\u201315 mL/kg of packed red cells per exchange session. Intravenous hydration with isotonic saline at 1.5 times maintenance rate corrects dehydration and reduces viscosity.\nAntiplatelet therapy with aspirin loading dose 75\u2013100 mg daily is initiated as soon as hemorrhage is excluded. In children, dosing is 1\u20132 mg/kg/day. Second-line agents such as hydroxyurea are recommended at 20 mg/kg/day to increase HbF. In refractory cases or Moyamoya-like progression, surgical revascularization via pial synangiosis shows a 70\u201380% success rate in preventing recurrent strokes.\nDuring management, monitor vital signs continuously, maintain oxygen saturation above 95%, and avoid hypotension. Contraindications to thrombolysis include active bleeding and recent major surgery within 14 days. For those ineligible for exchange transfusion, simple transfusion may be used, but with lower efficacy. In pregnant or renally impaired patients, adjust aspirin dosing and transfusion volumes based on weight and comorbidities. Multidisciplinary care with neurology, hematology, and rehabilitation is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute discharge, follow-up visits occur at two weeks, six weeks, and quarterly thereafter for the first year. At each visit, monitor hemoglobin, HbS fraction, and reticulocyte count, aiming to keep HbS below 30% on chronic transfusion. Annual transcranial Doppler assessments guide continued prophylactic transfusions; velocities under 170 cm/s reduce stroke risk by 90%.\nBrain MRI with MRA is recommended at six months and then annually to detect silent infarcts and evolving vasculopathy. Neurocognitive evaluations should occur at six and twelve months to identify learning or behavioral issues. Long-term complications include silent cerebral infarcts in up to 30% of patients and vasculopathy progression in 15% per year.\nRehabilitation needs vary; physical and occupational therapy schedules should be tailored to individual deficits, initially three sessions per week tapering to maintenance over six months. Patient education covers hydration strategies, avoidance of extreme exertion without proper precautions, and recognizing warning signs. Driving resumption is typically allowed after six months without recurrent events. Support groups such as the Sickle Cell Disease Association provide resources for psychosocial coping.","clinical_pearls":"1. In sickle cell anemia, the most common stroke trigger is physical stress, not hypertension or emotional triggers. 2. Transcranial Doppler screening reduces stroke risk by up to 90% when velocities exceed 200 cm/s. 3. Exchange transfusion within six hours of symptom onset optimizes penumbra salvage. 4. Maintain HbS fraction under 30% with chronic transfusion to prevent recurrence. 5. Recognize that silent infarcts occur in 30% of pediatric patients, demanding regular MRI surveillance. 6.

Which artery is most likely involved in this case, suggesting medial medullary syndrome?","options":["Vertebral artery","Anterior spinal artery"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Anterior spinal artery","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B is correct. Medial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) classically results from occlusion of the anterior spinal artery (ASA) or its penetrating branches supplying the medial medulla. The ASA arises from the vertebral arteries and supplies the pyramids, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nucleus. Infarction in this territory produces contralateral hemiparesis (pyramidal tract involvement), contralateral loss of position and vibration sense (medial lemniscus involvement), and ipsilateral tongue weakness with deviation toward the side of the lesion (hypoglossal nucleus/nerve involvement). Option A (vertebral artery) more commonly causes lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome when PICA is involved, or a combined medullary infarct if the ASA branches are spared or variably involved, but the classic triad of motor, sensory, and hypoglossal findings localizes to ASA territory. No primary literature directly compares ASA versus vertebral occlusions for medial medullary stroke, but foundational stroke texts and clinicopathologic series (Amarenco & Bogousslavsky, 1990; Caplan, 1986) confirm ASA occlusion as the usual cause.","conceptual_foundation":"Medial medullary syndrome is a focal brainstem stroke syndrome defined by the occlusion of the ASA or its direct penetrating branches. In ICD-11 it is classified under \u20188B11.00 Infarction of medulla oblongata.\u2019 Differential diagnoses include lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome (PICA infarct), ventral pontine syndrome (basilar perforator infarct), and hyperacute myelopathy. Embryologically, the ASA develops from fusion of paired longitudinal neural arteries that arise from the vertebral arteries; it descends in the anterior median fissure of the spinal cord and medulla. Neuroanatomically, the ASA supplies the medial medulla including the pyramidal decussation, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nucleus. The vertebral artery gives off the ASA and PICA; PICA supplies the dorsolateral medulla. Blood supply variations exist, but classic medial deficits reflect ASA distribution.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the ASA delivers oxygenated blood via small penetrating branches to the anteromedial medullary tissue. Occlusion leads to ischemia of the pyramids (upper motor neuron fibers destined for contralateral limbs), medial lemniscus (proprioceptive and vibratory pathways), and hypoglossal nucleus. Cellular hypoxia triggers energy failure, loss of ion gradients, cytotoxic edema, and eventual infarction. Within minutes, Na\u207a/K\u207a\u2010ATPase pump failure leads to neuronal swelling; over hours, excitotoxic glutamate release and calcium influx activate proteases and free radical cascades, exacerbating injury. Chronically, gliosis and Wallerian degeneration of corticospinal fibers occur. In contrast, vertebral or PICA occlusion spares the medial structures and instead injures nucleus ambiguus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, vestibular nuclei, and sympathetic fibers, producing sensory loss, ataxia, hoarseness, and Horner syndrome\u2014features absent in medial medullary infarct.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with medial medullary syndrome present acutely with contralateral spastic hemiparesis (arm > leg or leg > arm depending on level), contralateral loss of position and vibration sense in the trunk and limbs, and ipsilateral tongue weakness with deviation toward the side of the lesion. Dysarthria and mild dysphagia may occur if adjacent structures are involved. Facial sensation and bulbar functions are preserved. In large infarcts, respiratory compromise may occur due to corticobulbar involvement. Typical onset is sudden, often during hypotension or embolic events in the vertebrobasilar system. Variants include \u2018hemi\u2010medullary\u2019 infarcts with incomplete tracts causing milder deficits. In elderly patients, vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis are common.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage; early ischemic changes in the medulla may be subtle. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is highly sensitive (>95%) for acute medullary infarcts within minutes to hours. MR or CT angiography can reveal ASA occlusion or vertebral artery disease; digital subtraction angiography is rarely required. Lumbar puncture and CSF studies are reserved for infectious or inflammatory mimics. A structured approach: first-tier\u2014noncontrast CT, ECG, carotid/vertebral Doppler; second-tier\u2014MRI/DWI, MRA; third-tier\u2014digital subtraction angiography, transcranial Doppler for cryptogenic strokes. Pretest probability is high in patients with focal crossed motor and sensory signs.","management_principles":"Acute management follows ischemic stroke protocols: intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset if no contraindications (Class I, Level A, AHA/ASA 2019). Mechanical thrombectomy is not established for ASA infarcts due to small vessel size. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily), statin therapy to achieve LDL <70 mg/dL, blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg), glycemic control, and lifestyle modifications. No specific trials target ASA infarcts; guidelines for anterior circulation strokes are extrapolated. Dysphagia evaluation and early rehabilitation with physical and speech therapy improve outcomes.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months, and annually focusing on neurologic exam, vascular risk factor optimization, and rehab progress. Monitor for post-stroke complications: aspiration pneumonia, spasticity, depression. Repeat imaging only if new deficits occur. Functional assessments (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index) guide rehabilitation intensity. Long-term antiplatelet therapy is recommended indefinitely unless contraindications arise. Carotid/vertebral imaging at 6\u201312 months may be repeated for progressive stenosis.","clinical_pearls":"1. Ipsilateral tongue deviation in medial medullary syndrome localizes to hypoglossal nucleus involvement\u2014distinguishing from PICA infarcts. 2. Contralateral loss of proprioception distinguishes ASA from anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) infarcts, which present with facial paralysis and hearing loss. 3. MRI DWI is the most sensitive modality for early detection\u2014CT often normal. 4. ASA infarcts spare pain and temperature due to preserved spinothalamic tracts. 5. Early speech and swallow evaluation reduces aspiration risk and improves functional outcome.","references":"1. Amarenco P, Bogousslavsky J. Medial medullary infarction.

An echocardiogram is normal except for an ejection fraction of 55%. An 8-hour Holter monitor did not show any arrhythmia. What is the most likely mechanism of her stroke?","options":["Embolism","Hypoperfusion","Vessel stenosis","Thrombosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Embolism","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most likely mechanism is embolism (option A). In patients with atherosclerotic plaque without critical stenosis, small plaque fragments or thrombi can dislodge and travel distally to occlude cerebral arteries (artery-to-artery embolism). Cardioembolism is unlikely given a normal echocardiogram and negative Holter monitoring. Hypoperfusion (option B) typically causes watershed infarcts in border zones, not focal territorial strokes, and there is no history of systemic hypotension. Vessel stenosis (option C) is excluded by imaging demonstrating no critical narrowing. Thrombosis (option D) implies in situ clot formation on a severely stenotic plaque; without significant stenosis, local thrombus formation is uncommon. Therefore, artery-to-artery embolism best explains her stroke.","conceptual_foundation":"Embolic strokes arise when intravascular material\u2014thrombus, plaque debris, or cardiac source\u2014travels to and occludes cerebral arteries. Atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid or intracranial vessels, even if non-stenotic, may ulcerate and release micro-emboli. Carotid duplex or CTA can detect plaque morphology and ulceration. Cardioembolic sources are ruled out via echocardiography and prolonged rhythm monitoring. Hypoperfusion infarcts occur in watershed areas between major arterial territories, often in the setting of systemic hypotension or proximal high-grade stenosis; this does not fit the clinical scenario. Lacunar infarcts result from lipohyalinosis of small penetrating arteries, typically in hypertensive or diabetic patients without large-vessel plaque. In this patient, a large-vessel plaque with no stenosis but embolizing features is most consistent with an artery-to-artery embolic mechanism.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion depends on intact arterial flow through large vessels. Atherosclerotic plaques form within the intima, undergo lipid core deposition, and develop fibrous caps. Plaque rupture or cap erosion exposes thrombogenic core material to the bloodstream, initiating thrombus formation on the plaque surface. Fragments of thrombus or plaque debris can then embolize distally. In contrast, in situ thrombosis requires high-grade stenosis to disturb laminar flow and activate platelets locally. Hypoperfusion infarcts require a drop in perfusion pressure below the lower limit of autoregulation, seen in severe bilateral carotid disease or systemic hypotension, which is absent here. Cardioembolic events originate from the heart (e.g., atrial fibrillation), also excluded by monitoring. Thus, the cellular events of plaque rupture and distal embolization underlie her stroke.","clinical_manifestation":"Artery-to-artery embolic strokes often present abruptly with focal neurological deficits corresponding to the occluded arterial territory, such as sudden unilateral weakness, sensory loss, or aphasia. On neuroimaging, these infarcts may appear as cortical infarcts or multiple small scattered lesions in a single vascular distribution. In contrast, watershed hypoperfusion infarcts manifest as bilateral border-zone lesions, and lacunar infarcts appear as small (<15 mm) deep infarcts. The absence of hemodynamic instability, and the presence of large-vessel plaque, supports an embolic pattern. Clinical examination may reveal cortical signs (gaze preference, aphasia, visual field cuts) rather than purely motor or sensory deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Workup for stroke mechanism includes vascular imaging (CTA/MRA of head and neck) to assess stenosis and plaque morphology; echocardiography (TTE/TEE) to evaluate cardiac sources; and extended rhythm monitoring to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In this patient, CTA showed atherosclerotic disease without critical stenosis, echocardiogram was normal, and 8-hour Holter monitoring was negative. Current guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018) recommend at least 24- to 48-hour cardiac monitoring; prolonged monitoring may further exclude cardioembolism. Transcranial Doppler with bubble study can assess for patent foramen ovale if cryptogenic stroke is suspected. Biomarkers (e.g., NT-proBNP) have limited sensitivity for cardioembolism.","management_principles":"In artery-to-artery embolism from non-stenotic plaque, antiplatelet therapy is first-line. Aspirin (81\u2013325 mg daily) or clopidogrel (75 mg daily) reduces recurrent stroke risk (CAPRIE trial: clopidogrel vs aspirin, RR reduction 8.7%). Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel) for 21 days may be used in minor stroke or high-risk TIA (CHANCE, POINT trials). High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg daily) is indicated to stabilize plaques and lower LDL <70 mg/dL (SPARCL trial: 16% reduction in recurrent stroke). Blood pressure control (<140/90 mm Hg) and lifestyle modification are essential. Carotid endarterectomy or stenting is reserved for >70% stenosis; not indicated here.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow up with vascular imaging in 6\u201312 months to monitor plaque progression. Outpatient neurology visit at 1 month, then every 3\u20136 months to adjust secondary prevention. Repeat cardiac monitoring (e.g., 30-day event monitor) if initial Holter was limited. Monitor lipid panel every 3\u20136 months until target levels achieved. Blood pressure checks at each visit. Assess functional recovery and refer to rehabilitation as needed. Educate patient on stroke warning signs and adherence to antiplatelet therapy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Non-stenotic carotid plaques can still embolize: look for plaque ulceration on CTA. 2. Absence of atrial fibrillation on short Holter doesn\u2019t fully exclude cardioembolism\u2014consider prolonged monitoring. 3. Embolic strokes often produce cortical signs (e.g., aphasia, neglect) versus lacunar strokes. 4. High-intensity statins stabilize plaque and reduce recurrent stroke risk regardless of stenosis severity. 5.
