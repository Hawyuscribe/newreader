Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Option A) presents with insidious memory impairment over years without prominent ataxia or myoclonus. Lewy body dementia (Option B) features visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and cognitive fluctuations rather than cerebellar signs or startle myoclonus. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (Option C) manifests as slowly progressive gait apraxia, urinary incontinence, and dementia\u2014lacking myoclonic jerks. Multiple system atrophy (Option D) can cause cerebellar ataxia (MSA\u2010C subtype) but usually presents with autonomic failure and parkinsonism rather than rapid dementia and stimulus-induced myoclonus. None of these four conditions match the full presentation; the correct diagnosis is CJD, which is not provided, so \u201cNone\u201d is the best answer.","conceptual_foundation":"Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by misfolded prion protein (PrP^Sc) and is classified under ICD-11 code 8A20.0 as a prion disease and in DSM-5-TR as a major neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease. Differential diagnoses include other rapidly progressive dementias\u2014autoimmune encephalitides, paraneoplastic syndromes, toxic\u2010metabolic encephalopathies, and atypical neurodegenerative disorders. Historically described by Creutzfeldt and Jakob in the 1920s, the molecular prion theory was established by Prusiner in 1982. Neuroanatomically, prion protein accumulation leads to vacuolation, gliosis, and neuronal loss predominantly in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia (caudate and putamen), thalamus (pulvinar), and cerebellum. MRI diffusion-weighted imaging reveals characteristic cortical ribboning and basal ganglia hyperintensities, reflecting involved white-matter tracts and cortical\u2013subcortical circuits. Molecular genetics implicate PRNP gene mutations (e.g., E200K) in familial cases, whereas sporadic CJD arises without identifiable mutations; variant CJD links to bovine spongiform encephalopathy exposure.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, cellular prion protein (PrP^C) is \u03b1-helical and involved in neuronal development and synaptic function. In CJD, PrP^C undergoes conformational change into \u03b2-sheet\u2013rich PrP^Sc, forming protease-resistant aggregates that template the conversion of native PrP^C into pathogenic PrP^Sc. This process triggers neuronal apoptosis, spongiform vacuolation, and astrocytic gliosis. At the cellular level, PrP^Sc disrupts calcium homeostasis, impairs mitochondrial function, and activates microglia with release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2). Cerebellar Purkinje cell loss explains ataxia; involvement of sensorimotor cortex and basal ganglia underlies myoclonus and exaggerated startle. In contrast, Alzheimer\u2019s disease features amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and tau tangles, Lewy body dementia involves \u03b1-synuclein Lewy bodies, normal pressure hydrocephalus reflects CSF dynamics without protein aggregation, and MSA features oligodendroglial \u03b1-synuclein inclusions without prion replication.","clinical_manifestation":"Sporadic CJD (85\u201390% of cases) typically presents in the sixth to seventh decade with rapidly progressive dementia (median survival 4\u20136 months). Cardinal features include:\n\u2022 Cognitive decline: memory loss and executive dysfunction in >90% of cases.\n\u2022 Cerebellar ataxia: gait instability and limb incoordination in ~60\u201365%.\n\u2022 Myoclonus/startle response: spontaneous or stimulus-induced jerks in ~80\u201385%.\n\u2022 Visual disturbances (e.g., cortical blindness) in 40\u201350%.\n\u2022 Pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs in ~50\u201360%.\nVariant CJD manifests in younger patients with psychiatric prodromes and the MRI \u201cpulvinar sign.\u201d Familial CJD presents similarly but often with earlier onset. The rapid time course (weeks to months) and presence of myoclonus differentiate CJD from other dementias, which progress over years. Untreated median survival is <6 months, with >90% mortality within one year.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier investigations:\n\u2022 MRI brain with DWI/FLAIR: cortical ribboning and basal ganglia hyperintensities yield sensitivity 91% and specificity 95% (Meissner et al., 2009).\n\u2022 EEG: periodic sharp wave complexes in ~60\u201370% (sensitivity 66%, specificity 74%).\n\u2022 CSF biomarkers: 14-3-3 protein (sensitivity 92%, specificity 80%); total tau (>1,300 pg/mL) increases specificity; RT-QuIC assay sensitivity 85\u201390%, specificity 98%.\nSecond-tier: PRNP gene sequencing for familial cases. Third-tier: brain biopsy only if diagnosis remains uncertain. Pre-test probability is high in rapid dementia with myoclonus; positive MRI plus RT-QuIC approaches 98% positive predictive value. False positives may occur in herpes encephalitis or paraneoplastic disease; correlation with clinical course is essential.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapies are available. Management is supportive and palliative:\n\u2022 Symptomatic control of myoclonus: levetiracetam 500\u20132,000 mg twice daily or valproate 500\u20131,000 mg/day; benzodiazepines for spasticity and agitation.\n\u2022 Nutritional support and swallow assessments; advance care planning for feeding decisions.\n\u2022 Management of pain, secretions, and respiratory complications with opioids and anticholinergics.\nInvestigational agents (quinacrine, pentosan polysulfate) have shown no survival benefit in controlled trials. Emphasis is on early hospice referral, psychosocial support, and family counseling.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule multidisciplinary reviews every 2\u20134 weeks to adjust symptom management and palliative care. Monitor for complications such as aspiration pneumonia, pressure ulcers, and immobility. No routine repeat MRI or CSF assays once diagnosis is confirmed. Functional status assessments (e.g., Barthel Index) monthly help guide supportive measures. Early discussion of advanced directives, do-not-resuscitate orders, and hospice enrollment is critical given the uniformly poor prognosis.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Vascular dementia. Epidemiological studies indicate that Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia (~60\u201380%), and vascular dementia is the second most common, accounting for approximately 10\u201320% of cases (O\u2019Brien & Thomas, 2015; AHA/ASA 2017). Vascular dementia arises from cerebrovascular disease that leads to focal or diffuse ischemic and hemorrhagic brain injury. The risk increases with age and vascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Option B (Dementia with Lewy bodies) accounts for approximately 5\u201315% of dementias and is less prevalent than vascular dementia (McKeith et al., 2017). Option C (Frontotemporal dementia) represents about 2\u201310% of cases and commonly presents at a younger age (<65 years) (Bang et al., 2015). Option D (Alzheimer\u2019s disease) is the most common cause, not the second. Common misconceptions include conflating mixed Alzheimer\u2019s and vascular pathology; however, pure vascular dementia remains the second leading cause.","conceptual_foundation":"Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterized by progressive decline in cognitive domains including memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial skills, affecting daily living (DSM-5-TR). In ICD-11, vascular dementia is coded under 6D83.0. Differential diagnoses include Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementias, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and reversible causes such as metabolic or infectious etiologies. Historically, Alzheimer\u2019s was first described by Alois Alzheimer in 1906; vascular dementia was recognized by Otto Binswanger and von Monakow in the early 20th century. Mixed dementia (AD + vascular changes) is common, underscoring overlapping pathology.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion is maintained by autoregulation across a range of blood pressures. In vascular dementia, chronic hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis lead to small vessel lipohyalinosis, lacunar infarcts, and white matter ischemic changes (Binswanger disease). Large vessel strokes can also produce multi-infarct dementia. Ischemia induces oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, microglial activation, and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Over time, neuronal loss and demyelination in strategic regions (e.g., hippocampus, prefrontal cortex) result in cognitive deficits. Vascular risk factor control can mitigate progression.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present with stepwise cognitive decline, correlating with new infarcts. Early executive dysfunction, slowed processing speed, and attention deficits are prominent, whereas memory impairment may be less severe initially compared to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Focal neurological signs (e.g., hemiparesis, gait disturbance) and vascular risk factors support the diagnosis. Subtypes include multi-infarct dementia, subcortical ischemic vascular disease, and strategic infarct dementia. Prevalence increases after age 65, with no strong sex predilection. The natural history shows cumulative deficits with each vascular insult.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes a detailed history, neurological exam, and screening cognitive tests (e.g., Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Neuroimaging with MRI is preferred to detect lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, and infarcts; CT may suffice if MRI is unavailable. Laboratory tests rule out reversible causes (TSH, B12, RPR). Second-tier: vascular imaging (MRA, carotid Doppler), echocardiography to identify embolic sources. Third-tier: advanced CSF biomarkers (e.g., neurofilament light chain) to differentiate mixed pathology. Sensitivity of MRI for small vessel disease is ~90% (Wardlaw et al., 2013).","management_principles":"Management focuses on vascular risk factor modification: blood pressure control (target <130/80 mmHg), statin therapy per AHA/ASA guidelines (Class I, Level A), diabetes management, smoking cessation, and antiplatelet therapy if indicated. Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil) have limited evidence in pure vascular dementia (Level B), but may be used off-label. Physical therapy and cognitive rehabilitation improve function. In selected patients with carotid stenosis >70%, endarterectomy reduces recurrent stroke risk (NNT 15 over 5 years).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up should occur every 3\u20136 months initially, monitoring blood pressure, lipid profile, and cognitive status with repeat MoCA or MMSE. MRI every 1\u20132 years may track progression of white matter disease. Caregiver support and education are critical. Transition to memory disorder center referral if rapid progression or uncertain diagnosis. Monitor for mood disturbances and behavioral changes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Stepwise decline with focal signs suggests vascular dementia; 2. Control hypertension aggressively to prevent progression; 3.

Major subtypes include Alzheimer\u2019s disease (the most common), vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. FTD is a primary neurodegenerative disorder affecting the frontal and/or temporal lobes, often beginning before age 65. The behavioral variant (bvFTD) is characterized by disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, compulsive behaviors, and hyperorality. The language variants (semantic and non-fluent) affect speech and comprehension. FTD is associated with tau or TDP-43 proteinopathies and can be familial.","pathophysiology":"In bvFTD, there is selective degeneration of the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and anterior temporal lobes. Histopathology shows neuronal loss, gliosis, and inclusion bodies composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (FTLD-tau) or TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). This leads to disruption of frontostriatal circuits regulating behavior, reward processing, and impulse control, manifesting as disinhibition, compulsivity, and hyperphagia.
