What will you give?","options":["Aspirin","Plavix","tPA","None of the above"],"subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2022","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"tPA","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is an antiplatelet agent given at 160\u2013300 mg within 48 hours of ischemic stroke onset to reduce early recurrence by about 22 %. However, it is not indicated as the sole acute reperfusion strategy within the 3-hour window when tPA is available. In patients with minor non\u2010disabling stroke or those who have contraindications to fibrinolytics (e.g., recent surgery, active bleeding, INR > 1.7), aspirin may be initiated after 24 hours but does not offer the same functional independence rates as early thrombolysis. A common misconception is that aspirin alone can substitute for tPA in all ischemic strokes; however, aspirin reduces risk modestly (NINDS subset data), whereas tPA can improve favorable outcomes by ~31 %. Option B: Clopidogrel (\u201cPlavix\u201d) 75 mg daily is a P2Y12 inhibitor used for long\u2010term secondary prevention and in minor non\u2010cardioembolic strokes, often combined with aspirin for 21 days in high\u2010risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke (POINT, CHANCE trials). It is not recommended for immediate reperfusion in a full\u2010blown acute stroke presenting within 3 hours. Relying on clopidogrel monotherapy in the hyperacute phase can delay definitive therapy. Option C: Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg; 10 % bolus, remainder over 60 min) administered within 3 hours (or up to 4.5 hours in select patients) is the only intervention shown in randomized controlled trials (NINDS, ECASS III) to significantly improve functional independence at 90 days (absolute increase ~13\u201316 %) with a symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) risk of ~6 %. The pathophysiological basis is fibrin clot degradation and reperfusion of ischemic penumbra. Misconceptions include overestimating hemorrhage risk, yet modern protocols achieve door\u2010to\u2010needle times <60 minutes and improve outcomes. Option D: \u201cNone of the above\u201d is incorrect given clear guideline recommendations (AHA/ASA 2018) for tPA in eligible hyperacute ischemic stroke within the therapeutic window. No reasonable clinical scenario justifies withholding reperfusion when there are no contraindications and the patient presents within 3 hours with salvageable tissue on CT.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute ischemic stroke involves sudden cessation of blood flow in cerebral arteries\u2014most commonly the middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk or its branches. The MCA supplies lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes including motor cortex, Wernicke\u2019s and Broca\u2019s areas, as well as the internal capsule. Embryologically, the internal carotid system and circle of Willis arise from the third aortic arch and dorsal aorta, with collateral anastomoses forming by week 4\u20135. Under normal conditions, cerebral blood flow (CBF) is maintained at ~50 mL/100 g/min with autoregulation between mean arterial pressures of 60\u2013150 mm Hg, mediated by pial arterioles and endothelial nitric oxide. Failure of autoregulation leads to ischemic core and surrounding penumbra. Historically, stroke was first characterized by Virchow in the 19th century and later by Moniz who introduced cerebral angiography in 1927. Landmark anatomical landmarks include the Sylvian fissure overlying the MCA, the lenticulostriate branches supplying deep nuclei, and the internal capsule\u2019s posterior limb critical for motor conduction. Recognizing cortical versus lacunar syndromes guides vascular localization and urgency of reperfusion. The evolution from supportive care to hyperacute thrombolysis transformed outcome paradigms in the 1990s, emphasizing time\u2010sensitive intervention to rescue penumbral tissue before irreversible infarction.","pathophysiology":"Ischemic stroke pathophysiology begins with arterial occlusion, often due to cardioembolism (atrial fibrillation) or atherothrombotic plaque rupture (stenosis > 70 %). Clot formation activates intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascades, resulting in fibrin mesh. Downstream, energy failure halts Na\u207a/K\u207a\u2010ATPase, causing neuronal depolarization, glutamate release, and excitotoxicity via NMDA and AMPA receptor overactivation. Calcium influx triggers proteases, lipases, and free radical generation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage membranes and mitochondria. Microglial activation releases IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and MMP-9, degrading blood\u2013brain barrier and promoting edema. Genetic predispositions include NOTCH3 mutations (CADASIL) and factor V Leiden in younger patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs ATP, exacerbating ion dysregulation. Apoptotic pathways engage BAX/BAK and caspases in penumbral neurons over hours to days. Hypoxia\u2010inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but may worsen edema. The ischemic core becomes irreversibly infarcted within 5\u201310 minutes; the penumbra persists for up to 6 hours if collateral flow exists. Reperfusion injury can occur upon clot lysis, with additional oxidative stress and hemorrhagic conversion. Compensatory collateral recruitment via leptomeningeal vessels is often insufficient in the absence of timely revascularization.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms begin abruptly, often peaking within minutes. Patients report sudden focal deficits: contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, aphasia when dominant hemisphere is involved, or hemispatial neglect in non\u2010dominant side. Visual field cuts (homonymous hemianopia), dysarthria, ataxia (if cerebellar), and gaze deviation toward the lesion side are common. Examination reveals upper motor neuron signs: brisk reflexes, Babinski sign, and spasticity developing over days. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) quantifies severity (0\u201342), with scores \u2265 6 often indicating large vessel occlusion. Elderly patients may present more subtly with confusion or gait instability; children more often have seizures at onset. Women may report atypical features like headache or altered consciousness. Systemic signs include hyperglycemia in ~40 % and blood pressure elevations of 160\u2013200/90\u2013100 mm Hg. Red flags for hemorrhage include severe headache, vomiting, and depressed level of consciousness. Without treatment, infarct evolves over 24\u201372 hours, edema peaks at 3\u20135 days, and risk of malignant MCA syndrome with midline shift is ~10 %. Natural reperfusion occurs in ~15 % of cases, but most deficits persist or worsen without intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"Hyperacute stroke protocol requires triage within 10 minutes: airway, breathing, circulation. Obtain noncontrast head CT within 20 minutes (sensitivity 95 % for hemorrhage, specificity ~100 %). If no bleed, proceed to CTA (sensitivity 85 % for large vessel occlusion) or CT perfusion to evaluate penumbra/core mismatch. MRI with DWI is 88\u2013100 % sensitive for hyperacute infarction but less available emergently. Laboratory tests: glucose (normal 70\u2013140 mg/dL), complete blood count (platelets > 100 \u00d7 10\u2079/L), PT/INR (< 1.7), aPTT (< 40 s), electrolytes, renal function (creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL), troponin. ECG rules out arrhythmias. Echocardiography assesses cardiac source. In select cases, lumbar puncture is not indicated if hemorrhage has been excluded. Carotid duplex ultrasound (sensitivity 88 %, specificity 94 %) identifies high\u2010grade stenosis. EEG may distinguish seizures from stroke mimics (e.g., Todd\u2019s paralysis). Differential diagnoses include seizure, migraine, hypoglycemia, conversion disorder, and subdural hematoma\u2014distinguished by imaging, lab tests, and clinical context.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is IV alteplase (tPA) dosed at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg; 10 % bolus over 1 minute, remainder infused over 60 minutes) administered within 3 hours of symptom onset (Class I, Level A). In selected patients aged < 80 years without diabetes or prior stroke, window extends to 4.5 hours (0.9 mg/kg, same regimen). Tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus is an emerging alternative in large vessel occlusions. Blood pressure must be < 185/110 mm Hg before and < 180/105 mm Hg for 24 hours post\u2010tPA, using labetalol 10\u201320 mg IV or nicardipine infusion at 5 mg/h. If contraindications to tPA exist, mechanical thrombectomy is recommended within 6 hours (up to 24 hours if favorable perfusion imaging). After 24 hours without hemorrhage, initiate aspirin 160\u2013325 mg daily or dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel) for minor strokes (NIHSS \u2264 3). Manage hyperglycemia to target 140\u2013180 mg/dL and fever (< 37.5 \u00b0C). Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with intermittent pneumatic compression and early mobilization. In refractory cerebral edema, hemicraniectomy may be considered in malignant MCA infarction (mortality reduction from 80 % to 30 %).","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute therapy, patients should be monitored in a dedicated stroke unit for at least 24\u201348 hours with frequent neurological checks every 1\u20132 hours. Repeat noncontrast CT at 24 hours assesses hemorrhagic transformation. Outpatient follow-up at 2 weeks evaluates functional status (modified Rankin Scale), blood pressure (< 130/80 mm Hg), lipids (LDL < 70 mg/dL), and glycemic control (HbA1c < 7 %). Carotid imaging at 2\u20134 weeks determines need for endarterectomy if stenosis > 70 % within 14 days. Antithrombotic regimen should be reviewed at 1 month for adherence and side effects. Long-term complications include post\u2010stroke depression (incidence ~30 %), spasticity (~40 %), and cognitive impairment (~25 %). Rehabilitation begins immediately, with intensity of 3\u20135 hours/day for 6 weeks increasing independence. Driving may be resumed after 3 months if NIHSS \u2264 1 and no major deficits. Patient education covers medication adherence, lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation, Mediterranean diet), and recognition of recurrent stroke warning signs. Support resources include the American Stroke Association and local rehabilitation services.","clinical_pearls":"1. \u201cTime is brain\u201d: ~1.9 million neurons lost per minute of untreated ischemia. 2.

The landmark Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) showed an 92% relative risk reduction in first stroke among high\u2010risk pediatric patients receiving regular transfusions (Adams et al., NEJM 1998;339(1):5\u201311). Angioplasty and stenting are not appropriate because sickle\u2010related vasculopathy does not involve focal atherosclerotic lesions amenable to endovascular dilation. Observation alone carries a high risk of stroke in children with elevated Transcranial Doppler velocities >200 cm/s and is not guideline\u2010recommended.","conceptual_foundation":"Sickle cell disease (ICD-11: EB60) results from a point mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene (HBB) leading to polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S within erythrocytes. This causes vaso\u2010occlusion, chronic hemolysis, endothelial dysfunction, and intimal hyperplasia in cerebral arteries (e.g., internal carotid and middle cerebral). Chronic transfusions lower the proportion of sickled cells and mitigate endothelial activation, preventing ischemic infarction. Hydroxyurea can raise fetal hemoglobin but was shown to be less effective than transfusions for primary stroke prevention (Strouse et al., Blood 2008;111(3):1191\u20136).","pathophysiology":"Normal microvascular perfusion relies on deformable erythrocytes. In sickle cell disease, polymerization of HbS under hypoxic conditions causes red cell rigidity, microvascular occlusion, and turbulent flow. Endothelial shear stress triggers adhesion molecule upregulation (VCAM-1, ICAM-1), intimal hyperplasia, and arterial stenosis. Chronic transfusions reduce HbS percentages, restore normal rheology, and diminish endothelial activation cascades (decreased NF-\u03baB signaling), thereby preventing progressive vasculopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with sickle cell disease often present with focal neurologic deficits, seizures, or silent infarcts detected on MRI. The natural history shows an annual first\u2010stroke risk of approximately 0.67 events per 100 patient\u2010years in untreated high\u2010risk pediatric cohorts with elevated TCD velocities; chronic transfusion reduces this to 0.05 per 100 patient\u2010years (STOP Trial).

Thus all given options are unsupported and the correct answer is None of the options is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"A thorough understanding of vascular neurology and hemostasis is required to link a mechanism to a clinical syndrome. Hypertension (chronic elevation of arterial pressure) leads to lipohyalinosis and Charcot\u2013Bouchard microaneurysms in small penetrating arteries; coagulopathy (defects in coagulation factors or platelet function) causes spontaneous bleeding in multiple sites; saccular aneurysms (berry aneurysms) at circle of Willis branch points present with subarachnoid hemorrhage upon rupture. None of these concepts can be applied here due to absent context. In ICD-11, hemorrhagic stroke subtypes are coded separately for hypertensive hemorrhage (8A80.0) and nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (8A82).
