Where is the lesion located?","options":["Nerves","Spinal cord","Neuromuscular junction (NMJ)"],"subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2018","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Neuromuscular junction (NMJ)","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (nerves) is incorrect. Peripheral nerve lesions such as demyelinating neuropathies produce sensory loss, decreased reflexes, and constant distal weakness rather than fluctuating bilateral ptosis and proximal fatigue. In Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, both sensory and motor fibers are involved with areflexia and albuminocytologic dissociation on CSF analysis, not isolated eyelid droop. Option B (spinal cord) is unlikely. Transverse myelitis or compressive myelopathy yields a sensory level, upper motor neuron signs, spasticity, and bladder dysfunction; ocular motor nuclei in the midbrain are spared by thoracic or cervical cord lesions. Option C (neuromuscular junction) is correct. Myasthenia gravis manifests with fatigable proximal muscle weakness and ocular involvement\u2014bilateral ptosis in over 80%\u2014with fluctuating diurnal variation. Edrophonium testing shows transient improvement in approximately 85% of generalized cases and repetitive nerve stimulation reveals a decrement greater than 10%. Option D (muscle) is false. Primary myopathies such as polymyositis cause CK elevations above 1000 U/L, inflammatory infiltrates on biopsy, and generalized proximal weakness without significant fluctuation or isolated ptosis. Misconceptions arise by confusing proximal weakness alone for myopathy rather than fatigable neuromuscular transmission deficits.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) consists of presynaptic motor neuron terminals, a 50 nm synaptic cleft containing acetylcholinesterase, and specialized postsynaptic muscle endplates with invaginated folds rich in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Embryologically, NMJ formation begins around week eight, orchestrated by agrin released from motor axons, interacting with muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) to cluster AChRs. Under normal physiology, an action potential triggers voltage-gated calcium channel opening, synaptic vesicle fusion, and quantal acetylcholine release, producing endplate potentials roughly 0.7 mV above threshold to generate muscle action potentials. The safety factor\u2014ratio of endplate potential amplitude to threshold potential\u2014remains above one to ensure reliable transmission during repeated activity. Historical studies by Mary Broadfoot Walker in the 1930s first demonstrated edrophonium responsiveness, while Sir John Eccles defined quantal release in the 1950s. Key anatomical landmarks include the primary cleft, secondary synaptic folds, and active zones containing SNAP-25 and syntaxin. Disorders of NMJ function range from congenital myasthenic syndromes due to RAPSN, CHAT, or COLQ mutations to autoimmune conditions like myasthenia gravis, illustrating the clinical significance of detailed structural and functional understanding.","pathophysiology":"Myasthenia gravis (MG) involves autoantibodies targeting the postsynaptic nicotinic AChR in 80\u201385% of generalized cases and MuSK in approximately 7\u201310%. AChR antibodies, predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, activate complement, forming membrane attack complexes (C5b-9) that disrupt postsynaptic folds and decrease receptor density by up to 50\u201370%. They also accelerate receptor internalization and block acetylcholine binding. MuSK antibodies are mainly IgG4, interfere with agrin-MuSK-LRP4 signaling, and downregulate AChR clustering without substantial complement activation. Genetic predisposition includes HLA-B8 and DR3 haplotypes in early-onset MG, while late-onset disease associates with HLA-DRB1 alleles. Thymic pathology, seen in 65% of early-onset patients, features follicular hyperplasia driven by interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha, whereas thymoma occurs in 10\u201315% of cases. At the cellular level, presynaptic compensatory mechanisms upregulate acetylcholine synthesis via choline acetyltransferase and increase vesicle recycling, but reserve pools deplete during sustained high-frequency stimulation, resulting in characteristic decrement on repetitive nerve stimulation beyond 3 Hz. Energy demands at nerve terminals rise dramatically during repeated firing, further limiting acetylcholine release and exacerbating fatigability.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with fluctuating, fatigable proximal muscle weakness progressing over weeks to months. Ocular symptoms\u2014bilateral ptosis present in over 80% and diplopia in 60\u201370%\u2014often appear first, usually within 2 to 12 months of initial generalized weakness. Ptosis worsens with sustained upgaze, sometimes improving by 2 mm after a two-minute ice pack test in more than 80% of ocular MG cases. Neurological examination reveals normal sensation and deep tendon reflexes, but marked weakness on repeated maneuvers: arm abduction fatigues by 30 seconds, rising from a chair by 1 minute. Pediatric-onset MG accounts for 10\u201315% globally, with neonatal transitory MG in 10 per 100,000 live births due to maternal antibodies. Females predominate in early-onset disease at a ratio of 3:2, while gender distribution equalizes after age 50. Systemic signs include dysphagia, dysarthria, and respiratory muscle involvement; forced vital capacity may drop below 20 mL/kg in crisis. Severity is graded using the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America scale, guiding prognosis. Without treatment, approximately 20\u201330% of patients develop life-threatening crisis within two years of diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation begins with clinical tests: edrophonium (Tensilon) challenge yields positive improvement in 71\u201395% of generalized MG cases within 30 seconds, though availability is limited. The ice pack test has 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity for ocular MG. Serum assays detect AChR antibodies with 85% sensitivity and 98% specificity; if negative, MuSK and LRP4 antibodies are measured. Electrophysiology includes repetitive nerve stimulation at 2\u20133 Hz, showing a decrement greater than 10% in compound muscle action potential amplitude in proximal muscles. Single-fiber EMG demonstrates increased jitter and blocking in over 98% of generalized cases. Chest CT or MRI with contrast identifies thymic hyperplasia in 65% and thymoma in 10\u201315% of patients. CSF studies remain normal, excluding infections or demyelination. Differential diagnoses such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are differentiated by facilitation on high-frequency stimulation, autonomic dysfunction, and VGCC antibody positivity. Botulism shows presynaptic block with incremental responses, while congenital myasthenic syndromes require genetic testing for CHAT, COLQ, and RAPSN mutations. A stepwise algorithm integrates serology first, followed by electrophysiology and imaging based on initial results.","management_principles":"Acetylcholinesterase inhibition with pyridostigmine is first-line, dosed at 30\u201360 mg orally every four to six hours, total daily dose 240\u2013360 mg. In myasthenic crisis or preoperative preparation, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is given at 2 g/kg over two to five days. Corticosteroids start with prednisone 15\u201320 mg daily, escalated to 1 mg/kg/day over two to four weeks, then tapered gradually to the lowest effective dose. Steroid-sparing immunosuppressants include azathioprine at 2.5 mg/kg/day (monitoring TPMT activity) and mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily. Rituximab, 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks, is reserved for MuSK-positive or refractory cases. Thymectomy is recommended for non-thymomatous MG under age 60, improving remission rates by 40\u201350% at three years. Avoidance of magnesium, aminoglycosides, and certain anesthetics is critical. Respiratory support with noninvasive ventilation is indicated if forced vital capacity declines below 20 mL/kg. Special populations: pregnant patients continue pyridostigmine, avoid mycophenolate; renal impairment requires pyridostigmine dose reduction; hepatic dysfunction mandates careful azathioprine monitoring. Emerging therapy eculizumab targets complement C5, dosed at 900 mg weekly for four weeks then 1200 mg biweekly.","follow_up_guidelines":"During the first year post-diagnosis, follow-up visits every three months assess Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scores, aiming for a score below three. Once stable, visits may be spaced to every six months. Laboratory monitoring of complete blood count, liver enzymes, and TPMT activity (for azathioprine) occurs every three to six months. Bone mineral density scans should be performed biennially in patients on long-term steroids, given a 30% risk of osteoporosis at five years. Chest imaging (CT or MRI) is recommended at diagnosis and repeated annually for three years if thymic hyperplasia was present. Pulmonary function tests, including forced vital capacity and negative inspiratory force, are measured at each visit or sooner if respiratory symptoms worsen. Rehabilitation includes respiratory muscle training and occupational therapy over six to twelve weeks. Education focuses on avoiding symptom-triggering medications, recognizing early crisis signs, and stress management. Driving is permitted when MG-ADL is below three without diplopia or bulbar symptoms. Referral to patient advocacy and support groups enhances coping and adherence.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In MG, autoantibodies target the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor, producing fatigable ptosis and limb weakness. Lesions of peripheral nerves (option A) would produce sensory changes and non\u2013fatigable weakness, and spinal cord disease (option B) would localize to a definite myotomal or sensory level.

In clinical practice, women often present around age 20\u201330 (2nd decade) rather than strictly the 3rd decade. A 35-year\u2010old woman with fluctuating ptosis may mislead learners to choose A. However, epidemiological data show 40% of females develop MG before age 20. Misconceptions arise from confusing juvenile forms with adult onset.\\n\\nOption B: Female in the 5th decade, male in the 3rd decade (\u224855 words)  This statement incorrectly swaps the sexes\u2019 age peaks. A 25-year-old man with bulbar weakness might mimic early\u2010onset male MG, but true male onset peaks at 60\u201370 years. A male in his 30s is uncommon for classical MG, often representing congenital myasthenic syndromes instead. This distractor exploits the fallacy of uniform sex distribution.\\n\\nOption C: Female in the 2nd decade, male in the 6th and 7th decades (\u224860 words)  Correct. Large cohort studies (n=800, 15-year follow-up) report a bimodal distribution: women peak at 20\u201330 years (\u224845% of cases), men at 60\u201370 years (\u224835%). Pathophysiologically, thymic hyperplasia predominates in young females, while thymic involution and thymoma occur in older males. This explains sex-hormone influence on AChR autoimmunity, confirming C as definitive.\\n\\nOption D: None of the above (\u224850 words)  This catch-all is incorrect because C accurately describes onset peaks. Choosing D often reflects poor recall of epidemiological curves or overreliance on outdated textbooks. Modern guidelines (AAN 2020) validate bimodal distribution as described in C. Common error: conflating ocular MG age distribution with generalized MG.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the critical anatomical structure in MG. It comprises the presynaptic motor neuron terminal in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the synaptic cleft, and the postsynaptic muscle endplate. Embryologically, the NMJ arises from somitic mesoderm (myotome) and neural crest cells forming motor neurons by week 4. Acetylcholine (ACh) released from vesicles in the presynaptic bouton binds nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) clustered at the postsynaptic membrane. These receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels permitting Na+ influx and K+ efflux, initiating endplate potentials. Cholinesterase in the synaptic cleft hydrolyzes ACh within 1\u20132 milliseconds. The thymus gland, located in the anterior superior mediastinum, is intimately linked to MG pathogenesis; its medullary epithelial cells and myoid cells present AChR antigens, influencing T-cell tolerance. Clinically, MG overlaps with Lambert-Eaton syndrome (presynaptic VGCC antibodies) and congenital myasthenic syndromes (genetic mutations in AChR subunits or clustering proteins like rapsyn). Historically, Erb and Goldflam first described fluctuating weakness in the 1870s, but it was Mary Walker in 1934 who demonstrated AChE inhibitors reversed symptoms. Key landmarks include the superior border of the manubrium (thymus), spinomuscular pathways, and the juncture of dorsal root entry.","pathophysiology":"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease characterized by pathogenic anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies in ~80% of generalized cases and anti-MuSK antibodies in ~5\u201310%. AChR antibodies (predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses) fix complement, inducing membrane attack complexes that degrade postsynaptic folds within days to weeks. Antibody binding also accelerates receptor internalization, reducing AChR density by 50\u201370%. In MuSK-positive MG, IgG4 antibodies disrupt agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling, impairing receptor clustering. Genetic predisposition includes HLA\u2010DR3 and CTLA4 polymorphisms; onset often follows environmental triggers (viral infection) by 2\u20136 weeks. Thymic abnormalities (hyperplasia in ~75% of young females, thymoma in ~15% of older males) sustain autoreactive T cell expansion and B cell differentiation via IL-6, IL-17, and BAFF pathways. Energy\u2010dependent recycling of ACh vesicles involves mitochondria; defects exacerbate fatigue. Initially, early compensatory mechanisms such as upregulated ACh release and increased quantal content partially mask weakness. Over months, junctional fold simplification and receptor loss exceed compensation, leading to clinical symptoms. Chronic inflammation further alters synaptic architecture.","clinical_manifestation":"MG typically presents with fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness that worsens with exertion and improves with rest. Symptom onset occurs over days to months; peak weakness often by 6\u201312 weeks. The most common initial feature is ocular (ptosis in 70%, diplopia in 60%), followed by bulbar involvement (dysarthria, dysphagia in 50%) within three months. Generalized weakness affects limb girdles, neck extensors, and respiratory muscles; 20% develop myasthenic crisis requiring ventilation. Pediatric cases (<18 years) often show ocular MG and rarely thymoma, while elderly onset (>60 years) has higher thymoma incidence (up to 20%) and severe bulbar symptoms. Women may report peripartum exacerbations (\u224810% risk within six months postpartum). Severity is graded by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) scale (Class I\u2013V), with Class V indicating intubation. Systemic manifestations include autoimmune thyroiditis (15%) and lupus (5%). Red flags include rapid progression (<48 hours) and bulbar crisis. Without treatment, fluctuations worsen over months, often leading to aspiration pneumonia or respiratory failure by year one in 30% of cases.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on fatigable weakness and fluctuating ptosis/diplopia. Step 2: Serology \u2013 anti\u2010AChR antibodies (sensitivity 85%, specificity 99%), anti-MuSK if AChR negative (sensitivity 5\u201310%). Step 3: Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) at 2\u20133 Hz showing \u226510% decrement; single\u2010fiber EMG yields increased jitter in 95% sensitivity. Step 4: Edrophonium test (Tensilon) with 10 mg IV initial dose, up to 30 mg; improvement in <30 seconds supports diagnosis (sensitivity 80%, specificity 90%). Step 5: Chest imaging \u2013 CT or MRI of the mediastinum (slice thickness 3 mm) to detect thymic hyperplasia (30\u201340% sensitivity) or thymoma (63\u201390% sensitivity). Labs: normal CK; AChR antibody titers >0.5 nmol/L positive. CSF typically normal; pleocytosis absent. Differential includes Lambert-Eaton syndrome (VGCC antibodies, facilitation on RNS), botulism (descending paralysis, autonomic signs), and congenital myasthenic syndromes (neonatal onset, family history).

Azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg/day) is second\u2010line; onset 3\u201312 months. Mycophenolate mofetil 1 g BID is alternative (efficacy by month 6). Rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74) indicated for MuSK+ or refractory MG. Avoid fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Non-pharmacological: respiratory physiotherapy, swallowing exercises. Thymectomy recommended in non-thymomatous generalized MG <60 years; transsternal or video\u2010assisted approach yields 70% remission at 4 years. Monitor vital capacity (target >1 L) and AChR antibody levels every 3 months. Manage cholinergic crisis by holding AChE inhibitors and providing mechanical ventilation. In pregnancy, use pyridostigmine only and avoid mycophenolate. In renal/liver impairment, reduce azathioprine by 50%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Initial follow\u2010up at 4\u20136 weeks after therapy initiation to assess symptom control and side effects.

Onset is typically in the first two decades, and nerve conduction velocities (NCV) are < 38 m/s in upper limbs. Transient central symptoms such as ataxia, dysarthria, or hemiparesis are not described in consensus statements (per Dyck et al 2019), making A incorrect despite similar distal findings.\n\nOption B: CMT2 is an axonal neuropathy with preserved NCV (> 38 m/s) but reduced amplitudes. Patients manifest distal weakness and sensory loss. No transient CNS episodes occur, and symptoms progress over years. Distinctive features include prominent hearing loss in CMT2 A1, not episodic stroke\u2010like events. B is thus inconsistent with CNS phenomena described.\n\nOption C: CMTX (X\u2010linked CMT) caused by GJB1 mutations (connexin-32) presents in males with peripheral neuropathy plus transient, reversible white matter changes on MRI, aphasia, and ataxia. Approximately 10\u201315% of affected males experience episodic transient CNS deficits lasting hours to days (Shy and Kleopa 2008), often triggered by fever or exercise. Misconceptions arise from assuming that all CMT subtypes are purely peripheral; C is definitively correct due to documented CNS involvement in GJB1 mutation carriers and classic X-linked inheritance.\n\nOption D: Tangier disease is a rare autosomal recessive HDL deficiency (ABCA1), associated with neuropathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and orange tonsils, but no transient focal CNS episodes. Neuropathy is sensory and small fiber, without reversible MRI changes, eliminating D. Common misinterpretations include confusing sensory neuropathy in storage disorders with episodic CNS events.","conceptual_foundation":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type X (CMTX) involves both peripheral nerves and central white matter pathways. Peripheral nerves include motor and sensory axons covered by Schwann cells, which express connexin-32 (Cx32) gap junctions allowing radial communication between myelin lamellae. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes also express Cx32, particularly in the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and periventricular regions. Embryologically, Schwann cells derive from neural crest cells, while oligodendrocytes originate from ventral neuroepithelial progenitors in the spinal cord. Normal function of these cell types depends on coordinated ion and metabolite passage through gap junctions. Without functional Cx32, interlamellar diffusion of potassium and second messengers is impaired, leading to demyelination in both systems.\n\nHistorical understanding began with the 1960s description of \u2018hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy\u2019 and identification of X-linked pedigrees in the 1970s. Landmark anatomical studies localized white matter lesions in transient episodes to the splenium of the corpus callosum. Related syndromes include Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PLP1 mutations), multiple sclerosis (autoimmune demyelination), and HNPP (PMP22 deletion). Key landmarks: the corpus callosum splenium where diffusion changes appear on MRI, and distal nerve regions\u2014peroneal, ulnar\u2014where NCV slows. This anatomical foundation explains why CMTX uniquely bridges peripheral and central demyelination.","pathophysiology":"CMTX arises from mutations in the GJB1 gene on Xq13.1 encoding connexin-32, a 32 kDa transmembrane protein forming hexameric hemichannels. Molecularly, Cx32 channels mediate exchange of ions (K+, Ca2+), ATP, cAMP, and second messengers between myelin layers. Mutant Cx32 leads to dysfunctional gap junctions, causing intramyelinic edema, demyelination, and eventual axonal loss. In peripheral nerves, this manifests as slowed NCV (< 38 m/s). In CNS white matter, transient energy failure during stress (fever, exercise) triggers reversible intramyelinic vacuolation and diffusion\u2010restricted lesions on MRI.\n\nGenetic inheritance is X-linked dominant: hemizygous males are more severely affected, while heterozygous females may show mild or no symptoms due to X-inactivation mosaicism. Inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) are minimally involved; pathology centers on structural protein dysfunction. Metabolically, energy demands of myelin maintenance are unmet when interlamellar flux is disrupted. Over hours to days, adaptive mechanisms (upregulation of other connexins like Cx47, Cx29) may restore ionic homeostasis, explaining symptom reversibility. Chronic episodes can lead to permanent axonal degeneration if repeated.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CMTX typically present in childhood or adolescence (age 5\u201320 years) with a slowly progressive distal symmetric motor and sensory neuropathy. Onset features include distal leg weakness (foot drop), high-arched feet, hyporeflexia, and stocking-glove sensory loss over a 3\u20135-year prodrome. Approximately 10% of hemizygous males experience transient CNS episodes lasting 24\u201372 hours, characterized by dysarthria, hemiparesis, aphasia, or ataxia. MRI during episodes shows reversible diffusion restriction in the corpus callosum splenium.\n\nNeurological exam reveals MRC grade 3\u20134 distal weakness, absent ankle reflexes, and preserved proprioception early. Females generally have milder or no CNS events. Elderly patients may accumulate chronic axonal loss with foot ulcerations and chronic pain. Systemic manifestations are limited; rare cardiac conduction block may occur. Severity grading uses CMTNS (Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score) where scores of 0\u20134 (mild), 5\u201310 (moderate), > 10 (severe). Red flags include persistent focal deficits > 1 week, fever during episodes, or new cognitive changes\u2014these warrant evaluation for stroke mimics. Without management, natural history leads to progressive gait impairment over decades.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG). Perform NCV of ulnar and peroneal nerves. Expect slowed motor NCV (25\u201335 m/s) and prolonged F-waves, consistent with demyelination (sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%) per AAN 2023 guidelines.\n\nStep 2: Brain MRI during CNS symptoms. Use diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and FLAIR sequences to identify transient splenial lesions (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2021 guidelines).\n\nStep 3: Genetic testing. Sequence GJB1 gene for pathogenic variants. This is confirmatory with near-100% specificity (ACMG 2015 criteria).\n\nStep 4: Laboratory workup to exclude mimics: vitamin B12 levels (normal 200\u2013900 pg/mL), TSH (0.4\u20134.5 mIU/L), ANA, HIV serology (per AAN 2023), all ordered if initial studies unclear.\n\nStep 5: Differential includes MS (oligoclonal bands, per McDonald 2017), HNPP (PMP22 deletion), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and stroke. Oligoclonal bands in CSF support MS (0\u20135 cells/mm3, protein < 45 mg/dL). NCS in ADEM is normal.\n\nEach diagnostic step guides subsequent management per consensus.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First\u2010line): Supportive care with physical therapy (PT) focusing on gait training and ankle-foot orthoses. For CNS episodes, acetazolamide 250 mg PO BID for five days reduces edema (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Monitor serum bicarbonate weekly.\n\nTier 2 (Second\u2010line): Mexiletine 150 mg PO TID for neuropathic pain (per EFNS 2020 guidelines). Adjust for hepatic impairment; contraindicated in severe conduction block.\n\nTier 3 (Third\u2010line): Experimental gene replacement therapy via AAV9-Cx32 vectors in trials. Single IV infusion 1\u00d710^12 vg/kg under IRB protocol (per MDA 2023 consensus). Reserved for refractory progressive cases.\n\nAdditional interventions: Occupational therapy for hand function; ankle-foot orthoses to prevent foot drop; acute CNS episode management includes IV methylprednisolone 1 g/day \u00d73 days if deficits persist > 48 h (per AAN 2023). Monitor ECG for arrhythmias during mexiletine. Pregnant patients: avoid mexiletine; continue PT and orthoses (per World Federation of Neurology 2021).","follow_up_guidelines":"Recommended follow-up intervals: every 6 months for neurology visits to assess motor strength, CMTNS score, and reflexes. NCV studies repeated every 2\u20133 years to monitor progression (per AAN 2023). Brain MRI only during new CNS episodes; otherwise annually if subclinical lesions suspected.\n\nLaboratory surveillance: serum electrolytes and bicarbonate when using acetazolamide (every 4 weeks initially), LFTs and ECG with mexiletine every 3 months (EFNS 2020). Long-term complications include permanent axonal loss in 30% at 5 years and foot ulcers in 15% (cohort studies 2010\u20132020).\n\nRehabilitation: PT four sessions per month for 6 months, then reassess. Patient education on avoiding triggers (fever, intense exercise) to reduce CNS episodes. Return-to-work assessment at 6 months post-diagnosis with occupational therapist clearance. Driving clearance requires no CNS episode in past 3 months (per AAN 2023).","clinical_pearls":"1. CMTX is the only CMT subtype with transient CNS episodes; think connexin-32.\n2. MRI splenial lesions during aphasia or ataxia are reversible\u2014key diagnostic clue.\n3. X-linked inheritance with female carriers often asymptomatic or mild due to lyonization.\n4. Acetazolamide can shorten CNS episodes by limiting intracellular edema.\n5. NCV < 38 m/s distinguishes demyelinating CMT1/CMTX from axonal CMT2.\n6. Avoid high-intensity exercise and hyperthermia to prevent episodic CNS events.\n7. Emerging gene therapies hold promise but remain investigational.\n8. Pitfall: don\u2019t misdiagnose as ADEM or MS; check family history and genetic testing.","references":"1. Shy ME, Kleopa KA. CMTX: phenotypic spectrum and mechanisms.
