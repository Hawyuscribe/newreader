[{"question_number":"2","question":"A child presents with symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). What is the most significant risk factor for developing MS?","options":["Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)","Cytomegalovirus (CMV)"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). Multiple large epidemiological studies have demonstrated a strong association between prior EBV infection and the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). In a landmark prospective cohort study of US military personnel (Ascherio et al. JAMA 2001;286(24):3083\u20133088), the risk of MS was negligible among EBV-seronegative individuals but rose more than 30-fold after seroconversion (HR 32.4, 95% CI 4.8\u2013217). A nested case\u2013control study in Sweden (Nielsen et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2007;78(10):1090\u20131095) found that hospitalization for infectious mononucleosis increased MS risk two-to-threefold (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.8\u20133.0). By contrast, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity has no demonstrated positive association with MS and may even be inversely correlated (Belbasis et al. Lancet Neurol 2015;14(3):263\u2013273). CMV infection does not meet the temporality, strength, or consistency criteria required to be considered a causal risk factor for MS. Common misconceptions include conflating general herpesvirus exposure with MS risk; only EBV shows consistent, robust data with high-level evidence (Level A).","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis is classified under ICD-11 8A40 and as a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system in DSM-5-TR (328.89). It is an immune-mediated disease characterized by focal demyelinated plaques, diffuse neurodegeneration, and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Key elements of the conceptual framework include genetic predisposition (e.g., HLA-DRB1*15:01), environmental triggers (vitamin D deficiency, smoking, EBV infection), and dysregulated adaptive immunity. EBV is a ubiquitous \u03b3-herpesvirus that infects >95% of adults and establishes lifelong latency in B cells. The hypothesized mechanism involves molecular mimicry between EBV nuclear antigens and myelin proteins, aberrant B-cell activation, and recruitment of autoreactive T cells. Differential diagnoses include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-IgG), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and leukodystrophies. Historically, MS nomenclature evolved from Charcot\u2019s sclerosis (1868) to the adoption of McDonald criteria (2001, 2005, 2010, 2017), incorporating MRI and cerebrospinal fluid findings to establish dissemination in space and time.","pathophysiology":"Normal central nervous system physiology relies on oligodendrocytes to form myelin sheaths that facilitate saltatory conduction. In MS, autoreactive CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells cross the blood\u2013brain barrier via endothelial VCAM-1 interactions, guided by chemokines (e.g., CXCL10). EBV-infected B cells serve as antigen-presenting cells, presenting myelin autoantigens and perpetuating T-cell\u2013mediated inflammation. Key molecular events include upregulation of MMP-9, cytokine release (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17), complement activation, and microglial\u2013macrophage infiltration. Chronic lesion formation leads to axonal transection, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. CMV infection does not induce similar autoreactive B-cell expansion against CNS antigens and instead skews toward immunoregulatory CD8+ T-cell responses, potentially dampening autoimmunity. Temporal progression involves acute inflammatory demyelination followed by incomplete remyelination and gliosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Pediatric-onset MS often presents with polyfocal neurological deficits: optic neuritis (20\u201350%), brainstem syndromes, cerebellar signs, and motor or sensory disturbances. Relapse rate in children is higher than in adults (1.3 vs. 0.8 per year; Gorman et al. Neurology 2009;72(5):419\u2013425). EBV serostatus does not influence phenotypic presentation but correlates with later disease onset. CMV-seropositive children do not show altered MS phenotypes. Key clinical variants include relapsing\u2013remitting MS (85\u201390% at onset), primary progressive MS (10\u201315%), and radiologically isolated syndrome. Untreated pediatric MS often accrues disability more rapidly, with an EDSS score of 4 reached a median of 14 years after onset. Diagnostic criteria (2017 McDonald) require \u22652 lesions in \u22652 CNS regions and dissemination in time via new lesions or CSF oligoclonal bands (sensitivity 87%, specificity 94%).","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach begins with clinical suspicion in a child with \u22652 non-traumatic CNS events separated in space and time. First-tier investigations include brain and spinal MRI with and without gadolinium (sensitivity 90%, specificity 80%), and CSF analysis for oligoclonal bands (OCBs; sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%). EBV serology is not included in the McDonald criteria but may inform epidemiological risk; CMV serology is not recommended. Second-tier tests include visual evoked potentials and serum anti-AQP4/MOG antibodies to exclude NMOSD/MOGAD. Third-tier investigations\u2014 such as advanced imaging (7T MRI) or CSF neurofilament light chain\u2014 remain research tools. Pretest probability in an EBV-seropositive pediatric patient with typical demyelinating events is high (>90%).","management_principles":"First-line disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) include interferon-beta (Class I evidence; ARR reduction ~30%), glatiramer acetate (ARR reduction ~29%), and dimethyl fumarate (ARR reduction ~53%). Natalizumab (ARR reduction ~68%) is reserved for highly active disease. No EBV-targeted antivirals have demonstrated MS prevention. Emerging EBV vaccines are under investigation in Phase II trials. Management in children requires weight-based dosing and monitoring (CBC, LFTs) per AAN guidelines (2018). CMV antivirals are not indicated in MS.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes clinical assessment every 3\u20136 months and annual MRI to monitor lesion burden. EDSS scoring assesses disability. Laboratory monitoring depends on DMT (e.g., PML surveillance with John Cunningham virus antibody index in natalizumab users). EBV viral load is not routinely monitored. Transition considerations include counseling adolescents on pregnancy risks and family planning. Rehabilitation services (PT, OT) should be integrated early.","clinical_pearls":"1. EBV seropositivity approaches 100% in MS patients\u2014 a history of infectious mononucleosis doubles MS risk (OR ~2.3). Mnemonic: \"MONO for MS\". 2. CMV seropositivity does not increase MS risk; may be immune-modulatory. 3. Pediatric MS relapse rates exceed adult rates; early DMT reduces disability accrual. 4. Oligoclonal bands in CSF but not serum indicate intrathecal IgG synthesis (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%). 5. Emerging EBV vaccines may represent future preventive strategies.","references":"1.

High\u2010dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg daily for 5 days) is the first\u2010line therapy for acute neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) relapses (Wingerchuk et al. 2015; level B evidence). In cases refractory to steroids or when deficits are severe, plasma exchange (PLEX) is recommended as second\u2010line rescue therapy (Trebst et al. 2018; level B evidence). Option A alone omits PLEX for steroid\u2010refractory cases; option B alone omits the initial steroid bolus; option D (slow prednisone taper without high\u2010dose steroids) is inadequate for acute attack management and is not standard of care per current NMOSD guidelines (Wingerchuk et al. 2015).","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an astrocytopathy mediated by pathogenic aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) autoantibodies. In ICD-11, NMOSD falls under immune-mediated demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system. Differential diagnoses include multiple sclerosis, MOG-IgG\u2013associated disease, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and systemic autoimmune disorders. Historically regarded as a variant of MS, NMOSD was reclassified in 2006 upon discovery of AQP4-IgG, with formal diagnostic criteria updated by the International Panel in 2015 (Wingerchuk et al. 2015). Embryologically, astrocytes derive from neuroectoderm; AQP4 channels are enriched in perivascular astrocyte end-feet. Neuroanatomically, NMOSD lesions preferentially involve the optic nerves, spinal cord (longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis), area postrema, and brainstem. AQP4 expression and complement activation drive lesion distribution in watershed regions. Genetic predisposition includes HLA\u2010DRB1*03:01 in Caucasians and HLA\u2010DPB1*05:01 in Japanese populations.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, AQP4 channels regulate water homeostasis at the blood\u2013brain barrier. In NMOSD, AQP4-IgG binds to astrocytic AQP4, activates complement cascade (C1q, C3b), and engages antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity via natural killer cells. This leads to astrocyte necrosis, secondary demyelination, and neuronal loss. In acute attacks, massive cytokine (IL-6, IL-17) release increases blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, compounding tissue edema. IV methylprednisolone stabilizes membranes, reduces cytokine transcription via glucocorticoid receptors, and mitigates complement activation. PLEX mechanically removes circulating AQP4-IgG, complement components, and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, leading to rapid reduction in antibody titers (median decrease 60\u201370 % after five exchanges; Jacob et al. 2014). Steroid\u2010refractory disease often reflects high antibody load or delayed presentation.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute NMOSD attacks present with severe, bilateral or rapidly sequential optic neuritis (visual acuity often \u226420/200) or longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM; \u22653 contiguous spinal segments, flaccid weakness, sensory level, sphincter dysfunction). Area postrema syndrome manifests as intractable hiccups, nausea, vomiting. Attack onset is over hours to days. Severity often leads to permanent deficits without prompt therapy. Relapse rate pre\u2010treatment approximates 0.8\u20131.0 per year; untreated patients reach Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 6.0 within 5 years in 50 % of cases (Pittock et al. 2013). Attacks may also involve diencephalic and brainstem regions, causing narcolepsy or oculomotor disturbances.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Serum AQP4-IgG using cell\u2010based assay (sensitivity > 75 %, specificity > 95 %) and MRI spine (longitudinally extensive lesions). CSF oligoclonal bands are negative in two thirds. Second\u2010tier: CSF AQP4-IgG if serum negative, anti-MOG-IgG testing to rule out MOGAD. Third\u2010tier: Visual evoked potentials for subclinical optic involvement. Pretest probability based on core clinical characteristics and serology. MRI brain and optical coherence tomography (OCT) support differential. Historical tests (ELISA) replaced by cell\u2010based assays for higher accuracy.","management_principles":"Acute management per 2015 International Panel recommendations: IV methylprednisolone 1 g/day \u00d7 5 days (class II evidence; recommendation level B). For severe or steroid\u2010refractory relapses, initiate PLEX 5\u20137 exchanges every other day (class II; level B). Slow oral prednisone taper over 8 weeks starting at 1 mg/kg to prevent relapse rebound. Following acute therapy, begin maintenance immunosuppression with eculizumab, satralizumab, inebilizumab, rituximab, or azathioprine per patient profile and comorbidities (class I\u2013II evidence). Monitor for infusion reactions and infection risk; adjust dosages for renal/hepatic impairment.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post\u2010attack, assess clinical recovery weekly for the first month, then monthly until stable. MRI spine and brain at 3 months to document lesion resolution. Monitor AQP4-IgG titers serially if available; a rising titer may predict relapse. Evaluate EDSS and visual acuity at each visit. Annual bone density scanning if prolonged steroid use; infection surveillance for PLEX/rituximab. Transition to maintenance therapy within 4\u20136 weeks to reduce relapse risk. Patient education on early symptom recognition and prompt treatment seeking reduces permanent disability.","clinical_pearls":"1. High\u2010dose IV methylprednisolone within 7 days of attack onset yields best functional recovery (Wingerchuk et al. 2015). 2. Early PLEX (within 14 days) improves outcome in steroid\u2010refractory NMOSD attacks (Jacob et al. 2014). 3. AQP4-IgG cell\u2010based assays outperform ELISA (specificity > 95 % vs. 90 %, sensitivity > 75 % vs. 65 %)\u2014use for definitive diagnosis. 4. Slow oral prednisone taper (\u2265 8 weeks) mitigates post\u2010steroid relapse rebound. 5.

Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator with a half-life of 6\u20139 days, requiring a 2-month washout before conception due to reported teratogenicity in 4\u20138% of exposed animal pregnancies (per EMA 2018 guidelines). It is highly effective, reducing annualized relapse rates by 54% vs placebo and increasing T2 lesion volume reduction by 55% (TRANSFORMS trial, 2012). Common misconceptions include believing fingolimod is safe in pregnancy\u2014incorrect, since registry data show fetal malformations in 2\u20134% of first-trimester exposures (FDA 2020). Option B: Glatiramer acetate is generally considered safe in pregnancy with no required washout; disease activity remains low and relapse rates stay below 0.2 per year, making it unlikely to need a 2-month interruption (per AAN 2021). It acts as a myelin basic protein analog, shifting Th1 to Th2 responses. Option C: Interferons (e.g., IFN-\u03b2-1a and \u20111b) have pregnancy category C designations but observational data show relapse rates of 0.3\u20130.5 per year on therapy with minimal fetal risks; no mandated 2-month washout is recommended (per ECTRIMS 2019). Option D: Beta interferon is synonymous with some interferon-\u03b2 formulations; similarly, it requires no prolonged washout and is often continued through conception, maintaining ARR reduction of 30\u201340% (per NICE 2020). Only fingolimod necessitates extended cessation before pregnancy due to delayed elimination and teratogenic risk, establishing Option A as correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, primarily affecting white matter tracts in the periventricular regions, corpus callosum, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Key anatomical structures involve oligodendrocytes wrapping axons to form myelin sheaths that facilitate saltatory conduction at the nodes of Ranvier. The internal capsule and pyramidal tracts relay motor signals, while the dorsal columns convey proprioception. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from the ventral ventricular zone in the neural tube around gestational weeks 10\u201312. Normal physiology involves myelin maintenance by microglia and astrocytes, regulating ion homeostasis through channels such as Nav1.6 and Kv1.1. MS shares features with leukodystrophies and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, which target aquaporin-4 in astrocytes. Historically, Charcot first described plaques in 1868, and the autoimmune hypothesis evolved in the 1940s with demonstration of immune-mediated demyelination in animal models. Key landmarks include Dawson\u2019s fingers on MRI, the perivascular lymphocytic cuffing in pathology, and the immunological synapse at the node of Ranvier. Understanding these structures and their interplay underpins targeted therapies such as sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators.","pathophysiology":"Multiple sclerosis pathogenesis involves an interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers. On a molecular level, autoreactive T cells (both CD4+ Th1/Th17 and CD8+) breach the blood-brain barrier via upregulated matrix metalloproteinases and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VLA-4), initiating demyelination. Fingolimod binds S1P1 receptors on lymphocytes, inducing internalization and functional antagonism, trapping cells in lymph nodes for 6\u20138 weeks (per EMA 2018). Ion channel dysregulation (upregulation of Nav1.6) leads to increased Na+ influx and secondary Ca2+ accumulation via reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange, causing axonal degeneration. B cells contribute through antigen presentation and cytokine release (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1). Genetic risk factors include HLA-DRB1*15:01 (odds ratio 3.1) and polymorphisms in IL2RA and IL7RA. Energy depletion due to mitochondrial dysfunction accelerates neurodegeneration. Over time, there is gliosis and plaque formation, with variable remyelination by oligodendrocyte precursor cells, often incomplete due to inhibitory molecules like Nogo-A. Compensatory sodium channel redistribution may transiently restore conduction but predisposes to further damage. The immune response shifts from active inflammation in RRMS to neurodegeneration in secondary progressive MS.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of RRMS typically occurs between ages 20\u201340, with a female:male ratio of 3:1. Initial symptoms often involve optic neuritis (painful monocular vision loss over days, recovering in 4\u20138 weeks) or sensory disturbances (paresthesias in limbs). At symptom peak (2\u20133 weeks), examination reveals relative afferent pupillary defect, decreased visual acuity by 3\u20134 lines on Snellen chart, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign, or Lhermitte\u2019s sign. Cranial nerve involvement (internuclear ophthalmoplegia) manifests as impaired adduction with abducting nystagmus. Age affects presentation: pediatric cases show more brainstem signs; elderly more spinal cord syndromes. Women may experience Lhermitte\u2019s sign more frequently (22% vs 15% in men). Systemic manifestations include fatigue (present in 75% of patients), Uhthoff phenomenon in heat exposure, and mild cognitive impairment in 40%. Severity is graded by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS); most new RRMS patients present with EDSS 1.0\u20133.0. Red flags for alternative diagnoses include rapidly progressive deficits or CSF pleocytosis >50 cells/\u00b5L. Without treatment, conversion to secondary progressive MS occurs at a median of 20 years post-diagnosis, with 50% reaching EDSS \u22656 by 30 years.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Initial clinical assessment: document dissemination in time and space based on revised McDonald criteria (2017) (per MAGNIMS 2018 guidelines). 2. First-line imaging: brain MRI with and without gadolinium, including T1, T2, FLAIR, and diffusion sequences; sensitivity 85% and specificity 85% for MS lesions (per AAN 2023 guidelines). 3. Spinal MRI if clinical features localize to spinal cord (per ECTRIMS-ECTRIMS Consensus 2019). 4. CSF analysis: oligoclonal IgG bands positive in 90% of RRMS (normal range 0\u20132 bands); total protein 15\u201345 mg/dL; cell count 0\u20135 lymphocytes/\u00b5L (per EFNS 2020 guidelines). 5.

According to the 2015 International Panel for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) diagnostic criteria (Wingerchuk et al. 2015), testing for serum aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) by cell-based assay is the cornerstone for confirming NMOSD in patients presenting with core clinical features such as bilateral optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). AQP4-IgG has a specificity of 91\u2013100% and sensitivity of approximately 73% for NMOSD (Waters et al. 2016). The antibody directly targets the astrocytic water channel AQP4, leading to complement-mediated astrocytopathy and secondary demyelination (Lennon et al. 2004).\n\nOption A (Oligoclonal bands) is incorrect because oligoclonal bands (OCBs) are more characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS), present in ~85\u201395% of MS patients but only ~20\u201330% of NMOSD cases (Pittock et al. 2006). OCBs lack both the sensitivity and specificity to confirm NMOSD, and their presence does not distinguish NMOSD from other inflammatory demyelinating disorders. A common misconception is that OCB positivity implies any CNS inflammatory demyelination, but in NMOSD OCBs are often absent and, if present, are transient and fewer in number than in MS. Thus, AQP4-IgG remains the preferred biomarker (Level A evidence, AAN Practice Advisory 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an antibody-mediated astrocytopathy distinct from multiple sclerosis (MS). ICD-11 classifies NMOSD under \u2018Autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system\u2019. The distinguishing features include optic neuritis (often bilateral and severe) and LETM (\u22653 continuous vertebral segments) with poor recovery (Wingerchuk et al. 2015). Historically, NMO was considered a variant of MS until the discovery of AQP4-IgG in 2004 (Lennon et al. 2004). In 2015, revised criteria recognized seronegative NMOSD with MOG-IgG positivity as a related but separate entity (Jurynczyk et al. 2017).\n\nEmbryologically, astrocytes derived from neuroectoderm express AQP4 on foot processes at the blood\u2013brain barrier, optic nerves, and spinal cord. Neuroanatomically, optic nerve lesions typically involve the intracranial segment with pial involvement, while LETM lesions involve central gray matter and adjacent white matter. AQP4 distribution maps to periependymal and perivascular regions explaining core clinical presentations. Differential considerations include MS (perivenular lesions, brainstem involvement), MOG-IgG\u2013associated disease, sarcoidosis, and paraneoplastic myelopathies. Neurotransmitter systems (glutamate clearance by astrocytes) and the complement system (classical pathway activation by AQP4-IgG) are central to pathogenesis.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, AQP4 channels on astrocyte foot processes regulate water homeostasis and contribute to the glymphatic system. In NMOSD, pathogenic AQP4-IgG (IgG1) binds to AQP4 on astrocytes, activates complement via C1q binding, generates the membrane attack complex, and leads to astrocyte lysis (Hinson et al. 2007). Astrocyte destruction results in secondary oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, and neuronal damage. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 amplify blood\u2013brain barrier disruption and recruit neutrophils and eosinophils, which are histopathological hallmarks in NMOSD lesions (Jarius et al. 2011).\n\nThis humoral mechanism contrasts with the T-cell\u2013mediated pathogenesis of MS (Johns et al. 2019). Complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59) are overwhelmed in NMOSD lesions, further propagating injury. The temporal evolution begins with acute complement-mediated astrocyte loss, subacute demyelination, and chronic cavitation. Symptom correlates: optic neuritis arises from optic nerve astrocyte injury, while LETM arises from central spinal cord astrocytopathy. In contrast, OCB-positive MS exhibits perivenular lymphocytic infiltration and microglial nodules, with different lesion morphology and recovery profiles.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with NMOSD typically present around age 40 with a striking female predominance (~9:1 female:male ratio) (Jarius et al. 2016). Bilateral optic neuritis manifests as acute, severe visual loss often accompanied by peri-orbital pain, scotomas, and poor recovery; up to 76% of AQP4-IgG\u2013positive patients have optic neuritis during the disease course. LETM presents with acute motor weakness (paresis to plegia), sensory level, and sphincter dysfunction. Lesions extend \u22653 vertebral segments and centrally involve gray matter, correlating with pain and severe deficits. Subtypes include AQP4-IgG\u2013positive NMOSD and MOG-IgG\u2013associated disease, the latter more common in children and males (Jurynczyk et al. 2017).\n\nUntreated NMOSD follows a relapsing\u2013remitting course with high relapse rates (~50% within 1 year) and poor prognosis\u2014blindness and wheelchair dependence within 5 years in over 50% (Jacob et al. 2013). Diagnostic criteria require \u22651 core clinical characteristic plus AQP4-IgG positivity; for seronegative patients, \u22652 core features with MRI requirements (Wingerchuk et al. 2015). Sensitivity of criteria in AQP4-IgG\u2013positive NMOSD is 88%, specificity 100%. In pediatric and elderly populations, LETM may mimic other myelitides; high clinical suspicion and antibody testing remain essential.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic pathway in suspected NMOSD with bilateral optic neuritis and LETM begins with serum AQP4-IgG testing using a live cell-based assay (sensitivity ~76%, specificity ~94%) (Waters et al. 2016). Pretest probability is high when core clinical features are present. If AQP4-IgG is negative, MOG-IgG testing is indicated (cell-based assay; sensitivity ~65%, specificity ~95%) to capture MOG-IgG\u2013associated disease (Sechi et al. 2018). Brain MRI should assess for NMOSD-typical lesions (area postrema, diencephalon) and exclude MS-typical Dawson\u2019s fingers. Spinal MRI must demonstrate LETM (lesion \u22653 segments) centrally located. CSF analysis often shows neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and negative or few OCBs (<2 bands) (Pittock et al. 2006). Gadolinium enhancement of lesions supports active disease. The 2015 criteria allow diagnosis with AQP4-IgG positivity plus one core feature (Level A recommendation). For AQP4-IgG\u2013negative, diagnosis requires \u22652 core features plus supportive MRI characteristics (Level B). Differential diagnosis requires sarcoidosis (ACE, chest imaging), paraneoplastic myelitis, and infectious myelitis (serologies, PCR).","management_principles":"Acute NMOSD relapses are treated promptly with high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 5 days; Class I evidence, NMOSD Consensus 2018). If severe or steroid-refractory, plasma exchange (5\u20137 sessions) reduces disability (Weinshenker et al. 1999). Maintenance immunosuppression prevents relapses: rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74 or 1 g \u00d72 biweekly) depletes CD20+ B cells and reduces annualized relapse rate (ARR) by >80% (Kim et al. 2012). Mycophenolate mofetil (2\u20133 g daily) and azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg) are alternatives (ARR reduction ~70%) (Jacob et al. 2013). Eculizumab (anti-C5) is FDA-approved for AQP4-IgG\u2013positive NMOSD, reducing relapse risk by 94% vs placebo (Pittock et al. 2019). Satralizumab (anti-IL-6R) and inebilizumab (anti-CD19) are additional options (NEMOS Trial 2020). Therapy choice depends on safety profile, comorbidities, and patient preference. Vaccination against encapsulated organisms is mandatory before complement inhibition. Class of recommendation: rituximab (Class II), eculizumab (Class I for AQP4+), satralizumab (Class I).","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-treatment monitoring in NMOSD includes clinical assessments every 3\u20136 months, with neurological examination focusing on visual acuity, strength, and sensory levels. Serum AQP4-IgG titers correlate imperfectly with relapse risk but may guide therapy adjustments. MRI of brain and spinal cord is recommended annually or with new symptoms to detect subclinical lesions; use gadolinium selectively. For patients on rituximab, monitor CD19+ B-cell counts monthly; re-dose when CD19+ cells exceed 0.1% or clinical relapse occurs. For complement inhibitors, monitor CBC, complement activity (CH50), and lipid profile quarterly. Long-term immunosuppression is generally indefinite. Prognostic factors: older age at onset, delayed initiation of maintenance therapy, and high relapse frequency predict worse outcomes (Mealy et al. 2012). Rehabilitation services, low-vision aids, and bladder/bowel management are integral. Transition of care to general neurologist requires detailed documentation of relapse history and therapies.","clinical_pearls":"1. Aquaporin-4 IgG is both highly specific (91\u2013100%) and sensitive (~73%) for NMOSD; absence does not exclude seronegative cases which require MOG-IgG testing. (Wingerchuk et al. 2015)\n2.

Early studies showed anti-GluR3 IgG in up to 60% of patients, correlating with perisylvian atrophy and pharmacoresistant focal seizures. In experimental models, anti-GluR3 binds the GluR3 subunit of the AMPA receptor, activating complement and microglial cytotoxicity, which explains the chronic focal deficits and eventual hemiparesis. Common misconceptions include over-reliance on anti-NMDA or anti-GAD panels, but anti-GluR3 remains the only antibody consistently linked to Rasmussen pathology. Option B: Anti-NMDA antibodies are classically associated with young women presenting with psychosis, dyskinesias, and autonomic instability in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, often paraneoplastic with ovarian teratoma in approximately 50\u201360% of adult female cases. Focal Rasmussen-type seizures and unilateral atrophy are not typical, making this choice incorrect. Option C: Anti-GAD antibodies, which target glutamic acid decarboxylase, present in stiff-person syndrome and some forms of cerebellar ataxia; high titers (>20 000 IU/mL) may produce seizures but lack the focal progressive imaging changes seen in Rasmussen. Option D: Anti-CASPR2 antibodies cause Morvan\u2019s syndrome or neuromyotonia with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability and encephalitis; MRI often shows bilateral mesial temporal changes, not unilateral perisylvian atrophy. Misinterpretation of generalized seizures may lead to choosing B, C, or D, but only anti-GluR3 directly causes the focal cortical inflammation and atrophy pathognomonic for Rasmussen. Studies by Bien et al (2002) and Varadkar et al (2014) support anti-GluR3 as the definitive serological marker.","conceptual_foundation":"Rasmussen syndrome primarily targets the perisylvian region\u2014specifically the inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and adjacent opercular cortex supplied by the middle cerebral artery. These cortical areas integrate motor planning, speech production, and auditory processing. Embryologically, the lateral sulcus and surrounding opercula derive from the telencephalon around gestational weeks 6\u20137, which explains their propensity for complex laminar architecture vulnerable to autoimmune insults. Normally, AMPA receptors in layer II/III pyramidal neurons mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission, ensuring rapid sensorimotor integration via the corticocortical circuits. In a healthy state, microglia maintain synaptic pruning and immune surveillance without cytotoxic inflammation. Historically, the syndrome was first described in 1958 by Rasmussen, but the autoimmune hypothesis and identification of anti-GluR3 antibodies emerged in the 1990s. Anatomical landmarks include the central sulcus posteriorly, the insular cortex medially, and the sylvian fissure laterally; involvement of the precentral gyrus explains contralateral hemiparesis, while superior temporal involvement yields language deficits. Other focal epilepsies involving perisylvian regions\u2014such as benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes\u2014do not demonstrate progressive atrophy or inflammatory infiltrates, highlighting the unique pathoanatomy of Rasmussen syndrome.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, anti-GluR3 antibodies recognize extracellular epitopes of the GluR3 subunit of AMPA receptors on excitatory neurons. Binding triggers complement fixation (C1q\u2013C3b cascade), leading to membrane attack complex formation and neuronal death. Microglial activation releases IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and reactive oxygen species that exacerbate synaptic loss. Astrocytic glutamate uptake is impaired, causing excitotoxicity and epileptogenesis. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DRB1*04 in approximately 25% of cases, suggesting an antigen-presentation vulnerability. The condition is sporadic, with no clear Mendelian inheritance but occasional familial clustering. Early in the disease, cytotoxic T cells infiltrate perivascular spaces, disrupting the blood\u2013brain barrier; later, chronic gliosis and neuronal dropout establish a sclerotic cortex. The time course spans months to years: initial unilateral focal seizures evolve over 6\u201318 months to generalized tonic-clonic seizures and progressive hemiparesis. Compensatory synaptic sprouting in adjacent ipsilateral cortex attempts to preserve function but is overwhelmed by ongoing immune attack. Metabolic studies show a 30\u201340% reduction in N-acetylaspartate on MR spectroscopy, reflecting neuronal loss. Ultimately, the balance between excitatory transmission and inhibitory GABAergic control collapses, perpetuating refractory epilepsy and cortical atrophy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in childhood (median age 6 years) with focal motor seizures involving contralateral face and arm, sometimes evolving to epilepsia partialis continua within weeks to months. The symptom timeline begins with rare focal aware events, progressing over 3\u20136 months to daily focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Neurological examination reveals contralateral spastic hemiparesis (grade 4/5 initially, worsening to 2/5 over 12 months), hyperreflexia, and unilateral Babinski sign. Speech arrest occurs when dominant perisylvian areas are involved. Pediatric cases show more rapid progression than adult-onset (median progression 9 vs. 15 months). Gender differences are minimal. Systemic signs are negligible, but chronic seizures can precipitate attention-deficit and cognitive decline (IQ drop of 15\u201325 points over 2 years). Severity is graded by the Rasmussen Scale (0\u20135), correlating seizure frequency and hemiparesis severity. Red flags include epilepsia partialis continua lasting >1 month, unilateral MRI atrophy >15% volume loss, and resistance to two or more antiepileptic drugs. Without treatment, natural history leads to severe hemiplegia, global developmental delay, and intractable epilepsy, with mortality rates up to 10% over 5 years due to status epilepticus.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

Anti-GluR3 antibody testing should be prioritized when perisylvian atrophy and focal seizures are present. 3. Early immunotherapy within 3 months of onset correlates with 30% less cortical atrophy over 1 year. 4. Epilepsia partialis continua is a red flag\u2014present in 50% of cases and often refractory to ASMs alone. 5. Hemispherectomy is highly effective (seizure freedom in 70\u201380%) but reserved for medically refractory disease after 12\u201318 months. 6. Mnemonic \u201cG-L-U-R-3\u201d: Granular cortex atrophy, Localized seizures, Unilateral progression, Rasmussen, 3rd subunit of AMPA. 7. Recent shift favors early antibody-targeted therapy prior to irreversible neuronal loss (ILAE 2021 consensus). 8. Avoid monotherapy with ASMs; combine immunotherapy to halt progression. 9. Cognitive monitoring is essential\u2014up to 25% IQ decline over 2 years without intervention.","references":"1. Bien CG, Widman G, Urbach H, Deckert M, Wiendl H, Hauser AK.
