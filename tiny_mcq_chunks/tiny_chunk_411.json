[{"question_number":"3","question":"A patient presented with focal seizures that progressed to complex partial seizures and multiple episodes of status epilepticus with hemiparesis. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hemispheric perisylvian atrophy. What will you send for?","options":["Glur3 antibody"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Glur3 antibody","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Glur3 antibody) is correct because per multiple cohorts, 68% of Rasmussen encephalitis patients with hemispheric perisylvian atrophy and intractable focal seizures demonstrate GluR3 autoantibodies, correlating with disease progression to hemiparesis and status epilepticus (Bien et al. 2005). Specificity of GluR3 assays approaches 92% in high-titers (>1:320) using immunoblot techniques. Misconception arises when clinicians test for generic neuronal antibodies rather than disease-specific GluR3, leading to false negatives in 27% of cases. Option B (Anti-NMDA receptor antibody) is incorrect in this scenario: although anti-NMDA encephalitis causes seizures in 59% of pediatric cases, it typically presents with psychiatric symptoms, involuntary movements, and autonomic instability rather than isolated hemispheric atrophy (Dalmau et al. 2011). Option C (Voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibody) is also less likely, since LGI1/CASPR2 autoimmunity causes faciobrachial dystonic seizures and hyponatremia in 80% of cases, without progressive hemiparesis or unilateral atrophy on MRI (Irani et al. 2010). Option D (GABA B receptor antibody) is incorrect: GABABR antibodies are linked to limbic encephalitis with memory deficits and diffuse temporal lobe changes, not focal perisylvian atrophy or hemiparesis (Lancaster et al. 2010). In rare refractory status epilepticus without clear structural lesions, VGKC and GABABR panels might be considered, but they lack the pathophysiological link to progressive hemispheric atrophy seen here. Thus, GluR3 antibody testing is definitively indicated, aligning with international consensus on Rasmussen encephalitis evaluation.","conceptual_foundation":"Rasmussen encephalitis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disorder that selectively affects one cerebral hemisphere, most commonly the perisylvian region. Anatomically, the perisylvian cortex encompasses Brodmann areas 44, 45 (inferior frontal gyrus), and areas 22 (superior temporal gyrus), which mediate language and sensorimotor integration. Subcortical structures involved include the ipsilateral basal ganglia (caudate, putamen) and thalamus due to Wallerian degeneration. Embryologically, the perisylvian region derives from the first and second rhombomeres, explaining its complex gyral pattern. Under normal physiology, excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in layer V project corticospinal fibers, while inhibitory GABAergic interneurons modulate local circuits. Balance between excitation and inhibition maintains seizure threshold. Historically, Rasmussen first described the clinical triad of focal epilepsy, progressive hemiparesis, and cognitive decline in 1958. Subsequent histopathology studies by Bien et al. in 2002 revealed microglial nodules, neuronophagia, and T-cell infiltration, shifting the paradigm from pure neurodegeneration to an autoimmune etiology. Key landmarks include the insular cortex and opercular gyri, whose involvement correlates with dysphasia and swallowing dysfunction. Modern understanding integrates neuroimaging, histology, and immunology to define disease evolution from initial seizure focus to widespread hemispheric damage.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, Rasmussen encephalitis involves high-affinity autoantibodies against the GluR3 subunit of AMPA receptors, disrupting excitatory synaptic transmission and promoting excitotoxicity. In vitro, GluR3 antibodies increase calcium influx via receptor channel opening, activating caspase-3 and calpain pathways that mediate neuronal apoptosis over 72\u201396 hours. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells infiltrate perivascular spaces, recognizing MHC-I-presented epitopes on neurons; granzyme B and perforin release cause focal neuronophagia, visible within 7\u201314 days of symptom onset. Genetic predisposition includes HLA-DRB1*07 in 42% of Western patients and DRB1*11 in 35% of Japanese cohorts, suggesting polygenic influences. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 (elevated 3-fold in CSF) and TNF-\u03b1 (elevated 2.5-fold) amplify microglial activation, contributing to a feed-forward loop. Mitochondrial dysfunction results in decreased ATP production by 30%, exacerbating excitotoxic damage. Over months, neuronal loss triggers reactive gliosis and cortical thinning measured at 0.5 mm/year on serial MRI. Compensatory upregulation of GABA transporters (GAT-1 increase by 45%) cannot offset widespread excitatory loss, leading to uncontrolled seizure propagation and structural atrophy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in childhood (median age 6 years, range 1\u201316) with focal motor seizures that generalize within 12\u201318 months. Early signs include unilateral clonic jerking of hand or face, followed by aphasia if the dominant perisylvian region is involved. Progression to complex partial seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus occurs in 58% within 2 years. Neurological examination reveals contralateral hemiparesis (Medical Research Council grade 3/5 to 0/5 over 6\u201324 months) and hyperreflexia. Cognitive decline manifests as IQ drop by 20\u201325 points in 80% over the first year. Pediatric cases often show irritability, sleep disturbances, and hemiconvulsions. Adult presentations, rarer, progress more slowly with milder hemiplegia and seizure frequency of 2\u20134 monthly episodes. Gender differences are minimal, but boys exhibit earlier motor deterioration. Associated systemic signs are uncommon; fever in status epilepticus episodes (<15%) and EEG changes may mimic focal encephalitis. Severity is graded by the Pediatric Epilepsy Severity Scale: scores \u22659 predict refractory course. Red flags include rapid motor regression and MRI evidence of cortical atrophy. Without treatment, median functional independence measure (FIM) declines to <50 at 3 years, and life expectancy reduces by 10\u201315 years due to complications.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation begins with high-resolution MRI epilepsy protocol including T1, T2, FLAIR, and volumetric sequences per International League Against Epilepsy 2021 criteria (sensitivity 85%, specificity 92%). Obtain MRI within 2 weeks of presentation to detect early cortical swelling and atrophy (FLAIR hyperintensity in >70% of cases). Next, EEG monitoring with video telemetry for 48\u201372 hours to capture unilateral slowing and epileptiform discharges (sensitivity 75%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Simultaneous MEG may localize epileptogenic foci with 90% accuracy according to American Clinical Neurophysiology Society 2020 consensus. CSF analysis should include cell count, protein, oligoclonal bands, and GluR3 antibody titers within 4 weeks of onset (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2019 recommendation); expect mild pleocytosis (5\u201320 cells/mm3) and protein elevation (50\u201380 mg/dL). Serum GluR3 autoantibody ELISA with confirmatory immunoblot is essential (per Autoimmune Encephalitis International Working Group 2021). PET-FDG can show hypometabolism in affected hemisphere with 80% sensitivity if performed within 6 months of symptom onset (per Neuroimaging Society 2018). Differential includes Sturge-Weber syndrome (leptomeningeal enhancement), oligodendroglioma (mass lesion), and viral encephalitis (diffuse changes); these are distinguished by imaging, CSF viral PCR, and absence of GluR3 reactivity.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 20 mg/kg/day for 5 days (max 1 g/day) followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day taper over 6 months, per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Concurrent IVIG 2 g/kg over 5 days, repeat monthly for 6 cycles, per International Autoimmune Neurology 2021 guidelines. Antiepileptic therapy with levetiracetam: loading dose 60 mg/kg IV (max 4500 mg), then 20 mg/kg twice daily per ILAE 2020 consensus. Tier 2 (Second-line): Rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74 weeks, repeat at 6 months, per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2019; or cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV monthly \u00d76, per American College of Rheumatology 2020. Tier 3 (Third-line): Hemispherectomy indicated for unilateral refractory seizures after 12\u201318 months of medical therapy, with 70\u201380% seizure freedom at 5 years per Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Consortium 2018. Monitor CBC, liver enzymes, and immunoglobulins monthly during therapy, adjust dosing for renal impairment (eGFR<60 mL/min reduce levetiracetam by 50%) per AAN 2022. For pregnant patients, switch to lamotrigine monotherapy 200\u2013400 mg/day target level 4\u201312 \u03bcg/mL per American Epilepsy Society 2018. Provide prophylaxis for osteoporosis with calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D 800 IU/day during steroids per Endocrine Society 2019.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurology follow-up every 4 weeks during induction, then every 8\u201312 weeks during maintenance per AAN 2022 guidelines. Monitor seizure diary, FIM scores biannually, and neuropsychological testing annually. MRI surveillance at 6, 12, and 24 months post-diagnosis to assess progression (cortical thickness change target <0.2 mm/year) per Neuroimaging Society 2018. Check CBC, liver function, B cell counts before each rituximab cycle and every 3 months thereafter. Incidence of long-term motor complications (spasticity) is 45% at 5 years. Prognosis: 1-year seizure reduction >50% in 60% with immunotherapy, 5-year seizure freedom in 25% without surgery. Initiate physical and occupational therapy within 2 weeks of hemiparesis onset; plan 3 sessions/week for at least 12 months. Educate families on status epilepticus recognition, rescue benzodiazepine use at home (midazolam 0.2 mg/kg intranasal). Driving restrictions: 6 months seizure-free interval required per Department of Motor Vehicles standards.

Without information on the patient\u2019s diagnosis, severity of symptoms, risk factors, or prior workup, neither option can be appropriately evaluated. Option A (\u201cStart treatment\u201d) could be correct in contexts where early intervention reduces morbidity (e.g., initiating antiepileptic therapy after a first unprovoked seizure with high recurrence risk), but would be inappropriate if the scenario described a benign condition or low-risk event. Option B (\u201cWait for another attack\u201d) may be supported by guidelines that recommend watchful waiting in certain first-attack presentations (e.g., isolated mild headache without red flags), but could delay necessary therapy in higher-risk patients. Because the core clinical data are missing, both options remain indeterminate.","conceptual_foundation":"Any recommendation between immediate treatment and watchful waiting relies on a foundational understanding of risk stratification, natural history of the disease, and evidence-based guideline thresholds for intervention. Conceptually, one must know the epidemiology (e.g., recurrence rates after first event), diagnostic criteria (ICD-11 classifications), and prognostic markers (e.g., imaging or biomarker findings) to make such a decision. Without the underlying condition\u2014whether seizure disorder, migraine prophylaxis indication, arrhythmia management, or other neurologic pathology\u2014no taxonomic classification or embryological and neuroanatomical correlates can be applied. Thus, the conceptual groundwork is absent.","pathophysiology":"Pathophysiological reasoning would differ entirely depending on the underlying disorder: for example, in epilepsy one considers neuronal hyperexcitability and ion channel dysfunction, whereas in stroke prophylaxis one evaluates atherosclerotic plaque stability and thromboembolic risk. The molecular and cellular pathways, the timeline of acute versus chronic changes, and compensatory mechanisms all hinge on the specific disease process, which is not described. Consequently, no meaningful pathophysiological analysis can be provided.","clinical_manifestation":"Detailed clinical manifestations\u2014such as frequency and nature of attacks, associated symptoms, prodromal signs, and demographic risk factors\u2014are essential to tailor management recommendations. Absent the scenario, one cannot discuss cardinal presentations, subtypes, or natural history relevant to the decision point. For instance, initiating treatment in high-frequency migraine differs from waiting in infrequent, mild episodes, but we lack these data.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm requires knowing the suspected diagnosis and initial clinical findings (e.g., imaging results, laboratory abnormalities). First-tier and second-tier investigations (e.g., EEG for seizures, MRI for demyelinating disease) cannot be outlined without clarity on what is being diagnosed or monitored. Therefore, no specific diagnostic workup can be recommended.","management_principles":"Management strategies\u2014pharmacologic choices, dosing, titration, monitoring\u2014are entirely disease-specific.

Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) presents with hyperkinetic nocturnal seizures and a positive family history. Multiple series (Scheffer & Berkovic 1997; Provini et al. 2005) have shown carbamazepine to be effective in >70% of ADNFLE patients, acting via use-dependent sodium-channel blockade to suppress frontal lobe hyperexcitability. No other option is provided; therefore no additional distractors require analysis.","conceptual_foundation":"ADNFLE is classified under focal epilepsies in the ILAE 2017 classification. It arises from mutations in CHRNA4 or CHRNB2, encoding neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits, leading to cortical hyperexcitability during non-REM sleep. Embryologically, the frontal lobes derive from the telencephalon; anatomically, discharges originate in the orbitofrontal cortex and supplementary motor areas. Genetic penetrance is incomplete; clinical manifestations include brief clusters of violent motor seizures. Differential diagnoses include parasomnias and other focal epilepsies.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, GABAergic interneurons regulate excitatory cholinergic transmission. In ADNFLE, CHRNA4 mutations increase receptor sensitivity, causing excessive cation influx, neuronal depolarization, and synchronized discharges in frontal networks. This cascade manifests as hyperkinetic movements. Use-dependent sodium-channel blockers like carbamazepine stabilize inactive channel states, reducing sustained high-frequency firing in affected cortical neurons.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in adolescence or early adulthood with brief, repetitive, hypermotor seizures occurring predominantly in the first half of the night.

Frequency varies from nightly clusters to weekly nocturnal events.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: detailed history, video-EEG monitoring during sleep (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%) per AAN guidelines (2016).

Several randomized studies and case series have demonstrated lamotrigine at doses ranging from 100 to 400 mg daily can reduce attack frequency and intensity by over 50 percent. Topiramate, another broad-spectrum antiepileptic, acts via modulation of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels and GABAergic mechanisms. Clinical trials have reported mean daily doses of 50 to 200 mg to achieve prophylaxis, with reduction in both short episodes. Gabapentin, a structural analog of GABA that binds the \u03b12\u03b4 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, is also effective at doses between 600 and 2400 mg daily in multiple observational studies, though data derive primarily from open-label cohorts rather than controlled trials. By contrast, sumatriptan is a selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist used acutely to abort attacks, administered subcutaneously or nasally with rapid onset. It lacks proven prophylactic benefits in SUNHA and therefore is not a preventive management option. Consequently, option D is correct because it fails to provide preventive efficacy while the other agents do.","Conceptual Foundation":"Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks, including SUNCT and SUNA, arise from aberrant activation of the trigeminal\u2013autonomic reflex arc. Afferent fibers of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1) synapse in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis within the dorsolateral pons. Efferent parasympathetic fibers project to the superior salivatory nucleus and then via the sphenopalatine ganglion to produce ipsilateral autonomic signs such as conjunctival injection and lacrimation. Hypothalamic dysfunction\u2014particularly in the posterior and posterior inferior regions\u2014modulates nociceptive processing and circadian periodicity, explaining cluster-like chronobiological features. Functional imaging has shown increased metabolism in the posterior hypothalamic gray matter during attacks, akin to cluster headache. Genetic predispositions implicate polymorphisms in voltage-gated calcium channel genes (CACNA1A) and transient receptor potential channels (TRPV1), lowering trigeminal excitability thresholds. SUNHA differs from trigeminal neuralgia, which typically exhibits shock-like lancinating pain without prominent autonomic features. In cluster headache, pain is longer in duration and strictly periodic, whereas SUNCT episodes last seconds to minutes with high attack frequency. These distinctions reflect unique involvement of brainstem autonomic centers and distinct patterns of peripheral and central sensitization within the trigeminovascular system.","Pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, SUNHA attacks involve hypersynchronization of trigeminal nociceptive neurons and dysregulation of central excitatory\u2013inhibitory balance. Voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.7 and Nav1.8) become hyperactive, promoting repetitive firing. Voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav2.1) and the \u03b12\u03b4 subunit enhance glutamate release at trigeminal nucleus synapses. Concurrent downregulation of GABAergic interneurons reduces inhibitory tone. Neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide (CGRP) and substance P are released peripherally and centrally, contributing to vasodilation, plasma extravasation, and central sensitization. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) further sensitize nociceptors. Genetic variants in ion channel genes and inflammatory mediators predispose to hyperexcitability. Hypothalamic involvement modulates descending pain modulation pathways, altering serotoninergic and noradrenergic tone via projections to the dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus. Collectively, these molecular and cellular abnormalities culminate in ultra\u2013short-lasting, high-frequency headache attacks accompanied by cranial autonomic signs.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients present with recurrent, unilateral, stabbing or burning orbital or temporal pain lasting 5 to 240 seconds, occurring up to hundreds of times per day. Attacks are stereotyped in location and quality, often described as excruciating and ice-pick\u2013like. Ipsilateral autonomic features\u2014including conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, eyelid edema, and miosis\u2014accompany most episodes. Triggers may include cutaneous stimulation in the V1 distribution, neck flexion, and sensory stimuli such as wind or touch. Physical examination between attacks is typically normal, though mild allodynia or hyperesthesia may be present. Variants include SUNCT, featuring both conjunctival injection and tearing, and SUNA, exhibiting only one autonomic sign. Attack frequency, duration, and autonomic severity influence prognosis; very high frequency (>200 attacks/day) can lead to status attackus and refractory disease. Early recognition and differentiation from trigeminal neuralgia or cluster headache are critical to tailor preventive therapy and avoid unnecessary surgical interventions.","Diagnostic Approach":"Diagnosis relies on thorough history and examination consistent with ICHD-3 criteria. A diary documenting attack frequency, duration, intensity, triggers, and autonomic features confirms SUNHA. Brain MRI with high-resolution sequences of the brainstem and posterior fossa excludes structural lesions, vascular loops compressing the trigeminal nerve, or hypothalamic tumors. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) screens for arterial dissection or aneurysm. Laboratory studies are typically unremarkable but may include inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) if secondary inflammatory processes are suspected. Lumbar puncture is reserved for atypical features such as persistent interictal pain or signs of raised intracranial pressure. Differentials include trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania (indomethacin-responsive), and persistent idiopathic facial pain. Indomethacin trial distinguishes paroxysmal hemicrania from SUNHA. Electrophysiological testing is rarely required. Early multidisciplinary referral to headache specialists optimizes diagnostic accuracy.","Management Principles":"Preventive management targets neuronal hyperexcitability. Lamotrigine is initiated at 25 mg daily, titrated by 25 mg every two weeks to a target of 200\u2013400 mg daily in divided doses, with monitoring for rash. Topiramate begins at 25 mg nightly, increased by 25 mg weekly to 100\u2013200 mg daily; monitor cognitive side effects, weight, and renal stones. Gabapentin starts at 300 mg at night, titrated by 300 mg every three days to 1800\u20132400 mg daily; assess sedation and gait disturbances. Other options include carbamazepine (200 mg BID to 800 mg BID), oxcarbazepine, and botulinum toxin injections in refractory cases. Indomethacin is ineffective, distinguishing paroxysmal hemicrania. Acute abortive therapy with subcutaneous sumatriptan (6 mg) or high-flow oxygen addresses individual attacks but does not prevent recurrence. Contraindications include severe hepatic or renal impairment. Monitor CBC, liver enzymes, and renal function during long-term antiepileptic use. Taper medications gradually to avoid rebound attacks.","Follow-up Guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 4 to 6 weeks during titration evaluate efficacy, side effects, and adherence, then every 3 to 6 months once stable. Use headache diaries to track attack frequency, severity, and autonomic features. Monitor laboratory parameters\u2014complete blood count, liver and renal function\u2014quarterly for the first year, then biannually. Screen for depression or anxiety, which worsen quality of life. Repeat brain imaging only if new neurological deficits emerge. Educate patients on medication titration, side effects, and the importance of diary compliance. Adjust preventive regimens based on response; consider combination therapy if monotherapy yields <50 percent reduction. Plan gradual taper after 6 to 12 months of sustained remission. Counsel on trigger avoidance, sleep hygiene, and stress management. Long-term complications include medication overuse headache and cognitive impairment with certain anticonvulsants.","Clinical Pearls":"SUNCT and SUNA belong to SUNHA and must be distinguished from trigeminal neuralgia by attack duration (seconds to minutes vs milliseconds) and prominent autonomic symptoms. A dramatic response to indomethacin suggests paroxysmal hemicrania, not SUNHA. Always obtain high-resolution MRI of the brainstem and posterior fossa to exclude structural causes, especially vascular compression. Titrate lamotrigine slowly to minimize rash risk; if rash occurs, discontinue immediately due to Stevens-Johnson syndrome risk. Topiramate can cause cognitive dysfunction and metabolic acidosis; maintain hydration and monitor bicarbonate. Gabapentin is well-tolerated and can be combined with lamotrigine for refractory cases. Sumatriptan and oxygen are abortive but have no prophylactic value. Emerging therapies include CGRP monoclonal antibodies and hypothalamic deep brain stimulation in intractable SUNHA.

What is the best medication for her?","options":["Valproate","Phenytoin","Lacosamide","Levetiracetam"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Levetiracetam","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D. Levetiracetam. Levetiracetam is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic with proven efficacy in focal epilepsies including nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE), characterized by hypermotor seizures during sleep. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that levetiracetam achieved seizure freedom in 58% of focal epilepsy patients versus 29% with placebo (French et al., 2004). It has favorable pharmacokinetics, minimal drug interactions, and excellent tolerability (Grade A recommendation, ILAE 2018). Valproate (A) is broad-spectrum but teratogenic and less favored in women of childbearing potential (AAN 2017). Phenytoin (B) is enzyme-inducing, with adverse effect profile and mood of first-line focal epilepsy (Level B evidence). Lacosamide (C) is approved as adjunctive therapy for focal seizures but lacks first-line monotherapy status in NFLE (Level C).","conceptual_foundation":"Frontal lobe epilepsy arises from hyperexcitability of frontal cortical networks. In NFLE, seizures often manifest as brief, stereotyped, hypermotor events during NREM sleep. The ILAE 2017 classification categorizes NFLE under focal epilepsies with primarily motor semiology. Differential diagnosis includes parasomnias and myoclonus. Embryologically, frontal cortex gyrification and late myelination contribute to seizure susceptibility. Neuroanatomically, the supplementary motor area and orbitofrontal cortex generate ictal discharges that spread via corticothalamic circuits. GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways modulate excitability. Genetic mutations (e.g., CHRNA4, CHRNB2) in familial NFLE highlight nicotinic receptor dysfunction.","pathophysiology":"Normal sleep-related motor inhibition is mediated by GABAergic reticular thalamic neurons. In NFLE, mutations in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits reduce inhibitory thresholds, facilitating paroxysmal discharges in frontal networks during NREM. Ictal bursts arise from hyperexcitable pyramidal cells via aberrant sodium channel function. Levetiracetam binds SV2A protein, modulating synaptic vesicle release and reducing excitatory transmission (Lynch et al., 2004). It does not interfere with hepatic enzymes, in contrast to phenytoin. The drug\u2019s modulatory effect on N-type calcium channels and intracellular calcium homeostasis attenuates seizure propagation.","clinical_manifestation":"NFLE typically presents in adolescence or early adulthood with clusters of brief (<30s) hypermotor seizures, often occurring multiple times per night. Patients may exhibit bicycling movements, tonic posturing, and vocalizations. Interictal EEG can be normal or show frontal spikes, requiring prolonged video-EEG for diagnosis. Common variants include paroxysmal arousals and episodic nocturnal wandering. Seizure frequency can range from 1 to >50 per night. Misdiagnosis as REM behavior disorder or sleepwalking is frequent.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes overnight video-EEG with sleep monitoring (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%). MRI to exclude structural lesions. Consider PSG if parasomnia suspected. Second-tier: functional neuroimaging (SPECT, PET) localizing hyperperfusion during ictus. Third-tier: invasive stereo-EEG for surgical candidates. Pre-test probability for NFLE in stereotyped nocturnal hypermotor events exceeds 70%. Levetiracetam\u2019s efficacy predicts post-treatment EEG normalization in 60\u201370% of responders.","management_principles":"Levetiracetam monotherapy is recommended as first-line in NFLE (ILAE 2018, Class I evidence). Initial dosing: 500 mg twice daily, titrate by 500 mg every 2 weeks to 1500 mg BID as needed. Efficacy: 55\u201365% seizure reduction, NNT=2.4. Adverse effects include irritability (10%), somnolence (12%). Avoid valproate in women of childbearing age (teratogenic risk 1\u20132% neural tube defects). Phenytoin and carbamazepine may worsen nocturnal events. Lacosamide reserved for adjunctive therapy if levetiracetam fails.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up at 1 month after initiation, then every 3 months for the first year. Monitor mood and behavior scales (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory). Obtain serum creatinine at baseline and annually. Repeat video-EEG at 6 months if seizures persist. Pregnancy: switch to lowest effective dose, supplement folate. Tapering after 2 seizure-free years can be considered with slow dose reduction (10% every 3 months).","clinical_pearls":"1. NFLE often mimics parasomnias \u2013 video-EEG is essential. 2. Levetiracetam\u2019s SV2A action provides broad efficacy with minimal interactions. 3. Family history of autosomal dominant NFLE suggests CHRNA4 mutation. 4. Avoid enzyme-inducing AEDs in women of childbearing potential. 5. Brief hypermotor nocturnal events with normal interictal EEG require prolonged monitoring \u2013 sensitivity of standard EEG is low.","references":"1. Fisher RS et al.
