What should be given?","options":["Aspirin","Warfarin","Factor X inhibitor"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Factor X inhibitor","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option C (Factor X inhibitor) is correct. In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) targeting factor Xa (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban) have demonstrated noninferiority to warfarin in large randomized trials (ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE) with significantly lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage. The ROCKET-AF trial showed a hazard ratio of 0.79 (95% CI 0.65\u20130.95) for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin, with a 50% reduction in intracranial bleeding (N Engl J Med 2011;365:883\u201391). Option A (aspirin) is inadequate for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AFFIRM Trial, stroke rate 3.8% per year). Option B (warfarin) is effective but is now second-line to DOACs due to need for monitoring, drug and dietary interactions, and greater hemorrhage risk (AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines).","conceptual_foundation":"Cardioembolic stroke falls under the TOAST classification as a major etiologic subtype. Atrial fibrillation causes stasis in the left atrial appendage, promoting thrombus formation. Nonvalvular AFF arises in the absence of rheumatic mitral stenosis or prosthetic heart valves (ICD-11 LA84). Differential includes carotid atherosclerosis and small-vessel disease. Historically, warfarin was the standard of care after the 1990 SPAF trials; molecular insights into factor Xa catalysis led to development of DOACs. The pathway targeted is the common coagulation cascade, specifically the convergence of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways at factor X.","pathophysiology":"Normal hemostasis involves sequential activation of clotting factors culminating in thrombin-mediated conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. In atrial fibrillation, loss of organized atrial contraction leads to blood stasis in the left atrium, particularly the left atrial appendage. This stasis triggers the intrinsic pathway, generating factor Xa and thrombin. Factor Xa inhibitors selectively block the active site of factor Xa, preventing thrombin generation and subsequent clot formation. Compared with vitamin K antagonists, DOACs avoid fluctuations due to vitamin K intake, and have a more predictable pharmacodynamic profile.","clinical_manifestation":"Cardioembolic stroke presents acutely with maximal neurologic deficit at onset, often with cortical signs such as aphasia, neglect, or visual field cut. Systemic emboli (renal, mesenteric) may co-occur. Without anticoagulation, risk of recurrent embolism in atrial fibrillation is approximately 4\u201312% per year. DOACs reduce this by 60\u201370%. Identification of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation via ECG and transesophageal echocardiogram is key. Patients are stratified by CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc score; a score \u22652 in men or \u22653 in women indicates anticoagulation.","diagnostic_approach":"Stroke evaluation includes brain imaging (CT/MRI) to confirm ischemia and exclude hemorrhage, ECG monitoring for atrial fibrillation, echocardiography to identify cardiac sources, and vascular imaging to exclude large-vessel stenosis. In nonvalvular AFF, transesophageal echocardiography is reserved for cryptogenic cases. Laboratory tests include renal and hepatic function to guide DOAC dosing. Pretest probability of cardioembolism is assessed by clinical history and imaging; high probability warrants immediate anticoagulation.","management_principles":"Initiate factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., apixaban 5 mg BID or rivaroxaban 20 mg QD) in nonvalvular AFF once hemorrhagic transformation risk is low (typically 3\u20135 days post-stroke for moderate infarcts). Class I recommendation (AHA/ASA 2019). Adjust dose for renal impairment (CrCl 15\u201350 mL/min). Monitor renal function every 6 months. No routine coagulation monitoring is required. Reversal agents include andexanet alfa for life-threatening bleeding. Aspirin alone is not adequate; warfarin (INR 2\u20133) is an alternative when DOACs are contraindicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess renal function and adherence at 3 and 6 months, then annually. Monitor for bleeding (CBC, fecal occult blood annually). Neurologic follow-up at 1 month post-discharge and then every 3\u20136 months. Evaluate for falls or other bleeding risks. Long-term anticoagulation is recommended indefinitely unless major contraindications arise. Coordinate with cardiology for rate/rhythm control of atrial fibrillation.","clinical_pearls":"1. In nonvalvular AFF, DOACs are preferred over warfarin due to lower ICH risk. 2. Factor Xa inhibitors require renal dosing adjustments; check eGFR before initiation. 3. Aspirin provides insufficient protection against cardioembolic stroke. 4. Delay anticoagulation 3\u20135 days after moderate stroke to reduce hemorrhagic conversion. 5. Andexanet alfa is approved for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors in life-threatening bleeds.","references":"1. Patel MR et al. Rivaroxaban versus warfarin in nonvalvular AF.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Amyloid","Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT)","Anticoagulation use"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Anticoagulation use","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C. Anticoagulation use. Hemorrhages with fluid levels on non\u2010contrast CT scans reflect the hematocrit effect, where red blood cells settle in plasma, forming a horizontal fluid\u2013fluid interface. Multiple cohort studies report fluid levels in 4\u201313% of anticoagulation\u2010associated intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH), correlating with active bleeding and hematoma expansion risk. Option A (Amyloid) is incorrect because cerebral amyloid angiopathy produces lobar hemorrhages without fluid\u2013fluid levels; these are due to \u03b2\u2010amyloid deposition in vessel walls, leading to multifocal cortical hemorrhages and superficial siderosis, not the hematocrit effect. Option B (Cerebral Venous Thrombosis) is incorrect because venous thrombosis causes hemorrhagic infarction with gyriform bleeding and edema, not well-defined fluid\u2013fluid levels. Thus, the presence of a hematocrit sign strongly implicates anticoagulation use.","conceptual_foundation":"Fluid\u2013fluid levels in intracranial hemorrhages arise when impaired clot formation permits red cell sedimentation within a hematoma cavity. In ICD-11, ICH due to anticoagulation is coded 7A01.06. Chronic subdural hematomas and other bleeds can layer, but in anticoagulated ICH, persistent bleeding and impaired fibrin clot formation yield the classic fluid\u2013fluid interface. The phenomenon was first described in the 1980s, with specificity for coagulopathy established in studies of warfarin\u2010associated ICH in the early 2000s. This concept integrates vascular injury, coagulation biology, and CT imaging physics.","pathophysiology":"Normal hemostasis involves platelet adhesion and thrombin\u2010mediated fibrin clot formation. Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin inhibiting vitamin K\u2013dependent factors or direct oral anticoagulants inhibiting factor Xa or thrombin) disrupt fibrin generation. Continued hemorrhage allows red blood cells to settle under gravity, separating from plasma and creating a fluid\u2013fluid level. In cerebral amyloid angiopathy, vessel fragility arises from \u03b2\u2010amyloid deposition, but intact coagulation produces clots without layering. In CVT, venous outflow obstruction causes capillary rupture and hemorrhagic infarction, but not the hematocrit effect.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients on anticoagulation presenting with ICH exhibit acute headache, nausea, vomiting, focal deficits, and depressed consciousness. Warfarin\u2010associated ICH carries mortality >50% if not reversed. Fluid levels occur in 4\u201313% of these cases, often when INR exceeds 2.5. No specific prodrome exists, though transient neurological symptoms may precede full hemorrhage in some anticoagulated patients.","diagnostic_approach":"Non\u2010contrast CT head (sensitivity ~100% for acute ICH) reveals hyperdense hematoma with horizontal fluid level. The hematocrit sign has specificity ~95% and sensitivity ~10% for anticoagulation\u2010related hemorrhage. Laboratory evaluation includes INR, PT/aPTT, and platelet count. Elevated INR (>3.0) confers an odds ratio of ~2.5 (95% CI 1.8\u20133.6) for fluid levels. CT angiography can detect the spot sign (contrast extravasation) in ~30% of ICH, with positive predictive value ~77% for hematoma expansion.","management_principles":"Immediate anticoagulation reversal is essential. For warfarin: prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) plus intravenous vitamin K (Class I, Level A; AHA/ASA 2015). For dabigatran: idarucizumab 5 g IV (Class I, Level A; AHA/ASA 2016). For factor Xa inhibitors: andexanet alfa (Class IIa, Level B). Blood pressure control targeting systolic <140 mmHg using IV labetalol or nicardipine (Class I, Level A). Neurosurgical evaluation for hematoma evacuation if volume >30 mL or causing mass effect.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat CT at 6\u201324 hours to assess hematoma expansion. Resume anticoagulation based on thromboembolic versus hemorrhagic risk; current AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend delaying restart for 4\u20138 weeks in high\u2010thrombotic\u2010risk patients (e.g., mechanical valves, CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc \u22654). Long\u2010term blood pressure control per secondary stroke prevention guidelines is mandatory.","clinical_pearls":"1. Fluid\u2013fluid levels on CT indicate coagulopathy, most often anticoagulation. 2. The hematocrit sign is highly specific (~95%) but not sensitive (~10%). 3. Rapid warfarin reversal with PCC reduces hematoma expansion and mortality. 4. CTA spot sign predicts hematoma growth; consider when evaluating surgical candidacy. 5. Differentiate from chronic subdural layering by hematoma shape and clinical history.","references":"1. Hemphill JC 3rd et al. Guidelines for the Management of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.

The risk of rupture of an anterior communicating artery (ACom) aneurysm strongly correlates with aneurysm diameter: aneurysms \u22657 mm have a 2\u20134% annual rupture risk versus <0.5% for those <5 mm (ISUIA Study, 2003). Option B (smoking) is an important modifiable risk factor for aneurysm formation and growth but is less predictive of imminent rupture than aneurysm size.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracranial saccular (\u2018berry\u2019) aneurysms arise at arterial bifurcations, most commonly the ACom (~30%). They are classified by size (small <7 mm, large \u22657 mm, giant >25 mm) and morphology (saccular vs fusiform). Risk factors include hypertension, smoking, and genetic connective tissue disorders (e.g., polycystic kidney disease). Historical natural history studies (ISUIA) established size as primary rupture predictor.","pathophysiology":"Wall shear stress at bifurcations leads to endothelial dysfunction and degradation of the internal elastic lamina. As aneurysms enlarge, wall tension increases per Laplace\u2019s law (tension \u221d radius \u00d7 pressure), predisposing to rupture. Smoking contributes via inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase activation, but without size increase the acute rupture risk remains low.","clinical_manifestation":"Unruptured ACom aneurysms are often asymptomatic or may cause visual field deficits via optic chiasm compression. Rupture presents with sudden severe headache (\u2018thunderclap\u2019), meningeal signs, and risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with 15% early mortality. Incidental small aneurysms rarely cause symptoms.","diagnostic_approach":"Noninvasive screening with CTA or MRA identifies aneurysm size and morphology. Digital subtraction angiography remains gold standard for surgical planning. Size measurement is critical: reproducibility within 1 mm. Screening recommended in high-risk groups (family history, polycystic kidney disease).","management_principles":"For aneurysms \u22657 mm in the anterior circulation, prophylactic repair (clipping or coiling) is class IIa recommendation (AHA/ASA 2015). Smaller aneurysms (<7 mm) are managed conservatively with risk factor modification (blood pressure control, smoking cessation) and imaging surveillance every 6\u201312 months.","follow_up_guidelines":"Surveillance imaging at 6 months post-diagnosis and then yearly if stable. Monitor blood pressure and counsel on smoking cessation. Reassess treatment threshold if aneurysm enlarges by >1 mm.","clinical_pearls":"1. ACom aneurysm rupture risk rises sharply above 7 mm diameter. 2. Smoking cessation reduces aneurysm growth but does not eliminate rupture risk in large aneurysms. 3. SAH presents with sudden worst headache of life and requires emergent CT. 4. CTA sensitivity for aneurysms \u22653 mm is >95%. 5.
