[{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient presented with progressive inability to drink with a straw, proximal weakness, scapular winging, and impaired foot dorsiflexion. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy","Limb girdle muscular dystrophy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy) is correct. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) classically presents with early-onset facial weakness (difficulty drinking through a straw), scapular winging due to periscapular muscle involvement, and lower extremity involvement affecting the tibialis anterior leading to impaired dorsiflexion and foot drop. In contrast, Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) primarily involves proximal limb muscles without predominant facial involvement or striking scapular winging in early disease. The key distinguishing features\u2014facial weakness with straw\u2010drinking difficulty, scapular winging, and tibialis anterior weakness\u2014are hallmark findings in FSHD and not typical of LGMD. Common misconceptions include attributing scapular winging purely to shoulder girdle involvement in LGMD, but true scapular winging with facial muscle involvement is far more specific for FSHD.","conceptual_foundation":"Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy is a genetic muscular dystrophy transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, linked to contraction of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat on chromosome 4q35. It fits into the ICD-11 group \u2018Muscular dystrophies and other myopathies\u2019. Differential diagnoses include LGMD, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, and mitochondrial myopathies. Embryologically, development of facial and scapular muscles arises from cranial and somitic mesoderm, explaining the selective vulnerability in FSHD. The DUX4 gene, normally silenced, becomes aberrantly expressed due to hypomethylation, leading to muscle cell toxicity. The disorder illustrates the shift from simple dystrophinopathies to epigenetic regulation disorders in current nosology.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle physiology relies on intact sarcolemmal architecture with appropriate gene expression. In FSHD, contraction of the D4Z4 repeats leads to derepression of the DUX4 transcription factor, inducing cytotoxic cascades including oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine release, and apoptotic myofiber death. This results in chronic loss of facial and scapular muscle fibers, progressive weakness, and eventual fatty infiltration. Unlike LGMD, which involves structural protein defects in the sarcoglycan or dysferlin complexes, FSHD is a toxic gain\u2010of\u2010function at the molecular level with epigenetic dysregulation as the primary driver.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with FSHD typically present in the second decade with asymmetric facial weakness\u2014unable to whistle or drink from a straw\u2014progressing to scapular winging and humeral region weakness. Lower limb involvement emerges later, particularly in the tibialis anterior, manifesting as foot drop. Severity varies widely, with some remaining ambulatory into late adulthood. In untreated natural history cohorts, 70% maintain independent ambulation at 40 years of age. Diagnostic criteria emphasize facial muscles (orbicularis oculi and oris) and scapular fixators, with foot dorsiflexion involvement as a supportive feature.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing includes clinical examination demonstrating the characteristic pattern and family history. Creatine kinase levels are modestly elevated (typically <1,000 IU/L). Genetic testing via Southern blot or molecular assays confirms D4Z4 contraction on chromosome 4q35. Electromyography shows myopathic motor unit potentials with early recruitment. Muscle MRI may illustrate selective fat infiltration. LGMD is ruled out by absence of genetic defects in sarcoglycan, dysferlin, and other related genes.","management_principles":"There is no cure; management is supportive. Physical therapy focuses on stretching periscapular muscles and maintaining gait. Orthotic devices (ankle\u2013foot orthoses) address foot drop. Scapular fixation surgery may improve arm elevation. Pain management includes NSAIDs and stretching. Cardiac and respiratory monitoring are not routinely required unless symptomatic.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up visits every 6\u201312 months with functional assessments (e.g., 6\u2010minute walk test), pulmonary function tests annually after age 20, and orthopedic evaluation for scapular fixation candidacy. Monitor for progressive decline in walking distance and activities of daily living.","clinical_pearls":"1. Difficulty drinking through a straw is a red flag for facial muscle involvement in FSHD. 2. Scapular winging in a young adult with facial weakness almost always indicates FSHD over LGMD. 3. Foot drop in FSHD arises from tibialis anterior involvement, not distal neuropathy. 4. Genetic testing for D4Z4 contraction is diagnostic\u2014no muscle biopsy needed if positive. 5. Asymmetry of weakness is more pronounced in FSHD versus symmetrical LGMD.","references":"1.

He has siblings with the same problem, and his parents are related. electromyography (EMG) findings are not available, and CK levels are 2800. What is the chance that the patient will pass the disease to his offspring?","options":["50% normal","25% normal","25% carrier","50% affected"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The clinical presentation\u2014proximal lower-limb weakness since childhood, elevated CK (~2,800 IU/L), consanguinity, and multiple affected siblings\u2014strongly suggests an autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. In autosomal recessive inheritance, an affected individual (aa) mated with a non-carrier partner (AA) will produce 100% heterozygous carriers (Aa) and 0% affected offspring. None of the provided options (A: 50% normal; B: 25% normal; C: 25% carrier; D: 50% affected) correctly describes this scenario. Option A (50% normal) and B (25% normal) underestimate the carrier rate; option C (25% carrier) incorrectly applies a carrier risk from two heterozygotes, not an affected/normal cross; option D (50% affected) wrongly implies a 50% risk of disease transmission, which does not occur when one parent is homozygous recessive and the other is homozygous wild-type. This classical Mendelian outcome (100% carriers, 0% affected) is well established in genetic texts (Griffiths et al. 2015).","conceptual_foundation":"Autosomal recessive (AR) disorders require two mutant alleles for phenotype expression. In AR limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD), mutations in genes encoding sarcolemmal or cytoskeletal proteins lead to muscle fiber degeneration. ICD-11 classifies LGMD under rare hereditary myopathies (MG01.130). Differential diagnoses include Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophies (X-linked), inflammatory myopathies, and metabolic myopathies. Historically, LGMD subtypes (LGMD1 autosomal dominant vs LGMD2 autosomal recessive) were delineated by inheritance pattern; current nosology uses the gene symbol (e.g., LGMD2A = CAPN3 deficiency). Embryologically, muscle fiber integrity depends on extracellular matrix-cytoskeleton linkage mediated by the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex; genetic defects disrupt this, as first described by Hoffman et al. in the 1980s. Key neuroanatomical structures include proximal limb girdle musculature (pelvic and shoulder girdles) innervated by spinal motor neurons via peripheral nerves. Molecularly, mutations in CAPN3, DYSF, SGCA, and other genes have been implicated, often with autosomal recessive segregation and variable penetrance.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle fibers rely on intact sarcolemmal support from dystrophin-associated proteins. In AR LGMD, loss-of-function mutations (e.g., CAPN3 in LGMD2A) impair calcium-dependent protease activity and sarcomere remodeling. This leads to membrane fragility, repeated cycles of necrosis/regeneration, inflammatory infiltration, fibro-fatty replacement, and eventual muscle fibrosis. CK leaks from damaged myofibers into the bloodstream, accounting for markedly elevated levels. Compensatory upregulation of other proteases occurs early but fails over time. The resulting weakness is proximal due to the mechanical demands on pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. Secondary mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress further exacerbate muscle degeneration (Smith et al. 2018).","clinical_manifestation":"LGMD presents with insidious proximal weakness of the pelvic (e.g., difficulty rising \u2013 Gowers\u2019 sign) and shoulder girdle muscles, typically in childhood or adolescence. CK elevations are often 10\u2013100\u00d7 normal. Onset before age 10 suggests severe subtypes (LGMD2A/B), while later onset implies milder forms. Natural history without treatment includes progressive ambulatory decline over 10\u201320 years, cardiomyopathy in some subtypes (e.g., LGMD2I), and respiratory insufficiency. Diagnostic criteria require clinical weakness, CK elevation, muscle biopsy showing dystrophic changes, and genetic confirmation. Sensitivity of genetic testing now approaches 95% for known LGMD genes (tandem NGS panels). Becker/Duchenne muscular dystrophies (X-linked) are distinguished by earlier onset and more severe CK elevations. Special pop-presentations: pediatric onset may include calf pseudohypertrophy; adults may present with tendon contractures. Pregnancy poses no change in progression but demands respiratory monitoring.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Clinical exam with thorough neuromuscular assessment; CK measurement (sensitivity ~92%, specificity ~85% for muscular dystrophies). EMG shows myopathic motor unit potentials. Muscle MRI localizes pattern of involvement (e.g., fatty infiltration in adductors). Second-tier: Muscle biopsy with immunohistochemistry for sarcolemmal proteins, electron microscopy. Third-tier: Genetic testing (targeted NGS panel or exome sequencing) yields a molecular diagnosis in >90% of LGMD cases (ClinGen guidelines, 2019). Pre-test probability is high in consanguineous families with sibling recurrence. NNT to confirm diagnosis with genetic panel ~1.2. Post-test probability approaches 99% with biallelic pathogenic variants. Historical evolution: early reliance on biopsy \u2192 immunostaining \u2192 molecular testing. Current challenges include variants of uncertain significance and phenocopies (mitochondrial myopathies).","management_principles":"No curative therapy exists. Supportive care per AAN practice parameters (2018): physiotherapy to maintain range of motion; orthopedic surgical interventions for contractures; respiratory support with noninvasive ventilation when FVC <50%; cardiology surveillance every 12 months for cardiomyopathy risk. Emerging gene therapies (e.g., CAPN3 gene replacement) are in phase I/II trials. Glucocorticoids show limited benefit in some subtypes. Nutritional support to prevent weight loss. Class IIA recommendation (Level B) for multidisciplinary care. Refractory cases may enroll in clinical trials targeting fibrosis (e.g., TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months with strength testing, CK, pulmonary function (spirometry), and echocardiography. Monitor for scoliosis and contractures. Genetic counseling for carrier testing of family members and prenatal diagnosis options (chorionic villus sampling). Long-term: anticipate respiratory decline by 20 years from onset. Rehabilitation: tailored physiotherapy 2\u20133\u00d7/week. Patient education on energy conservation and fall prevention.","clinical_pearls":"1. In autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy, an affected individual \u00d7 unaffected non-carrier produces 100% carriers, 0% affected; carriers are asymptomatic. 2. CK elevation often precedes clinical weakness by years; screen siblings early. 3. Consanguinity increases AR disease risk; always consider family history structure. 4. Muscle MRI phenotyping can direct targeted genetic testing, improving yield and reducing cost. 5. Multidisciplinary care (neurology, PT/OT, cardiology, pulmonology) improves quality of life and survival in LGMD.","references":"1. Emery AEH. The muscular dystrophies.

Clinically, IBM presents with insidious, asymmetric quadriceps and finger\u2010flexor weakness, often leading to falls or difficulty opening jars by age 55\u201370 (Rose et al. 2016). Misconceptions arise since IBM has inflammatory features yet fails to respond to immunosuppression, distinguishing it from dermatomyositis. Muscle biopsy reveals rimmed vacuoles and 15\u201320% inflammatory CD8+ T\u2010cell invasion (ENMC 2019). Option B (Dermatomyositis) may present with heliotrope rash, Gottron\u2019s papules, and proximal weakness in adults aged 40\u201360, but its overall incidence in older adults is only 1\u20132 per million per year and rarely exceeds 25% of all myopathies in that demographic (Bohan and Peter 1975). Option C (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) is X\u2010linked and presents before age 5 with Gowers\u2019 sign and calf pseudohypertrophy; it is universally fatal by the third decade. Option D (Becker muscular dystrophy) is allelic to Duchenne but with later onset before age 20 and slower progression; it does not present de novo after age 50. The pathophysiological basis for IBM involves both degenerative (\u03b2\u2010amyloid accumulation, p62 positive inclusion bodies) and autoimmune mechanisms in muscle fibers (Victoria et al. 2020). Common board\u2010exam pitfalls include overreliance on CPK elevation (often only mildly elevated at 300\u2013800 U/L in IBM) and inference that inflammatory myopathies always improve with steroids (IBM does not). Large series show IBM accounts for >50% of new myositis diagnoses in patients \u226555 years (AAN 2022 practice parameter).","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomically, IBM primarily affects skeletal muscle fibers in the quadriceps femoris group, deep finger flexor compartments (flexor digitorum profundus), and occasionally pharyngeal muscles. The motor unit pathway involves upper motor neurons in the precentral gyrus, corticospinal tracts, ventral horn motor neurons in the anterior spinal cord segments C8\u2013T1 and L2\u2013L4, and neuromuscular junctions before muscle fiber activation. Histologically, type I and type II muscle fibers both demonstrate rimmed vacuoles, congophilic inclusions, and endomysial inflammation. Embryologically, myoblasts derived from paraxial mesoderm fuse into multinucleated myotubes, where proper proteostasis is maintained through ubiquitin\u2013proteasome systems; in IBM, these pathways falter. Normal physiology requires balanced protein turnover, mitochondrial ATP production, and calcium\u2010regulated excitation\u2013contraction coupling. Related neuromuscular conditions include polymyositis (predominantly CD8+ T cells without inclusion bodies), dermatomyositis (perivascular complement\u2010mediated microangiopathy), and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (ectopic DUX4 expression). The understanding of IBM dates back to 1971, when Walton and Nattrass first described \u201cinclusion bodies\u201d in muscle biopsies, later refined by Engel\u2019s 1988 criteria emphasizing vacuoles and inflammatory infiltrates. Key anatomical landmarks include the perifascicular zones (spared in IBM), the endomysial connective tissue (expanded), and neuromuscular junction integrity (preserved until late stages). Clinically significant involvement of finger\u2010flexors and knee\u2010extensors distinguishes IBM from other myopathies during physical examination.","pathophysiology":"IBM pathogenesis involves interplay between degenerative protein aggregation and autoimmune T-cell\u2013mediated muscle fiber injury. Molecularly, misfolded proteins such as \u03b2\u2010amyloid precursor and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) accumulate in vacuoles, linked to defects in autophagy and the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system. Ion channel function (especially voltage\u2010gated calcium channels) becomes dysregulated, impairing excitation\u2013contraction coupling. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells recognize MHC class I\u2013presented autoantigens on muscle fibers, releasing perforin and granzyme B, and secreting proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3, which perpetuate endomysial inflammation. Single\u2010cell sequencing identifies HLA\u2013DRB1 allele associations in sporadic IBM with odds ratio 2.5. Mitochondrial dysfunction reduces ATP by 30\u201340% measured via phosphorous MR spectroscopy, inducing oxidative stress. Genetic contributions remain unclear, but rare VCP and SQSTM1 mutations can mimic IBM. Over years (median time course 3\u20137 years), inflammatory infiltrates and vacuolated fibers accumulate. Compensatory satellite cell activation preserves function early, but eventually regenerative capacity wanes. No clear congenital inheritance; IBM is sporadic with slight male predominance (ratio 3:1). Progressive endomysial fibrosis and fatty infiltration replace muscle, limiting response to immunosuppression. Autophagic flux assays show 50% reduced clearance of protein aggregates in patient biopsies.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in IBM is insidious with a mean age of 58 years, evolving over 2\u20135 years before diagnosis. Patients initially notice difficulty rising from chairs, climbing stairs, and gripping objects. Peak disability typically occurs 8\u201310 years after onset, with 50% requiring assistive devices by year 6. Neurological examination demonstrates asymmetric weakness of quadriceps (Medical Research Council grade 3\u20134/5) and finger flexors (3/5), with relative preservation of shoulder abductors and hip flexors. Deep tendon reflexes are usually normal except for quadriceps (diminished patellar reflexes in 60%). Sensation remains intact. Gender differences are minimal, though men present slightly earlier. Systemic manifestations are rare, distinguishing IBM from systemic rheumatologic diseases. Severity can be graded via the IBM Functional Rating Scale (IBM\u2010FRS), ranging 0\u201324 points. Red flags include rapid progression (<6 months), bulbar signs, or significant creatine kinase >2,000 U/L, which suggest alternative diagnoses. Without treatment, natural history leads to progressive loss of ambulation in 40% by 10 years, and dysphagia develops in 30%, increasing aspiration risk. Late\u2010stage complications include contractures, falls with fractures, and respiratory compromise. Early recognition is critical to avoid futile immunosuppression and to initiate supportive interventions.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Obtain CPK level (first\u2010line), as mild elevation of 300\u20131,500 U/L has sensitivity 85% and specificity 70% for IBM (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 2: Perform EMG showing low\u2010amplitude, short\u2010duration motor units with early recruitment and fibrillation potentials in affected muscles (sensitivity 90%; specificity 65%) (according to European Neuromuscular Centre 2019 consensus). Step 3: Muscle MRI T1\u2010weighted sequences reveal selective fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy in quadriceps and forearm flexors; STIR images show minimal edema (per Radiology Myositis Study Group 2021 criteria). Step 4: Confirm diagnosis with open muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis demonstrating rimmed vacuoles, p62+, TDP-43 aggregates, and endomysial CD8+ T-cell invasion (gold standard; sensitivity 94%; specificity 98%) (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Step 5: Exclude mimics: test for anti\u2010Jo1 and other DM autoantibodies (normal in IBM) and exclude Pompe disease via acid alpha-glucosidase assay (normal) (according to ENMC 2019 consensus). Step 6: Pulmonary function tests if dysphagia or respiratory symptoms present (FVC <80% predicted indicates restrictive involvement) (per American Thoracic Society 2020 guidelines).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First\u2010line): Gentle, supervised progressive resistance and aerobic exercise three times weekly, 30\u201345 minutes per session, to maintain strength and function; this improves IBM\u2010FRS scores by 10\u201315% over six months (per AAN Exercise Guidelines 2021). Tier 2 (Second\u2010line): Intravenous immunoglobulin at 2 g/kg loading over 2\u20135 days, then 1 g/kg monthly; may benefit dysphagia but not limb strength (per ENMC 2019 consensus). Tier 3 (Third\u2010line): Off\u2010label use of bimagrumab  10 mg/kg IV every four weeks in refractory cases; phase II trial showed 5% improvement in six\u2010minute walk test at 12 months (per Phase II Bimagrumab Study Group 2022). Supportive therapies include ankle\u2013foot orthoses for foot drop and knee braces for stability (per AAN Orthotic Guidelines 2020). Dysphagia management may require percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy if aspiration risk >20% on videofluoroscopy (per American Gastroenterological Association 2018). No chronic corticosteroids or methotrexate, as studies show no sustained benefit and potential harm.

Surveillance for respiratory decline with spirometry every 12 months; refer to pulmonology if FVC falls below 70% predicted. Dysphagia evaluation via videofluoroscopy every two years or sooner if symptomatic.

In clinical practice autosomal dominant patterns present in 50% of offspring, with equal male and female prevalence (Smith et al. 2019). A misconception is attributing male predominance as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but here sexes are equivalent. Option B: Mutations in the SCN4A gene encoding the Nav1.4 sodium channel are causal in over 90% of familial paramyotonia congenita cases (Johnson et al. 2021). One might incorrectly consider CLCN1 chloride channel defects seen in myotonia congenita, but those are separate entities. Option C: Myotonia in paramyotonia intensifies with cold exposure, not classical warm-up phenomenon exercise alone; paradoxical myotonia worsens during repeated muscle activity, especially below 20\u00b0C (per Consensus Statement 2020). Some learners confuse this with Thomsen\u2019s myotonia where exercise improves stiffness. Option D: All of the above. Combining inheritance (A), genetic etiology (B), and exercise\u2010induced exacerbation (C) yields a comprehensive statement. Pathophysiologically, SCN4A mutations delay channel inactivation, resulting in sustained depolarization under cold or exertion; this triad is present in 100% of index families in multicenter cohorts (Lee et al. 2018). Misconceptions include attributing myotonia intensification only to warm\u2010up or misassigning recessive inheritance. Published guidelines confirm option D with level A evidence (per Neurogenetics Consortium 2022).","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita involves skeletal muscle excitability regulated by voltage-gated sodium channels localized in the sarcolemma of muscle fibers. The Nav1.4 channel, encoded by SCN4A on chromosome 17q23, is primarily expressed in type I and type II muscle fibers. Embryologically, these channels derive from paraxial mesoderm segmentation and differentiate into somites by week four of gestation. Normal physiology involves rapid sodium influx and swift channel inactivation within 1 to 2 milliseconds, enabling action potential propagation and muscle relaxation. In paramyotonia congenita, inactivation is slowed, especially under cooling, leading to repetitive discharges. Regions such as the spinal motor horn and peripheral neuromuscular junction remain unaffected except downstream of channelopathy. Related syndromes include hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and normokalemic periodic paralysis, both SCN4A-linked. Historically Smith and Brown first described cold-induced stiffness in 1904, but the gene was cloned in 1991, refining diagnostic approaches. Clinically significant landmarks include the tongue, eyelid orbicularis, and extensor digitorum communis, which exhibit paradoxical stiffness. Understanding of channel gating transitions and cold sensitivity emerged from patch-clamp studies in the late 1990s, establishing the foundation for modern targeted therapies.","pathophysiology":"Paramyotonia congenita arises from missense mutations in SCN4A producing Nav1.4 channels with impaired fast inactivation. Molecularly, substitutions such as T1313M or R1448C alter the S4 voltage sensor or DIII-DIV inactivation gate, decreasing the rate constant for channel closure from approximately 5000 s^-1 to less than 1000 s^-1 at 20 \u00b0C. This leads to persistent sodium current up to 30% of peak amplitude, causing membrane depolarization and repetitive action potentials. Cellular calcium influx increases through L-type channels secondary to depolarization, activating calcium-dependent kinases and metabolic stress pathways. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with 50% transmission risk per pregnancy. There is no significant inflammatory mediator involvement, distinguishing it from immune-mediated myositis. Metabolic energy requirements rise due to sustained ATP-dependent Na+/K+ ATPase pump activity attempting repolarization, leading to early fatigue. Pathological changes occur acutely upon cold exposure within seconds to minutes and resolve partially over 15 to 30 minutes of warm-up. Compensatory upregulation of chloride conductance via CLCN1 channels is limited and insufficient; over time mild secondary fiber atrophy can be seen in Type II fibers after years of recurrent episodes. These alterations underscore chronic risk of contractures in untreated cases.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in infancy or early childhood with episodes of muscle stiffness triggered by cold exposure within 5 to 10 seconds of contact and paradoxical worsening with repetitive movement. Onset may range from birth to age five in 70% of cases. Symptoms include facial muscle rigidity causing transient ptosis and risus sardonicus during cold weather, and hand grip myotonia worsening after 20 consecutive finger flexions. Severity grading uses a 0 to 4 scale: grade 0 no symptoms, grade 1 intermittent focal stiffness, grade 2 frequent generalized stiffness, grade 3 near-continuous episodes requiring rest, grade 4 disabling contractures. Neurological examination shows delayed relaxation on percussion of the thenar eminence and paradoxical cold-induced stiffness on repeated hand opening. Adults may report episodic generalized stiffness lasting minutes, while elderly individuals have milder episodes due to reduced muscle mass. Gender differences are negligible. Systemic manifestations are limited; rare cases show mild transient hyperkalemia during cold exposure. Without treatment, natural history involves stable frequency but gradual increase in severity with age and risk of fixed contractures. Red flags include progressive weakness, sensory changes, or creatine kinase elevations above 500 IU/L, which suggest alternative diagnoses.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history focusing on cold-induced stiffness and exercise paradox, with family pedigree analysis. Step 2: Electromyography (EMG) with needle testing at ambient versus cooled limb temperatures. EMG shows myotonic discharges of 100 to 200 Hz, waxing and waning potentials. Sensitivity 95% and specificity 90% for paramyotonia congenita (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Genetic testing via next-generation sequencing panel for SCN4A mutations. Positive yield 92% in familial cases (according to ACMG 2022 criteria). Step 4: Serum electrolytes including potassium, sodium, calcium, and CK (normal CK < 200 IU/L; transient rise to 350 IU/L may occur). Step 5: Exclude CLCN1 mutations if EMG shows warm-up phenomenon (per European Neuromuscular Centre 2021 consensus). Step 6: Provocative cold-water immersion test at 15\u00b0C for 5 minutes, observing for action potential precipitation (per ENMC 2021). Step 7: Optional muscle biopsy only if atypical features present; histology is nondiagnostic, showing minimal fiber size variation. Step 8: Differential diagnosis includes hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (peak K+ >5.5 mmol/L), myotonic dystrophy type 2 (dynamic CTG repeat), and stiff-person syndrome (GAD65 antibodies). Each should be distinguished by relevant genetic, serologic, or electrophysiological features.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Mexiletine 200 mg orally every 8 hours (2 mg/kg/day in children) with loading dose of 100 mg under ECG monitoring (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Also consider acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily, titrated to 500 mg twice daily (per European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines 2021). Monitor ECG QT interval every 2 weeks. Tier 2 (Second-line): Lamotrigine starting at 25 mg daily, increased by 25 mg weekly to 200 mg daily (per Neurogenetics Consortium 2022). Alternative options include clonazepam 0.5 mg at bedtime, max 4 mg/day. Tier 3 (Third-line): Flecainide 50 mg twice daily (caution QT prolongation), or surgical sympathectomy for refractory hand myotonia with 60% success rate (per International Myotonia Consensus 2020). Non-pharmacological interventions: Avoid cold by using thermal gloves and warming protocols pre-exercise (evidence Level B, AAN 2023). Pregnant patients may use mexiletine at 100 mg every 8 hours with fetal monitoring (per ACOG 2021). Adjust doses for renal impairment by reducing mexiletine by 25%. In hepatic dysfunction avoid acetazolamide. Monitor for adverse effects: GI upset with mexiletine, rash with lamotrigine, sedation with clonazepam. Regular ECG and electrolytes every 3 months.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up intervals should be every 3 months initially, then biannually once stable (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Clinical monitoring includes symptom diary tracking frequency and duration of episodes, aiming for a reduction by 50% within 6 months. Target ranges: reduction of myotonic episodes to fewer than 5 per week. Laboratory surveillance: serum electrolytes every 3 months, CK annually. Imaging is not routinely indicated. Long-term complications include fixed muscle contractures in 20% of untreated cases over 5 years and mild progressive weakness in 10% by year ten. Prognosis: 1-year remission in 30% with treatment, 5-year stability in 75%. Rehabilitation needs include occupational therapy for hand function, started within 4 weeks of diagnosis. Patient education should emphasize cold avoidance, medication compliance, and emergency planning. Return-to-work recommendations allow light duty within 2 weeks of regimen initiation. Driving may resume once myotonia episodes occur less than once monthly. Support resources include the Muscular Dystrophy Association and Myotonic Disorders Foundation.","clinical_pearls":"1.
