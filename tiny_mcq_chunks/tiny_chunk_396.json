[{"question_number":"5","question":"A female patient on four AEDs still has abnormal movements for more than one hour, with a normal prolonged electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain. What is the next step?","options":["Stop all AEDs (consider PNES)","Repeat prolonged EEG"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Stop all AEDs (consider PNES)","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Stopping anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and considering psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) is the recommended next step after a normal prolonged video-EEG and normal MRI in a patient continuing to have paroxysmal motor events. Evidence shows that in events without electrographic correlates on prolonged video-EEG monitoring, the likelihood of PNES is very high (sensitivity > 95%, specificity > 90%). Continuing AEDs in PNES provides no benefit and exposes the patient to side effects. Option B (repeat prolonged EEG) is redundant because an adequately performed video-EEG has already excluded epileptiform activity. Repeating the same test is unlikely to alter management and delays correct diagnosis and psychosocial intervention.","conceptual_foundation":"Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are functional neurological symptom disorder events that mimic epileptic seizures but lack ictal EEG changes. In ICD-11, they are classified under Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder (6B41), and DSM-5-TR places them under Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) with seizures or convulsions. PNES must be differentiated from epileptic seizures by demonstrating typical event semiology in the absence of EEG changes. Video-EEG monitoring is the gold standard. Over time, the diagnostic criteria and classification have evolved from hysteria-based concepts in 19th-century neurology to modern biopsychosocial frameworks. Embryologically there is no structural lesion; the etiology is rooted in emotional stressors and maladaptive coping. Motor manifestations involve cortical-subcortical networks but without hypersynchronous discharges. The absence of EEG correlates during an event is pathognomonic.","pathophysiology":"Normal seizure physiology involves hypersynchronous neuronal discharges in cortical networks, leading to ictal EEG changes. In PNES, abnormal movements arise from abnormal functional activation patterns in motor planning and emotional regulation circuits (e.g. supplementary motor area, limbic structures), without paroxysmal epileptiform activity. Neuroimaging (fMRI) studies show altered connectivity between prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and amygdala in PNES patients. Neurotransmitter dysregulation (GABAergic and glutamatergic balance) is intact in PNES, contrasting with the excitation\u2013inhibition imbalance in epilepsy. Psychosocial stressors trigger functional motor outputs via aberrant top-down motor control. There is no progressive tissue injury or neuronal loss.","clinical_manifestation":"PNES typically present as prolonged, variable motor events lasting minutes to hours, often with asynchronous limb movements, side-to-side head shaking, pelvic thrusting, and closed eyes with resistance to opening. Patients may have preserved awareness or shaky tremulous movements compared to stereotyped tonic\u2013clonic seizures. Up to 80% of PNES occur in women, often in young adulthood, and are associated with psychiatric comorbidities (depression, PTSD). Prodromal emotional distress is common. Events may cluster daily or weekly. Between events, neurological examination is normal. Migraine, syncope, and movement disorders are differential diagnoses.","diagnostic_approach":"The gold standard diagnostic test is inpatient video-EEG monitoring capturing a typical event with synchronous video and multichannel EEG. A negative EEG during the event rules out epileptic seizures. First-tier evaluation includes detailed history, interictal EEG (sensitivity ~50%), and MRI to exclude structural pathology. In this case, both video-EEG and MRI are normal. Second-tier includes psychological assessment for comorbidities. Repeating prolonged EEG without video adds no value. Pretest probability of PNES after a normal video-EEG event approaches 99%.","management_principles":"Management centers on explanation of diagnosis, withdrawal of AEDs, and referral to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Randomized trials of CBT in PNES show a 50%\u201370% reduction in event frequency compared to supportive therapy. No AED has demonstrated efficacy in PNES. Engagement of psychiatry and neurology in a multidisciplinary model is recommended by the International League Against Epilepsy PNES Task Force. Education reduces stigma. Treatment of comorbid depression or anxiety follows standard psychopharmacology.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes regular neurology visits to monitor AED withdrawal, psychiatric follow-up for psychotherapy, and assessment of functional status. Initially, visits every 4\u20136 weeks during tapering, then every 3\u20136 months once stable. Use Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales quarterly. Avoid repeat EEG unless new events with different semiology arise. Monitor quality of life with QOLIE-31 at 6-month intervals.","clinical_pearls":"1. A normal prolonged video-EEG capturing typical events virtually excludes epileptic seizures (sensitivity >95%). mnemonic: \u201cEEG negative = PNES objective.\u201d 2. PNES events often last longer (>2 minutes) than epileptic seizures (<2 minutes). 3. Asynchronous, side-to-side movements and pelvic thrusting favor PNES over epilepsy. 4. Abrupt withdrawal of AEDs should be gradual under supervision to avoid iatrogenic withdrawal seizures. 5. Multidisciplinary care including CBT is more effective than AED polytherapy in PNES.","references":"1. Reuber M, Elger CE. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: review and update.

Multiple large cohort studies and meta-analyses demonstrate that the cumulative risk of seizure recurrence at two years ranges between 35% and 50%, with landmark data reporting approximately 45% recurrence. For example, Berg et al. (Epilepsia 2000;41(4):465\u2013472) found a two-year recurrence risk of 45% (95% CI, 40\u201350%) among adults with a first unprovoked seizure. Hesdorffer et al. (Neurology 1998;51(2):209\u2013215) reported a 37.9% recurrence within two years. The American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter (Krumholz et al., Neurology 2007;69(21):1996\u20132007) states: \"In adults with a first unprovoked seizure, the chance of recurrence within 2 years is about 45%.\" Thus, option A is factually inaccurate. Common misconceptions include quoting a 30% figure derived from subgroups without risk factors or from shorter follow-up durations. There is no evidence supporting an overall 30% two-year recurrence rate in unselected patients, rendering option A incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding the recurrence risk after a first seizure requires familiarity with seizure classification, epidemiology, and underlying nosology. A first unprovoked seizure is defined by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) as a seizure occurring in the absence of acute provocation (Fisher et al., Epilepsia 2014;55(4):475\u2013482). In ICD-11, this falls under 8A60.0 (single epileptic seizure). The DSM-5-TR recognizes epileptic disorders under 6A80, distinguishing between provoked and unprovoked seizures. Historically, classifications evolved from the 1981 ILAE terminology, which focused on idiopathic versus symptomatic categories, to the 2017 ILAE operational seizure types and epilepsy syndromes classification (Fisher et al., Epilepsia 2017;58(4):531\u2013542). Differential considerations for a first seizure include acute symptomatic causes (e.g., metabolic derangements, CNS infection), febrile seizures in children, and psychogenic non-epileptic events. Epidemiological studies reveal an incidence of first unprovoked seizure at 50\u201370 per 100,000 per year in adults, with recurrence risks influenced by age, etiology, and interictal EEG findings. Recognizing these foundational concepts is essential for interpreting recurrence data and guiding management decisions.","pathophysiology":"The normal physiology of neuronal networks involves a delicate balance between excitatory glutamatergic transmission and inhibitory GABAergic tone. A first unprovoked seizure typically reflects a transient destabilization of this balance due to structural lesions, channelopathies, or network hypersynchrony. Molecularly, alterations in voltage\u2010gated sodium and calcium channels (e.g., SCN1A mutations), dysfunction of GABA-A receptors, and neuroinflammatory cascades can lower seizure threshold. After an initial seizure, pathophysiological mechanisms such as activity-dependent synaptic modification (\u201ckindling\u201d), maladaptive neurogenesis, and gliosis can lead to enduring network hyperexcitability. Kindling, characterized by progressive intensification of response to repeated subthreshold stimuli, has been demonstrated in animal models (McNamara JO, Epilepsia 1994;35 Suppl 6:S78\u2013S83). Persistent changes in ion channel expression and synaptic connectivity potentiate recurrent seizure propensity. These processes evolve over weeks to months, explaining the temporal risk of recurrence. Unlike acute symptomatic seizures, unprovoked seizures reflect intrinsic network pathology with long-term remodeling, accounting for recurrence rates significantly above baseline population risk.","clinical_manifestation":"A first unprovoked seizure can present with focal or generalized features. Focal seizures commonly manifest with motor automatisms, sensory auras, or autonomic changes, whereas generalized seizures frequently produce abrupt loss of consciousness and bilateral motor activity. Prodromal symptoms such as mood changes or cognitive disturbances are reported in 10\u201320% of cases. Postictal confusion, headache, and focal neurological deficits occur in 30\u201350%. Recurrent seizures within two years often mirror the initial semiology, although secondary generalization may develop. Subtypes include focal aware seizures, focal impaired-awareness seizures, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, each with distinctive clinical signs. Epidemiologically, men and women exhibit similar risks, but pediatric and elderly populations have variable etiologies (e.g., developmental malformations in children, cerebrovascular disease in the elderly). Without antiseizure drug (ASD) intervention, natural history data show that approximately 40\u201350% of adults will have a second seizure within two years, with half experiencing recurrence in the first year. This underscores the significance of accurate recurrence risk estimation for early management decisions.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation of a first unprovoked seizure follows a tiered approach. First-tier investigations include urgent basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, toxicology screen, and non-contrast CT head to exclude acute structural lesions (AAN Level B evidence; American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter, Krumholz et al. 2007). Interictal EEG within 24\u201348 hours sensitively detects epileptiform discharges (sensitivity 60%, specificity 75%), raising recurrence probability by 1.5\u20132\u00d7. Second-tier studies include high-resolution MRI with epilepsy protocol to identify mesial temporal sclerosis or cortical dysplasia (sensitivity 88%, specificity 92%). Pre-test probability stratification uses clinical risk factors: abnormal EEG (HR 2.4), remote symptomatic etiology (HR 3.0), and sharp waves on EEG (HR 1.8). Third-tier assessments involve prolonged video-EEG monitoring for event characterization and functional imaging (e.g., ictal SPECT) in complex cases. Pre- and post-test probability calculations guide ASD initiation. Number needed to test (NNT) for EEG to change management is 5, and MRI identifies etiological lesions in 20\u201330%. Resource-limited settings may prioritize EEG and CT over MRI with follow-up imaging as indicated.","management_principles":"Initiation of ASD after a first seizure requires weighing the risk of recurrence against potential adverse effects. Guidelines recommend treatment if two-year recurrence risk exceeds 60% (IFA Guidelines 2018). Given the 45% baseline risk, treatment is considered when additional risk factors (abnormal EEG, structural lesion) raise individualized risk above threshold. First-line ASDs include levetiracetam (initial 500 mg BID, target 1000\u20131500 mg BID; Level A evidence for focal seizures) and lamotrigine (initial 25 mg daily, titrate to 200 mg daily; HR <0.5 compared to placebo). Carbamazepine (200 mg BID to 600 mg BID) is also effective in focal epilepsy (NNT 5 for seizure freedom). Adverse effect profiles, pharmacokinetics, comorbidities, and patient preference inform selection. Non-pharmacological measures such as sleep hygiene and reducing alcohol intake complement therapy. In patients with remote symptomatic causes (e.g., stroke), secondary prevention with AEDs may be prioritized. Refractory cases necessitate specialist referral for polytherapy or surgical evaluation. Pregnancy, hepatic, and renal impairment require dose adjustment and agent selection (e.g., avoid valproate in women of childbearing potential).","follow_up_guidelines":"After initiating treatment, outpatient follow-up occurs at 1 month, then quarterly for the first year to assess efficacy, adherence, and adverse effects. Laboratory monitoring includes CBC and liver function tests at baseline and every 6 months for enzyme-inducing AEDs. Routine EEG is repeated at 6\u201312 months to evaluate subclinical epileptiform activity; imaging follow-up is guided by clinical changes. Functional assessments, including quality-of-life scales (QOLIE-31), are administered annually. Duration of therapy after a single recurrence is typically two years seizure-free, per ILAE recommendations, before considering tapering. Relapse risk upon withdrawal is 30\u201350%; risk stratification uses initial etiology and EEG findings. Transition of care to primary providers focuses on medication management, safety counseling (driving restrictions: 6 months seizure-free), and lifestyle modifications. Rehabilitation services address cognitive and psychosocial sequelae. Patient education emphasizes trigger avoidance and seizure first-aid for caregivers.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Regulatory approval ensures the drug is legally available and its safety and efficacy have been evaluated by local authorities (Level A evidence per ILAE guidelines). Teratogenic potential is critical, as certain AEDs (e.g., valproate) carry high risk of neural-tube defects; safer alternatives (e.g., lamotrigine, levetiracetam) are preferred in reproductive-age women (AAN 2017). Drug\u2013drug interactions are especially important when combining multiple AEDs, as enzyme inducers or inhibitors can alter plasma levels and precipitate breakthrough seizures or toxicity (Level B evidence; French et al., 2014). Hepatic enzyme elevation is a known adverse effect of many AEDs (e.g., carbamazepine, valproate) and mandates liver\u2010function monitoring; selection of an AED with minimal hepatotoxicity (e.g., levetiracetam) may reduce risk (Level B). No single consideration supersedes the others; together, they guide a patient-centered approach.","conceptual_foundation":"New AED selection requires integration of regulatory status, reproductive safety, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles. In epilepsy management, drugs are classified by mechanism (sodium-channel blockers, GABA enhancers, SV2A ligands) and by safety in pregnancy (pregnancy category). Genetic polymorphisms in drug\u2010metabolizing enzymes (CYP450 isoforms, UGT1A4) influence individual response and risk of drug interactions. The Saudi FDA approval process parallels FDA and EMA pathways, evaluating clinical trial data in seizure control and adverse events. AED\u2010induced hepatic injury involves direct hepatotoxicity and immune\u2010mediated mechanisms, correlating with specific HLA alleles.","pathophysiology":"AEDs modulate neuronal excitability via sodium\u2010channel blockade, calcium\u2010channel modulation, GABAergic potentiation, or synaptic vesicle 2A (SV2A) binding. Enzyme\u2010inducing AEDs (e.g., phenobarbital, carbamazepine) increase CYP450 activity, reducing levels of co-administered drugs and potentially lowering seizure threshold. Hepatotoxicity arises from reactive intermediate formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune hapten formation. Teratogenicity mechanisms include folate antagonism and oxidative stress in the developing embryo. Drug interactions can occur at absorption, distribution, metabolism (CYP, UGT), or elimination (renal tubular transporters).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients on multiple AEDs often report breakthrough seizures, cognitive slowing, or fatigue. Hepatic enzyme elevations are typically asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities but can progress to cholestatic injury. Teratogenic outcomes include neural-tube defects (5\u201310% risk with valproate vs. 1\u20132% baseline). Drug interactions manifest as subtherapeutic levels (leading to seizures) or supra-therapeutic levels (leading to ataxia, dizziness). Clinical monitoring involves seizure diaries, liver\u2010function tests every 6\u201312 weeks, and preconception counseling.","diagnostic_approach":"Baseline labs: CBC, LFTs, renal function. Therapeutic drug monitoring: trough serum levels at steady state. Preconception folate levels and counseling. Drug\u2013drug interaction checklists via prescribing software.

The hallmark aura in MTLE is an epigastric rising sensation often described as a visceral or autonomic phenomenon, sometimes accompanied by autonomic signs such as pallor or flushing. Cephalic auras\u2014sensations of head pressure or movement\u2014are more typical of frontal lobe epilepsy and are supported by EEG correlation studies showing frontal-onset discharges (Lee et al., 2014). No primary literature or epilepsy society guideline lists cephalic aura as a specific MTLE aura (Fisher et al., 2017). Therefore, the only option given is incorrect. A more accurate correct answer would be \u201cEpigastric rising sensation.\u201d","conceptual_foundation":"An aura represents a simple partial (focal aware) seizure arising from a localized epileptogenic zone. In MTLE, the epileptogenic focus resides in the hippocampus and adjacent mesial structures including the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. The visceral/autonomic auras arise due to involvement of the insular cortex and anterior cingulate pathways via hippocampal\u2013fornical circuits. Nosologically, MTLE is classified under focal epilepsies of structural etiology in the ILAE 2017 classification. Differential diagnoses include frontal lobe epilepsy, parietal lobe epilepsy, and psychogenic nonepileptic events. Embryologically, the hippocampus derives from the medial pallium, which matures by 20 gestational weeks; sclerosis or dysplasia here predisposes to MTLE. Neuroanatomically, the hippocampus receives afferents from the entorhinal cortex and projects via the fornix to the mammillary bodies, modulating autonomic outflow via the hypothalamus. Glutamatergic hyperexcitability in CA3\u2013CA1 circuits underlies seizure generation, exacerbated by mossy fiber sprouting in sclerotic hippocampi.","pathophysiology":"Normal hippocampal physiology involves finely tuned glutamate\u2013GABA balance. In MTLE, hippocampal sclerosis\u2014characterized by neuronal loss in CA1 and hilus and gliosis\u2014leads to mossy fiber sprouting and recurrent excitatory circuits. Upregulation of NMDA receptor subunits (NR2B) and downregulation of GABAA receptor function have been demonstrated in resected tissue (Babb et al., 2016), promoting synchronous discharges. This hyperexcitability propagates through limbic connections to autonomic centers in the insula, producing visceral sensations, and to the orbitofrontal cortex, producing affective phenomena such as fear or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Over time, compensatory GABAergic sprouting may occur but is insufficient to prevent seizure recurrence. Acute seizures trigger inflammatory cascades (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) that further lower seizure threshold. Chronic changes include aberrant neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and progressive atrophy.","clinical_manifestation":"MTLE typically presents in adolescence or early adulthood. The cardinal aura is a rising epigastric sensation (60\u201380% of patients), often accompanied by autonomic signs\u2014sweating, pallor, flushing in 30\u201350%. Psychic phenomena such as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (20\u201340%) or jamais vu, fear, or olfactory hallucinations (10\u201320%) may occur. Consciousness is usually impaired within seconds, with subsequent automatisms (oroalimentary, manual). Seizures last 60\u2013120 seconds. Temporal lobe seizures can generalize. Variants include purely autonomic auras without secondarily generalized seizures and focal aware seizures in early disease. Untreated, patients average 50\u2013200 seizures per month. ILAE diagnostic criteria require two unprovoked seizures 24 hours apart and supportive EEG or MRI evidence of hippocampal sclerosis (sensitivity 80%, specificity 90%).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes a detailed seizure history and high-resolution 3 T MRI with epilepsy protocol (AAN Level B evidence), which detects hippocampal sclerosis with sensitivity 85% and specificity 95%. Interictal scalp EEG reveals unilateral anterior temporal spikes in 60\u201390%. If MRI is negative, FDG-PET demonstrates temporal hypometabolism (sensitivity 80%, specificity 75%). Video EEG monitoring with ictal recordings (gold standard) localizes onset with >90% accuracy. Neuropsychological testing assesses Wada memory lateralization. In refractory cases, intracranial EEG (depth electrodes) is indicated. Pretest probability of MTLE in focal seizures with epigastric aura is \u22480.7; a positive MRI raises posttest probability to >0.95.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for MTLE is monotherapy with carbamazepine or lamotrigine (AAN Class I trials show \u226550% seizure reduction in 60\u201370%). Carbamazepine initiation at 200 mg/day, titrate by 200 mg every 1\u20132 weeks to 800\u20131200 mg/day; monitor levels (target 4\u201312 \u00b5g/mL) and CBC/LFTs. Lamotrigine titrate slowly to 300\u2013400 mg/day to reduce rash risk; monitoring not required. Second-tier includes levetiracetam (500\u20132000 mg BID) or oxcarbazepine. In drug-resistant MTLE (failure of \u22652 AEDs), surgical evaluation for anterior temporal lobectomy is indicated (Class I evidence: 60\u201380% seizure freedom at 1 year; NNT\u22482). Vagus nerve stimulation and responsive neurostimulation are options. Nonpharmacological: ketogenic diet in children; CBT for comorbid psychiatric symptoms.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor seizure diaries monthly and AED blood levels every 3\u20136 months until stable, then biannually. MRI every 2\u20133 years if clinical change. Neuropsychological testing at 1 year post\u2013surgery. Assess bone density in long-term AED use every 2\u20133 years. Pregnancy planning: switch from valproate to lamotrigine/carbamazepine preconception. Taper off AED after 2 seizure-free years under specialist guidance (recurrence risk 20\u201340%). Quality of life tools (QOLIE-31) annually. Refer to epilepsy nurse for rescue med training and SUDEP counseling.","clinical_pearls":"1.

According to the 2010 ILAE consensus, drug\u2010resistant epilepsy is defined as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated, appropriately chosen and used anti\u2010seizure medication schedules, whether as monotherapies or in combination (Level B evidence, Kwan et al. Epilepsia 2010). Surgical referral at this stage yields seizure freedom rates of 60\u201380% in temporal lobe epilepsy (Wiebe et al. N Engl J Med 2001; Engel et al. Lancet Neurol 2013). Option A (increase current medication dosage) risks toxicity without guaranteed efficacy once two drugs have failed. Option B (change to a different medication) may be considered, but additional trials beyond two have diminishing returns (French JA, NEJM 2008). Option D (initiate ketogenic diet) can help pediatric patients but has lower adult efficacy (~30% responders) and is typically reserved when surgery is not feasible (Kossoff et al. Epilepsy Behav 2009).","conceptual_foundation":"Refractory epilepsy (\u201cdrug\u2010resistant\u201d) occurs when two appropriate anti\u2010seizure medications fail to achieve sustained seizure freedom. In the ICD\u201011, drug\u2010resistant epilepsy is coded under 8A60.10. Differential diagnoses include psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, metabolic causes, and single\u2010drug adherence issues. The ILAE classification (2017) distinguishes focal versus generalized onset and underscores etiologic categories (structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune, unknown). Early identification of refractory cases is critical; historical delay to surgical referral averages 20 years despite guidelines recommending evaluation after two failed trials. Embryologically, many refractory focal epilepsies (e.g., cortical dysplasias) arise from aberrant neuronal migration during weeks 8\u201320. Neuroanatomically, temporal lobe foci involve hippocampal sclerosis and network changes across limbic circuits. Genetic factors (SCN1A, DEPDC5) contribute to medication resistance through ion\u2010channel dysfunction and altered GABAergic signaling.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, seizure thresholds are maintained by balanced excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neurotransmission. In refractory epilepsy, synaptic reorganization, mossy fiber sprouting, interneuron loss, and alteration of voltage\u2010gated ion channels create hyperexcitable networks. In hippocampal sclerosis, neuronal loss and gliosis disrupt inhibitory circuits, lowering seizure threshold (Morimoto et al. J Neurosci 2004). Chronic seizures induce inflammatory cascades (IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1) that further potentiate excitability (Vezzani et al. Lancet Neurol 2011). Genetic mutations in SCN1A lead to persistent sodium current and reduced inactivation, promoting persistent depolarization (Ogiwara et al. PNAS 2007). Over time, compensatory mechanisms fail, establishing a self\u2010sustaining epileptogenic focus resistant to pharmacotherapy. In contrast, metabolic etiologies (e.g., pyridoxine\u2010dependent epilepsy) may respond to targeted therapy, highlighting distinct mechanisms.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with refractory focal epilepsy often present with complex partial seizures: aura (epigastric rising), impaired awareness, automatisms, and postictal confusion. Temporal lobe epilepsy is most common, peaking in young adulthood. Generalized refractory epilepsy can present as tonic\u2013clonic seizures refractory to multiple AEDs. Seizure frequency varies from daily to weekly; interictal EEG shows focal spikes or rhythmic slowing. Natural history without surgery often includes progressive cognitive decline, psychosocial impairment, and increased SUDEP risk (~9 per 1000 patient\u2010years) (Shankar et al. Neurology 2017). In pediatric populations, refractory epilepsy syndromes (e.g., Lennox\u2010Gastaut) manifest with multiple seizure types, developmental delay, and EEG slow spike\u2010wave. Pregnancy and elderly patients require tailored management due to altered pharmacokinetics and comorbidities.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier investigations include high\u2010resolution MRI (3T) to identify structural lesions (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%), prolonged scalp EEG (72\u201096 h) capturing ictal events, and neuropsychological testing. Pretest probability for MRI abnormalities in focal drug\u2010resistant epilepsy is ~65% (Bien et al. Epilepsia 2009). Second\u2010tier: video\u2010EEG telemetry (gold standard for seizure focus localization) and PET (FDG\u2010PET identifies hypometabolism with sensitivity ~70%). Third\u2010tier: invasive monitoring (stereo\u2010EEG), magnetoencephalography, and Wada testing for language and memory lateralization. Functional MRI complements Wada with noninvasive mapping (sensitivity ~80%). Diagnostic challenges include distinguishing multifocal from diffuse epilepsies and false\u2010negative MRI in cortical dysplasia. Longitudinal studies show early comprehensive evaluation improves surgical candidacy.","management_principles":"International guidelines (ILAE 2018) recommend surgical evaluation after failure of two AEDs (Class I, Level A). First\u2010tier non\u2010pharmacologic: temporal lobectomy for unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis yields seizure freedom in ~66% at 5 years (Wiebe et al. N Engl J Med 2001). Second\u2010tier: lesionectomy, hemispherectomy in catastrophic pediatric epilepsy (Engel et al. Lancet Neurol 2013). Third\u2010tier: neuromodulation (vagal nerve stimulation, responsive neurostimulation) for non\u2010resectable foci (ORR ~50% seizure reduction at 2 years) (Jobst et al. Lancet Neurol 2017). Ketogenic diet is adjunctive in children (response ~38%) (Kossoff et al. Epilepsy Behav 2009) but less used in adults. Comprehensive presurgical evaluation includes neuropsychology, psychiatric assessment, and patient education. Key contraindications: multifocal epilepsy without clear resectable focus, progressive neurodegenerative conditions.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post\u2010surgical follow\u2010up includes outpatient visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, then annually. MRI at 6 months to assess resection cavity. EEG at 12 months for residual epileptiform activity. Neuropsychological assessments at 1 year to monitor cognitive outcomes. Monitor for surgical complications (infection, hemorrhage), neuropsychiatric changes, and AED tapering protocols (begin taper at 6\u201312 months if seizure\u2010free, reduce by 25% every 3 months). Long\u2010term seizure freedom correlates with duration of pre\u2010operative epilepsy, absence of generalized seizures, and complete resection of MRI lesion.
