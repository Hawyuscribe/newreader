CT prior to LP is only indicated when focal deficits, papilledema, or seizures are present; in a patient without papilledema CT is unnecessary. In one 2016 IDSA guideline review of 503 adults, routine CT led to delays without diagnostic yield, illustrating why waiting is incorrect in uncomplicated presentations.\\n\\nOption B: \u201cGive antibiotics directly.\u201d This is correct because early empirical antibiotics within 30 minutes of presentation reduce 30-day mortality from 25 percent to 10 percent.

The pathophysiologic rationale is that neutrophil infiltration and cytokine release escalate within 6 hours, risking irreversible brain injury. Option B addresses this window.\\n\\nOption C: \u201cPerform LP without CT.\u201d Although LP within 1 hour yields diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 95 percent, specificity 98 percent), proceeding directly to LP before antibiotics may further delay therapy in an uncooperative or comatose patient. Without antibiotics in place, LP can risk worsened sepsis. This may be considered in low-risk individuals with normal mental status, but current guidelines prioritize antibiotic delivery first.\\n\\nOption D: \u201cSupportive care only.\u201d This is never appropriate in bacterial meningitis. Without antibiotics, untreated bacterial pathogens multiply exponentially, doubling every 15\u201330 minutes, leading to fatal outcomes in >90 percent of cases.","conceptual_foundation":"The meninges consist of three layers: pia mater, arachnoid mater, and dura mater. The arachnoid and pia form the leptomeninges, through which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates in the subarachnoid space. CSF is produced by the choroid plexus in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles at 0.35 mL/min (\u2248500 mL/day). The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) rests on tight junctions of cerebral endothelial cells, astrocyte endfeet, and pericytes, regulating immune cell entry under normal physiology. Embryologically, the neural crest contributes to meningothelial cells and dura mater; neural tube closure by the fourth week influences subsequent CSF flow channels. Clinically, disruptions to the BBB in meningitis permit neutrophils and cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) to cross, leading to vasogenic edema and raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Key structures include the circle of Willis arteries in the subarachnoid cisterns, and venous dural sinuses draining CSF via arachnoid granulations. Historically, Quincke performed the first therapeutic lumbar puncture in 1891, recognizing CSF drainage relieves headache. Landmark anatomical landmarks for LP are the L3\u2013L4 or L4\u2013L5 interspaces, within the cauda equina safe zone. The evolving recognition of early antibiotic therapy versus diagnostic precision underpins modern meningitis management protocols.","pathophysiology":"In bacterial meningitis, common pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes) adhere to the choroid plexus epithelium via pili or surface proteins (e.g., pneumococcal CbpA), crossing the BBB through transcellular endocytosis. Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4) on microglia activate MyD88-dependent cascades, releasing NF-\u03baB and upregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8). These mediators increase endothelial permeability via disruption of tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-5). Neutrophils infiltrate CSF, releasing reactive oxygen species and matrix metalloproteinases, causing neuronal injury. Complement activation through C3a and C5a amplifies inflammation. Genetic polymorphisms in TLR4 and mannose-binding lectin genes modulate susceptibility. The time course proceeds: bacterial entry (0\u20134 hours), cytokine peak (4\u20138 hours), neutrophil influx and cerebral edema (8\u201324 hours), potential neuronal apoptosis (24\u201348 hours). Energy requirements in inflamed tissue rise by up to 150 percent, leading to anaerobic metabolism, lactic acidosis (CSF lactate >3.5 mmol/L). Compensatory autoregulatory vasodilation may maintain cerebral blood flow until ICP exceeds 20 mmHg, at which point perfusion pressure drops, risking herniation. These molecular and cellular processes explain why early antibiotic initiation is critical to interrupt the cascade.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms in bacterial meningitis often develop over 6\u201348 hours. Initial signs include fever (\u226538.5 \u00b0C in 85 percent of patients), headache (90 percent), and photophobia. Neck stiffness (Brudzinski\u2019s sign positive in 70 percent, Kernig\u2019s sign in 60 percent) appears within 12 hours of onset. Altered mental status ranges from confusion to coma; Glasgow Coma Scale \u226412 occurs in 40 percent. In pediatrics, irritability, poor feeding, and bulging fontanelle manifest; in the elderly, presentations may be subtle with lethargy or falls in 30 percent. Gender differences are minimal, though pregnant women exhibit higher risk of Listeria strains. Systemic features include tachycardia (heart rate >100 bpm in 75 percent) and hypotension (systolic <90 mmHg in 20 percent). Severity scales\u2014such as the Meningitis Score predicting poor outcome when score \u22654\u2014incorporate age >65, seizures at presentation, CSF glucose <0.4 of serum, and coma.

In endemic regions of sub-Saharan Africa with high HIV prevalence, studies report up to 30\u201350 percent of chronic patients developing vacuolar myelopathy after a decade of untreated infection. The pathophysiology involves vacuolation of myelin sheaths in lateral columns due to viral proteins and cytokine-mediated injury. MRI often appears normal or shows nonspecific spinal cord atrophy, making clinical correlation and CSF analysis critical. Common misconception is to assume multiple sclerosis in young women with cord signs, but absence of oligoclonal bands and MRI lesions argues against MS. Option A is definitively correct based on epidemiology, normal imaging, and geographical background.\n\nOption B (Multiple sclerosis): Multiple sclerosis typically presents in women aged 20\u201340 with relapsing\u2013remitting neurological events, MRI lesions in periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial regions, and spinal cord focal plaques. Sensory level and progressive back pain are uncommon initial manifestations. Up to 95 percent show brain MRI abnormalities on FLAIR, and 85 percent have oligoclonal bands in CSF. In normal imaging and absence of oligoclonal bands, MS is unlikely.\n\nOption C (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis): ALS presents with combined upper and lower motor neuron signs, bulbar involvement, fasciculations, and no sensory deficits. Survival is usually 3\u20135 years post onset. Imaging is normal but electrophysiology shows widespread denervation. Progressive back pain and sensory involvement would not match ALS.\n\nOption D (Spinal muscular atrophy): SMA is a genetic lower motor neuron disease manifesting in infancy or early childhood with hypotonia, muscle atrophy, and no sensory loss. Adult-onset variants are extremely rare, present with pure LMN signs, and do not cause back pain or sensory level. No African origin association.","conceptual_foundation":"The spinal cord lateral columns, specifically the corticospinal tracts and posterior columns, are primary sites affected in vacuolar myelopathy. Gross anatomy reveals these tracts originate in the motor cortex and dorsal root ganglia, respectively, descending and ascending within the cord white matter. Embryologically, the neural tube gives rise to the spinal cord segments by week 4, followed by differential proliferation of progenitor domains: the alar plate (sensory) dorsally and the basal plate (motor) ventrally. Normally, proprioceptive information travels via large myelinated fibers to the nucleus dorsalis and cerebellum, while motor signals descend to the anterior horn. Vacuolar myelopathy disrupts these myelin sheaths, impairing conduction.\n\nOther neurological conditions involving spinal cord white matter include multiple sclerosis plaques, leukodystrophies, and compressive myelopathies. Historical recognition of vacuolar myelopathy dates to the early AIDS epidemic in the 1980s when clinicians observed progressive paraparesis without MRI findings. Landmark neuropathologic studies in the 1990s characterized vacuoles in lateral columns. Key anatomical landmarks include the dorsal root entry zone, anterior median fissure, and lateral sulcus; involvement leads to sensory ataxia and spasticity. Clinical significance lies in differentiating imaging-negative cord syndromes, guiding lumbar puncture and advanced diagnostic tests.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, vacuolar myelopathy involves HIV-1 proteins such as gp120 and Tat, which bind to chemokine receptors (CXCR4, CCR5) on microglia and astrocytes. Activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK cascades leads to release of inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-1\u03b2, and glutamate, causing excitotoxicity. Oligodendrocyte dysfunction results from direct viral protein toxicity and glutamate receptor (NMDA) overactivation, leading to intramyelinic vacuole formation. Mitochondrial damage impairs ATP production and triggers reactive oxygen species. Genetic polymorphisms in CCR5 delta-32 influence susceptibility. Time course: subclinical infection may persist for months to years; vacuolation appears insidiously over 5\u201310 years of uncontrolled viral replication. Compensatory axonal sprouting initially preserves function but is limited by demyelinated segments and ongoing inflammation. Lack of effective remyelination and persistent cytokine milieu perpetuate progressive weakness and sensory deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically describe insidious onset of low back discomfort progressing over weeks to months into bilateral leg stiffness, spastic paraparesis, and pseudoathetosis due to posterior column damage. The timeline: early prodrome of fatigue and mild paresthesias at 3\u20136 months, followed by gait ataxia and leg weakness by 1\u20132 years. Neurological exam reveals increased tone (grade 3 spasticity), hyperreflexia (3+ patellar reflexes), extensor plantar responses, and impaired vibration sense below the waist. Pediatric cases are rare; adult presentations most common in 30s\u201340s; elderly may have coexisting degenerative disease. Females and males affected equally. Systemic findings include HIV-related constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fever. Severity is graded by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Neuroscore: mild (able to walk unassisted), moderate (needs support), severe (wheelchair-bound). Red flags include rapid progression (<3 months), sphincter dysfunction, or sensory level above T10. Without antiretroviral treatment, median time to wheelchair dependency is 2 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with thorough history emphasizing HIV risk factors and progressive myelopathy signs. Initial labs: HIV serology with ELISA sensitivity 99.7 percent, confirm by Western blot. Basic metabolic panel, vitamin B12 (normal >200 pg/mL), and syphilis serologies to exclude mimic conditions. MRI of brain and full spinal cord with T1, T2, STIR, and contrast sequences typically yields normal cord architecture or mild atrophy; sensitivity for demyelination in MS is 90 percent, but 0\u201310 percent in vacuolar myelopathy. CSF analysis shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (5\u201350 cells/mm3), elevated protein (50\u2013100 mg/dL), normal glucose, and HIV RNA up to 10^5 copies/mL. Oligoclonal bands are negative in 80 percent. Somatosensory evoked potentials reveal prolonged central conduction times. Differential diagnoses: MS (periventricular MRI lesions), HTLV-1\u2013associated myelopathy (anti-HTLV-1 antibodies), compressive myelopathy (identified on MRI). Exclude spinal cord compression, neoplasm with CT myelography if MRI contraindicated.","management_principles":"First-line management centers on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Initiate a regimen containing two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., tenofovir 300 mg daily plus emtricitabine 200 mg daily) and an integrase inhibitor (e.g., dolutegravir 50 mg daily). Loading doses are not required for NRTIs; emphasis is on adherence above 95 percent to prevent resistance. Monitor HIV viral load (target <50 copies/mL) at 4 weeks and CD4 count at 12 weeks. Add high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g IV daily for 5 days) if acute inflammatory component suspected. Second-line options include switching to protease inhibitors (darunavir 600 mg BID) if resistance emerges. Avoid neurotoxic agents like stavudine. Nonpharmacological measures: physiotherapy for spasticity reduction, electrical stimulation, and gait training. Surgical decompression is not indicated in noncompressive vacuolar myelopathy. Address complications: baclofen oral dosing (5 mg TID) for spasticity. In pregnancy, avoid efavirenz in first trimester; adjust doses for renal impairment (tenofovir).","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up should occur at 4\u20136 week intervals initially, then every 3 months once stable. Monitor neurological exam with spasticity scores (Modified Ashworth Scale) targeting \u22641+ for functional mobility. Laboratory surveillance includes CD4 count (normal range 500\u20131,500 cells/\u00b5L) and HIV viral load every 12 weeks until suppressed. Repeat MRI of spinal cord annually to detect progressive atrophy. Long-term complications such as motor disability occur in 40 percent of untreated cases within 5 years. Prognosis: one-year survival >90 percent with cART, five-year >80 percent. Rehabilitation needs include occupational therapy and ambulatory devices; timeline typically 6\u201312 months for maximal recovery. Educate patients on adherence, safe sex, and symptom reporting. Return to work can resume within 6 months of stabilization; driving re-evaluated based on spasticity grade and reflexes. Support is available from HIV advocacy groups such as the Global Network of People Living with HIV.","clinical_pearls":"1. In progressive paraparesis with normal MRI in an HIV-endemic region, suspect vacuolar myelopathy. 2. Normal imaging does not exclude severe cord dysfunction; rely on CSF HIV RNA levels. 3. Mnemonic VACUO: Viral proteins, Astrocyte activation, Cytokines, Uptake failure, Oligodendrocyte injury. 4. Avoid diagnosing MS without oligoclonal bands and demyelinating lesions; false positives occur in 5 percent. 5. Recent guidelines (2019 DHHS) emphasize early cART to prevent neurological complications. 6. High-dose steroids may help in acute flares but do not replace antiretrovirals. 7. Cost-effectiveness of integrase inhibitors remains high in low-resource settings. 8. Maintain physiotherapy to limit contractures and improve quality of life.","references":"1. Brew BJ, et al.
