[{"question_number":"3","question":"A young patient with congenital myasthenia gravis (MG) has a history suggestive of slow channel type. What is the recommended treatment?","options":["Pyridostigmine","3,4 DAP","Fluoxetine","Quinidine ## Page 23"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Quinidine","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D. Quinidine. Congenital slow\u2010channel myasthenic syndrome (CMS) results from gain\u2010of\u2010function mutations in the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) that prolong channel opening, causing cationic overload and endplate myopathy. Quinidine is a well\u2010established open\u2010channel blocker that reduces channel open time and ameliorates endplate injury. Multiple case series (Engel et al. 1996; Abicht et al. 2012) and in vitro patch\u2010clamp studies have demonstrated that quinidine shortens channel burst duration by 30\u201350% at therapeutic concentrations (Engel AG et al., Ann Neurol 1996, 40:192\u2013202). It remains the treatment of choice for severe slow\u2010channel CMS.\n\nOption A (Pyridostigmine) is incorrect because acetylcholinesterase inhibitors worsen slow\u2010channel CMS by increasing synaptic ACh and further prolonging channel opening; clinical reports document exacerbation of weakness and muscle pain (Molloy et al. 2000).\n\nOption B (3,4\u2010Diaminopyridine) targets presynaptic potassium channels to increase ACh release and is beneficial in Lambert\u2010Eaton myasthenic syndrome, not slow\u2010channel CMS; it has no effect on the postsynaptic channel kinetics in CMS.\n\nOption C (Fluoxetine) is an alternative open\u2010channel blocker with fewer cardiac side effects and has shown efficacy in case reports (Finlayson et al. 2008), but it is generally reserved for patients intolerant of quinidine. Quinidine remains first\u2010line based on more extensive clinical experience and larger case series.","conceptual_foundation":"Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of the neuromuscular junction classified by the affected domain: presynaptic (e.g., CHAT mutations), synaptic (e.g., COLQ mutations), and postsynaptic (e.g., AChR mutations). Slow\u2010channel CMS is due to autosomal dominant or recessive gain\u2010of\u2010function mutations in AChR subunits (CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, CHRNE) that prolong channel open time. In current nosology (ICD-11: 8A22.3), slow\u2010channel CMS falls under hereditary disorders of neuromuscular transmission. Differential diagnoses include fast\u2010channel CMS (loss\u2010of\u2010function AChR mutations), agrin\u2010related synaptic CMS, and autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Embryologically, AChR subunits are expressed early in muscle development, and mutations impair the maturation of the endplate. Postsynaptic anatomy involves the junctional folds of the muscle fiber membrane, with high\u2010density nicotinic AChRs clustered in the crest and depths of folds. Slow\u2010channel CMS is often distinguished by normal serum anti\u2010AChR antibodies and lack of thymic pathology.","pathophysiology":"Under physiologic conditions, AChR activation by ACh causes brief channel openings (mean open time ~0.5 ms) permitting Na+ influx and depolarization. In slow\u2010channel CMS, mutant AChRs exhibit prolonged mean open times (often >5 ms), leading to excessive Ca2+ influx into the postjunctional muscle membrane. Chronic Ca2+ overload triggers myofibrillar degeneration, mitochondrial proliferation, and endplate myopathy. Quinidine acts as a noncompetitive open\u2010channel blocker: it binds within the channel pore when it is open, reduces mean open time by approximately 40%, and preserves endplate structure. In contrast, fluoxetine also blocks the open channel but with ~20\u201330% less potency and a more favorable safety profile. Pyridostigmine increases ACh levels and exacerbates Ca2+ overload; 3,4\u2010DAP enhances ACh release presynaptically but does not correct postsynaptic channel kinetics.","clinical_manifestation":"Slow\u2010channel CMS typically presents in infancy or early childhood with fatigable limb, ocular, and bulbar weakness; episodic respiratory crises may occur. Muscle cramps, myalgias, and eventual fixed weakness due to endplate myopathy are common. Unlike fast\u2010channel CMS, response to pyridostigmine is poor or negative. Creatine kinase is usually normal. Single\u2010fiber EMG shows increased jitter and blocking; repetitive nerve stimulation may show a decremental response without post\u2010exercise facilitation. The natural history is of slowly progressive weakness with superimposed crises, and untreated patients often develop fixed contractures and scoliosis.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Detailed clinical history with fatigable weakness unresponsive or worsened by AChE inhibitors; neurophysiology including repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) showing a decremental response and single\u2010fiber EMG with increased jitter. Second\u2010tier: Genetic testing for AChR subunit mutations; in vitro electrophysiology of patient\u2010derived AChRs expressed in oocytes or HEK cells to confirm slow\u2010channel kinetics. Sensitivity of genetic panel testing is ~80\u201390%; specificity approaches 100%. Pretest probability is high in early\u2010onset, family history, and Pyridostigmine intolerance. Third\u2010tier: Muscle biopsy may show endplate myopathy but is not required when genetic testing is confirmatory.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy is quinidine sulfate, starting at 200 mg orally three times daily, titrating to effect (max 800 mg/day) while monitoring QTc interval. Quinidine\u2019s open\u2010channel block reduces endplate Ca2+ overload and improves strength in >70% of patients (Engel et al. 1996; Abicht et al. 2012). Adverse effects include QT prolongation, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal upset. Second\u2010line: Fluoxetine 10\u201320 mg daily for patients with cardiac contraindications to quinidine; it provides ~60% efficacy. Avoid cholinesterase inhibitors and 3,4\u2010DAP. Nonpharmacologic: Respiratory support, physiotherapy, scoliosis management. Genetic counseling is mandatory.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor ECG (QTc) at baseline, weekly during dose escalation, then quarterly. Assess muscle strength and fatigue via standardized scales (e.g., QMG score) every 3\u20136 months. Periodic blood counts and liver function tests every 6\u201312 months. Pulmonary function tests at baseline and annually. Genetic counseling update as new family members present. Adjust quinidine dosing based on efficacy and side effects; consider switch to fluoxetine if cardiotoxicity arises.","clinical_pearls":"1. Avoid pyridostigmine in suspected slow\u2010channel CMS\u2014worsening weakness is a red flag. 2. Quinidine open\u2010channel block corrects prolonged AChR kinetics and is first\u2010line\u2014monitor QTc. 3. Fluoxetine is a safer alternative in patients with cardiac risk factors but may be less potent. 4. Distinguish slow\u2010 vs. fast\u2010channel CMS by treatment response: slow\u2010channel worsens with cholinesterase inhibitors. 5. Genetic testing for AChR subunits confirms diagnosis and guides family counseling.","references":"1.

In one cohort study of 98 patients, 95% had K+ below 3.0 mmol/L at symptom onset (Smith et al. 2019). The pathophysiology involves dysfunctional sarcolemmal ion channels, leading to intracellular shift of K+. This is the correct choice because normal or elevated potassium levels would not precipitate the characteristic flaccid weakness seen in HypoPP. Misconceptions arise when subclinical myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome are considered, but those have normal or variable K+.\n\nOption B (Normal): Serum potassium remains within 3.5\u20135.0 mmol/L in conditions like hyperthyroid periodic paralysis (distinct entity), but in HypoPP, normal K+ essentially rules out the diagnosis. Rarely, very early or late in an attack, K+ may transiently hover near lower normal limits (3.2\u20133.5 mmol/L), but confirmed HypoPP episodes almost always dip below 3.0 mmol/L. Considering normal K+ could divert to disorders such as Lambert-Eaton syndrome, but those lack the rapid onset and complete flaccidity of HypoPP.\n\nOption C (High): Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis features serum K+ elevations above 5.5 mmol/L during paralysis episodes. This is a separate channelopathy (SCN4A mutations). Patients present with cramping, myotonia, or transient stiffness rather than pure flaccid paralysis. Up to 25% of HyperPP attacks follow rest after exercise, often in the morning, contrasting with HypoPP\u2019s evening or post-carbohydrate context. Choosing \u201cHigh\u201d confuses two distinct genetic disorders.\n\nOption D (Variable): Though some secondary periodic paralyses (e.g., thyrotoxic periodic paralysis) report variable K+ swings, primary HypoPP is characterized by a consistent hypokalemia. Claims of \u201cvariable\u201d may stem from mixed cohorts or misclassification of non-genetic causes. In familial HypoPP, >99% of attacks yield K+ <3.5 mmol/L. Variable levels more commonly reflect lab processing errors or artifactual hemolysis, not true physiological fluctuation.\n\nPathophysiological basis for Option A: HypoPP results from autosomal dominant mutations in CACNA1S or SCN4A altering gating currents. These mutations allow aberrant inward cationic leak that depolarizes the muscle membrane. The depolarization inactivates sodium channels, preventing action potential propagation and causing flaccid paralysis while driving K+ into cells via Na+/K+ ATPase, dropping serum levels. Misunderstanding arises when early phase extracellular K+ appears normal or when drawing labs after partial recovery. Clinical guidelines (ESHJ 2021) and multiple cohort analyses confirm the low serum K+ hallmark.","conceptual_foundation":"Skeletal muscle fibers derive embryologically from paraxial mesoderm somites, differentiating into myotomes by week 4\u20135 of gestation. Each fiber comprises parallel myofibrils ensheathed by sarcolemma and supported by transverse (T) tubules for rapid depolarization. The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) interfaces with lower motor neuron axon terminals in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, using acetylcholine (ACh) at the motor endplate to trigger endplate potentials and subsequent action potentials.\n\nThe anatomical components integral to HypoPP include the sarcolemmal voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav1.1, encoded by CACNA1S) located in the T-tubule membrane and the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.4, encoded by SCN4A). Under normal physiology, action potentials travel down T-tubules, activating Cav1.1 to facilitate excitation\u2013contraction coupling by engaging the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, releasing Ca2+ to initiate contraction.\n\nRegulation of extracellular potassium is maintained by skeletal muscle Na+/K+ ATPase pumps, balancing 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ in per ATP. During exercise, up to 20% of extracellular K+ transiently rises, then is reabsorbed into muscle cells post-exercise, returning to normal within 30\u201360 minutes.\n\nRelated channelopathies include hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (SCN4A gain-of-function) and normokalemic forms. Historically, the first descriptions date to 1902 by Kinsbourne, with genetic mutations identified in the 1990s. Landmark electrophysiological mapping studies in the early 2000s clarified aberrant gating currents. Key landmarks include the A region of the DIIIS4 voltage sensor in Cav1.1 and the DIII/DIV loop of Nav1.4.\n\nClinically, recognition of HypoPP rests on integrating embryologic origins of muscle, anatomical location of ion channels, and physiological regulation of K+ homeostasis. Precise localization aids in targeted genetic testing and personalized therapy.","pathophysiology":"Familial HypoPP is caused primarily by autosomal dominant mutations in CACNA1S (\u223c70% of cases) and SCN4A (\u223c10\u201315%). Mutations such as R528H and R1239H in CACNA1S introduce gating pore currents, permitting persistent inward cation leak at rest. This leak depolarizes the sarcolemma by 10\u201315 mV, inactivating Nav1.4 channels and preventing action potentials (Jurkat-Rott et al. 2009).\n\nAt the molecular level, the inward cation leak (aberrant channel gating current of 1\u20135 pA) activates the Na+/K+ ATPase, exchanging 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ in per ATP. This promotes rapid shift of extracellular K+ into cells, dropping serum levels by \u223c1.0\u20132.0 mmol/L within 15\u201330 minutes of onset. Serum K+ frequently falls below 2.5 mmol/L at nadir and correlates inversely with severity of paralysis (Lin et al. 2017).\n\nGenetic penetrance averages 75\u201385%, with variable expressivity. Hormonal influences, such as insulin surges post-carbohydrate meal, potentiate Na+/K+ ATPase activity, precipitating attacks. Thyroid hormones upregulate Na+/K+ ATPase subunits, explaining coexistent hyperthyroid periodic paralysis.\n\nInflammatory mediators generally are not central to primary HypoPP, but secondary inflammatory myopathies can mimic findings. Energy requirements spike during recovery, requiring increased ATP generation via glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Muscle fibers may cramp or ache when recovering due to Ca2+ reuptake.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms include upregulation of other ion channels and \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, but these are often insufficient. Repeated attacks can lead to fixed proximal myopathy over decades, likely via chronic calcium overload and mitochondrial dysfunction. The time course of acute attacks typically spans 1\u201324 hours, with most resolving within 6 hours with treatment.","clinical_manifestation":"Attacks of HypoPP typically onset in adolescence (mean age 16\u201320 years), although pediatric cases (<10 years) account for \u223c10% and late presentations (>50 years) are rare (<5%). Symptom onset usually occurs 2\u20134 hours after high-carbohydrate meals or rest following strenuous exercise. Weakness evolves over 30\u201360 minutes, peaks at 1\u20132 hours, and persists for 4\u20138 hours without treatment.\n\nNeurological examination reveals symmetric, flaccid, areflexic paralysis predominantly in proximal limbs; distal muscles are variably spared. Facial, bulbar, and respiratory muscles are generally unaffected, although severe attacks may involve respiratory muscles in \u223c2% of episodes. Sensory examination is normal. Reflexes are diminished or absent (0\u20131+), with preserved muscle tone at baseline.\n\nSeverity scales such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale grade strength from 0 to 5. Most patients present with MRC grades 0\u20132 in proximal muscles. Red flags include bulbar involvement, respiratory compromise, or autonomic instability, which mandate urgent intervention.\n\nGender differences: Males are affected 3:1, and their attacks are often more frequent and severe. Pediatric patients may present with developmental delay due to repeated episodes. Elderly patients may exhibit fixed muscle weakness from long-term myopathy. Associated systemic manifestations include hypomagnesemia (20\u201330% of cases) and, rarely, arrhythmias when K+ <2.5 mmol/L.\n\nWithout treatment, 70% of attacks resolve within 12 hours naturally, but residual weakness may persist for up to 24 hours. Recurrent episodes (average 1\u20132 per month) increase risk of permanent muscle fiber degeneration and chronic proximal myopathy over decades.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Initial serum chemistry: Measure serum potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium immediately at presentation. Sensitivity for detecting HypoPP-associated hypokalemia during attacks is 98% and specificity is 95% (per AAN 2023 guidelines). 2. ECG: Obtain 12-lead ECG to assess for hypokalemia changes (U waves, flattened T waves, QT prolongation). And watch for arrhythmias. (per AHA/ACC 2021 electrolyte management guidelines). 3. Thyroid function tests: TSH, free T4 to exclude thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 90%) (per ATA 2022 consensus).\n\n4. After initial labs, if K+ normal but high suspicion remains, perform provocative testing with oral glucose load followed by serial K+ measurements every 30 minutes for 4 hours (per European Society of Endocrinology 2022). 5. Second-line electrophysiology: Exercise testing with short exercise test and long exercise test on hand muscle with CMAP amplitude measurements pre- and post-exercise; diagnostic sensitivity 85%, specificity 92% (per International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology 2020 criteria).\n\n6.

Exclude differential diagnoses: myasthenia gravis (edrophonium test, AchR antibodies), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (nerve conduction studies), inflammatory myopathies (CK levels, MRI muscle). 8. Imaging: Only if structural CNS pathology suspected; muscle MRI may show edema post-attack (per EULAR 2023 consensus).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Acute oral potassium supplementation at 0.3\u20130.4 mEq/kg per dose (max 60 mEq) every 15\u201330 minutes until resolution; onset 30\u201360 minutes (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). If oral intolerance or severe hypokalemia (<2.5 mmol/L), give intravenous potassium chloride infusion at 0.2 mEq/kg/hr with cardiac monitoring (per AHA/ACC 2021 electrolyte guidelines).\n\nTier 2 (Second-line): Acetazolamide 250\u2013500 mg orally twice daily; start with 125 mg if renal impairment, titrate to 1,000 mg daily maximum. It induces mild metabolic acidosis, reducing Na+/K+ ATPase activity (per European Neurological Society guidelines 2022). Alternatively, dichlorphenamide 50 mg twice daily (per FDA 2019 label).\n\nTier 3 (Third-line/Refractory): For nonresponders, add spironolactone 25\u201350 mg daily or eplerenone 50\u2013100 mg daily to reduce urinary K+ loss (per Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines 2021). In extremely refractory cases, consider long-term prophylaxis with low-dose beta-blockers (propranolol 10\u201320 mg twice daily) to blunt catecholamine-driven attacks (per Mayo Clinic consensus 2020).\n\nNon-pharmacological: Low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet; avoid triggers (excessive rest after exercise) (per AAN 2022 nutrition advisory). Regular exercise programs with gradual warm-up reduce attack frequency by 30% (per American College of Sports Medicine 2023).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up intervals: After acute discharge, review weekly for first month, then monthly for 3 months, then every 6 months (per AAN 2022 follow-up recommendations).

ECG surveillance every 6 months to assess for arrhythmias.\n\nLong-term complications: Chronic proximal myopathy occurs in 30% by age 40, permanent muscle weakness in 15% by age 50. Monitor for myopathy with annual MRC strength assessment and CK levels. 5-year prognosis: >90% remain ambulatory; 10-year risk of fixed weakness is 20% (Smith et al. 2020).\n\nRehabilitation: Initiate physical therapy within 2\u20134 weeks of stabilization to maintain muscle bulk. Occupational therapy for ADL adaptations over first 6 months (per Rehabilitation Medicine Association 2021).\n\nPatient education: Teach self-monitoring of K+ with home test kits; avoidance of high-carbohydrate loads; recognition of prodromal myalgias. Driving restrictions until patient can self-correct episodes (per AAN 2022 driving advisory). Refer to support groups such as Periodic Paralysis Association.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited motor neuron disorder resulting from biallelic SMN1 gene deletions or mutations; it follows an autosomal recessive pattern but primarily affects anterior horn cells rather than muscle fibers themselves. In SMA, serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are typically normal or only mildly elevated (average <2\u00d7 upper limit of normal), whereas in primary myopathies such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), CK elevations often exceed 10\u00d7 to 100\u00d7 normal. Electromyography (EMG) in SMA demonstrates denervation potentials\u2014fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and large-amplitude, long-duration motor unit potentials due to collateral reinnervation\u2014rather than the small-amplitude, short-duration motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) with early recruitment characteristic of a myopathic pattern. The clinical presentation of progressive proximal weakness in multiple affected siblings with autosomal recessive inheritance, marked CK elevation, and myopathic EMG findings aligns with LGMD rather than SMA. Because no other options were provided, and the sole option is inconsistent with the clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiological data, the correct_answer is None.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive proximal muscle weakness with autosomal recessive inheritance suggests a primary myopathic process, most commonly limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). In the ICD-11 nosology, LGMD is categorized under \"MD36: Muscular dystrophy\" with subcategories for sarcoglycanopathies, dysferlinopathies, calpainopathies, and others. Historically, LGMD was divided into LGMD1 (autosomal dominant) and LGMD2 (autosomal recessive), though new nomenclature (LGMD R1-R23 etc.) has been adopted to reflect specific gene defects. Embryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from paraxial mesodermal somites; mutations of sarcoglycan genes disrupt the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, leading to membrane instability and increased CK leak. Neuroanatomically, the pathology is confined to muscle fibers rather than anterior horn cells or peripheral nerves. In contrast, SMA is due to degeneration of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord (neuroanatomy level: Rexed lamina IX). Genetic underpinnings differ: LGMD involves structural muscle proteins (e.g., SGCA, SGCB, SGCG, SGCD, DYSF, CAPN3), whereas SMA involves SMN1/SMN2 gene copy number. Understanding the molecular biology of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex integrity is fundamental for LGMD classification and pathogenesis.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle contraction requires an intact dystrophin-glycoprotein complex to anchor the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. In LGMD, pathogenic variants in sarcoglycan or other sarcolemmal proteins compromise membrane stability. Mechanical stress during contraction leads to sarcolemmal microtears, calcium influx, activation of proteases, and myonecrosis. CK, a cytosolic enzyme abundant in muscle, leaks into the bloodstream, causing markedly elevated CK levels (often >10,000 U/L). Repeated cycles of necrosis and regeneration exhaust satellite cell pools, culminating in fibrofatty replacement on histology. Comparatively, in SMA the SMN protein deficiency causes spliceosome dysfunction in motor neurons, resulting in selective loss of anterior horn cells, Wallerian degeneration of axons, and subsequent denervation atrophy of muscle fibers. This denervation pattern produces large-amplitude MUAPs on EMG rather than the small, brief MUAPs seen in myopathy. Cellular pathways implicated in LGMD include dysregulated calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, and activation of NF-\u03baB mediated inflammatory cascades; SMA pathophysiology centers on dysregulated RNA splicing, axonal transport defect, and neuromuscular junction dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"LGMD typically presents in late childhood to early adulthood with symmetric, slowly progressive weakness of pelvic girdle muscles\u2014manifested by difficulty rising from chairs, climbing stairs, and a waddling gait\u2014followed by shoulder girdle involvement. CK elevation ranges from 10\u00d7 to 100\u00d7 normal; CK levels correlate poorly with disease severity. Muscle pain or cramps may occur in some subtypes. Cardiac involvement (dilated cardiomyopathy) is seen in sarcoglycanopathies and dystrophinopathies. Respiratory muscle weakness can develop in later stages. In untreated natural history, ambulation is lost 10\u201320 years after symptom onset in many subtypes. SMA type 2, by contrast, presents before age 18 months with hypotonia, tongue fasciculations, feeding and respiratory difficulties; CK levels are normal to slightly elevated. Diagnostic criteria for LGMD (2020 ENMC workshop) require: (1) clinical proximal weakness; (2) elevated CK; (3) myopathic EMG; (4) dystrophic muscle biopsy or confirmed pathogenic gene variant.","diagnostic_approach":"A stepwise approach for suspected LGMD begins with baseline serum CK (sensitivity ~90% for LGMD; specificity ~85% to exclude neuropathies), followed by EMG showing short-duration (<5 ms), low-amplitude (<500 \u00b5V) MUAPs with early recruitment (sensitivity 75%, specificity 80%). Next, muscle MRI can identify a pattern of selective muscle involvement. Genetic testing via targeted next-generation sequencing panels yields a diagnostic rate of 40\u201360% in suspected LGMD (depending on panel size). Muscle biopsy remains useful in genetically unresolved cases, demonstrating fiber size variation, endomysial fibrosis, and absent or reduced sarcoglycan/dysferlin immunoreactivity. SMA diagnosis relies on multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for SMN1 deletion (sensitivity/specificity >99%). Pre-test probabilities should account for age at onset and inheritance pattern.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapies are approved for most LGMD subtypes; management is supportive. Physical therapy focusing on stretching and low-impact strengthening can delay contractures. Orthotic devices (ankle-foot orthoses) aid gait. Cardiac surveillance: echocardiography every 2 years (class IIa recommendation, level B). Respiratory monitoring: annual spirometry, sleep studies if FVC <50% predicted (grade C). Clinical trials of gene therapy (micro-dystrophin, gene transfer for sarcoglycan) are ongoing. In SMA, onasemnogene abeparvovec (AAV9-SMN1) is approved for children <2 years, providing one-time gene replacement (class I, level A). Nusinersen (an antisense oligonucleotide increasing SMN2 exon 7 inclusion) is given intrathecally every 4 months after loading (class I, level A); risdiplam (oral small molecule SMN2 splicing modifier) is approved in patients \u22652 months. Early treatment improves survival and motor milestones [Mercuri 2018 JAMA Neurol; Hagen 2020 Neurology].","follow_up_guidelines":"LGMD patients should be followed every 6 months to monitor strength, function (6-minute walk test), CK levels, and cardiac/respiratory status. Echocardiography and ECG annually or biennially depending on subtype. Vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcus are recommended (class I) to reduce respiratory complications. SMA patients require multidisciplinary visits every 3\u20136 months, assessing motor function scales (HFMSE, CHOP INTEND), pulmonary function (FVC, MIP/MEP), swallow evaluation, and scoliosis screening. Long-term surveillance for treatment-related liver toxicity (risdiplam) and platelet monitoring (nusinersen) is advised per prescribing information.","clinical_pearls":"1. Markedly elevated CK (>10\u00d7 normal) in progressive proximal weakness strongly suggests primary myopathy rather than motor neuron disease. 2. Autosomal recessive inheritance in multiple siblings with symmetric limb-girdle involvement is classic for LGMD\u2014consider sarcoglycanopathies first. 3. EMG myopathic MUAPs are short-duration, low-amplitude, with early recruitment; denervation MUAPs are large, long-duration. 4. SMA features normal or only mildly elevated CK and signs of anterior horn cell loss (fasciculations, areflexia). 5. Genetic testing has replaced muscle biopsy as first-line diagnostic tool in suspected LGMD (gene panels yield ~50% diagnostic rate).","references":"1. Emery AEH, Muntoni F, Monaco AP.

Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a mitochondrial DNA deletion disorder characterized by defective oxidative phosphorylation. Impaired complex I and complex IV function leads to reduced aerobic ATP production and shunting of pyruvate to lactate, causing elevated lactate and pyruvate levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Evidence: Studies of patients with KSS consistently demonstrate elevated resting and exercise\u2010induced lactate levels (DiMauro and Schon, 2003; Mancuso et al., 2017). Option A (serum creatine kinase) may be mildly or intermittently elevated due to muscle involvement but is neither sensitive nor specific for KSS (Dimauro et al., 2010). Option C (blood glucose) is typically normal, as KSS does not impair gluconeogenesis directly. Option D (serum calcium) is not elevated in mitochondrial myopathies and has no mechanistic basis in KSS.","conceptual_foundation":"Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome is classified under mitochondrial DNA deletion syndromes (ICD-11: 8E41), within the broader group of mitochondrial cytopathies. It presents before age 20 with progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and at least one of cardiac conduction block, cerebellar ataxia, or elevated CSF protein. Differential diagnoses include CPEO without systemic involvement, Pearson marrow\u2013pancreas syndrome (a related deletion that presents in infancy with pancytopenia), and other chronic progressive ophthalmoplegias. Mitochondrial DNA deletions in KSS typically encompass the 4977\u2010bp \u2018\u2018common deletion\u2019\u2019 region. Embryologically, mitochondria derive from the endosymbiotic incorporation of alpha\u2010proteobacteria; their heteroplasmic distribution leads to tissue\u2010specific thresholds of dysfunction. The extraocular muscles and conduction system are particularly sensitive to mitochondrial DNA depletion due to high metabolic demand. Neuroanatomically, involvement centers on cranial nerves III, IV, and VI (ophthalmoplegia) and cardiac conduction tissue (atrioventricular node). At the molecular level, large-scale deletions remove genes encoding subunits of complexes I, IV, and V, and tRNAs critical for oxidative phosphorylation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, pyruvate from glycolysis enters mitochondria and is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to acetyl-CoA, entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 feed into the electron transport chain (ETC), driving ATP synthesis. In KSS, mtDNA deletions impair ETC complexes, particularly I and IV, reducing proton gradient formation. Reduced oxidative phosphorylation forces cells to rely on anaerobic glycolysis, leading to accumulation of lactate and pyruvate in blood. Chronic energy failure in extraocular muscles and conduction tissue triggers fibrosis and conduction block. The ratio of lactate to pyruvate may also rise, reflecting redox imbalance. Comparatively, CK elevation (Option A) arises from muscle fiber breakdown but is a downstream, nonspecific marker, whereas lactate elevation directly reflects primary mitochondrial dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"KSS classically presents before age 20 with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and pigmentary retinopathy (\u2018salt-and-pepper\u2019 fundus). Additional features include complete heart block requiring pacemaker insertion (up to 50% of patients), cerebellar ataxia, short stature, sensorineural hearing loss, and elevated CSF protein. Laboratory findings include resting lactate >2 mmol/L (normal <2), lactate exercise test showing >4 mmol/L, and CSF protein >100 mg/dL. Serum CK is normal or mildly elevated (<3\u00d7 ULN) in ~30% of cases. Natural history: without pacemaker, high risk of sudden cardiac death in adolescence or early adulthood. Prognosis correlates with extent of mtDNA deletion heteroplasmy and organ systems involved.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing includes serum lactate and pyruvate levels (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%), resting and post-exercise lactate measurements, and ECG. Muscle biopsy demonstrates ragged-red fibers (Gomori trichrome) and COX-negative fibers. Second-tier: Southern blot or long\u2010range PCR of muscle mtDNA detects large deletions in >90% of KSS cases; heteroplasmy quantification aids prognosis. Third-tier: Next-generation sequencing panels for mtDNA and nuclear genes involved in mtDNA maintenance. Pretest probability in a patient with young-onset CPEO and retinopathy is >90%; a normal lactate does not exclude KSS if heteroplasmy is low. Cardiac evaluation with Holter and echocardiography is essential due to conduction system risk.","management_principles":"There is no curative therapy; management is supportive. Coenzyme Q10 (ubidecarenone) and idebenone may improve mitochondrial function (small open\u2010label trials report subjective improvement in exercise tolerance). Cardiac conduction block mandates pacemaker insertion per AHA/ACC guidelines (Class I recommendation). Endocrine surveillance (glucose tolerance, thyroid, adrenal) is recommended annually. Therapies targeting mtDNA stability (e.g., EPI\u2010743) are under investigation. Physical therapy maintains extraocular muscle range but does not reverse ophthalmoplegia. Avoidance of mitochondrial toxins (valproate, aminoglycosides) is critical.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual neurologic exam with ophthalmologic assessment, ECG, and Holter monitoring every 6 months. Serum lactate may be trended but does not correlate linearly with clinical progression. Pacemaker function checks per device guidelines every 3\u20136 months. Neuropsychological screening is advised due to risk of cognitive decline. Rehabilitation focuses on mobility and vision aids. Transition of care to adult mitochondrial disease centers improves outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1. In KSS, a CSF protein >100 mg/dL with CPEO suggests the diagnosis; this finding is rare in isolated CPEO. 2.

Up to 50% of KSS patients develop complete heart block\u2014early pacemaker prophylaxis reduces mortality. 4.

In a 2\u20135 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) study, a decremental response in the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude exceeding 10% is a hallmark of a defective neuromuscular junction. Option A is incorrect because normal neuromuscular transmission demonstrates less than 10% decrement under low\u2010frequency RNS (Brown et al. 1969). Option C (Ocular Myasthenia Gravis) is a subtype of myasthenia gravis and can show a decrement, but the test finding of >10% decrement is not specific to ocular involvement and applies broadly to any neuromuscular transmission defect. Option D (Congenital myasthenic syndrome) is also a neuromuscular transmission defect but represents a genetic subgroup; the question asks for the general category indicated by the RNS finding rather than a specific etiology. Quantitatively, low\u2010frequency RNS sensitivity for detecting a neuromuscular junction defect is approximately 60\u201380%, with specificity >95% (Rodriguez Cruz et al. 2015). Level A guideline evidence (AAN 2020) supports that >10% decrement at 3 Hz is diagnostic of a neuromuscular transmission defect.","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromuscular transmission is the process by which an action potential in a motor neuron leads to muscle fiber contraction. Key prerequisites include understanding the presynaptic release of acetylcholine (ACh), the safety factor of transmission, and the postsynaptic nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) density. In ICD-11, disorders of neuromuscular transmission are classified under \u2018Diseases of the neuromuscular junction\u2019 (MG 8A40, CMS 8A41). Differential diagnoses include primary muscle disorders (myopathies) and motor neuron diseases, which do not show a decremental RNS response. Embryologically, the neuromuscular junction arises from the interaction of neural crest\u2013derived motor neurons and myotome\u2010derived muscle fibers, with agrin\u2010MuSK signaling organizing postsynaptic receptor clusters. Major neurotransmitter: acetylcholine. Key proteins: nAChR, MuSK, rapsyn, agrin. Blood supply is via the vasa nervorum to motor endplates. Genetic studies have identified over 30 genes implicated in congenital myasthenic syndromes (CGCs), including CHAT, COLQ, and DOK7, whereas autoimmune myasthenia gravis involves anti\u2010AChR or anti\u2010MuSK antibodies.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: A single presynaptic action potential triggers Ca\u00b2\u207a influx, vesicular ACh release, activation of postsynaptic nAChRs, and an endplate potential (EPP) well above threshold (safety factor \u22482). In neuromuscular transmission defects, the safety factor falls below 1 for successive stimuli, leading to a decremental CMAP. In autoimmune myasthenia gravis, anti\u2010AChR antibodies reduce receptor density, activate complement, and cause structural damage to the postsynaptic membrane. In congenital myasthenic syndromes, mutations affect quantal release (e.g., CHAT deficiency), receptor kinetics (e.g., slow\u2010channel syndrome), or synaptic basal lamina (e.g., COLQ). Low\u2010frequency RNS exploits the decremental phenomenon: each successive stimulus releases fewer quanta or activates fewer receptors, diminishing the EPP below threshold in some fibers. Acute changes are due to antibody\u2010mediated receptor loss; chronic changes include membrane simplification. Compensatory upregulation of ACh release may transiently normalize transmission but is rapidly exhausted at 2\u20135 Hz.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with neuromuscular transmission defects present with fatigable weakness. In autoimmune myasthenia gravis, ocular muscles are often involved first (ptosis, diplopia), progressing to bulbar (dysphagia, dysarthria) and limb weakness; 85% of generalized MG show abnormal RNS in limb muscles. In congenital myasthenic syndromes, presentation can range from neonatal apnea to childhood onset of ptosis and limb weakness. Frequencies: up to 90% of MG patients have AChR antibodies; anti\u2010MuSK in 5\u201310%. Onset: MG peaks in women aged 20\u201340 and men aged 60\u201380. Natural history: without treatment, MG can progress to respiratory crisis in 10\u201315%. SFEMG has higher sensitivity (up to 95%) but lower specificity. Diagnostic criteria (AAN 2020): clinical fatigability plus abnormal RNS (>10% decrement) or SFEMG jitter.","diagnostic_approach":"First tier: low\u2010frequency RNS at 2\u20133 Hz of distal and proximal muscles (e.g., abductor digiti minimi, trapezius). A decrement >10% between first and fourth or fifth CMAP confirms a neuromuscular transmission defect (sensitivity 65%, specificity 98%). Second tier: single\u2010fiber EMG (SFEMG) jitter analysis; increased jitter in >10% fiber pairs (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%). Third tier: serologic testing for AChR and MuSK antibodies (AChR Ab sensitivity 85%, specificity 96%; MuSK Ab sensitivity 40%, specificity 99%), genetic testing for CMS panels. Pretest probability is guided by clinical fatigable weakness; post\u2010test probability with decrement >10% rises to >90%. In resource\u2010limited settings, RNS is the primary tool. Novel techniques: high\u2010density surface EMG correlation with RNS (under investigation).","management_principles":"Treatment focuses on improving safety factor and reducing autoimmune destruction.
