[{"question_number":"5","question":"A 61-year-old male with a 2-year history of limb tremors and bradykinesia has postural instability and vertical jaw limitation on exam. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Corticobasal degeneration (CBD)","Multiple system atrophy (MSA)","Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD)","Parkinson's disease (PD) ## Page 15"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Corticobasal degeneration (CBD)","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is correct. CBD presents with asymmetric limb rigidity, bradykinesia, cortical signs (apraxia, alien limb), postural instability, and orobuccal motor impairment including vertical jaw limitations. Prevalence of CBD is estimated at 4\u20137 per 100,000 persons over age 60 (Litvan et al. 2011). Pathologically, CBD is a 4R tauopathy affecting frontoparietal cortex and basal ganglia, leading to asymmetric neuronal loss and astrocytic plaques (Dickson et al. 2002). Common misperceptions include confusing vertical gaze palsy with progressive supranuclear palsy but CBD often shows limb apraxia and cortical sensory loss (Hauw et al. 1994).\nOption B: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) typically manifests with autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension >20\u2009mm\u2009Hg drop), cerebellar ataxia, and parkinsonism but rarely jaw limitation or cortical signs. MSA prevalence is 3.4 per 100,000; MRI shows the \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign in pons (Wenning et al. 2004).\nOption C: Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is an amnestic dementia due to \u03b2-amyloid and tau deposition in limbic cortex, presenting with memory loss, not parkinsonism or cortical motor deficits. CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio is reduced (~50\u201370\u2009pg/mL) (McKhann et al. 2011).\nOption D: Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) features resting tremor (4\u20136\u2009Hz), rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability but responds to levodopa; cortical signs and vertical jaw limitation are absent. PD incidence is 15\u201318 per 100,000/year (de Lau & Breteler 2006).\nMisdiagnosis often results from overlapping rigidity and bradykinesia, but cortical features and tau pathology confirm CBD.","conceptual_foundation":"Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) arises from pathological tau accumulation in the frontoparietal cortex, basal ganglia (globus pallidus, putamen), subthalamic nucleus, and brainstem nuclei. The primary affected pathways include the corticospinal tract, frontostriatal circuits, and thalamocortical projections. Embryologically, these structures derive from the dorsal telencephalon and lateral ganglionic eminence. Normal physiology involves modulatory dopaminergic input from substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum, balanced by glutamatergic cortico-striatal excitation and GABAergic striatal output. CBD overlaps clinically and pathologically with progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia syndromes, all tauopathies. Historically, Rebeiz et al. first described corticobasal ganglionic degeneration in 1968; in 1999, Armstrong et al. provided revised clinical research criteria. Anatomical landmarks such as the precentral gyrus, superior frontal sulcus, and the parietal operculum correlate with apraxia and sensory deficits. Clinically significant atrophy on MRI appears asymmetrically in peri-rolandic cortex, underlying the alien limb phenomenon and limb \u201cuselessness.\u201d Understanding these regions guides differential diagnoses; for example, parietal lobe lesions produce astereognosis but CBD adds movement disorders due to basal ganglia involvement.","pathophysiology":"CBD is characterized by abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), specifically accumulating four-repeat (4R) isoforms. Molecularly, kinases such as GSK-3\u03b2 and CDK5 phosphorylate tau at Serine202/Threonine205 epitopes, disrupting microtubule stability. Accumulated tau forms neuronal and glial inclusions, particularly astrocytic plaques and oligodendroglial coiled bodies. Cellularly, this leads to impaired axonal transport, synaptic dysfunction, and eventual neuronal apoptosis mediated by caspase-3 activation. Genetic studies identify rare MAPT mutations (e.g., P301L) in familial cases (Hutton et al. 1998). Inflammatory mediators including microglial TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 exacerbate neuronal injury. Energy metabolism is compromised by mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced Complex I activity. Pathological changes begin years before clinical presentation; neurofibrillary tangles accumulate in layer V of the cortex by mid-fifties, with compensatory sprouting and synaptic adaptation delaying symptoms until the sixth decade. However, compensatory upregulation of surviving dopaminergic neurons eventually fails, resulting in unilateral rigidity and apraxia. The time course is progressive, averaging 6\u20138 years from onset to severe disability due to widespread tau pathology and network disintegration.","clinical_manifestation":"CBD typically presents between ages 55 and 70, with an average onset at 63 years. Early symptoms include unilateral limb clumsiness, rigidity, and bradykinesia that progress over 6\u201312 months. By year two, most patients exhibit postural instability, asymmetric cortical sensory loss (impaired two-point discrimination), and ideomotor apraxia. Vertical jaw limitation and dystonic tongue protrusion appear in 40% of cases by year three. The neurological exam reveals positive Myerson\u2019s sign in 25% of patients, limb kinetic apraxia, and alien limb phenomenon. Elderly patients may also develop cognitive deficits, particularly executive dysfunction, with MMSE scores dropping 3\u20135 points per year. Gender differences are minimal though men may exhibit faster motor decline. Systemic features are rare, though some develop weight loss secondary to dysphagia. Severity scales include the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale motor subsection (UPDRS-III) and the Frontotemporal Dementia Rating Scale (FTD-RS). Red flags include rapid asymmetry, cortical sensory signs, and poor levodopa response. Without treatment, natural history results in wheelchair dependence by year four and mortality at 6\u20138 years from onset, often due to aspiration pneumonia and falls.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical assessment with detailed history emphasizing asymmetric rigidity, apraxia, and postural instability (per Armstrong et al. 2013 criteria). Step 2: First-line MRI brain with T1 and FLAIR sequences reveals asymmetric cortical atrophy in peri-rolandic region with sensitivity ~82% and specificity ~88% for CBD (per AAN 2021 guidelines). Step 3: DaTscan (123I-ioflupane SPECT) demonstrates reduced striatal uptake contralateral to affected side; sensitivity 90%, specificity 85% (per EAN 2020 consensus). Step 4: Laboratory evaluation including CBC, metabolic panel, thyroid, B12, and ceruloplasmin to exclude metabolic mimics (all normal ranges) (per MDS 2018 guidelines). Step 5: Consider CSF analysis: tau total elevated (>500\u2009pg/mL) and phosphorylated tau (>60\u2009pg/mL), A\u03b242 normal or mildly reduced; cell count 0\u20135 cells/mm3, protein 15\u201345\u2009mg/dL (per Alzheimer\u2019s Association 2018 criteria). Step 6: Electrophysiology (EMG/NCS) to rule out peripheral neuropathy; typically normal (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Differential diagnoses include PSP (marked vertical gaze palsy, midbrain atrophy), MSA (autonomic failure, hot cross bun sign), and PD (levodopa responsiveness). Diagnostic certainty is based on clinical\u2013imaging concordance (Armstrong et al. 2013).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Physical and occupational therapy focused on proprioceptive training and dystonia stretching 3\u00d7/week (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Levodopa trial up to 1,000\u2009mg/day in divided doses yields mild benefit in rigidity (per MDS Evidence-Based Review 2019). Tier 2 (Second-line): Botulinum toxin A injections (100\u2013200\u2009units) for focal dystonia every 12 weeks (per EFNS guidelines 2020). Rivastigmine 4.6\u2009mg/24\u2009h patch, titrated to 9.5\u2009mg/24\u2009h for cognitive symptoms (per NICE 2021). Tier 3 (Third-line): Deep brain stimulation targeting globus pallidus internus, indicated for refractory dystonia and rigidity; success rate ~50% motor improvement at 6 months (per Movement Disorder Society consensus 2022). Off-label amantadine 100\u2009mg TID may reduce rigidity and dyskinesia, monitor renal function (per AAN 2022). Non-pharmacological adjuncts include contralateral sensory tricks and mirror therapy. Monitor CBC, LFTs every 3 months for rivastigmine; adjust doses in renal insufficiency. For botulinum toxin, observe for weak swallowing. Surgical options reserved for refractory cases after Tier 2 failure, with multidisciplinary evaluation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should return every 3 months during the first year for motor and cognitive assessment using UPDRS-III and MoCA scores, targeting <5-point decline annually (per AAN 2022 follow-up guidelines). Imaging surveillance with MRI repeated every 12\u201318 months monitors atrophy progression. Laboratory monitoring includes quarterly CBC and LFTs when on cholinesterase inhibitors and annual metabolic panels. Long-term complications include falls (incidence 75% by year three) and aspiration pneumonia (incidence 40% by year four). Five-year survival is approximately 25% (mean survival 6.5 years). Early engagement with physical therapy reduces fall risk by 30% (per Cochrane Review 2020). Patient education focuses on home safety, swallowing precautions, and caregiver support. Driving cessation is recommended once UPDRS-III exceeds 40 or Montreal Cognitive Assessment <18 (per AAA 2019 guidelines). Referral to support groups such as the CBD Support Network and the Parkinson\u2019s Foundation is advised. Advance care planning should be initiated early, including palliative care involvement by year two.","clinical_pearls":"1. Remember \u201cALIEN LIMB\u201d for CBD: Asymmetric Limb Incoordination, Ideomotor apraxia, Elevation, Neglect \u2013 Limb. 2.

What should be done?","options":["Increase dose of Sinemet","Add Amantadine","Decrease dose of Sinemet","Add COMT inhibitor"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Add Amantadine","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Add Amantadine. In patients with long-standing Parkinson\u2019s disease on chronic levodopa who develop peak-dose dyskinesias while still experiencing end-of-dose wearing-off (bradykinesia, depressed mood, OFF-period symptoms), the optimal strategy is to add amantadine. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses (Level A evidence, AAN 2018) demonstrate that amantadine, an NMDA-receptor antagonist, reduces the severity and duration of levodopa-induced dyskinesias by approximately 30\u201350%, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3\u20135 to achieve a 30% reduction in dyskinesia burden (Oertel et al. 2017, Fox et al. 2018).\n\nOption A (Increase dose of Sinemet) is incorrect: increasing levodopa will worsen peak-dose dyskinesias and is contraindicated when dyskinesias are severe. Option C (Decrease dose of Sinemet) would reduce dyskinesias but aggravate OFF-period bradykinesia and nonmotor OFF symptoms (depressed mood, anxiety). Option D (Add COMT inhibitor) can prolong ON time and reduce wearing-off but also increases levodopa bioavailability and often exacerbates dyskinesia. Thus, only amantadine targets dyskinesia without sacrificing dopaminergic efficacy or worsening OFF symptoms.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is classified in ICD-11 under code 8A00 as a degenerative disease of the basal ganglia characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Clinically, PD manifests with cardinal motor features\u2014bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, postural instability\u2014and numerous nonmotor features, including mood disorders, cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, and sleep disturbances. The mainstay of symptomatic therapy is levodopa, usually co-administered with carbidopa (Sinemet) to inhibit peripheral decarboxylation. Chronic levodopa leads to pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation, which induces motor complications: \u201cwearing-off\u201d (predictable end-of-dose deterioration) and dyskinesias (involuntary hyperkinetic movements during peak levodopa effect).\n\nFrom an embryological standpoint, dopaminergic neurons originate from the ventral mesencephalon; their degeneration disrupts nigrostriatal pathways. Basal ganglia circuitry involves a direct (facilitatory) pathway via D1 receptors and an indirect (inhibitory) pathway via D2 receptors. Dopamine depletion causes overactivity of the indirect pathway and underactivity of the direct pathway, yielding bradykinesia and rigidity. Pulsatile levodopa further induces maladaptive synaptic plasticity, sensitizing dopamine and glutamate receptors in the striatum. Amantadine\u2019s mechanism\u2014NMDA antagonism\u2014addresses the glutamatergic overactivity underlying dyskinesia without altering dopaminergic dosing.","pathophysiology":"In health, dopamine release from nigrostriatal neurons modulates the balance between basal ganglia direct and indirect pathways to regulate movement. In PD, loss of these neurons leads to excessive activity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal globus pallidus (GPi), causing hypokinetic motor signs. Levodopa temporarily restores dopaminergic tone but, when given in intermittent pulses, results in exaggerated fluctuations in synaptic dopamine, provoking downstream changes: upregulation of glutamatergic NMDA receptors, alterations in striatal gene expression (e.g., FosB), and aberrant firing patterns in pallidal and nigral neurons. Peak-dose dyskinesia corresponds to times of maximal synaptic dopamine and is mediated through excessive D1-mediated facilitation in the direct pathway coupled with glutamatergic hyperactivity. Amantadine binds NMDA receptors on striatal and pallidal neurons, reducing glutamate excitotoxicity and abnormal firing, thus decreasing dyskinesia tremor and choreiform movements.","clinical_manifestation":"Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) typically emerge 5\u201310 years into therapy, affecting up to 50% of patients. They present as choreiform, dystonic, or ballistic movements peaking when plasma levodopa concentrations are highest. Motor fluctuations\u2014wearing-off\u2014occur when levodopa\u2019s half-life (1.5\u20132 hours) becomes insufficient to sustain dopaminergic tone, producing predictable OFF periods characterized by reemergence of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and nonmotor symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, and autonomic signs. The coexistence of peak-dose dyskinesia and wearing-off OFF phenomena\u2014termed complex motor fluctuations\u2014requires careful balancing of dopaminergic therapy to maximize ON time without provoking dyskinesia.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias is clinical. First-tier evaluation includes a detailed patient diary documenting ON/OFF times and dyskinesia severity, along with the Movement Disorder Society\u2013Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts III\u2013IV. Sensitivity of such diaries exceeds 85%, and specificity is >90% for detecting wearing-off and dyskinesia. Second-tier tools include the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) and wearable sensors for objective quantification. Imaging with DAT-SPECT may confirm nigrostriatal deficit if atypical features exist (Level B evidence). Pretest probability for motor complications in long-term levodopa therapy is high (>70%), so confirmatory testing is rarely needed.","management_principles":"Managing LID involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. First, fractionate levodopa dosing\u2014reduce individual dose size and increase dosing frequency\u2014to smooth plasma levels and lessen peaks. However, fractionation alone often fails to control moderate to severe dyskinesias. Amantadine (100\u2013200 mg daily in divided doses) is recommended (Class I, Level A) by AAN guidelines to reduce LID severity by 30\u201350% (NNT 3\u20135). Monitor for side effects: hallucinations, peripheral edema, livedo reticularis. Alternative pharmacotherapies (off-label) include clozapine for refractory dyskinesia. For refractory motor complications despite optimized medical therapy, consider advanced therapies: deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN or GPi, continuous levodopa infusion (Duopa), or apomorphine pump.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients started on amantadine should be monitored every 3\u20136 months for efficacy (reduction in UDysRS score by \u226530%) and tolerability. Renal function should be checked annually, as amantadine is renally cleared. Routine assessment of motor diaries and MDS-UPDRS Part IV guides further titration. Evaluate for nonmotor OFF symptoms and cognitive side effects quarterly. In cases of tachyphylaxis or intolerable side effects, taper amantadine over 1 week and consider DBS referral for persistent fluctuations or dyskinesias.","clinical_pearls":"1. Peak-dose dyskinesias arise at levodopa plasma peaks and respond best to amantadine (NMDA antagonism). Remember: \u201cAmantadine for the dance\u201d to recall dyskinesia treatment. 2. Fractionating levodopa doses smooths fluctuations but often needs adjunctive therapy\u2014consider COMT/MAO-B inhibitors for OFF time but watch for dyskinesia exacerbation. 3. Wearing-off nonmotor symptoms (depression, anxiety) often parallel motor OFF periods; treating wearing-off improves mood fluctuations. 4. COMT inhibitors prolong levodopa half-life but may worsen dyskinesia\u2014avoid adding when dyskinesias are severe. 5. Advanced therapies (DBS, Duopa) are indicated when optimized medical management fails; DBS of GPi can specifically ameliorate dyskinesias.","references":"1. Oertel W, et al.

Dopamine transporter scan. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 123I-ioflupane is the most widely validated investigation to distinguish presynaptic parkinsonian syndromes (such as Parkinson\u2019s disease) from non-degenerative causes of tremor. A 2014 meta-analysis (Brooks 2014) reported pooled sensitivity of 98% (95% CI 95\u201399%) and specificity of 95% (92\u201397%) for DAT SPECT in diagnosing Parkinson\u2019s disease versus essential tremor or drug-induced parkinsonism. Option A (\u201cDopaminergic imaging\u201d) is nonspecific: it may refer to PET or SPECT but lacks the specificity of DAT SPECT in quantifying presynaptic transporter density. Option C (MRI of the brain) can exclude structural lesions or atypical parkinsonian features (e.g., multiple system atrophy with hot cross bun sign) but is neither sensitive nor specific for early Parkinson\u2019s disease. Option D is incomplete. No credible evidence supports it as the primary diagnostic test for asymmetric resting tremor. Common misconceptions include overreliance on clinical examination alone in early parkinsonism and misinterpreting nonspecific MRI signal changes as diagnostic.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinsonian syndromes fall under the movement disorders category (ICD-11 8A00.0). Key prerequisite concepts include presynaptic dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta, downstream striatal dopamine depletion, and compensatory changes in basal ganglia circuitry. Differential diagnoses for asymmetric tremor include essential tremor, drug-induced parkinsonism, dystonic tremor, and psychogenic tremor. Historically, parkinsonism was first described by James Parkinson in 1817. Nosologically, Parkinson\u2019s disease is classified in DSM-5-TR under neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson\u2019s disease when cognitive impairment is present. Embryologically, midbrain dopaminergic neurons originate from the ventral mesencephalon around week 5\u20136 of gestation. Neuroanatomically, the nigrostriatal pathway conveys dopamine from substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum; degeneration leads to disinhibition of the indirect pathway, causing bradykinesia and rigidity. The primary neurotransmitter is dopamine, regulated by the DAT protein on presynaptic terminals. Blood supply to the substantia nigra arises from the posterior cerebral artery perforators.","pathophysiology":"Normal movement requires balanced activity of the direct (facilitatory) and indirect (inhibitory) basal ganglia pathways. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, selective degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons reduces dopamine availability, leading to overactivity of the indirect pathway and underactivity of the direct pathway. At a molecular level, alpha-synuclein aggregation forms Lewy bodies, triggering mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Loss of DAT expression on presynaptic terminals results in reduced tracer uptake on DAT SPECT. This contrasts with essential tremor, where dopaminergic neurons and DAT density remain intact. Asymmetric onset reflects focal vulnerability of nigrostriatal projections. Compensatory upregulation of dopamine receptors may mask early deficits. Over time, symptomatic threshold is crossed and classic motor signs emerge.","clinical_manifestation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease typically presents with resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. Resting tremor affects 70\u201375% of patients at onset, is asymmetric in ~80%, and often involves a distal limb (\u201cpill-rolling\u201d). Bradykinesia is present in nearly all cases. Rigidity is cogwheel or lead-pipe in character. Nonmotor prodromes include hyposmia (up to 90% prevalence), REM sleep behavior disorder (50%), and constipation. Variants include tremor-dominant and akinetic-rigid subtypes, with differing progression rates. In untreated cases, gait freezing and falls typically emerge within 5\u201310 years. Diagnostic criteria (MDS-2015) require bradykinesia plus either tremor or rigidity, supportive imaging, and exclusion of red flags such as early autonomic failure without parkinsonism.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation is clinical: history and neurological examination. When diagnosis is uncertain, DAT SPECT is recommended (MDS Level A evidence). Sensitivity 98% and specificity 95% distinguish presynaptic parkinsonism from non-degenerative tremor. Pretest probability in a movement disorder clinic is ~85%, post-test probability with a positive DAT SPECT approaches 99%. MRI is second-tier to rule out atypical features. PET with 18F-DOPA is research-level due to cost and limited availability. In resource-limited settings, clinical diagnostic criteria may suffice. False negatives can occur in very early disease (<2 years duration). Interpretation requires nuclear medicine expertise to avoid artefacts.","management_principles":"Management begins with pharmacotherapy: levodopa plus peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa) is first-line (AAN 2018 Level A). Starting dose 100 mg levodopa thrice daily, titrated to effect. Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole) are alternatives, especially in younger patients, to delay motor complications. MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline) can be used in early disease. COMT inhibitors (entacapone) prolong levodopa effect. Nonpharmacological: physical therapy for gait and balance, speech therapy for dysarthria.

Multiple randomized controlled trials and guideline statements from the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (2019) and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN, 2021) recommend initiating dopaminergic therapy in patients with clinically probable Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) presenting with the classic triad of resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Levodopa combined with carbidopa remains the most effective symptomatic therapy, with trials showing a 30\u201350% improvement in Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores (PD MED trial, 2014; odds ratio for meaningful clinical response 2.1, 95% CI 1.5\u20132.9). PET scanning (option B) may demonstrate nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficiency but is not required for routine diagnosis or initial management in typical presentations and is reserved for atypical or uncertain cases (AAN practice parameter, 2018). B is incorrect because PET imaging has high sensitivity but low specificity in differentiating PD from other parkinsonian syndromes, and its cost and availability limit its use as a first step.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Diagnostic criteria (MDS Clinical Diagnostic Criteria, 2015) emphasize the presence of bradykinesia plus either resting tremor or rigidity, supported by responsiveness to dopaminergic therapy and absence of exclusionary features. In the ICD-11 classification (code 8A00), idiopathic PD falls under extrapyramidal and movement disorders. Differential diagnoses include atypical parkinsonism (multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy) and drug-induced parkinsonism. Embryologically, midbrain dopaminergic neurons derive from the floor plate of the mesencephalon, with patterning influenced by SHH and WNT signaling. Neuroanatomically, the nigrostriatal pathway projects from substantia nigra to putamen, modulating the basal ganglia direct and indirect pathways via D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. Dopamine depletion leads to increased indirect pathway activity and reduced direct pathway facilitation, manifesting as akinesia and rigidity.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons tonically inhibit the indirect pathway and facilitate the direct pathway of basal ganglia circuitry to promote movement. In PD, misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates (Lewy bodies) trigger mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and proteasomal impairment, leading to progressive dopaminergic cell death. Neuroinflammation mediated by microglial activation further exacerbates neuronal loss. Loss of striatal dopamine increases GABAergic inhibitory output from the internal globus pallidus to the thalamus, resulting in reduced thalamocortical excitation and clinical bradykinesia and rigidity. Levodopa is converted to dopamine by aromatic L\u2010amino acid decarboxylase in surviving neurons, restoring dopaminergic tone. Carbidopa inhibits peripheral decarboxylation, increasing central availability and reducing peripheral side effects such as nausea.","clinical_manifestation":"Idiopathic PD typically presents after age 60 with asymmetrical resting tremor (4\u20136 Hz), rigidity (cogwheel or lead-pipe), and bradykinesia. Nonmotor features\u2014anosmia (80%), REM sleep behavior disorder (50%), constipation (70%), and depression (30%)\u2014may precede motor signs by years. The MDS UPDRS quantifies symptom severity; scores >20 correlate with moderate disease. Subtypes include tremor-dominant and postural instability\u2013gait difficulty phenotypes, with differing progression rates. Untreated, patients typically lose 50\u201370% of nigral neurons before motor signs emerge, with annual motor UPDRS progression of 3\u20136 points. Early levodopa initiation improves quality of life and functional independence.","diagnostic_approach":"The clinical diagnosis of PD relies on history and examination. No biomarker is required in straightforward cases. First-tier: neurological exam assessing bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural stability. Scales: MDS UPDRS (sensitivity 89%, specificity 96%). Second-tier: dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT may be used when diagnosis is uncertain (sensitivity 97%, specificity 94%). Third-tier: PET imaging (e.g., 18F\u2010DOPA) reserved for research or atypical presentations. Routine labs and MRI to exclude mimics (normal in PD). Pretest probability in a typical elderly patient with unilateral tremor and rigidity is >85%, making imaging low yield.","management_principles":"Initial pharmacotherapy aims to improve motor function and quality of life. Levodopa/carbidopa is first-line in patients >65 or with significant functional impairment (AAN, 2021; Class I evidence). Start at 100/25 mg three times daily, titrate every 1\u20132 weeks. Expected benefit: 30\u201350% UPDRS motor score improvement; NNT ~4 for clinical response. Adverse effects: motor fluctuations (wearing-off), dyskinesias (20% at 5 years), orthostatic hypotension, nausea. MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline) may be used in mild cases or as adjuncts. Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole) can delay levodopa\u2010induced motor complications but have higher risk of impulse control disorders. COMT inhibitors (entacapone) extend levodopa half-life. Deep brain stimulation is reserved for advanced, medication-refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3\u20136 months to assess motor response, nonmotor symptoms, and side effects. Monitor UPDRS scores, quality-of-life measures, and medication adherence. Adjust levodopa dosage based on wearing-off symptoms; consider addition of COMT or MAO-B inhibitors. Screen annually for cognitive decline, orthostatic hypotension, and dyskinesias. Physical therapy and exercise should be continued long-term. Referral to multidisciplinary teams (speech therapy for dysarthria, occupational therapy for ADL training) is recommended. Prognosis: median time to Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 is ~5\u20137 years.","clinical_pearls":"1. Asymmetry is a hallmark of idiopathic PD\u2014unilateral onset tremor should raise suspicion. 2. Levodopa remains the gold standard despite concerns about long-term dyskinesias. 3. Nonmotor features often precede motor signs by years\u2014screen for REM sleep behavior disorder. 4. DAT SPECT can aid diagnosis when exam findings are equivocal. 5. Early multidisciplinary care (PT/OT/speech) improves function and quality of life.","references":"1. Reich SG, Savitt JM.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Multiple system atrophy","Corticobasal degeneration","Progressive supranuclear palsy"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Corticobasal degeneration","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is characterized by asymmetric limb apraxia, the alien limb phenomenon, and cortical sensory deficits including visuospatial dissociation, often accompanied by cognitive decline. In this patient, involuntary left upper limb movement with visuospatial dissociation and memory impairment strongly point toward a cortical basal syndrome rather than primarily subcortical or brainstem pathology. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) typically presents with parkinsonism or cerebellar ataxia plus prominent autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence) without cortical signs. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) manifests with early postural instability, vertical gaze palsy, axial rigidity, and frontal cognitive decline but lacks the characteristic alien limb and marked apraxia of CBD. Therefore, option B is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Corticobasal degeneration is a sporadic, adult-onset tauopathy classified under movement disorders in ICD-11 (8D43) and recognized clinically as corticobasal syndrome. First described by Rebeiz et al. in 1968, CBD exists within the spectrum of 4R tauopathies alongside progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. It involves both cortical (particularly parietal and frontal lobes) and basal ganglia degeneration, leading to a unique combination of cortical and extrapyramidal features. Differential diagnoses include Alzheimer\u2019s disease (posterior cortical atrophy variant), PSP, MSA, and other atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Historically, CBD was once conflated with Alzheimer\u2019s due to overlapping cognitive symptoms, but advances in immunohistochemistry and neuroimaging have clarified its distinct pathology. Embryologically, affected cortical regions derive from the dorsal pallium; basal ganglia components originate from the lateral ganglionic eminence, highlighting disrupted corticobasal connectivity in CBD. Neuroanatomically, degeneration in primary sensory and motor cortices, supplementary motor areas, and frontoparietal association regions underlies the hallmark signs of apraxia and alien limb, while tau pathology in globus pallidus and substantia nigra contributes to rigidity and bradykinesia. At the molecular level, hyperphosphorylated 4R tau aggregates in neurons and astrocytes (astrocytic plaques), with MAPT gene regulation abnormalities implicated in sporadic and familial cases.","pathophysiology":"Normal tau protein stabilizes microtubules in neurons. In CBD, aberrant phosphorylation of tau\u2014predominantly the 4-repeat isoforms\u2014leads to misfolding, aggregation, and neurotoxicity. Cellular mechanisms include impaired axonal transport, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and activation of microglial inflammatory pathways. Aggregates form astrocytic plaques and neuronal tangles predominantly in frontoparietal cortex and basal ganglia. This disrupts corticocortical and corticosubcortical circuits: degeneration of parietal neurons impairs sensory integration causing cortical sensory loss and visuospatial deficits; involvement of premotor and supplementary motor areas leads to ideomotor apraxia and alien limb phenomena via abnormal interhemispheric disinhibition. Basal ganglia tau pathology contributes to rigidity and bradykinesia by altering direct and indirect pathway balance. Chronically, compensatory synaptic plasticity initially maintains function, but progressive neuronal loss leads to decompensation and the emergence of overt clinical features over 5\u20137 years. Comparatively, PSP involves 4R tau in brainstem and frontal lobes causing vertical gaze palsy and falls, while MSA features \u03b1-synuclein pathology in oligodendrocytes rather than tau in neurons and astrocytes.","clinical_manifestation":"CBD typically presents between ages 60\u201370 with asymmetric limb rigidity, dystonia, myoclonus, and apraxia. The alien limb phenomenon, in which a limb moves involuntarily with a sense of foreignness, occurs in ~60% of cases. Cortical sensory deficits (astereognosis, visuospatial neglect) occur in ~80%, while cognitive impairment\u2014especially executive dysfunction and visuospatial dyscalculia\u2014affects ~50%. Mean disease duration is ~7 years. Subtypes include the classical corticobasal syndrome (CBS) with predominant cortical signs versus a parkinsonian variant with bradykinesia and rigidity. Natural history without disease-modifying therapy involves progressive worsening of motor and cognitive functions, leading to loss of independent ambulation by 4\u20135 years and severe disability by year 7. Diagnostic criteria (Armstrong et al., 2013) require asymmetric presentation with two of: limb rigidity/akinesia, limb dystonia, limb myoclonus; plus two cortical features: apraxia, cortical sensory deficit, alien limb. Sensitivity ~75%, specificity ~85%.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured approach begins with clinical criteria (Armstrong et al., 2013) to identify possible or probable CBD. First-tier: detailed neurological exam focusing on asymmetry, apraxia, myoclonus, and cortical sensory deficits. MRI brain classically shows asymmetric frontoparietal atrophy; sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~70%. FDG-PET reveals hypometabolism in the affected hemisphere\u2019s parietal cortex. DaTscan is often normal or mildly reduced contralaterally, helping differentiate from PD (marked reduction) and MSA. Second-tier: exclude alternative diagnoses with autonomic testing (to rule out MSA), vertical gaze assessment (PSP), and CSF biomarkers (amyloid-\u03b2, tau profile) to exclude Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. Third-tier: advanced PET tracers targeting tau (e.g., [18F]PI-2620) are investigational but show promise in distinguishing tauopathies (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~88%).","management_principles":"No disease-modifying treatments exist. Symptomatic pharmacotherapy includes clonazepam (0.5\u20132 mg nightly) for myoclonus (response ~60%), botulinum toxin injections (50\u2013100 U) for dystonia, and levodopa trials (up to 1,500 mg/day) for parkinsonism (limited benefit in ~15%). Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., rivastigmine 3\u201312 mg/day) may modestly improve cognitive symptoms. Nonpharmacological interventions\u2014physical therapy to maintain mobility, occupational therapy for apraxia, and speech therapy for dysphagia\u2014are essential. Multidisciplinary care following EFNS guidelines emphasizes early rehabilitation and fall prevention. Investigational tau-targeting agents (e.g., anti-tau monoclonal antibodies) are under phase II\u2013III trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Routine follow-up every 3\u20136 months to assess motor progression, adjust symptomatic therapies, and monitor complications (falls, dysphagia, contractures). Annual cognitive evaluations using tools like MoCA. Imaging follow-up not routinely indicated unless diagnostic uncertainty persists. Physical and occupational therapy assessments should occur quarterly. Nutrition and swallowing assessments every 6 months. End-of-life planning and palliative care discussions early in disease course are recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1) Alien limb phenomenon is a hallmark high-specificity sign of CBD\u2014distinguishes it from PSP and MSA. 2) Asymmetric cortical sensory loss (astereognosis) and visuospatial neglect guide towards a cortical etiology. 3) MRI demonstrating asymmetric frontoparietal atrophy supports diagnosis; FDG-PET hypometabolism increases specificity. 4) Limited response to levodopa (<15%) helps differentiate CBD from Parkinson\u2019s disease. 5) CBD is a 4R tauopathy\u2014understanding tau isoform pathology is critical for interpreting emerging tau PET tracers and therapeutic trials.","references":"1.
