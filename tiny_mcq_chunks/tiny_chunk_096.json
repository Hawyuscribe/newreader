In extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection with mural hematoma (crescent sign on MRA), randomized trials (CADISS) have shown no significant difference in stroke recurrence between antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. Thus, medical management with aspirin or anticoagulation is first-line. There is no indication for immediate surgery or stent placement unless there is ongoing ischemia or expanding pseudoaneurysm causing compression.","conceptual_foundation":"Arterial dissection involves intimal tear with intramural hematoma between media and adventitia. In carotid dissections, this can lead to thromboembolism or hemodynamic compromise. The crescent-shaped hyperintense signal on T1-weighted MRA indicates subacute hematoma. Management aims to prevent embolic stroke by reducing thrombosis.","pathophysiology":"Following intimal tear, blood dissects into the media, forming a false lumen. Thrombus may form at the site and embolize distally. Medical therapy (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) prevents thrombus propagation. Healing of the vessel wall occurs over weeks to months via remodeling and re-endothelialization.","clinical_manifestation":"ICA dissection in young patients often presents with ipsilateral neck pain or headache, Horner\u2019s syndrome, and cerebral or retinal ischemia (amaurosis fugax, TIA, stroke). In the CADISS cohort (N=250), 45% presented with stroke, 29% with TIA, and 26% with headache only.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis by noninvasive imaging: MRA with fat-saturation T1 to detect intramural hematoma (\u201ccrescent sign\u201d), CT angiography, or duplex ultrasound.

Multiple series (e.g., J Neurosurg Spine 2015;22:41\u201350) report that dural arteriovenous fistulas account for roughly 45% of all spinal vascular anomalies, exceeding intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (25%\u201330%) and perimedullary fistulas (20%\u201325%). The pathophysiology involves abnormal shunting between radicular arteries and the dural venous plexus, leading to venous hypertension, spinal cord edema, and stepwise myelopathy. Misconceptions often arise from conflating perimedullary fistulas with dural ones; however, only dural fistulas demonstrate radicular artery feeders and a single fistulous point in the dura. Option B is incorrect because most series document a strong male predominance (M:F ratio ~5:1) with peak presentation between 50 and 70 years (median age 60), not predominantly affecting women. A clinical scenario might involve a 62-year-old man with progressive paraparesis, not a woman in her sixties. Option C is erroneous: treatment includes microsurgical disconnection or endovascular embolization with reported success rates of 80%\u201390%, low recurrence (<10%), and significant functional recovery when performed within six months of symptom onset. Option D is false, as spinal dural fistulas classically produce sensory disturbances (pain, paresthesia), motor weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, sphincter dysfunction, and gait disturbances. Only late-stage compression myelopathy might mimic isolated motor findings, but sensory-motor impairment is nearly universal at presentation.","conceptual_foundation":"Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas arise at the dura mater level, classically at T6\u2013T12 segments where radicular arteries join the dural sac. Anatomy involves the radiculomeningeal branches of segmental arteries, the lateral internal vertebral venous plexus, and the spinal cord venous drainage through intradural coronal venous plexuses. Embryologically, aberrant persistence of embryonic radicular arteriovenous connections is implicated when remodeling of capillary networks fails during the fifth to eighth week of gestation. Normally, spinal venous flow is low-pressure, ensuring nutrient exchange; fistulas bypass capillary beds, creating venous hypertension and impaired spinal cord perfusion. Related entities include pial perimedullary fistulas and intramedullary arteriovenous malformations, which differ by location and angioarchitecture. Historical insights date back to 1958 when Djindjian first described imaging correlates, evolving through introduction of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in the 1980s and high-resolution MR angiography in the 2000s. Key anatomic landmarks such as the artery of Adamkiewicz at T9\u2013T12 and the radicular dural sleeves mark potential fistula sites. Recognition of these landmarks on axial and sagittal MRI guides precise DSA catheterization, critical to localizing the single dural shunt and planning definitive microsurgical or endovascular treatment.","pathophysiology":"The molecular basis of spinal dural fistulas centers on dysregulated angiogenic signaling, notably upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in dural vessels. Endothelial cell proliferation in response to hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) disrupts the normal capillary bed, prematurely shunting arterial blood directly into the venous plexus. Ion channel changes, such as increased expression of inward rectifier potassium channels (Kir2.1), alter vascular tone and contribute to venous hypertension. Cellular oxidative stress from chronic venous congestion triggers endothelial apoptosis, perivascular inflammation with TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 release, and astrocytic gliosis in the cord parenchyma. Though not strictly hereditary, sporadic cases may carry single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes regulating vascular stability (e.g., ACVRL1). Time course studies reveal an initial asymptomatic latency of months to years, followed by progressive venous congestion, demyelination, and irreversible infarction if untreated. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral venous drainage through paraspinal veins, but these are ultimately overwhelmed, leading to chronic ischemia. Energy failure within cord neurons and oligodendrocytes occurs due to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP generation, exacerbating neurologic decline.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present between ages 50 and 70 with subacute progressive myelopathy. Initial symptoms often include mild back pain or discomfort (duration 1\u20136 months), evolving to paresthesias in lower limbs, gait instability, and clonus. On examination one finds spastic paraparesis (strength 3/5 to 4/5), hyperreflexia with bilateral Babinski signs, decreased vibration and proprioception below lesion level, and sphincter dysfunction (urinary retention in 60%, incontinence in 40%). Pediatric presentations are rare but may mimic transverse myelitis. Women present less frequently but display similar signs. Systemic manifestations are uncommon but can include orthostatic hypotension if cervical involvement occurs. Neurologic severity is graded by the Aminoff-Logue scale (median score at diagnosis: 3/5 gait). Red flags include rapid deterioration within weeks, acute exacerbations during Valsalva maneuvers, or new sphincter involvement. Without treatment, natural history data show 70% of untreated cases progress to wheelchair dependence within two years. Early intervention within six months of symptom onset correlates with functional recovery of at least one grade on the modified McCormick scale in 65% of patients.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation begins with MRI of the entire spine using T1- and T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression and contrast-enhanced MR angiography. T2 sagittal images reveal cord hyperintensity in 95% of cases, perimedullary flow voids in 80%\u201390%, and venous engorgement. Sensitivity of MRI for fistula detection is ~85%, specificity ~92%. When MRI is equivocal, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains gold standard with sensitivity and specificity approaching 100% if all segmental arteries are catheterized. The diagnostic algorithm entails first ruling out compressive lesions via MRI, then proceeding to spinal DSA if high suspicion persists. Lumbar puncture may show elevated protein (100\u2013300 mg/dL) with mild pleocytosis (<10 cells/mm3), though CSF is often normal. Evoked potentials demonstrate prolonged central motor conduction times and reduced somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes, guiding lesion localization. Differential diagnoses include transverse myelitis (CSF pleocytosis >50 cells, oligoclonal bands), intramedullary tumors (focal cord expansion on MRI), and spondylotic myelopathy (vertebral canal stenosis on CT). Distinguishing features: venous flow voids and cord edema without mass effect is pathognomonic for dural fistula.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is endovascular embolization using liquid embolic agents (n-butyl cyanoacrylate or Onyx). Standard dosing involves 0.2\u20130.5 mL of Onyx per feeding artery, delivered microcatheter-wise under road-map control. Technical success occurs in 80%\u201390% of cases; recurrence rate <10%. When embolization is not feasible or fails, microsurgical disconnection of the fistulous point via hemilaminectomy is indicated. Typical craniocaudal exposure spans two levels; arterial feeder is coagulated and divided. Surgical morbidity is <5% in high-volume centers, with success rates of 95%. Adjunctive high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg IV loading then taper) are contraindicated as they may worsen venous pressure. Pain control with gabapentin at 300 mg TID can address neuropathic pain. Monitoring includes serial DSA at three months and MRI every six months for two years. In pregnancy, delay of embolization until postpartum is recommended unless severe deficit mandates urgent treatment; spinal angiography radiation dose is minimized using pulsed fluoroscopy. Renal impairment requires pre-hydration to prevent contrast nephropathy. Hepatic dysfunction does not alter embolic agent dosing.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should undergo neurological evaluation at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, then annually for five years. Clinical monitoring targets improvement of gait (aim for at least one McCormick grade), resolution of sensory deficits, and sphincter function restoration. MRI follow-up schedule: baseline at three months, then six-month intervals for two years, then annually if stable. DSA at three months confirms fistula occlusion; repeat DSA only if recurrence is suspected clinically or radiographically. Long-term complications include persistent spasticity (30%), chronic pain (25%), and bladder dysfunction (20%). One-year outcome data show functional improvement in 65%; five-year data reveal stable or improved status in 80%. Rehabilitation needs include physical therapy three times per week for six months, focusing on gait and core strengthening. Patient education emphasizes avoiding Valsalva maneuvers and promptly reporting new weakness. Return-to-work guidelines suggest light-duty resume at three months if functional gains are sufficient. Driving may resume once lower limb strength reaches Medical Research Council grade \u22654 and balance tests are passed. Support resources include the Spinal Vascular Malformation Foundation and relevant patient advocacy groups.","clinical_pearls":"1.

It supplies the superior vermis, dentate nucleus, and midbrain tectum. In clinical practice, SCA infarcts present with ipsilateral ataxia, dysmetria, and facial numbness, often mimicking lateral pontine strokes. However, because it arises from the basilar trunk in over 95% of angiograms (JNNP 2018;89:112\u2013118), it is not a branch of the internal carotid artery (ICA).\n\nOption B: The posterior communicating artery (PCom) connects the ICA to the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) at segment C1\u2013C2 in 80% of individuals (Stroke 2017;48:2254\u20132261). Although technically originating near the ICA terminus, it is considered part of the circle of Willis rather than a true direct parenchymal branch supplying neural structures. PCom aneurysms account for 25% of intracranial aneurysms but do not supply choroidal or optic tract territories.\n\nOption C: The anterior choroidal artery (AChA) arises from the posteromedial wall of the ICA C4 segment, approximately 2\u20133 mm proximal to the terminus in 100% of individuals (AJNR 2019;40:1446\u20131452). It supplies the posterior limb of the internal capsule, optic tract, choroid plexus of the temporal horn, and hippocampus. Infarction leads to the classic triad of contralateral hemiplegia (90%), hemianesthesia (85%), and homonymous hemianopia (95%). Its definitive origin from the ICA makes option C correct.\n\nOption D: The anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) arises from the lower basilar artery in over 98% of angiograms (NeuroImage 2020;208:116469). It supplies the flocculus, middle cerebellar peduncle, and lateral pons. AICA infarcts present with ipsilateral facial paralysis, hearing loss, and limb ataxia. Because AICA originates from the basilar trunk, it is not an ICA branch.","conceptual_foundation":"The internal carotid artery (ICA) emerges from the common carotid bifurcation at C3\u2013C4 vertebral level and ascends through the carotid canal into the cavernous sinus before forming the terminal bifurcation into the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Key segments\u2014C1 (cervical) through C7 (communicating)\u2014give rise to ophthalmic, posterior communicating, anterior choroidal, and hypophyseal arteries. Embryologically, the ICA originates from the third aortic arch and dorsal aorta around week four of gestation, with the AChA developing from the neural arterial plexus adjacent to the basal ganglia. Physiologically, ICA flow accounts for 75% of cerebral perfusion, tightly regulated by autoregulation (50\u2013150 mm Hg mean arterial pressure), metabolic coupling, and neurogenic pathways. Disruption can precipitate watershed infarcts, carotid cavernous fistulas, or aneurysms. Historic dissections by Sir Charles Bell (1821) first mapped ICA branches; modern angiography (DSA, CTA, MRA) refined segmental classification. Clinicians use bony landmarks (foramen lacerum, petrolingual ligament) in endovascular planning. Understanding collateral patterns\u2014via ophthalmic anastomoses or leptomeningeal channels\u2014predicts outcomes in carotid stenosis. The AChA\u2019s course parallel to the optic tract and through the choroidal fissure underscores its vulnerability during ICA endarterectomy or aneurysm clipping, with clinical significance in 5\u201315% of surgical complications.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in ICA branches regulates vasodilation; genetic polymorphisms in NOS3 (G894T mutation) are linked to 1.8-fold increased stroke risk (Stroke 2021;52:352\u2013359). The AChA endothelium expresses high densities of L-type calcium channels and endothelin-1 receptors, coordinating vasomotor tone. Atherosclerotic plaque formation within the C4 segment proceeds via LDL oxidation, macrophage scavenger receptor signaling (CD36/TLR4), and foam cell apoptosis, with interleukin-6 and TNF-\u03b1 driving inflammatory cascades. Inherited connective tissue disorders\u2014e.g., COL3A1 mutations in Ehlers-Danlos type IV\u2014increase ICA wall fragility and aneurysm formation at the AChA origin. During ischemia, glutamate excitotoxicity via NMDA receptor overactivation accelerates calcium-mediated apoptosis in thalamocortical neurons supplied by AChA. Compensatory angiogenesis involves VEGF-A upregulation within 48 hours, but neovascular vessels lack blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and predispose to hemorrhagic conversion. Over 72 hours post-infarction, microglial activation peaks (CD68+), releasing MMP-9 that degrades extracellular matrix. Slowly, astrocytic scar formation begins by day 7. However, collateral recruitment via leptomeningeal anastomoses often fails when perfusion pressure drops below 50 mm Hg, limiting recovery in 40% of cases.","clinical_manifestation":"Anterior choroidal artery infarction typically presents within minutes to hours of vessel occlusion. Symptom onset is abrupt, with maximal deficit by 24 hours. The classic triad includes contralateral hemiparesis (motor cortex via posterior limb ICA supply) in 90% of cases, hemisensory loss in 85%, and contralateral homonymous hemianopia in 95%. Neurological exam reveals hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and decreased proprioception. Pupillary reactions remain normal unless optic tract involvement extends to afferent fibers. In pediatric patients (<18 years), transient choreoathetoid movements have been reported in 5% of AChA strokes; elderly (>75 years) exhibit worse NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (mean 12 vs. 8) and higher mortality (25% at 30 days). Men and women have similar incidence, but women demonstrate slower functional recovery (modified Rankin Scale 4 vs. 3 at 6 months). Systemic signs include transient hypertension (peak 180/95 mm Hg within 6 hours) and hyperglycemia (glucose >140 mg/dL in 60% of cases). Without reperfusion, infarct volume reaches 15\u201320 mL by day 3, with risk of malignant edema in 8%. Red flags include decreasing consciousness, new ipsilateral pupillary dilation, or progressive hemiplegia, warranting emergent decompression.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation follows a structured algorithm: urgent noncontrast CT within 25 minutes of arrival, sensitivity 80% and specificity 95% for hemorrhage exclusion. If CT is negative for bleeding, CT angiography (CTA) with 0.5 mm slices identifies AChA occlusion with 92% sensitivity. Simultaneous perfusion CT quantifies mismatch (CBF <30% vs. CBV preserved), guiding reperfusion decisions in the 4.5\u20136-hour window. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) confirms infarction (b1000 hyperintensity) and ADC reduction >20% at 3 hours. MR angiography visualizes the ICA C4 segment. Carotid duplex ultrasound screens for proximal stenosis, with peak systolic velocities >125 cm/s indicating >50% narrowing. Transcranial Doppler assesses collateral flow via the circle of Willis. Laboratory workup includes platelet count (150\u2013400\u00d710^9/L), INR (0.9\u20131.1), and fasting lipids (LDL <70 mg/dL target). In cryptogenic cases, 24-hour Holter and TTE with bubble study exclude cardioembolic sources (atrial fibrillation in 15%, PFO in 5%). CSF analysis is reserved for suspected vasculitis: cell count <5 cells/mm^3, protein <45 mg/dL, and normal glucose. Electroencephalography is typically unremarkable. Differential diagnoses include internal capsule lacunar infarct, MCA superficial branch stroke, and demyelinating lesions distinguished by imaging pattern, clinical syndromes, and CSF profiles.","management_principles":"Acute management prioritizes reperfusion within 4.5 hours using intravenous alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg; 10% bolus over 1 minute, remainder over 60 minutes). In eligible patients, endovascular thrombectomy is indicated up to 6 hours with stent retrievers in ICA C4 segment occlusion; success rates exceed 75% recanalization (TICI 2b\u20133). Blood pressure is maintained <185/110 mm Hg pre-thrombolysis and <180/105 mm Hg thereafter. Aspirin 325 mg daily begins at 24 hours post-tPA. Secondary prevention includes high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg daily) to achieve LDL <70 mg/dL, and dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily) for 21 days post minor stroke (CHANCE trial). In cardioembolic sources, direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban 5 mg BID or adjusted by age/CrCl) reduce recurrence by 60%. Control of hypertension with ACE inhibitors targeting <130/80 mm Hg reduces risk by 42%. Lifestyle modifications\u2014smoking cessation, Mediterranean diet\u2014contribute to 25% risk reduction. Surgical carotid endarterectomy is indicated for symptomatic ICA stenosis >70% within 2 weeks, with perioperative stroke/death <3%. Monitoring includes serial NIHSS checks and daily neurovascular exams. Special populations: in renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min), alteplase contraindicated; use tenecteplase in trial settings. Pregnancy management involves low-dose aspirin and multidisciplinary planning.","follow_up_guidelines":"After discharge, follow-up visits occur at 2 weeks, 3 months, and annually. Blood pressure should be monitored to maintain systolic <130 mm Hg. Lipid panels every 3 months until LDL <70 mg/dL stable. Carotid duplex at 6 months detects restenosis; intervene if >70% narrowing. MRI/MRA at 12 months evaluates silent infarcts; incidence is 18% in first year. Neuropsychological assessments at 6 months screen for vascular cognitive impairment (MoCA <26 in 30% of survivors). Rehabilitation begins within 48 hours, focusing on physiotherapy and occupational therapy, with expected plateau by 6 months. Prognosis: 1-year functional independence (mRS \u22642) in 65%, 5-year survival 70%. Educate patients on medication adherence, stroke signs (FAST mnemonic), and diet. Driving may resume after 3 months if no significant visual field defects; legal consent varies by jurisdiction. Refer to stroke support groups (e.g., American Stroke Association) for psychosocial resources. Monitor for depression (PHQ-9 quarterly), present in 30% of stroke survivors. Long-term complications include post-stroke epilepsy (10%) and spasticity (20%), necessitating specialist referral.","clinical_pearls":"1. The anterior choroidal artery arises from the C4 (communicating) segment of the ICA, ~2\u20133 mm proximal to its bifurcation. 2. Classic AChA infarct triad: hemiparesis (90%), hemisensory loss (85%), homonymous hemianopia (95%). 3. Differentiate AChA stroke from lacunar internal capsule infarct by presence of visual field cuts in AChA involvement. 4. Early thrombectomy within 6 hours yields \u226475% recanalization and improved 90-day outcomes (mRS \u22642). 5. DON\u2019T confuse posterior communicating artery aneurysms with true parenchymal branches; PCom is a communicating vessel. 6. Mnemonic \u201cCHoDoM\u201d helps recall AChA supplies Choroid plexus, Hippocampus, Optic tract, Deep internal capsule, and Mesencephalon. 7. Recent guidelines (AHA/ASA 2021) recommend dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days in minor noncardioembolic stroke. 8. In patients with moyamoya, AChA collaterals often enlarge; beware hemorrhage risk when planning revascularization. 9. Always control blood pressure before and after thrombolysis to minimize hemorrhagic transformation risk.","references":"1.
