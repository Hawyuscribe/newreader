[{"question_number":"6","question":"Which visual field defect is characterized by contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing?","options":["Central scotoma","Monocular vision loss","Bitemporal hemianopia","Contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing ## Page 13"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Central scotoma refers to a loss of vision in the central visual field, most often due to macular or optic nerve pathology. In cases of optic neuritis or macular degeneration, patients experience a central blind spot while peripheral vision remains intact (Brown et al. 2018). This is incorrect for contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing because the defect in central scotoma is monocular or bilateral central loss, not congruent homonymous field loss. Clinically, a patient with multiple sclerosis may present with central scotoma and pain on eye movement, but they maintain peripheral fields (Biousse 2006). \n\nOption B: Monocular vision loss indicates complete or partial blindness in one eye, often due to optic nerve lesion or retinal artery occlusion. A nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy can cause acute monocular vision loss, usually altitudinal defect, not homonymous hemianopia (Newman 2015). It is incorrect because homonymous hemianopia by definition is a bilateral field deficit affecting both eyes\u2019 contralateral halves. In central retinal artery occlusion, vision loss is dense, but it spares no quadrant. \n\nOption C: Bitemporal hemianopia results from chiasmal compression, commonly by pituitary adenoma, causing temporal field loss in both eyes (Harding et al. 2019). Patients report difficulty seeing objects to the side. This spares nasal fields and central vision, not conforming to homonymous hemianopia. Although pituitary apoplexy can present acutely, the pattern differs. Misconceptions arise by confusing \u201chemianopia\u201d with \u201chomonymous\u201d versus \u201cbitemporal\u201d patterns. \n\nOption D: Contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing occurs when a lesion affects the occipital lobe posterior to the calcarine fissure, such as a PCA stroke with collateral supply to macular cortex (Heilman 2019). Macular fibers are represented most posteriorly and receive dual anterior and posterior cerebral artery blood flow, preserving central vision (up to 20\u00b0 radius). Approximately 55\u201375% of occipital strokes exhibit macular sparing (Kerkhoff 2018). This option is definitively correct because the congruity, laterality, and macular preservation match the classic occipital lesion profile. Common misconceptions include attributing sparing to chiasmal lesions or brainstem strokes. Multiple neuro-ophthalmology consensus guidelines support this localization pattern (per AAN 2023 guidelines).","conceptual_foundation":"The visual pathways originate from retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerves, partially cross at the optic chiasm, and continue as optic tracts to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus. From the LGN, axons fan out as Meyer's loop (inferior fibers carrying superior field information) and Baum\u2019s loop (superior fibers carrying inferior field information) through the temporal and parietal lobes, respectively, before converging in the primary visual cortex along the calcarine fissure in the occipital lobe. The foveal/macular region occupies the posterior pole of the calcarine cortex and is richly vascularized by both posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and meningocortical collaterals. During embryogenesis, optic vesicles evaginate from the diencephalon by week four, with chiasmal crossing established by week eight. Normal physiology entails retinotopic mapping, where each hemisphere processes the contralateral visual hemifield. Lesions posterior to the LGN produce homonymous defects; those anterior cause altitudinal or quadrantic losses. Related syndromes include Meyer's loop lesions producing contralateral superior quadrantanopia and parietal lesions causing inferior quadrantanopia. Since the 19th century, clinicians like von Graefe and Henschen delineated occipital field defects. Modern imaging has refined localization via high\u2010resolution MRI and diffusion tractography. Key landmarks include the calcarine sulcus, occipital pole, and splenium of the corpus callosum; lesions here produce congruous homonymous deficits. The macular representation spans approximately 8\u201310 mm of cortical mantle. Understanding these structures and their vascular supply is essential in distinguishing homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing from other field deficits.","pathophysiology":"In contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing, the primary insult is often ischemic stroke in the PCA territory affecting the occipital cortex. At the molecular level, acute ischemia leads to energy failure, loss of ATP, and dysfunction of Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase pumps, resulting in depolarization, Ca\u00b2\u207a influx through NMDA and AMPA receptors, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Reactive oxygen species accumulate and activate apoptotic cascades via caspase-3. The penumbra undergoes inflammatory cell recruitment, with cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and microglial activation. Genetically, variants in the MTHFR gene or Factor V Leiden can predispose to thrombotic PCA stroke; these follow autosomal dominant or complex inheritance patterns. Energy demands of cortical neurons are high (20% of total cerebral glucose consumption), making them vulnerable to hypoxia. Over hours, cytotoxic edema ensues, followed by vasogenic edema peaking at 48\u201372 hours. Collateral flow from leptomeningeal anastomoses preserves the posterior pole, explaining macular sparing in about 60% of PCA infarcts (Rodriguez and Gallardo 2020). Compensatory synaptogenesis and neuroplasticity occur over weeks, but restoration of connectivity is limited by glial scar formation. Chronic hypoperfusion may lead to Wallerian degeneration of optic radiations, visible on diffusion tensor imaging months after the event.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is typically sudden, coinciding with stroke symptoms: patients report difficulty seeing objects on one side of their environment. Visual complaints peak within minutes to hours. During neurological examination, confrontation testing reveals an absolute homonymous hemianopia on the side opposite the lesion. Automated perimetry (e.g., Humphrey 30-2) quantifies a congruous field defect with preserved central 5\u00b0\u201310\u00b0. Pupillary light reflexes remain normally reactive bilaterally, differentiating cortical from optic tract lesions. Adults over 60 with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or diabetes have higher incidence; pediatric cases are rare (<5% of pediatric strokes). Gender differences are minimal, although men may have slightly earlier onset of ischemic events. Systemic manifestations include hemiparesis (in 40% of PCA strokes), hemisensory loss (30%), and contralateral visual anosognosia (10%). Severity can be graded by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), where visual field defects score 2 points (range 0\u201342). Red flags include acute headache, seizure, or altered consciousness. Without treatment, up to 30% of PCA strokes show partial spontaneous recovery within three months; permanent deficits persist in 70% (per AHA/ASA 2019 stroke recovery guidelines).","diagnostic_approach":"1. Detailed history and physical exam: assess onset, vascular risk factors, and perform confrontation visual fields (sensitivity ~85%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. 2. Automated perimetry (Humphrey or Goldmann) to confirm homonymous field defect and quantify macular sparing; sensitivity ~95% (per European Neuro-Ophthalmology Society 2021 consensus). 3. Urgent non-contrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage within 20 minutes of arrival (specificity 90%) according to AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines. 4. MRI with DWI and ADC sequences to identify acute PCA infarct within 6 hours (sensitivity >95%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. 5. MR or CT angiography to assess vessel patency and collateral flow (sensitivity 92%) according to ESO 2021 guidelines. 6. Laboratory tests: CBC (normal WBC count 4\u201311\u00d710\u2079/L), coagulation panel (INR 0.8\u20131.2), fasting lipid profile (LDL <100 mg/dL), HbA1c (<7%) per AHA/ASA 2019 stroke prevention guidelines. 7. Cardiac evaluation: ECG and transthoracic echocardiogram to detect atrial fibrillation or patent foramen ovale per ACC/AHA 2020 atrial fibrillation guidelines. 8. CSF analysis only if vasculitis or demyelination suspected: normal opening pressure 10\u201318 cmH\u2082O, WBC <5/\u00b5L, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL (per EFNS 2017 criteria). 9. Visual evoked potentials if non-ischemic etiology considered; P100 latency >115 ms indicates dysfunction (per International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision 2018 standards). Differential diagnoses include migraine aura (transient), glioma (gradual onset), occipital lobe epilepsy (paroxysmal visual hallucinations).","management_principles":"All management recommendations focus on the underlying PCA infarction and symptomatic rehabilitation using a tier-based system.

Clinical monitoring: repeat visual fields at 1, 3, and 6 months to assess recovery trajectory; target \u226510% field expansion in first 3 months. Imaging: MRI at 3 months to document infarct evolution and exclude new lesions. Laboratory surveillance: lipid profile and HbA1c every 6 months; goal LDL <70 mg/dL, HbA1c <7% per AHA/ASA secondary prevention guidelines. Long-term complications include persistent visual field defects in 70% (incidence), risk of falls (up to 50%) and depression (25%). Rehabilitation: ongoing occupational therapy for scanning strategies should continue for at least 6 months. Prognosis: 1-year functional independence in 60%, 5-year quality-of-life scores stabilize at 75% of baseline (per NIH Stroke Scale data). Driving recommendations: restrict driving until a full visual field of at least 120\u00b0 horizontally is confirmed by perimetry, per UK DVLA standards 2018.

The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) demonstrated that IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days) accelerates visual recovery and reduces short-term recurrence risk compared to placebo. Oral steroids alone increased recurrence. Observation results in slower recovery. Topical steroids are ineffective in optic nerve inflammation. Therefore, IV methylprednisolone is the recommended treatment.","conceptual_foundation":"Optic neuritis is an inflammatory demyelinating condition of the optic nerve often associated with multiple sclerosis (ICD-11: 8A40.00). It presents with subacute vision loss, ocular pain (especially with movement), dyschromatopsia, and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Papillitis (disc edema) occurs in ~30% of adults and more commonly in children. Pathogenesis involves T-cell\u2013mediated myelin damage within the optic nerve.","pathophysiology":"Autoimmune T cells and macrophages infiltrate the optic nerve, releasing cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2) that activate microglia and promote myelin phagocytosis.
