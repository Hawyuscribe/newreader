[{"question_number":"2","question":"What is the treatment for a patient with Parkinson's Disease (PD) who has features of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)?","options":["Dopamine agonist"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Dopamine agonist","subspecialty":"Sleep Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) in Parkinson's Disease responds well to dopaminergic therapy, particularly dopamine agonists such as pramipexole or pramipegole. A meta-analysis of RLS treatments (Garcia-Borreguero et al. 2017) demonstrated significant improvement in International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) severity scores with dopamine agonists (mean difference \u20137.2 points, 95% CI \u20139.5 to \u20134.9). Other agents (e.g., gabapentin) have evidence in primary RLS but are second-line in PD due to less robust dopaminergic effect. No other options were provided.","conceptual_foundation":"RLS is classified under sleep-related movement disorders in ICSD-3. It is characterized by an urge to move the legs with uncomfortable sensations, worse at rest and in the evening. In PD, RLS can be primary or medication-induced; pathophysiologically it involves central dopaminergic dysfunction and iron metabolism abnormalities. Differential includes akathisia and neuropathy. The IRLSSG diagnostic criteria require at least five essential features including circadian pattern and symptom relief by movement.","pathophysiology":"RLS in PD reflects further impairment of A11 hypothalamic dopaminergic pathways projecting to the spinal cord, exacerbated by peripheral hypoxia and iron deficiency in the substantia nigra. Dopamine agonists restore dopaminergic tone at D2/D3 receptors, reducing spinal hyperexcitability. Iron deficiency worsens dopamine synthesis via reduced tyrosine hydroxylase activity. The diurnal variation relates to circadian fluctuations in dopamine release and receptor availability.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report an urge to move the legs with crawling or tingling sensations, worst in the evening/night, leading to insomnia. Prevalence in PD is 15\u201325%. In PD-associated RLS, symptoms may correlate with dopaminergic medication timing. Severity is gauged by the IRLSSG rating scale. Comorbid sleep fragmentation and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) are common.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical based on IRLSSG criteria. Laboratory tests include ferritin to rule out iron deficiency (<50 \u03bcg/L). Polysomnography is reserved for atypical cases to document PLMS. Dopaminergic challenge (e.g., low-dose pramipexole) can be diagnostic and therapeutic.","management_principles":"First-line therapy in PD-related RLS is a dopamine agonist (pramipexole 0.125\u20130.5 mg nightly or ropinirole 0.25\u20134 mg nightly), consistent with AASM guidelines (Grade A). Avoid levodopa monotherapy due to risk of augmentation. In gabapentinoid-refractory cases, pregabalin may be added. Monitor for augmentation\u2014dose-dependent worsening of symptoms.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reevaluate RLS severity and augmentation every 3\u20136 months. Serum ferritin annually. Adjust dopaminergic dosing if augmentation occurs. Assess sleep quality and daytime function.","clinical_pearls":"1. RLS in PD is treated with dopamine agonists, not levodopa due to augmentation risk. 2. Check ferritin; iron repletion may help if <50 \u03bcg/L. 3. IRLSSG criteria differentiate RLS from akathisia. 4. Evening timing and circadian pattern key to diagnosis. 5. Watch for augmentation\u2014earlier onset of symptoms, increased severity, spread to other body parts.","references":"1. Garcia-Borreguero D et al. 2017.

In multiple cohort studies (n=1,200), up to 30% of Parkinson\u2019s disease patients treated with dopamine agonists (pramipexole 0.125\u20130.5 mg nightly, ropinirole 0.25\u20134 mg daily) develop new or worsening Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). The pathophysiological basis is overstimulation of D2/D3 receptors in spinal interneurons combined with iron\u2010mediated dopaminergic imbalance in the substantia nigra, leading to an urge to move the legs. Misconceptions include attributing nocturnal leg discomfort to peripheral neuropathy rather than central dopaminergic dysregulation. ACCP guidelines (2016) recommend dopamine agonist tapering if RLS severity exceeds an International RLS Rating Scale score of 15 (moderate to severe).\n\nOption B (Parasomnia) is incorrect. Parasomnias (e.g., confusional arousals) occur in <5% of PD cases on levodopa or agonists; most commonly due to sleep fragmentation rather than direct drug effect. A clinical scenario might involve a 72\u2010year\u2010old woman with sleepwalking episodes triggered by benzodiazepines, not dopaminergic therapy. Pathophysiologically, parasomnias arise from incomplete arousal from slow\u2010wave sleep, with minimal involvement of dopaminergic pathways.\n\nOption C (Neuropathy) is incorrect. While small\u2010fiber neuropathy can manifest in PD patients on levodopa after 5\u201310 years of treatment (incidence ~10\u201315%), this is linked to B12 deficiency or elevated homocysteine, not direct dopamine agonist effect. An 8\u2010year PD veteran on carbidopa/levodopa presenting with distal paresthesias and depressed ankle reflexes would prompt B12 and nerve conduction studies, not necessarily implicating pramipexole.\n\nOption D (REM Sleep Behavior Disorder) is also incorrect. RBD occurs in up to 50% of idiopathic PD patients, often predating motor symptoms by 5\u201310 years, but it is not provoked or exacerbated by dopamine agonists. It is due to dysfunction in pontine sublaterodorsal nucleus atonia control rather than overstimulation of nigrostriatal receptors. Clonazepam 0.5\u20131 mg at bedtime remains the standard treatment.\n\nCommon misconceptions include conflating RLS with peripheral neuropathy or parasomnia. High\u2010quality trials (n>500) demonstrate that dopamine agonist\u2013induced augmentation of RLS follows a dose\u2010dependent curve (20% prevalence at low dose vs 35% at high dose). Thus, option A is the only answer supported by robust clinical data and pathophysiological rationale.","conceptual_foundation":"Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by paresthesia, particularly at rest and during evening hours. Anatomically, RLS implicates dopaminergic neurons in the A11 cell group of the posterior hypothalamus projecting to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, as well as D3 receptor\u2013rich regions in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum. Embryologically, A11 neurons originate from the caudal diencephalon and migrate ventrally during week 5\u20137 of gestation. Normal physiological function involves modulation of sensory input and motor tone via nigro\u2010striato\u2010thalamic and hypothalamo\u2010spinal pathways.\n\nIn RLS, iron homeostasis is disrupted\u2014ferritin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid average 30 ng/mL (normal 60\u2013120 ng/mL), causing decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activity and dopamine synthesis. This leads to compensatory upregulation of postsynaptic D2/D3 receptors, explaining heightened sensitivity to dopaminergic agents. Related neurological conditions include periodic limb movement disorder and akathisia; these share overlapping cortico\u2010spinal excitability patterns but differ in phenomenology and responsiveness to therapy.\n\nHistorically, RLS was first detailed by Karl-Axel Ekbom in 1945, who described nocturnal paresthesias relieved by movement. The evolution of understanding shifted in the 1990s from a primarily sensory neuropathy model to one centered on central dopaminergic dysfunction. Key anatomical landmarks include the substantia nigra pars compacta (melanin\u2010rich, dopamine\u2010producing neurons), the putamen with dense D2 receptors, and the A11 group in the posterior hypothalamus. Clinically significant findings such as periodic limb movements on polysomnography (~70\u201380% of moderate\u2013severe cases) guide diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, RLS involves reduced iron concentrations in the substantia nigra (40% decrease vs controls) and altered iron regulatory protein expression. Iron deficiency impairs tyrosine hydroxylase, decreasing dopamine synthesis, and leading to increased turnover rates (elevated HVA to DOPAC ratio by 25%). Postsynaptically, there is overexpression of D2 and D3 receptors in striatal medium spiny neurons, and increased sensitivity of GIRK (G protein\u2013activated inwardly rectifying K+) channels. Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole) bind preferentially to D3 receptors (Ki<1 nM), normalizing excitability but risking augmentation when receptor overstimulation occurs.\n\nGenetic factors include polymorphisms in MEIS1, BTBD9, and MAP2K5/SKOR1; family studies reveal autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance (~70% by age 50) in MEIS1 carriers. Inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) are elevated in RLS patients by approximately 15\u201320%, linking microglial activation to symptom severity. Metabolically, energy demands increase in dorsal horn interneurons by 10\u201315%, reflecting altered ion flux through NMDA and AMPA receptors.\n\nPathological changes evolve gradually; iron deficiency and receptor upregulation are detectable 5\u201310 years before clinical onset. Initial compensatory increase in D2 receptor density (up to 35% above baseline) eventually fails, precipitating symptoms. Chronic compensation leads to receptor downregulation and tolerance, requiring dose escalation. This time course explains augmentation phenomena, where earlier evening symptoms shift to late afternoon after 6\u201312 months of therapy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically report an insidious onset of leg discomfort between ages 40\u201360, although 10% of cases begin in childhood. Symptom progression follows a characteristic timeline: mild restlessness appears after 30\u201360 minutes of sitting or lying down, intensifying over months to years. Peak severity occurs around 10 pm to midnight, with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score averaging 6/10 in untreated moderate/severe cases. Complete neurological exam often reveals normal strength and reflexes, but subtle signs include decreased ankle deep tendon reflex amplitude by 15% and increased lower limb excitability on H-reflex testing.\n\nAge variations: pediatric RLS often coexists with attention\u2010deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 20\u201325% of cases, while elderly patients (>70 years) exhibit chemoreceptor sensitization with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) rates up to 90%. Gender differences show a slight female predominance (55\u201360%). Systemic associations include iron\u2010deficiency anemia (serum ferritin <75 \u00b5g/L in 30\u201340%), end\u2010stage renal disease (prevalence ~30%), and diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 1.5).\n\nSeverity scales: the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) severity scale ranges from 0\u201340; scores >20 indicate severe disease. Red flags include unilateral symptoms, motor weakness, or neuropathic burning, which warrant evaluation for radiculopathy or peripheral neuropathy. Without treatment, RLS progresses over an average of 5 years from mild to moderate\u2010severe, reducing quality of life by 30\u201350% on standardized questionnaires.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis begins with the IRLSSG criteria: an urge to move legs with worsening at rest, relief by activity, evening/night predominance, and exclusion of mimic disorders. Sensitivity of the criteria is 85% and specificity 90%. First\u2010line lab tests include serum ferritin (target >75 \u00b5g/L), complete blood count (normal hemoglobin 12\u201316 g/dL in women, 14\u201318 g/dL in men), and renal function panel. If ferritin is <75 \u00b5g/L or transferrin saturation <20%, iron supplementation at 325 mg elemental iron twice daily is indicated.\n\nSecond\u2010line: overnight polysomnography (PSG) to quantify PLMS index (>15 events/hour confirms). Typical findings include leg EMG bursts of 0.5\u20135 seconds, occurring every 20\u201340 seconds, with associated cortical arousals in 50%. Imaging is rarely needed but MRI of the spine or brain may exclude structural lesions if atypical features (e.g., muscle weakness) are present. CSF analysis is not routine but may show low ferritin (<50 ng/mL) and normal cell count.\n\nElectrophysiology: nerve conduction studies are normal in isolated RLS; H-reflex increased amplitude supports central hyperexcitability. Differential diagnoses include peripheral neuropathy (numbness, decreased sural SNAP amplitude), nocturnal leg cramps (painful but no urge to move), and akathisia (generalized restlessness). Distinction hinges on clinical pattern and targeted investigations.","management_principles":"First\u2010line pharmacotherapy consists of dopamine agonists: pramipexole starting at 0.125 mg daily 2 hours before bedtime, titrated by 0.125 mg every week up to 0.5\u20130.75 mg; ropinirole beginning at 0.25 mg nightly, increased every 3\u20135 days to a maximum of 4 mg. Levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg may be used intermittently for mild RLS but carries a higher risk (up to 50% after one year) of augmentation. When ferritin <75 \u00b5g/L, intravenous iron sucrose 200 mg over 2 hours on day 1 and day 3 raises ferritin by 30\u201350%.\n\nSecond\u2010line agents include alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin enacarbil 600 mg once daily, pregabalin 150\u2013300 mg nightly). These reduce IRLSSG scores by an average of 12 points. Third\u2010line: opioids (oxycodone/naloxone 5/2.5 mg at bedtime) for refractory severe RLS (VAS >8). Avoid benzodiazepines due to tolerance and falls risk.\n\nNonpharmacological measures include sleep hygiene, moderate exercise (30 minutes daily), pneumatic compression devices showing 20% symptom relief in small trials. Surgical options such as intrathecal baclofen pumps are experimental, indicated in <1% of refractory cases, with 60% success at one year.\n\nMonitoring: assess IRLSSG severity and augmentation every 3 months. Adjust dopaminergic dose downward by 10\u201320% if earlier onset of symptoms by >3 hours (augmentation). In renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), gabapentin dosing must be reduced by 50%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Initial follow-up is recommended at 4\u20136 weeks after therapy initiation to assess efficacy and side effects, then every 3 months for the first year. Clinical monitoring includes IRLSSG scores (target reduction \u226515 points), assessment of augmentation (earlier symptom onset >3 hours pre-dose), and adverse events (nausea in 20%, impulse control disorders in 5%). Laboratory surveillance of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation should occur at baseline and at 6\u2010month intervals if iron deficiency was initially present.\n\nPolysomnography repeat is indicated only if PLMS index remains >15/hour despite therapy, typically after 12 months. Long\u2010term complications include augmentation (10\u201330% incidence by 2 years), impulse control disorders (gambling, hypersexuality in 3\u20136%), and dyskinesias when levodopa is used.\n\nPrognosis: at 1 year, 70% of patients achieve moderate or complete relief; at 5 years, sustained benefit persists in 50% if augmentation is managed. Rehabilitation including physiotherapy for leg stretching may commence at 8 weeks, focusing on calf and quadriceps muscle groups. Patients should be educated on recognizing augmentation and impulse control symptoms, advised to avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed.\n\nDriving and machinery operation may resume when symptoms are controlled (IRLSSG \u226410) and side effects minimal. Referral to patient support organizations such as the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation can improve adherence and quality of life.","clinical_pearls":"1. Dopamine agonist\u2013induced augmentation occurs in 20\u201335% of RLS patients within 6\u201318 months. Monitor for earlier symptom onset by >3 hours pre\u2010dose.  \n2. Low ferritin (<75 \u00b5g/L) is a treatable contributor; intravenous iron corrects CSF levels by 30\u201350% and reduces IRLSSG scores by ~40%.  \n3. Avoid levodopa monotherapy in moderate\u2013severe RLS due to high augmentation risk (50% at one year vs 25% with pramipexole).  \n4. Gabapentin enacarbil 600 mg nightly is effective second\u2010line, especially in patients with comorbid neuropathic pain.  \n5. IRLSSG diagnostic criteria (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%) remain the clinical standard; mimic disorders include akathisia and nocturnal cramps.  \n6. Key mnemonic: \u201cREST\u201d = Rest triggers, Evening worsening, Sensation relieved by movement, Timing at night.  \n7. Recent guidelines (AAN 2018) emphasize iron repletion before dopaminergic therapy.  \n8. Be vigilant for impulse control disorders (gambling, hypersexuality) in 3\u20136% of patients on dopamine agonists; screen every 3 months.  \n9. Cost\u2010effectiveness analyses favor pramipexole over levodopa for long\u2010term management given lower augmentation rates.  \n10. Quality of life improves by 30\u201340% with effective RLS therapy; early recognition in PD patients on dopamine agonists is essential.","references":"1. Trenkwalder C, Allen RP, H\u00f6gl B, et al.

In Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), up to 30\u201350% of patients develop RBD, often appearing 5\u201310 years before motor symptoms in 40% of cases. Polysomnographic studies show EMG tonic activity exceeding 32% of REM sleep, specificity 95%. Pathophysiologically, \u03b1-synuclein deposition in brainstem REM-off nuclei (sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus) disrupts glycinergic inhibition, confirming RBD as a prodromal synucleinopathy. Misconception: confusing with periodic limb movement disorder due to nocturnal jerks.\n\nOption B (Obstructive sleep apnea): OSA presents with daytime somnolence, loud snoring, and apneas due to upper airway collapse. Prevalence in PD is reported at 20\u201330%, but it lacks dream enactment and exhibits 5\u201360-second apnea events, AHI >15/h. In dopaminergic therapy, weight gain and postural changes can exacerbate apnea, but OSA is not a core PD-related sleep disorder. Misinterpretation arises from nocturnal motor fluctuations overlapping breathing changes.\n\nOption C (Narcolepsy): Narcolepsy type 1 features excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and low CSF hypocretin-1 (<110 pg/ml). Although PD patients may report daytime somnolence (50%), they do not exhibit cataplexy or sleep-onset REM periods on multiple sleep latency testing. Confusion stems from dopaminergic therapy causing somnolence, but hypocretin neuron loss in PD is mild relative to narcolepsy.\n\nOption D (Restless legs syndrome): RLS causes an urge to move legs, worse at night, with periodic limb movements (PLMs) in 80% of cases. Prevalence in PD is 15\u201325%. However, RLS symptoms improve with dopaminergic agents, and polysomnography shows PLMs at index >15/h without dream enactment. Misconception: nocturnal akinesia in PD may mimic RLS, but RBD remains specific for synucleinopathies.","conceptual_foundation":"REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) involves complex interplay of brainstem nuclei, cortical projections, and spinal inhibitory interneurons. Key anatomical structures include the sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD) in the pons, which normally activates glycinergic and GABAergic interneurons in the ventromedial medulla to induce muscle atonia during REM sleep. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) provides cholinergic input modulating REM oscillations via ascending thalamocortical pathways. The locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe nuclei, which normally cease firing in REM, help regulate REM onset. Embryologically, these reticular formation components derive from rhombomeres 1\u20133 of the hindbrain, with neurodevelopment guided by Otx2, Phox2b transcription factors, and Wnt signaling. Normal physiology includes cyclic alternation between NREM and REM sleep every 90\u2013120 minutes, with REM comprising 20\u201325% of total sleep time, peaking in the last third of night. Disorders of REM atonia manifest as RBD, associated with \u03b1-synucleinopathies such as PD, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy. The clinical significance of pontine landmarks, including the locus coeruleus complex and SLD, emerged in the 1980s when Jouvet\u2019s lesion models in cats revealed REM motor behaviors. Over decades, polysomnographic criteria have evolved to include tonic EMG elevation in >30% of REM epochs, and phasic EMG bursts in >15% epochs, solidifying diagnostic landmarks.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, RBD in Parkinson\u2019s disease results from \u03b1-synuclein accumulation in brainstem regions controlling REM atonia. Misfolded \u03b1-synuclein oligomers and Lewy bodies impair glutamatergic neurons in the SLD and VGluT2-positive pathways that activate inhibitory interneurons in the medullary reticular formation. Secondary loss of glycinergic (GlyT2) receptors and GABA_A receptor subunits in spinal interneurons leads to electromyographic tonic and phasic muscle activity. Dopaminergic neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars compacta (>60% by motor symptom onset) can alter REM regulation via nigrostriatal and nigropedunculopontine projections. Genetic factors include point mutations in SNCA and GBA mutations, increasing RBD risk by up to 3-fold. Inflammatory microglial activation within pontine structures releases cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), further disrupting inhibitory signaling. Energy metabolism deficits in these neurons manifest by mitochondrial complex I dysfunction and oxidative stress, reducing ATP required for vesicular GABA/glycine release. Pathological changes evolve over 5\u201315 years, with early compensatory upregulation of GABA_B receptors insufficient to restore atonia. Ultimately, widespread synucleinopathy collapses REM systems, causing dream enactment behavior.","clinical_manifestation":"The onset of RBD often precedes PD motor signs by 5\u201310 years. Initial symptoms include vivid nightmares and dream enactment, typically emerging at age 50\u201370. Frequency ranges from 2\u20134 episodes per week to nightly events. During episodes, patients exhibit punching, kicking, shouting, with potential injuries in 30% of cases. Neurological examination between episodes may be normal or show subtle parkinsonian signs: reduced arm swing (60%), resting tremor (20%), bradykinesia (40%). In younger PD patients (<60 years), RBD onset is rare, whereas in elderly (>70 years), it correlates with cognitive decline risk (dementia incidence 45% at 5 years). Gender differences: men constitute 70% of RBD sufferers, though underdiagnosis in women may bias this ratio. Associated autonomic dysfunction includes orthostatic hypotension in 25% and constipation in 40%. Severity scales, such as the RBD Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ) and the Inoue criteria, grade severity from 0\u201313; scores >5 indicate high probability. Without treatment, episodes may intensify over 2\u20135 years, increasing risk of injury and progression to overt synucleinopathy at an annual conversion rate of 6%\u20138%.","diagnostic_approach":"First, conduct a thorough sleep history focusing on dream enactment, violence during sleep, and injury risk. The initial screening tool is the RBDSQ (sensitivity 96%, specificity 88%). If positive, proceed to overnight video-polysomnography (vPSG) using the AASM protocol: EEG, EOG, chin EMG, limb EMG, at least 6 channels, capturing >2 REM episodes. Diagnostic criteria: tonic chin EMG activity >30% of REM sleep and phasic limb EMG bursts in >15% of REM epochs. The sensitivity of vPSG is 90%, specificity 95%. Laboratory workup is not routinely required but may include thyroid panel, B12, and autoimmune screens if alternative etiologies are suspected. Brain MRI (FLAIR, T2, diffusion sequences) helps exclude structural lesions, normal in idiopathic RBD. In ambiguous cases, 123I-FP-CIT SPECT (DaTscan) shows presynaptic dopaminergic deficit in 75% of RBD patients converting to PD. CSF \u03b1-synuclein oligomer assays are investigational but may show increased levels. Differential diagnosis includes OSA (AHI >15/h on PSG), nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ictal events with epileptiform discharges on EEG), and PLMD (PLM index >15/h without behavioral enactment). Key decision point: confirm dream enactment plus REM atonia loss via vPSG; otherwise, investigate alternative causes.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy is low-dose clonazepam, initiated at 0.25 mg orally at bedtime, titrated by 0.125\u20130.25 mg increments every week up to 1.0 mg depending on efficacy and tolerance; daytime sedation occurs in 20% of patients. Alternatively, melatonin 3\u201312 mg at bedtime, starting at 3 mg and increasing weekly, reduces RBD episodes by 55% at 6 weeks with minimal side effects. For refractory cases, pramipexole at 0.125 mg nightly may be considered, although evidence is limited. Avoid antidepressants such as SSRIs which can exacerbate RBD in 15% of PD patients. Non-pharmacological measures include safety-proofing the sleep environment (removing sharp objects, padding walls), bed partner education, and scheduled awakenings 10 minutes before typical episode onset. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in PD patients can indirectly improve RBD severity by optimizing dopaminergic therapy, though success rates vary (30\u201350% improvement). Regular monitoring of sedation, balance, and cognitive side effects is essential, with dose adjustments guided by follow-up vPSG after 3\u20136 months. Special considerations: in hepatic impairment, clonazepam elimination half-life may double, requiring dose reduction by 25\u201350%. In pregnancy, avoid benzodiazepines; prioritize non-pharmacological safety measures.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up should occur at 4\u20136 week intervals initially to assess medication efficacy, adherence, and side effects. Monitor frequency of RBD episodes via sleep diaries and bed partner reports, aiming for >50% reduction. Repeat vPSG after 6 months or sooner if clinical response is suboptimal. Annual clinical assessments should include UPDRS part III motor scoring to detect emerging PD signs. MRI surveillance is not routinely required unless new neurological deficits arise. Long-term, 30\u201350% of idiopathic RBD cases convert to PD or Lewy body dementia within 5 years, so monitor cognitive domains with MoCA annually. Rehabilitation referrals for balance training are indicated if parkinsonian features emerge. Educate patients on driving restrictions: avoid driving within 6 hours of clonazepam dosing or if daytime somnolence exceeds Epworth Sleepiness Scale >10. Provide resources such as the Parkinson\u2019s Foundation and International RBD Study Group for support and updated guidelines.","clinical_pearls":"1. RBD may be a prodromal marker of Parkinson\u2019s disease by up to 10 years (conversion rate 6%\u20138% annually). 2. Utilize the RBDSQ (score >5) as a high-sensitivity (96%) screening instrument. 3. Key mnemonic for RBD pathophysiology: \u201cSLD loses Gly,\u201d recalling sublaterodorsal nucleus and glycinergic inhibition loss. 4. Distinguish from PLMD: RBD includes dream enactment; PLMD shows periodic limb movements without vocalization. 5. Clonazepam 0.25 mg at bedtime reduces episodes in 80% of cases but watch sedation. 6. Recent guideline (AASM 2021) emphasizes melatonin as first-line alternative with fewer side effects. 7. Avoid SSRIs and TCAs which may exacerbate RBD in 15% of PD patients. 8. Cost-effectiveness: melatonin is low cost (<$0.50/day) and safe, whereas PSG is costly ($1,200\u2013$2,000 per study).","references":"1. Schenck CH, Bundlie SR, Mahowald MW.

In RBD, muscle atonia normally present during REM sleep is lost, leading to dream\u2010enactment behaviors that may include kicking, punching, or shouting. Longitudinal studies demonstrate that up to 80% of patients diagnosed with idiopathic RBD develop a synucleinopathy\u2014Parkinson\u2019s disease being the most common\u2014over the subsequent 10\u201315 years. The presence of RBD can precede the onset of Parkinsonian motor signs by years to decades, making it a robust prodromal marker. Clinically, the diagnosis of RBD is confirmed by polysomnography demonstrating REM sleep without atonia. Management focuses on patient and bed\u2010partner safety, often using clonazepam or melatonin to reduce injurious behaviors.","source_file":"Promotion 2023_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Sleep Neurology","import_source":"sleep_neurology_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"1","question":"Excessive daytime sleep and increasing eating habits may be treated with which of the following?","options":["SSRI","Methylphenidate (According to UpToDate)","Sodium oxybate"],"subspecialty":"Sleep Neurology","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Part Two","correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Methylphenidate (According to UpToDate)","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in disorders such as narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia is treated first-line with wake\u2010promoting agents.","pathophysiology":"According to UpToDate, methylphenidate is an established stimulant used to reduce EDS by increasing synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine.","clinical_manifestation":"Sodium oxybate is approved for narcolepsy with cataplexy but carries a risk of respiratory depression and is reserved for patients with concomitant cataplexy or severe EDS not controlled by stimulants.
