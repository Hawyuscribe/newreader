Randomized trials (DESTINY, HAMLET, DECIMAL) demonstrate that decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant MCA infarction reduces mortality by ~50% and increases the proportion of survivors with moderately severe disability (mRS 3\u20134), but few achieve mRS \u22642. Option B is incorrect\u2014craniectomy confers a survival benefit across age groups up to 60 years (DECIMAL: HR for death 0.38; 95% CI 0.18\u20130.80). Option C is false\u2014early surgery (<48h) yields better outcomes; delays beyond 72h are associated with higher mortality. Option D is incorrect; younger patients (<60) fare better (DESTINY II in >60 showed reduced mortality but higher rates of severe disability). Option E is untrue\u2014larger craniectomy (>12 cm) is associated with improved decompression and outcomes.","conceptual_foundation":"Malignant MCA syndrome is characterized by large infarct with cytotoxic edema leading to increased intracranial pressure and herniation. In ICD-11, it is coded under ischaemic stroke. Historically, medical management failed to prevent fatal edema; surgical decompression emerged in the 1990s. The pathophysiologic basis is interruption of blood flow in the MCA territory causing energy failure, sodium\u2013water influx, and vasogenic edema. Decompressive craniectomy decompresses the swollen hemisphere, reducing ICP and preventing transtentorial herniation. Neuroanatomically, the MCA supplies lateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, and deep structures via lenticulostriate arteries.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion maintains osmotic gradients. In large infarcts, loss of membrane ion pump function leads to cellular edema. The blood\u2013brain barrier becomes permeable, resulting in vasogenic edema. Intracranial compliance is exceeded, raising ICP, reducing CPP (CPP = MAP\u2212ICP), leading to secondary ischemia and herniation syndromes. Decompressive craniectomy creates extracranial space, lowers ICP by up to 40%, improves CPP, and alleviates herniation risk. Animal models show early craniectomy prevents secondary injury cascade activation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present 24\u201372 h post-infarct with worsening consciousness, contralateral hemiplegia, aphasia if dominant, and signs of elevated ICP (headache, vomiting, bradycardia, hypertension). Malignant edema develops in ~10% of large MCA strokes. Without surgery, mortality approaches 80%. With craniectomy, mortality falls to ~30\u201340%, but ~60\u201370% of survivors have mRS 4\u20135 at 12 months. Prognosis correlates with age, extent of infarct, timing of surgery (<48h better), and preoperative GCS.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on clinical exam and neuroimaging. CT head shows infarct hypodensity involving >50% MCA territory; midline shift \u22655 mm predicts malignant edema. MRI DWI can detect early infarct volume. ICP monitoring is rarely used preoperatively. Decision for surgery is based on infarct size, age (<60 yrs), and NIHSS. Guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018) give Class I, LOE A recommendation for decompressive craniectomy within 48h in patients \u226460 years.","management_principles":"First-tier: Medical management includes head elevation, osmotherapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline), sedation, normocapnia. If refractory and criteria met (large MCA infarct, deterioration, age \u226460), perform decompressive craniectomy. Surgical technique: large fronto-temporo-parietal bone flap \u226512 cm, dural opening with expansile duraplasty. Post-op care in neuro-ICU includes ICP monitoring, hemodynamic optimization. Trials (DECIMAL, DESTINY, HAMLET) demonstrate reduced mortality (HR ~0.4) and improved mRS compared to medical care. Contraindications: bilateral infarcts, severe comorbidities.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative follow-up includes serial CT scans at 24 and 72 h to assess edema resolution. Monitor for complications: hygroma, syndrome of the trephined, infection. Rehabilitation begins early, focusing on motor re\u2010education, speech therapy for aphasia, and occupational therapy. Long-term follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months includes mRS and Barthel Index assessments. Cranioplasty is typically performed after 6\u201312 weeks.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early (<48h) decompression in patients \u226460 improves survival and functional outcome. 2. Survivors often have mRS 4\u20135; counsel families regarding disability. 3.

The NIHSS score is 16 and blood pressure is 200/140. What is the next step?","options":["Drop blood pressure below 185/110 then give tPA","Cut perfusion"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Drop blood pressure below 185/110 then give tPA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Drop blood pressure below 185/110 then give tPA): This is definitively correct. According to AHA/ASA guidelines, elevated systolic BP above 185 or diastolic BP above 110 must be lowered to reduce risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Studies show that transient antihypertensive infusion (e.g., labetalol 10\u201320 mg IV bolus) lowers BP within 5\u201310 minutes in over 80% of patients. In the landmark NINDS trial, only patients with BP controlled prior to tPA had an intracerebral hemorrhage rate under 6%. Option B (Cut perfusion): Incorrect; deliberately reducing cerebral perfusion pressure would worsen ischemia. Only in malignant infarction with refractory intracranial hypertension might permissive hypotension be considered, but never acutely before thrombolysis. Misconception arises from therapeutic hypothermia concepts but does not apply. Option C (Proceed directly to thrombectomy): Although mechanical thrombectomy is indicated within six hours for large vessel occlusion and NIHSS \u22656, a normal CTA rules out proximal occlusion. Thrombectomy in this CTA-normal scenario offers no benefit and risks vascular injury. Option D (Observe without treatment): Watchful waiting is contraindicated. Data show untreated NIHSS \u226515 patients have 30-day mortality near 25%, and functional independence at three months below 15%. Delaying reperfusion misses the 4.5-hour window and increases core infarct volume by 1.9 mL per hour.","conceptual_foundation":"The ischemic stroke treated with tPA involves occlusion of a cerebral artery, most often the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The MCA supplies lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Embryologically, these arteries derive from the dorsal aorta via the internal carotid system at around four weeks gestation. The Circle of Willis provides collateral pathways, including the anterior communicating and posterior communicating arteries. The oligemia penumbra is tissue at risk but still salvageable if reperfusion occurs within four and a half hours. Historically, stroke management evolved from purely supportive care in the 1950s to the advent of intravenous fibrinolysis after the NINDS trial in 1995. Landmark CT imaging protocols were established in the 1980s to exclude hemorrhage. Key anatomical landmarks on noncontrast CT include the insular ribbon and early signs like loss of gray-white differentiation. The basal ganglia, internal capsule, and corona radiata are especially vulnerable to infarction, leading to contralateral motor and sensory deficits. Understanding this anatomy is essential for localizing stroke syndromes and guiding reperfusion therapy.","pathophysiology":"Acute ischemic stroke begins when arterial occlusion triggers energy failure in neurons. Decreased oxygen and glucose shut down mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, causing ATP depletion within seconds. The Na+/K+ ATPase pump fails, leading to neuronal depolarization and massive glutamate release. Activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors allows Ca2+ influx, initiating intracellular cascades involving calpains, phospholipases, and endonucleases that damage membranes and DNA. Reactive oxygen species accumulate, exacerbating membrane lipid peroxidation. Genetic polymorphisms in coagulation factors, such as Factor V Leiden (G1691A) or MTHFR C677T, may increase thrombosis risk. Inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 amplify endothelial activation, leukocyte adhesion, and the ischemic penumbra\u2019s expansion. Microglial activation further releases nitric oxide and proteases. Within minutes to hours, the core infarct expands as collateral flow fails. Microvascular obstruction by leukocyte plugging and platelet adhesion compounds injury. Over subsequent days, macrophage infiltration clears debris, and reactive gliosis occurs, limiting regenerative potential. The limited window for tPA therapy correlates with the time before irreversible core enlargement exceeds salvageable penumbra volume by perfusion-diffusion mismatch imaging.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset begins abruptly, often with maximal deficit within seconds to minutes. In MCA strokes, patients present with contralateral hemiplegia affecting face and arm more than the leg, contralateral hemisensory loss, and expressive or receptive aphasia if the dominant hemisphere is involved. NIHSS score of 16 reflects moderate to severe impairment, combining motor (up to 4 points per limb), language, and visual fields. In younger adults, strokes often present with isolated deficits, whereas elderly patients may have fluctuating symptoms due to collateral variability. Gender differences include slightly higher prevalence of posterior circulation symptoms in women. Systemic signs such as hyperglycemia occur in 30% of acute strokes and worsen outcomes. Red flags include sudden onset headache, vomiting, and decreased consciousness, which might indicate hemorrhage. Without treatment, neurological deficits plateau within 24 hours, and secondary complications like edema peak at 3\u20135 days. Severity scales include the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for long-term outcome and Barthel Index for functional independence. Early identification of red flags and appropriate blood pressure control are critical to prevent infarct expansion and hemorrhagic transformation.","diagnostic_approach":"Step one is immediate noncontrast head CT within 20 minutes of arrival to exclude hemorrhage with sensitivity over 95% for acute blood. Concurrent CT angiography (CTA) evaluates for large vessel occlusion with sensitivity 88% and specificity 95%. If CTA is normal, no proximal clot is present, ruling out thrombectomy. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging has sensitivity up to 98% for acute ischemia but is less practical emergently. Laboratory tests should include CBC, platelet count (normal 150\u2013450 \u00d7 10^3/\u03bcL), PT/INR (target <1.7), PTT (25\u201340 seconds), blood glucose (70\u2013140 mg/dL), and electrolytes. Cardiac biomarkers and ECG assess for atrial fibrillation. Carotid duplex ultrasound evaluates extracranial stenosis (>70% requires endarterectomy). Transcranial Doppler assesses intracranial flow velocities. Lumbar puncture is not indicated unless hemorrhage is suspected but CT is negative and clinical picture suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage. Continuous telemetry and echocardiogram detect cardioembolic sources. Differential diagnoses include hypoglycemia, seizure with Todd\u2019s paralysis, complicated migraine, and conversion disorder, distinguished by labs and imaging findings.","management_principles":"For eligible acute ischemic stroke patients presenting within 4.5 hours, administer IV alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg): 10% as bolus over one minute, remainder infused over 60 minutes. Before infusion, lower BP if >185/110 mm Hg using labetalol 10\u201320 mg IV or nicardipine infusion at 5 mg/h, titrated by 2.5 mg/h every five minutes up to 15 mg/h. Monitor BP every 15 minutes for two hours, then every 30 minutes for six hours, targeting <180/105 mm Hg. If allergic or tPA-contraindicated, consider tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg bolus for large vessel occlusion within 4.5 hours (emerging evidence). Mechanical thrombectomy is indicated for NIHSS \u22656 when CTA shows proximal occlusion in internal carotid or M1 segment within six hours (extended to 24 hours by DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials in select perfusion mismatch patients). Maintain euglycemia (target 140\u2013180 mg/dL) and normothermia. Manage complications such as angioedema (~1% incidence) with IV methylprednisolone and histamine blockers, and intracerebral hemorrhage with reversal protocols. In renal impairment, adjust alteplase infusion pump parameters but do not alter dosing.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute management, reassess neurological status daily using NIHSS and mRS at discharge. Schedule follow-up visits at two weeks, one month, three months, and annually. Monitor blood pressure aiming for <130/80 mm Hg using ACE inhibitors or thiazides. Lipid profile should be repeated at three months; target LDL <70 mg/dL with high-intensity statin therapy. Carotid imaging at six weeks if stenosis previously identified. Echocardiography at three months for cardioembolic source evaluation. Screen for diabetes every six months, maintaining HbA1c <7%. Surveillance brain MRI at one year if symptomatic or recurrent TIAs. Long-term complications include post-stroke epilepsy (incidence 5\u201312%) and depression (30%). Rehabilitation begins immediately, with physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Driving re-evaluation is recommended after three months of stable deficits. Provide patient education on lifestyle modification, antiplatelet adherence, and stroke support organizations like the American Stroke Association. Assess home safety and caregiver support continuously, adjusting the care plan accordingly.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always lower BP below 185/110 mm Hg before tPA; uncontrolled hypertension increases hemorrhage risk by over 50%. 2. NIHSS \u226516 predicts large infarct core; rapid intervention improves outcomes by 30%. 3. Normal CTA rules out proximal occlusion, so direct thrombectomy is not indicated. 4. Labetalol IV bolus onset is 5\u201310 minutes; nicardipine drip offers finer titration. 5. The NINDS trial established tPA window within 3 hours; ECASS III extended it to 4.5 hours. 6. Penumbra salvageable tissue shrinks by 1.9 mL per hour; time is brain. 7. Watch for angioedema in tPA-treated patients on ACE inhibitors (~1% incidence). 8. Landmark DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials support thrombectomy out to 24 hours in select patients. 9. Use ASPECTS scoring (0\u201310) on CT for early ischemic changes; <6 suggests poor tPA outcome. 10.

Vertebral dissection. The clinical context\u2014minor trauma during tennis, normal initial CT, delayed onset of contralateral homonymous hemianopia two hours later\u2014is most consistent with artery dissection leading to posterior circulation infarct of the occipital lobe. Carotid or vertebral artery dissections may have a latent period before symptom onset as intramural hematoma propagates. CT head is often normal initially; MRI/MRA or CTA reveals the dissection flap or double lumen. Option B (RCVS) typically presents with thunderclap headaches, reversible segmental vasoconstriction on angiography, and focal deficits are rare. Option C (PRESS, presumably PRES) occurs in severe hypertension, eclampsia, immunosuppression, and shows characteristic parieto-occipital vasogenic edema on MRI. Option D (ICA stenosis) causes anterior circulation stroke syndromes\u2014amaurosis fugax, hemisensory/motor deficits\u2014not isolated homonymous hemianopia from occipital lobe infarction.","conceptual_foundation":"Cervical artery dissection involves an intimal tear allowing blood to form an intramural hematoma, narrowing the lumen, and potentially causing thromboembolism. Dissections are classified under ICD-11 8B11.22. Risk factors include minor trauma (e.g., sports), connective tissue disorders, and hypertension. Differential diagnoses include intracranial hemorrhage (CT positive), RCVS, PRES, vasculitis, and cardioembolic stroke. Historically, arterial dissection was underrecognized until imaging advances (CTA, MRA) allowed noninvasive diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"Normal vertebral arteries supply the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), brainstem, and occipital lobes via the posterior cerebral arteries. Dissection begins with an intimal tear, blood extravasation into the media forming a false lumen. This compresses the true lumen causing hypoperfusion and can release emboli distally, causing infarction in the posterior circulation territories. In contrast, PRES is due to endothelial dysfunction and breakdown of autoregulation in severe hypertension, leading to vasogenic edema rather than infarction. RCVS involves transient vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries without vessel wall tear.","clinical_manifestation":"Vertebral artery dissection often presents with neck pain (50\u201360%) and occipital headache ipsilateral to lesion, followed by ischemic symptoms (e.g., ataxia, cranial nerve deficits, visual field cuts) hours to days later. Homonymous hemianopia occurs when the posterior cerebral artery territory is affected. PRES presents with seizures, headache, visual disturbances but typically bilateral edema on MRI and often hypertensive encephalopathy. RCVS yields thunderclap headache recurrent over days to weeks, with transient segmental narrowing on angiography but minimal focal deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial noncontrast CT head has low sensitivity for acute posterior fossa infarction (<50%). MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and MRA or CTA of neck arteries is first-line (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~99%). T1-weighted fat-saturated MRI can visualize intramural hematoma. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains gold standard but is invasive. Transcranial Doppler has limited utility for posterior circulation. Early imaging within 24 hours is crucial. Workup also includes echocardiography and hypercoagulable panel if no trauma.","management_principles":"Management of cervical artery dissection is with antithrombotic therapy\u2014either antiplatelet (e.g., aspirin 325 mg daily) or anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin INR 2\u20133) for 3\u20136 months (Class IIa, level B evidence from CADISS trial showing no difference in stroke recurrence between antiplatelet and anticoagulant). Blood pressure control (target <140/90 mmHg) is recommended. Endovascular stenting is reserved for worsening stenosis or contraindications to medical therapy. Thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy follow standard acute ischemic stroke protocols if within window and large vessel occlusion.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow patients at 1, 3, and 6 months with clinical exam and repeat vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) to assess vessel healing. Most dissections heal by 3\u20136 months; persistent narrowing may require prolonged therapy or stenting.

The 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines recommend starting prednisone at 40\u201360 mg/day (or roughly 1 mg/kg up to 60 mg); some experts advocate doses up to 80 mg/day in cases with visual symptoms. Option A (perform ESR) would delay therapy, and option C (start prednisolone 40\u201360 mg/day) while broadly acceptable, does not meet the higher end dosing recommended when vision is threatened. Thus, B is the most appropriate next step.","source_file":"Promotion 2018_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","import_source":"vascular_neurology_stroke_mcqs.json"}]
