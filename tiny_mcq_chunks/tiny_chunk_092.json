[{"question_number":"4","question":"A patient suddenly explained to his wife that he is seeing animals and then fades away. After a while, the patient loses consciousness. Upon arrival, the emergency medical team intubates him and a computed tomography (CT) scan shows a new left occipital stroke. What will you do?","options":["CTA","EEG","tPA","None of the above"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"CTA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: CTA (computed tomography angiography). In the hyperacute phase of suspected ischemic stroke involving large vessels, CTA is recommended to identify occlusions amenable to endovascular therapy. Although the patient initially had a seizure with visual hallucinations (suggesting occipital lobe involvement), the CT scan demonstrates a new left occipital stroke. CTA will rapidly assess intracranial and extracranial vessels. EEG (B) is not indicated acutely for stroke evaluation; tPA (C) requires confirmation of an ischemic stroke without hemorrhage within the treatment window, but additional vascular imaging helps select candidates. \u201cNone of the above\u201d (D) would omit critical imaging needed for acute management.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute ischemic stroke occurs when a cerebral artery is occluded, leading to parenchymal infarction. Rapid identification of vessel status guides reperfusion strategies. CTA provides high-resolution images of arterial anatomy, identifying LVOs and tandem lesions. Seizures can occur at stroke onset, particularly in cortical strokes, but do not preclude imaging or reperfusion. Acute stroke protocols integrate noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, followed by CTA to plan therapy.","pathophysiology":"Ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion causing energy failure, cytotoxic edema, and eventual infarction. In the occipital cortex, infarction disrupts the primary visual pathway, leading to cortical blindness or visual hallucinations (release phenomena). Seizure activity may arise from acute cortical irritation. CTA visualizes the occlusion site and collateral circulation, informing potential thrombectomy decisions. In contrast, EEG detects electrical activity but does not localize vascular lesions or guide revascularization.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute occipital stroke often presents with visual field deficits (e.g., homonymous hemianopia), visual agnosia, and in some cases visual hallucinations (elementary or formed). Seizures at onset occur in up to 3\u20135% of ischemic strokes, more frequently in cortical involvement. The evolution of deficits and imaging findings confirms infarction. Early vascular imaging is crucial to determine eligibility for reperfusion therapies within recommended time windows.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast CT is first-line to exclude hemorrhage. CTA should follow immediately in hyperacute stroke (within 6 hours of onset) to assess for large vessel occlusion (Class I, Level A recommendation, AHA/ASA 2018). Perfusion imaging (CTP or MRI perfusion) may be added in extended window presentations. EEG is reserved for evaluating ongoing or nonconvulsive seizures, not for vascular assessment. tPA administration follows CT findings and is time-dependent; vascular imaging optimizes patient selection for thrombectomy.","management_principles":"Endovascular thrombectomy is indicated for anterior circulation LVO within 6 hours (Class I, Level A) and selected patients up to 24 hours based on perfusion imaging (DAWN/DEFUSE 3 trials). CTA findings of occlusion and collaterals determine procedure candidacy. Intravenous tPA remains standard for eligible patients within 4.5 hours of onset, but vascular imaging does not delay administration if no occlusion imaging is required for tPA decision.","follow_up_guidelines":"After reperfusion therapy, follow-up neuroimaging (CT or MRI) is performed at 24 hours to assess for hemorrhagic transformation. Vascular imaging (CTA/MRA) at 5\u20137 days evaluates recanalization and residual stenosis. Long-term secondary prevention includes antithrombotic therapy, risk factor control, and rehabilitation. Seizure prophylaxis is not routinely indicated unless recurrent seizures occur.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always perform vascular imaging (CTA) immediately after noncontrast CT in suspected LVO. 2. Seizure at stroke onset does not exclude reperfusion therapies. 3. EEG is not a substitute for vascular imaging in acute stroke. 4. CTA rapidly identifies thrombectomy candidates and guides endovascular planning. 5. Visual hallucinations can be a release phenomenon in occipital lobe infarcts.","references":"1.

For minor ischemic strokes (NIHSS \u22645) without disabling deficits, the CHANCE and POINT trials demonstrated that short\u2010term DAPT (21\u201390 days) started within 24 hours reduces the risk of early recurrent stroke (relative risk reduction ~32 %) compared with aspirin alone, with an acceptable risk of bleeding. Option B (tPA) is reserved for patients with disabling deficits (Class I, Level A), not for non\u2010disabling minor stroke. Option C (aspirin alone) is less effective at preventing early recurrence in this subgroup (POINT trial: 5.6 % recurrence with aspirin alone vs 4.1 % with DAPT at 90 days; HR 0.68; 95 % CI 0.52\u20130.90).","conceptual_foundation":"Minor stroke is defined by NIHSS \u22645 and non\u2010disabling deficits in AHA/ASA guidelines. Key differentiation is disabling versus non\u2010disabling; sensory loss and mild facial weakness are considered non-disabling. The goal is early secondary prevention. Mechanistically, small\u2010vessel or minor large\u2010artery events predominate. Differential includes TIA (symptom resolution within 24 hours) but this patient has persistent deficits. Historical management favored aspirin monotherapy until CHANCE (2013) and POINT (2018) established benefit of DAPT in early minor stroke.","pathophysiology":"Acute ischemic stroke arises from thrombosis over an atherosclerotic plaque or small\u2010vessel lipohyalinosis. Platelet activation via COX-1 and ADP P2Y12 pathways triggers aggregation at the site of endothelial injury. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1, reducing thromboxane A2, while clopidogrel blocks P2Y12, synergistically reducing platelet aggregation. Early initiation of DAPT stabilizes the culprit lesion and reduces microembolic events.","clinical_manifestation":"Minor stroke with persistent hemisensory loss (left body) and mild facial weakness that does not substantially impair function.

In giant cell arteritis (GCA), the most common ophthalmic complication is arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) resulting from inflammation and occlusion of the short posterior ciliary arteries. Hayreh (1984) demonstrated that occlusion of these arteries leads to optic nerve head infarction, presenting with sudden painless vision loss. Option D (GCA) describes the underlying disease but does not specify the mechanism of visual loss. Options B and C (retinal artery occlusions) present with characteristic fundoscopic findings (cherry red spot) which are not described in this scenario.","conceptual_foundation":"GCA is a large-vessel vasculitis affecting branches of the carotid artery, predominantly the temporal arteries and ophthalmic artery branches. According to the 1990 ACR criteria, diagnosis requires \u22653 of: age \u226550, new headache, temporal artery abnormalities, elevated ESR, and arterial biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation. AION in GCA arises from vasculitic occlusion of the posterior ciliary circulation supplying the optic nerve head.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, the optic nerve head receives blood from the short posterior ciliary arteries. In GCA, a T-cell\u2013mediated granulomatous inflammation causes intimal proliferation and luminal narrowing in these vessels. This leads to ischemia of the optic nerve head, causing sudden vision loss and a pale waxy swelling of the optic disc. The inflammatory cascade involves interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma, driving vessel wall infiltration and occlusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with new-onset headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication (facial pain on chewing), and systemic symptoms (fever, malaise). Visual symptoms include monocular vision loss which may be transient at first (amaurosis fugax) before becoming permanent. Fundoscopy reveals pale segmental swelling of the optic disc without hemorrhages, distinguishing arteritic AION from non-arteritic AION.","diagnostic_approach":"Immediate evaluation includes ESR, CRP, and complete blood count. An ESR >50 mm/hr and CRP >2.5 mg/dL support the diagnosis. Temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard, showing granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells. Color duplex ultrasonography may reveal the 'halo sign.' High pretest probability warrants empiric corticosteroid therapy prior to biopsy to prevent further vision loss.","management_principles":"High-dose corticosteroid therapy is the cornerstone. Intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days) is recommended in cases with visual involvement, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). Adjunctive low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of ocular and cerebral ischemic complications. Steroid taper is guided by clinical response and inflammatory markers over 1\u20132 years.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor visual acuity and fields weekly initially, then monthly. ESR and CRP guide tapering of corticosteroids. Bone density, blood glucose, and blood pressure should be monitored during long-term steroid therapy. Relapse rates are 20\u201350%, warranting vigilance for new symptoms.","clinical_pearls":"1. Jaw claudication is highly specific for GCA. 2. AION in GCA shows pale disc edema, unlike hyperemic swelling in non-arteritic AION. 3. Start steroids immediately in suspected GCA to prevent bilateral blindness. 4.

It falls under ICD-11 code 8A31. It must be differentiated from RCVS, infectious vasculopathies, malignancies, and demyelinating lesions. Historically, classification evolved from empirical nomenclatures to the Calabrese and Mallek criteria (1988) requiring both clinical and histological evidence. Pathological specimens show transmural lymphocytic infiltrates, granulomas, and fibrinoid necrosis. Definitive diagnosis informs aggressive immunosuppression.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral small vessels maintain autoregulation via endothelial nitric oxide and prostacyclin. In CNS vasculitis, T\u2010cell\u2013mediated immune responses target vessel walls, causing endothelial damage, fibrinoid necrosis, luminal narrowing, and ischemia.

Unlike RCVS, there is no reversible vasoconstriction but permanent vessel wall destruction.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is insidious over weeks to months with headache (70%), cognitive decline (60%), focal deficits (50%), and seizures (30%). CSF often shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (<50 cells/\u00b5L) and protein elevation (50\u2013100 mg/dL). MRI reveals multifocal hyperintense T2 lesions, often enhancing.
