Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP) is caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.4, leading to aberrant gating and episodic muscle fiber inexcitability. Multiple cohort studies (Statland et al. 2015; Sansone et al. 2020) report that up to 80% of patients with HyperPP harbor SCN4A mutations with characteristic attacks of flaccid weakness lasting minutes to hours. Option A (Ca channel defect) corresponds to hypokalemic periodic paralysis with CACNA1S mutations. Option C (Cl channel defect) causes myotonia congenita (CLCN1 mutations) presenting with delayed muscle relaxation, not episodic weakness. Option D (K channel defect) is seen in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (KCNJ2 mutations) featuring periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphism. Common misconceptions include conflating all periodic paralyses with calcium channel defects; in fact, high-potassium triggers and normal to elevated serum K+ levels point to sodium channelopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Periodic paralyses are hereditary muscle channelopathies characterized by transient episodes of weakness due to ion channel dysfunction. They are subdivided by serum K+ levels during attacks into hyperkalemic, hypokalemic, normokalemic, and congenital forms. HyperPP is autosomal dominant, associated with SCN4A gene mutations (ICD-11 8B7Z.0). Differential diagnoses include thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, Andersen-Tawil syndrome, and periodic paralysis secondary to metabolic or endocrine disorders. Embryologically, voltage-gated sodium channels arise from mesodermal somitic myoblast differentiation. Nav1.4 is localized in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle fibers, particularly at the neuromuscular junction and T-tubules. Understanding the taxonomy, genetic basis, and triggers is essential to classify and manage periodic paralyses.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle contraction depends on precise opening and inactivation of Nav1.4 sodium channels. In HyperPP, SCN4A mutations create a gating pore leak current or impair fast inactivation, causing persistent inward Na+ flux. This sustained depolarization inactivates sodium channels, rendering the membrane unexcitable and leading to transient flaccid paralysis. Increased extracellular K+ (e.g., from dietary potassium) further depolarizes the sarcolemma. Compensatory mechanisms such as Na+/K+-ATPase activity may transiently restore membrane potential post-attack. Cellular insights from Wittekindt et al. (2019) demonstrate that mutant channels have a 2\u20135-fold increase in window currents, correlating with attack severity.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in adolescence or early adulthood with episodic attacks of limb weakness lasting minutes to a few hours. Facial, ocular, bulbar, and respiratory muscles are usually spared. Attack frequency ranges from weekly to monthly. Common triggers include ingestion of high-potassium foods (bananas, potatoes), rest after exercise, and cold. Between episodes, neurological examination is normal. Rarely, mild permanent weakness or fixed myopathy can develop after prolonged disease. A detailed history of trigger events and family history of similar episodes aids diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by demonstration of elevated or high-normal serum potassium during an attack. The long exercise test on EMG shows a characteristic decrement in compound muscle action potential amplitude (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). Genetic testing for SCN4A mutations confirms the diagnosis (detection rate ~60\u201380%). Rule out secondary causes with thyroid function tests, serum electrolytes, and renal function. Muscle biopsy is generally not informative. Pre-test probability is high in patients with typical history and triggers; post-test probability after positive genetic testing approaches 99% (LR+ >50).","management_principles":"Acetazolamide (250\u2013500 mg/day) is first-line prophylaxis and reduces attack frequency by inducing mild metabolic acidosis and increasing renal potassium excretion (AAN 2022 class I, level B). Thiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily) are alternatives. Acute attacks are treated with inhaled salbutamol (2\u20134 puffs) or oral glucose plus insulin to shift K+ intracellularly. Patients should avoid known triggers (high-K+ foods, rest immediately after exercise). Monitoring for side effects such as metabolic acidosis and kidney stones is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require periodic assessment of attack frequency, serum electrolytes, and medication tolerance (every 3\u20136 months). Annual EMG long exercise testing may assess subclinical disease progression. Genetic counseling is recommended for family planning. Pediatric patients need growth and developmental monitoring. Adjust therapy based on clinical response, and screen for possible fixed myopathy in long-standing cases.","clinical_pearls":"1.

This disorder is defined by asynchronous involvement of two or more peripheral nerves in separate limbs, presenting with sensory and motor deficits. Elevated ESR (62 mm/h) and NCS/EMG demonstrating axonal lesions in distal radial, ulnar, and deep peroneal nerves strongly support an inflammatory vasculitic etiology. Option A (limb-onset ALS) involves progressive UMN and LMN signs without sensory loss or elevated inflammatory markers. Option C (multifocal motor neuropathy) is a purely motor neuropathy with conduction block and no sensory involvement. Option D (CIDP) shows a symmetric demyelinating polyneuropathy rather than patchy mononeuropathies.","conceptual_foundation":"Mononeuritis multiplex occurs when necrotizing inflammation of the vasa nervorum leads to ischemic nerve infarctions in multiple noncontiguous nerves. It is commonly associated with systemic vasculitides (e.g., polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis, rheumatoid vasculitis). In ICD-11 it is classified under 8A90.x peripheral neuropathies. Differential diagnoses include diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy, leprosy, Lyme disease, and multifocal motor neuropathy. Understanding the distinction between axonal ischemic injury and immune-mediated demyelination is pivotal.","pathophysiology":"Vasculitic neuropathy results from immune complex\u2013mediated or ANCA-associated necrotizing inflammation of endoneurial and epineurial vessels, causing vessel wall destruction, luminal occlusion, and nerve ischemia. This leads to segmental axonal degeneration and Wallerian degeneration distal to the lesion. In contrast, CIDP features a demyelinating immune attack on Schwann cell myelin. The acute onset and stepwise progression of deficits reflect successive vascular ischemic events.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in middle age with acute or subacute asymmetric sensory loss, neuropathic pain, and motor weakness corresponding to individual nerve distributions (e.g., wrist drop, foot drop). Constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss) and systemic signs of vasculitis may coexist. Exam findings include patchy deficits with preserved reflexes proximal to the lesion and muscle atrophy in chronic cases. Without treatment, irreversible deficits accumulate.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes nerve conduction studies showing multifocal axonal loss, elevated ESR/CRP, ANCA, ANA, rheumatoid factor, and complement levels. MRI neurography may reveal nerve enlargement and T2 hyperintensity. Nerve biopsy of an accessible affected nerve yields diagnostic confirmation in ~60% of cases. CSF analysis is usually normal. Pre-test probability is increased in the presence of systemic vasculitis symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers.","management_principles":"First-line therapy involves high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) often combined with cyclophosphamide for severe or refractory disease, followed by maintenance immunosuppression with azathioprine or methotrexate. Rituximab is an alternative for ANCA-associated vasculitis.

It must be differentiated from myasthenia gravis (postsynaptic AChR/MuSK antibodies) and from inherited channelopathies. Pathogenically, antibodies bind to P/Q-type VGCCs on motor nerve terminals, reducing calcium influx and quantal release of acetylcholine. Clinically, LEMS presents with proximal muscle weakness (lower limbs > upper), bulbar symptoms, autonomic features (dry mouth, constipation), and areflexia. Embryologically, VGCC \u03b11A subunits (CACNA1A gene) are expressed in dorsal root ganglia and motor neurons.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuromuscular transmission depends on depolarization-induced opening of P/Q-type VGCC, allowing Ca\u00b2\u207a influx and vesicular acetylcholine exocytosis. In LEMS, anti-P/Q VGCC antibodies reduce channel density/function, decreasing evoked end-plate potentials and causing muscle weakness. Complement activation and receptor internalization further damage presynaptic terminals. High-frequency nerve stimulation produces incremental CMAP responses due to mobilization of residual calcium. Over time, chronic antibody-mediated damage leads to compensatory sprouting and partial recovery between exacerbations.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop insidious proximal limb weakness (hips > shoulders), difficulty arising from chairs, climbing stairs, and bulbar weakness (dysarthria, dysphagia).
