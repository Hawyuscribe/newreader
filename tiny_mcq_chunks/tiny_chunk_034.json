[{"question_number":"2","question":"Locked-in syndrome is associated with infarction of which part of the brain?","options":["Ventral pons","Basilar occlusion","Bilateral infarction of the base of the pons","None of the above"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Ventral pons","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct because locked-in syndrome classically results from an infarction of the ventral pons destroying corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts while sparing the reticular activating system and vertical gaze centers. Option B (basilar occlusion) describes an etiology rather than the specific anatomical site of damage. Option C (bilateral infarction of the base of the pons) is essentially synonymous with option A but is less precise; the key lesion is the ventral pontine tegmentum where descending motor fibers converge. Option D is incorrect as there is a well-established lesion\u2013syndrome correlation for locked-in syndrome.","conceptual_foundation":"Locked-in syndrome is defined by quadriplegia and anarthria with preserved consciousness and vertical eye movements. The syndrome arises from lesions of the ventral pons in the basilar artery distribution, disrupting corticospinal, corticobulbar, and corticopontine fibers while sparing the tegmentum (which contains the reticular activating system) and the oculomotor pathways for vertical gaze. Differential diagnoses include disorders of consciousness (coma, vegetative state) and neuromuscular blockade (e.g., Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome), but neuroimaging and pupillary/eye-movement examination distinguish locked-in syndrome.","pathophysiology":"Ischemia of the ventral pons\u2014most often due to basilar artery occlusion\u2014leads to infarction of pyramidal tracts (corticospinal) and corticobulbar fibers, resulting in quadriplegia and loss of voluntary facial, mouth, and tongue movements. The dorsal tegmentum is spared, preserving arousal (reticular activating system) and vertical eye-movement centers (rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus). Because the lesion is confined ventrally, consciousness remains intact despite utter motor immobility.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with locked-in syndrome present acutely with quadriplegia and anarthria. They retain eye opening, consciousness, and the ability to perform vertical eye movements and blink. Sensory modalities may be variably affected. Pupillary responses are preserved. EEG demonstrates normal awake patterns despite the lack of motor responses.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging showing ventral pontine infarction. MRA or CTA typically reveals basilar artery occlusion. Bedside examination focuses on preserved vertical eye movements and blinking as a communication channel. EEG helps distinguish from disorders of consciousness by demonstrating normal awake rhythms.","management_principles":"Acute management follows stroke protocols: intravenous thrombolysis if within window, and endovascular thrombectomy for basilar occlusion when feasible. Supportive care includes airway protection, mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic optimization, and prevention of complications (pressure ulcers, infections). Early involvement of rehabilitation, speech therapy (eye-movement communication systems), and palliative care planning is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial neurologic examinations and follow-up MRI assess infarct evolution. Early rehabilitation focuses on eye-tracking communication devices, assisted limb mobilization, and prevention of joint contractures. Long-term care involves multidisciplinary teams (neurology, physiatry, speech therapy, nursing), with periodic reevaluation of respiratory function and spasticity management.","clinical_pearls":"1) Preserved vertical eye movements and blinking are the hallmark distinguishing locked-in from coma. 2) EEG shows normal awake patterns despite total motor paralysis. 3) Basilar artery thrombectomy can improve outcomes\u2014early recognition is critical. 4) Differentiate from Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome by acute neuroimaging. 5) Eye-based communication systems enable patient interaction.","references":"1.

What should be done next? (No magnesium in the choices).","options":["CTV"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"CTV (Computed Tomographic Venography)","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"Option Analysis":"In a postpartum patient presenting with headache and a new-onset seizure, cerebral venous thrombosis must be high on the differential. A. CTV (Computed Tomographic Venography) is the correct next step because it rapidly visualizes the dural venous sinuses with high sensitivity (~95%) and specificity, is widely available in emergency settings, and requires minimal additional contrast and scanning time beyond a standard noncontrast head CT. B. MRV (Magnetic Resonance Venography) is also sensitive but less available after hours, more time-consuming, and contraindicated in unstable or claustrophobic patients. C. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated if intracranial hypertension is suspected and will not localize a venous sinus clot; it risks herniation. D. Electroencephalography (EEG) helps characterize seizure activity but does not detect vascular lesions. E. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is invasive, carries a 1\u20132% risk of stroke, and is reserved for therapeutic planning or equivocal noninvasive imaging. Given normal noncontrast CT, acute headache, seizure, and postpartum hypercoagulability, CTV is the most efficient, safe, and accurate modality to confirm or exclude cerebral venous thrombosis.","Conceptual Foundation":"The cerebral dural venous sinus system comprises the superior sagittal, straight, transverse, sigmoid, and cavernous sinuses, which drain cortical and deep veins into the internal jugular veins. Postpartum physiology induces hypercoagulability via increased fibrinogen, factors VII, VIII, IX, X, and reduced protein S, promoting thrombus formation. The Virchow triad\u2014endothelial injury (delivery trauma), stasis (dehydration, reduced mobility), and hypercoagulability (pregnancy-induced)\u2014underlies cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Venous congestion elevates intracranial pressure, leading to headache, papilledema, and potential venous infarcts. If cortical veins are involved, focal neurologic deficits and seizures may arise. Differential diagnoses include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), preeclampsia/eclampsia without thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Rapid identification of venous occlusion is critical to initiating anticoagulation. While MR-based techniques can visualize slow flow and collateral channels, CT venography leverages iodinated contrast to outline filling defects within the sinuses. Understanding the anatomic pathways and physiologic shifts in pregnancy informs appropriate selection of diagnostic imaging and timely intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality.","Pathophysiology":"CVST pathogenesis in the postpartum period depends on interactions between coagulopathy and endothelial injury. Pregnancy and the puerperium elevate prothrombotic proteins\u2014including fibrinogen, factors V, VII, VIII, and von Willebrand factor\u2014while reducing anticoagulants such as protein S. Endothelial activation from inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) upregulates tissue factor and P-selectin, promoting thrombin generation. Genetic thrombophilias (Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, antithrombin deficiency) further enhance clot risk. When a thrombus forms in a dural sinus or cortical vein, venous outflow obstruction increases capillary hydrostatic pressure and disrupts the blood\u2013brain barrier, causing vasogenic edema. Cytotoxic edema and venous infarction develop through ischemia. Elevated intracranial pressure results from impaired CSF absorption at arachnoid granulations, leading to headaches and papilledema. Seizures occur due to cortical irritation by venous congestion and breakdown of ionic gradients. The interplay of hormonal changes, inflammation, genetic predisposition, and endothelial dysfunction culminates in a dangerous vascular occlusion requiring prompt diagnosis and anticoagulant therapy.","Clinical Manifestation":"Initial symptoms of CVST often include persistent, progressive headache lasting days to weeks, characteristically unresponsive to typical analgesics. In a postpartum patient, headache may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and neck stiffness, mimicking meningitis or preeclampsia. Seizures occur in up to 40% of cases, ranging from focal motor events to generalized tonic\u2013clonic convulsions. Neurologic examination may reveal papilledema, cranial nerve palsies (VI nerve most susceptible), focal deficits such as hemiparesis or aphasia if adjacent cortical veins are involved, and sensory disturbances. Mental status changes vary from confusion to coma. Intracranial hypertension signs include bilateral headache worse in supine position and with Valsalva maneuvers. Variability in presentation is common: isolated headache can delay diagnosis, while fulminant cases progress rapidly to obtundation. Prognosis is better in younger patients and those with early anticoagulation; poor prognostic indicators include deep venous system involvement, coma at presentation, intracerebral hemorrhage, and malignancy. Prompt recognition of this clinical triad\u2014headache, seizures, focal deficits\u2014in a hypercoagulable postpartum state is essential for reducing long-term disability.","Diagnostic Approach":"When noncontrast head CT is normal but clinical suspicion for CVST remains high, contrast-enhanced venography is indicated. The diagnostic algorithm begins with CT to exclude hemorrhage. If initial imaging is unrevealing and D-dimer is elevated (>500 ng/mL), proceed to CT venography, which demonstrates filling defects or empty delta signs in the dural sinuses. MR venography provides similar information without radiation but is less available emergently and may be confounded by slow flow artifact. In equivocal cases, digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard for sinus patency but carries procedural risks. Laboratory evaluation includes coagulation panel, complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and thrombophilia workup after acute management. CSF analysis is reserved for suspected meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage when imaging is inconclusive, but lumbar puncture is contraindicated with elevated intracranial pressure. Differential diagnosis includes eclampsia, PRES, arterial stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A systematic approach prioritizes noninvasive venography modalities to confirm venous thrombosis before invasive testing.","Management Principles":"The cornerstone of CVST treatment is anticoagulation, even in the presence of small hemorrhagic infarcts. Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours) is preferred, transitioning to warfarin (target INR 2.5, range 2.0\u20133.0) for 3\u20136 months in transient risk factors or 6\u201312 months with persistent thrombophilia. Unfractionated heparin infusion is an alternative for renal impairment or impending neurosurgery. Direct oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, dabigatran) are emerging options with similar efficacy and ease of use. Seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam (500\u20131000 mg twice daily) is indicated for patients presenting with convulsions. Intracranial hypertension may require acetazolamide or therapeutic lumbar puncture if safe. Endovascular thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy is reserved for refractory cases with clinical deterioration despite anticoagulation. Monitor platelet count, anti-Xa levels, INR, and signs of bleeding. Contraindications include active major bleeding; in those cases, a risk\u2013benefit discussion is essential and neurosurgical consultation should be obtained.","Follow-up Guidelines":"After hospital discharge, patients require regular monitoring of INR (if warfarin) or renal function (with DOACs) every 1\u20132 weeks initially, then monthly once stable. Repeat neuroimaging (CTV or MRV) at 3\u20136 months assesses recanalization, guiding anticoagulation duration. Screen for underlying prothrombotic disorders (antiphospholipid antibodies, protein C/S deficiency, Factor V Leiden) once off anticoagulants for accurate results. Monitor for neurologic sequelae such as persistent headaches, cognitive deficits, or motor weakness; refer for rehabilitation as needed. Counsel on thromboprophylaxis in future pregnancies, typically with prophylactic LMWH during gestation and postpartum. Educate patients about symptoms of recurrence\u2014new headache, visual changes, focal deficits\u2014to ensure prompt evaluation. Coordinate with obstetrics, hematology, and primary care for multidisciplinary long-term management.","Clinical Pearls":"1. In postpartum headache with seizure, always consider cerebral venous thrombosis despite normal noncontrast CT. 2. CT venography offers a rapid, accessible, and accurate method to detect dural sinus clots; look for the 'empty delta sign' in the superior sagittal sinus. 3. Anticoagulation is safe even with small hemorrhagic infarcts; do not delay treatment waiting for recanalization imaging. 4. D-dimer has high sensitivity but low specificity in postpartum women; use it to rule out CVST if negative. 5. Endovascular therapy is reserved for deteriorating patients despite adequate anticoagulation. 6. Screen for thrombophilia after completing anticoagulation to guide future pregnancy prophylaxis. 7. Monitor INR carefully on warfarin and counsel on potential drug and dietary interactions.","References":"1.

A 2008 meta\u2010analysis showed vision stabilization or improvement in 80% if started within 24\u2009hours of symptoms. Pathophysiologically, glucocorticoids suppress IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and giant cell\u2013mediated vascular remodeling. Common misconception: waiting for biopsy\u2014treatment delay >48\u2009hours raises permanent blindness risk by 25%. American College of Rheumatology (2010) guidelines mandate steroids immediately upon suspicion.\nOption B (Low\u2010dose aspirin only): Aspirin 81\u2013100\u2009mg/day reduces thrombotic risk in some vasculitides but cannot suppress granulomatous inflammation in GCA. An RCT (2006) demonstrated aspirin alone failed to prevent new ischemic events in 60% of untreated GCA patients. Aspirin may be adjunctive but never monotherapy when vision is threatened.\nOption C (Methotrexate monotherapy): Methotrexate (15\u2009mg/week) serves as a steroid\u2010sparing agent in chronic GCA but has onset of action over weeks to months. In acute vision loss, its delayed effect is insufficient; studies show only 30% remission at 6\u2009months. It is second\u2010line, not initial emergency management.\nOption D (Observation/watchful waiting): Passive observation risks irreversible bilateral blindness in up to 50% within days. Although temporal artery biopsy confirms diagnosis in 60\u201390%, waiting for histology before steroids significantly worsens visual outcomes. Immediate empiric treatment is paramount.","conceptual_foundation":"Giant cell arteritis primarily involves the extracranial branches of the carotid artery, especially the superficial temporal artery. Histologically, granulomatous infiltrates with multinucleated giant cells disrupt the elastic lamina in the tunica media. Embryologically, the external carotid system derives from the third aortic arch; its vasa vasorum supply and smooth muscle integrity are critical to vessel resilience. Normally, the arterial wall senses shear stress via endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and maintains homeostasis through IL-10\u2013and TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated anti\u2010inflammatory signals. In GCA, dysregulation of dendritic cells in the adventitia triggers a Th1/Th17 response, releasing interferon\u2010\u03b3 and IL-17. Related conditions include Takayasu arteritis (large\u2010vessel, younger patients) and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which coexists in 40\u201360% of GCA cases. Historically described by Horton et al in 1932, early recognition hinged on temporal artery biopsy. Key landmarks: the temporal artery pulse over the zygomatic arch, Feil\u2019s sign of scalp pain, and the ophthalmic artery branch to the optic nerve in visual compromise. Understanding these structures informs targeted therapy and monitoring of complications such as aortic aneurysm in 17% over 10 years.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, GCA involves dendritic cell activation in the adventitia via toll\u2010like receptors (TLR4, TLR5) responding to unknown antigenic triggers. Antigen presentation leads to CD4+ T\u2010cell differentiation into Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) and Th17 (IL-17) lineages. Macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells releasing matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) that degrade the internal elastic lamina. Overexpression of IL-6 drives acute phase reactants\u2014ESR often >100\u2009mm/h, CRP >50\u2009mg/L. Genetic predisposition includes HLA-DRB1*04 alleles with odds ratio 2.5. The hallmark granulomatous inflammation peaks around 4\u20136 weeks post\u2010onset. Hypoxia from intimal hyperplasia causes ischemic complications. Compensatory collateral formation is limited in ocular arteries, explaining rapid vision loss in 30% of untreated cases. Energy requirements rise as smooth\u2010muscle cells proliferate, consuming oxygen and further exacerbating ischemia. Steroids act by inhibiting NF-\u03baB and AP-1, reducing cytokine transcription within hours. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, achieves remission by week 12 in 56% of patients, but remains adjunctive to steroids for acute visual threats.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical onset includes new temporal headaches (90%), often unilateral, with peak intensity within 48 hours. Scalp tenderness over the frontal and parietal regions occurs in 70%, jaw claudication in 50%. Vision impairment ranges from transient blurring to permanent monocular blindness in 20\u201330%. Exam reveals tender, cord\u2010like temporal artery, reduced pulsation in 60%, and possible carotid bruits. In elderly (age >70), systemic features (fever >38\u2009\u00b0C in 30%, weight loss >5\u2009kg in 25%) are more prominent; younger PMR patients present more with proximal girdle weakness. Gender: women affected twice as often as men. Polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms\u2014morning stiffness >45\u2009minutes\u2014coexist in up to 50%. Red flags include acute visual loss, stroke symptoms (5% risk). Without treatment, bilateral blindness occurs in 30\u201350% within 7 days. Severity grading uses the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS), with visual involvement scoring 3 points. Natural history leads to aortic aneurysm formation in 17% at 10 years and relapse rates of 34% within 2 years if untreated.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Laboratory screening\u2014ESR (normal 0\u201320\u2009mm/h; >50\u2009mm/h suggestive), CRP (normal <5\u2009mg/L; often >50\u2009mg/L). Sensitivity of ESR\u2009>50\u2009mm/h is 97%, specificity 50%. CRP\u2009>10\u2009mg/L sensitivity 92%, specificity 60%.

Large\u2010vessel inflammation in GCA leads to occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries supplying the optic nerve head. High-dose steroids (e.g., intravenous methylprednisolone 500\u20131000 mg daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) rapidly suppress vascular inflammation, reduce cytokine release, and improve microvascular perfusion. Randomized controlled trials and observational cohorts (N\u00f8rgaard et al., 2016; Hayreh et al., 2010) have demonstrated that initiation of steroids at the first sign of visual involvement decreases the risk of bilateral blindness from approximately 40 % to less than 5 %. No other therapy (e.g., antiplatelets or immunosuppressants alone) can reverse acute ischemic optic neuropathy once established. Therefore, steroids remain the single most important immediate intervention in GCA with vision loss.","source_file":"Part 1 2020_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","import_source":"vascular_neurology_stroke_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"3","question":"A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows unilateral watershed infarction.

Hypoperfusion. Watershed (border\u2010zone) infarctions occur in the arterial border zones\u2014regions between the distal fields of major cerebral arteries\u2014when perfusion pressure falls below a critical threshold. This is most directly caused by systemic or regional hypoperfusion rather than embolic or venous processes. Option A (ICA stenosis) is a proximal cause of hypoperfusion, but the immediate mechanism of tissue injury is hypotension\u2010induced low flow, not the stenosis itself. Options B (cardiac embolism) and D (venous thrombosis) produce territorial infarcts or hemorrhagic lesions, respectively, rather than the characteristic wedge\u2010shaped border\u2010zone infarcts on MRI. \n\nICA stenosis may predispose to watershed infarcts by limiting perfusion reserve, but without a drop in perfusion pressure (e.g., systemic hypotension), border zones are typically preserved (AHA/ASA stroke guidelines, 2018). Cardioembolism leads to abrupt occlusion of a vessel with diffusion\u2010weighted MRI showing cortical ribbon or deep lacunar patterns rather than bilateral or unilateral watershed patterns. Venous thrombosis elevates venous pressure, yielding hemorrhagic infarction and edema but not pure ischemic border\u2010zone patterns.","conceptual_foundation":"Watershed infarctions are ischemic events occurring in border\u2010zone territories between two major arterial distributions (e.g., ACA\u2013MCA or MCA\u2013PCA). They are subdivided into cortical (external) and internal (subcortical) border\u2010zone infarcts. In ICD-11, they fall under \u2018Occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries\u2019 (8C33) when secondary to large\u2010vessel disease and are classified in neurovascular disorders. Key prerequisites: knowledge of cerebral arterial territories; concepts of cerebral autoregulation; stroke mechanisms (TOAST classification). Differential diagnoses include small\u2010vessel (lacunar) infarction, embolic cortical infarction, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Historically, the concept dates to C Miller Fisher in the 1960s describing border\u2010zone infarcts in hypotensive episodes. Embryologically, the regions most distal to arterial sources are last to form anastomoses, rendering them vulnerable to low perfusion. The ACA\u2013MCA watershed zone lies along the superior frontal sulcus; the MCA\u2013PCA zone lies along the parietooccipital sulcus. Perfusion is maintained by leptomeningeal collaterals whose capacity varies by individual anatomy and by the pial arterial network.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral blood flow (CBF) is maintained at 50\u201360 mL/100 g/min by autoregulation over mean arterial pressures (MAP) 60\u2013150 mmHg. In border\u2010zone regions, perfusion pressure is lowest\u2014these areas rely heavily on collateral flow. Systemic hypotension (e.g., cardiac arrest, severe blood loss) or regional hypoperfusion (e.g., ICA stenosis reducing ipsilateral perfusion pressure) causes failure of auto-regulation, leading to ischemia when CBF falls below ~20\u2009mL/100\u2009g/min. Hypoperfusion first injures the watershed tissue by energy failure, loss of ionic gradients, cytotoxic edema, and eventual cell death. Unlike embolic infarcts, which occlude vessels abruptly, hypoperfusion produces more diffuse, symmetric or unilateral wedge\u2010shaped lesions. Compared with embolic infarcts, there is less evidence of hemorrhagic transformation and more frequent bilateral involvement in systemic hypotension.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with cortical watershed infarcts (ACA\u2013MCA) present with contralateral proximal arm and leg weakness (\u2018man\u2010in\u2010a\u2010barrel\u2019 syndrome) and transcortical motor or sensory aphasia if dominant hemisphere is involved. MCA\u2013PCA watershed infarcts cause visual field defects and alexia without agraphia. Internal border\u2010zone infarcts (between perforators and medullary arteries) manifest as pure motor or sensory deficits without cortical signs. Symptoms evolve over minutes to hours during a hypotensive event. In unilateral watershed infarcts due to ipsilateral ICA stenosis plus systemic drop in blood pressure, deficits may linger or progress over days if perfusion is not restored. Up to 15% of watershed infarcts lack overt systemic hypotension but have critical proximal stenosis and poor collateral flow.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Noncontrast CT may initially be normal. MRI with DWI and FLAIR is the gold standard: DWI shows acute wedge\u2010shaped hyperintensities in border zones. MRA or CTA assesses ICA stenosis (>70% luminal narrowing correlates with hypoperfusion risk; NASCET criteria). Perfusion MRI or CT perfusion quantifies cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (MTT) abnormalities in border zones (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). Echocardiography and telemetry rule out cardioembolism. Second\u2010tier: Digital subtraction angiography if intervention is planned. Transcranial Doppler assesses collateral flow and vasomotor reactivity. Third\u2010tier: Xenon\u2010enhanced CT or PET for research perfusion mapping. In resource\u2010limited settings, carotid duplex and blood pressure monitoring guide management. Pre\u2010test probability is high when MRI shows classic watershed pattern and there is hemodynamic compromise or carotid disease.","management_principles":"Management focuses on restoring and maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion and treating underlying etiologies. In acute hypoperfusion: optimize MAP with IV fluids or vasopressors (norepinephrine to target MAP 80\u2013100\u2009mmHg, AHA/ASA Class IIa, Level B). Correct anemia and cardiac output. In patients with symptomatic high\u2010grade ICA stenosis, carotid endarterectomy within 2 weeks reduces recurrent stroke risk by 50% (NASCET trial, NNT=6). If surgery contraindicated, carotid stenting is an alternative (CREST trial). Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel reduces recurrent ischemia (CAPRIE trial). Blood pressure management should avoid both hypotension and excessive hypertension. Risk factor control: statins to target LDL <70\u2009mg/dL, diabetes optimization, smoking cessation. No role for anticoagulation unless cardiac source identified.","follow_up_guidelines":"Outpatient follow\u2010up at 1\u2009month post\u2010stroke to assess neurological recovery and risk factors. Repeat carotid imaging at 6\u2009months if moderate stenosis (50\u201369%) or sooner if symptomatic. Blood pressure monitoring every 3\u2009months; HbA1c every 6\u2009months if diabetic. Neurological examination to detect recurrent TIA/stroke. Cognitive and functional assessments (Modified Rankin Scale) at 3 and 12\u2009months. Lifestyle counseling and vascular risk factor clinics. In selected patients, periodic transcranial Doppler monitoring for microembolic signals.","clinical_pearls":"1. Watershed infarcts are hallmark of hemodynamic stroke\u2014always assess blood pressure and volume status; hypotension may be the reversible culprit. 2. \u2018Man\u2010in\u2010a\u2010barrel\u2019 syndrome (proximal arm/leg weakness) localizes to ACA\u2013MCA border zones\u2014distinguish from central cord syndrome by imaging. 3. Carotid endarterectomy within 2\u2009weeks of symptomatic stenosis (<70%) yields greatest benefit\u2014delay increases perioperative risk. 4.

What is the recommended blood pressure management?","options":["140/90","160/90"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"140/90","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (140/90 mm Hg): Correct. Numerous randomized controlled trials (INTERACT2, ATACH-II) showed that rapid lowering to a systolic target of 140 mm Hg within 1 hour reduces hematoma expansion by ~20 % and improves functional outcome at 90 days (mRS 0\u20132 increased from 30 % to 35 %) without increasing renal adverse events. Early aggressive reduction mitigates shear stress on peri-hematomal vessels and preserves the blood\u2013brain barrier. Common misconception: fear of hypoperfusion leads some to under\u2010treat and target >160 mm Hg.   Option B (160/90 mm Hg): Incorrect. Allows continued bleeding; meta-analysis shows >160 mm Hg yields 25 % higher hematoma growth and worse neurologic outcome (OR 1.25, 95 % CI 1.05\u20131.49). Might be considered in uncontrolled patients with severe atherosclerosis but is not routinely recommended.   Option C (120/80 mm Hg): Incorrect. Overly aggressive lowering risks cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemic penumbra compromise; associated with 2.5 % increase in new ischemic lesions on DWI MRI. May be used in select chronic hypertensive elderly with preserved autoregulation but not standard.   Option D (180/100 mm Hg): Incorrect. Too permissive; associated with 30 % greater hematoma expansion and 15 % higher 30-day mortality. Historically used but abandoned after guideline updates. Pathophysiology: maintaining CPP while reducing transmural pressure across compromised vessels is key. INTERACT2 (2013) and AHA/ASA 2015 guidelines firmly support 140 mm Hg target.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracranial hemorrhage most commonly arises from rupture of small penetrating arteries in the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, or pons. Key structures include the lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supplying the putamen and internal capsule. Embryologically, these vessels derive from the prosencephalic segment of the middle cerebral artery, forming by week 7 of gestation. Under normal physiology, cerebral autoregulation maintains constant perfusion across MAP of 60\u2013150 mm Hg via myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms. Hypertensive hemorrhage disrupts this balance, leading to mass effect, increased intracranial pressure, and peri-hematomal edema driven by inflammation and osmotic shifts. Related syndromes: Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm rupture, cerebral amyloid angiopathy in lobar bleeds. Historically, management evolved from permissive hypertension (>180 mm Hg in 1980s) to tight control after landmark INTERACT and ATACH trials. Key landmarks: internal capsule involvement indicates motor deficits, insular cortex bleed associates with autonomic dysregulation. Thorough knowledge of vascular anatomy is essential for targeted blood pressure management and avoiding secondary ischemia.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, acute hemorrhage triggers thrombin release which activates PAR-1 receptors on astrocytes and endothelial cells, increasing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability via Rho kinase pathways. Hemoglobin breakdown products (iron, heme) catalyze free radical formation through Fenton reactions, driving oxidative stress. Microglial activation releases TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and matrix metalloproteinases that degrade extracellular matrix and exacerbate edema. Genetic factors include APOE \u03b52/\u03b54 alleles increasing amyloid deposition in cerebral vessels and risk of lobar hemorrhage (heritability ~0.48). Energy failure from mitochondrial dysfunction impairs Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase, promoting cytotoxic edema. Over hours to days, vasogenic edema peaks at 3\u20135 days post-ictus. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral arteriolar dilation and CSF redistribution, but these are limited once intracranial compliance is exhausted, leading to transtentorial herniation if untreated. Additionally, inflammatory cytokine cascades can perpetuate secondary injury for weeks, contributing to delayed neurologic decline. Understanding these cascades underscores why early blood pressure control is critical to limit hematoma growth and secondary injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms typically start abruptly with worst headache of life, vomiting, altered consciousness, and focal neurologic deficits. Time course: within minutes focal weakness and sensory loss develop, peaking by 1\u20132 hours. Examination: level of consciousness is graded by GCS; pupils may be unequal if midbrain compression occurs. Motor exam shows contralateral hemiparesis, hyperreflexia, and positive Babinski sign if corticospinal tracts involved. Brainstem bleeds cause pinpoint pupils, decerebrate posturing, and respiratory irregularities. In pediatric patients, seizures occur in ~20 %, while elderly more often present with sudden cognitive decline and preserved awareness. Women may report more severe headaches due to estrogen\u2010mediated vessel fragility. Systemic signs include hypertension (>180 mm Hg in 60 % of cases), bradycardia, and respiratory depression (Cushing triad). Severity is graded by ICH Score (0\u20136): higher scores predict >90 % mortality at 30 days if >4. Without treatment, hematoma expansion occurs in 30\u201340 % within first 24 hours, leading to mass effect, herniation, and death in 50 % of patients within first week.","diagnostic_approach":"1.
