[{"question_number":"2","question":"Which medication is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy for the treatment of migraine?","options":["Acetaminophen","NSAIDs","Opioids","Ergotamine"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Ergotamine","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Ergotamine is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy because of potent vasoconstrictive effects on uterine and placental vasculature, leading to fetal ischemia, miscarriage, and teratogenicity. Acetaminophen is safe as first\u2010line. NSAIDs are used cautiously before 30 weeks but avoided late in gestation. Opioids may be used with caution under specialist guidance for refractory attacks.","conceptual_foundation":"Ergot alkaloids act as nonselective serotonin receptor agonists causing sustained vasoconstriction. In pregnancy, reduced uteroplacental perfusion can result in fetal hypoxia and growth restriction. The known teratogenic potential led to its removal from recommended therapies in pregnancy (AHS 2016).","pathophysiology":"Ergotamine\u2019s 5\u2010HT1B/1D receptor agonism induces smooth muscle contraction in uterine and placental vessels. This vasopressor action differs from the targeted cranial vasoconstriction achieved by modern triptans, making ergot compounds too nonselective and hazardous in gestation.","clinical_manifestation":"Use of ergotamine in early pregnancy carries a high risk of spontaneous abortion and neonatal malformations including limb defects and craniofacial abnormalities. Symptoms of toxicity include severe cramping, abdominal pain, and signs of fetal distress.","diagnostic_approach":"Ergotamine toxicity should be considered in pregnant patients presenting with abdominal pain, hypertension, and reduced fetal movements. Diagnosis is clinical; treatment is supportive with vasodilators and fetal monitoring.","management_principles":"Immediate discontinuation of ergotamine and initiation of uterine relaxants (e.g., nitrates) if vasospasm occurs. Fetal monitoring and obstetric consultation are mandatory. Prophylactic therapies should exclude ergot derivatives.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor fetal growth and well-being regularly in women with prior inadvertent ergotamine exposure. Serial ultrasounds to assess fetal growth parameters and placental perfusion.","clinical_pearls":"1) Ergotamines are absolute contraindications in pregnancy. 2) Differentiate between ergot and triptan mechanisms. 3) Recognize signs of ergot toxicity early. 4) Educate patients on safe abortive options. 5) Coordinate care with obstetricians.","references":"1.

Domperidone has similar action but limited availability in some countries. Ondansetron may antagonize 5\u2010HT3 receptors but offers less prokinetic benefit in migraine. Chlorpromazine is used in refractory migraine but carries more sedation and hypotension risk.","conceptual_foundation":"Migrainous nausea results from central activation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone and delayed gastric emptying, impairing oral medication absorption. Metoclopramide crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier to block D2 receptors centrally and peripherally accelerates gastric motility, improving both symptoms and drug bioavailability.","pathophysiology":"In migraine, dopaminergic hypersensitivity contributes to nausea and vomiting. Metoclopramide\u2019s antagonism of presynaptic D2 receptors in the area postrema reduces emesis, while agonism of cholinergic pathways in the gut enhances peristalsis, counteracting migraine\u2010induced gastroparesis.","clinical_manifestation":"Studies show metoclopramide relieves migraine\u2010associated nausea in up to 80% of patients and enhances efficacy of oral triptans. Extrapyramidal side effects occur in ~1\u201310% of users, often mitigated by concurrent diphenhydramine or thiethylperazine.","diagnostic_approach":"Assessment includes evaluation of nausea severity, vomiting frequency, and impact on oral medication tolerability. Metoclopramide is recommended early in the attack, ideally combined with NSAIDs or triptans for multimodal therapy.","management_principles":"Typical dosing: metoclopramide 10\u2009mg IV or IM for severe nausea, or 10\u2009mg PO. Prochlorperazine (10\u2009mg) is an alternative. Ondansetron 4\u20138\u2009mg IV is second\u2010line if D2 antagonists are contraindicated. Chlorpromazine 25\u201350\u2009mg IV or IM reserved for refractory cases in emergency settings.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms; if present, administer diphenhydramine 25\u201350\u2009mg IV. Assess efficacy of abortive regimen and adjust prophylaxis if attacks recur \u22654/month. Educate patients on recognizing side effects.","clinical_pearls":"1) Treat nausea early to improve oral drug absorption. 2) Metoclopramide has dual antiemetic and prokinetic actions. 3) Monitor for dystonic reactions. 4) Use IV formulations in emergency settings. 5) Combine with analgesics for optimal relief.","references":"1.

There are no identifiable triggers. What is the most appropriate treatment?","options":["Lamotrigine","Indomethacin","Topiramate","Amitriptyline"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Indomethacin","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B (Indomethacin) is correct. Paroxysmal hemicrania is a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia characterized by strictly unilateral, short-lasting (2\u201330 minutes), frequent attacks accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic symptoms, and it shows a complete response to indomethacin (Lance & Anthony, 1977). Lamotrigine (option A) and topiramate (option C) may be used in other headache disorders but are not diagnostic or first-line for paroxysmal hemicrania. Amitriptyline (option D) is used in chronic tension-type headache and migraine prophylaxis but is ineffective in paroxysmal hemicrania.","conceptual_foundation":"Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua, and SUNCT/SUNA. Paroxysmal hemicrania is defined by ICHD-3 criteria as \u226520 attacks of strictly unilateral pain lasting 2\u201330 minutes, frequency >5 per day, and absolute response to indomethacin. Differential diagnoses include cluster headache (longer duration, fewer attacks) and SUNCT/SUNA (ultrashort duration, cutaneous triggers).","pathophysiology":"TACs involve activation of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex, characterized by trigeminal afferent activation and efferent parasympathetic outflow via the facial nerve to cranial vasculature and lacrimal glands. In paroxysmal hemicrania, hypothalamic dysfunction may precipitate attacks. Indomethacin\u2019s mechanism likely involves cyclooxygenase inhibition, reduction in prostaglandin synthesis, and modulation of nitric oxide pathways, though precise targets remain under investigation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients experience severe, unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain lasting 2\u201330 minutes, with frequencies of up to 40 attacks per day. Attacks are associated with ipsilateral autonomic features (conjunctival injection, lacrimation, ptosis). There are no identifiable triggers such as alcohol or histamine. The absolute response to indomethacin within 72 hours confirms the diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical based on ICHD-3 criteria. Brain MRI with contrast is recommended to exclude secondary causes in atypical presentations or new onset in older patients. A therapeutic trial of indomethacin (25\u2013150 mg/day) is diagnostic if there is complete cessation of attacks within 72 hours.","management_principles":"Indomethacin is the treatment of choice, initiated at 25 mg TID and titrated to 150 mg/day as needed. Gastroprotective strategies (proton pump inhibitors) should be co-prescribed due to GI toxicity. Alternative options (COX-2 inhibitors) may be considered if indomethacin is not tolerated. Preventive agents such as verapamil or topiramate are not effective in paroxysmal hemicrania.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular side effects of indomethacin. Follow-up visits every 1\u20133 months assess attack frequency and medication tolerance. Liver and kidney function tests should be checked periodically. Dose tapering can be attempted after 6\u201312 months of complete remission.","clinical_pearls":"1. Paroxysmal hemicrania is distinguished from cluster headache by shorter attacks and complete indomethacin response. 2. Lack of triggers differentiates it from SUNCT/SUNA. 3. An indomethacin trial is both diagnostic and therapeutic. 4. Monitor for GI toxicity with high-dose indomethacin. 5. Obtain MRI in patients >50 years to rule out secondary causes.","references":"1.

What medication should be prescribed?","options":["Topiramate","Valproic acid","Propranolol","Amitriptyline"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Topiramate","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. Topiramate. Topiramate is a first-line migraine prophylactic agent, especially useful in patients with comorbid obesity or at risk for metabolic syndrome and without contraindications. In contrast, propranolol (Option C) is best avoided in type 1 diabetics due to masking hypoglycemia; valproic acid (Option B) is teratogenic and contraindicated in women of childbearing potential without strict contraception; amitriptyline (Option D) can cause weight gain and anticholinergic side effects that complicate glycemic control.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine prophylaxis rests on modulating cortical excitability and neurotransmitter systems, including GABAergic, glutamatergic, and monoaminergic pathways. Topiramate enhances GABA activity, inhibits AMPA/kainate receptors, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. Classification under ICD-11: 8A80. Migraine prophylaxis agents include beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and CGRP monoclonal antibodies.","pathophysiology":"In migraine, cortical spreading depression triggers trigeminovascular activation with release of CGRP, substance P, and neuroinflammation. Topiramate modulates neuronal excitability, reducing cortical hyperresponsiveness and inhibiting trigeminal nociceptive transmission, thereby preventing migraine aura and headache.","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine prophylaxis is indicated for patients with \u22654 headache days per month or severe attacks. Topiramate reduces monthly migraine days by ~50% in 50% of patients over 3 months (POISE trial). Adverse events: paresthesia (23%), fatigue (12%), weight loss (5%).","diagnostic_approach":"Baseline evaluation includes headache diary for 1\u20133 months, assessment of cardiovascular and renal status. No specific labs required before topiramate, but baseline bicarbonate, renal ultrasound if risk factors for nephrolithiasis.","management_principles":"Start topiramate at 25 mg nightly, titrate by 25 mg weekly to target 100 mg/day in divided doses. Monitor for cognitive slowing, paresthesia, metabolic acidosis. Class I evidence (AAN 2012) supports efficacy. Avoid in pregnancy without counseling due to potential cleft risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess efficacy and tolerability every 4\u20136 weeks. Titrate to maximum tolerated dose by 8 weeks. Once efficacy achieved for 6\u201312 months, consider gradual taper over 2\u20133 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Topiramate offers dual benefit of weight loss and migraine reduction. 2. Avoid beta-blockers in type 1 diabetics to prevent masked hypoglycemia. 3. Monitor serum bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis. 4. Educate on hydration to reduce nephrolithiasis. 5. Titrate slowly to minimize cognitive side effects.","references":"[1] Silberstein SD et al. Topiramate for migraine prevention: pooled results.
