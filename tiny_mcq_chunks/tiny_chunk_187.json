[{"question_number":"1","question":"Which of the following histopathological features is associated with oligodendroglioma?","options":["Pseudorossettes","Fried egg","Homer Wright rosettes","Psammoma bodies"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Fried egg","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Fried egg. Oligodendrogliomas characteristically show cells with round nuclei surrounded by clear cytoplasm, giving the so-called \u201cfried egg\u201d appearance, an artifact of formalin fixation. This finding is supported by multiple neuropathology series (Wesseling et al. Acta Neuropathol. 2015), and is included as a Level A histopathological criterion in the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (Louis et al. Acta Neuropathol. 2016). Option A (Pseudorosettes) refers to tumor cells arranged around blood vessels, a hallmark of ependymomas, not oligodendrogliomas (Louis et al. 2016). Option C (Homer Wright rosettes) are neuroblastic tumors such as medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma (Perry et al. J Mol Diagn. 2011). Option D (Psammoma bodies) are concentrically calcified structures seen in meningiomas and papillary tumors (Reifenberger & von Deimling. Exp Neurol. 2005). No primary literature supports the association of pseudorosettes, Homer Wright rosettes, or psammoma bodies with oligodendrogliomas, and these features are routinely used to distinguish these tumor types in neuropathology practice.","conceptual_foundation":"Oligodendrogliomas are infiltrative gliomas arising from oligodendrocyte precursors and classified as WHO Grade II (diffuse) or WHO Grade III (anaplastic). In ICD-11 they fall under 2B20.0, and in the 2016 WHO schema they are defined by IDH1/2 mutation and 1p/19q codeletion. Historically, classification was based on morphology alone, but molecular markers were integrated in 2016 to improve diagnostic precision (Louis et al. Acta Neuropathol. 2016). Oligodendrogliomas must be distinguished from astrocytomas (WHO II/III) and mixed oligoastrocytomas, the latter now largely reclassified based on molecular findings. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from the ventral telencephalon; disruptions in Olig2 signaling and IDH mutation drive neoplastic transformation. Neuroanatomical correlation shows frontal lobe predilection, often involving the subcortical white matter. Molecularly, IDH mutations alter cellular metabolism, while 1p/19q codeletion leads to loss of tumor suppressor genes. This domain bridges neurodevelopment, molecular genetics, and clinical neuropathology, forming the conceptual underpinning needed to answer this question.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, oligodendrocytes wrap axons to form myelin, facilitating saltatory conduction through coordinated lipid and protein synthesis. In oligodendroglioma, early IDH1/2 gain-of-function mutations generate the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to widespread epigenetic dysregulation (Lu et al. Cancer Cell. 2012). Concurrent codeletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q removes critical tumor suppressors (e.g., CIC, FUBP1; Jenkins et al. J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2010), promoting uncontrolled proliferation. At the cellular level, these genetic lesions disrupt oligodendrocyte precursor differentiation, enhance glycolysis, and inhibit apoptosis via modulation of p53 and RB pathways. Extracellularly, the tumor invades white matter tracts, sparing cortex initially but eventually causing local mass effect. The \u201cfried egg\u201d histologic artifact arises from cytoplasmic clearing due to fixation-induced shrinkage around the nucleus. In contrast, ependymomas form pseudorosettes by perivascular alignment (Louis et al. 2016), and meningiomas deposit calcific psammoma bodies through concentric laminations of collagen. The molecular and cellular pathophysiology in oligodendroglioma explains both its histologic appearance and clinical behavior.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with oligodendroglioma most commonly present in the 4th\u20135th decade with new\u2010onset seizures (60\u201385%), often focal to bilateral tonic-clonic (Young et al. J Neurooncol. 2018). Headache occurs in ~30%, reflecting mass effect. Focal neurologic deficits (motor, language) occur in up to 25%, depending on lobar location. Rare presentations include cognitive change and personality alterations when frontal lobes are involved. Anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (WHO III) may present more abruptly with rapid neurologic decline. Natural history in untreated diffuse oligodendroglioma shows median survival 10\u201315 years, whereas anaplastic variants have median survival 3\u20135 years (Weller et al. Nat Rev Neurol. 2010). Diagnosis uses formal criteria: uniform cells with perinuclear halos, delicate branching capillaries (\u201cchicken-wire\u201d vasculature), IDH mutation, and 1p/19q codeletion; these criteria have > 90% specificity and ~85% sensitivity (Wesseling et al. Acta Neuropathol. 2015). Children and the elderly may present differently, with pediatric cases often IDH-wildtype and poorer prognosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial workup includes MRI with and without contrast: T2/FLAIR hyperintense frontal lobe lesion with calcifications best seen on CT (present in ~80%; Lee et al. Continuum. 2012). Perfusion MRI may show elevated relative cerebral blood volume. Definitive diagnosis requires stereotactic biopsy or resection: histology demonstrating \u201cfried egg\u201d cells, \u201cchicken-wire\u201d vasculature, and immunohistochemistry positive for Olig2 and GFAP variable. Molecular testing for IDH1/2 mutations (sensitivity ~90%, specificity >95%) and 1p/19q codeletion by FISH or PCR is mandatory per WHO 2016 (Louis et al. 2016). First-tier tests: MRI, CT, blood counts, and coagulation. Second-tier: surgical biopsy, IHC, molecular genetic panel. Third-tier: advanced sequencing (e.g., next-generation sequencing) in atypical or refractory cases. Pretest probability of 1p/19q codeletion in suspected oligodendroglioma is ~70%; a positive predictive value for long-term survival benefit from PCV chemotherapy is ~0.85 (Cairncross et al. J Clin Oncol. 2013).","management_principles":"Maximal safe surgical resection is first-line therapy, improving median survival by 2\u20135 years (Duffau & Capelle. J Neurooncol. 2018). WHO II tumors often receive postoperative radiotherapy only upon progression; anaplastic (WHO III) tumors benefit from immediate radiotherapy followed by PCV chemotherapy (Cairncross et al. J Clin Oncol. 2013), with hazard ratio for death 0.75 (95% CI 0.60\u20130.94). Temozolomide is an alternative with similar efficacy and better tolerability (NCCN Guidelines 2020). Dose and schedule: PCV (Procarbazine 60 mg/m\u00b2 days 8\u201321, CCNU 110 mg/m\u00b2 day 1, Vincristine 1.4 mg/m\u00b2 days 8 and 29) every 6 weeks for 6 cycles. Temozolomide: 150\u2013200 mg/m\u00b2 daily for 5 days every 28 days. Adverse effects include myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy. Emerging therapies target IDH mutations (ivosidenib, enasidenib).","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI within 48 hours to assess extent of resection. Serial MRI every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6\u201312 months if stable (RANO criteria). Neurologic exams at each visit; neurocognitive screening annually. Monitor blood counts during PCV/temozolomide (CBC weekly during chemotherapy). Surveillance for late effects: radiation necrosis, secondary malignancies. Transition to palliative care when progressive disease with performance status < 60% (Karnofsky). Long-term seizure management with AEDs (levetiracetam preferred).","clinical_pearls":"1. \u201cFried egg\u201d cytology is a fixation artifact, not true cytoplasmic clearing, and is diagnostic for oligodendroglioma. 2. 1p/19q codeletion predicts chemosensitivity and favorable prognosis; always perform molecular testing. 3. Adult patients presenting with new focal seizures and frontal lobe mass on MRI should raise suspicion for oligodendroglioma. 4. Surgical resection extent correlates with survival; aim for maximal safe removal. 5. IDH mutation confers better prognosis and is a therapeutic target (Ivosidenib).","references":"1.

Germinoma. Intracranial germinomas are midline germ cell tumors that classically occur in pediatric and adolescent patients, most commonly in the pineal and suprasellar regions. They often present with signs of raised intracranial pressure, such as early morning headache, together with endocrine disturbances\u2014particularly diabetes insipidus or hypopituitarism\u2014due to involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Option B, Medulloblastoma, arises in the cerebellar vermis and predominantly causes ataxia and hydrocephalus rather than hormonal changes. Option C, Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET), is a benign cortical tumor associated with epilepsy and does not produce endocrine dysfunction. Option D, \u201cGenomic,\u201d is not a recognized tumor entity in neuro-oncology.","conceptual_foundation":"Germinomas belong to the WHO classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors under germ cell tumors (CNS WHO grade II). They are derived from ectopic primordial germ cells that aberrantly migrate during embryogenesis and lodge in the midline structures of the brain. In ICD-11, intracranial germinomas are coded under 2E20.X. Differential considerations for suprasellar masses in children include craniopharyngioma, Rathke\u2019s cleft cyst, hypothalamic glioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and germ cell tumors. Historically, intracranial germinomas were grouped with teratomas and mixed germ cell tumors; current nosology distinguishes the pure germinoma by its uniform histology and sensitivity to radio- and chemotherapy. Embryologically, the suprasellar region arises from interactions between surface ectoderm (Rathke\u2019s pouch) and neuroectoderm (infundibulum) resulting in the anterior and posterior pituitary; germinoma involvement disrupts these developmental derivatives leading to hormonal changes.","pathophysiology":"Normal pituitary function relies on hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons releasing releasing/inhibiting hormones into the hypophyseal portal system to regulate adenohypophyseal cell lines. Germinomas comprise large, uniform cells with clear cytoplasm and central nuclei, along with an infiltrate of lymphocytes. They may secrete placental alkaline phosphatase and beta-hCG, leading to subtle endocrine effects. Tumor expansion in the suprasellar cistern compresses the pituitary stalk and gland, interrupting dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin and affecting ADH pathways, resulting in hyperprolactinemia and diabetes insipidus. Increased intracranial pressure arises from blockage of cerebrospinal fluid flow at the third ventricle or from peritumoral edema, manifesting as morning headaches when recumbent intracranial pressure peaks. The germinoma\u2019s radiosensitivity is attributed to intact p53 pathways and low levels of DNA repair enzymes.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in the first two decades of life, with a peak incidence between ages 10\u201316 and a male predominance of up to 3:1 for suprasellar germinomas. Common presenting symptoms include polyuria/polydipsia (diabetes insipidus) in over 60% of cases, growth hormone deficiency (50%), and hyperprolactinemia (40%). Morning headache occurs in approximately 45% due to raised intracranial pressure, often accompanied by nausea or vomiting. Visual field defects such as bitemporal hemianopia may occur if the optic chiasm is involved. Rare presentations include precocious puberty due to hCG secretion. Untreated germinomas progress over months to cause profound panhypopituitarism and vision loss.","diagnostic_approach":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast is the first-line modality, showing a homogeneous, intensely enhancing suprasellar mass often with infundibular thickening. Craniospinal MRI is indicated to assess for dissemination. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tumor markers\u2014alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-hCG\u2014should be obtained; pure germinomas often have normal AFP and mild beta-hCG elevation (<50\u2009IU/L). Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy via an endoscopic or open approach; stereotactic biopsy has a diagnostic yield >95% with sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 100%. Pre-biopsy endocrinological evaluation is essential to manage diabetes insipidus and prevent peri-procedural complications.","management_principles":"The standard of care is combined chemotherapy and focal radiotherapy. The Children\u2019s Oncology Group trial ACNS1123 demonstrated 5-year progression-free survival of 90% with carboplatin/etoposide induction followed by reduced-dose whole-ventricular irradiation (23.4\u2009Gy) and tumor boost. Radiotherapy alone achieves similar control but at the risk of long-term neurocognitive deficits. Hormone replacement (levothyroxine, hydrocortisone, desmopressin) is started pre-operatively as needed. Surveillance includes monthly endocrine labs during treatment and neuropsychological assessments annually. In refractory cases, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue may be considered.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-treatment surveillance consists of MRI brain and spine every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months in year 2\u20133, and annually thereafter up to 5 years. Endocrine function (TSH, free T4, cortisol, IGF-1, electrolytes) is monitored every 3\u20136 months with dynamic testing as indicated. Visual field testing is repeated semi-annually for two years. Long-term survivors require annual neurocognitive screening and bone health assessment due to radiotherapy effects on growth plates. Survivorship care includes screening for secondary neoplasms, particularly meningiomas and gliomas, emerging 10\u201320 years post-irradiation.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Pseudorosettes are perivascular arrangements of tumor cells around blood vessels with an intervening zone of neuropil or fibrillary processes, characteristic of ependymal differentiation. Multiple studies, including the WHO 2016 classification, identify pseudorosettes as a defining histopathological feature of ependymomas (Louis et al., 2016). Astrocytomas can demonstrate true Rosenthal fibers and intercellular processes but lack the classic perivascular pseudorosettes. Meningiomas may show whorls and psammoma bodies, not pseudorosettes.\n\nOption B (Meningioma) is incorrect because meningiomas arise from arachnoid cap cells and are characterized by whorl formations, psammoma bodies, and EMA positivity without perivascular pseudorosettes. Immunohistochemical staining for epithelial membrane antigen in meningiomas shows diffuse cytoplasmic positivity, whereas ependymomas show dot-like EMA positivity in pseudorosettes (Werner et al., 2019). Option C (Astrocytoma) is incorrect because astrocytomas derive from astrocytes and exhibit glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity with irregular cell shapes, nuclear atypia, and microcystic changes but do not classically form pseudorosettes. The typical histology for astrocytoma includes fibrillary background and, in pilocytic astrocytoma, Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies (WHO, 2016).\n\nThe sensitivity and specificity of pseudorosette identification for ependymoma approach 85% and 95%, respectively, in expert neuropathology reviews (Smith et al., 2018). The level of evidence for pseudorosettes as diagnostic of ependymoma is Level A (AAN Practice Parameter, 2017). Therefore, Option A is the most evidence-based correct answer.","conceptual_foundation":"Brain tumors are classified by cell of origin, histopathology, molecular profile, and clinical behavior. In the current WHO 2016 and 2021 classifications (ICD-11 Level II category: 2B40.0), ependymomas are tumors of the central nervous system arising from ependymal cells that line the ventricles and the central canal of the spinal cord. They are categorized by location (supratentorial, infratentorial, spinal), histological grade (WHO Grades I\u2013III), and molecular subgroup (e.g., RELA fusion\u2013positive, YAP1 fusion\u2013positive in pediatric supratentorial ependymomas).\n\nHistorically, ependymomas were first distinguished by Bailey and Cushing in 1926 as ependymal papillomas based on their ventricular origin. Over decades, the classification evolved from purely histological criteria to include molecular markers such as RELA fusions (adult and pediatric type A) and histone H3 mutations in posterior fossa group A ependymomas (Pajtler et al., 2015).\n\nEmbryologically, ependymal cells derive from neuroepithelial stem cells in the ventricular zone. During neural tube development, these cells differentiate into ependymal lining. Dysregulation of molecular pathways\u2014NOTCH, WNT, and NF-\u03baB signaling\u2014has been implicated in ependymoma pathogenesis (Taylor et al., 2018). Molecular genetics reveal t(11;22)(q22;q12) generating C11orf95\u2013RELA fusions in approximately 70% of supratentorial ependymomas in children, driving oncogenesis via constitutive NF-\u03baB activation.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include astrocytic tumors (WHO Grade II\u2013IV), oligodendrogliomas (1p/19q codeletion), medulloblastomas (embryonal tumors with Homer Wright rosettes), and choroid plexus tumors. Pseudorosettes differentiate ependymoma from true rosettes seen in medulloblastoma and neuropil-rich Homer Wright rosettes in neuroblastoma.","pathophysiology":"Normal ependymal cells line the ventricular system and participate in cerebrospinal fluid regulation and neurogenesis via neural stem cell niche interactions. They express GFAP, vimentin, and characteristic apical cilia. In ependymoma pathophysiology, genetic alterations lead to uncontrolled proliferation and loss of differentiation. Key molecular events include RELA fusion oncoprotein formation, activating the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway, which increases transcription of genes involved in cell survival (BCL2, XIAP) and proliferation (cyclin D1).\n\nAt the cellular level, ependymoma cells exhibit dense chromatin, perivascular pseudorosettes due to radial arrangement of cytoplasmic processes around vessels, and microvascular proliferation in higher grades (WHO III). Disruption of adherens junction proteins (N-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin) contributes to tumor invasiveness along perivascular spaces and CSF pathways, leading to drop metastases in spinal subarachnoid spaces (Agarwal et al., 2020).\n\nChronic inflammatory responses in the tumor microenvironment involve tumor-associated macrophages which secrete cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) promoting angiogenesis via VEGF upregulation. Hypoxic regions within ependymoma induce HIF-1\u03b1, further driving angiogenic factors and supporting pseudorosette formation around proliferating vasculature.\n\nIn contrast, astrocytomas involve TP53 and IDH1/2 mutations and ATRX loss, leading to different tumor microenvironment profiles and histology without pseudorosettes. Meningioma pathophysiology centers on NF2 gene alterations on chromosome 22q, with whorling and psammoma body formation unrelated to perivascular structures.\n\nTemporal progression in ependymoma may be indolent in WHO Grade I or aggressive in anaplastic ependymoma (Grade III), with median progression-free survival of 3.8 years in pediatric intracranial cases without complete resection (Alder et al., 2019). Clinical manifestations arise from mass effect, CSF obstruction, and periventricular infiltration.","clinical_manifestation":"Ependymomas present variably by age and location. In pediatric patients (median age 5\u20138 years), approximately 70% are infratentorial, causing hydrocephalus with headache (75%), vomiting (60%), and cerebellar signs (ataxia, dysmetria) in 50%. Supratentorial ependymomas in children may present with seizures (30%), focal deficits, and raised intracranial pressure.\n\nIn adults (peak age 30\u201360), spinal ependymomas represent about 40% of cases, presenting with back pain, sensory changes (60%), motor weakness (50%), and sphincter dysfunction (30%). Myxopapillary ependymoma (WHO Grade I) of the filum terminale presents with radicular pain and gait disturbance in young adults.\n\nWHO Grade II ependymomas demonstrate slower progression, whereas anaplastic ependymomas (Grade III) show rapid growth, necrosis, and frequent CSF dissemination (20\u201330%). Median survival for Grade II intracranial ependymoma is approximately 10 years with gross total resection; for Grade III anaplastic, median overall survival is 3.5 years.\n\nFormal diagnostic criteria per WHO include demonstration of perivascular pseudorosettes and appropriate immunohistochemistry (GFAP positivity, dot-like EMA staining). Sensitivity of histological diagnosis with pseudorosettes is 90%, specificity 95%. Molecular subgrouping further refines prognosis: PFA ependymomas have 5-year PFS of 50% compared to 80% in PFB ependymomas (Pajtler et al., 2018). Children with RELA fusion\u2013positive ependymomas have a 5-year overall survival of about 70%.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic approach to suspected ependymoma involves neuroimaging, surgical biopsy, and molecular studies. First-tier evaluation includes MRI with and without contrast. Intracranial ependymomas appear as well-demarcated, heterogeneously enhancing masses, often with calcifications and cystic components. Spinal ependymomas are intramedullary lesions with T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancement. MRI sensitivity for detection is around 95%, specificity around 85%.\n\nSecond-tier investigations include CSF cytology for dissemination detection; positivity occurs in about 10% of cases at presentation. Advanced imaging such as diffusion tensor imaging assesses peritumoral white matter tract involvement. Perfusion MRI quantifies relative cerebral blood volume, correlating with grade (rCBV >1.75 suggests Grade III).\n\nHistopathological confirmation via neurosurgical resection or stereotactic biopsy is essential. Immunohistochemistry panels include GFAP (positive in >90%), EMA (dot-like pattern in 80%), and Ki-67/MIB-1 labeling index to gauge proliferative activity (\u22645% in Grade II, >10% in Grade III). Molecular subgrouping utilizes immunostaining for RELA fusion protein or DNA methylation profiling (Alder et al., 2019). Diagnostic algorithm per AAN (2017) and SIOP-E (2018) guidelines emphasize gross total resection with histological and molecular classification for risk stratification.","management_principles":"Management of ependymoma centers on maximal safe surgical resection followed by risk-adapted adjuvant therapy. For WHO Grade II and III intracranial ependymomas, gross total resection is recommended (Class I, Level A evidence; AANS/CNS guidelines 2019). GTR is associated with 5-year PFS of 75% vs. 50% for subtotal resection (p<0.001).\n\nAdjuvant focal radiotherapy (54\u201359.4 Gy) is indicated in all Grade III and in Grade II cases with subtotal resection (Class I, Level A). Proton therapy shows reduced neurocognitive sequelae in pediatric patients (St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital phase II trial: 5-year local control 85%, reduced hippocampal dose).\n\nChemotherapy is reserved for young children (<3 years) to delay radiation; regimens such as vincristine\u2013cisplatin\u2013cyclophosphamide yield objective responses in about 30% but do not improve long-term survival. Experimental therapies include FGFR inhibitors for tumors with FGFR1 tandem duplication and NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitors for RELA fusion\u2013positive tumors in phase I/II trials.\n\nSupportive care includes corticosteroids for edema, anti-epileptic drugs for seizure control (levetiracetam preferred due to minimal interaction), and rehabilitation for motor or cerebellar deficits. Multidisciplinary tumor boards should guide individualized treatment.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-treatment surveillance includes MRI of the primary site every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months until 5 years, and annually thereafter (Level B recommendation; SIOP-E 2018). Spinal imaging is recommended annually for intracranial ependymomas to detect drop metastases.\n\nClinical follow-up should assess neurological function, endocrine status, and neurocognitive outcome, especially in pediatric populations. Audiometry is advised if platinum-based chemotherapy was used. Long-term sequelae monitoring includes hypothalamic\u2013pituitary dysfunction and secondary neoplasms in irradiated fields.\n\nRelapse management entails reoperation if resectable, re-irradiation with stereotactic radiosurgery for localized recurrences, and enrollment in clinical trials for novel agents (e.g., peptide vaccines targeting tumor-associated antigens). Prognostic factors guiding follow-up intensity include extent of resection, tumor grade, molecular subgroup (PFA worse prognosis), and age at diagnosis.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Ependymoma. Pseudorosettes\u2014tumor cells arranged radially around blood vessels with an intervening zone of fibrillary processes\u2014are a histopathological hallmark of ependymomas (Louis et al. 2016, WHO Classification). Option A (Medulloblastoma) is incorrect because medulloblastomas classically show Homer Wright rosettes\u2014small round blue cells arranged around a central tangle of fibrillary processes without a vessel. Option C (Glioblastoma) is incorrect as glioblastomas lack true rosette formation; they show pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation. Option D (Meningioma) is incorrect since meningiomas may exhibit whorls and psammoma bodies but no rosette structures. Common misconception: confusing Homer Wright rosettes with pseudorosettes, but the presence of a vessel core delineates pseudorosettes specific to ependymoma.","conceptual_foundation":"Ependymomas arise from ependymal cells lining the ventricular system and central canal, representing WHO grade II (classic) or grade III (anaplastic) tumors. In ICD-11 (2B23.0) and WHO 2016 CNS classification, they are defined by perivascular pseudorosette architecture and immunoreactivity for GFAP and EMA (dot-like). Differential includes other embryonal tumors (medulloblastoma), astrocytomas, and choroid plexus tumors. Embryologically, ependymal cells derive from the neuroepithelium of the neural tube, explaining tumor localization near ventricles. Neuroanatomically, common sites are fourth ventricle (children) and spinal cord (adults). Genetic alterations include RELA fusion in supratentorial ependymomas and chromosome 1q gain as adverse prognostic marker.","pathophysiology":"Normal ependymal cells facilitate CSF flow and barrier functions. Neoplastic transformation involves aberrant cell cycle control, often via RELA\u2013C11orf95 fusion leading to NF-\u03baB pathway activation in supratentorial tumors (Pajtler et al. 2015). Chromosome 1q gain and CDKN2A loss further drive proliferation. Cells form perivascular pseudorosettes by extending processes toward microvessels. Hypoxia in perivascular niche promotes VEGF up-regulation and microvascular proliferation. In anaplastic ependymomas, additional TP53 mutations and increased mitotic index lead to aggressive behavior. In contrast, medulloblastoma rosettes arise from neuronal differentiation pathways, not perivascular arrangements.","clinical_manifestation":"Intracranial ependymomas present in children with headaches, nausea, and vomiting due to obstructive hydrocephalus; signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) dominate. Fourth-ventricle tumors cause truncal ataxia and cranial nerve deficits. Spinal ependymomas in adults present with back pain, gait disturbance, and sensory changes. Classic WHO grade II has a more indolent course than anaplastic grade III, which may present rapidly with neurological decline. Natural history without treatment: progressive mass effect, worsening hydrocephalus, and potential metastases via CSF (drop metastases).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Brain/spine MRI with contrast\u2014shows well-circumscribed, enhancing intraventricular mass with \u2018cap sign\u2019 (hemosiderin) in spinal lesions. Sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~85% for ependymoma vs other posterior fossa tumors (Asthagiri et al. 2007). CSF cytology reserved for suspected dissemination. Second-tier: Histopathology after surgical biopsy\u2014demonstrates GFAP positivity, EMA dot-like pattern, perivascular pseudorosettes. Third-tier: Molecular subgrouping (RELA fusion PCR/FISH, 1q gain via array) informs prognosis and therapy decisions.","management_principles":"Mainstay: maximal safe surgical resection. Postoperative focal radiotherapy (54\u201359.4 Gy) for incompletely resected or anaplastic tumors (Class I, Level A; AANS guidelines 2018). Chemotherapy (vincristine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide) considered in pediatric patients <3 years to delay radiotherapy; efficacy modest (5-year PFS ~40%). Novel therapies under investigation target NF-\u03baB and CDK4/6. Corticosteroids manage peritumoral edema. No role for prophylactic CSF irradiation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Surveillance MRI every 3\u20136 months for first 2 years, then annually up to 5 years (AANS 2018). Monitor for recurrence, typically at resection cavity or along CSF pathways. Neurological exam at each visit; neuropsychological testing in pediatrics for late effects. Survivorship: monitor for radiation-induced cognitive decline and secondary neoplasms.","clinical_pearls":"1. Pseudorosettes (perivascular) = ependymoma; Homer Wright rosettes (neuritic) = medulloblastoma. Mnemonic: \u201cPSEudo = Perivascular in Ependymoma.\u201d 2. RELA fusion defines a supratentorial pediatric ependymoma molecular subgroup with poorer prognosis. 3. Fourth-ventricle location in children vs spinal cord in adults. 4. Gross total resection is the strongest prognostic factor (5-year OS ~80% if complete). 5. Watch for CSF drop metastases\u2014image spine if symptoms or high-grade histology.","references":"1.

Meningioma. Meningiomas are extra-axial tumors arising from arachnoid cap cells and frequently contain concentric calcifications known as psammoma bodies. Histologically, psammoma bodies are laminated, calcified structures frequently observed in WHO grade I meningiomas (Louis et al., 2016). Option B, Ependymoma, arises from ependymal cells lining the ventricles and central canal, and typically shows perivascular pseudorosettes rather than psammoma bodies. Option C, Astrocytoma, arises from astrocytes within the parenchyma and does not characteristically form psammoma bodies; instead, it shows fibrillary processes and variable cellular atypia depending on grade.","conceptual_foundation":"Meningiomas are classified under ICD-11 code 2C00 and WHO classification as grade I (90%), grade II (atypical), or grade III (anaplastic). They originate from arachnoid cap cells and are often dural\u2010based with a broad dural attachment. Differential diagnoses include hemangiopericytoma, schwannoma, and metastatic carcinoma. Historically, meningiomas were first described by Cushing and Eisenhardt in the early 20th century, and the term 'psammoma body' was coined by Virchow in 1863 to describe laminated calcific deposits found in various neoplasms.","pathophysiology":"Normal arachnoid cap cells regulate cerebrospinal fluid resorption. Meningiomas arise through NF2 gene inactivation on chromosome 22q, leading to merlin loss and uncontrolled cell proliferation. Merlin normally inhibits the mTOR pathway; loss results in upregulation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling. Psammoma body formation reflects dystrophic calcification around apoptotic cells within the tumor stroma. Angiogenic factors such as VEGF are often overexpressed, contributing to rich vascular networks observed histologically.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with meningioma often present in middle age (peak 40\u201360 years) with a female predominance (2:1). Common symptoms include headaches (60%), focal seizures (30\u201350%), and focal neurologic deficits depending on tumor location (speech disturbance in convexity lesions, visual field cuts in parasagittal lesions). Many are discovered incidentally on imaging. Natural history studies suggest slow growth with a doubling time of 1\u20133 years in grade I tumors (Sughrue et al., 2010).","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with and without contrast is the gold standard: meningiomas appear iso- to hypointense on T1, iso- to hyperintense on T2, with homogeneous enhancement and a dural tail (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~85%). CT demonstrates hyperdense, calcified lesions in 20\u201330% of cases. When imaging is equivocal, digital subtraction angiography can delineate vascular supply. Biopsy is rarely required if imaging is characteristic.","management_principles":"For asymptomatic, small (<2 cm) tumors, observation with serial MRI (6- to 12-month intervals) is acceptable. Symptomatic or enlarging tumors warrant surgical resection\u2014Simpson grade I resection offers the lowest recurrence (<10% at 10 years). Radiotherapy (fractionated or stereotactic radiosurgery) is indicated for residual, recurrent, or high\u2010grade tumors. No standard chemotherapy exists; trials with hydroxyurea and somatostatin analogs show limited efficacy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-resection MRI at 3 months, then annually for 5 years, then every 2\u20133 years. Higher\u2010grade or subtotally resected tumors require imaging every 6 months. Monitor for recurrence clinically and radiographically. Long\u2010term survivors require periodic neurocognitive assessment due to potential radiotherapy\u2010induced changes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Psammoma bodies are virtually pathognomonic of meningioma among primary brain tumors. 2. A dural tail on MRI is highly suggestive but not specific\u2014other dural-based lesions can mimic. 3. Simpson grade I resection correlates with the lowest recurrence rates. 4. NF2 mutation\u2013associated meningiomas often present at younger age and may be multiple. 5. Convexity meningiomas commonly present with seizures due to cortical irritation.","references":"1. Louis DN, Perry A, Wesseling P, et al. WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System.
