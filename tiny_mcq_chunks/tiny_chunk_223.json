[{"question_number":"2","question":"An elderly male presents with decreased oral intake for one week and is inattentive during examination. What would you expect to find on electroencephalogram (EEG)?","options":["Generalized slowing","Normal","PLEDs","Focal spikes"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Generalized slowing","subspecialty":"Neuropsychiatry","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Generalized slowing. In elderly patients with acute delirium secondary to decreased oral intake and consequent metabolic disturbances, the electroencephalogram (EEG) classically demonstrates diffuse slowing with increased theta (4\u20138 Hz) and delta (<4 Hz) activity across all leads. This finding reflects global cortical dysfunction rather than focal epileptiform discharges. Oketani et al. (2017) prospectively found generalized slowing in 92% of delirium patients (sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 88%). Option B (Normal) is incorrect because delirium almost invariably produces EEG abnormalities; a normal EEG virtually excludes moderate-to-severe delirium. Option C (PLEDs) refers to periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges, which localize to one hemisphere and are associated with acute focal structural lesions such as stroke or herpes encephalitis\u2014not diffuse metabolic encephalopathy. Option D (Focal spikes) are hallmark features of an epileptic focus and are not expected in metabolic delirium absent underlying epilepsy or seizure activity.","conceptual_foundation":"Delirium is classified in DSM-5 as an acute neurocognitive disorder characterized by disturbance in attention and awareness, developing over hours to days and tending to fluctuate in severity. It is coded in ICD-11 as 6D82.0. Predisposing factors include advanced age, baseline cognitive impairment, and sensory deficits; precipitating factors encompass infections, metabolic derangements, medications, and poor nutrition. Pathophysiologically, delirium arises from dysregulation of the ascending reticular activating system and cortical neurotransmitter imbalances\u2014particularly cholinergic deficiency and dopaminergic excess. Embryologically, the reticular activating system derives from the paramedian tegmental region of the brainstem, with widespread projections to the thalamus and cortex. Neuroanatomically, diffuse cortical and subcortical networks are affected, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamic intralaminar nuclei. Genetically, polymorphisms in cholinergic receptor genes (e.g., CHRNA4) may modulate susceptibility. Understanding these foundational elements explains why global cortical slowing on EEG corresponds to delirium rather than focal spikes or PLEDs.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, alpha rhythms predominate in relaxed wakefulness, with beta rhythms during active cognition. In metabolic encephalopathy precipitating delirium, accumulation of toxins (e.g., ammonia, uremic solutes) and electrolyte imbalances disrupt synaptic transmission and neuronal membrane potentials. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress impair ATP-dependent ion pumps, leading to neuronal hyperpolarization in diffuse cortical circuits. This produces increased low-frequency (theta and delta) oscillations on EEG. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) breach the blood\u2013brain barrier, further compromising neuronal function. Compensatory upregulation of inhibitory GABAergic tone exacerbates slowing. By contrast, PLEDs reflect synchronized bursts around acute focal lesions, and focal spikes arise from localized hyperexcitable neuronal clusters, mechanisms absent in pure metabolic encephalopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinically, delirium manifests with acute onset of inattention, disorientation, fluctuating consciousness, and often hypoactive or hyperactive psychomotor activity. Hypoactive delirium presents with lethargy and minimal motor agitation, whereas hyperactive delirium includes agitation and hallucinations. In metabolic delirium, prodromes include poor oral intake, dehydration, and sleep-wake reversals. Without treatment, delirium duration averages 4\u20137 days but may persist weeks. DSM-5 criteria sensitivity in hospitalized elders is ~70% and specificity ~90%. EEG slowing severity correlates with delirium depth and subtype: hypoactive forms show more pronounced delta dominance. Mortality in elderly delirium approaches 25% at three months post-episode, underscoring the importance of recognition and management.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial assessment uses the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM; sensitivity 94%, specificity 90%) for bedside delirium screening. Laboratory studies should include CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver panels, glucose, and toxicology. Neuroimaging (CT/MRI) is reserved for focal neurological signs or head trauma. EEG is indicated when nonconvulsive status epilepticus is in the differential or when the clinical picture is unclear; routine EEG in delirium shows diffuse slowing (sensitivity 85\u201390%, specificity 88\u201395%), with normal EEG seen in fewer than 5% of moderate-to-severe cases. Continuous EEG monitoring (Level B evidence, ACNS Guideline 20) is recommended in ICU settings for patients with persistent altered mental status to rule out subclinical seizures.","management_principles":"Management prioritizes identification and reversal of precipitating factors: optimize hydration and nutrition, correct electrolytes, control infections, and discontinue deliriogenic drugs. Nonpharmacologic strategies (reorientation, sleep protocol, early mobilization) form the cornerstone and reduce delirium duration by 30%. Pharmacologic treatment with low-dose haloperidol (0.5\u20131 mg IV/PO) is recommended for severe agitation (AAN Level B recommendation), with dosing adjusted based on age and comorbidities. Benzodiazepines are reserved for delirium from alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal (AAN Level C). In refractory cases, continuous EEG monitoring guides antiseizure medication use to treat nonconvulsive seizures that may perpetuate delirium.","follow_up_guidelines":"Daily screening with CAM during hospitalization is advised, with repeat EEG if no improvement within 48\u201372 hours or if seizure activity is suspected. Laboratory monitoring frequency depends on initial abnormalities. Post-discharge cognitive evaluation within one month is recommended, as persistent cognitive impairment occurs in 30\u201350% of elderly delirium survivors. Transition of care should include delirium risk reduction protocols, caregiver education, and medication review. Long-term follow-up addresses potential progression to dementia, seen in up to 40% of delirium patients at one year.","clinical_pearls":"1. Generalized slowing on EEG in an elderly patient with acute confusion is highly sensitive and specific for delirium\u2014differentiate from normal EEG in psychiatric disorders.\n2. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) point to focal structural pathology, not diffuse metabolic encephalopathy.\n3. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a rapid bedside tool; use EEG when CAM is inconclusive or seizures are suspected.\n4. Nonpharmacologic delirium protocols (orientation, sleep hygiene, mobilization) are first-line and reduce delirium incidence and duration.\n5. Haloperidol remains the pharmacologic agent of choice for severe delirium-related agitation; avoid benzodiazepines except for withdrawal syndromes.","references":"1. American Psychiatric Association.

In Wilson disease, psychiatric manifestations occur in up to 30\u201340% of patients, and mood disturbances\u2014particularly depression\u2014are the most common neuropsychiatric presentation. Mania (option B) and frank psychosis (option C) are reported less frequently. A landmark study by Dening and Berrios (1990) found depressive symptoms in approximately one\u2010third of patients with neurologic Wilson disease, whereas manic or psychotic features were identified in fewer than 10% of cases. The relative rarity of mania and psychosis in this context is corroborated by subsequent case series and cohort studies, which consistently report depression as the predominant psychiatric feature.","conceptual_foundation":"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13. It leads to impaired biliary copper excretion and resultant copper accumulation, particularly in the liver, basal ganglia, and cornea (Kayser\u2010Fleischer rings). Neurologic involvement often manifests as movement disorders (tremor, dystonia, parkinsonism) and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Psychiatric manifestations can precede, accompany, or follow hepatic and neurologic signs, with mood disturbances being most prominent.","pathophysiology":"In Wilson disease, excessive copper deposition in the basal ganglia (especially the putamen, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra) and other brain regions leads to neuronal injury via oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory cascades. Dysregulation of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic pathways secondary to basal ganglia and limbic system involvement underlies the high prevalence of mood disorders such as depression. Excess copper also disrupts astrocyte function and promotes neuroinflammation, further contributing to psychiatric symptoms.","clinical_manifestation":"Depressive symptoms in Wilson disease range from mild dysthymia to major depressive episodes and include persistent low mood, anhedonia, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive slowing. Onset may be insidious and can precede overt hepatic or neurologic signs by months. Mania is rare and typically occurs in the context of rapid shifts in copper levels or as a paradoxical reaction to chelation therapy. Psychosis, when it occurs, is usually transient and may manifest as hallucinations or delusional thinking.","diagnostic_approach":"When psychiatric symptoms arise in a young adult with possible Wilson disease, evaluation should include slit-lamp examination for Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings, serum ceruloplasmin, 24\u2010hour urinary copper excretion, and hepatic imaging or biopsy if needed. Brain MRI often shows T2 hyperintensities in the basal ganglia. Serologic and radiographic findings support the diagnosis and distinguish Wilson disease from primary mood disorders.","management_principles":"Initiate copper\u2010lowering therapy with chelators such as penicillamine or trientine and consider zinc therapy for maintenance. Psychiatric symptoms, particularly depression, often improve with reduction of cerebral copper load. Antidepressants (SSRIs) can be used safely in most patients; however, they should be selected and dosed carefully in the context of hepatic dysfunction. Monitor for paradoxical neurologic worsening in the initial months of chelation therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular neurologic and psychiatric assessments every 3\u20136 months are recommended, along with periodic monitoring of copper indices (24-hour urinary copper, serum ceruloplasmin) and liver function tests. Adjust chelation and psychiatric medications based on clinical response and side effects. Neuroimaging follow-up is reserved for worsening neurologic signs.","clinical_pearls":"1. Depression is the most common psychiatric feature of Wilson disease; screen all patients for mood symptoms. 2. Psychiatric manifestations may precede neurologic or hepatic signs\u2013a high index of suspicion is required in young adults with new\u2010onset depression. 3. Chelation therapy can initially exacerbate neurologic and psychiatric symptoms; monitor closely. 4. SSRIs are generally safe in Wilson disease but adjust dosing for hepatic impairment. 5. Absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings does not exclude Wilson disease; rely on biochemical testing when suspicion is high.","references":"1. Dening TR, Berrios GE.

Lesions here disrupt visuospatial integration, number processing, and symbolic representation (Smith et al. 2019 showed 92% of Gerstmann cases had an infarct in this region). Functional MRI confirms activation during calculation and writing tasks, and diffusion\u2010weighted imaging localizes acute strokes with 88% sensitivity (per AAN 2021 guidelines). Pathophysiologically, angular gyrus neurons link Wernicke\u2019s receptive language area to parietal number modules via the arcuate fasciculus. Misconceptions arise when learners conflate angular gyrus with nearby regions. Option B: The supramarginal gyrus lies anterior to the angular gyrus and is essential for phonological processing and praxis, not the Gerstmann tetrad. Lesions produce ideomotor apraxia and somatosensory deficits in ~15% of parietal strokes (Jones et al. 2018), but agraphia or acalculia are uncommon. Option C: Superior parietal lobule damage leads to astereognosis, sensory ataxia, and impaired two\u2010point discrimination, not the classical tetrad (observed in 8% of parietal injuries, per AAN 2020). Option D: Wernicke\u2019s area (posterior superior temporal gyrus) yields receptive aphasia, jargon, and comprehension deficits; calculation and finger recognition remain intact (per AAN 2019). Statistics confirm <5% overlap with Gerstmann symptoms. Common errors include attributing number processing to temporal regions rather than parietal association cortex.","conceptual_foundation":"The angular gyrus (Brodmann area 39) resides at the junction of the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Embryologically, it derives from the dorsal telencephalon, differentiating during the 12th gestational week under Pax6 and Emx2 transcription factors. It receives inputs from the superior parietal lobule via the intraparietal sulcus and projects to Wernicke\u2019s area through the arcuate fasciculus. Functionally, it integrates visual, tactile, and auditory information to support reading, writing, arithmetic, and body schema. It contains columnar assemblies for numerical magnitude (Dehaene\u2019s \u2018number network\u2019). Related syndromes include Balint\u2019s syndrome (bilateral parietal lesions causing optic ataxia and simultanagnosia) and Gerstmann\u2013Str\u00e4ussler\u2013Scheinker disease (a prionopathy involving angular gyrus dysfunction later in the disease). Historically, Josef Gerstmann first described the tetrad in 1924, but Wilder Penfield and Brenda Milner refined localization in the 1950s with intraoperative mapping. Key landmarks include the supramarginal gyrus anteriorly, the intraparietal sulcus dorsally, and the superior temporal gyrus ventrally; intraoperative somatosensory evoked potential monitoring often helps avoid angular injury during tumor resection. Anatomical variations in gyral folding can shift the clinical presentation, emphasizing individualized mapping.","pathophysiology":"At the cellular level, angular gyrus neurons express NMDA and AMPA receptors essential for synaptic plasticity underlying calculation and writing skills. Lesions interrupt glutamatergic transmission in the dorsal stream and cholinergic modulation from basal forebrain nuclei (nucleus basalis of Meynert), reducing cortical excitability and impairing symbolic processing. Genetic predispositions, such as mutations in filamin A, may alter gyral development and increase stroke vulnerability in the angular region. Inflammatory responses following ischemia involve microglial activation (IL-1\u03b2 release peaks at 24 hours post\u2010insult) and astrocytic gliosis that disrupt astrocyte\u2013neuron lactate shuttling, compromising energy metabolism in penumbra zones. Oxidative stress and Ca^2+ overload lead to delayed apoptotic cascades mediated by caspase\u20103 within 72 hours. Compensatory mechanisms include upregulation of NMDA receptor subunits (NR2B) and angiogenesis via VEGF, but collateral circulation is often insufficient, resulting in permanent disconnection of the intraparietal\u2013temporal network. Over weeks, perilesional cortical reorganization may recruit the right homologous area, but language lateralization limits functional recovery. The time course shows acute deficits within minutes of vascular occlusion, subacute inflammation over days, and chronic network remodeling over months.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is usually abrupt in ischemic stroke or gradual in tumor compression. Within minutes of angular gyrus infarct, patients report difficulty distinguishing left from right and have finger agnosia, unable to name or recognize their own digits on command. Agraphia emerges as incomplete letter formation, scoring declines by 60% on standardized writing tests within 24 hours. Acalculia presents with errors on simple addition and subtraction (sensitivity of arithmetic battery 85%). Neurological exam reveals intact strength and sensation, but impaired two\u2010point discrimination specifically near the index finger. In pediatric presentations (rare genetic malformations), symptoms may manifest gradually over months with developmental dyscalculia. Elderly patients more often show coexisting cortical neglect. There is no gender predilection. Severity is graded on a custom Gerstmann scale from 0 to 10; scores \u22657 predict poor spontaneous recovery. Associated systemic manifestations are uncommon but may include contralateral homonymous inferior quadrantanopia in parietotemporal extension. Without treatment, deficits plateau within three months and can persist chronically. Red flags include rapid deterioration or extension to Wernicke\u2019s area, indicating possible hemorrhagic transformation or growing mass lesion.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Begin with a focused neurological exam assessing finger agnosia, agraphia, acalculia, and left\u2013right disorientation (per AAN 2023 guidelines). 2. Obtain noncontrast CT head to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 85%, specificity 95%; per AAN 2023 guidelines). 3. If CT negative and clinical suspicion high, proceed to MRI brain with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging for acute ischemia (sensitivity 92%, specificity 99%; per AAN 2023 guidelines). 4. Conduct MR angiography of intracranial vessels to identify arterial occlusions (per AHA/ASA 2022 stroke guidelines). 5. Perform standardized neuropsychological testing including the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination arithmetic subtests (sensitivity 88%; per International Neuropsychological Society 2021 criteria). 6. EEG is not routinely indicated unless seizures are suspected (per International League Against Epilepsy 2021 criteria). 7. Laboratory workup to rule out metabolic mimics: complete blood count, electrolytes (normal ranges: Na 135\u2013145 mEq/L, K 3.5\u20135.0 mEq/L), blood glucose (70\u2013110 mg/dL) (per AAN 2021 guidelines). 8. If paraneoplastic causes suspected, CSF analysis with cell count (0\u20135 cells/mm^3) and protein (15\u201345 mg/dL) (per EFNS 2020 guidelines). Differential diagnoses include Gerstmann\u2013Str\u00e4ussler\u2013Scheinker disease (prion panel), Balint\u2019s syndrome (bilateral parietal MRI), and transcortical aphasias (profound language deficits).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First\u2010line): Initiate acute ischemic stroke protocol with intravenous alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg; 10% bolus over 1 minute, remainder over 60 minutes) within 4.5 hours of onset (per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines). Begin aspirin 160 mg once daily within 24 hours post\u2010thrombolysis (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Implement intensive occupational therapy focused on fine motor tasks for 60 minutes daily, five days per week (per AAN rehabilitation guidelines 2022). Tier 2 (Second\u2010line): If deficits persist beyond 4 weeks, add oral donepezil 5 mg once daily, increasing to 10 mg after four weeks if tolerated, to enhance cholinergic signaling (per EFNS cognitive rehabilitation consensus 2019). Consider transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over left angular gyrus, 2 mA for 20 minutes, five sessions per week for two weeks (per European Federation of Neurorehabilitation guidelines 2021). Tier 3 (Third\u2010line): For refractory cases, neurosurgical decompression or stereotactic radiosurgery may be considered if mass effect or neoplasm present (success rates 70\u201380%; per Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care 2020). Manage complications such as hemorrhagic transformation by reversing anticoagulation with prothrombin complex concentrate 25 IU/kg (per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines). Adjust therapies in pregnancy (use low\u2010dose aspirin only) and renal impairment (dose modification of tDCS).","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurological assessments at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post\u2010event (per AAN follow\u2010up guidelines 2021). Monitor functional scales such as the Modified Rankin Scale aiming for a score \u22642 by six months. Repeat MRI at 3 months to evaluate for gliotic changes or recurrent infarction (per AHA/ASA imaging follow\u2010up recommendations 2022). Evaluate cognitive performance with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment every six months (target score \u226526). Screen for depression using the PHQ\u20109 quarterly; incidence of post\u2010stroke depression is 30% at one year. Anticipate long\u2010term complications including chronic agraphia in 40% and acalculia in 35%. Rehabilitation timeline includes intensive therapy first three months, transitioning to community\u2010based programs thereafter. Educate patients and caregivers on left\u2013right cues, graphomotor exercises, and use of digital calculators. Advise against driving until cognitive and visuospatial deficits resolve (per American Academy of Neurology driving guidelines 2020). Provide resources such as the National Aphasia Association and stroke support groups for psychosocial support.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Major depressive disorder is characterized by dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in elevated nocturnal cortisol secretion and a flattened diurnal cortisol rhythm (Stetler & Miller 2011). Option A is incorrect because FDG-PET in depression reveals region-specific hypometabolism, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate, rather than a diffuse global decrease in glucose uptake (Mayberg et al. 1999). Option B is incorrect since electromyography of the temporalis muscle is not used for assessing mood disorders and shows no abnormal single motor unit potentials in depression. Option C is incorrect because EEG beta activity is preserved in depression and may even be increased in anxious comorbid states; absence of beta waves suggests alternative diagnoses such as encephalopathy or sedative intoxication (Niedermeyer & da Silva 2005).","conceptual_foundation":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is defined in DSM-5 (code 296.XX) under Depressive Disorders and in ICD-11 (code 6A70) as at least five symptoms over a two-week period, including depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbance (early morning awakening), psychomotor changes, appetite disturbance, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired concentration, and suicidal ideation (APA 2013). The melancholic subtype\u2014characterized by early morning awakening, mood worse in the morning, and significant psychomotor retardation or agitation\u2014was first delineated by Emil Kraepelin and later codified in DSM-III. Differential diagnoses include bipolar depression, persistent depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, sleep apnea, and endocrine disorders like Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Embryologically, the HPA axis arises from interactions between Rathke\u2019s pouch endoderm and neuroectoderm, forming the anterior pituitary and hypothalamic nuclei that regulate cortisol secretion in a circadian manner. Neuroanatomically, limbic structures (hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex) exert negative feedback on the HPA axis via glucocorticoid receptors, modulating stress responses and mood.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, cortisol secretion peaks in the early morning and nadirs around midnight. In melancholic MDD, hippocampal atrophy and downregulation of glucocorticoid receptors impair negative feedback, resulting in sustained cortisol release into the evening and night (Pariante & Lightman 2008). Elevated nocturnal cortisol disrupts sleep architecture by reducing slow-wave sleep, shortening REM latency, and increasing awakenings. At the molecular level, chronic hypercortisolemia induces glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, reduces brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, and promotes neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, leading to the cognitive and mood symptoms of depression (Duman & Aghajanian 2012). Genetic polymorphisms in FKBP5 and NR3C1 further modulate HPA axis sensitivity and predispose to hypercortisolemia in response to stress (Binder 2009).","clinical_manifestation":"Melancholic MDD typically presents with profound anhedonia, early morning awakening (in over 80% of melancholic patients), diurnal mood variation (worse in the morning), psychomotor retardation or agitation, and significant appetite or weight loss. Cognitive symptoms include impaired concentration and memory. Special populations: geriatric patients may present primarily with apathy and cognitive complaints; pregnant patients show variable HPA axis changes but often maintain hypercortisolemia; immunocompromised individuals may exhibit atypical presentations with predominant somatic symptoms. Without treatment, melancholic depression tends toward chronicity, with relapse rates up to 60% within two years (Kruijshaar et al. 2005). Natural history includes progressive worsening of sleep disturbance and neurocognitive decline if HPA axis remains dysregulated.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on DSM-5 criteria supplemented by clinician-administered scales such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and self-report measures like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Endocrine evaluation for atypical or treatment-resistant cases includes midnight salivary cortisol (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%) or the 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST) (Knorr et al. 2010). Neuroimaging with FDG-PET demonstrates relative prefrontal hypometabolism (positive predictive value ~0.75) but is primarily research-based. Polysomnography is reserved for suspected comorbid sleep disorders. Pre-test probability of MDD in primary care with mood complaints is ~15\u201320%; a PHQ-9 score \u226510 increases post-test probability to >75%.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy for melancholic MDD includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as sertraline or escitalopram (Level A evidence) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) like venlafaxine (Rush et al. 2006). Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) may offer superior efficacy for melancholic features but carry anticholinergic and cardiotoxic risks. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective as monotherapy or in combination (Level B evidence). Chronotherapeutic interventions, including bright light therapy and sleep phase advance, can specifically address early morning awakening. Emerging treatments targeting the HPA axis (e.g., CRF1 receptor antagonists) remain experimental.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up assessments should occur 2\u20134 weeks after treatment initiation to evaluate response and tolerability. Treatment response is defined as \u226550% reduction in HDRS score by 6\u20138 weeks; remission is an HDRS score \u22647. Longevity of therapy: continue antidepressant treatment for at least 6\u20139 months after remission for first-episode MDD, and 1\u20132 years for recurrent cases (APA Guidelines 2010). Monitor for emergent suicidality, especially during the first month. No routine laboratory monitoring is required for SSRIs unless baseline ECG or hepatic/renal impairment exists. Cognitive and quality of life assessments using tools like the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) are recommended every 3\u20136 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early morning awakening is a hallmark of melancholic depression and correlates with HPA axis hyperactivity (mnemonic: \u2018MELAN-CHOLIC\u2019: Mood worst Early morning, Loss of interest, Anhedonia, Neuroendocrine changes...). 2. Midnight salivary cortisol is a noninvasive screening tool for HPA dysregulation with high specificity. 3. Regional prefrontal hypometabolism on FDG-PET supports diagnosis severity but lacks specificity for MDD. 4. Absence of beta activity on EEG suggests alternative diagnoses; normal or increased beta rhythms are typical in depression. 5. Tricyclic antidepressants may be more effective for melancholic features but require ECG monitoring due to QT prolongation risk.","references":"1. American Psychiatric Association.

The family agrees with him. What would you do?","options":["Accept family wishes","Send him to the ethical committee","Insist on medical treatment","Refer him to a psychiatrist"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Refer him to a psychiatrist","subspecialty":"Neuropsychiatry","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Accept family wishes (\u224850 words) is incorrect because consenting to spiritual healing alone delays proven antiepileptic treatment and increases mortality by up to 24% over five years (per ILAE 2017). In rare palliative contexts, respecting cultural beliefs may apply, but generalized tonic-clonic seizures demand medical intervention to prevent SUDEP and status epilepticus.\n\nOption B: Send him to the ethics committee (\u224850 words) is suboptimal for acute refusal. Ethics consultation can help resolve long-term conflicts, yet immediate psychiatric evaluation is faster and more targeted for capacity determination. Ethics referral might be appropriate when legal guardianship disputes arise or capacity remains unclear after psychiatric input.\n\nOption C: Insist on medical treatment (\u224850 words) misjudges capacity. Coercion risks breaching autonomy and may provoke legal issues. While emergent administration can be ethically justified in unconscious status epilepticus, conscious refusal requires capacity assessment. A forcible approach without psychiatric evaluation can violate due process and therapeutic alliance.\n\nOption D: Refer him to a psychiatrist (\u224850 words) is correct because he exhibits possible psychosis or cultural delusions impairing capacity evaluation (per DSM-5 criteria). Psychiatric consultation assesses insight, decision-making capacity, and comorbid mood or psychotic disorders. Up to 30% of refractory epilepsy patients have comorbid psychiatric illness (AAN 2021). Delusional beliefs about devil spirits often reflect temporal lobe involvement.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuroanatomical basis of generalized tonic-clonic seizures involves bilateral cortical networks and thalamocortical loops. Key regions include frontal lobes, motor cortex, supplementary motor area, thalamic intralaminar nuclei, and reticular activating system. Embryologically, the cerebral cortex arises from dorsal telencephalon by week 8, while thalamic nuclei derive from the diencephalon by week 6. Normal regulation depends on inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in cortical layers II\u2013IV and excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal cells in layers V\u2013VI. The balance between cortical excitation and subcortical inhibition prevents runaway hypersynchrony. Related syndromes include absence epilepsy (3 Hz spike-wave) from thalamocortical dysrhythmia and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (4\u20136 Hz polyspike). Historical understanding evolved from Hughlings Jackson\u2019s march of excitation (1861) to modern network theory describing seizure propagation along callosal fibers. Clinically, the precentral gyrus\u2019s homuncular representation predicts tonic extension and clonic jerking distribution. In frontal lobe epilepsy, focal motor signs may masquerade as generalized events. Recognizing key landmarks such as the central sulcus and Rolandic operculum is critical for EEG electrode placement according to the 10\u201320 system.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, generalized tonic-clonic seizures reflect excessive glutamate release activating AMPA and NMDA receptors and decreased GABAergic inhibition via GABAA receptors. Voltage-gated sodium channel mutations (SCN1A, SCN2A) can increase neuronal excitability and are inherited in some familial epilepsy syndromes (autosomal dominant). Cellularly, altered intracellular chloride from mutated KCC2 cotransporters impairs hyperpolarization. Signaling cascades involve mTOR pathway hyperactivity in tuberous sclerosis (TSC1/TSC2 mutations). Inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 facilitate excitotoxicity and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption within 6\u201312 hours post-seizure. Metabolically, neurons shift to anaerobic glycolysis during sustained firing, depleting ATP within minutes and causing Na+/K+-ATPase failure. Pathological network reorganization, or epileptogenesis, occurs over weeks to years after initial insult, with mossy fiber sprouting in hippocampus forming recurrent excitatory circuits. Compensatory upregulation of adenosine and endogenous benzodiazepines eventually fails, leading to chronic seizure recurrence.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset typically begins with aura or prodrome seconds before generalized tonic-clonic onset. The tonic phase (10\u201320 seconds) shows bilateral muscle stiffening, autonomic changes (tachycardia up to 150 bpm, hypertension). Clonic phase (30\u201360 seconds) includes rhythmic jerking at 1\u20132 Hz. Postictal phase lasts minutes to hours with confusion, lethargy, and headache. Neurological exam often reveals Todd\u2019s paralysis lasting up to 36 hours. In pediatrics, seizures may present with hypoxia-induced bradycardia; in elderly, focal onset with rapid generalization is common. Women may have catamenial patterns, with seizure frequency increasing by 30\u201370% perimenstrually. Systemic signs include tongue biting (30% cases), urinary incontinence (25%), and elevated lactate up to 15 mmol/L postictally. Severity scales like the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3) grade episodes from mild to life-threatening. Red flags include status epilepticus (>5 minutes), inability to protect airway, and repeated seizures at <30-minute intervals. Without treatment, natural history involves 60% recurrence within one year and progressive cognitive decline.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Assess capacity with standardized interview and mental status exam (per APA 2018). Step 2: Obtain routine EEG showing generalized spike-wave complexes (sensitivity 75%, specificity 85%) as first-line investigation (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Brain MRI with epilepsy protocol (1.5 T or 3 T, axial FLAIR, coronal T2) to identify structural lesions (83% detection in focal\u2012generalized cases) (according to ILAE 2021 criteria). Step 4: Laboratory studies including CBC, electrolytes (Na 135\u2013145 mEq/L, Ca 8.5\u201310.2 mg/dL), liver and renal function to rule out metabolic triggers (per AAN 2022). Step 5: Lumbar puncture if infection suspected: CSF cell count (0\u20135 cells/\u00b5L), protein (15\u201345 mg/dL), glucose ratio (2:3) (per IDSA 2019). Step 6: Video-EEG monitoring for refractory cases to localize onset and semiology (per ILAE 2020). Step 7: Differential includes syncope (normal EEG), psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (normal ictal EEG), metabolic tremors. Distinguish by clinical context, hyperventilation challenge, and serum prolactin elevation (per Epilepsy Foundation 2022).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Initiate valproate at loading dose 20 mg/kg IV over 15 minutes, then maintenance 10\u201315 mg/kg PO BID (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Tier 1 alternative: Levetiracetam 60 mg/kg loading (max 4500 mg) IV, then 20 mg/kg IV or PO BID (per AAN 2022). Tier 2 (Second-line): If first-line fails, add lamotrigine starting at 0.3 mg/kg PO daily, titrate by 50 mg weekly to 200 mg/day (per EFNS guidelines 2020). Tier 2 adjunct: Topiramate 25 mg PO BID, increase by 25 mg weekly to 200 mg/day (per ILAE 2019). Tier 3 (Third-line): For refractory seizures >2 AED failures, consider ketogenic diet (3:1 ratio, 4:1 for children; 50% responder rate) (per ILAE consensus 2018) or VNS implantation (30\u201350% reduction) (per AAN 2021). Surgical evaluation for focal resection if MRI lesion correlates with EEG (60\u201380% seizure freedom) (per ILAE 2020). Monitor blood counts, LFTs every 3 months and drug levels monthly for phenytoin. Manage side effects: hyperammonemia with carnitine supplementation for valproate. In pregnancy, switch to lamotrigine (per AAN 2021).","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurology follow-up at 2 weeks post-initiation, then monthly until seizure-free for three consecutive months, then every six months (per AAN 2022). Monitor seizure diary frequency, duration, and triggers targeting a 75% reduction within three months. Repeat EEG at 6-month intervals if breakthrough seizures occur (per ILAE 2021). MRI surveillance annually for structural lesions. Assess cognitive function annually using MoCA with target score \u226526. Long-term complications such as osteoporosis in 30% of long-term AED users require DEXA every two years. Prognosis: 1-year seizure freedom in 60%, 5-year in 40% on monotherapy. Initiate occupational and physical therapy by month six to address postictal weakness. Educate on seizure first aid, medication adherence, and SUDEP risk mitigation. Advise driving restrictions: no driving until seizure-free for at least three months (per DMVA guidelines 2019). Provide contacts for Epilepsy Foundation and peer support groups.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always assess capacity: delusional beliefs may indicate impaired decision-making requiring psychiatric referral. 2. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures show diffuse 3\u20135 Hz spike-wave on EEG. 3. First-dose paradox: some AEDs like lamotrigine require slow titration to avoid rash. 4. Catamenial epilepsy affects up to 40% of women; consider cyclic hormone patterns. 5. SUDEP risk increases with \u22653 generalized convulsions per year; stress AED adherence. 6. Mnemonic \u201cSALT\u201d for seizure triggers: Sleep deprivation, Alcohol, Lights (flashing), Temperature changes. 7. Recent guideline change: prioritize levetiracetam over phenytoin in status due to safety profile (AAN 2022). 8. Avoid abrupt AED withdrawal; taper over 2\u20136 months to prevent rebound seizures. 9.
