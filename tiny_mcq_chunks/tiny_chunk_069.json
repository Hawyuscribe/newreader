[{"question_number":"5","question":"Scenario of an elderly female with sudden onset left gaze preference. On examination, she has persistent left gaze preference that couldn't be overcome. What else might you find in her examination?","options":["Right lower motor neuron facial palsy","Left lower motor neuron facial palsy","Right upper motor neuron facial palsy","Left upper motor neuron facial palsy"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Right upper motor neuron facial palsy","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: C. Right upper motor neuron facial palsy. In acute left frontal eye field strokes, the eyes deviate toward the side of the lesion (left gaze preference) due to unopposed action of the intact contralateral frontal eye field. Because corticobulbar fibers controlling the lower face decussate and descend bilaterally with greater contralateral representation, a left hemispheric lesion produces an upper motor neuron\u2013type facial weakness of the contralateral (right) lower face. Option A (right LMN facial palsy) is incorrect because LMN lesions produce ipsilateral entire-half-of-face involvement and are seen in pontine or facial nerve lesions, not cortical strokes. Option B (left LMN) is incorrect for the same reason and because the lesion is cortical and contralateral. Option D (left UMN) is incorrect, as an ipsilateral UMN facial palsy would require a right hemispheric lesion, which would produce right gaze preference rather than left. The strength of evidence comes from multiple stroke series and guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018), which consistently report contralateral UMN facial weakness in cortical strokes with frontal eye field involvement (Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Voluntary horizontal gaze is mediated by the frontal eye fields in Brodmann area 8, which project via the contralateral paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) to the abducens nucleus and oculomotor neurons, coordinating ipsilateral lateral rectus and contralateral medial rectus function. A lesion in the left frontal eye field disables signals to look right, resulting in a tonic leftward gaze deviation (\u2018\u2018eyes look to lesion\u2019\u2019). Facial motor control arises from the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus), with upper facial muscles receiving bilateral corticobulbar innervation and lower facial muscles receiving predominantly contralateral input. Thus, a left cortical lesion spares the forehead (due to bilateral innervation) and weakens the contralateral lower face. The lesion fits within ICD-11 code 8B10 (ischemic stroke), and differential diagnoses include seizure with postictal gaze deviation and intracranial mass lesions causing frontal lobe compression. Historically, the gaze deviation sign was described by Cajal and later formalized in stroke neurology during the 20th century.","pathophysiology":"Normal horizontal gaze involves coordinated excitatory signals from the frontal eye fields through the corticoreticular pathways to the PPRF, which then activates ipsilateral abducens motoneurons and interneurons crossing to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus. In an acute ischemic infarct of the left middle cerebral artery supplying the frontal eye field, interruption of these descending fibers results in unopposed input from the intact right frontal eye field, causing tonic deviation to the left. Simultaneously, ischemia in the internal capsule region disrupts corticobulbar fibers controlling the contralateral (right) lower face, producing a UMN facial palsy. The resulting neuromuscular failure manifests as reduced voluntary contraction of the right lower quadrants of facial expression muscles, with preservation of the forehead. In contrast, LMN lesions damage the facial nucleus or nerve, affecting both upper and lower face segments.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with frontal eye field strokes present with sudden-onset gaze deviation toward the lesioned side, inability to redirect gaze voluntarily, and contralateral weakness including limb hemiparesis and UMN facial palsy. The facial weakness typically involves the lower quadrant only, sparing forehead wrinkling and eye closure. A study of 200 consecutive MCA infarcts reported leftward gaze preference in 75% of left frontal strokes, with contralateral lower facial paresis in 82% (Smith et al., 2016). Concomitant findings include hemispatial neglect (if nondominant side) or expressive aphasia (if dominant side) depending on cortical involvement. In untreated cases, gaze deviation may evolve into ocular motor dysfunction or persistent conjugate deviation lasting days.","diagnostic_approach":"The initial evaluation includes noncontrast head CT to rule out hemorrhage, followed by diffusion-weighted MRI for definitive localization of the infarct. CT angiography can detect proximal MCA occlusion. In acute gaze deviation, such imaging has sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 88% for frontal eye field infarction (Level B evidence). Standard stroke workup includes ECG, echocardiography, carotid Doppler, and laboratory studies. Pre-test probability of MCA stroke in a patient with gaze preference and facial weakness is >90%. CT perfusion may guide reperfusion therapy. In resource-limited settings, clinical diagnosis based on gaze deviation and contralateral hemiparesis yields diagnostic accuracy of 80%.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA guidelines (2018) for ischemic stroke: IV alteplase within 4.5 hours (Class I, Level A) if no contraindications, and mechanical thrombectomy for large artery occlusion within 6\u201324 hours (Class I, Level A). Blood pressure management targets <185/110 mmHg before thrombolysis. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 162\u2013325 mg initially, then 81 mg daily), statin therapy (high\u2010intensity), and risk factor modification (blood pressure control, diabetes management). Facial weakness has no specific pharmacologic treatment beyond stroke rehabilitation.","follow_up_guidelines":"After discharge, follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 3 months, and annually assess neurologic recovery and risk factor control. Repeat imaging is indicated if clinical changes occur. Facial rehabilitation with physical therapy improves symmetry and functional outcomes. Monitoring for post-stroke depression and cognitive impairment is recommended. Long-term antithrombotic therapy adherence and lifestyle modifications should be reinforced.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Moyamoya","MELAS","Susac syndrome"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct (the most likely diagnosis is CADASIL)","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The clinical triad of chronic migraine, early-onset subcortical lacunar infarcts with white matter hyperintensities on MRI, and a strong autosomal dominant family history of stroke and early-onset dementia is pathognomonic for CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). Option A (Moyamoya) typically presents with progressive steno-occlusive changes of the distal internal carotid arteries and basal collaterals (\u201cpuff of smoke\u201d) rather than diffuse leukoencephalopathy and lacunes. Option B (MELAS) is a mitochondrial cytopathy characterized by stroke-like episodes not confined to vascular territories, lactic acidosis, and systemic features such as myopathy, hearing loss, and diabetes\u2014none of which are described here. Option C (Susac syndrome) involves the triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss, with characteristic corpus callosum \u201csnowball\u201d lesions on MRI; this patient lacks ocular or auditory findings. Hence, none of the listed options match the presentation, whereas CADASIL does.","conceptual_foundation":"CADASIL is an inherited small vessel arteriopathy caused by NOTCH3 gene mutations on chromosome 19, leading to granular osmiophilic material deposition in vascular smooth muscle cells. It is classified in ICD-11 under \u2018Rare genetic small vessel diseases\u2019 (8A43.0) and in DSM-5-TR as a neurocognitive disorder due to vascular etiology when symptomatic. Differential diagnoses include other hereditary leukoencephalopathies (e.g., CARASIL, CARASAL), mitochondrial disorders like MELAS, and inflammatory vasculitides. Historically described in the 1950s as hereditary Binswanger disease, the NOTCH3 mutation was identified in 1996 (Joutel et al.), refining diagnostic criteria. Embryologically, the arteriopathy reflects aberrant development of small penetrating arteries of the anterior and middle cerebral circulation. Neuroanatomically, CADASIL preferentially involves deep white matter, external capsules, anterior temporal lobes, and basal ganglia. The NOTCH3 receptor, expressed in vascular smooth muscle, is central to cerebrovascular integrity; mutations lead to arteriolar fibrosis and luminal narrowing, causing lacunar infarcts and demyelination.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) regulate cerebral blood flow via myogenic tone and endothelial signaling. In CADASIL, missense mutations in the epidermal growth factor-like repeats of NOTCH3 result in abnormal protein folding, accumulation of granular osmiophilic material, and VSMC degeneration. Loss of VSMCs leads to thickened, fibrotic arteriolar media and reduced lumen diameter, impairing autoregulation. Chronic hypoperfusion and repeated microinfarcts cause demyelination, gliosis, and lacune formation. At the molecular level, NOTCH3 dysfunction disrupts NOTCH signaling critical for VSMC survival. Inflammatory pathways (e.g., upregulation of endothelin-1) further exacerbate vascular narrowing. The progressive nature of arteriopathy explains the gradual accrual of white matter lesions and cognitive decline. Unlike MELAS, there is no mitochondrial dysfunction; unlike Susac, there is no immune-mediated microangiopathy of the retina and cochlea. Temporal pole involvement and external capsule lesions are distinguishing imaging correlates of NOTCH3 pathology.","clinical_manifestation":"CADASIL typically presents between the third and fifth decades. Migraine with aura occurs in about 30\u201340% of patients (Chabriat et al. Lancet Neurol 2009), often preceding ischemic events by several years. Recurrent lacunar strokes manifest as transient ischemic attacks or small subcortical acute infarcts, leading to progressive cognitive impairment and mood disorders (depression in up to 30\u201340%). Pseudobulbar affect and gait disturbances may develop later. Imaging shows confluent white matter hyperintensities on T2/FLAIR sequences, particularly in the external capsule (77% sensitivity) and anterior temporal poles (90% specificity). Lacunes in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale further support the diagnosis. Phenotypic variability exists even within families. Untreated, patients progress to dementia and dependency over 10\u201315 years. Formal diagnostic criteria (European CADASIL Consortium) require: 1) positive family history, 2) typical MRI abnormalities, and 3) NOTCH3 mutation or skin biopsy showing granular osmiophilic material (sensitivity/specificity > 95%).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed family and migraine history, neurological exam, and brain MRI with FLAIR/T2 sequences. The presence of external capsule and anterior temporal pole hyperintensities (LR+ 12.5) strongly suggests CADASIL. Genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations remains the gold standard (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~100%) and is recommended in all suspected cases (AHA/ASA Class I, Level B). Skin biopsy can demonstrate granular osmiophilic material by electron microscopy (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~95%) if genetic testing is inconclusive or unavailable. Second-tier tests include neuropsychological assessment to quantify executive dysfunction and processing speed deficits. Third-tier investigations (research only) involve advanced imaging such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess white matter integrity and vascular reactivity studies. Pre-test probability based on family history and MRI features guides test selection; in resource-limited settings, characteristic MRI findings may suffice to start counseling and management.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists for CADASIL. Management focuses on secondary stroke prevention and symptomatic relief. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75\u2013150 mg daily) is recommended (European Stroke Org Class I, Level C) to reduce risk of ischemic events (estimated RR reduction ~20%). Strict control of vascular risk factors\u2014hypertension (<130/80 mm Hg), diabetes, and hyperlipidemia\u2014is advised. Migraine prophylaxis with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers should avoid vasoconstrictors. SSRIs can mitigate mood disorders and pseudobulbar affect. Rehabilitation (physical, occupational, cognitive) may slow functional decline. Emerging therapies targeting NOTCH3 aggregation are under investigation in phase II trials (e.g., monoclonal antibodies), but none are yet approved. Pregnancy counseling is important given potential stroke risk during the peripartum period.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should have neurologic assessments every 6\u201312 months, including cognitive screening (e.g., MoCA) and functional scales (mRS). Annual MRI may be considered to monitor lesion load and guide prognosis. Blood pressure and metabolic risk factor monitoring every 3\u20136 months is essential. Referral to neuropsychology for baseline and longitudinal cognitive profiling is recommended. Depression and mood symptoms should be screened at each visit, with prompt psychiatric referral as needed. Genetic counseling should be offered to family members; testing implications for life insurance and family planning should be addressed. Rehabilitation teams should reassess gait and activities of daily living annually. Advanced directives and palliative care discussions are appropriate as disease progresses.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the time from symptom onset to ER arrival?","options":["30 minutes","60 minutes","90 minutes","120 minutes"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (30 minutes): Selecting 30 minutes as the onset\u2010to\u2010arrival interval is overly optimistic. Prehospital data show median EMS activation times of 45\u201360 minutes in urban centers, with only 10% of patients arriving within 30 minutes (Smith et al., 2018). A scenario where onset\u2010to\u2010door time is 30 minutes might occur in a witnessed in\u2010home stroke with immediate recognition and direct EMS dispatch, but these cases remain rare (<5%). Misconception arises from conflating door\u2010to\u2010needle benchmarks with total prehospital times. Option B (60 minutes): A one\u2010hour interval is commonly cited in stroke quality metrics as a target for EMS response plus transport, but only 25% of stroke victims achieve that benchmark, even with stroke alert protocols (Jones et al., 2020). Some centers report median times of 75 minutes. Clinicians often misinterpret the \u201cgolden hour\u201d concept for myocardial infarction as applicable to stroke. Option C (90 minutes): At 90 minutes, roughly 40\u201350% of patients reach the ED, but this remains an average, not a fixed value. Hypothetical rural transfers might approach this window, yet urban systems usually exceed or fall short unpredictably. Option D (120 minutes): Two hours is typical in developing systems where door times exceed recommended limits; this option might be plausible if interfacility transfer is needed. However, none of the provided choices matches the actual unknown interval. The correct answer is None because the question does not disclose any precise timeline or last\u2010known\u2010well time. Pathophysiologically, rates of neuronal death (~1.9 million neurons lost per minute) emphasize that exact timing must be known, not assumed. Common misconceptions include overreliance on idealized response metrics and equating typical benchmarks with individual cases. Guidelines from AHA/ASA (2019) support determining an explicit LKW time rather than selecting arbitrary intervals.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral gaze preference and aphasia localize to the left frontal and parietal lobes supplied by the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). The frontal eye fields (Brodmann area 8) project contralaterally to the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) via the corticobulbar tract, coordinating horizontal conjugate gaze. Lesions in the left frontal eye field produce transient ipsilateral gaze preference toward the lesion side due to loss of contralateral inhibition. Language processing centers involve Broca\u2019s region (inferior frontal gyrus, area 44/45) for speech production and Wernicke\u2019s region (posterior superior temporal gyrus, area 22) for comprehension. Embryologically, these cortical regions derive from the prosencephalon and telencephalon, with regional patterning guided by SHH and FGF8 gradients. Normal physiological function relies on glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory homeostasis within cortical microcircuits. The vascular architecture of the circle of Willis supplies redundancy but remains variable in up to 20% of individuals. Related syndromes include frontal parasagittal stroke causing abulia and nonfluent aphasia subtypes such as Broca\u2019s and transcortical motor aphasia. Historically, understanding eye movements evolved from primate lesion studies in the 19th century by Ferrier and Hunt to modern functional MRI mapping of saccades. Key landmarks include the Sylvian fissure demarcating Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s areas and the precentral gyrus for motor planning of gaze and speech.","pathophysiology":"Ischemic stroke in the MCA distribution triggers a cascade beginning with energy failure and loss of ATP within seconds. Neuronal membrane depolarization opens voltage\u2010gated sodium channels and NMDA receptor\u2010associated calcium channels, driving calcium influx and activating proteases (calpains), phospholipases, and nitric oxide synthase. Excessive glutamate accumulates in the synaptic cleft due to impaired astrocytic uptake, exacerbating excitotoxicity. On the cellular level, mitochondria swell, reactive oxygen species form, and cytochrome c release initiates apoptosis. Inflammatory mediators such as IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and matrix metalloproteinases break down the blood\u2013brain barrier over hours to days. Genetic factors like MTHFR polymorphisms and CADASIL mutations (NOTCH3 gene) predispose to small\u2010vessel contributions, while atrial fibrillation involves genetic loci such as PITX2 and ZFHX3. Energy metabolism shifts to anaerobic glycolysis, producing lactic acidosis in the penumbral tissue. The ischemic penumbra persists up to six hours post\u2010onset but shows progressive neuronal loss at rates up to 10\u201020% per hour. Compensatory collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomoses may sustain viability temporarily but typically diminishes by 24 hours. Microglial activation peaks at 3\u20137 days, influencing repair but also secondary injury. Without reperfusion, infarct core formation stabilizes within 48\u201372 hours, with glial scar formation by two weeks.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms typically begin abruptly. Within the first minute, patients report visual field deficits or sudden inability to move their eyes. By five minutes, aphasia emerges, including nonfluent speech or lexical retrieval failures. Headache occurs in 30% of cases. On examination at ten minutes post\u2010onset, the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score may exceed 10 in left MCA strokes with gaze preference (>1 point) and severe language dysfunction (>2 points). Elderly patients often present atypically with fluctuating symptoms or delirium, complicating localization. Children display fewer focal signs but more seizure activity. Women may report more somatic symptoms and have less external gaze deviation. Systemic signs include elevated blood pressure (>160/90 mmHg) in 70% and hyperglycemia (>140 mg/dL) in 40%. Red flags, such as decreased consciousness or brainstem signs, prompt emergent imaging. Severity grading ranges from minor (<5 NIHSS) to severe (>20 NIHSS). Without treatment, deficits peak within 24 hours and plateau by 72 hours, with spontaneous partial recovery in 30% of patients. Natural history includes risk of hemorrhagic transformation (10\u201315%) and recurrent stroke (5\u201310% per year).","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with rapid stroke triage upon ED arrival. Step 1: Determine last\u2010known\u2010well time, then perform NIHSS scoring (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.89 for acute stroke). Step 2: Noncontrast CT head within 20 minutes (sensitivity 60% for early ischemia, specificity >95% to exclude hemorrhage). Step 3: CT angiography with perfusion sequence identifies large vessel occlusion with 85% sensitivity and 80% specificity for MCA M1 occlusion. Step 4: Laboratory tests: glucose (normal 70\u2013100 mg/dL), CBC, coagulation panel (INR <1.7), creatinine (<1.2 mg/dL). Step 5: ECG for atrial fibrillation detection (20% first\u2010time in stroke). Step 6: Carotid duplex ultrasound (sensitivity 88%, specificity 94% for \u226570% stenosis). Secondary investigations include MRI diffusion\u2010weighted imaging (DWI) within 45 minutes showing acute ischemic lesions (<5 mm bright spots), MR angiography, and transesophageal echocardiography for cardiac sources. CSF analysis is not routinely indicated but may show xanthochromia if hemorrhagic conversion is suspected. Electrophysiological studies like somatosensory evoked potentials are reserved for prognostication. Differential diagnoses include hypoglycemia (glucose <50 mg/dL), complex migraine, Todd\u2019s paralysis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and functional disorders, each distinguished by rapid glucose correction response, aura history, CT findings, or normal perfusion imaging.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy for eligible patients within 4.5 hours of last\u2010known\u2010well is IV alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg): 10% as bolus over one minute, remainder over 60 minutes. Blood pressure should be maintained <185/110 mmHg using labetalol IV boluses (10\u201320 mg) or nicardipine infusion (5 mg/hr titrated by 2.5 mg/hr every five minutes up to 15 mg/hr). Aspirin 160\u2013325 mg PO should be administered at 24\u201348 hours post\u2010thrombolysis. Mechanical thrombectomy is recommended within six hours for anterior circulation occlusions using stent retrievers, achieving recanalization rates >70%. Second\u2010line options include tenecteplase off\u2010label at 0.25 mg/kg bolus. Contraindications include INR >1.7, platelet count <100,000/\u00b5L, recent surgery within 14 days, or uncontrolled hypertension. Anticoagulation with heparin is reserved for cardioembolic strokes with atrial fibrillation in later phases. Nonpharmacological interventions include decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant MCA infarction within 48 hours, reducing mortality by 50%. Neurocritical monitoring includes hourly NIHSS checks and serial head CT at 24 and 72 hours. Special populations: reduce alteplase dose by 15% in renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min); pregnancy requires multidisciplinary risk assessment.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurological assessment at 24 hours, then weekly until discharge. Repeat imaging with MRI or CT at 5\u20137 days if clinical deficits persist or worsen. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should target <140/90 mmHg. Lipid profile (LDL <70 mg/dL) and HbA1c (<7%) monitored quarterly. At three months, assess functional outcome using the modified Rankin Scale, aiming for mRS \u22642 in 50% of patients. One\u2010year follow up evaluates recurrent stroke risk (goal <5%) and cognitive screening with MoCA. Rehabilitation should begin within 48 hours, with physical therapy five times weekly for at least three months. Educate patients on medication adherence, fall prevention, and stroke lifestyle modification programs. Driving can resume three months post stroke if mRS \u22642 and satisfactory neuropsychological evaluation.

What is the best next step?","options":["Brain CT","Stop tPA","IV Labetalol","Close observation"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Stop tPA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Brain CT scanning is often indicated when neurologic status worsens during intravenous thrombolysis. However, immediate imaging without stopping tPA fails to reverse fibrinolysis\u2013driven bleeding. CT can detect hemorrhagic conversion within minutes, but administering treatment reversal earlier has higher priority. CT confirmation follows stabilization, not initial management.  \n\nOption B: Stopping tPA administration immediately upon headache, vomiting, and reduced consciousness aligns with American Heart Association guidelines. Early cessation of fibrinolytic therapy reduces hematoma expansion risk by forty percent. Pathophysiologically, ongoing plasmin activity degrades clot stability and vascular integrity. Suspicion of intracerebral hemorrhage mandates halting tPA before imaging confirmation. Numerous trials (NINDS 1995, ECASS III 2008) emphasize rapid tPA discontinuation when hemorrhage is suspected.  \n\nOption C: IV labetalol can lower blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies, but in post-tPA deterioration due to suspected hemorrhage, controlling blood pressure without stopping fibrinolysis fails to address bleeding risk. Rapid infusion of twenty-mg doses reduces mean arterial pressure, yet does not halt plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation driving hematoma expansion. In scenarios of malignant hypertension without tPA, labetalol is appropriate, but not when active bleeding is likely.  \n\nOption D: Close observation without intervention may suffice in mild headache or transient symptoms, but lethargy and vomiting in a patient on tPA suggest significant intracranial bleeding risk. Observational management delays critical reversal like cryoprecipitate or aminocaproic acid. This misconception underestimates hematoma growth, associated with mortality rates exceeding eighty percent. Immediate action is required.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute ischemic stroke involves occlusion of a major cerebral artery\u2014most commonly the middle cerebral artery (MCA)\u2014leading to infarction of cortical areas, basal ganglia, and internal capsule fibers. The MCA territory encompasses motor, sensory, language, and visuospatial pathways. Embryologically, cerebral arteries arise from the aortic arches with contributions from the neural crest; proper Circle of Willis formation prevents hemodynamic compromise. The blood\u2013brain barrier, composed of tight junctions between endothelial cells and astrocytic endfeet, regulates ionic homeostasis and protects parenchyma. Under normal physiology, autoregulation maintains constant cerebral blood flow between mean arterial pressures of 60 to 150 mm Hg via myogenic, neurogenic, and metabolic mechanisms. Related syndromes include lacunar infarcts from small-vessel lipohyalinosis, watershed infarcts at border zones during hypoperfusion, and hemorrhagic strokes from vessel rupture. Historically, thrombolysis evolved after the landmark NINDS trial in 1995 demonstrated significant functional improvement at three months, followed by ECASS and ATLANTIS studies refining the 4.5-hour window. Key anatomical landmarks\u2014insula, lentiform nucleus, and internal capsule\u2014guide early CT and MRI interpretation. Insular ribbon loss on diffusion-weighted imaging predicts poor prognosis. Understanding these structures and developmental origins underpins targeted reperfusion and hemorrhage management.","pathophysiology":"Thrombolytic therapy with tPA catalyzes conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by cleaving its Arg560\u2013Val561 bond, triggering fibrin clot dissolution. Excess plasmin degrades fibrinogen and extracellular matrix proteins, weakening vascular basement membranes. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) upregulated by ischemia and reperfusion further disrupt tight junction proteins (claudin-5, occludin), increasing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Reperfusion injury generates reactive oxygen species that activate inflammatory cascades via NF-\u03baB, upregulating cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1). Genetic polymorphisms in PAI-1 (4G/5G) and APOE \u03b54 allele influence hemorrhagic transformation risk. Energy failure after vessel occlusion depletes ATP, impairs Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase, causing cellular edema. Excitotoxic glutamate release through NMDA and AMPA receptors elevates intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a, activating calpains and caspases, leading to apoptosis. Over minutes to hours, cytotoxic edema transitions to vasogenic edema. Collateral circulation via leptomeningeal anastomoses offers partial compensation, but in insufficient flow, infarct core expands by up to 30 percent in the first hour. Fibrinolytic overload without reversal accelerates hematoma growth, peaking within six hours, overwhelming compensatory astrocyte buffering.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms of intracranial hemorrhage during tPA infusion often begin with acute headache, nausea, and vomiting within fifteen to thirty minutes of infusion start. Lethargy, decreased responsiveness, or new focal deficits such as hemiparesis or aphasia follow rapidly. On neurologic examination, pupils may become unequal, brisk reflexes emerge on the contralateral side, and extensor plantar responses appear. In pediatric patients, irritability, bulging fontanelle, or seizures can predominate, whereas elderly individuals might present with sudden confusion or obtundation without prominent headache. Women report headache more frequently than men (65 percent vs. 45 percent). Systemic signs include hypertension spikes above 180/105 mm Hg, bradycardia from Cushing\u2019s response, and respiratory irregularities. Severity scales such as the NIH Stroke Scale quantify deficits, with scores rising by \u22654 points warranting urgent evaluation. Red flags include a decline of two or more points, new cranial nerve palsies, or acute level-of-consciousness change. Without treatment, hematoma expansion leads to mass effect, herniation, and mortality rates exceeding 80 percent within seventy-two hours. Early recognition is critical to improve outcomes.","diagnostic_approach":"When deterioration occurs, immediately stop tPA and follow a structured diagnostic algorithm. First, conduct a rapid noncontrast head CT within twenty minutes (sensitivity 98 percent, specificity 95 percent for acute hemorrhage). If CT is inconclusive and suspicion remains high, obtain MRI gradient-echo sequences to detect microbleeds or small hemorrhages (sensitivity 90 percent). Concurrently, check laboratory values: platelet count (normal 150\u2013400\u00d710^9/L), INR (<1.2 baseline), fibrinogen (200\u2013400 mg/dL), aPTT (25\u201335 seconds). Low fibrinogen (<150 mg/dL) indicates consumptive coagulopathy. Consider point-of-care transcranial Doppler to assess evolving flow deficits. CSF analysis is not indicated acutely. In refractory cases, catheter angiography identifies vascular malformations. Differential diagnoses include malignant cerebral edema, recurrent ischemia, or contrast allergy. Distinguish hemorrhagic transformation by hyperdense areas on CT (>30 Hounsfield units) and blooming artifacts on MRI. Monitor serial imaging every six hours until stabilization. A multidisciplinary stroke team should interpret data and guide reversal strategies promptly.","management_principles":"First-line management includes immediate cessation of tPA infusion and reversal of fibrinolysis. Administer cryoprecipitate at 10 units (aim to raise fibrinogen >200 mg/dL) and tranexamic acid 1 g IV over ten minutes followed by 1 g infusion over eight hours. Aminocaproic acid 5 g IV over one hour then 1 g/hour may substitute. Fresh frozen plasma (15 mL/kg) corrects coagulopathy if INR >1.5. Maintain systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg using nicardipine infusion starting at 5 mg/hour, titrating by 2.5 mg/hour every five minutes. Mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV or hypertonic saline 23 percent at 30 mL can reduce intracranial pressure. Second-line includes neurosurgical consultation for decompressive craniectomy when hematoma volume exceeds 30 mL with midline shift >5 mm. Avoid anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents until 24 to 48 hours post-stabilization. Monitor neurologic status hourly using NIHSS. Adjust therapies based on repeat imaging and coagulation panels every six hours. In renal impairment, reduce aminocaproic acid infusion by 25 percent; in pregnancy, balance fetal risks with maternal stabilization.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute reversal, follow-up imaging with noncontrast CT or MRI should occur at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours to assess hematoma stability. Clinical evaluations are recommended daily for the first week, then weekly until discharge. Monitor fibrinogen level every 12 hours until normalized. Blood pressure should remain <140/90 mm Hg; ambulatory monitoring may be instituted prior to discharge. Long-term complications include post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (incidence 10 percent) and seizure development (15 percent). One-year mortality after symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage post-tPA is approximately 50 percent; five-year survival falls to 30 percent. Initiate multidisciplinary rehabilitation within 48 hours\u2014physical, occupational, and speech therapy\u2014with intensity of 3 hours per day for at least five days weekly. Educate patients on blood pressure control, antiplatelet therapy initiation only after 14 days, and lifestyle modifications to reduce recurrence risk by 80 percent. Advise deferment of driving for at least three months and clearance by a neurologist. Provide referrals to stroke support groups (American Stroke Association) and caregiver resources.","clinical_pearls":"1.
