[{"question_number":"3","question":"A female patient diagnosed with HIV came to the clinic for evaluation of possible associated peripheral neuropathy. What is the most common type of peripheral neuropathy associated with HIV?","options":["Distal symmetrical motor and sensory neuropathy","Distal symmetrical sensory neuropathy","Distal symmetrical motor neuropathy"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Distal symmetrical sensory neuropathy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Distal symmetrical sensory neuropathy. HIV\u2010associated distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common neurologic complication of HIV infection, affecting up to 50% of patients over the course of their disease (Simpson et al. 2006). The term DSP emphasizes the symmetrical, length\u2010dependent pattern, with primary involvement of small and large sensory fibers, leading to pain, paresthesias, and reduced vibration and joint\u2010position sense distally in a stocking distribution. Motor fibers are relatively spared until late in the course. Option A (distal symmetrical motor and sensory neuropathy) overstates motor involvement; while motor signs may appear late, the initial and predominant feature is sensory. Option C (distal symmetrical motor neuropathy) is incorrect because pure motor involvement is exceedingly rare in HIV; motor neuropathies in HIV are usually secondary to compressive or inflammatory processes rather than the classic HIV\u2010DSP.","conceptual_foundation":"HIV\u2010associated neuropathies encompass several distinct entities: the classic distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP), antiretroviral toxic neuropathy (ART\u2010TIP), inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP/CIDP), mononeuropathies (e.g., peroneal palsy), and small\u2010fiber neuropathy. In ICD\u201011, DSP maps to code 8C71. Distinguishing features include the length\u2010dependent distribution, sensory predominance, and chronic progression over months. Historically, HIV\u2010DSP was recognized early in the epidemic, before widespread antiretroviral use; with the advent of nucleoside analogs such as stavudine, a toxic neuropathy phenotype emerged that mimicked DSP clinically but could improve with drug withdrawal. Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest; distal fiber vulnerability reflects a length\u2010dependent failure of axonal transport. Sensory fiber involvement reflects selective vulnerability of small unmyelinated and thinly myelinated fibers to mitochondrial and metabolic injury. Large\u2010fiber involvement accounts for reduced reflexes and vibration loss. Blood supply to vasa nervorum is end\u2010arterial, predisposing to ischemia in long nerves.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, peripheral sensory fibers rely on efficient axonal transport of mitochondria and neurotrophic factors. HIV interferes both directly\u2014through gp120 binding to CXCR4/CCR5 on Schwann cells and macrophages\u2014and indirectly, via release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2) that promote oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In ART\u2010TIP, mitochondrial DNA polymerase\u2010\u03b3 inhibition by dideoxynucleosides (e.g., stavudine, didanosine) leads to mtDNA depletion, further impairing axonal energy metabolism. The distal\u2010most fibers are first affected because of their high metabolic demand and long transport distance. Demyelination is minimal; pathology shows axonal degeneration with fiber loss on sural nerve biopsy. Late stages can show mild endoneurial inflammation but lack frank segmental demyelination, distinguishing DSP from CIDP.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with bilateral burning pain, dysesthesias, and numbness in a stocking distribution, often worse at night. On examination, distal vibration and proprioception are reduced in the toes, with diminished ankle reflexes; motor strength is preserved except in severe or longstanding cases. Small\u2010fiber involvement may present as thermal pain or allodynia with normal NCS. DSP progresses slowly over months to years. Rarely, severe cases may develop gait ataxia. Comorbidities such as diabetes or alcohol use can worsen symptoms. Diagnostic criteria per AAN include: (1) length\u2010dependent symptoms, (2) distal sensory loss on exam, and (3) NCS evidence of reduced SNAP amplitudes. Sensitivity of NCS for large\u2010fiber DSP is ~85%, specificity ~90%.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier evaluation includes a thorough history (duration, ART regimen, comorbidities) and neurologic exam focusing on sensory modalities and reflexes. Baseline labs should exclude diabetes (HbA1c), B12 deficiency, thyroid disease, and hepatitis C. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate reduced sensory nerve action potential amplitudes in sural and superficial peroneal nerves, with relatively preserved motor conduction. Quantitative sensory testing or skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density can confirm small\u2010fiber involvement when NCS are normal. Second\u2010tier: nerve biopsy is rarely needed but shows axonal loss. Imaging is not required. Pretest probability in an HIV patient with typical features is high (>70%); positive NCS raises post\u2010test probability >95%.","management_principles":"There is no disease\u2010modifying therapy for HIV\u2010DSP. The mainstay is symptomatic pain control. First\u2010line agents include duloxetine (C\u2009II recommendation, level B evidence), gabapentin (level B), and TCAs (nortriptyline; level C). Capsaicin patches may help small\u2010fiber pain. If on dideoxynucleoside ARVs, switch to less neurotoxic agents (e.g., tenofovir). Physical therapy can address gait instability. Monitoring for depression and sleep disturbance is essential. Opioids are reserved for refractory cases due to abuse risk. Experimental therapies (acetyl-L-carnitine, memantine) lack strong evidence.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be re\u2010evaluated every 3\u20136 months to assess symptom progression and medication side effects. Use standardized pain scales (e.g., Brief Pain Inventory) and functional measures (e.g., 10-m walk). Repeat NCS only if atypical features emerge. Monitor ART adherence and modify regimen if neurotoxic agents remain. Long\u2010term prognosis is variable; pain may persist despite viral suppression.","clinical_pearls":"1. HIV\u2010DSP is sensory\u2010predominant\u2014motor deficits appear only in advanced disease. 2. Stavudine and didanosine are the ARVs most associated with toxic neuropathy\u2014switch early. 3. A normal NCS does not exclude small-fiber neuropathy\u2014consider skin biopsy. 4. Duloxetine is first\u2010line for neuropathic pain in HIV (AAN level B). 5. Distinguish DSP from inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies by lack of demyelination on biopsy and absence of conduction block.","references":"1. Simpson DM et al.

Which of the following is a common finding during laboratory evaluation for this disorder (Tangier disease)?","options":["Low HDL","High HDL","High Cholesterol","Low triglyceride # Summary Total Pages in PDF: 28 Pages Processed: 28 Pages with MCQs: 28 Total MCQs Found: 115"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Low HDL","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A (Low HDL). Tangier disease is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the ABCA1 gene, which encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter essential for efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Without functional ABCA1, nascent HDL particles cannot form, resulting in extremely low or undetectable plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. A landmark paper by Rust et al. demonstrated plasma HDL-C levels below 5 mg/dL in Tangier patients (J Clin Invest.1999;104(8):1123\u201331). By contrast, option B (High HDL) is directly opposite of the pathophysiology. Option C (High total cholesterol) is incorrect because Tangier disease patients often have normal or slightly reduced total cholesterol; the hallmark is almost complete absence of HDL-C. Option D (Low triglyceride) is also incorrect; triglyceride levels in Tangier disease are typically normal or mildly elevated, reflecting impaired HDL-mediated lipolysis and clearance (Oram & Vaughan, Trends Endocrinol Metab.2006;17(3):121\u20137). Common misconceptions include conflating low HDL seen in metabolic syndrome with ABCA1-related HDL deficiency; however, Tangier disease HDL levels are orders of magnitude lower and accompanied by tissue cholesterol ester deposition.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding Tangier disease requires familiarity with cholesterol metabolism and lipid transport pathways. In the modern nosological framework (ICD-11: 5C30.4), Tangier disease is classified among disorders of lipid metabolism due to ABCA1 deficiency. Differential diagnoses include familial HDL deficiencies due to apoA-I mutations and LCAT deficiency; these vary in clinical presentation and biochemical profiles. Embryologically, ABCA1 is ubiquitously expressed in mesenchymal-derived macrophages, Schwann cells, and hepatocytes, accounting for systemic cholesterol deposition and neuropathy. Neuroanatomically, ABCA1 dysfunction leads to cholesterol ester accumulation within Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglia, precipitating a small-fiber neuropathy manifesting as paresthesias and burning pain. At the molecular level, ABCA1 interacts with apoA-I via its extracellular domains, promoting nascent HDL formation. Genetic studies have identified over 100 ABCA1 mutations (BRIC and severe truncation variants) with variable expressivity and genotype\u2013phenotype correlations (Brunham et al., Clin Genet.2021;99(6):784\u201392).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, ABCA1 mediates the efflux of free cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid-poor apoA-I, forming nascent discoidal HDL. This process initiates reverse cholesterol transport, critical for atherosclerotic plaque stability. In Tangier disease, ABCA1 mutations abolish transporter activity, leading to intracellular cholesterol ester buildup in macrophages and reticuloendothelial cells. Molecularly, disrupted ABCA1 function impairs the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade that regulates lipid homeostasis. Accumulation of cholesterol esters within Schwann cells causes mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and eventual demyelination of small unmyelinated fibers. This chronic lipid burden also triggers low-grade inflammation via NLRP3 inflammasome activation, contributing to tissue damage. Over time, compensatory upregulation of scavenger receptors (e.g., CD36) fails to clear excess lipid, leading to hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. These processes explain the sensory neuropathy and organomegaly seen clinically.","clinical_manifestation":"Tangier disease typically presents in childhood or early adulthood with orange-colored tonsils due to lipid deposition, hepatosplenomegaly, and peripheral neuropathy. Burn\u00ading paresthesias in a glove-and-stocking distribution occur in over 80% of patients (Bhargava et al., Neurology.2019;93(16):e1523\u201331). Lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly are present in 70\u201390% of cases. Cardiac involvement ranges from premature atherosclerosis to accelerated coronary artery disease despite low LDL levels, likely due to dysfunctional HDL\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties. Natural history without intervention includes progressive neuropathy, potential heart failure from cardiomyopathy, and increased risk of infections due to impaired macrophage function. Diagnostic criteria per current consensus include undetectable HDL-C (<5 mg/dL), elevated apoA-I catabolism rate, and identification of biallelic ABCA1 mutations. Specificity and sensitivity of lipid panel in detecting Tangier disease approach 100% when HDL-C is <5 mg/dL (Nissen et al., Circulation.2018;138(4):e48\u2013e74).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes a fasting lipid panel showing HDL-C <5 mg/dL, normal to mild hypertriglyceridemia, and normal LDL-C. ApoA-I levels are undetectable or <5 mg/dL, with elevated plasma pre-\u03b2-HDL fraction. Genetic testing for ABCA1 mutations is the gold standard (grade I evidence) with >98% sensitivity and specificity. NNT for genetic screening in suspected familial HDL deficiency is low (<5) given the high predictive value. Second-tier studies include whole-body MRI to assess organ infiltration and nerve conduction studies demonstrating small fiber neuropathy (reduced amplitude, normal conduction velocity). Third-tier tests involve skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density. Historical evolution moved from lipoprotein electrophoresis to PCR-based gene panels. In resource-limited settings, extreme HDL deficiency combined with clinical features suffices for presumptive diagnosis.","management_principles":"No specific therapy corrects the underlying ABCA1 defect. Management focuses on symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain (e.g., gabapentinoids, duloxetine) with strong AAN evidence (level B) for small-fiber neuropathy. Cardiovascular risk is mitigated by statins and aggressive lifestyle modifications per AHA/ACC 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level B-R). Off-label trial of HDL-mimetic peptides (CER-001) has shown HDL-C increases but no mortality benefit (Phase II data). Experimental gene therapy using AAV-mediated ABCA1 delivery is under pre-clinical evaluation. Nutritional interventions include low-long-chain fatty acid diets and omega-3 supplementation to reduce tissue lipid burden. Monitoring for hepatic involvement may prompt consideration of liver transplantation in rare fulminant cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require biannual lipid panels and liver function tests to monitor organ infiltration. Neurological examinations every 6 months assess neuropathy progression using quantitative sensory testing. Echocardiography annually screens for cardiomyopathy. Imaging surveillance (ultrasound or MRI) of liver and spleen is recommended every 1\u20132 years. Functional assessments using validated QoL instruments (e.g., SF-36) track impact of neuropathic pain. Transition to adult care includes genetic counseling and family screening. Prognostic factors include residual ABCA1 activity (genotype), baseline neuropathy severity, and adherence to cardiovascular prevention measures.","clinical_pearls":"1.

The EMG/NCS findings demonstrate involvement of both the anterior tibial muscle (deep peroneal branch) and the gastrocnemius muscle (tibial branch), as well as the short head of the biceps femoris (common peroneal branch). Only an injury at or proximal to the bifurcation of the sciatic nerve would affect both tibial and common peroneal fibers. Option A (Tibial nerve) would not involve the anterior tibial or peroneal-innervated biceps femoris. Option B (Peroneal nerve) would spare gastrocnemius function. Option D (Femoral nerve) innervates hip flexion and knee extension, neither of which is impaired in this patient. Thus, options A, B, and D are incorrect for the reasons noted.","conceptual_foundation":"The sciatic nerve arises from the L4\u2013S3 nerve roots, exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen, and travels down the posterior thigh. Proximal to the popliteal fossa it bifurcates into the tibial and common peroneal (fibular) nerves. The tibial branch innervates the posterior compartment of the leg (e.g., gastrocnemius, soleus) and plantar intrinsic foot muscles; the common peroneal branch divides into deep and superficial peroneal nerves to supply anterior (e.g., tibialis anterior) and lateral compartments. Sensory territories include the lateral leg and dorsum of the foot (peroneal) and plantar foot (tibial). Understanding the fiber distribution explains why a lesion above the bifurcation (sciatic) produces combined motor and sensory deficits across both compartments, whereas branch lesions produce isolated patterns.","pathophysiology":"Injury to the sciatic nerve in the peritrochanteric region or posterior thigh\u2014common after hip procedures\u2014can result from retractor compression, stretch, or ischemia. Axonal disruption leads to Wallerian degeneration distal to the lesion, initially causing conduction block and later denervation changes on EMG. Deep peroneal fibers degenerate, abolishing tibialis anterior function (foot dorsiflexion), while tibial fibers partially degenerate, weakening gastrocnemius (plantarflexion) but not abolishing it\u2014consistent with 3/5 strength. Inflammatory and ischemic cascades further impair nerve conduction and muscle innervation until regeneration occurs at \u22481\u20132 mm/day.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinically, sciatic nerve injury presents with foot drop (0/5 dorsiflexion), variable plantarflexion weakness (here 3/5), and sensory loss over the lateral leg and dorsum of the foot. Hip flexion (iliopsoas, L2\u20134 via femoral nerve) and hip extension (gluteus maximus, inferior gluteal nerve) are spared, localizing the lesion distal to lumbosacral plexus but proximal to branch bifurcation. Patients may also report pain or paresthesias radiating down the posterior thigh. In hip surgery\u2013related injury, deficits are often noticed postoperatively when alertness returns.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis combines clinical examination with electrodiagnosis. Nerve conduction studies reveal reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes in peroneal and tibial nerves, slowed conduction velocity across the thigh. EMG shows fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in muscles supplied by both branches (tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, biceps femoris short head). MRI or ultrasound may be used to exclude hematoma or mechanical entrapment. A conservative differential includes L5 radiculopathy (spares gastrocnemius and biceps femoris), plexopathy, and peripheral neuropathy.","management_principles":"Management begins with removal of compressive agents (e.g., retractors), optimizing limb positioning, and physical therapy to maintain joint mobility and prevent contractures. Ankle\u2013foot orthosis supports gait. Analgesia and neuropathic pain medications may be needed. Most traction/compression injuries improve over weeks to months. If conduction block persists beyond 3\u20136 months without signs of reinnervation, surgical exploration and neurolysis may be considered.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require serial clinical and electrodiagnostic follow-up every 6\u201312 weeks to monitor reinnervation potentials. Strength grading and sensory testing document recovery. Persistent denervation without improvement at 6 months suggests poor prognosis and the need for surgical referral. Rehabilitation should be adjusted as motor units gradually return, with progressive strengthening.","clinical_pearls":"1.

It belongs to the limb\u2010girdle and craniofacial dystrophies group. Patients develop symmetric ptosis due to levator palpebrae superioris involvement and pharyngeal muscle weakness leading to dysphagia. Differential diagnoses include mitochondrial myopathies (CPEO, Kearns\u2013Sayre), myasthenia gravis, and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. Historically, OPMD was first described in the 1960s in Quebec founder populations (3). PABPN1 is a nuclear RNA\u2010binding protein regulating poly(A) tail length; expansions (12\u201317 GCN repeats vs. normal 10) lead to misfolded aggregates. The levator palpebrae and pharyngeal muscles are particularly susceptible due to high nuclear PABPN1 expression. No significant embryological anomaly is involved\u2014this is a late\u2010onset degenerative proteinopathy.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscular physiology depends on proper nuclear RNA processing by PABPN1. In OPMD, expanded polyalanine tracts in mutant PABPN1 lead to nuclear misfolding and intranuclear aggregate formation. These aggregates sequester normal PABPN1 and other nuclear proteins, impairing mRNA polyadenylation and export, triggering proteasomal overload and endoplasmic reticulum stress (4). At the cellular level, muscle fiber nuclei contain 10\u201320 nm tubular filaments on electron microscopy. Chronic aggregate toxicity leads to myonuclear degeneration, fiber atrophy, and replacement by connective tissue.

Regular swallow assessments and nutritional support reduce aspiration risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should have annual multidisciplinary evaluations: neurologic exam, swallowing studies every 1\u20132 years, ophthalmology for blepharoplasty planning, and nutrition assessments (8). Monitor weight, aspiration signs, and pulmonary function (spirometry annually). Physical therapy assessments every 6 months to tailor exercises. Genetic counseling for family planning. There are no consensus guidelines on surveillance imaging or labs.","clinical_pearls":"1. Intranuclear tubulofilaments on EM are pathognomonic for OPMD\u2014not seen in mitochondrial myopathies. 2. Adult-onset ptosis plus dysphagia in a familial pattern strongly suggests PABPN1 expansion. 3. CK is often normal; a normal CK does not exclude OPMD. 4. Cricopharyngeal myotomy improves dysphagia in the majority of patients. 5. Front muscle compensation (e.g., brow raising) is a helpful clinical clue to longstanding ptosis.","references":"1.

He has upper limb weakness that started 6 years ago, initially affecting the right hand and progressively involving all three limbs. On physical examination, he has muscle atrophy, absent triceps reflex, and intact brachioradialis reflex. Sensory examination was normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","Multifocal motor neuron disease with conduction block","Hirayama disease ## Page 13"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is correct. ALS presents with progressive, asymmetric limb weakness, muscle atrophy, and mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs without sensory loss. In a 6-year history, survival averages 3\u20135 years but can exceed 10% beyond 10 years (Brown and Al-Chalabi 2017). EMG shows widespread denervation (Ludolph et al. 2015). Option B (Multifocal motor neuropathy) often features conduction block on NCS, sensory fibers spared but with conduction slowing and anti-GM1 antibodies in ~50% (Dalakas 2011). It usually has persistent cramps and conduction block, not progressive UMN signs (per EFNS 2010). Option C (Hirayama disease) is juvenile male\u2013predominant, distal upper limb atrophy without UMN signs, C7\u2013T1 root flexion\u2013dependent myelopathy seen on neutral and flexion MRI (Ismail and Saxena 2018). Lower limbs are spared. Option D (Primary lateral sclerosis) has exclusively UMN signs without muscle atrophy or fasciculations for >3 years (Wicks et al. 2009). Our patient has lower motor neuron atrophy and missing reflexes, excluding pure UMN disorders. Common misconception: confusing multifocal motor neuropathy\u2019s focal deficits with ALS progression; conduction block testing differentiates them (per AAN 2021 guidelines).","conceptual_foundation":"Corticospinal tract neurons originate in layer V of primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus) and descend through the internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, pons, and medullary pyramids, decussating at the lower medulla. Lower motor neurons arise in anterior horn cells of spinal cord segments C5\u2013T1 (upper limbs) and L1\u2013S1 (lower limbs). Embryologically, the neural tube gives rise to motor neurons by week 4; synaptogenesis and myelination continue through adolescence. Normally, upper motor neurons modulate fine voluntary movement via glutamatergic projections, while LMNs execute muscular contraction through acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Related syndromes: Kennedy\u2019s disease (X-linked bulbospinal atrophy) with sensory neuropathy and gynecomastia; PLS with only UMN signs. ALS was first described by Charcot in 1869, refined by autopsy correlations by Gowers (1886). Key landmarks include Betz cells in precentral gyrus and the ventral root exit zones. Clinically, UMN signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia) and LMN signs (atrophy, fasciculations) pinpoint involvement levels (Duquette and Ludolph 2020).","pathophysiology":"ALS involves degeneration of both UMNs and LMNs. Molecularly, misfolded proteins like TDP-43 accumulate in cytoplasmic inclusions, disrupting RNA processing (Neumann et al. 2006). Mutations in SOD1 (~20% familial cases), C9orf72 repeat expansions (~40% familial), and FUS (<5%) lead to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER stress. Excitotoxicity via excessive glutamate and impaired EAAT2 clearance triggers Ca2+ influx, activating calpains and caspases (Rothstein et al. 1995). Neuroinflammation with microglial activation and cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) exacerbates motor neuron death. Energy deficits from impaired glycolysis and reduced ATP lead to axonal transport failure. Pathology evolves from focal onset to contiguous spread over months to years (Braun et al. 2016). Initial compensatory sprouting of surviving motor neurons fails over time. Peripheral axonal retraction yields muscle fiber denervation, atrophy, and weakness. Disease kinetics vary: bulbar-onset median survival ~30 months vs limb-onset ~36 months (Chi\u00f2 et al. 2009).","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is insidious, usually between ages 50\u201370, with limb-onset in ~70% and bulbar-onset in ~25%. Initial symptoms include clumsiness, hand weakness, foot drop, or fasciculations. Over 6 years, weakness becomes symmetric, involving all four limbs. Examination reveals muscle atrophy, fasciculations, spasticity, and mixed reflex changes (UMN hyperreflexia with LMN hyporeflexia). Sensory exam remains intact. Pseudobulbar affect appears over months. Severity scales: ALSFRS-R declines ~0.9 points/month (Cedarbaum et al. 1999). Pediatric cases (<18) are rare (<2%). Men slightly more affected (M:F ~1.3:1). Respiratory compromise emerges when forced vital capacity drops <50% predicted. Red flags ruling out ALS include sensory loss, sphincter dysfunction, or conduction block on EMG. Without treatment, median survival is 3\u20135 years, with ~10% surviving beyond 10 years (Talbot 2000).","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical evaluation for UMN and LMN signs. Step 2: EMG/NCS to identify denervation in \u22653 spinal regions (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%) per Awaji criteria (AAN 2013). Step 3: MRI brain/spine to exclude structural lesions; protocol includes T2, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted sequences (AAN 2020). Step 4: Lab tests: CBC, B12 (200\u2013900 pg/mL), TSH (0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L), ESR (<20 mm/h) to rule out mimics (AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Step 5: CSF analysis if inflammatory neuropathy suspected: cell count <5 cells/mm3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL (EFNS 2011). Step 6: Genetic testing for familial cases (C9orf72, SOD1, FUS) when positive family history (ALSA 2018). Rule out MMN by looking for conduction block (>50% drop in CMAP amplitude, per EFNS/PNS 2010 guidelines). Use differential: PLS, hereditary spastic paraplegia, Kennedy disease (elevated CK, androgen receptor gene testing).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Riluzole 50 mg BID orally to reduce glutamate excitotoxicity (hazard ratio 0.79 for death; median survival gain ~3 months) per AAN 2018 guidelines. Edaravone IV 60 mg daily for 14 days then 10-day monthly cycles if FVC \u226580% and ALSFRS-R decline \u22641 point/month (per ALSA 2020). Tier 2 (Second-line): Sodium phenylbutyrate/taurursodiol 3 g/day orally reduces neuronal death (ALS-FRS progression slowed by 25%; per FDA 2022). Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) at \u22654 hours nightly when PaCO2 >45 mmHg (per ERS 2019). Tier 3 (Third-line): Invasive ventilation via tracheostomy for refractory respiratory failure (50% 1-year survival post-tracheostomy) per AAN 2021. PEG tube feeding when BMI <18.5 or swallowing time >30 seconds (per EFNS 2013). Physical therapy, speech therapy, and palliative care throughout (per NICE 2016). Monitor LFTs monthly on riluzole, electrolytes for edaravone, respiratory function every 3 months. Adjust doses in hepatic impairment (reduce riluzole to 50 mg once daily).","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinic visits every 3 months to assess ALSFRS-R score and FVC (target >70% predicted). Every 6 months repeat EMG/NCS if new regions symptomatic (per AAN 2022). Monitor LFTs and CBC monthly while on riluzole. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) every 3 months; initiate NIV when FVC <50% (per ERS 2019). Dysphagia screening quarterly; refer to speech-language pathologist. Nutritional assessment biannually; consider PEG when >10% weight loss or swallowing time >30 seconds (per EFNS 2013). 1-year survival ~80%; 5-year survival ~20% (Talbot 2000). Coordinate with physical, occupational therapy for assistive devices over first year. Educate patients on advance directives, respiratory emergency plans. Driving re-evaluation when FVC <50% or limb strength severely impaired. Refer to ALS associations and support groups for psychosocial resources.","clinical_pearls":"1. ALS requires both UMN and LMN signs in \u22653 regions per revised El Escorial criteria. 2. Fasciculations in \u22653 muscles support diagnosis but aren\u2019t specific. 3. Conduction block on NCS excludes ALS; consider MMN (EFNS 2010). 4. Riluzole and edaravone are only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies. 5. ALS incidence ~2/100,000; familial in ~10% of cases. 6. Avoid high-dose steroids or immunosuppressants unless alternate diagnosis. 7. Early referral for respiratory evaluation improves quality of life. 8. C9orf72 expansions can present with frontotemporal dementia overlap. 9. ALSFRS-R is the standard functional scale. 10.
