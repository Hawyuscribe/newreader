The classical vacuolar myelopathy is characterized by spongiform degeneration of the lateral and posterior columns. It usually presents with progressive gait dysfunction, spastic paraparesis, and dorsal column signs. CSF in HIV myelopathy may show mild lymphocytic pleocytosis but rarely demonstrates oligoclonal bands specific to this diagnosis. Moreover, MRI features typically reveal symmetrical spinal cord atrophy or T2 hyperintensity confined to the thoracic region rather than an extensive, continuous lesion extending into the cauda equina. Option C: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) myelitis can cause acute flaccid paralysis with polyradiculopathy, often in severely immunocompromised individuals, associated with CSF pleocytosis, low glucose, and high protein. MRI may show T2 hyperintense lesions but usually lacks a longitudinally extensive involvement from thoracic cord through conus. Sphincter dysfunction is seen but lesions are not typically so continuous. Option D: Progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) can rarely produce a longitudinally extensive lesion known as LETM-like MS, but MS typically presents with brain lesions, periventricular or juxtacortical MRI findings, and CSF OCBs are paired rather than unpaired. The age and epidemiology favor HTLV-1. Option B: Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 myelopathy (HAM/TSP) is characterized by chronic progressive spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, and urinary dysfunction. CSF OCB unpaired bands and a longitudinally extensive T2 hyperintense lesion from thoracic cord to conus are classic. Given the patient\u2019s origin from Africa, which has endemic HTLV-1, option B is correct.","Conceptual Foundation":"Anatomical structures include the long spinal cord tracts: corticospinal, spinothalamic, and dorsal columns. The thoracic cord segments serve as a watershed zone for blood supply and are particularly susceptible to inflammatory insults. The cauda equina comprises nerve roots below L1, vulnerable to radiculoneuropathic processes. In HTLV-1 associated myelopathy, there is selective degeneration of the lateral corticospinal tracts, dorsal columns, and to a lesser extent spinocerebellar fibers. This results in spastic paraparesis, impaired proprioception, and gait ataxia. Differential diagnoses affecting similar pathways include infectious myelitis from HIV, CMV, neuromyelitis optica, and sarcoidosis. HTLV-1 preferentially targets CD4+ T lymphocytes within the CNS, leading to chronic inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss. The longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) pattern \u2013 lesions extending over three or more vertebral segments \u2013 is characteristic of HTLV-1 and neuromyelitis optica but absent in classical MS. Recognition of conus involvement is critical because it correlates with early sphincter disturbance, a hallmark of HTLV-1 myelopathy not typically seen in vacuolar myelopathy due to HIV.","Pathophysiology":"Molecular and cellular mechanisms: HTLV-1 is a retrovirus infecting CD4+ T lymphocytes, crossing the blood-brain barrier via infected lymphocytes. The viral Tax protein triggers chronic immune activation, upregulating IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-gamma, sustaining persistent inflammation. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells target HTLV-1 antigens in the spinal cord, inadvertently causing bystander axonal injury and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Neuronal degeneration is mediated by nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and excitotoxic glutamate release. Genetic predisposition factors include HLA-A*02 positivity, which influences proviral load. Inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha disrupt tight junctions, facilitating more lymphocyte trafficking. Demyelination follows involvement of oligodendroglial membranes, with resulting T2 hyperintensity on MRI. Distinct from autoimmune demyelination in MS, HTLV-1 myelopathy is driven by viral persistence, clonal expansion of infected T cells, and cytotoxic bystander damage rather than autoantibodies. Neurotransmitter imbalances, including elevated spinal glutamate, contribute to spasticity via enhanced NMDA receptor signaling. Epigenetic regulation by histone deacetylases also modulates viral transcription and may represent a treatment target.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy typically present in the fourth to sixth decades with chronic insidious onset of back pain, progressing to bilateral lower extremity weakness and spasticity over months to years. Sensory deficits include numbness, paresthesia, and vibration sense loss beginning in the feet and ascending to the abdomen. Spinal reflexes are hyperactive with extensor plantar responses. Early sphincter dysfunction manifests as urinary urgency, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, nocturia, and in advanced cases fecal incontinence. Painful paraspinal muscle spasms and gait ataxia contribute to falls. Variations in presentation range from slowly progressive to subacute exacerbations resembling transverse myelitis. Prognostic indicators include baseline viral load, proviral DNA levels in PBMCs, and early CSF protein elevation. A higher proviral burden correlates with more rapid progression. Oligoclonal bands in CSF with unpaired bands suggest intrathecal HTLV-1 antibody synthesis. Imaging shows LETM extending over multiple segments, distinguishing it from focal lesions in MS. Disability is measured by the Osame motor disability score, with higher scores indicating increased assistance for ambulation and higher risk of secondary complications.","Diagnostic Approach":"A systematic diagnostic algorithm for suspected HTLV-1 myelopathy includes first excluding vitamin deficiencies, compressive myelopathy via MRI, and common mimickers like MS and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Initial tests: CBC, B12, folate, HIV serology, ANA, aquaporin-4 IgG, and HTLV-1/2 antibody ELISA. Positive HTLV-1 ELISA should be confirmed by Western blot or PCR for proviral DNA. CSF analysis typically reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis (0-50 cells/\u00b5L), protein elevation (50-200 mg/dL), and oligoclonal bands unique to CSF. Intrathecal HTLV-1 antibody index >1.5 supports diagnosis. MRI of the spine demonstrates a longitudinally extensive T2 hyperintense signal spanning three or more vertebral segments, often continuous from the mid-thoracic cord to the conus, without gadolinium enhancement or central necrosis. Electrophysiology: somatosensory evoked potentials show delayed central conduction time. Differential diagnoses: neuromyelitis optica (AQP4 positive, astrocyte injury), sarcoidosis (systemic involvement, ACE levels), idiopathic transverse myelitis (monophasic). A multidisciplinary team including neurology, infectious disease, and rehabilitation medicine refines the diagnosis and initiates early intervention.","Management Principles":"Treatment options for HTLV-1 myelopathy focus on reducing inflammation and viral load. First-line pharmacotherapy includes high-dose corticosteroids: methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3\u20135 days, transitioning to oral prednisone taper over several weeks. Chronic management may involve interferon-alpha 3\u20136 million IU subcutaneously thrice weekly, which has shown modest proviral load reduction and clinical stabilization. Antiretroviral therapies like zidovudine (300 mg PO twice daily) combined with lamivudine (150 mg PO twice daily) are under investigation; however, data on efficacy are limited. Emerging treatments targeting the IL-2 receptor (e.g., denileukin diftitox) or monoclonal anti-CCR4 antibody (mogamulizumab) are in clinical trials. Spasticity is managed with baclofen (5 mg PO TID, titrate to 80 mg/day) or tizanidine (2 mg PO TID). Neuropathic pain responds to gabapentin (300 mg PO TID) or duloxetine (60 mg PO daily). Regular monitoring includes complete blood count, liver function tests, and proviral load assays every 6 months. Contraindications to interferon-alpha include severe depression and autoimmune disorders. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy to maintain mobility, pelvic floor rehabilitation for sphincter control, and occupational therapy for adaptive equipment are essential components of comprehensive care.","Follow-up Guidelines":"Follow-up protocols for HTLV-1 myelopathy include outpatient visits every 3 to 6 months, focusing on neurological examination, motor disability scoring, and spasticity evaluation. Proviral load and CD4+ T cell counts should be monitored biannually to assess disease progression and treatment response. CSF analysis may be repeated annually if clinical deterioration occurs to evaluate inflammatory markers and oligoclonal band status. MRI spine imaging is recommended every 1\u20132 years or sooner if new neurological deficits emerge. Long-term complications such as osteoporosis from corticosteroids, urinary tract infections from chronic catheter use, and decubitus ulcers require proactive screening. Urodynamic studies should be performed annually to adjust bladder management strategies. Vaccinations against influenza, pneumococcus, and tetanus are advised. Patient education must cover adherence to pharmacotherapy, recognition of exacerbation signs, and lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise and smoking cessation. Psychological support services and peer group involvement can improve coping strategies and quality of life. Early referral to a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team optimizes functional outcomes. Nutritional counseling for bone health is also recommended.","Clinical Pearls":"High-yield clinical insights: HTLV-1 myelopathy should be suspected in patients from endemic regions (Japan, Caribbean, Africa) with progressive spastic paraparesis and sphincter disturbance. MRI LETM extending from thoracic cord to conus is characteristic. Unpaired CSF oligoclonal bands indicate intrathecal HTLV-1 antibody synthesis. Avoid misdiagnosis as MS; HTLV-1 lesions rarely enhance and lack periventricular brain involvement. Early corticosteroid therapy may slow progression but not reverse established deficits. Monitor proviral load to gauge treatment efficacy. Common pitfalls include attributing symptoms to HIV vacuolar myelopathy or vitamin B12 deficiency without confirming HTLV-1 serology. Board tip: always include HTLV-1/2 testing in the workup of longitudinally extensive myelitis. Recent guideline updates emphasize the potential of anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors as novel therapies. Collaborative care with infectious disease specialists optimizes antiviral strategies. Rehabilitation interventions significantly improve mobility and reduce secondary complications. Always counsel patients regarding sexual and vertical transmission risks, and recommend routine screening of family members if HTLV-1 positive.","References":"1. Gessain A, Cassar O.

The indolent back pain, ascending lower extremity weakness, a clear sensory level at T10, spastic features evidenced by upgoing plantar responses alongside absent ankle reflexes, and sphincter dysfunction reflect chronic cord ischemia from venous hypertension. MRI shows longitudinal T2 hyperintensity spanning multiple segments with a central hypointense core, corresponding to congested medullary veins or hemosiderin deposits. Serpiginous flow voids on the dorsal cord surface further support vascular malformation. In contrast, progressive multiple sclerosis presents with discrete, ovoid demyelinating plaques often involving brain white matter, with relapsing\u2013remitting episodes and CSF oligoclonal bands. MS lesions rarely yield a defined sensory level or central hypointense signal. Therapeutically, dAVF requires endovascular or surgical disconnection to relieve venous congestion, whereas progressive MS management focuses on immunomodulation. Early recognition of dAVF optimizes neurological recovery, while misdiagnosis as MS can delay definitive treatment and lead to irreversible deficits.","Conceptual Foundation":"The spinal cord receives arterial blood via the anterior spinal artery and paired posterior spinal arteries, supplemented by segmental radiculomedullary branches. Venous drainage is accomplished by intrinsic sulcal veins that feed into a circumferential perimedullary plexus, which then empties into epidural veins. In a dural arteriovenous fistula, an abnormal shunt links a radicular artery directly to a medullary vein within the dural sleeve, increasing venous pressure. Retrograde venous hypertension compromises capillary perfusion by reducing the arteriovenous pressure gradient, leading to chronic ischemia. Motor tracts in the lateral columns and sensory tracts in the dorsal columns at or below T10 become dysfunctional. Disruption of anterior horn cells contributes to early areflexia in root zones, whereas corticospinal tract involvement produces upper motor neuron signs. Understanding this vascular anatomy, including the dura mater\u2019s meningeal branches and perimedullary venous loops, enables accurate localization, guides diagnostic angiography, and informs surgical or endovascular approaches.","Pathophysiology":"A spinal dural arteriovenous fistula is characterized by pathological arterialization of the perimedullary venous plexus. Meningeal branches of segmental arteries shunt directly into draining veins, bypassing the capillary bed. High\u2010pressure arterial flow induces venous hypertension, diminishing cord perfusion pressure and causing chronic hypoxia. Endothelial cells respond to increased shear stress by releasing inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), disrupting the blood\u2013spinal cord barrier. Astrocyte proliferation and microglial activation follow, resulting in gliosis and demyelination. Accumulated deoxyhemoglobin and hemosiderin from venous stasis create a central hypointense signal on T2 sequences. Elevated extracellular glutamate induces excitotoxicity, exacerbating neuronal damage. Unlike multiple sclerosis, where autoimmunity drives demyelination, dAVF pathology is vascular and hemodynamic. No specific genetic predisposition has been confirmed, though dural sinus remodeling may contribute. Post-closure reperfusion can transiently worsen edema via oxidative stress, emphasizing the need for controlled hemodynamics during intervention.","Clinical Manifestation":"Thoracic dAVF patients often present in middle age with insidious onset back pain due to epidural venous distention. Symptoms progress to bilateral lower extremity weakness, gait ataxia, and spastic paraparesis. A distinct sensory level emerges as dorsal column and spinothalamic pathways become compromised; T10 involvement produces band-like numbness around the umbilicus. Early in disease, nerve root congestion causes hyporeflexia or areflexia at the ankles, while corticospinal tract impairment yields upgoing plantar responses. Sphincter involvement manifests as urinary urgency, retention, or incontinence, and bowel dysfunction in advanced cases. Although male predominance is noted, females can present similarly, as in this 30-year-old. Intermittent claudication may occur with exertion. Prognostic factors include symptom duration (longer than one year predicts poorer outcome) and baseline impairment scored by Aminoff-Logue disability scale. Rapid progression or acute deterioration often indicates hemorrhagic conversion or thrombosis of the fistula.","Diagnostic Approach":"Begin with high\u2010resolution spinal MRI. Key indicators of dAVF include longitudinal T2 hyperintensity spanning several segments, with a central hypointense core representing dilated veins or microhemorrhage. Dorsal serpiginous flow voids on T2\u2010weighted images are pathognomonic. Gadolinium enhancement may reveal engorged perimedullary veins. In contrast, MS plaques appear ovoid, periventricular, asymmetric, and often shorter in length. CSF analysis in suspected MS shows oligoclonal bands; in dAVF, protein may be elevated without inflammation. When MRI suggests a vascular lesion, digital subtraction spinal angiography is the gold standard for precise localization of the fistula\u2019s feeding artery and draining veins. It also guides endovascular intervention. Exclude other etiologies such as intramedullary tumors, sarcoidosis, and compressive myelopathies via contrast patterns, systemic investigations, and electrophysiological studies.","Management Principles":"Definitive treatment of thoracic dAVF is occlusion of the arteriovenous shunt. Endovascular embolization with liquid agents (N-butyl cyanoacrylate or Onyx) is first\u2010line when arterial feeders can be selectively catheterized without compromising spinal cord perfusion. Surgical ligation through a limited laminotomy offers an alternative when endovascular avenues are unsafe or unsuccessful. High\u2010dose corticosteroids are contraindicated because they exacerbate venous congestion. Neuropathic pain can be managed with gabapentin (300\u2013900 mg daily). Post-embolization, maintain strict blood pressure control to minimize edema and perform serial neurological exams. Physical therapy should begin early to preserve mobility. Bladder function requires timed voiding or clean intermittent catheterization. Follow-up MRI at three to six months confirms fistula closure. Anticoagulation is not routinely indicated.","Follow-up Guidelines":"After successful fistula occlusion, patients require structured follow-up. Conduct neurological examinations monthly for three months, then every three to six months in the first year, focusing on strength, sensation, gait, and autonomic function. Obtain repeat spinal MRI with and without contrast at six months to verify resolution of cord edema and absence of residual flow voids. Consider annual imaging thereafter if symptoms plateau or recur. Early referral to rehabilitation medicine optimizes functional recovery and addresses spasticity and mobility challenges. Urology evaluation for persistent bladder dysfunction ensures adequate management. Educate patients on symptom vigilance, specifically new back pain, gait changes, or urinary disturbances, to facilitate prompt re-evaluation. A multidisciplinary team including interventional neuroradiology, neurosurgery, neurology, physiatry, and urology maximizes long-term outcomes.","Clinical Pearls":"Always consider a dural arteriovenous fistula in progressive myelopathy with a defined sensory level and longitudinal T2 cord edema. Serpiginous dorsal flow voids and a central hypointense core are high-yield MRI findings. Absence of brain lesions and oligoclonal bands differentiates dAVF from multiple sclerosis. Avoid empiric corticosteroids, which may worsen venous hypertension. Spinal angiography remains the diagnostic gold standard and directs embolization or surgical ligation. Early intervention within the first year correlates with better functional recovery. Use the Aminoff-Logue scale to quantify disability and track response. Recent guidelines advocate combined vascular intervention with early rehabilitation to enhance neuroplasticity. Recognizing this vascular myelopathy on boards is critical to avoid misdiagnosis as demyelinating disease.","References":"1. Rosenblum B, Boukobza M, Chiras J. Neurosurgery. 2012.

Relapse occurs in ~12% of patients, higher if no tumor is identified or if immunotherapy is delayed.","clinical_pearls":"1) Removal of an ovarian teratoma within 4 weeks of symptom onset is associated with better functional outcomes. 2) Anti-NMDAR encephalitis should be suspected in young women with new-onset psychosis and movement disorders. 3) CSF antibody testing is more sensitive than serum; do not rely solely on serum results. 4) Extreme delta brush on EEG is highly suggestive though not pathognomonic. 5) Early second-line therapy reduces long-term cognitive sequelae in patients refractory to first-line immunotherapy.","references":"1.
