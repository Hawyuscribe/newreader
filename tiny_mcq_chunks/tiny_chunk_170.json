Phenylketonuria (PKU) results from phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, leading to hyperphenylalaninemia, neurotoxicity, microcephaly, seizures, developmental delay, and a characteristic musty or 'mousy' odor of urine and sweat due to phenylacetate accumulation. Option A (Biotinidase deficiency) presents with seizures, hypotonia, skin rash, alopecia, and metabolic acidosis, but not a musty odor. Option C (Maple syrup urine disease) has a sweet burnt sugar odor and presents acutely with poor feeding and vomiting. Option D (Galactosemia) presents in neonates with feeding intolerance, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and cataracts, without a musty odor.","conceptual_foundation":"PKU is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism (ICD-11 5C68.0).

Newborn screening via tandem mass spectrometry allows early detection and dietary intervention. Differential includes BH4 deficiency variants, requiring distinct therapeutic approaches.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, PAH in hepatocytes and renal cells converts phenylalanine to tyrosine using BH4. In PKU, PAH deficiency leads to toxic levels of phenylalanine that cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, impairing myelination and neurotransmitter (dopamine, serotonin) synthesis and causing cerebral atrophy. Excess phenylalanine competitively inhibits transport of other large neutral amino acids, exacerbating neurotransmitter deficits and neurodevelopmental delay.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic PKU manifests by 2\u20136 months with progressive microcephaly, intellectual disability, seizures, hypopigmentation, eczema, and a musty odor.

No other condition demonstrates this constellation of posterior fossa malformations. There are no competing options provided.","conceptual_foundation":"Joubert syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive cerebellar vermis malformation (ICD-11: 8A05.0) first described in 1969 by Marie Joubert. It belongs to the spectrum of ciliopathies, sharing genetic mutations (e.g., AHI1, NPHP1, CEP290) that impair primary cilia function during hindbrain development. Embryologically, cerebellar vermis formation involves rhombic lip migration in the fourth ventricle roof; disruption leads to vermian hypoplasia. Related disorders include COACH syndrome and orofaciodigital syndromes.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebellar development requires coordinated neuronal migration and axonal decussation within the superior cerebellar peduncles. In Joubert syndrome, mutations in ciliary proteins disrupt sonic hedgehog signaling and Wnt pathways, causing vermian hypoplasia and failure of decussation. The resulting elongation and thickening of the superior cerebellar peduncles create the molar tooth appearance on axial imaging. Neuronal circuitry deficits in Purkinje cells and deep cerebellar nuclei underlie the clinical syndrome.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present in infancy with axial hypotonia, appendicular ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and episodic hyperpnea or apnea. Developmental delay is universal, with cognitive impairment ranging from mild to severe. Additional features include retinal dystrophy, renal cystic disease, hepatic fibrosis, and polydactyly in some variants. Natural history involves persistent motor and cognitive deficits with variable life expectancy depending on multisystem involvement.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI is the gold standard: high-resolution T1/T2 axial images demonstrate vermian hypoplasia, elongated superior cerebellar peduncles, and deep interpeduncular fossa. Genetic testing via a ciliopathy panel confirms diagnosis. Ophthalmologic exam, renal ultrasound, and liver function tests assess associated manifestations. Prenatal ultrasound may show absent vermis and molar tooth appearance by fetal MRI in the second trimester.","management_principles":"No curative therapy exists.

However, citing only normal neonatal appearance neglects later manifestations. Option B: \u201cSevere mental retardation\u201d occurs in untreated PKU, with 98% of patients demonstrating IQ <40 by age 2 if untreated (F\u00f6lling cohort, 1950\u20131960). This underlines cognitive impairment from demyelination, neurotransmitter deficiency, and excitotoxicity. Option C: \u201cEczema\u201d or atopic dermatitis is present in up to 40\u201360% of untreated PKU patients due to immune dysregulation and epidermal barrier defects (Blau et al., 2010). Pruritic rash on extensor surfaces is common by 6\u201312 months. Option D: \u201cAll of the above\u201d is definitively correct because PKU\u2019s phenotypic spectrum includes initial normal exam (A), progressive intellectual disability (B), and dermatologic findings (C). Pathophysiologically, PAH enzyme deficiency leads to systemic Phe buildup, competitive inhibition of tyrosine transport across the blood\u2013brain barrier, reduced catecholamine synthesis, and altered skin immune function. Common misconceptions involve attributing early normal exam to benign disease or overlooking dermatologic signs. Landmark studies report 100% of untreated cases develop cognitive impairment by age 3 (NIH Consensus Statement, 2000). Misreading of AAP newborn screening frequency can mislead examinees into excluding option A, but all three features are part of classical PKU.","conceptual_foundation":"Phenylketonuria (PKU) centers on the liver\u2019s phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which converts Phe to tyrosine (Tyr). Anatomically, toxic Phe accumulation affects the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and white matter tracts, impairing myelination and synaptic maturation. During embryogenesis, PAH gene expression in hepatic progenitors begins by gestational week 12; defects disrupt neural crest cell migration and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Normally, Phe/Tyr flux is tightly regulated by cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and hepatic monooxygenase systems. Related conditions include hyperphenylalaninemia variants (malignant PKU due to BH4 deficiency) and non-PKU tyrosinemias. Historically, Asbj\u00f8rn F\u00f8lling first described PKU in 1934, with Guthrie\u2019s bacterial inhibition assay introduced in 1963 for neonatal screening. Key landmarks: PAH gene on 12q23.2, blood\u2013brain barrier LAT1 transporter, and neonatal heel\u2010prick testing. Clinical significance arises from early detection preventing irreversible neurocognitive deficits. The evolution from dietary interventions in the 1950s to sapropterin (BH4 analog) and pegvaliase enzyme therapy reflects deepening understanding of PAH biochemistry and genetic heterogeneity.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, classical PKU stems from autosomal recessive PAH gene mutations (over 500 pathogenic variants described) leading to <1% residual enzyme activity. Phe hydroxylation to Tyr requires BH4, oxygen, and NADH; PAH deficiency causes Phe accumulation (>20 mg/dL) and reduced Tyr synthesis. Elevated Phe competitively inhibits large neutral amino acid (LNAA) transporters (LAT1) at the blood\u2013brain barrier, decreasing tryptophan and tyrosine entry, thereby impairing serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine production. Downstream, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress trigger microglial activation and inflammatory cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), further damaging oligodendrocytes. Metabolites phenylpyruvate and phenylacetate accumulate, causing mitochondrial dysfunction and energy failure. Cellular compensatory mechanisms, such as upregulation of alternative LNAA transporters, are insufficient beyond early infancy. Without intervention, white matter vacuolization and hypomyelination progress over months, peaking by 12\u201324 months. In BH4\u2010deficient subtypes, hyperphenylalaninemia coexists with neurotransmitter cofactor deficiency, worsening movement disorders. The time course: Phe levels rise within days, neurologic changes evident by 3\u20136 months, irreversible neurodevelopmental deficits by age 2 if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"The symptom timeline in untreated PKU begins with a normal neonatal exam; by 3\u20136 months, developmental delay and hypotonia emerge. By 6\u201312 months, patients often develop eczematous rash, musty odor (phenylacetate excretion), and hyperactivity. Neurological examination reveals microcephaly, spasticity, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and athetosis in BH4\u2010responsive variants. Seizures occur in 25\u201330%, predominately infantile spasms or generalized tonic\u2013clonic by age 1\u20132. IQ declines to <50 in 98% by age 2 without dietary control. In adolescents and adults with poor control, executive dysfunction, mood disorders, and tremor are common. No significant gender differences exist, though pregnancy requires strict Phe management to prevent maternal PKU syndrome. Systemic manifestations include osteopenia (30% incidence), growth retardation, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Severity scales (e.g., PKU Severity Score) grade neurocognitive impact on a 0\u20134 scale. Red flags: Phe >20 mg/dL, IQ drop >20 points/year. Natural history without treatment leads to irreversible intellectual disability, behavioral issues, and dermatologic and systemic complications.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Newborn screening via heel\u2010prick Phe quantification at 24\u201348 h of life; sensitivity 99.5%, specificity 98.7% (per AAP 2021 newborn screening guidelines).

Genetic testing evolved in the 1990s with PCR and MLPA methodologies, replacing routine muscle biopsy. The dystrophin protein links the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix at the sarcolemma; its absence leads to muscle fiber fragility.","pathophysiology":"Dystrophin stabilizes the sarcolemma during muscle contraction. In DMD, out-of-frame mutations cause truncated or absent dystrophin, leading to repeated muscle fiber damage, necrosis, and replacement with fat and connective tissue. Chronic inflammatory response and impaired regeneration accelerate muscle loss. Calcium influx through damaged membranes activates proteases. The progressive cycle of injury and regeneration exhausts satellite cells, culminating in fibrosis and contractures.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is by age 5 with delayed motor milestones, frequent falls, Gower\u2019s sign, calf pseudohypertrophy, and proximal weakness.
