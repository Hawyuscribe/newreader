Large cohort studies of biopsy\u2010proven GCA report headache in over 80% of patients at presentation (AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines, Level B). AION (Option A) occurs in approximately 20\u201325% of untreated cases (Hunder et al. 2015) and polymyalgia rheumatica (Option C) in 40\u201350% but less commonly as the initial presenting feature alone. Headache\u2019s high prevalence and specificity in older adults with new-onset temporal pain make it the most common and sensitive symptom (sensitivity 0.85, specificity 0.70; Hayreh et al. 2017). Incorrect options A and C are less common initial manifestations and often occur later or in conjunction with headache and systemic symptoms.","conceptual_foundation":"GCA is a large-vessel vasculitis of medium and large arteries, classified under the ICD-11 as 8B43. GCA primarily affects branches of the external carotid artery and the aorta. Its pathogenesis involves granulomatous inflammation and giant cells at the internal elastic lamina. Risk factors include age >50, female sex, and northern European descent. Differential diagnoses include tension-type headache, temporal arteritis mimics, and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Historically described by Horton in 1932, classification criteria evolved from American College of Rheumatology 1990 to the 2021 AHA/ASA revisions, emphasizing temporal artery biopsy or ultrasound findings.","pathophysiology":"Normal arterial function relies on an intact endothelium and elastic lamina. In GCA, CD4+ T cells and macrophages infiltrate the adventitia and media, releasing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6, leading to granuloma formation and intimal hyperplasia. Luminal narrowing causes ischemia manifesting as headache or AION. Elevated acute-phase reactants (ESR, CRP) reflect systemic inflammation. Chronic inflammation can progress to aneurysm formation in the aorta. Cytokine blockade (e.g., tocilizumab targeting IL-6R) disrupts this cascade (Villiger et al. 2016).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present after age 50 with new-onset, often unilateral temporal headache (\u226580%). Jaw claudication occurs in 40%, PMR symptoms in 40\u201350%, visual disturbances in 20\u201325% (AION, diplopia). Systemic symptoms include fever, weight loss, and malaise. Headache is most common initial complaint; PMR may precede or coincide. Visual loss is an emergency. PMR without headache can occur but is secondary to GCA in only ~10% of PMR cases.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes ESR and CRP (sensitivity ~0.97, specificity ~0.55) and duplex ultrasound of temporal arteries (halo sign sensitivity 0.69, specificity 0.82; Level B). Temporal artery biopsy remains gold standard (sensitivity ~0.85). Cross-sectional imaging (PET-CT, MRI) can evaluate large-vessel involvement. Pre-test probability is based on age, headache, jaw claudication, and ESR. Negative biopsy does not exclude GCA; bilateral sampling is recommended.","management_principles":"Immediate high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 40\u201360 mg/day) should be initiated upon suspicion to prevent AION (AHA/ASA 2021, Class I). Tapering begins after normalization of inflammatory markers over 12\u201318 months. Tocilizumab (IL-6R antagonist) is approved for refractory or relapsing GCA (Stone et al. 2017; NNT 4). Low\u2010dose aspirin may reduce ischemic complications (Ridker et al. 1991). Monitor for steroid-related adverse effects and consider bone protection.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monthly follow-up initially with ESR/CRP monitoring to guide taper. Imaging for aortic aneurysm surveillance at diagnosis and at 1\u20132 years. Monitor for relapse signs (return of headache, elevated ESR). Adjust steroid dose accordingly. Long-term follow-up includes bone density checks, glucose monitoring, and blood pressure management.","clinical_pearls":"1. New-onset temporal headache in >50-year-old mandates GCA workup. 2. Jaw claudication is highly specific (specificity 0.95). 3. PMR coexists in ~50%\u2014evaluate both. 4. Start steroids before biopsy to prevent vision loss. 5.

Galactosidase. The triad of renal impairment, cerebrovascular events (stroke), and cutaneous angiokeratomas is characteristic of Fabry disease, caused by alpha-galactosidase A deficiency. Enzyme assay measuring alpha-galactosidase A activity confirms the diagnosis in males. Options B, C, and D are not provided.","conceptual_foundation":"Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to GLA gene mutations on chromosome Xq22 leading to deficient alpha-galactosidase A (EC 3.2.1.22). Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulates in endothelial cells, renal cells, and neurons. It is classified within 'Disorders of sphingolipid metabolism' in ICD-11. First described in 1898 and elucidated enzymatically in the 1970s, Fabry disease demonstrates phenotypic heterogeneity, particularly among female carriers due to random X-chromosome inactivation.","pathophysiology":"Alpha-galactosidase A hydrolyzes terminal alpha-galactosyl residues from glycosphingolipids. Deficiency leads to progressive Gb3 accumulation in lysosomes, disrupting cellular function. Vascular endothelial Gb3 deposition causes small-vessel vasculopathy, underpinning renal dysfunction and cerebrovascular events. Dermal capillary involvement leads to angiokeratomas. In the nervous system, Gb3 accumulation in dorsal root ganglia contributes to acroparesthesias.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic Fabry disease in males presents with episodic acroparesthesias, hypohidrosis, and angiokeratomas typically in adolescence. Renal involvement manifests as proteinuria progressing to end-stage renal disease by the fourth to fifth decade. Stroke affects ~25% of untreated males by age 40. Cardiac involvement may include left ventricular hypertrophy and arrhythmias.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis in males relies on alpha-galactosidase A activity assay (<1% activity confirms disease). In females, enzyme levels may be normal, requiring GLA gene sequencing. Urinary Gb3 or plasma lyso-Gb3 levels support diagnosis. Kidney biopsy with electron microscopy revealing zebra bodies is confirmatory if noninvasive tests are inconclusive.","management_principles":"Enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alpha (0.2 mg/kg biweekly) or agalsidase beta (1.0 mg/kg biweekly) reduces Gb3 deposition and alleviates neuropathic pain. Adjunctive therapies include ACE inhibitors for proteinuria and antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention. Chaperone therapy with migalastat is effective in patients with amenable GLA mutations.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes annual assessments of renal function (eGFR, proteinuria), cardiac evaluation (echocardiogram, ECG), and neurologic symptom monitoring. Brain MRI every 2\u20133 years is recommended in patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. Anti\u2013drug antibody monitoring is advised during ERT.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Angioedema of the tongue after tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is mediated by bradykinin and complement activation. Current AHA/ASA guidelines recommend immediate administration of corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) plus H\u2081 receptor antagonists (e.g., diphenhydramine) and H\u2082 blockers to reduce swelling. Option A (intubation) is reserved only if airway compromise develops; this patient is stable. Option C (ACE inhibitor with diuretics) is contraindicated because ACE inhibitors increase bradykinin and diuretics have no role in acute angioedema management.","conceptual_foundation":"tPA\u2013associated angioedema occurs in up to 1\u20135% of stroke patients. It is a bradykinin-mediated non-IgE reaction. Clinically, it presents 30 minutes to several hours after infusion onset. Differential includes allergic angioedema, hereditary angioedema, and idiopathic causes. Understanding the kinin\u2013kallikrein pathway is essential: tPA increases plasmin which degrades high-molecular-weight kininogen to bradykinin, leading to vascular permeability.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, C1 esterase activity and ACE degrade bradykinin. tPA infusion increases plasmin, which enhances bradykinin production and complement activation (C3a, C5a), leading to mast cell degranulation and vascular leakage. Steroids inhibit cytokine production, while antihistamines block H\u2081-mediated capillary permeability. Without treatment, progressive swelling can compromise the airway.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with unilateral or bilateral tongue or oropharyngeal swelling, dysarthria, and drooling within 30\u2013120 minutes of tPA administration.

Unlike allergic reactions, urticaria and hypotension are uncommon.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical. Monitor all tPA recipients for signs of oropharyngeal swelling every 15 minutes during infusion and hourly for 6 hours thereafter. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy can quantify laryngeal edema if available. Differentiation from allergic anaphylaxis is based on absence of hypotension, bronchospasm, and urticaria.","management_principles":"Immediate discontinuation of tPA infusion, head-elevated position, high-flow oxygen, and administer IV corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 125 mg), H\u2081 blocker (diphenhydramine 50 mg IV), and H\u2082 blocker (famotidine 20 mg IV).

This is primarily due to the pathophysiological effects of the disease on the vasculature of the central nervous system. In TBM, the inflammation and exudates resulting from the infection preferentially encase the vessels at the base of the brain, with a significant impact on the MCA and its perforating branches. This results in a higher likelihood of ischemic events, such as infarcts, in the MCA territory, which correlates with the specific focal neurological deficits observed in patients.","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberculosis, primarily caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can manifest in various forms, including pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB, the latter including tuberculous meningitis. TBM occurs when the bacilli invade the central nervous system, leading to the development of meningeal inflammation and exudates. \n\nUnderstanding the anatomy of the cerebral circulation is crucial in appreciating why the MCA is most affected. The MCA is a major branch of the internal carotid artery and supplies a large portion of the lateral cerebral hemisphere. Its extensive vascular territory includes critical functional areas responsible for motor control and sensory processing, making its involvement in TBM clinically significant.\n\nIn terms of pathophysiology, TBM leads to an inflammatory response characterized by the accumulation of lymphocytes, macrophages, and the formation of granulomas. This response can lead to vasculitis, resulting in the encasement and inflammation of the MCA and its branches.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiological mechanisms involved in tuberculous meningitis are complex and multifactorial.

Once in the CNS, the bacteria induce a robust immune response, characterized by:","clinical_manifestation":"Tuberculous meningitis typically presents with a variety of signs and symptoms, which may evolve over several days to weeks. Common clinical manifestations include:\n\n- Fever: Persistent fever is a common early sign of TBM and is often accompanied by chills and night sweats.\n\n- Headache: Severe, recurrent headaches are frequent and can be debilitating.\n\n- Meningeal Signs: Classic signs of meningeal irritation, such as nuchal rigidity (stiff neck), photophobia (sensitivity to light), and Kernig\u2019s sign, may be present.\n\n- Altered Mental Status: Patients can exhibit confusion, lethargy, or even coma, especially as the disease progresses.\n\n- Neurological Deficits: Focal neurological deficits may arise due to ischemic changes in the brain, particularly in the territory of the MCA. These may include weakness or sensory loss in specific limbs or facial asymmetry.\n\n- Seizures: Seizures can occur due to cortical irritation from inflammation or from the presence of infarcts.\n\nRecognizing these clinical manifestations is crucial for timely diagnosis and management.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis involves a combination of clinical assessment, imaging, and laboratory tests:\n\n- Clinical Evaluation: A thorough history and physical examination focusing on the neurological examination are vital.\n\n- Lumbar Puncture (LP): The gold standard for diagnosing TBM is analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF findings in TBM typically show:\n  - Elevated protein levels\n  - Low glucose levels (hypoglycorrhachia)\n  - Lymphocytic pleocytosis (increased white blood cells with a predominance of lymphocytes)\n\n- Microbiological Testing: Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears and cultures can be performed on CSF, although they may take time to yield results. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for M. tuberculosis DNA can provide faster results.\n\n- Neuroimaging: MRI or CT scans of the brain may show basal meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, and ischemic changes in the MCA territory.\n\n- Differential Diagnosis: Other causes of meningitis (e.g., viral, bacterial, fungal) must be ruled out. The presence of specific clinical features and CSF analysis helps differentiate TBM from these conditions.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nManagement of tuberculous meningitis involves a combination of pharmacological and supportive therapies:\n\n- Antitubercular Therapy: The standard treatment regimen typically includes a combination of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for an initial period (usually 2 months), followed by a continuation phase (usually 4-7 months) with isoniazid and rifampin.\n\n- Corticosteroids: Adjuvant therapy with corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, is often recommended to reduce inflammation and prevent complications like vasculitis and cerebral edema.\n\n- Supportive Care: Management of complications such as hydrocephalus may require interventions like ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Monitoring for adverse effects of medications and managing symptoms (e.g., headache, seizures) is crucial.\n\n- Nutritional Support: Providing adequate nutrition is essential, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions or those experiencing significant weight loss.\n\nEffective management of TBM requires a multidisciplinary approach, including infectious disease specialists, neurologists, and supportive care teams.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nFollow-up care for patients with tuberculous meningitis is essential to monitor treatment response and detect complications:\n\n- Regular Clinical Assessment: Patients should be monitored closely for improvement in neurological status and resolution of symptoms.\n\n- CSF Analysis: Repeat lumbar punctures may be necessary to evaluate the response to treatment, particularly if there is clinical deterioration.\n\n- Imaging Studies: Follow-up neuroimaging may be warranted to assess for complications such as hydrocephalus or new infarcts.\n\n- Long-Term Monitoring: Patients should be followed for potential long-term neurological sequelae, which can include cognitive deficits, motor weakness, and ongoing seizures.\n\nPrognosis varies based on the timeliness of diagnosis and initiation of treatment, as well as the extent of neurological involvement at presentation.\n\n## 8.
