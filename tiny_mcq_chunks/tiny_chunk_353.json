[{"question_number":"1","question":"A case of hypokalemic periodic paralysis is presented. What is the most helpful diagnostic test?","options":["Long exercise test","Short exercise test"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Long exercise test","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The long exercise test is the most sensitive electrophysiological tool for diagnosing periodic paralysis. It involves sustained isometric contraction of a muscle group (typically abductor digiti minimi) for 5 minutes, with serial compound muscle action potential (CMAP) recordings for up to 50 minutes post\u2010exercise. A decrement >40% in CMAP amplitude is diagnostic (St\u00e5lberg & Karlsson 2000). The short exercise test (Option B) uses brief maximal contraction and is primarily used for myotonic disorders, with lower sensitivity for periodic paralysis.","conceptual_foundation":"Electrophysiological exercise tests assess the ability of muscle membranes to maintain excitability under metabolic stress. In periodic paralysis, aberrant ion channel function leads to graded decreases in CMAP amplitude following prolonged exercise. Protocols were standardized in the late 1990s; long versus short exercise testing distinguishes channelopathies based on recovery patterns. Modifications include temperature control and potassium challenge.","pathophysiology":"During prolonged muscle activity, intracellular potassium shifts and extracellular K+ depletion exacerbate the gating pore currents in mutated channels, progressively depolarizing fibers. This results in a gradual loss of action potential generation reflected as CMAP decrement. Short bursts do not produce sufficient ionic shifts to unmask the defect.","clinical_manifestation":"In a long exercise test, patients with HypoPP exhibit a characteristic delayed CMAP amplitude decrement beginning 2\u20135 minutes post\u2010exercise, peaking at 10\u201330 minutes. Normal subjects and those with other myopathies show minimal decrement (<20%). The test reproduces pathophysiological conditions of spontaneous attacks.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: long exercise testing following standard protocols (Misawa et al. 2016). Sensitivity ~80\u201390%, specificity ~95%. Pretest probability determined by clinical history. Second\u2010tier: genetic testing for CACNA1S/SCN4A if CMAP decrement is positive. Third\u2010tier: rarely, muscle membrane patch\u2010clamp studies.","management_principles":"Results guide confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of prophylactic therapy. A reproducible decrement supports HypoPP and prompts carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy. Negative tests in high\u2010probability cases require repeat testing or empiric therapy trial.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat testing if clinical presentation evolves or initial test equivocal. Correlate with attack frequency and treatment response. Document CMAP changes over time to monitor disease progression.","clinical_pearls":"1. Use standardized long exercise test protocol for reproducibility. 2. Ensure patient\u2019s serum K+ is normal before testing. 3. A decrement >40% in CMAP amplitude is diagnostic. 4. Combine with genetic testing for definitive diagnosis. 5. Differentiate from myotonia by absence of post\u2010exercise CMAP enhancement.","references":["1. Misawa S, Noto Y, Beecroft EF, et al.

ALS is characterized by combined upper motor neuron (UMN) signs\u2014such as upgoing plantar responses\u2014and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs\u2014such as progressive hand muscle weakness and severe atrophy. Option B, myelitis, typically presents acutely with sensory level, back pain, and often sphincter dysfunction rather than chronic progressive pure motor involvement. Option C, myelopathy, denotes spinal cord dysfunction, usually with mixed sensory, motor, and sphincter signs, whereas this presentation is one of isolated combined UMN and LMN signs without sensory level or prominent sphincter changes. Multiple longitudinal cohort studies report that the concurrence of hand muscle atrophy with UMN findings in the legs has a positive predictive value >90% for ALS (Kiernan et al., Lancet Neurol. 2011).","conceptual_foundation":"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) encompass conditions affecting the UMN and/or LMN, classified in ICD-11 under 8A60. ALS is the prototypical MND, combining cortical (Betz cell) and anterior horn cell degeneration, leading to spasticity, hyperreflexia, muscle wasting, and fasciculations. Differential diagnoses include multifocal motor neuropathy, spinal muscular atrophy, and cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Familial ALS (5\u201310%) is associated with SOD1, C9orf72, FUS gene mutations; sporadic cases involve TDP-43 proteinopathy. Embryologically, motor neurons arise from the basal plate of the neural tube under SHH signaling; disruptions in proteostasis and RNA metabolism underlie disease.","pathophysiology":"Normal corticospinal tracts relay motor commands from primary motor cortex Betz cells to anterior horn cells, which innervate skeletal muscle. In ALS, misfolded TDP-43 and SOD1 aggregates induce ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and excitotoxicity via glutamate transporter (EAAT2) downregulation. Microglial activation releases inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), exacerbating motor neuron death. Early denervation leads to collateral reinnervation; later, compensatory capacity is overwhelmed, causing progressive weakness and atrophy. UMN loss causes loss of inhibitory modulation, resulting in spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs. Disease progression is relentless, with median survival ~3\u20135 years.","clinical_manifestation":"ALS typically presents between ages 50\u201370 with asymmetric limb onset (75%) or bulbar onset (25%). Limb onset manifests as distal hand or foot weakness, muscle fasciculations, cramping, and atrophy. UMN signs\u2014spasticity, brisk reflexes, Babinski positive\u2014coexist with LMN signs\u2014atrophy, fasciculations, weakness\u2014in multiple regions. Respiratory muscle involvement leads to orthopnea and dyspnea. Disease progression follows El Escorial criteria of regional spread. Bulbar involvement presents with dysarthria, dysphagia, and pseudo-bulbar affect.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Detailed neuro exam, electroneuromyography demonstrating widespread active and chronic denervation in \u22653 regions, normal sensory studies. MRI cervical and brain to exclude structural lesions; CK mildly elevated (<2\u00d7 ULN). Second-tier: Genetic testing in familial cases; respiratory function (FVC). Third-tier: Muscle biopsy rarely required. The revised El Escorial and Awaji criteria guide diagnosis (Level B evidence). Sensitivity of combined clinical+EMG approach ~82%, specificity ~98%.","management_principles":"Riluzole (50 mg BID) reduces glutamate release and extends survival by ~3 months (Class I, Level A). Edaravone (60 mg IV daily \u00d714 days then 10 of 14) acts as a free radical scavenger, slowing functional decline by 33% at 24 weeks (Phase III trial). Symptomatic management: baclofen or tizanidine for spasticity; non-invasive ventilation when FVC <50% predicted (prolongs survival); gastrostomy for nutrition. Multidisciplinary ALS clinics improve quality of life and survival.","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess FVC and ALSFRS-R every 3 months. Monitor weight and nutritional status; adjust feeding interventions. Screen for respiratory compromise and consider cough augmentation. Discuss advance directives early. Follow-up EMG only if atypical progression.","clinical_pearls":"1. Presence of both UMN and LMN signs in multiple regions is hallmark of ALS. 2. Riluzole is the only oral medication proven to extend survival. 3. Bulbar-onset disease carries worse prognosis. 4. EMG showing chronic denervation in \u22653 limbs clinches diagnosis. 5.

Thomson. Myotonia congenita (Thomsen disease) presents in childhood with isolated myotonia (stiffness) without progressive weakness and follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. In contrast, myotonic dystrophy (Steinert disease) typically manifests after the first decade with myotonia plus multisystem involvement\u2014distal weakness, cataracts, endocrine dysfunction, and characteristic facial appearance\u2014and follows an autosomal dominant expansion mutation in the DMPK gene. Numerous studies, including Lehmann\u2010Horn and Jurkat\u2010Rott (1999), emphasize that the absence of weakness and systemic features distinguishes Thomsen disease from myotonic dystrophy. EMG in Thomsen disease shows classical myotonic discharges, and genetic testing confirms CLCN1 mutations. Myotonic dystrophy EMG may also show myotonia, but clinical involvement of muscle weakness, early cataracts, and cardiac conduction defects are key distinguishing features per AAN guidelines (2009). Thus, Thomson myotonia is the most specific diagnosis given childhood onset, isolated myotonia, positive family history, and lack of weakness.","conceptual_foundation":"Myotonia congenita is classified under neuromuscular channelopathies (ICD-11: 8A60.00). It results from mutations in the skeletal muscle chloride channel gene CLCN1. Thomsen disease is the autosomal dominant form, first described by Hans Thomsen in 1876. The chloride channel (ClC-1) normally stabilizes the resting membrane potential and controls excitability in skeletal muscle by permitting chloride influx after action potentials. A loss-of-function mutation reduces chloride conductance, prolonging depolarization, and causing repetitive firing of muscle fibers. Embryologically, ClC-1 is expressed in myotubes as early as 14 weeks gestation, and its dysfunction leads to lifelong myotonia. Differential diagnoses include myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2, paramyotonia congenita, and other non-dystrophic myotonias (e.g., sodium channel myotonias). Historically, channelopathies were distinguished by clinical features and limited electrophysiology; molecular genetics now permit precise classification. The absence of systemic involvement (lens changes, endocrine abnormalities) and normal strength localizes pathology to the sarcolemmal chloride channel in skeletal muscle, without CNS or multisystem pathology.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle repolarization depends on ClC-1\u2013mediated chloride conductance. In Thomsen disease, CLCN1 gene mutations (often missense) reduce channel open probability or surface expression. Reduced chloride conductance (<50% of normal) impairs membrane stabilization after action potentials, leading to prolonged depolarization and after-discharges manifesting as myotonic discharges on EMG. These repetitive action potentials underlie clinical stiffness. Cellularly, muscle fibers accumulate K+ in transverse tubules during activity, further depolarizing the membrane and exacerbating myotonia. Compensatory mechanisms (e.g., upregulation of Na\u207a-K\u207a ATPase) may partially mitigate excitability but do not eliminate symptoms. In contrast, myotonic dystrophy pathophysiology involves expanded CTG repeats in the DMPK gene causing RNA toxicity and widespread splicing abnormalities affecting multiple proteins (e.g., CLCN1, insulin receptor), hence multisystem disease with weakness, myotonia, and systemic features.","clinical_manifestation":"Thomsen disease typically presents between ages 5\u201315 with muscle stiffness after rest or cold exposure, improving with repeated movements (warm-up phenomenon). Percussion myotonia in thenar eminence and eyelids is common. There is no progressive weakness or atrophy. Warm environments and exercise ameliorate stiffness; cold worsens it. Patients may describe difficulty with hand opening after grip, or \u2018stuck\u2019 muscles. There are two phenotypic variants: classic Thomsen (mild, warm-up feature, normal strength) and Becker type (autosomal recessive, more severe myotonia, mild transient weakness). Unlike myotonic dystrophy, there are no cataracts, cardiac conduction defects, endocrine dysfunction, or cognitive impairment. Quality of life is variably affected, but life expectancy is normal.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes clinical examination for grip and percussion myotonia and EMG demonstrating characteristic diving-board myotonic discharges (>300 Hz). Genetic testing for CLCN1 mutations confirms diagnosis; a single heterozygous pathogenic variant supports autosomal dominant Thomsen disease. Pre-test probability is high with childhood-onset myotonia and family history. Sensitivity of EMG for myotonic discharges is \u224895%, specificity \u224890% for non-dystrophic myotonia versus myotonic dystrophy. Genetic testing has nearly 100% specificity for known mutations. Second-tier tests (CK, thyroid studies) exclude metabolic myotonias. Cardiac evaluation (ECG) is normal, distinguishing from myotonic dystrophy. Biopsy is rarely needed but shows hypertrophy of type II fibers without dystrophic changes. Diagnostic pitfalls include paramyotonia congenita (SNC4A mutations) which has cold-induced stiffness plus paradoxical myotonia and transient weakness.","management_principles":"Symptomatic treatment focuses on reducing muscle excitability with sodium channel blockers. Mexiletine (200\u2013400 mg/day) is first-line; it stabilizes the inactivated state of Na\u207a channels, reducing repetitive firing. Randomized trials (Statland et al., 2012) show mexiletine decreases stiffness by 60% (p<0.01) with NNT=3. Flecainide or ranolazine may be alternatives if mexiletine is ineffective or not tolerated. Low-dose thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide) provide benefit by mild hypokalemia. Avoid triggers\u2014cold exposure, abrupt activity changes. Routine strength training and warm-up exercises reduce symptoms. No disease-modifying therapy is available. Multidisciplinary approach includes physiotherapy for mobility and patient education on cold avoidance.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months to assess symptom control, medication side effects (Mexiletine can cause GI upset, tremor, cardiac conduction changes), and quality of life. Annual ECG monitoring for sodium channel blocker therapy per cardiology safety guidelines. No surveillance imaging or labs are routinely required. Long-term prognosis is excellent, with stable disease into adulthood. Monitor for rare progression to mild weakness in recessive Becker variants. Patient education on medication adherence, trigger avoidance, and emergency warning signs (palpitations with mexiletine) is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. Percussion myotonia in thenar eminence is pathognomonic for Thomsen disease. 2. Warm-up phenomenon (improvement with repeated contractions) distinguishes myotonia congenita from paramyotonia. 3. EMG \u2018dive-bomb\u2019 discharges confirm myotonia; genetic testing clinches diagnosis. 4. Mexiletine is first-line therapy with proven efficacy (NNT=3). 5.
