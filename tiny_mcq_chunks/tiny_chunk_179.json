What is the most likely deficiency?","options":["Thiamine","Flumazenil"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Thiamine","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Thiamine) is correct. Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy in alcoholics presents with ataxia, confusion, and halitosis due to ketone breath; ocular signs may be absent in 20\u201330% of cases (Harper et al. 2018). Thiamine deficiency explains the subacute cerebellar and encephalopathic findings. Flumazenil (Option B) reverses benzodiazepines, not relevant here and not a deficiency state.","conceptual_foundation":"Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy is due to deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1), a coenzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. ICD-11 classifies it under 6C8Y. Differential diagnoses include alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, hepatic encephalopathy, and Korsakoff syndrome. Historical descriptions by Wernicke (1881) and Korsakoff established the acute encephalopathy and chronic amnestic syndrome.","pathophysiology":"Thiamine deficiency impairs cerebral glucose metabolism, leading to focal lesions in mammillary bodies, thalamus, and cerebellar vermis. Accumulation of lactate and glutamate causes excitotoxicity and BBB breakdown. The cerebellar vermis is vulnerable, causing ataxia; thalamic involvement causes confusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic triad: confusion (82%), ataxia (44%), ocular signs (29%). Halitosis (\u2018ketone breath\u2019) may reflect malnutrition and ketosis. Ocular signs (nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia) may be absent, particularly in chronic alcoholics. Without treatment, progression to Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome occurs.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical; measure erythrocyte transketolase activity (sensitivity 0.85). MRI can show symmetric T2 hyperintensities in mammillary bodies (sensitivity 0.53, specificity 0.93). Pre-test probability is high in malnourished alcoholics with ataxia and encephalopathy.","management_principles":"Empiric high-dose parenteral thiamine (500 mg IV TID for 2\u20133 days, then 250 mg IV daily) per EFNS guidelines. Followed by oral supplementation (100 mg daily). Flumazenil is contraindicated and irrelevant.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical improvement over days; continue thiamine until nutritional status improves. MRI changes may resolve over weeks. Neuropsychological testing at 3\u20136 months to assess for Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome.","clinical_pearls":"1. Wernicke\u2019s can lack ocular signs in up to 30%. 2. Ataxia and confusion in alcoholics = treat thiamine first. 3. Halitosis reflects ketosis and malnutrition. 4. Flumazenil is not indicated. 5.

What is the likely culprit medication?","options":["Efavirenz"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Efavirenz","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Efavirenz is well\u2010recognized to cause central nervous system adverse effects including dizziness, vivid dreams, insomnia, mood changes, and in rare cases seizures due to lowering of the seizure threshold. No other antiretroviral routinely induces seizures; thus option A is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that readily crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier. It acts on neurotransmitter receptors (e.g., GABA-A) and modulates serotonin transport, which can precipitate neuropsychiatric symptoms and rare seizure events.","pathophysiology":"By antagonizing GABAergic transmission and altering glutamatergic pathways, efavirenz reduces inhibitory tone in the CNS. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2B6 can elevate drug levels, further increasing neurotoxicity risk.","clinical_manifestation":"Approximately 50% of patients experience CNS side effects, most mild; seizures occur in <1\u20132% of users, often in context of overdose or drug\u2013drug interactions elevating plasma levels.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluate new-onset seizure in an HIV patient on efavirenz by measuring drug levels, reviewing concomitant medications, performing EEG to exclude other etiologies, and neuroimaging to rule out opportunistic infections or mass lesions.","management_principles":"If efavirenz\u2013induced seizure is suspected, switch to an alternative regimen (e.g., integrase inhibitor) and initiate anticonvulsant therapy if indicated. Monitor for drug\u2013drug interactions with antiepileptics.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess neuropsychiatric status after switching ART, adjust antiepileptics based on seizure recurrence, and consult neurology for chronic seizure management.","clinical_pearls":"1. Efavirenz lowers seizure threshold via GABA-A antagonism. 2. Slow CYP2B6 metabolizers have higher toxicity risk. 3. Dolutegravir is a preferred alternative with fewer CNS effects. 4. Monitor for interactions with enzyme\u2010inducing antiepileptics. 5. Always rule out CNS infection in HIV patients presenting with seizures.","references":"1. Marzolini C, et al.

He has pale bands over his nails. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Gold","Lead","Arsenic"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Arsenic","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option C (Arsenic) is correct. Chronic arsenic exposure classically causes small-fiber peripheral neuropathy characterized by numbness, paresthesia, and pain in a stocking-glove distribution. Mee\u2019s lines (transverse white bands) on the nails are pathognomonic for arsenic poisoning. Lead (option B) causes a motor neuropathy with wrist/foot drop and Burton\u2019s lines on the gingiva, not nail bands. Gold (option A) can induce membranous nephropathy and rarely neuropathy, but is not associated with Mee\u2019s lines.","conceptual_foundation":"Arsenic exists in organic and inorganic forms, with inorganic arsenic trioxide being the most neurotoxic. Exposures occur via contaminated groundwater, pesticides, or industrial processes. ICD-11 classifies arsenic poisoning under toxic effects of metals, and the neuropathy falls under 6E40.2 small fiber neuropathy. Differential diagnoses include diabetic neuropathy, B12 deficiency, and other toxin-induced neuropathies.","pathophysiology":"Arsenic interferes with cellular respiration by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase and lipoic acid\u2013dependent enzymes, leading to ATP depletion and oxidative stress. Peripheral small fibers are particularly vulnerable. Nail matrix melanocytes and keratinocytes are affected, producing Mee\u2019s lines due to disrupted keratinization during periods of poisoning.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset is subacute over weeks to months. Patients report distal burning, tingling, and allodynia. On examination, small-fiber modalities (pain, temperature) are reduced with preserved vibration/proprioception. Mee\u2019s lines transverse the nail and migrate distally over time. Autonomic features (orthostatic hypotension, GI dysmotility) may occur.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on arsenic levels in urine (acute: >50 \u00b5g/L) or hair/nail analysis for chronic exposure. Nerve conduction studies show normal large-fiber conduction with reduced small-fiber function on quantitative sensory testing. Skin biopsy may confirm reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density.","management_principles":"Chelation with dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) or DMSA is first-line. Discontinue exposure and provide symptomatic treatment (gabapentinoids, SNRIs for neuropathic pain). Monitor renal/hepatic function during chelation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor urinary arsenic levels weekly until normalized. Repeat nerve conduction and skin biopsy at 6\u201312 months. Symptom resolution may take months to years, and some deficits may be permanent.","clinical_pearls":"1. Mee\u2019s lines on nails: arsenic. 2. Inorganic arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase. 3. Chelation with dimercaprol is first line. 4. Small-fiber neuropathy: burning pain, normal large-fiber NCS. 5. Check groundwater sources in endemic areas.","references":"1. Ratnaike RN.
