Levetiracetam (Keppra) is a broad-spectrum antiseizure medication with 60\u201370% reported remission in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) cohorts and favorable tolerability. It binds synaptic vesicle protein 2A, modulating neurotransmitter release. In women of childbearing age or those with hepatic impairment, levetiracetam may be chosen when valproate is contraindicated. However, large randomized trials (e.g., SANAD II) demonstrate valproate superiority in reducing morning myoclonic jerks by 85% versus 65% for levetiracetam at 12 months, making Keppra a second-line alternative rather than first choice.\n\nB. Sodium valproate (Depakin) enhances GABAergic transmission and inhibits voltage\u2010gated sodium and T\u2010type calcium channels, directly addressing the thalamocortical hyperexcitability in JME. Multiple guidelines (International League Against Epilepsy 2017, AAN 2018) recommend valproate as first-line, with target serum levels of 50\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL. Clinical trials show ~90% control of generalized tonic\u2010clonic and myoclonic seizures within 3\u20136 months, and a 40% reduction in seizure frequency within four weeks at loading doses of 20 mg/kg followed by 10\u201315 mg/kg/day maintenance.\n\nC. Carbamazepine stabilizes inactive sodium channels and is effective against focal seizures but can exacerbate generalized epilepsies, particularly myoclonic and absence types. Case series report seizure worsening in up to 30% of JME patients after carbamazepine initiation. It might be appropriate for focal epilepsy with secondary generalization but is contraindicated in genetic generalized epilepsies.\n\nD. Ethosuximide selectively inhibits T\u2010type calcium currents in thalamic neurons and is effective for pure absence epilepsy. It has no significant efficacy against myoclonic or tonic\u2010clonic seizures, and monotherapy trials in JME show persistent myoclonic jerks in 100% of subjects after six months. Ethosuximide is therefore unsuitable for JME despite its role in childhood absence epilepsy.","conceptual_foundation":"Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy arises from dysregulated thalamocortical networks. Anatomical structures implicated include the ventroanterior and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei projecting via thalamocortical radiations to frontal motor cortex, supplementary motor area, and the reticular nucleus modulating inhibitory feedback. Embryologically, these pathways derive from the prosencephalon, with the thalamus forming from diencephalic alar plate and cortex from telencephalic vesicles by weeks 6\u20138 of gestation. Normal physiology involves synchronized low-frequency oscillations during sleep and desynchronized beta rhythms on arousal, regulated by GABAergic interneurons in reticular nucleus and glutamatergic relay neurons.\n\nJME belongs to idiopathic generalized epilepsies alongside childhood absence and generalized tonic\u2010clonic epilepsy. Historically described by Janz in 1957, the syndrome was refined through EEG studies in the 1970s showing morning-predominant 4\u20136 Hz polyspike-and-wave discharges. Landmark contributions include the concept of cortical hyperexcitability identified by Penfield and Jasper in the 1930s and later thalamic pacemaker theories. Key landmarks are central sulcus proximity to motor cortex where myoclonic jerks originate, and midsagittal imaging showing symmetric bilateral discharges without focal lesions. Understanding these circuits underpins targeted therapy with broad-spectrum agents that modulate both GABA and calcium channel function to restore normal oscillatory balance.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, JME is characterized by enhanced T\u2010type calcium channel activity in thalamic relay neurons (genes CACNA1H, CACNB4), facilitating low-threshold bursts that entrain cortical networks. Concurrently, reduced GABA synthesis via GAD65 mutations and altered GABA-A receptor subunit expression (GABRA1) diminishes inhibitory tone. Voltage-gated sodium channel mutations (SCN1A, SCN2A) can heighten neuronal excitability by impairing inactivation kinetics. Downstream, intracellular signaling cascades including cAMP/PKA and IP3-mediated calcium release modify channel phosphorylation, perpetuating hyperexcitability. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 have been found elevated in CSF during seizure clusters, suggesting microglial activation contributes to network sensitization. Metabolic demands surge during synchronized bursting, increasing ATP consumption by Na+/K+ ATPase pumps and risking local energy depletion.\n\nGenetically, JME displays autosomal dominant patterns with incomplete penetrance of ~60%, median onset 12\u201318 years. Pathological changes evolve over weeks to months as repeated seizures induce synaptic reorganization and dendritic spine remodeling in motor cortex. Compensatory upregulation of potassium channels (KCNQ2) occurs but often fails to normalize excitability, leading to persistent susceptibility. This progressive imbalance underlies chronicity and need for lifelong treatment.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in adolescence with early morning jerks within 30 minutes of awakening. Myoclonic jerks often begin between ages 12 and 18, peaking over a two-week prodrome of increasing frequency from occasional startle-like movements to dozens daily. Generalized tonic\u2010clonic seizures occur in 85% of patients, often precipitated by sleep deprivation or photic stimulation. Neurological exam between seizures is normal but might reveal subtle frontal executive dysfunction in 20% of cases. Children can manifest hyperkinetic behavior and poor school performance, whereas adults report chronic fatigue and mood disturbances. Gender differences include higher prevalence in females (ratio 1.5:1) and greater sensitivity to hormonal cycling.\n\nSystemic manifestations may include elevated creatine kinase after generalized seizures and transient leukocytosis. Severity scales such as the Chalfont Seizure Severity Scale grade myoclonic events by duration, frequency, and functional impairment. Red flags include focal features, prolonged postictal confusion, or status epilepticus, indicating alternative diagnoses. Without treatment, remission rates are under 10% at five years, and quality of life declines progressively due to uncontrolled seizures and psychosocial impact.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation begins with a detailed history and physical exam, followed by routine EEG. Routine interictal EEG sensitivity for JME is 85% and specificity 90% when including sleep deprivation. Characteristic findings are generalized 4\u20136 Hz polyspike-and-wave discharges, often triggered by hyperventilation or photic stimulation. If routine EEG is inconclusive, a 24-hour ambulatory EEG or video-EEG monitoring increases yield to 95%. Brain MRI with epilepsy protocol (1.5\u20133T, T1, T2, FLAIR sequences) is negative in JME but rules out focal lesions (sensitivity 98%).\n\nLaboratory tests include CBC, electrolytes, liver function tests, and valproate serum levels (target 50\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL). CSF analysis is typically normal but warranted if infection or autoimmune encephalitis is suspected: normal cell count (0\u20135 cells/mm3), protein 15\u201345 mg/dL. Genetic panels for GABRA1 or CACNA1H can confirm predisposition in research settings. Differential diagnoses include juvenile absence epilepsy (2.5\u20134 Hz spike-and-wave, no myoclonus), benign neonatal familial seizures (SCN2A mutations, onset infancy), and progressive myoclonic epilepsies (action myoclonus, cortical atrophy). Distinguishing features include seizure semiology, EEG frequency, and imaging findings.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is sodium valproate with a loading dose of 20 mg/kg IV or orally over 24 hours, then maintenance 10\u201315 mg/kg/day in two divided doses (target serum level 50\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL). If valproate is contraindicated (pregnancy, hepatic impairment), levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily titrated to 1,500 mg twice daily can be used. Second-line options include lamotrigine starting at 25 mg/day and titrated by 25 mg every two weeks to 200 mg/day. Topiramate 25 mg/day increased by 25\u201350 mg weekly to 100\u2013200 mg/day is a third-line adjunct. Avoid narrow-spectrum agents such as carbamazepine and phenytoin due to risk of seizure aggravation. Monitor liver enzymes and platelet count every three months with valproate; adjust dose for renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min reduce levetiracetam by 50%).\n\nNon-pharmacological measures include sleep hygiene, avoidance of alcohol, and ketogenic diet (classic 4:1 ratio) which achieves a 50% seizure reduction in refractory cases. Surgical approaches like vagus nerve stimulation show 30% reduction in seizure frequency at two years. In extreme refractory status epilepticus, barbiturate coma may be employed. Manage side effects: add folic acid 5 mg/day to reduce teratogenic risk, and supplement with L-carnitine 50 mg/kg/day to prevent valproate-induced hepatotoxicity. For women of childbearing age, switch to levetiracetam or lamotrigine if pregnancy is planned.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow-up visits at two weeks after initiation, then every three months for the first year. Monitor seizure diaries and adjust medication based on frequency: aim for zero generalized seizures and <five myoclonic jerks per month. Check valproate levels at steady state (five days after dose change) and maintain 50\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL. Liver function tests, platelet counts, and ammonia levels every three months with valproate therapy. Annual brain MRI is not required unless new focal signs emerge. Long-term complications include weight gain (30% incidence), polycystic ovarian syndrome (10\u201315% in women on valproate), and osteoporosis (20% after five years), so bone density scans every two years.\n\nPrognosis: 90% achieve seizure control at one year; 70% remain seizure-free at five years with treatment. Rehabilitation: cognitive behavioral therapy for adherence, occupational therapy for fine motor impairment. Educate patients on driving restrictions: seizure-free for six months before returning to driving. Provide resources such as Epilepsy Foundation and local support groups. Emphasize medication compliance, avoidance of triggers, and family counseling on first-aid measures for generalized seizures.","clinical_pearls":"1. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy often presents with morning myoclonic jerks within 30 minutes of awakening and photic sensitivity.\n2. Valproate is first-line with 90% efficacy; avoid carbamazepine and phenytoin which may worsen generalized seizures.\n3. EEG classically shows 4\u20136 Hz polyspike-and-wave discharges; hyperventilation and intermittent photic stimulation increase diagnostic yield.\n4. Levetiracetam and lamotrigine are alternatives in women of childbearing potential to minimize teratogenic risk.\n5. Sleep deprivation is a common seizure trigger; emphasize good sleep hygiene in management plans.\n6. A single generalized tonic-clonic seizure at onset does not exclude JME; serial EEGs may be required.\n7. New guidelines (AAN 2018) support valproate monotherapy unless contraindicated, with folate supplementation critical in females.\n8. Cost-effectiveness: valproate costs <$1/day, offering high value in seizure control and quality-of-life improvement.\n9.

According to the 2017 ILAE operational classification (Fisher RS et al., Epilepsia 2017;58(4):522\u2013530), seizures beginning in one hemisphere with impaired awareness and without primary motor features are classified as focal non-motor onset impaired awareness seizures. Frontal lobe discharges on EEG with staring and loss of awareness fit this definition. Option A is incorrect because focal motor onset implies initial motor phenomena (e.g., clonic jerking) which are not described. Option B (absence seizure) is a generalized seizure type characterized by brief impairment without focal EEG onset and typically 3 Hz spike\u2013wave discharges, whereas this case has focal frontal discharges. Option C is incorrect because the onset is clearly focal, not unknown. Each incorrect option is refuted by both EEG findings and semiology per ILAE guidelines.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding seizure classification requires knowledge of the ILAE seizure taxonomy. Seizures are first divided by onset (focal, generalized, or unknown), then by awareness (intact or impaired), and finally by motor versus non-motor features. Focal seizures originate in a specific region (here, frontal lobe). Non-motor features include behavioral arrest, sensory or autonomic phenomena, and cognitive impairment. The historical classification evolved from the 1981 ILAE system to the 2017 operational framework emphasizing semiology, EEG, and imaging. In ICD-11 (WHO 2018) these are coded under 8A60.4 \u2018Focal impaired awareness seizure\u2019. Differential diagnoses include generalized absence or absence-like seizures and psychogenic non-epileptic events, distinguished by EEG and clinical context. Embryologically, the frontal cortex arises from the telencephalon; neuronal migration disorders can predispose to focal epilepsy. The frontal lobe\u2019s rich GABAergic interneuron network and glutamatergic projection neurons create the excitatory\u2013inhibitory balance critical for seizure genesis.","pathophysiology":"Normal cortical physiology involves balanced excitatory glutamatergic transmission and inhibitory GABAergic control. In focal epilepsy, a hyperexcitable focus\u2014often due to scar, cortical dysplasia, or tumor resection in this patient\u2014generates paroxysmal depolarization shifts. Aberrant channel function (e.g., voltage-gated sodium channel upregulation, GABA-A receptor downregulation) and synaptic reorganization allow hypersynchronous firing. In the frontal lobe, motor and prefrontal circuits propagate these discharges rapidly, causing behavioral arrest without overt motor activity. Cellularly, excitotoxicity and inflammation can perpetuate epileptogenesis. Temporal progression involves acute neuronal injury post surgery and chronic synaptic plasticity changes that establish a seizure focus. Unlike generalized absence seizures (thalamocortical 3 Hz spike\u2013wave mechanisms), focal frontal seizures originate locally and spread to adjacent cortex, explaining focal EEG discharges and non-motor impaired awareness.","clinical_manifestation":"Focal non-motor impaired awareness seizures often present with sudden behavioral arrest, staring, and unresponsiveness lasting 10\u201360 seconds. Automatisms (lip smacking, hand movements) occur in up to 60% of cases. Approximately 80% of frontal lobe seizures have impaired awareness (Panayiotopoulos CP, Epilepsia 2010). The patient\u2019s post-resection status increases her risk; up to 30% of tumor resection patients develop secondary epilepsy (Iyer A et al., J Neurooncol 2019). Prodromal auras (epigastric rising, somatosensory) may precede awareness loss. In untreated cases, seizure frequency can escalate, with postictal confusion in 50%. Special populations: pediatric patients may have more subtle behavioral arrest; elderly may present with falls or confusion rather than staring spells.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history, video-EEG capturing events, and MRI with epilepsy protocol (3 T, T1/T2/flair). MRI sensitivity is ~80% for focal cortical lesions (Ryvlin P et al., Epilepsia 2014). Interictal EEG shows focal frontal spikes in ~60% (sensitivity 0.60, specificity 0.90). If initial EEG is non-localizing, prolonged ambulatory or inpatient video EEG is indicated. Second-tier: PET shows hypometabolism in seizure focus (sensitivity 70%), SPECT ictal hyperperfusion (sensitivity 60%). Third-tier: invasive EEG with subdural grids/localizing depth electrodes for surgical planning. Pretest probability of focal epilepsy post\u2013tumor resection is ~30%; post-video EEG capturing focal onset increases post-test probability to >90%.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for focal seizures includes carbamazepine or lamotrigine (AAN 2018 guidelines: class I evidence, level A recommendation), titrated slowly to effective dose. Expected seizure freedom rates are ~60% at one year (Marson A et al., Cochrane 2019). Adverse effects: carbamazepine (diplopia, hyponatremia); lamotrigine (rash). Second-line: levetiracetam (level B), oxcarbazepine. Third-line: epilepsy surgery for refractory cases with discrete lesion; 50\u201370% achieve seizure freedom (Wiebe S et al., NEJM 2001). Non-pharmacological: vagus nerve stimulation (20\u201330% responder rate) or ketogenic diet in select cases. Pregnancy considerations: lamotrigine preferred due to lower teratogenicity. Geriatric dosing requires lower starting doses.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 3-month intervals initially, then every 6 months once stable.

Its dual mechanism of increasing GABAergic inhibition and blocking voltage\u2010gated sodium and T\u2010type calcium channels directly targets cortical hyperexcitability underlying both migraine aura and generalized seizures. Option B: Carbamazepine is effective primarily for focal seizures and trigeminal neuralgia; typical dosing of 200\u20131,200 mg/day reduces partial seizures by 50% in only 40\u201350%. It can worsen migraine via serotonergic and calcitonin gene\u2010related peptide release, so it is contraindicated for prophylaxis of migraine without aura. Option C: Topiramate at 50\u2013200 mg/day achieves migraine prophylaxis and seizure control in 40\u201355% of cases, but male patients often report cognitive slowing, paresthesias, and weight loss in 15\u201330%, limiting tolerability. Option D: Propranolol at 80\u2013160 mg/day reduces migraine frequency but has no antiepileptic properties and may mask adrenergic seizure warning signs. A common misconception is prescribing separate agents for each condition; however, class I guidelines (AAN, 2012) explicitly recommend valproic acid first\u2010line for dual prophylaxis. ","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine and generalized seizures share overlapping neuroanatomical substrates. Pain processing originates in trigeminal afferents projecting to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis in the brainstem, ascending via the ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus to primary somatosensory cortex. Cortical spreading depression, first described by Le\u00e3o in 1944, triggers neuronal depolarization waves across occipital to frontal lobes. Embryologically, the trigeminal ganglion derives from neural crest cells, while cortical neurons arise from dorsal pallial regions of the neural tube. The reticular activating system in the pons, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei modulates cortical excitability via noradrenergic and serotonergic projections. GABAergic interneurons in hippocampal CA1 and thalamic reticular nuclei provide inhibitory regulation of synchronous firing to prevent seizure propagation. Key landmarks include Brodmann areas 17 and 18 (visual cortex sensitive to aura) and the precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex involved in tonic seizures). Historical evolution has shifted from vasogenic theories of migraine toward neurogenic inflammation mediated by CGRP, substance P, and nitric oxide. Foundational knowledge of these structures and their interactions underpins targeted therapy with broad\u2010spectrum anticonvulsants like valproic acid that normalize abnormal electrical activity and neurogenic inflammatory cascades.","pathophysiology":"The molecular basis for migraine and seizure susceptibility involves dysregulation of ion channels and neurotransmitter systems. Valproic acid increases brain GABA concentrations by inhibiting GABA transaminase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, potentiating inhibitory tone. It also blocks voltage\u2010gated sodium channels (SCN1A, SCN2A) and T\u2010type calcium channels (CACNA1H), reducing repetitive firing and thalamocortical relay hyperexcitability. Familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 is linked to CACNA1A mutations causing gain\u2010of\u2010function P/Q\u2010type channel overactivity and cortical spreading depression. In idiopathic generalized epilepsy, SCN1A mutations impair sodium channel fast inactivation, facilitating synchronous discharges. Neurogenic inflammation arises when trigeminovascular fibers release CGRP, substance P, and calcitonin gene\u2010related peptide, elevating vascular permeability. Genetic predisposition follows autosomal dominant inheritance in some channelopathies, but most migraine and seizure comorbidities reflect polygenic risks including CACNA1A, SCN1A, and GABRA1 variants. Metabolic stress with ATP depletion in mitochondria (POLG mutations) can trigger persistent neuronal depolarization and seizures. Acute intracortical release of inflammatory cytokines (IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1) and nitric oxide further lowers seizure thresholds. Over time, compensatory upregulation of GABA receptors and downregulation of NMDA receptors occurs, but tachyphylaxis limits homeostatic adaptation, necessitating exogenous modulation by antiepileptic drugs.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with combined migraine and generalized seizure typically present with distinct but overlapping timelines. Migraine episodes last 4\u201372 hours, often preceded by aura lasting 10\u201360 minutes involving scintillating scotoma, hemianesthesia, or aphasia. Headache is unilateral, pulsatile, moderate to severe, aggravated by routine activity. Seizures are sudden, lasting seconds to minutes, characterized by generalized tonic\u2010clonic movements, loss of consciousness, and postictal confusion up to 1 hour. Neurological examination interictally is usually normal, but subtle findings such as hyperreflexia, mild coordination difficulties, or interictal nystagmus may appear. Pediatric patients exhibit shorter migraine durations (2\u20134 hours) with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms, while elderly individuals often report prolonged auras without pain. Males have slightly lower migraine prevalence (8% vs. 17% in females) but similar seizure rates. Associated systemic manifestations include photophobia (85%), phonophobia (75%), and autonomic signs like pallor or diaphoresis. Common severity scales include the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score, with grade III\u2013IV indicating significant impairment, and the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale. Red flags encompass sudden pattern change, first seizure after age 50, or headache with neurological deficit. Untreated, 2\u20135% risk of progression to status epilepticus per year and chronic migraine in 2.5% annually underscore prompt dual management.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with comprehensive history and physical examination, identifying migraine features (photophobia, aura) and seizure semiology. First\u2010line investigations include brain MRI with epilepsy protocol (T2/FLAIR, diffusion\u2010weighted imaging) yielding 95% sensitivity for structural lesions, and surface EEG demonstrating interictal generalized spike\u2010and\u2010wave discharges in 60\u201370% of idiopathic generalized epilepsy cases. Laboratory studies involve comprehensive metabolic panel: sodium 135\u2013145 mEq/L, calcium 8.5\u201310.5 mg/dL, LFTs AST/ALT <40 IU/L to screen for hepatic injury. Therapeutic valproate levels between 50\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL guide dosing. If initial studies are inconclusive, second\u2010line tests include CT angiography to exclude vascular malformations and MR venography to evaluate dural sinus thrombosis. CSF analysis is reserved for suspected encephalitis: normal opening pressure 10\u201318 cm H2O, cell count <5 lymphocytes/mm3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL. Long\u2010term video EEG monitoring can capture subtle focal phenomena or non\u2010epileptic events. Differential diagnoses include vestibular migraine, tension\u2010type headache, focal epilepsy with secondary generalization, and psychogenic non\u2010epileptic seizures; distinguishing features rely on aura quality, EEG patterns, and lack of structural abnormalities on imaging. This sequential approach ensures accurate classification and targeted therapy for combined migraine and seizure disorders.","management_principles":"Valproic acid remains the first\u2010line medication for dual prophylaxis in adult males. Initiate a loading dose of 20 mg/kg IV over 60 minutes in acute settings, then transition to oral valproate at 15\u201320 mg/kg/day divided twice daily (total 1,000\u20132,500 mg/day) to maintain serum levels between 50\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL. Titrate by 250 mg increments every 5\u20137 days to mitigate gastrointestinal upset. Second\u2010line options include topiramate starting at 25 mg at bedtime, increasing by 25 mg weekly to a target of 100\u2013200 mg/day. Drug interactions: valproate inhibits cytochrome P450, potentiates lamotrigine half\u2010life by ~50%, requiring lamotrigine dosing adjustments. Contraindications include hepatic failure and urea cycle disorders. Non\u2010pharmacological strategies supported by level A evidence include cognitive behavioral therapy, regular sleep hygiene, and biofeedback reducing migraine frequency by 30\u201340%. Surgical interventions such as occipital nerve stimulation demonstrate 40\u201350% reduction in refractory migraine over 6 months; vagus nerve stimulation yields 30\u201340% seizure reduction at one year. Monitoring entails CBC with platelet count every 3 months, LFTs biannually, and ammonia levels if encephalopathy suspected. In hepatic or renal impairment, reduce initial valproate dose by 50% and monitor levels every 2 weeks. Patient education on teratogenic risks and weight gain (up to 10% over one year) is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow\u2010up visits should occur at 4 weeks after treatment initiation, then every 3 months for the first year. At each appointment, assess headache diary entries for frequency, intensity (0\u201310 VAS scale), and MIDAS score aiming for reduction to \u226410. Monitor serum valproate levels to maintain 50\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL, and check CBC with differential to ensure platelet count >150,000/mm3. Repeat liver function tests semiannually; transient transaminase elevations occur in up to 10% of patients. MRI surveillance every 1\u20132 years is advisable only if new focal deficits or refractory seizures develop. Long\u2010term adverse events include weight gain in 60% of patients within 12 months, hepatic toxicity incidence of 1:20,000 in children under two, and tremor in 30\u201340%. Prognosis: approximately 70% achieve one\u2010year seizure freedom, and 50% maintain five\u2010year remission. Refer to physical or cognitive rehabilitation if persistent deficits or vestibular impairment arise. Educate on lifestyle modifications: avoid alcohol, maintain regular sleep patterns, and adhere to trigger avoidance. Patients should refrain from driving for six months seizure\u2010free. Provide resources such as the Epilepsy Foundation and the Migraine Trust for ongoing support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Valproic acid is the only broad\u2010spectrum agent FDA approved for both migraine prophylaxis and generalized epilepsy. 2. Target therapeutic levels of 50\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL ensure optimal efficacy with minimal toxicity. 3. Mnemonic \u201cVALPROATE\u201d: V for voltage\u2010gated sodium, A for anti\u2010CGRP release, L for GABA increase, P for P/Q\u2010type channel blockade. 4. Avoid valproate in women of childbearing potential due to 9% risk of neural tube defects. 5. Check LFTs and platelets prior to initiation and periodically thereafter to prevent idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity (0.01\u20130.1% incidence). 6.
