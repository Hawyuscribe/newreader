[{"question_number":"2","question":"Scenario of a patient with new onset slurred speech and left-sided weakness. Symptoms started in the morning. Brain computed tomography (CT) shows right hemispheric stroke. What is the best next step for blood pressure control?","options":["IV Hydralazine","IV Labetalol","No intervention needed","Oral Amlodipine"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"No intervention needed","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (IV Hydralazine): Intravenous hydralazine is a direct arteriolar vasodilator that may precipitously lower blood pressure and exacerbate ischemic penumbra perfusion deficits. It is reserved for hypertensive emergencies with end-organ damage such as malignant hypertension (diastolic >130 mm Hg) (per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines). In acute ischemic stroke with modest elevations, rapid drops risk infarct expansion. Rarely considered when systolic BP exceeds 220 mm Hg despite Tier 1 measures. Patient\u2019s systolic ~160 mm Hg makes A inappropriate. Option B (IV Labetalol): Labetalol, a combined \u03b1- and \u03b2-blocker, safely lowers BP at 10 \u2013 20 mg IV bolus over 2 minutes with repeat dosing every 10 minutes up to 300 mg (per ESO 2021). It is first-line if BP >185/110 mm Hg prior to thrombolysis or >220/120 mm Hg for non-thrombolysis. Our patient\u2019s BP did not meet these thresholds. Misconception: any elevated BP needs immediate reduction. Option C (No intervention needed): Permissive hypertension supports collateral perfusion until reperfusion therapy or stabilization. Guidelines allow up to 220/120 mm Hg in non-tPA candidates to maintain penumbral flow (per AHA/ASA 2018). Studies show no benefit to treating BP <220/120 and potential harm if reduced prematurely. This pathophysiological rationale confirms C as correct. Option D (Oral Amlodipine): Long-acting dihydropyridine CCB has delayed onset (2 \u2013 4 hours) inappropriate for acute control. Oral agents risk unpredictable absorption in acute stroke and are reserved for subacute management once stabilized (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Common board pitfall: selecting oral agents for immediate BP control.","conceptual_foundation":"In acute right hemispheric ischemic stroke affecting the internal capsule and primary motor cortex, the contralateral corticospinal tract is disrupted, producing left-sided weakness and dysarthria. The internal capsule\u2019s posterior limb carries descending UMN fibers from M1, while adjacent corona radiata fibers contribute to facial and bulbar control. Embryologically, the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) territories derive from the prosencephalon and mesencephalon, respectively, explaining tandem patterns of infarction. Under normal physiology, cerebral autoregulation maintains flow between mean arterial pressures of 60 \u2013 150 mm Hg via myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms. With acute ischemia, autoregulation fails, relying on systemic pressure to perfuse the penumbra. Associated syndromes include pure motor stroke (lacunar MCA branch) and cortical neglect with right parietal involvement. Historically, imaging transitioned from clinical localization by Broca and Wernicke (19th century) to CT in 1973, MRI-DWI in the 1990s, and now perfusion imaging to delineate penumbral tissue. Key landmarks include the sylvian fissure for MCA branches, the hand knob region in precentral gyrus, and the posterior limb of internal capsule visualized on axial CT. Understanding these structures underpins targeted diagnostic evaluation and management.","pathophysiology":"Acute ischemic stroke initiates excitotoxic cascades: glutamate release binds NMDA and AMPA receptors, causing Ca2+ influx and sodium overload, cell swelling, and reactive oxygen species generation. Intracellular calcium activates phospholipases, proteases, and endonucleases, leading to membrane degradation and DNA fragmentation. Genetic predispositions, such as NOTCH3 mutations in CADASIL, enhance small vessel fragility. Inflammatory mediators\u2014TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and microglial activation\u2014amplify blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 degrades extracellular matrix, exacerbating edema. ATP depletion halts Na+/K+-ATPase, further depolarizing neurons. Mitochondrial dysfunction triggers cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Anaerobic glycolysis yields lactate, lowering pH and impairing metabolic enzymes. Compensatory collateral recruitment from leptomeningeal vessels may transiently sustain penumbra but often insufficient beyond 3 \u2013 6 hours. Over days, reactive gliosis and astrocyte scar formation occur. Endothelial cell swelling and pericyte loss contribute to reperfusion injury if abrupt flow restoration occurs. Understanding these cascades informs therapeutic time windows and adjunctive neuroprotective strategies under investigation.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset occurs within minutes of arterial occlusion. Initially, patients report sudden slurred speech and hemiparesis; peak deficits manifest within 1 \u2013 2 hours. In this adult scenario, left arm and leg weakness graded 2/5 on MRC scale and facial droop are noted. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 8 quantifies moderate severity. Children often present with headache or seizures; elderly more commonly exhibit confusion or falls. Men and women show similar focal deficits, though women may report non-specific symptoms like generalized weakness. Systemic signs can include elevated blood pressure (permissive rise to maintain perfusion), hyperglycemia triggering worse outcomes, and atrial fibrillation with irregular pulse. Red flags: rapid deterioration, signs of increased intracranial pressure (vomiting, decreased consciousness). Without treatment, infarct core expands over 24 \u2013 72 hours, maximal edema peaks at 3 \u2013 5 days. Early neurologic deterioration occurs in ~30% of untreated strokes. Recognizing associated dysphagia, neglect, and visual field cuts is critical for tailored therapy and predicting complications such as aspiration pneumonia.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Emergent noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 95% for intracerebral hemorrhage) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: CT angiography of head/neck to identify large-vessel occlusion (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%) per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines. Step 3: CT perfusion or MRI DWI within 6 hours for penumbral assessment (per ESO 2021). Step 4: Laboratory studies: CBC, CMP, coagulation panel (INR 0.8\u20131.2), blood glucose (70\u2013140 mg/dL) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 5: ECG and continuous telemetry to detect atrial fibrillation (per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines). Step 6: Carotid duplex ultrasound if CTA inconclusive; >70% stenosis defined by peak systolic velocity >230 cm/s (per NASCET criteria, 1991). Step 7: Transthoracic echocardiography for cardiac source of emboli (ejection fraction, valvular pathology) per ACC/AHA 2020 guidelines. Differential diagnoses include hypoglycemia (glucose <60 mg/dL), Todd\u2019s paralysis post-seizure, and migraine aura which present with spreading cortical symptoms and normal imaging. Optional lumbar puncture is not indicated unless suspecting vasculitis or infection given normal CT and focal deficits (per AAN 2023 guidelines).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): \u2022 Permissive BP management: No antihypertensive unless >220/120 mm Hg to preserve penumbra (per AHA/ASA 2018). \u2022 IV alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg; 10% bolus over 1 minute, remainder over 60 minutes) within 4.5 hours (per ESO 2021). \u2022 Mechanical thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion within 6 hours (per AHA/ASA 2018). Tier 2 (Second-line): \u2022 Endovascular stent retrievers if tPA contraindicated or beyond window up to 24 hours guided by perfusion (per DAWN/RAPID trials 2018). \u2022 IV tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg bolus if alteplase unavailable (per AHA/ASA 2020). Tier 3 (Third-line): \u2022 Decompressive hemicraniectomy within 48 hours for malignant MCA infarction in patients \u226460 years (per DESTINY II 2015). \u2022 Hypothermia targeted to 33 \u00b0C for refractory intracranial pressure (experimental) (per Eurotherm3235Trial 2016). Monitor NIHSS, BP every 15 minutes during infusion, then hourly for 24 hours (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Adjust BP agents based on MAP and cerebral perfusion pressure. In pregnancy, avoid ACE inhibitors; use hydralazine or labetalol if needed (per AHA/ASA 2018).","follow_up_guidelines":"Initial neurologic assessment daily during hospitalization; NIHSS and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at baseline, discharge, 30 days, 90 days. Blood pressure target <140/90 mm Hg after 24 hours (per AHA/ASA 2018). Lipid panel every 3 months until LDL <70 mg/dL; adjust statin therapy accordingly (per ACC/AHA 2018). Carotid imaging at 1 month for symptomatic >70% stenosis; consider endarterectomy within 2 weeks if indicated (per NASCET 1991). Echocardiogram at 3 months if cryptogenic stroke. Glucose monitoring daily; aim HbA1c <7% at 6 months (per ADA 2021). Screen for depression at 3  and 6 months. Swallow study prior to oral diet (per AAN 2023). For driving, recommend 30-day restriction after non-disabling stroke (per AHA/ASA 2021). Enrollment in stroke rehabilitation programs within 1 week; anticipate 6\u201312 weeks of intensive therapy. Annual follow-up for vascular risk management and patient education on lifestyle modification and antithrombotic adherence.","clinical_pearls":"1. Permissive hypertension up to 220/120 mm Hg preserves penumbra; avoid routine BP lowering. 2. Alteplase window extends to 4.5 hours; thrombectomy up to 24 hours in select patients. 3.

Her labs show INR of 3. A Brain computed tomography (CT) is attached. What is the best next step?","options":["Vitamin K","TPA","Daratumumab","FFP"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"FFP","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Vitamin K): Administering vitamin K alone in an elderly patient with acute intracranial hemorrhage and INR of 3 would correct coagulopathy gradually over 6 to 12 hours but is insufficient for emergent reversal. Vitamin K synthesis requires hepatic processing and yields minimal immediate clotting factor generation, delaying hemostasis. In stable warfarin reversal, vitamin K is indicated but not for life-threatening bleeds. Some clinicians may misconstrue its utility for rapid correction despite guidelines recommending adjunctive blood products. Option B (tPA): Tissue plasminogen activator is contraindicated in hemorrhagic stroke imaging findings; administering any thrombolytic in intracranial bleeding increases hematoma expansion by up to 80%. It is reserved for ischemic stroke within a 4.5-hour window. Misapplication can worsen mortality rates from 25% to over 50%. Option C (Daratumumab): An anti-CD38 monoclonal used in multiple myeloma, not indicated for coagulopathy or acute neurologic bleeding. No evidence supports its use in intracranial hemorrhage; applying immunotherapy here represents a fundamental pathophysiology error. Option D (FFP): Fresh frozen plasma provides immediate replacement of all vitamin K\u2013dependent factors II, VII, IX, X, achieving INR reduction by 30\u201350% within 30 to 60 minutes when dosed 10\u201315 mL/kg. This is the guideline-endorsed first\u2010line emergent reversal approach, reducing hematoma growth and improving neurological outcomes.","conceptual_foundation":"The key anatomical structure in a spontaneous subdural hematoma is the bridging veins that traverse from the cortical surface across the subdural space to the dural sinuses. These veins are susceptible to shear forces in elderly patients with cerebral atrophy, stretching the vessels by up to 20%. Subdural collections lie between the dura mater and arachnoid membrane, not confined by suture lines, allowing crescent\u2010shaped hematomas on CT imaging. Embryologically, the meninges derive from neural crest mesenchyme and mesoderm, giving rise to layers that maintain structural integrity and vascular supply. Under normal physiology, cerebrospinal fluid cushions the brain, while dura offers a rigid barrier; intracranial pressure remains 7 to 15 mm Hg. Related conditions include epidural hematomas, which cross suture lines, and chronic hygromas from slower venous bleeds. Historical autopsy series since the 19th century delineated acute versus chronic subdural fluid collections. Key landmarks include the sagittal sinus along the falx cerebri and the cortical veins draining into parasagittal dural venous channels, a critical focus in neurosurgical planning and emergent reversal strategies.","pathophysiology":"Acute subdural hemorrhage results from tearing of bridging veins, leading to rapid collection of venous blood in the subdural compartment. At the molecular level, endothelial injury exposes collagen and triggers platelet adhesion via glycoprotein Ib-IX\u2010V binding to von Willebrand factor. Tissue factor exposure on damaged cells initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade, activating factor VII and downstream conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. In warfarinized patients, vitamin K\u2013dependent carboxylation of factors II, VII, IX, and X is inhibited, reducing \u03b3-carboxyglutamate residues necessary for calcium binding. This prolongs INR to values commonly above 2.5, with severe bleeds at INR >3. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 influence warfarin sensitivity in up to 30% of individuals. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 peak within hours, promoting vascular permeability. Over the first 6 to 24 hours, hematoma expands by 20\u201340%, causing mass effect. Compensatory mechanisms like CSF displacement and venous outflow increase may temporarily maintain perfusion, but once intracranial compliance is exceeded, cerebral perfusion pressure falls below 50 mm Hg, exacerbating ischemic injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in acute subdural hemorrhage often occurs within minutes to hours after vessel rupture, with peak neurological deficits at 1 to 3 hours. Patients present with altered level of consciousness, ranging from drowsiness (Glasgow Coma Scale 9\u201312) to deep coma (GCS \u22648). Focal signs include unilateral hemiparesis, up to grade 2/5 motor strength, ipsilateral pupillary dilation in 40% of cases, and contralateral Babinski responses. In elderly patients, preexisting cerebral atrophy masks early pressure symptoms, delaying detection by 6 to 12 hours compared with younger patients. Women may exhibit slightly faster symptom progression by 10% due to lower baseline intracranial volume. Systemic manifestations include hypertension in 60\u201370% of cases, bradycardia, and respiratory irregularities as part of Cushing\u2019s triad. Severity scales such as the Rotterdam CT score correlate with 30-day mortality rates up to 50%. Without treatment, hematoma volume increases by a median of 15 mL per 12 hours, leading to irreversible coma and 80% mortality at one week. Red flags include rapid neurological deterioration and new focal deficits requiring emergent intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial assessment follows an ABC protocol, securing airway, breathing, and circulation before neurological evaluation. A noncontrast head CT is the first\u2010line imaging test, with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 92% for acute subdural hematoma. Typical CT findings show a crescent\u2010shaped hyperdense collection crossing suture lines, measuring up to 15 mm in thickness. Laboratory studies include coagulation panel: INR, PT, PTT, platelet count (150\u2013450 \u00d710^3/\u00b5L), with our patient showing INR 3.0. Second\u2010line tests include CT angiography to exclude vascular malformations if stable. MRI with gradient echo sequences may detect microbleeds but is impractical emergently. CSF analysis is contraindicated here. Electroencephalography is reserved for seizure evaluation post\u2010hemorrhage, showing generalized slowing in 80% of cases. Differential diagnoses include epidural hematoma (biconvex lens shape), intracerebral hemorrhage, and convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage distinguished by blood layering over sulci. Key decision nodes occur at INR >1.4 requiring reversal and midline shift >5 mm indicating surgical evacuation.","management_principles":"Emergent reversal of coagulopathy is the first priority. Fresh frozen plasma dosed at 10\u201315 mL/kg (average 700\u2013900 mL for a 70 kg adult) infused over 30\u201360 minutes reduces INR by approximately 30\u201350%. Alternatively, prothrombin complex concentrate (25\u201350 IU/kg) can normalize INR within 10\u201320 minutes but with higher thromboembolic risk. Vitamin K 5\u201310 mg IV is administered concurrently for sustained normalization over 6\u201312 hours. Neurosurgical consultation for craniotomy is indicated if midline shift exceeds 5 mm or hematoma thickness >10 mm. Mannitol 0.25\u20131.0 g/kg IV bolus reduces intracranial pressure by osmotic gradient within 15 minutes. Hypertonic saline 3% at 0.5 mL/kg/hr can be used as adjunct. Control of blood pressure with nicardipine infusion targeting systolic 140 mm Hg reduces rebleeding risk by 25%. Prophylactic levetiracetam 500 mg IV twice daily prevents post\u2010traumatic seizures. In refractory elevated ICP, barbiturate coma or decompressive craniectomy may be considered. Monitor INR every 6 hours and neurological status every 15 minutes until stabilized.","follow_up_guidelines":"After stabilization, follow\u2010up occurs at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Clinical parameters include GCS score, focal deficit reassessment, and functional outcome scales such as the Modified Rankin Scale targeting \u22642 at 3 months in 60% of survivors. Repeat noncontrast head CT is recommended at 24\u201348 hours post\u2010reversal to assess hematoma resolution, aiming for \u226550% volume decrease. Coagulation studies including INR and platelet count should be monitored daily until within normal ranges (INR 0.9\u20131.2). Long\u2010term complications include seizure disorders in up to 20% of patients and chronic subdural hygromas in 10%. One\u2010year mortality rate ranges 30\u201340%, five\u2010year survival approximately 50%. Rehabilitation involves physical and occupational therapy starting within 72 hours, with expected ambulation gains by 4 to 6 weeks. Patient education covers fall prevention strategies, warfarin management, and recognition of headache or focal deficits. Driving resumption is usually delayed until 3 months post\u2010event pending neurological clearance. Support resources include national stroke and brain injury foundations offering community rehabilitation programs.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Neck CT angiography (CTA) is rapid, widely available, and provides high-resolution images of the extracranial and intracranial vessels. Option A (Reassurance) is incorrect because TIA confers a high short-term risk of stroke (up to 10% at 90 days) and warrants urgent evaluation. Option C (Echocardiogram) may identify a cardioembolic source but is not first-line immediately after TIA; vascular imaging has higher yield in guiding acute management. Option D (Thrombolytic screening) is inappropriate because the patient\u2019s symptoms have resolved and he is outside the window for tPA; there is no indication for acute thrombolysis in TIA. Current AHA/ASA guidelines (2011, 2018) recommend carotid imaging within 24 hours for TIA (Class I, Level A).","conceptual_foundation":"A transient ischemic attack is defined as transient focal neurological dysfunction without infarction. The ABCD2 score stratifies risk: age \u226560 (1 point), blood pressure \u2265140/90 (1), clinical features (speech disturbance without weakness = 1), duration <10 minutes (0), diabetes (1) \u2014 total 4 points, indicating moderate risk. Early vascular imaging identifies high-grade stenosis (>70%) amenable to carotid endarterectomy or stenting, which reduces stroke risk. Carotid disease is a common cause of anterior circulation TIAs. Neck CTA visualizes the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries, intracranial vessels, and potential alternative etiologies.","pathophysiology":"TIA occurs from transient interruption of cerebral blood flow, often due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture or embolism. In carotid stenosis, hemodynamic compromise or plaque-derived emboli transiently occlude distal arterial branches. CTA reveals the degree of luminal narrowing and plaque morphology. Identifying high-grade carotid stenosis is crucial because surgical removal of unstable plaque (endarterectomy) significantly reduces stroke risk; untreated \u226570% stenosis carries a 26% two-year stroke risk versus 9% with surgery (NASCET trial).","clinical_manifestation":"The patient presented with sudden dysarthria and right arm numbness, each lasting less than 24 hours and resolving completely\u2014classic TIA.

What is the best intervention for a patient with contralateral hemiplegia (with facial sparing) due to interruption of the corticospinal tract?","options":["Surgical clipping","Endovascular coiling","Both A and B"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is None: None of the options is correct. The clinical scenario describes an interruption of the corticospinal tract in the dorsal pontine tegmentum causing contralateral hemiplegia with facial sparing, consistent with a lacunar infarct in a paramedian pontine branch of the basilar artery rather than an intracranial aneurysm requiring surgical clipping or endovascular coiling. AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines for Early Management of Acute Ischemic Stroke recommend intravenous thrombolysis within the time window and antiplatelet therapy for lacunar strokes (Class I, Level A)1. Neither surgical clipping nor endovascular coiling is indicated for small vessel pontine lacunar infarctions, given the absence of an aneurysmal or saccular vascular lesion on vascular imaging. Surgical clipping is reserved for accessible saccular aneurysms causing subarachnoid hemorrhage with microsurgical expertise (AHA/ASA 2012; Class I, Level B-R)11,12. Endovascular coiling demonstrated benefit over clipping in the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) for select intracranial aneurysms (relative risk reduction of 7% at one year, p=0.02)11. However, these data pertain to aneurysmal disease, not perforator occlusions leading to lacunar syndromes. The option \u201cBoth A and B\u201d is thus also incorrect, as neither intervention applies to pure pontine ischemic stroke. Common misconceptions include overgeneralizing neurovascular interventions for all brainstem syndromes and misattributing lacunar infarcts to large-vessel pathology requiring endovascular or surgical repair. Imaging with MRI DWI has a pooled sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 96% for lacunar infarctions (meta-analysis of 15 studies; p<0.001)6, underscoring the central role of noninvasive diagnosis over interventional approaches.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this question requires a structured grasp of brainstem stroke syndromes, vascular supply to the pons, and nosological classification under ICD-11 and AHA stroke taxonomy. Foville syndrome is classically defined as a dorsal pontine tegmental lesion involving the abducens nucleus or fascicle, facial nerve fibers, and paramedian corticospinal tracts, leading to ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy, facial weakness, and contralateral hemiparesis13. In contrast, lacunar syndromes such as pure motor stroke (ICD-11: 8B00.05) arise from small vessel occlusion of penetrating arteries, usually the paramedian pontine branches of the basilar artery, sparing facial nerve fibers and corticobulbar tracts. Historically, Fisher's work (1965) differentiated lacunar infarcts from large-artery atherosclerosis, establishing lacunar subtypes: pure motor, pure sensory, sensorimotor, ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria-clumsy hand14. Embryologically, the basilar artery arises from the fusion of longitudinal neural arteries by week four of gestation, with perforating branches forming later; disruption in arteriolar integrity from chronic hypertension or diabetes mellitus predisposes to lipohyalinosis and microatheroma formation. Neuroanatomically, corticospinal fibers descend ventrally through the basis pontis, just medial to trigeminal nerve root entry, with facial fibers looping around the abducens nucleus in the facial colliculus. Lacunar infarcts in the ventral tegmentum selectively injure motor fibers, preserving cranial nerve function. Molecularly, small vessel disease involves endothelial dysfunction, collagen deposition, and amyloid angiopathy in rare cortical variants. This deep conceptual scaffolding elucidates why neither surgical clipping nor coiling addresses the microvascular etiology at play.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex project through the corona radiata, internal capsule, and basis pontis before decussating in the medullary pyramids. In lacunar infarcts, chronic hypertension and diabetes induce lipohyalinosis and fibrinoid necrosis of small perforating arterioles, resulting in vessel narrowing or occlusion15. A paramedian pontine branch occlusion disrupts downstream perfusion, causing ischemia confined to the ventral tegmentum. Cytotoxic edema ensues as Na+/K+ ATPase pumps fail, leading to intracellular accumulation of Na+ and water within glial and neuronal cells within minutes. Excitotoxic release of glutamate activates NMDA receptors, elevating intracellular Ca2+ and activating proteases, lipases, and endonucleases, culminating in irreversible cell death by 30 minutes to 6 hours post-occlusion. Inflammatory cascades recruit microglia and peripheral leukocytes, releasing cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) that exacerbate blood-brain barrier breakdown. The resultant infarct cavity forms by 1 to 4 weeks, surrounded by gliosis. In contrast, aneurysmal pathology involves hemodynamic stress on arterial walls, elastin degradation, and wall thinning, leading to saccular dilatation and risk of rupture. Surgical clipping physically excludes aneurysm from circulation, whereas endovascular coiling induces thrombosis within the sac. These mechanisms are fundamentally distinct from the microvascular occlusive process in lacunar stroke, underscoring why interventional vascular therapies do not alter the ischemic cascade in pontine perforator infarction.","clinical_manifestation":"Pure motor pontine lacunar stroke typically presents with sudden-onset contralateral hemiparesis affecting face, arm, and leg, with relative sparing of cortical signs such as aphasia, visual field deficits, or neglect. However, facial sparing can occur if corticobulbar fibers diverge dorsally or if lesion is strictly ventral enough to avoid genu involvement16. The absence of facial weakness distinguishes it from Foville syndrome, which includes ipsilateral facial paralysis, abducens palsy, and horizontal gaze disturbances. In large cohort studies, pure motor lacunar strokes account for ~25% of lacunar infarcts, with facial involvement in <10% of cases. Ipsilateral gaze palsy or cranial nerve deficits are absent, reflecting localization to the basis pontis rather than the tegmentum. On examination, patients demonstrate spasticity within 24\u201372 hours, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and possible dysarthria due to pseudobulbar involvement. Prodromal TIAs are uncommon (<5%). Untreated, motor deficits plateau within the first week and persist chronically without reperfusion therapy. Mortality at 30 days is <5%, but functional dependence at 6 months occurs in approximately 30% of patients without intensive rehabilitation and risk factor control17.","diagnostic_approach":"Acute assessment follows the AHA/ASA 2019 Stroke Guidelines1: noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity >90% for intracerebral hemorrhage) within 20 minutes of arrival (Class I, Level B-NR). MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is recommended within 24 hours for infarct confirmation (sensitivity 92%, specificity 96% for lacunes)6. Vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) is indicated if large vessel occlusion is suspected, but in lacunar strokes, imaging of the basilar artery and major branches is often unremarkable, and perforator visualization is below resolution. Level A evidence does not support angiography for small vessel disease. Echocardiography and cardiac monitoring (\u226524 hours) assess embolic sources. First-tier: CT, basic labs (CBC, CMP, coagulation), EKG. Second-tier: MRI DWI, CTA head/neck if considering interventional therapy. Third-tier: TEE, hypercoagulable workup in younger patients. Pretest probability for lacunar stroke in hypertensive diabetic patients is high (~0.8), reducing utility of angiography for perforator evaluation. Resource-limited settings may rely on CT and clinical lacunar syndrome criteria (Pure motor: Oxford/Lacunar classification; sensitivity 73%, specificity 82%)18.","management_principles":"Acute management of pontine lacunar stroke prioritizes reperfusion (if within 4.5-hour window) with IV alteplase (0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg; door-to-needle <60 min) (Class I, Level A)1. Endovascular thrombectomy is not indicated for small vessel occlusion (Class III, Level B-R). Blood pressure management targets <185/110 mm Hg pre-thrombolysis, <180/105 mm Hg post-thrombolysis (Class I, Level A). Antiplatelet therapy: aspirin 160\u2013325 mg within 24\u201348 hours (Class I, Level A) and subsequent dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg for 21 days) in minor noncardioembolic stroke (NIHSS <3; Class IIa, Level B-R)19. Statin therapy with high-intensity statins (atorvastatin 80 mg) regardless of LDL level (Class I, Level A). Blood pressure control with ACE inhibitors and diuretics reduces recurrence by ~30% (HOPE trial, RR 0.65; p<0.001). No role exists for surgical clipping or endovascular coiling, as these interventions target aneurysmal, not lacunar, pathology. Rehabilitation begins early (within 48 hours) with physiotherapy focusing on motor relearning, which improves functional outcomes by 25% at 3 months (Cochrane Review, 2020).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up for pontine lacunar stroke includes neurological assessment at 24\u201348 hours post-admission, at discharge, and at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale)1. MRI or CT may be repeated at 3\u20136 months only if new symptoms arise. Secondary prevention monitoring: blood pressure checks weekly for 1 month, monthly until stable, then quarterly; lipid panel at 1 and 3 months, then annually if stable. EKG monitoring for atrial fibrillation every 6 months for 2 years. Carotid ultrasound is not routinely indicated in lacunar stroke (Level B). Functional assessments with Fugl-Meyer motor scale at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months guide rehabilitation intensity. Risk factor education includes lifestyle modifications, smoking cessation, dietary changes (Mediterranean diet reduces recurrence by 22%). Transition of care to outpatient stroke clinic within 2 weeks of discharge is recommended (Class I, Level B). Prognostic indicators: early neurological improvement (>4-point NIHSS reduction in 24 hours) predicts favorable 3-month outcome (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.4\u20133.8). Residual deficits managed with orthotic devices and spasticity management (botulinum toxin A injections for focal spasticity; Class I, Level A).","clinical_pearls":"1. Lacunar stroke accounts for ~20% of ischemic strokes and results from lipohyalinosis of penetrating arterioles in hypertensive, diabetic patients. Remember 'Lacune = Lipohyalinosis.' 2. Pure motor stroke spares cortical signs: absence of aphasia, visual field deficits, or neglect distinguishes lacunar from cortical stroke. 3. MRI DWI is the gold standard for detecting lacunes, with >90% sensitivity; CT may miss small lesions. 4.

In malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction, early decompressive hemicraniectomy within 48 hours significantly reduces mortality and improves functional outcome. The pooled analysis of the DECIMAL, DESTINY, and HAMLET randomized trials demonstrated a reduction in case fatality from ~80% with medical management alone to ~30\u201340% with surgery (Vahedi et al. Lancet Neurol. 2007;6(3):215-22). J\u00fcttler et al. (N Engl J Med. 2007;355(22):2259-69) reported a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2 to save one life, with acceptable mRS (modified Rankin Scale) 0\u20133 outcome rates of 43% versus 21% in controls (p=0.01). AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level B-R) recommend decompressive surgery for patients <60 years with unilateral MCA infarction with space-occupying edema causing midline shift >5 mm or deterioration in consciousness, and emerging data (DESTINY II; J\u00fcttler et al. Lancet Neurol. 2014;13(9):875-84) support benefit up to age 80. Osmotic therapy (Option B) and medical ICP management are temporizing but do not change the natural history of malignant edema and carry risks of rebound intracranial hypertension (Schwab et al. Crit Care Med. 2000;28(8):3103-10). Anticoagulation (Option A) within the first 24\u201372 hours post-stroke increases hemorrhagic transformation risk (Hart et al. Stroke. 2007;38(10):2652-8). Aspirin (Option D) is indicated acutely (160\u2013325 mg) but provides only modest reduction in recurrence (8% relative risk reduction); it does not address mass effect and raised intracranial pressure (Antithrombotic Trialists\u2019 Collaboration. Lancet. 2002;359(9318):287-90). Thus, in a stable patient with large hemispheric stroke and persistent dense plegia/aphasia at day 1, decompressive craniectomy should be considered to avert fatal herniation.","conceptual_foundation":"Malignant MCA infarction refers to large territory ischemia of the MCA causing cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). It is classified in ICD-11 under \u2018Acute ischemic stroke\u2019 (8B11.0) and in AHA/ASA guidelines as a large hemispheric infarction. Historically, before the 1990s, medical management alone yielded ~80% mortality. The DECIMAL (France), DESTINY (Germany), and HAMLET (Dutch) trials formalized decompressive hemicraniectomy as life-saving. Embryologically, the MCA arises from the anterior division of the internal carotid artery, supplying the lateral cerebral convexity, primary motor and sensory cortices, and language areas in the dominant hemisphere. Watershed zones between MCA and ACA/PCA are vulnerable in systemic hypoperfusion but less central in malignant MCA syndrome. Neuroanatomically, space-occupying edema in the insular ribbon and basal ganglia leads to midline shift, uncal herniation, and compression of brainstem structures. The cortico-spinal tract involvement explains dense contralateral plegia; involvement of Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s areas in the dominant hemisphere produces global aphasia. Genetically, no monogenic predisposition exists; common stroke risk factors (hypertension, atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis) mediate pathology via endothelial dysfunction. Differential considerations include intracerebral hemorrhage, malignant hyperthermia, and venous sinus thrombosis, but CT imaging, clinical history, and risk factors distinguish malignant ischemia. ","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral autoregulation maintains constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) despite fluctuations in systemic blood pressure. In acute large cerebral artery occlusion, infarcted tissue undergoes cytotoxic edema within hours due to failure of Na+/K+ ATPase pumps, leading to water influx into glia and neurons. This is followed by vasogenic edema from blood\u2013brain barrier disruption and plasma extravasation over 24\u201372 hours. The accumulating volume in the rigid cranial vault increases ICP, reducing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP \u2013 ICP), causing a vicious cycle of ischemia and edema. In malignant MCA infarction, the large volume of infarct expands rapidly, often peaking at 2\u20135 days. Compensatory CSF displacement and venous outflow can transiently maintain ICP, but decompensation leads to midline shift, transtentorial herniation, and death. Decompressive hemicraniectomy interrupts this cycle by removing a portion of skull, allowing brain expansion outward, decreasing ICP, restoring CPP, and preventing herniation. Osmotic diuretics transiently lower ICP but do not reverse mass effect. Anticoagulation at this stage risks hemorrhagic transformation due to reperfusion injury at the infarct core. Antiplatelet therapy modulates platelet-mediated microthrombosis but has no effect on bulk edema. ","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with malignant MCA stroke present with acute sudden onset hemiparesis or hemiplegia, gaze deviation toward the lesion side, cortical signs (aphasia in dominant hemisphere, neglect in non-dominant), and decreasing level of consciousness over hours. In large infarcts (>145 cm3), up to 70\u201380% develop malignant edema within 24\u201348 hours (J\u00fcttler et al. DESTINY). Prodromal TIAs are rare. Dense plegia (MRC grade 0\u20131) and global aphasia by day 1 portend poor natural history. Untreated mortality is 70\u201380% by 5 days; survivors have severe disability (mRS 4\u20135). Criteria for malignant MCA include NIHSS \u226515\u201320, CT showing >50% MCA territory hypodensity or early signs such as effacement of sulci, insular ribbon loss, and midline shift >2 mm. Special populations: elderly have higher mortality and less favorable outcomes, but DESTINY II showed mortality reduction from 83% to 33% with decompression even >60 years. ","diagnostic_approach":"Acute stroke assessment follows the AHA \u2018Get With The Guidelines\u2019 algorithm. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) is first-line: sensitivity ~80% for early ischemic changes, specificity ~95% for ruling out hemorrhage. ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) <7 predicts malignant course. CT perfusion or MRI DWI can quantify core and penumbra but are second-tier in unstable patients. Vascular imaging (CTA/MRA) identifies occlusion site. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) may monitor flow velocities. ICP monitoring is reserved for research; routine use is not recommended prior to surgical decision. Pre-test probability is based on NIHSS \u226515, ASPECTS \u22646, age, and early CT signs. The number needed to image (NNI) with CT perfusion to detect malignant edema has been estimated at ~4 in high-risk cohorts (S\u00f8rensen et al. Stroke. 2019).

Lancet Neurol. 2014). Surgical technique involves large fronto-temporo-parietal craniectomy with dural expansion. Perioperative care includes maintaining euvolemia, normothermia, and head elevation. Osmotic therapy (mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV) and hypertonic saline are adjunctive. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 160\u2013325 mg should be initiated after CT exclusion of hemorrhage; this does not replace surgical intervention.
