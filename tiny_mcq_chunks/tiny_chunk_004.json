In syringomyelia the central canal expands to form a syrinx that impinges on the lateral horn of the spinal cord, disrupting sympathetic preganglionic fibers and causing ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome. Fourth cranial nerve palsy is unrelated to spinal cord pathology.","conceptual_foundation":"Syringomyelia is characterized by a fluid-filled cavity within the central spinal cord. As it enlarges, it first affects crossing spinothalamic fibers, producing a bilateral 'cape-like' loss of pain and temperature. Further expansion involves the lateral horn (preganglionic sympathetic neurons) and ventral horn (lower motor neurons) at the affected levels.","pathophysiology":"The syrinx fluid exerts chronic pressure on adjacent grey matter. Compression of the intermediolateral cell column at T1\u2013T2 interrupts sympathetic outflow to the eye and face, causing miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis. Ventral horn involvement leads to segmental weakness and atrophy of upper limb muscles.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with pain and temperature loss over shoulders and arms in a shawl distribution. Ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and facial anhidrosis denote Horner\u2019s syndrome. With ventral horn compression, flaccid weakness and muscle wasting appear in the hands and forearms.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI of the cervical and upper thoracic spine demonstrates an intramedullary syrinx. Typical findings include a fluid-filled cavity extending multiple segments without contrast enhancement. CT myelography is an alternative when MRI is contraindicated.","management_principles":"Definitive treatment involves surgical decompression, often with posterior fossa decompression if Chiari I malformation coexists. Direct drainage via syringoperitoneal shunt can be considered in refractory cases. Conservative management includes analgesia, physical therapy, and close observation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI at three to six months assesses reduction in syrinx size. Neurological examinations every three to six months monitor symptom progression or recurrence. Long-term monitoring addresses potential shunt complications and spinal stability.","clinical_pearls":"1 Syringomyelia produces a 'cape-like' analgesia for pain and temperature. 2 Ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome arises from lateral horn sympathetic disruption. 3 Commonly associated with Chiari I malformation. 4 MRI is the diagnostic study of choice. 5 Surgical decompression often halts progression.","references":"1 Heiss JD et al.

What type of lesion is indicated?","options":["Postganglionic","Preganglionic","Intermediolateral"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Postganglionic","subspecialty":"Neuroanatomy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: postganglionic. Ipsilateral tongue deviation indicates a hypoglossal (XII) nerve lesion. Ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome signals interruption of the oculosympathetic pathway distal to the superior cervical ganglion\u2014i.e., postganglionic fibers traveling along the internal carotid artery. Together this localizes to a lesion at the skull base or carotid sheath affecting both structures. Option B (preganglionic) involves fibers proximal to the ganglion\u2014would not affect those hitchhiking on the carotid artery. Option C (intermediolateral) refers to spinal cord sympathetic neurons\u2014would not produce Horner\u2019s limited to one side of the face.","conceptual_foundation":"The oculosympathetic pathway spans three neurons: first-order central in the hypothalamus, second-order preganglionic between T1\u2013T3 to the superior cervical ganglion, and third-order postganglionic along the carotid plexus. Hypoglossal nucleus lies in the dorsal medulla; the nerve exits via the hypoglossal canal. A lesion at the carotid sheath injures both the third-order sympathetic fibers and CN XII after skull base exit.","pathophysiology":"Postganglionic (third-order) Horner\u2019s arises when sympathetic fibers that have synapsed in the superior cervical ganglion are disrupted. Loss of norepinephrine release leads to miosis, mild ptosis (due to Mueller\u2019s muscle), and facial anhidrosis. Simultaneous damage to CN XII impairs intrinsic tongue muscle function, causing deviation toward the side of lesion on protrusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Postganglionic Horner\u2019s presents with ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis of the ipsilateral forehead. Cocaine test shows lack of dilation; apraclonidine reverses anisocoria. Hypoglossal nerve palsy causes ipsilateral atrophy of the tongue with fasciculations and deviation to the weak side. Combined presentation is seen in syndromes like the carotid artery dissection or skull base tumors.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial clinical diagnosis via pharmacologic eye testing: cocaine or apraclonidine. Localization by hydroxyamphetamine distinguishes pre- vs. postganglionic. Imaging with MRI/MRA of neck and skull base to identify lesions along the carotid sheath or jugular foramen. CT angiography helps detect dissections or mass lesions.","management_principles":"Treatment targets underlying cause. For carotid dissection, antithrombotic therapy is indicated. For tumors, surgical resection or radiotherapy. Symptomatic relief of ptosis can include eyelid crutches. Anhidrosis management is supportive.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurological deficits and lesion progression with serial imaging every 3\u20136 months. Reassess pharmacologic tests if new signs develop. Coordinate with ENT or neurosurgery for lesion-specific follow-up.","clinical_pearls":"1. Co-occurrence of CN XII palsy and Horner\u2019s localizes to lateral skull base. 2. Third-order sympathetic fibers travel on ICA\u2014injury here is postganglionic. 3. Apraclonidine testing is a practical clinic tool: reversal of ptosis in Horner\u2019s. 4. Tongue deviation is toward the side of lesion in hypoglossal palsy. 5.

In the visual pathway, after the optic tract fibers leave the optic chiasm, they synapse in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus before relaying via the optic radiations to the primary visual cortex. Option B, Medial geniculate body, is part of the auditory pathway and is not involved in vision.","conceptual_foundation":"The visual pathway consists of the retina \u2192 optic nerve \u2192 optic chiasm \u2192 optic tract \u2192 LGN \u2192 Meyer's loop and dorsal optic radiations \u2192 primary visual cortex (V1) in the occipital lobe. The LGN is part of the dorsal thalamic nuclei, organized into layers processing parvocellular and magnocellular input.","pathophysiology":"Lesions in the LGN interrupt the final thalamic relay of visual information, producing contralateral homonymous hemianopia with possible macular sparing depending on cortical contributions. The MGB lesion would affect audition with no visual signs.","clinical_manifestation":"LGN lesions cause homonymous hemianopia, often congruous, with preserved pupillary light reflexes due to midbrain pathways bypassing the LGN. Visual field testing localizes the lesion to the thalamus.","diagnostic_approach":"Visual field perimetry documents the defect. MRI with high-resolution sequences can identify LGN infarcts or lesions. Functional MRI can map LGN activation.","management_principles":"Management depends on etiology: ischemic stroke protocol for LGN infarct, tumor resection for metastasis, immunotherapy for demyelination. Rehabilitation with visual field training can improve compensatory saccades.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial visual field testing every 3\u20136 months for stable lesions. MRI surveillance per underlying pathology guidelines (e.g., stroke, tumor). Referral to vision rehabilitation services.","clinical_pearls":"1. LGN is the thalamic relay for vision; MGB is for hearing. 2. Lesions here cause contralateral homonymous hemianopia with sparing of pupillary reflex. 3. MRI is the imaging modality of choice. 4. Visual field testing is key to localization. 5. Rehabilitation improves daily functioning despite permanent field loss.","references":"1. Nieuwenhuys R, Voogd J, van Huijzen C.
