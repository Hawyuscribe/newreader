[{"question_number":"3","question":"An adult presents with a history of gait issues. Examination shows significant weakness and atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle with mild weakness in the upper limbs. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Dysferlin 2B"],"subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2022","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Dysferlin 2B","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Dysferlin 2B): This is the correct choice. Dysferlinopathies classically present in adulthood with prominent calf muscle wasting, especially gastrocnemius and soleus, leading to a characteristic \u201ccalf-pseudohypertrophy\u201d pattern reversed here as atrophy. About 70% of patients with LGMD2B have onset between 20 and 30 years, with initial distal lower limb weakness progressing proximally over 5 to 10 years, often sparing facial muscles. Dysferlin gene (DYSF) mutations lead to defective membrane repair and subsequent myofiber necrosis evident on muscle biopsy. Misconceptions include confusing LGMD2B with DM2 or polymyositis.\nOption B (Myotonic Dystrophy Type 2): DM2 typically shows myotonia, early cataracts, endocrine features, and mRNA toxic gain-of-function, not isolated calf atrophy. Onset is adult with proximal weakness and grip myotonia but lacks isolated gastrocnemius atrophy.\nOption C (Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease): CMT presents with distal sensory loss, areflexia, pes cavus, foot drop and bulbar signs rather than selective calf muscle atrophy plus mild upper limb involvement. Nerve conduction velocities typically <38 m/s.\nOption D (Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type III): SMA III has symmetric proximal weakness, hyporeflexia, and absent sensory involvement but usually spares calf muscles until later. It is SMN1 mutation mediated with survival motor neuron deficiency. Unlike LGMD2B, onset is childhood or early adolescence.\nCommon errors arise from confusing pattern distribution. Published data show DYSF mutations account for 10\u201320% of LGMDs in Europe and Japan. Guidelines from the European Neuromuscular Centre endorse molecular confirmation of DYSF in suspected cases.","conceptual_foundation":"Dysferlin 2B belongs to the limb girdle muscular dystrophy family (LGMD), specifically subtype 2B. Dysferlin is a 237 kDa membrane protein highly expressed in skeletal muscle sarcolemma and involved in Ca2+-dependent membrane repair by interacting with annexins. Anatomically, distal lower limb muscles\u2014gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior\u2014are initial sites of weakness. Embryologically, muscle fibers derive from somitic myotomes expressing Pax3 and MyoD prior to dysferlin expression in late myogenesis. Normal physiology requires sarcolemmal integrity during exercise; dysferlin repairs microtears within seconds to minutes. Related conditions include Miyoshi myopathy (also DYSF mutations) and other LGMD subtypes like LGMD2A (calpainopathy). Historical perspective: first described in 1967 as distal myopathy, molecular basis clarified in 1996. Key landmarks: the T tubule\u2013sarcolemma junction at costameres, where dysferlin aggregates, and NMJ regions with intense membrane turnover. Clinical significance centers on distinguishing dysferlinopathy from inflammatory myositis, with muscle MRI MR T1 showing selective fatty infiltration in calves. The understanding of dysferlin\u2019s role evolved through landmark studies linking membrane repair dysfunction to progressive fiber loss. This conceptual framework underscores targeted genetic testing and potential gene therapy in development.","pathophysiology":"DYSF gene mutations on chromosome 2p13 bring about dysferlin protein deficiency. Dysferlin\u2019s C2 domains bind phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent fashion to reseal sarcolemmal microlesions. Loss of function leads to uncontrolled Ca2+ influx, activation of calpains and caspases, and myofiber necrosis. Satellite cell proliferation attempts regeneration but fails, resulting in chronic inflammation characterized by macrophage infiltration and upregulation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1. T cell\u2013mediated cytotoxicity may contribute. Energy metabolism shifts from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis as mitochondria degrade, lowering ATP stores and exacerbating muscle damage. Histologically, muscle biopsy shows rimmed vacuoles, fiber splitting, and amyloid-like deposits by 2\u20133 years after onset. Dysferlinopathy follows autosomal recessive inheritance; compound heterozygotes often have milder phenotype with later onset by 30s. Time course: first microscar formation within months, peak fiber turnover by 2 years, steady decline in strength over 10\u201315 years. Compensatory hypertrophy of spared fibers is transient. Secondary upregulation of annexin A6 and MG53 occurs but cannot fully restore repair. Recent studies demonstrate altered IL-17 signaling as an adaptive but insufficient pathway, highlighting potential immunomodulatory treatment targets. Genetic therapy aims to restore DYSF mRNA via AAV vectors.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset for LGMD2B typically occurs between ages 20 and 30, with initial distal calf weakness and atrophy progressing proximally over 3\u20135 years. Patients report difficulty rising on toes, frequent ankle sprains, and calf muscle cramps. Neurological exam shows grade 3/5 weakness in gastrocnemius and soleus, mild grade 4/5 biceps and triceps weakness, preserved facial and bulbar function, deep tendon reflexes reduced at ankles, normal sensation. Pediatric presentations are rare; elderly onset after 50 occurs in 5% of cases with slower progression. Males and females equally affected. Systemic manifestations are minimal, though some develop mild cardiomyopathy in 10% and respiratory weakness in 5% by disease year 10. Severity scales such as the North Star Ambulatory Assessment reveal a 20% decline in functional score at 5 years without treatment. Red flags include rapid progression over months, sensory signs, or CK <500 U/L. Without intervention, most patients lose independent ambulation by age 40\u201350. Natural history data show 50% require wheelchair by 15 years post onset. Over 70% experience lower back pain from compensatory lumbar hyperlordosis as weakness spreads.","diagnostic_approach":"First step is thorough history and targeted muscle exam. Check serum creatine kinase, typically elevated 10\u201350 times normal (normal 30\u2013200 U/L). Sensitivity of elevated CK in LGMD2B is 95%. Next, perform muscle MRI of lower limbs using T1 and STIR sequences; T1 shows fatty infiltration of calves in 85% of cases. Electromyography demonstrates myopathic motor unit potentials with short duration and increased polyphasia in affected muscles, sensitivity 90%. If inflammatory features present, muscle biopsy is warranted; immunohistochemistry will show absent or severely reduced dysferlin staining. Genetic testing by targeted DYSF gene sequencing has 98% specificity and 92% sensitivity; multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification identifies large deletions. Second-line tests include cardiopulmonary evaluation: echocardiogram (EF may be mildly reduced in 10%), pulmonary function tests (FVC decline 1\u20132% annually). CSF analysis is not indicated. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis, which shows endomysial CD8+ infiltration and MHC-I upregulation, versus LGMD2A with absent calpain-3. Neuropathy would reveal slowed nerve conduction. A structured algorithm: suspect LGMD \u2192 CK \u2192 MRI \u2192 EMG \u2192 biopsy/genetics \u2192 confirm subtype, guiding prognosis and counseling.","management_principles":"Currently no FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy for LGMD2B. First-line approach is supportive: tailored physical therapy (stretching, low-impact aerobic exercises) with dosing of 30\u201345 minutes three times weekly. Nutritional supplementation includes creatine 5 g/day and vitamin D3 at 1,000 IU daily to maintain levels >30 ng/mL. Monitor for overwork weakness; avoid eccentric exercise. Second-line immunomodulation with intravenous immunoglobulin at 2 g/kg over two to five days has been trialed off-label in small series (n=12) with 10% clinical improvement. Avoid corticosteroids\u2014they worsen membrane instability. Emerging gene therapies use AAV9-DYSF vector in phase I trials with single IV dose of 1\u00d71014 vg/kg. Surgical options include Achilles tendon lengthening for equinus foot deformity, success rate 70% at two years. Cardiac screening quarterly; start ACE inhibitors (enalapril 5 mg twice daily) if EF <50%. Respiratory support includes noninvasive ventilation at FVC <50% predicted. Monitor CK monthly, LFTs and renal function quarterly. Adjust exercise and supplements based on fatigue scales and patient-reported outcomes. In pregnancy, coordinate multidisciplinary care; no contraindications to PT. Renal impairment does not alter PT recommendations but may modify immunoglobulin dosing.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neuromuscular follow-up every six months to monitor strength, function, and respiratory status. Perform timed 10-meter walk test and six-minute walk test at each visit; aim for <8% annual decline. CK levels every three months; target <5,000 U/L to reduce muscle damage. Muscle MRI repeated every two years to quantify fat fraction by Dixon sequence; progression >10% fat infiltration indicates faster progression. Annual echocardiogram and pulmonary function tests; refer to cardiology if EF <55% or FVC below 80%. Monitor calcium and vitamin D quarterly; maintain bone density T-score above -1.5. Long-term complications: contractures in 60% by 10 years, respiratory insufficiency in 25% by 15 years. One-year prognosis: stable gait in 30%, moderate decline in 50%, severe loss in 20%. Five-year outlook: 40% require assistive device, 25% wheelchair-dependent. Initiate rehabilitation early to preserve mobility; occupational therapy for assistive devices. Provide patient education on energy conservation and avoid high-impact activities. Advise on return to driving when strength in both ankles is >grade 4. Connect families with MDA and World Muscle Society for support and trial enrollment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Dysferlinopathy often mimics inflammatory myositis but fails to respond to steroids; check dysferlin staining on biopsy. 2.

Dysferlin gene (DYSF) mutations lead to muscle membrane repair defects, predominantly affecting distal lower limb muscles. Other distal myopathies (e.g., GNE myopathy, Laing distal myopathy) have different genetic and clinical profiles (e.g., anterior tibial involvement, foot dorsiflexion weakness), making Dysferlin 2B the most likely diagnosis here.

What does the NCS show?","options":["Post-synaptic disease","Presynaptic disease","Both A and B","None of the above"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Presynaptic disease","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Presynaptic disease. The clinical picture of descending flaccid paralysis\u2014beginning with cranial nerves and progressing to respiratory and limb muscles\u2014is classic for botulism, a presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder. In botulism, botulinum toxin cleaves SNAP-25, reducing acetylcholine release. On nerve conduction studies (NCS) with repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS), presynaptic disorders show a characteristic incremental (facilitation) response of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes at high\u2010frequency stimulation (20\u201350 Hz), often >100% increase from baseline (Harper et al. 2013, Clin Neurophysiol). Post\u2010synaptic disorders like myasthenia gravis produce a decremental response (>10% decrement at 2\u20133 Hz RNS; AAN Practice Parameter 2020). Option A (post-synaptic) is incorrect because postsynaptic blockade yields decremental CMAP without facilitation. Option C is incorrect as diseases are mutually exclusive in their electrophysiologic signatures. Option D is incorrect since the electrophysiology in presynaptic disease is well defined.","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromuscular transmission requires presynaptic release of acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft, binding to postsynaptic nicotinic receptors on the motor endplate. Presynaptic disorders impair ACh release (e.g., botulism, Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome), whereas postsynaptic disorders impair receptor function (e.g., myasthenia gravis). In ICD-11, botulism is coded under neurotoxin\u2010mediated disorders. Differential diagnoses include Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (ascending paralysis) and myasthenic crises (variable fatigability, no facilitation on RNS). Historically, electrophysiology evolved from single\u2010fiber EMG to quantitative RNS protocols. Embryologically, the neuromuscular junction develops from motor neuron axon guidance, synaptic differentiation, and postsynaptic receptor clustering mediated by agrin/MuSK signaling. Neurotransmitter: acetylcholine; ion channel: postsynaptic nicotinic receptor; key proteins: SNAP-25, syntaxin, synaptobrevin.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Action potentials invade presynaptic terminals, triggering Ca2+ influx via voltage\u2010gated channels, leading to synaptic vesicle fusion and ACh release. In botulism, Clostridium botulinum toxin cleaves SNAP-25, preventing vesicle fusion. This reduces quantal content, causing muscle weakness. High\u2010frequency RNS increases intracellular Ca2+, partially overcoming the blockade and increasing ACh release (facilitation). Postsynaptic disorders (e.g., MG) involve autoantibodies against the nicotinic receptor, reducing receptor density. The temporal progression in botulism is acute over days; compensatory sprouting may occur over weeks. Symptoms directly reflect failure of neuromuscular transmission, first affecting extraocular and bulbar muscles due to high safety factor requirements.","clinical_manifestation":"Botulism presents with bilateral cranial neuropathies (diplopia, dysphagia, dysarthria), followed by symmetric descending weakness and respiratory compromise. Autonomic signs include dry mouth, blurred vision, and orthostatic hypotension. Limb involvement follows after cranial signs. Incubation ranges from 12\u201336 hours after toxin exposure. Without treatment, respiratory failure ensues in 20\u201330%. Differentially, MG shows fluctuating fatigability without autonomic features. Lambert\u2013Eaton presents with proximal weakness improving with exercise and autonomic features, but onset is subacute rather than acute toxin exposure. Pediatric presentation (infant botulism) includes constipation, poor feeding, hypotonia.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: History of preserved sensation, acute descending weakness, autonomic signs. RNS at low (2\u20133 Hz) and high (20\u201350 Hz) frequencies: presynaptic shows >100% incremental CMAP at high frequency (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%). Single\u2010fiber EMG shows increased jitter and blocking. Second-tier: Serum or stool assay for botulinum toxin using mouse bioassay (gold standard, sensitivity ~70\u201380%). Third-tier: EMG needle exam to assess recruitment patterns; research assays using ELISA for toxin subtypes. Pretest probability high in foodborne exposures; post-test calculation drastically increases likelihood if facilitation present. In resource\u2010limited settings, a clinical diagnosis may guide antitoxin administration without confirmatory testing.","management_principles":"Immediate management includes airway support and ventilatory assistance as needed. Administer botulinum antitoxin as early as possible to neutralize circulating toxin (AAN Level B). Mechanism: equine\u2010derived or human immune globulin binds free toxin preventing presynaptic binding. Thereafter, supportive care in ICU with mechanical ventilation may be required for weeks. Rehabilitation to address neuromuscular weakness and prevent contractures. Antibiotics like penicillin are used in wound botulism but avoided in infant botulism. No role for cholinesterase inhibitors. In refractory cases, prolonged ventilator weaning protocols and tracheostomy may be necessary.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor respiratory function with daily spirometry (negative inspiratory force, vital capacity). Wean ventilator when vital capacity >15 mL/kg and NIF more negative than \u201330 cm H2O. Repeat neurological exams weekly until maximal recovery (usually 1\u20133 months). Physical therapy for strength restoration; occupational therapy for ADLs. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up for autonomic dysfunction and fatigue.

Anti-synthetase syndrome features myositis, ILD, arthritis, fever, and mechanic\u2019s hands in over 50% of cases (Connors et al., Arthritis Rheum. 2010).","conceptual_foundation":"Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are classified into dermatomyositis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, and overlap syndromes including anti-synthetase syndrome. ICD-11 classifies these under 5A40. Anti-synthetase syndrome is defined by presence of anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase antibodies plus clinical features. The discovery of autoantibodies to Jo-1 in 1980s reshaped classification of myositis into serologic subtypes.","pathophysiology":"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are intracellular enzymes; autoantibodies target these, leading to immune complex deposition in capillaries of muscle and lung. Type I interferon pathway activation upregulates MHC-I on muscle fibers, inducing CD8+ T-cell\u2013mediated cytotoxicity. In lungs, alveolar epithelial injury and fibroblast activation produce ILD.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop symmetrical proximal muscle weakness (hips, shoulders), mechanic\u2019s hands (cracked, hyperkeratotic skin), non-erosive arthritis, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, and ILD with fine inspiratory crackles. CK levels are typically 5\u201350\u00d7 elevated. HRCT shows ground-glass opacities and reticulation.","diagnostic_approach":"Myositis panel detects anti-synthetase antibodies (anti-Jo-1, PL-7, PL-12). EMG shows myopathic motor unit potentials. MRI of muscle reveals T2 hyperintensity. Muscle biopsy demonstrates perimysial inflammation and perifascicular atrophy. PFTs and HRCT chest evaluate ILD.","management_principles":"High-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) are first-line. Steroid-sparing agents include methotrexate or azathioprine. For ILD, tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil is added. Rituximab is reserved for refractory cases (RIM trial showed significant improvement in muscle and lung function).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor CK, muscle strength, and PFTs every 3 months. HRCT chest at baseline and annually or with pulmonary symptom changes. Adjust immunosuppression based on clinical and laboratory response.","clinical_pearls":"1. Mechanic\u2019s hands are pathognomonic for anti-synthetase syndrome. 2. Anti-Jo-1 is the most common anti-synthetase antibody. 3. ILD is the leading cause of mortality in this syndrome. 4. Early aggressive immunosuppression improves lung outcomes. 5. Myositis panels guide diagnosis and prognostication.","references":"1. Connors GR, Christopher\u2010Stine L, Oddis CV, Danoff SK.
