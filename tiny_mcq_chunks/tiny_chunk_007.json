The correct enzyme deficiency is alpha-galactosidase A. Therefore none of the provided options is correct. In Fabry disease, mutations in the GLA gene on Xq22 result in deficient alpha-galactosidase A activity, leading to progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in lysosomes.","conceptual_foundation":"Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder (ICD-11 5B61) caused by deficient alpha-galactosidase A. It belongs to the family of sphingolipidoses and is differentiated from Gaucher (beta-glucocerebrosidase deficiency) and Tay-Sachs (hexosaminidase A deficiency). First described by Johannes Fabry in 1898 and William Anderson in 1899, the molecular genetic basis was elucidated in the 1980s, leading to enzyme replacement therapy development.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, alpha-galactosidase A hydrolyzes terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties from glycolipids such as globotriaosylceramide. Enzyme deficiency leads to lysosomal accumulation of these glycosphingolipids in vascular endothelium, renal podocytes, cardiomyocytes, and dorsal root ganglia. Accumulation triggers inflammatory cascades, oxidative stress, and progressive vascular dysfunction, resulting in angiokeratomas, corneal opacities, neuropathic pain, renal failure, and cardiomyopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic Fabry disease presents in childhood/adolescence with acroparesthesias, angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, and corneal verticillata. Progressive renal involvement leads to proteinuria and end-stage renal disease by the fourth decade. Cardiac manifestations include left ventricular hypertrophy and arrhythmias. Life expectancy is reduced by ~15\u201320 years in males. Heterozygous females exhibit variable penetrance due to lyonization.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is made by measuring alpha-galactosidase A activity in leukocytes or plasma (low in affected males; may be normal in females), followed by GLA gene sequencing. Lyso-GL-3 levels correlate with disease burden. Early diagnosis enables prompt initiation of enzyme replacement or chaperone therapy.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is intravenous recombinant alpha-galactosidase A (agalsidase beta 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks) to reduce substrate accumulation and slow organ damage (AHA 2018 consensus). Oral chaperone migalastat is indicated for amenable mutations. Adjunctive management includes ACE inhibitors for proteinuria, pain control for neuropathy, and heart failure therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical status every 6\u201312 months, including renal function (eGFR, proteinuria), cardiac imaging (echocardiogram annual), and plasma lyso-GL-3 levels. Surveillance for cerebrovascular events with periodic brain MRI. Adjust therapy based on clinical progression and antibody development to ERT.","clinical_pearls":"1. Fabry disease is X-linked; females can be symptomatic. 2. Angiokeratomas in a bathing-trunk distribution are pathognomonic. 3. Corneal verticillata may be seen on slit lamp exam without visual impairment. 4. Early ERT improves renal and cardiac outcomes. 5. Acroparesthesia often responds to anticonvulsants or SNRIs.","references":"1. Germain DP. Fabry disease. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2010;5:30. doi:10.1186/1750-1172-5-30\n2. Ortiz A et al.
