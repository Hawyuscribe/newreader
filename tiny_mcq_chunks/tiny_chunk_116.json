[{"question_number":"4","question":"Which of the following statements is correct regarding anti thrombotic mechanism of actions in vascular neurology?","options":["Apixaban, Edoxaban and Ruvaroxaban are direct thrombin inhibitor.","Ticagrelol is reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist.","Aspirin works on arachidonic acid substrate.","Clopidegrol is irreversible factors 3,7,10 inhibitors."],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Ticagrelol is reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist.","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Ticagrelor is a reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist. Ticagrelor binds non-competitively to the platelet P2Y12 ADP receptor and dissociates within hours, providing reversible inhibition (PLATO trial: 16% relative risk reduction vs clopidogrel, HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77\u20130.92; NEJM 2009). \n\nOption A is incorrect: Apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are direct factor Xa inhibitors, not direct thrombin inhibitors. Option C is misleading: Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), preventing thromboxane A2 synthesis, not acting directly on arachidonic acid substrate. Option D is false: Clopidogrel irreversibly inhibits P2Y12 receptors, not factors III, VII, X.","conceptual_foundation":"Antithrombotic agents are divided into antiplatelets and anticoagulants. Antiplatelets (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) interfere with platelet activation/aggregation. Anticoagulants (heparins, direct oral anticoagulants, warfarin) target the coagulation cascade. Major stroke guidelines (AHA/ASA 2019) classify these agents by mechanism, indication, and bleeding risk.","pathophysiology":"Platelet activation via ADP binding to P2Y12 receptor amplifies aggregation through GPIIb/IIIa activation. Ticagrelor inhibits this cascade reversibly. Factor Xa inhibitors directly bind the active site of Xa, preventing prothrombin conversion. Direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) bind thrombin\u2019s active site. Aspirin\u2019s acetylation of serine 530 on COX-1 irreversibly blocks conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2.","clinical_manifestation":"In vascular neurology, antithrombotics reduce risk of recurrent ischemic stroke and cardiovascular events. Aspirin lowers recurrent stroke risk by ~22%. Ticagrelor is approved for acute coronary syndrome and under study for stroke prevention in high-risk TIA/stroke (SOCRATES trial). Xa inhibitors reduce stroke risk in atrial fibrillation by ~65% relative to placebo.","diagnostic_approach":"Before initiating antithrombotics, assess bleeding risk (HAS-BLED, CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc). Platelet function testing (VerifyNow P2Y12 assay) can assess P2Y12 inhibition for clopidogrel but is not routinely recommended. Renal function guides dosing of DOACs.","management_principles":"Aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily is first-line for noncardioembolic stroke (Class I, Level A). For high-risk TIA/minor stroke, dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel) for 21 days reduces recurrence (CHANCE trial). In AF-related stroke, DOACs are preferred over warfarin except in mechanical valve patients. Ticagrelor is not first-line for stroke prevention but may be considered in select high-risk cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for bleeding, adherence, and efficacy. Reassess risk scores every 6\u201312 months. In DOAC-treated patients, check renal function annually. No routine platelet function testing is recommended outside research.","clinical_pearls":"1. DOACs differ: dabigatran = direct thrombin inhibitor; apixaban/edoxaban/rivaroxaban = factor Xa inhibitors. 2. Ticagrelor is reversible, clopidogrel irreversible. 3. Aspirin\u2019s effect lasts platelet lifespan (~7 days). 4. Dual antiplatelet therapy limited to 21 days post-TIA/minor stroke. 5. Monitor renal function for DOAC dosing.","references":"[1] Connolly SJ et al. PLATO trial: Ticagrelor vs clopidogrel. N Engl J Med. 2009;361(11):1045\u201357. DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa0904327.

It is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with very high affinity, reversing its anticoagulant effect within minutes. The RE-VERSE AD trial (N Engl J Med 2015) showed normalization of coagulation parameters in 88% of patients within 4 hrs and cessation of bleeding in 93%.\n\nOption A (PCC) has limited efficacy for dabigatran reversal; Factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity (FEIBA) may help but lacks specific approval. Option C (Vitamin K) is ineffective against direct thrombin inhibitors. Option D (FFP) does not reverse dabigatran because it does not replace inhibited enzyme and carries volume/alloimmunization risks.","conceptual_foundation":"In hemorrhagic complications on anticoagulation, specific reversal agents reduce mortality and hematoma expansion. Direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran) have targeted antidotes (idarucizumab). Factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban) use andexanet alfa. Warfarin is reversed with vitamin K and PCC. Guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018) recommend idarucizumab for dabigatran\u2010related life-threatening bleeding.","pathophysiology":"Dabigatran directly inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin, preventing fibrin formation. In ICH, ongoing dabigatran activity exacerbates bleeding. Idarucizumab neutralizes dabigatran by forming a complex with higher affinity than thrombin, rapidly restoring thrombin activity and enabling clot stabilization.","clinical_manifestation":"Post\u2010endovascular thrombectomy hemorrhage typically presents with neurological decline and CT evidence of hyperdense hematoma at infarct site within 24 hrs. Symptoms include worsening hemiparesis, altered consciousness, and increased intracranial pressure. Rapid reversal of anticoagulation is crucial to limit hematoma expansion and secondary brain injury.","diagnostic_approach":"Assess anticoagulant level via thrombin time or diluted thrombin time (sensitive to dabigatran). If elevated and life\u2010threatening bleed, administer antidote. Brain CT confirms hemorrhage volume and guides neurosurgical decision making. Coagulation lab turnaround should be <30 minutes in stroke centers.","management_principles":"Idarucizumab 5 g IV (two 2.5 g boluses) is recommended immediately upon confirmation of dabigatran\u2010related life-threatening bleeding (Class I, Level B evidence). Supportive care includes blood pressure control (target <140 mm Hg), reversal of coagulopathy, and neurosurgical consultation. PCC or FFP are second\u2010line if idarucizumab unavailable.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for re\u2010bleeding and thrombotic risks for at least 72 hrs. Re\u2010evaluate need for anticoagulation after stabilization: balance recurrent stroke vs bleeding risk. Follow\u2010up CT at 24 hrs post-reversal. Long\u2010term anticoagulation strategy should involve multidisciplinary assessment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Idarucizumab is the only approved dabigatran antidote\u2014administer promptly in ICH. 2. Lab tests: thrombin time >60 s indicates dabigatran effect; normalization post\u2010idarucizumab confirms reversal. 3. PCC is ineffective for dabigatran reversal and may increase thrombotic risk. 4.

In cerebellar hemorrhages \u22653 cm causing mass effect on the fourth ventricle and decreased consciousness, AHA/ASA guidelines (Hemphill et al. 2015) give a Class I recommendation for suboccipital decompression and hematoma evacuation. Mannitol (A) and hypertonic saline (C) provide temporizing reduction in intracranial pressure but do not address surgical mass effect; they are Class IIb recommendations when surgery is contraindicated. Elevating the head and monitoring (D) alone is insufficient given impending brainstem compression. Randomized series (Auer et al. 1989) show improved survival and functional outcome with timely surgical evacuation compared to medical management alone (mortality reduction from ~80% to ~40%).","conceptual_foundation":"An understanding of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) classification, particularly cerebellar ICH, is required. According to the WHO and ICD-11, spontaneous ICH is coded under intracranial hemorrhage. Cerebellar strokes represent <10% of ICH, often due to hypertension-induced small vessel rupture in the posterior circulation (PICA territory). Key neuroanatomy includes the fourth ventricle, cerebellar peduncles, and brainstem nuclei; hematoma expansion leads to obstructive hydrocephalus and downward herniation. Embryologically, the rhombic lip gives rise to the cerebellum; vascular supply from PICA is critical in the posterior fossa.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebellar function involves coordination via Purkinje cell output to deep nuclei and the vestibular system. In hypertensive hemorrhage, fibrinoid necrosis of small arterioles leads to vessel rupture, blood extravasation, mass effect, and increased local pressure. Hematoma expansion compresses the fourth ventricle, causing obstructive hydrocephalus, increased ICP, and brainstem compromise. Cytotoxic edema further exacerbates pressure. Surgical evacuation relieves mass effect, restores CSF flow, and prevents transtentorial and tonsillar herniation.","clinical_manifestation":"Cerebellar hemorrhage presents with acute headache, vomiting, ataxia, dysarthria, and decreased consciousness. NIHSS underestimates posterior fossa deficits. Signs of raised ICP include altered mental status and Cushing triad. The natural history without surgery often leads to rapid deterioration and death within hours. A key presentation is obstructive hydrocephalus signs\u2014papilledema and downward gaze palsy.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast head CT is first-line: identifies hyperdense blood in the cerebellum, measures hematoma size, and assesses ventricular compression. CT angiography can exclude vascular lesions if stable. MRI is not indicated emergently. Serial CTs monitor hematoma expansion. Hydrocephalus is identified by ventricular enlargement. Bedside ultrasound has no role.","management_principles":"AHA/ASA guidelines recommend immediate neurosurgical consultation (Class I). Surgical evacuation via suboccipital craniectomy with hematoma removal is indicated for hematomas >3 cm with neurological deterioration. Mannitol or hypertonic saline can be used as temporizing measures (Class IIb). Blood pressure control to <140 mmHg systolic is recommended (INTERACT2 trial). EVD placement may be needed for persistent hydrocephalus.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative ICU monitoring: neurological checks hourly, repeat CT at 24 hours or earlier if deterioration. Blood pressure management, DVT prophylaxis, and swallow evaluation are essential. Rehabilitation focuses on balance and gait. Secondary stroke prevention includes antihypertensive therapy, statins, and diabetes control.","clinical_pearls":"1. Cerebellar hemorrhages >3 cm with brainstem compression require surgery (Class I). 2. Mannitol is temporizing; only definitive evacuation reduces mortality. 3. NIHSS may miss posterior fossa deficits\u2014always correlate clinically. 4. Rapid BP lowering to target <140 mmHg reduces hematoma expansion risk. 5.

Thunderclap headache with third nerve palsy and ipsilateral dilated pupil strongly suggests a Pcom aneurysm compressing the oculomotor nerve. Microvascular ischemia (A) causes pupil-sparing palsy. Pituitary apoplexy (C) produces headache and ophthalmoplegia but often involves visual field defects and hormonal abnormalities. Midbrain stroke (D) can cause oculomotor deficits but less commonly thunderclap headache and pupillary dilation. Digital subtraction angiography or CTA confirms aneurysm.","conceptual_foundation":"Third nerve palsy etiologies are classified by location: nerve-ischemic (microvascular) vs compressive. Compressive lesions (aneurysms, tumors) involve peripheral parasympathetic fibers leading to pupil involvement. The Pcom arises from the internal carotid, adjacent to the oculomotor nerve in the interpeduncular cistern. Subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured Pcom aneurysm causes thunderclap headache. ICD-11 classifies subarachnoid hemorrhage under intracranial hemorrhage; ophthalmoplegia under cranial neuropathies.","pathophysiology":"Rupture or mass effect of a Pcom aneurysm produces local compression of cranial nerve III, particularly the superficial parasympathetic fibers, causing pupillary dilation and unreactive pupil. Subarachnoid blood triggers meningeal irritation and thunderclap headache. In contrast, microvascular ischemia spares the periphery, preserving pupil function. Pituitary apoplexy stems from hemorrhage/infarct in an adenoma, increasing sellar pressure, affecting optic chiasm and cavernous sinus structures.","clinical_manifestation":"Thunderclap headache is sudden onset, peaking within seconds. Oculomotor palsy manifests as ptosis, 'down and out' eye position, diplopia, and blown pupil. SAH may include neck stiffness and photophobia. Pituitary apoplexy often presents with visual field loss, altered mental status, and hormonal deficiencies. Midbrain infarction presents with dorsal midbrain signs (Parinaud syndrome) rather than isolated third nerve palsy.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast CT head is first for SAH (sensitivity ~95% within 24 hrs). If CT-negative and suspicion high, perform lumbar puncture (xanthochromia). CTA or MRA identifies aneurysm; DSA is gold standard. Pituitary MRI for apoplexy. Diffusion MRI for midbrain infarct.","management_principles":"SAH from Pcom aneurysm requires nimodipine to prevent vasospasm and early aneurysm securing via endovascular coiling or surgical clipping. Blood pressure control is key. Pituitary apoplexy management includes high-dose corticosteroids and urgent neurosurgical decompression if vision threatened. Microvascular palsy management is supportive with diabetic control; spontaneous recovery occurs in weeks to months.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-SAH monitoring in neuro-ICU with transcranial Doppler for vasospasm, serial neurologic exams, and follow-up angiography. Long-term follow-up includes BP control and smoking cessation. Pituitary apoplexy follow-up requires endocrine evaluation. Microvascular palsy: monitor for recovery at 3-month intervals.","clinical_pearls":"1. Pupil involvement distinguishes compressive third nerve palsy. 2. Thunderclap headache is nearly pathognomonic for SAH. 3. Early CT within 6 hrs of headache onset approaches 100% sensitivity. 4. Nimodipine improves outcomes after SAH. 5.

In SLE patients on corticosteroids with nephritis, hypercoagulability is common, and CVT often presents with headache, altered mental status, seizures, and papilledema. LP findings of mildly elevated protein and normal cell count are nonspecific and can be seen in CVT without evidence of central infection. SLE cerebritis usually has inflammatory CSF changes and often fever; PRES is typically associated with severe hypertension or immunosuppressive medications and shows characteristic posterior white matter changes on MRI; HSV encephalitis presents with fever, focal temporal signs, and high lymphocytic pleocytosis on CSF.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral venous thrombosis arises from thrombosis of the dural sinuses or cerebral veins. SLE is a prothrombotic autoimmune disease, often with antiphospholipid antibodies. Nephrotic syndrome and high-dose steroids further increase thrombosis risk. In the ICD-11, CVT is classified under cerebrovascular disorders. Differential diagnoses include arterial stroke, infectious encephalitis, and PRES. Historically CVT was underrecognized due to variable presentations and paucity of imaging modalities.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, cerebral venous sinuses drain deoxygenated blood and CSF. Thrombosis impedes venous outflow, raising intracranial pressure, leading to headache, papilledema, and venous infarcts that precipitate seizures. Hypercoagulable states, endothelial injury, and stasis (Virchow's triad) contribute. In SLE with nephritis, proteinuria leads to antithrombin loss; steroids induce endothelial dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"CVT may present subacutely over days with headache (90%), seizures (40\u201350%), altered mentation (30\u201340%), focal deficits, and papilledema.
