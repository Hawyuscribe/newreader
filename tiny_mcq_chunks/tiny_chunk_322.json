[{"question_number":"1","question":"A young male patient presents with eyelid myotonia that increases after eating ice cream or exposure to cold. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Paramyotonia congenita","Myotonic dystrophy","Congenital myopathy","Periodic paralysis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Paramyotonia congenita","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. Paramyotonia congenita, an autosomal dominant SCN4A sodium channelopathy, presents with paradoxical myotonia that worsens with exercise and cold exposure, often affecting eyelids and facial muscles after ingesting cold foods like ice cream. Myotonic dystrophy (Option B) features multisystem involvement, muscle wasting, and conduction defects, not cold-induced eyelid stiffness alone. Congenital myopathy (Option C) refers to structural muscle diseases (e.g., nemaline myopathy) lacking true myotonia. Periodic paralysis (Option D) presents with episodic weakness without myotonia.","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita is classified under hereditary ion channel myotonias (ICD-11 C72.Z), distinct from chloride channel myotonias (myotonia congenita). It is caused by gain-of-function mutations in SCN4A leading to impaired rapid inactivation of Nav1.4 sodium channels at low temperatures. Related disorders include hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and potassium channel\u2013related syndromes. The concept of temperature-dependent channel gating underlies the paradoxical response to cold.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle action potentials rely on rapid activation and inactivation of sodium channels. Paramyotonia congenita mutations slow inactivation, causing repetitive firing on depolarization. Cold temperatures further stabilize the open state of Nav1.4 channels, exacerbating myotonia. With continued exercise, depolarization inactivates more channels, leading to transient weakness separate from myotonia, differentiating it from warm-up phenomenon in myotonia congenita.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients experience stiffness and eyelid closure on exposure to cold or after eating ice\u2010cold foods, often within seconds to minutes. Repeated activity worsens stiffness (paradox), and episodes can last up to hours. Some may develop transient weakness following prolonged cold exposure. There is no systemic or cardiac involvement.","diagnostic_approach":"EMG shows continuous myotonic potentials that increase in frequency and amplitude with cooling of the tested limb. Genetic testing for SCN4A mutations confirms diagnosis in >80% of cases. Provocative cold-water testing during EMG increases diagnostic sensitivity to >95%.","management_principles":"Avoidance of cold and wearing warm clothing are first-line. Pharmacologic treatment includes mexiletine (200 mg TID), which stabilizes sodium channel inactivation (Level B, AAN 2012). Acetazolamide may help in some SCN4A mutations but less predictable. No role for ergogenic agents.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual neuromuscular follow-up to monitor symptom frequency, medication side effects, and counsel on lifestyle triggers. Genetic counseling for family planning is recommended due to AD inheritance.","clinical_pearls":"1. Paradoxical myotonia (worsening with exercise) is key to paramyotonia congenita. 2. SCN4A mutations slow Nav1.4 inactivation; cold exacerbates open-state stability. 3. Cold-water EMG testing increases diagnostic yield. 4. Mexiletine improves symptoms by ~60% in randomized trials. 5. Avoidance of cold exposures is the most effective nonpharmacologic measure.","references":["1. Cannon SC. Pathomechanisms in channelopathies of skeletal muscle and brain.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Presynaptic NMJ"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Presynaptic NMJ","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. A presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder describes botulism, which presents with dilated pupils, bulbar involvement (dysphagia), and descending symmetric weakness. The toxin blocks acetylcholine release from presynaptic terminals. Other NMJ disorders are postsynaptic (myasthenia gravis) or synaptic (Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome).","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromuscular junction disorders are classified by site of dysfunction: presynaptic (botulism), synaptic (Lambert\u2013Eaton), postsynaptic (myasthenia gravis). Botulism is due to Clostridium botulinum toxin, classified under ICD-11 code 1E60.3. Differential includes GBS, MG, LEMS.","pathophysiology":"Botulinum toxin cleaves SNARE proteins (SNAP-25) in presynaptic terminals, preventing ACh vesicle fusion and release. This leads to failure of neuromuscular transmission, causing flaccid paralysis. Pupillary and autonomic fibers are affected early, leading to dilated pupils and dry mouth.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is 12\u201336 hours post-exposure with cranial nerve palsies: blurred vision, diplopia, ptosis is less common than mydriasis, dysphagia, dysarthria, followed by descending symmetrical paralysis. Sensory examination is intact; mental status remains clear.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical; confirm with serum toxin assay or stool culture. Electrophysiology shows incremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation at high frequencies. Pulmonary function tests (vital capacity) guide respiratory support.","management_principles":"Administer heptavalent antitoxin as soon as botulism is suspected to neutralize circulating toxin. Provide meticulous supportive care, with mechanical ventilation as needed. Elimination of toxin source and wound debridement in wound botulism. No proven role for immunotherapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor respiratory function hourly until stable. Wean ventilation based on vital capacity and negative inspiratory force. Rehabilitation for motor recovery may take weeks to months. Follow serial electrophysiology if needed.","clinical_pearls":"1. Botulism causes mydriasis with impaired accommodation.\n2. Descending paralysis differentiates from GBS (ascending).\n3. SNAP-25 cleavage is specific mechanism of botulinum toxin.\n4. Early antitoxin administration reduces mortality.\n5. EMG shows facilitation on high-frequency stimulation.","references":"1. Sobel J. Botulism. Clin Infect Dis. 2005;41(8):1167\u20131173. DOI:10.1086/444507\n2. Lu JW, Chiu TF, Hsu CW, et al.

Option B (Anti-MAG) is associated with demyelinating sensory ataxic neuropathy. Option C (Anti-AChR) is pathognomonic for myasthenia gravis.

Their presence supports the diagnosis of MMN but is not required if electrophysiology is diagnostic.","pathophysiology":"IgM anti-GM1 binding at the nodes of Ranvier activates complement, causing focal disruption of the myelin sheath and conduction failure in motor fibers, without primary sensory involvement.","clinical_manifestation":"Seropositive MMN patients present identically to seronegative cases: asymmetric distal weakness in upper limbs, preserved sensation, and conduction block on NCS.","diagnostic_approach":"Serum testing for anti-GM1 IgM has sensitivity ~50% and specificity >90% for MMN.
