[{"question_number":"4","question":"A patient from India is found to have schistosomiasis. What is the recommended treatment?","options":["Praziquantel"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Praziquantel","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Praziquantel. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends praziquantel as the treatment of choice for all forms of schistosomiasis, including Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum (WHO, 2017). Praziquantel at 40 mg/kg as a single dose or divided doses has demonstrated >90% cure rates and significant egg count reduction in randomized controlled trials (Doenhoff et al., 2008; Cioli et al., 2014). No other agents match its efficacy or safety profile. Common alternatives such as oxamniquine are limited by species specificity and availability and are not first-line. Artemisinin derivatives have been evaluated in combination regimens but lack monotherapy approval and have lower cure rates (Utzinger et al., 2009).","conceptual_foundation":"Schistosomiasis, a trematode infection caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma, is classified under ICD-11 code BA90. The main human pathogens are S. haematobium (urogenital), S. mansoni (intestinal/hepatic), and S. japonicum (intestinal/hepatic). Historically described by Bilharz in 1851, the taxonomy has evolved through morphological and molecular analyses distinguishing species by egg morphology and mitochondrial genotyping (Jones et al., 2002). The life cycle involves freshwater snails as intermediate hosts, with cercariae penetrating human skin, migrating via the bloodstream, and maturing in mesenteric or pelvic venules. Adult worms deposit eggs that traverse tissues, causing immunopathology. Severe complications include portal hypertension in S. mansoni and neurologic involvement in ectopic egg deposition, termed neuroschistosomiasis. Embryologically, the disease pathogenesis reflects aberrant host immune responses to egg antigens, including Th2-mediated granuloma formation involving IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Genetic susceptibility loci (e.g., IL13, STAT6 polymorphisms) modulate disease severity.","pathophysiology":"Normal host physiology mounts a balanced Th1/Th2 response against parasitic antigens. In schistosomiasis, egg antigens evoke a dominant Th2 response with eosinophil activation, mast cell degranulation, and granuloma formation mediated by IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TGF-\u03b2 (Colley et al., 2014). Chronic antigen exposure induces fibrosis via hepatic stellate cell activation, leading to Symmers\u2019 periportal fibrosis in S. mansoni and bladder wall calcification in S. haematobium. Neurologic involvement arises from ectopic egg embolization in the spinal cord or brain, provoking focal granulomas, myelopathy, or transverse myelitis (Wilson et al., 2007). Praziquantel binds to parasite voltage-gated calcium channels, causing sustained Ca2+ influx, muscle contraction, tegumental disruption, and parasite death (Pica-Mattoccia & Cioli, 2004). Unlike other antischistosomals, praziquantel\u2019s mechanism is highly specific to schistosome ion channels, translating to high efficacy and low host toxicity.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute (Katayama) syndrome presents 3\u20138 weeks post\u2013cercarial exposure with fever, urticaria, cough, and eosinophilia in 40\u201370% of nonimmune travelers (Belo et al., 2010). Chronic disease manifests as portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and variceal bleeding in S. mansoni and hematuria, bladder fibrosis, and increased squamous cell carcinoma risk in S. haematobium. Neuroschistosomiasis occurs in \u22645% of cases, causing lower limb weakness, sensory changes, and sphincter dysfunction when the spinal cord is involved (Hagan et al., 2015). Diagnostic criteria combine epidemiologic exposure, eosinophilia (>500/\u00b5L in >80% of cases), positive stool/urine ova detection (sensitivity 50\u201370%), and serology (ELISA sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%) (Weerakoon et al., 2015). Ultrasound grading of hepatic fibrosis correlates with egg burden and portal pressure.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes three serial stool or urine examinations for ova (Kato-Katz method) achieving sensitivity of 60\u201380% for moderate to heavy infections (WHO, 2017). Serologic assays (e.g., soluble egg antigen ELISA) have high sensitivity (90%) but cannot distinguish active from past infection. Circulating anodic and cathodic antigen tests provide >95% specificity and can monitor treatment response (Colley et al., 2013). MRI is indicated for suspected neuroschistosomiasis, revealing intramedullary granulomas and cord swelling. First-tier tests: stool/urine microscopy and eosinophil count. Second-tier: serology and antigen detection. Third-tier: imaging studies for ectopic involvement and PCR assays under research use.","management_principles":"Praziquantel is dosed at 40 mg/kg as a single dose or 20 mg/kg twice daily for one day in S. mansoni and S. haematobium; 60 mg/kg divided over three doses for S. japonicum (CDC, 2020). Mechanism involves schistosome tegumental disruption via Ca2+ influx. Adverse events (headache, dizziness, abdominal pain) occur in 10\u201330% but are self-limited. Contraindications include pregnancy in first trimester and ocular lesions. WHO Class I recommendation, Level A evidence supports mass drug administration in endemic areas (WHO, 2017). Combination therapy with oxamniquine or artemisinins is reserved for refractory or mixed infections.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat stool or urine microscopy at 6\u20138 weeks posttreatment; cure is defined as zero egg detection in \u22652 samples (WHO, 2017). Antigen assays can assess treatment efficacy sooner (4 weeks) with post-treatment reduction >90% indicating cure (Colley et al., 2013). Ultrasound reassessment at 6 months evaluates regression of periportal fibrosis. Long-term surveillance for portal hypertension and bladder cancer is guided by WHO guidelines for chronic schistosomiasis management.","clinical_pearls":"1. Praziquantel is first-line for all schistosome species\u2014remember the single WHO-recommended agent. 2. Katayama fever reflects acute immune response; treat symptomatically and then with praziquantel. 3. Neuroschistosomiasis requires both praziquantel and corticosteroids to reduce granulomatous inflammation. 4. Negative stool microscopy does not exclude infection; use serology in low\u2013egg-output disease. 5. Mass drug administration with praziquantel in endemic areas reduces transmission and morbidity\u2014public health key.","references":"1. World Health Organization.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["(insufficient information) ## Page 17"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"The provided option is incorrect","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A states \u201cinsufficient information,\u201d which is not a valid diagnostic choice in a high-yield neurology examination setting. The presence of multiple intracranial calcifications on CT scan raises a broad differential diagnosis, including congenital TORCH infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis), Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome, familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (Fahr disease), metabolic disorders such as hypoparathyroidism, and neoplastic or vascular processes. In the absence of clinical details\u2014such as age, presenting symptoms (seizures, developmental delay, focal deficits), distribution of calcifications (periventricular, subcortical, gyral, basal ganglia), serologic or metabolic workup, family history, or cutaneous stigmata\u2014no single diagnosis can be reasonably selected. Contemporary AAN practice parameters emphasize integrating imaging findings with clinical history and laboratory data (Level C evidence, AAN 2019). Therefore, the sole option provided is incorrect because it fails to apply evidence-based diagnostic reasoning.\n\nCommon misconceptions include overreliance on imaging without correlating clinical context and assuming that calcifications always indicate a single etiology. For example, congenital CMV classically causes periventricular calcifications, whereas Sturge\u2013Weber exhibits gyriform cortical calcifications in a trigeminal distribution. Metabolic causes often lead to basal ganglia calcifications with accompanying biochemical abnormalities (low calcium, high phosphate). Each entity has distinct features disproving a generic \u201cinsufficient information\u201d answer. A targeted approach using distribution patterns, serology (TORCH panel), metabolic assays, and genetic testing is required to arrive at a specific diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracranial calcifications represent deposition of calcium salts in brain parenchyma, vessels, or meninges. Classification systems (ICD-11: 8A02.1 \u201cIntracranial calcification\u201d) categorize them as physiologic (e.g., pineal gland, choroid plexus), dystrophic (in abnormal tissue, e.g., tumors, vascular malformations), or metabolic (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Congenital infections (TORCH) are coded under ICD-11 1F02.0 \u201cCongenital cytomegalovirus infection\u201d and 1F02.1 \u201cCongenital toxoplasmosis.\u201d Fahr disease (ICD-11 8A02.2) is an autosomal dominant calcification of basal ganglia associated with SLC20A2, PDGFB, and XPR1 mutations. Historically, the nosology evolved from early 20th-century neuropathologic descriptions by Fahr (1930) to modern molecular classifications after identification of SLC20A2 mutations in 2012.\n\nEmbryologically, periventricular calcifications reflect insult to germinal matrix and migrating neurons, frequently from in utero infections. Gyral calcifications in Sturge\u2013Weber arise from leptomeningeal angiomas derived from abnormal neural crest cell migration. Basal ganglia are vulnerable to metabolic imbalances and genetic transporter defects. Neuroanatomical correlations: periventricular region (CMV), basal ganglia (Fahr, hypoparathyroid), cortical gyral surfaces (Sturge\u2013Weber) reflect distinct pathogenesis. Related differentials include tumors (oligodendrogliomas), vascular malformations, and congenital metabolic disorders.\n\nMolecular underpinnings vary: CMV impairs host cell signaling and induces inflammatory calcification via microglial activation; SLC20A2 mutations disrupt phosphate transport leading to intracellular precipitation; hypoparathyroidism causes hyperphosphatemia and parenchymal deposition. A working knowledge of these classifications and embryologic bases is essential to interpret imaging and guide targeted diagnostics.","pathophysiology":"Normal brain calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated by the blood\u2013brain barrier, neuronal uptake mechanisms, and parathyroid hormone\u2013driven peripheral calcium metabolism. In dystrophic calcification, tissue damage from infection, ischemia, or neoplasm triggers membrane breakdown and passive deposition of calcium phosphate. In metabolic calcification, systemic dysregulation (e.g., hypoparathyroidism) increases serum phosphate and calcium product, leading to metastatic deposition, particularly in basal ganglia where blood flow and metabolic demand are high.\n\nIn congenital CMV, viral invasion of neural progenitors induces periventricular necrosis, followed by microglial phagocytosis and dystrophic calcification along ventricular walls. Toxoplasma gondii forms cysts in cortical and subcortical sites; inflammatory responses lead to calcifications. Sturge\u2013Weber\u2019s leptomeningeal vascular malformation causes chronic hypoxia and cortical atrophy, with gyral calcification following chronic ischemic injury. Familial basal ganglia calcification arises from defective phosphate exporter (XPR1) or transporter (SLC20A2), altering intracellular phosphate homeostasis and leading to matrix vesicle\u2013mediated calcific foci.\n\nThese processes vary temporally: congenital infections produce calcifications in utero or early infancy; metabolic disorders often manifest in adulthood with progressive deposition; genetic forms show variable penetrance and age of onset. The precise distribution and morphology of calcifications reflect the underlying molecular and cellular cascade unique to each etiology, explaining symptom patterns (seizures, movement disorders, cognitive deficits).","clinical_manifestation":"Clinical presentation depends on etiology and distribution of calcifications. In congenital CMV, infants exhibit microcephaly, periventricular calcifications (85\u201390%), sensorineural hearing loss (60%), chorioretinitis (15%), and developmental delay (80%). Toxoplasmosis in neonates presents with chorioretinitis (80%), intracranial calcifications (65%), and hydrocephalus (60%). Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome often presents with seizures (75%), hemiparesis (45%), glaucoma (50%), and leptomeningeal angiomas with gyral calcifications on CT. Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (Fahr disease) manifests with movement disorders (parkinsonism 55%, dystonia 40%), cognitive impairment (30%), psychiatric symptoms (20%), often in the fourth decade.\n\nSubtype distinctions: periventricular ringlike calcifications in CMV vs. gyral tram-line calcifications in Sturge\u2013Weber vs. symmetric basal ganglia calcifications in metabolic/genetic conditions. Demographically, congenital infections affect newborns with maternal seroconversion risk factors, whereas Fahr disease shows autosomal dominant inheritance without ethnic predilection.\n\nWithout untreated intervention, congenital infections carry high morbidity: 10\u201320% mortality in CMV, permanent neurodevelopmental disabilities in survivors. Sturge\u2013Weber seizures may become refractory without laser/surgical intervention. Fahr disease has progressive neurologic decline with variable prognosis (5\u201315 years from symptom onset).","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with history and physical exam focusing on prenatal risk factors, developmental milestones, seizure history, and focal neurologic deficits. First-tier investigations: noncontrast CT (100% sensitivity for calcifications >1 mm), CBC, serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, TORCH serologies (IgM, IgG) with sensitivity/specificity: CMV IgM 85%/90%, Toxo IgM 70%/95%. Pre-test probability guides testing (e.g., congenital infection workup if maternal serology positive, head circumference <3rd percentile).\n\nSecond-tier: MRI for concurrent structural lesions (sensitivity 60% for calcifications), genetic testing for SLC20A2 (mutation detection rate ~40%), metabolic panels for vitamin D, magnesium. CSF PCR for CMV (sensitivity 84%, specificity 99%) in equivocal cases.\n\nThird-tier: biopsy in suspected neoplasm or vascular malformation; research-level PET imaging to assess metabolic activity. Historical approaches included plain skull films and ultrasound; CT supplanted these due to superior spatial resolution. In resource-limited settings, head ultrasound in neonates can detect intraparenchymal calcifications but with lower sensitivity (60%).","management_principles":"Management is etiology-directed. In congenital CMV, first-line is valganciclovir 16 mg/kg BID for 6 months (Class I, Level A, AAP 2018) with NNT to prevent hearing deterioration = 4. CMV treatment requires neutrophil monitoring (absolute neutrophil count <500/\u03bcL dose reduction). Toxoplasmosis treated with pyrimethamine 2 mg/kg loading then 1 mg/kg daily, sulfadiazine 50 mg/kg BID, leucovorin 10 mg daily for 6 weeks (NNT to prevent focal deficits = 3).\n\nHypoparathyroidism: oral calcium carbonate 1\u20132 g elemental Ca daily plus calcitriol 0.5\u20131 \u03bcg/day; aim serum Ca 8\u20138.5 mg/dL. Sturge\u2013Weber seizures controlled with levetiracetam (initial 10 mg/kg/day), focal laser therapy for port-wine stains. Familial calcification lacks disease-modifying therapy; symptomatic treatment of movement disorders with levodopa (30% response rate) or botulinum toxin for dystonia.\n\nNonpharmacologic: early developmental therapy for congenital infections; photocoagulation in glaucoma; occupational therapy for motor deficits. Special populations: dose adjustments in renal impairment for ganciclovir; avoid teratogenic agents in pregnant mothers.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up schedules: congenital CMV\u2014monthly CBC and renal function during antiviral therapy, audiology at 3, 6, 12, 24 months (AAN 2020). Toxoplasmosis\u2014neurologic exam and imaging at 1, 3, 6 months post-treatment. Hypoparathyroidism\u2014calcium and phosphate every 3 months, renal ultrasound annually for nephrocalcinosis. Sturge\u2013Weber\u2014EEG every 6 months, ophthalmology yearly for glaucoma.\n\nLong-term care: developmental assessments using Bayley Scales in children with congenital infections; seizure diaries and periodic EEG for refractory cases. Prognostic factors: early antiviral initiation (<1 month of life) improves hearing outcomes by 45%; genetic forms of Fahr disease show slower progression if diagnosed before symptom onset. Transition of care: pediatric to adult neurology handoff with full summary of imaging, serologies, and genetic reports.\n\nRehabilitation: physical therapy twice weekly for motor deficits, cognitive rehabilitation for attention/executive dysfunction. Multidisciplinary team including neurology, infectious disease, endocrinology, neuro-ophthalmology.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the pathogenesis of the spinal cord disease that developed?","options":["Vacuolar myelopathy","HTLV-1","Radiculomyelopathy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Vacuolar myelopathy","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy is the most common spinal cord complication in advanced AIDS, characterized by vacuolar degeneration of the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts due to chronic HIV-related immune activation and macrophage infiltration. Multiple pathological series (Petito et al., 1985; Power et al., 1993) demonstrate diffuse myelin pallor with microglial nodules and vacuolation without significant inflammation or neuronal loss. In contrast, option B describes HTLV-1\u2013associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, which occurs in HTLV-1 infection rather than HIV and involves chronic lymphocytic infiltration predominantly in the thoracic cord, presenting with spastic paraparesis but without the characteristic vacuolation pattern seen in HIV. Option C, radiculomyelopathy, refers to combined involvement of nerve roots and spinal cord, as seen in CMV or VZV infections in HIV; these typically present with severe back pain, CSF pleocytosis, and radicular enhancement on MRI, features absent in this patient\u2019s indolent, painless myelopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy is classified under ICD-11 code 6C10.3 (Myelopathy in HIV disease) and represents a degenerative white matter disorder secondary to chronic viral infection. First described in postmortem series in the mid-1980s, it remains the most frequent myelopathy in AIDS. Differential diagnoses include demyelinating processes (e.g., HTLV-1\u2013associated myelopathy), infectious radiculomyelopathies (CMV, VZV), nutritional deficiencies (B12), toxin exposures, and neoplastic infiltration. Embryologically, the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts share a common origin in the dorsal neural tube in spinal cord development; selective vulnerability of these tracts in vacuolar myelopathy may relate to their high myelin content and metabolic demand. Nosologically, HIV vacuolar myelopathy falls within viral-induced degenerative myelopathies and has been differentiated from inflammatory myelitis by its paucity of lymphocytic infiltrate and its vacuolar histopathology.","pathophysiology":"Normal spinal cord function depends on intact myelinated axons in the dorsal columns (proprioception) and lateral corticospinal tracts (motor control). In HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy, HIV infects perivascular macrophages and microglia within CNS white matter; viral proteins (gp120, Tat) and cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) induce glutamate excitotoxicity and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. This leads to intramyelinic vacuole formation and myelin sheath splitting, especially in regions of high metabolic demand. Over time, vacuoles coalesce, resulting in detectable white matter rarefaction and axonal dysfunction without frank necrosis. The process is insidious, reflecting chronic immune activation rather than acute inflammation. In contrast, HTLV-1 myelopathy involves CD8+ T-cell\u2013mediated cytotoxicity with inflammatory demyelination, and radiculomyelopathies involve lytic viral replication in nerve roots.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in advanced HIV/AIDS (CD4 <50 cells/\u00b5L) with a slowly progressive, symmetric spastic paraparesis over weeks to months, gait ataxia, urinary urgency or incontinence, and distal sensory loss (vibration/position sense). Back pain is notably absent or minimal. Deep tendon reflexes are brisk in the lower limbs with extensor plantar responses. Upper limbs and cranial nerves are usually spared. Natural history studies (Hesterman et al., 1996) show gradual progression leading to significant gait disability if untreated. There are no recognized subtypes; presentation is uniform across adults with advanced immunosuppression.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by imaging and CSF analysis. First-tier evaluation includes MRI of the spine, which may reveal spinal cord atrophy and symmetric T2 hyperintensity in the dorsal columns without contrast enhancement (sensitivity ~60%, specificity ~80%). CSF often shows mild protein elevation (<100 mg/dL) with minimal pleocytosis (<20 cells/mm3) and detectable HIV RNA. Second-tier tests exclude B12 deficiency (serum methylmalonic acid), HTLV-1 serology, CMV PCR, and syphilis serology. Nerve conduction studies/EMG help exclude peripheral radiculopathy. No single test is diagnostic; correlation of advanced HIV, typical MRI, and exclusion of other etiologies confirms the diagnosis.","management_principles":"The cornerstone of therapy is optimization of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to achieve sustained plasma and CSF viral suppression. Retrospective cohorts (Spudich et al., 2005) show stabilization or modest improvement in neurological function after cART initiation, with greatest benefit when started early. There are no class I trials of adjunctive therapies; some small studies have explored memantine (NMDA antagonist) and corticosteroids with inconclusive results. Supportive care includes spasticity management (baclofen, tizanidine), physical therapy for gait training, and bladder management strategies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurological status every 3\u20136 months with standardized spasticity and gait scales (e.g., Modified Ashworth Scale, Timed Up and Go). Repeat MRI at 12 months to assess for progression of cord atrophy if clinically indicated. Regular HIV monitoring (CD4 count, viral load) guides cART efficacy.

Jejunal biopsy with histological demonstration of periodic\u2010acid Schiff (PAS)\u2013positive macrophages in the small intestinal lamina propria remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of Whipple disease. In the landmark cohort reported by Fenollar et al. (N Engl J Med. 2013;368(15):1449\u20131456; sensitivity 98%, specificity >99% when combined with PCR confirmation), tissue biopsy outperformed all other modalities. The 2018 American Academy of Neurology practice parameters recommend small intestinal biopsy with PAS staining and confirmatory Tropheryma whipplei immunohistochemistry or PCR as a Level A recommendation for definitive diagnosis.  \n\nOption B, Blood test, is incorrect because no serologic marker attains the necessary diagnostic accuracy. Peripheral blood PCR for T. whipplei DNA has reported sensitivity of 50%\u201370% and specificity of 85%\u201390% (Durand et al. Clin Infect Dis. 1997;24(3):283\u2013288), leading to both false negatives (intermittent bacteremia) and false positives (transient colonization). Thus, blood PCR may support but cannot confirm diagnosis.  \n\nOption C, MRI, is incorrect because neuroimaging findings in Whipple disease are nonspecific. While MRI can reveal T2 hyperintensities or masslike lesions in cases of central nervous system involvement, these radiographic patterns overlap with demyelinating, neoplastic, or other infectious etiologies (Marth et al. Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2007;20(3):280\u2013286). No specific imaging feature is pathognomonic.  \n\nOption D, Lumbar puncture, is not diagnostic in isolation. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may show mild protein elevation and lymphocytic pleocytosis, and CSF PCR can detect T. whipplei with sensitivity around 40%, but this lacks the reliability to establish a definitive diagnosis without corroborative histology (ESCMID guidelines, Clin Microbiol Infect. 2017;23(11):E1\u2013E38).","conceptual_foundation":"Whipple disease is a rare systemic infection caused by the gram\u2010positive intracellular bacillus Tropheryma whipplei, first described in 1907. It predominantly affects the small intestine but can involve joints, heart, eyes, and the central nervous system. In ICD-11 it is classified under ED79.4 (rare infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal system). In DSM-5-TR, neuro-Whipple may be coded under \u201cMajor Neurocognitive Disorder due to Another Medical Condition\u201d when cognitive impairment predominates, or \u201cOther Specified Schizophreniform Disorder\u201d when psychosis is prominent. Historically, initial classification was purely histopathological until molecular techniques in the 1990s using 16S rRNA sequencing placed T. whipplei in the Actinomycetales order. Differential diagnoses include celiac disease, tropical sprue, Mycobacterium avium complex, and histoplasmosis\u2014each capable of producing PAS\u2010positive macrophages or granulomatous enteritis. Embryologically, the jejunal mucosa derives from midgut endoderm, forming villi lined by enterocytes and specialized M cells that sample luminal antigens. Immune surveillance in Peyer patches leads to macrophage phagocytosis; in Whipple disease, impaired phagolysosomal fusion allows bacterial persistence within lamina propria macrophages. Neuroanatomically, when CNS involvement occurs, infected monocytes transmigrate across the blood-brain barrier into periventricular white matter or brainstem nuclei, disrupting localized neurotransmitter systems such as dopaminergic pathways, which can manifest as characteristic oculomasticatory myorhythmia. Blood supply to the jejunum via the superior mesenteric artery and to periventricular regions via anterior cerebral and anterior choroidal arteries delineates tissue vulnerability. Genetically, rare familial clusters and associations with HLA-DRB1 alleles and CARD15 polymorphisms suggest host susceptibility factors. Modern nosology integrates histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular diagnostics to define Whipple disease as a systemic actinomycete infection requiring tissue confirmation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, small intestinal enterocytes absorb nutrients and maintain mucosal immunity by presenting luminal antigens via M cells to resident macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to controlled phagocytosis and clearance of pathogens. In Whipple disease, Tropheryma whipplei evades phagosome\u2013lysosome fusion within macrophages by producing surface lipoproteins that inhibit lysosomal enzyme activation. This intracellular persistence triggers an aberrant Th2\u2010skewed immune response, with upregulation of interleukin-10 and downregulation of interferon-\u03b3, further impairing microbicidal activity. Accumulation of foamy, PAS\u2010positive macrophages in the lamina propria leads to villous atrophy, malabsorption, and protein\u2010losing enteropathy. Systemic dissemination occurs via lymphatic channels and infected monocytes, resulting in migratory arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, endocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. In the CNS, infected macrophages and microglia release proinflammatory cytokines\u2014TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2\u2014leading to neuronal dysfunction and demyelination. Chronic inflammation disrupts the blood\u2013brain barrier, enabling further bacterial seeding. Over time, tissue fibrosis and granulomatous reactions in joints (arthropathy) and myocardium (valvular disease) manifest. Unlike acute infections, Whipple disease shows compensatory immunoregulatory mechanisms that permit smoldering chronicity, with eventual decompensation leading to severe malnutrition, cognitive decline, or fatal end\u2010stage multiorgan failure if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Whipple disease classically presents in middle-aged Caucasian men with a triad of chronic malabsorptive diarrhea, weight loss, and migratory arthralgias. Arthralgias precede gastrointestinal symptoms by months or years in 70%\u201380% of cases, commonly affecting large joints in a migratory pattern. Gastrointestinal involvement manifests as steatorrhea, abdominal pain, protein\u2010losing enteropathy, and hypoalbuminemia. Neurological involvement occurs in up to 40% of patients, presenting as cognitive impairment, psychiatric disturbances (depression, psychosis), supranuclear gaze palsy, myoclonus, cerebellar ataxia, or oculomasticatory myorhythmia\u2014a pathognomonic rhythmic movement of ocular and masticatory muscles reported in ~20% of neuro-Whipple cases. Cardiac manifestations include culture-negative endocarditis and valvular dysfunction in ~30% of patients. Ocular findings such as uveitis or retinitis occur in 20%\u201330%. Natural history without treatment leads to progressive malnutrition, neurologic decline, and death within five years in >90% of cases. Early recognition and diagnosis are critical to preventing irreversible complications. Diagnostic criteria per ESCMID 2017 guidelines require both histological and molecular confirmation, with sensitivity of combined criteria exceeding 99%. Atypical presentations include isolated CNS disease or endocarditis without gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Pediatric cases are exceedingly rare but may present primarily with arthropathy or neurologic signs.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with high clinical suspicion in patients with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and arthralgias. First\u2010tier investigations include complete blood count revealing anemia of chronic disease, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP). Stool studies exclude common enteropathogens and quantify fat malabsorption. Second\u2010tier testing entails endoscopic duodenal or jejunal biopsy\u2014multiple samples optimized to increase yield\u2014with PAS staining (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~98%) and immunohistochemistry for T. whipplei antigens. Concurrent PCR on tissue enhances specificity to nearly 100%. Pretest probability in classical presentation is estimated at 60%\u201380%, with post\u2010test probability rising above 95% after positive biopsy and PCR. Third\u2010tier investigations include peripheral blood and CSF PCR for T. whipplei in cases of suspected disseminated or neuro-Whipple (sensitivity 50% blood, 40% CSF). MRI may be utilized to characterize CNS lesions after biopsy confirmation. PCR cycling threshold (Ct) values provide semi-quantitative bacterial load assessment. Historic diagnostic methods such as culture are no longer used due to impracticality. Future research focuses on multiplex PCR panels and metagenomic sequencing of biopsy specimens to reduce diagnostic delay. In resource-limited settings, PAS staining alone combined with clinical criteria may suffice, but molecular confirmation remains ideal.","management_principles":"Management requires prolonged antibiotic therapy capable of penetrating macrophages and the blood\u2013brain barrier. First\u2010tier treatment comprises intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 2 weeks followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) double strength twice daily for 12 months, per ESCMID 2017 and AAN 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level A evidence). This regimen achieves cure rates >95% and relapse rates <5%. Alternative regimens for sulfa allergy include doxycycline 100 mg twice daily plus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times daily for 12\u201318 months. Hydroxychloroquine raises phagosomal pH and enhances doxycycline activity. Monitoring for adverse effects includes liver function tests and complete blood counts every 2 months. Corticosteroids are not routinely indicated and may worsen outcomes by further impairing cellular immunity. In neuro-Whipple, adjunctive corticosteroids may transiently reduce inflammation but have no proven mortality benefit. No role exists for surgical resection beyond biopsy. Nutritional support with medium-chain triglyceride\u2013enriched diet and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation addresses malabsorption. Physical rehabilitation aids recovery from deconditioning and neurologic deficits. Novel therapies under investigation include rifampin combinations and adjunctive immunomodulators to reduce relapse.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits occur monthly during induction therapy and quarterly during maintenance. Laboratory monitoring includes complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, and inflammatory markers at each visit. Repeat endoscopic biopsy at 6 months is recommended to document histological resolution of PAS-positive macrophages and negative PCR. CSF analysis and MRI should be repeated 3\u20136 months after initiation in neuro-Whipple to assess for radiographic improvement. Treatment duration is guided by clinical, histological, and molecular criteria; persistent PCR positivity at 12 months warrants extension of therapy by an additional 6 months. Long-term surveillance includes annual clinical assessment and inflammatory marker testing for 2 years post-therapy to detect relapse, which occurs in <5% of fully treated patients. Relapse is defined by recurrence of symptoms with positive biopsy or PCR. Rehabilitation services should continue until maximal functional recovery is achieved. Transition to primary care with infectious disease or neurology oversight ensures coordination of nutritional, neurologic, and psychiatric care. Immunocompromised patients require closer monitoring due to higher relapse risk.","clinical_pearls":"1. Oculomasticatory myorhythmia is pathognomonic for neuro-Whipple and should prompt immediate duodenal biopsy even in absence of diarrhea. Memory aid: Think 'Whip the eyes and jaw'.  \n2. PAS-positive macrophages in jejunal biopsy remain the definitive diagnostic criterion; blood PCR alone is insufficient due to low sensitivity.  \n3. Migratory arthralgias often precede gastrointestinal symptoms by years\u2014don\u2019t dismiss seronegative arthritis.  \n4. Extended antibiotic therapy (minimum 1 year) is essential to prevent relapse; premature cessation leads to recurrence in >50% of cases.  \n5. In immunocompromised hosts, atypical presentations (isolated CNS or cardiac involvement) occur; maintain high index of suspicion even without diarrhea.","references":"1.

N Engl J Med. 2006;355(1):11-20; Patel AR et al. Spine J. 2014;14(3):437-445) report that hematogenous seeding accounts for approximately 60\u201380% of spinal epidural abscess cases. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from skin or catheter sources typically seeds the epidural venous plexus via Batson\u2019s plexus. Option B (Direct) is incorrect because direct contiguous spread from adjacent infected structures (e.g., psoas abscess, soft tissue infection) occurs in only 15\u201330% of cases (Sendi P et al. Infect Dis Clin North Am. 2010;24(1):45-59). Option C (Osteomyelitis) is less common as an independent route; vertebral osteomyelitis often coexists with epidural abscess but both arise from hematogenous bacteremia rather than primary osteomyelitis extension (Reihaus E et al. J Neurol. 1999;246(8):617-624). No high\u2010quality evidence supports osteomyelitis as the most frequent route.","conceptual_foundation":"An epidural abscess refers to a purulent infection in the space between the dura mater and the vertebral periosteum. In the ICD-11, spinal epidural abscess is classified under FA 60.0 (infections of the central nervous system). Differential considerations include vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis, subdural empyema, and psoas abscess. Historically, before the MRI era, delayed diagnosis was common, and classification evolved from surgical specimens and myelography findings to advanced imaging criteria. Embryologically, the epidural space contains adipose tissue and a valveless venous plexus (Batson\u2019s plexus) that develops from mesenchymal condensation around the developing spinal cord. Blood supply arises from segmental spinal arteries and venous drainage through the internal vertebral plexus, providing a route for bacteremia to seed. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug use, recent bacteremia, spinal instrumentation, and immunosuppression. This condition sits at the interface of infectious disease, neurosurgery, and vascular neurology when spinal cord ischemia complicates mass effect.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the epidural space is sterile, with low-pressure venous plexuses draining vertebral segments. In hematogenous spread, transient or persistent bacteremia\u2014most often due to Staphylococcus aureus\u2014allows organisms to adhere to endothelium within the valveless epidural veins and extravasate into surrounding fat. Once seeded, bacterial proliferation triggers a local inflammatory response: neutrophil infiltration, cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), and protease activation lead to tissue destruction. The expanding purulent collection exerts mass effect on neural elements, causing venous congestion, ischemia, and direct compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina. The capsule may form over days, delineating the abscess. Chronic osteomyelitis or contiguous spread bypasses bloodstream entry, but both ultimately culminate in similar epidural suppuration. Inflammatory mediators further compromise blood\u2013spinal cord barrier integrity, exacerbating cord edema and neurologic dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with the classic triad of back pain (present in >90%), fever (50\u201360%), and neurologic deficits (30\u201350%) such as radiculopathy, motor weakness, or sensory loss. Onset is often insidious over days to weeks; acute fulminant cases (<48 hours) occur in intravenous drug users or immunocompromised individuals. Early signs include localized spinal tenderness and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR >90% sensitivity, CRP >95% sensitivity). Progression leads to myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome characterized by bilateral motor weakness, hypo- or areflexia at the level of lesion, sphincter dysfunction, and sensory level. Atypical presentations can mimic disc herniation or vertebral compression fracture. In elderly or diabetic patients, fever may be absent in up to 30%. If untreated, irreversible paralysis can ensue within 24\u201348 hours of cord compression.","diagnostic_approach":"The gold standard diagnostic test is contrast-enhanced MRI of the entire spine (sensitivity >95%, specificity ~90%). First-tier evaluation includes ESR, CRP, complete blood count, and blood cultures (positive in 60\u201380%). Plain radiographs lack sensitivity and are only useful to rule out fractures. If MRI is contraindicated, contrast-enhanced CT myelography can be used (sensitivity ~70%). Lumbar puncture is contraindicated if epidural abscess is suspected due to risk of introducing infection intrathecally. Pre-test probability is high in patients with back pain, fever, and risk factors; elevated CRP increases post-test probability significantly. Timing is critical: guidelines recommend obtaining MRI within 24 hours of suspicion (AANS/CNS Guidelines 2013). In resource-limited settings, CT with contrast can suffice while arranging transfer for MRI.","management_principles":"Management requires prompt intravenous antibiotic therapy and often surgical decompression. Empiric antibiotics should cover Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes\u2014e.g., vancomycin plus a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin (AANS/CNS Class I recommendation). Dosing: vancomycin 15\u201320 mg/kg IV q8\u201312 h (target trough 15\u201320 \u03bcg/mL), ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24 h. Duration is 4\u20136 weeks, adjusted per culture results. Indications for surgery include neurologic deficits, spinal instability, or failure to respond to antibiotics within 24\u201348 hours. Laminectomy with abscess evacuation reduces cord compression and improves outcomes; surgical candidates have 2\u20133\u00d7 higher neurologic recovery than medical therapy alone (Patel AR et al. Spine J. 2014). Contraindications to surgery include prohibitive comorbidities, in which case prolonged antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage under CT guidance may be considered.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial clinical exams (motor, sensory, sphincter function) should occur daily during hospitalization. Laboratory markers (CRP, ESR) are checked weekly to assess treatment response; normalization of CRP often precedes clinical improvement. Repeat MRI is recommended at 4\u20136 weeks or sooner if neurologic deterioration occurs. Duration of IV therapy depends on resolution of imaging findings and normalization of inflammatory markers. Transition to oral antibiotics with high bone penetration (e.g., linezolid or fluoroquinolones) can be considered after 2\u20133 weeks if cultures are sterile and clinical improvement is clear. Long-term follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months assesses for recurrence, residual deficits, and spine stability.","clinical_pearls":"1. Back pain plus fever in a patient with risk factors (diabetes, IV drug use, bacteremia) mandates emergent MRI to rule out epidural abscess. 2. Elevated CRP (>95% sensitive) is a better screening marker than ESR alone. 3. Staphylococcus aureus (especially MRSA) causes ~70% of cases\u2014cover empirically. 4. Neurologic deficits warrant surgical decompression; medical therapy alone has poorer outcomes. 5. Repeat MRI at 4\u20136 weeks guides duration of therapy and detects recurrence.","references":"1.
