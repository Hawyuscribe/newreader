MMN is characterized by asymmetric distal motor weakness without sensory involvement and the presence of conduction block on nerve conduction studies (NCS). In this case, the patient\u2019s bilateral foot drop and left ulnar neuropathy with abductor digiti minimi weakness, together with NCS demonstrating conduction block in the ulnar and deep peroneal nerves, are classic for MMN. Primary literature (Dalakas MC, Muscle Nerve 2015) reports that conduction block is the hallmark electrophysiological finding in MMN, seen in over 80% of patients, and is required for diagnosis (Level A evidence, EFNS/PNS guidelines 2010). \n\nOption B (HNPP) is incorrect because while HNPP can present with focal neuropathies at compression sites, it typically involves both motor and sensory fibers and has a hereditary pattern (PMP22 deletion) with episodic symptoms beginning in adolescence or early adulthood. Sensory involvement and a positive family history would be expected. \n\nOption C (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) is a hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy with uniform slowing on NCS and both sensory and motor involvement; conduction block is not a feature. \n\nOption D (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) involves both upper and lower motor neuron signs, lacks demyelinating conduction blocks on NCS, and usually presents with mixed UMN/LMN findings rather than isolated multifocal motor conduction block.","conceptual_foundation":"Multifocal Motor Neuropathy is classified under acquired immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathies (ICD-11 code 8A44.21). It preferentially attacks motor fibers, sparing sensory pathways, and is distinct from CIDP by its asymmetric course and pure motor involvement. Differential diagnoses include MMN with conduction block, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), and motor neuron disease (e.g., ALS). MMN was first recognized in 1988 and formally defined in EFNS/PNS 2010 guidelines as requiring \u22651 motor conduction block in noncompressible segments. Embryologically, peripheral myelin derives from neural crest\u2013derived Schwann cells. MMN\u2019s demyelination is patchy and immune mediated. Neuroanatomically, MMN affects peripheral nerves at multiple sites (e.g., fibular head, cubital tunnel) where focal demyelination and conduction block occur. Molecularly, anti-GM1 IgM antibodies are present in ~50% of patients, implicating complement\u2010mediated Schwann cell damage. No known monogenic mutations have been identified in MMN, distinguishing it from hereditary neuropathies.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, Schwann cell\u2013derived myelin facilitates saltatory conduction. In MMN, an IgM\u2010mediated immune attack (often anti-GM1) targets nodal and paranodal regions of motor fibers, activating complement and recruiting macrophages that strip myelin sheaths. This focal demyelination produces conduction block (>50% drop in CMAP amplitude on proximal vs distal stimulation) without Wallerian degeneration initially. Over time, secondary axonal loss can occur. There is selective vulnerability of motor fibers due to higher GM1 density. In contrast, in HNPP (PMP22 deletion), myelin sheath instability predisposes to focal demyelination at compression sites, but sensory fibers are also affected. In ALS, degeneration is within anterior horn cells and corticospinal tracts, with denervation on EMG but no conduction block. Thus, conduction block and pure motor involvement are pathophysiologically specific to MMN.","clinical_manifestation":"MMN typically presents in adults (mean age ~40 years), male predominance (3:1). Patients develop slowly progressive, asymmetric distal limb weakness (e.g., wrist and finger extensors, toe dorsiflexors), often beginning unilaterally. There is an insidious course over months to years without sensory complaints. Reflexes may be reduced in affected muscles. No bulbar or respiratory involvement occurs unless very advanced. Natural history without treatment leads to progressive axonal loss and permanent weakness. By contrast, CIDP has symmetric proximal and distal weakness with sensory symptoms; ALS has mixed UMN/LMN signs and brisk reflexes.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Detailed clinical exam and nerve conduction studies. Criteria (EFNS/PNS 2010) require \u22651 motor conduction block in noncompressible segment with preserved sensory responses. Sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%. Anti\u2010GM1 IgM testing (supportive; positive in ~50%). CSF protein usually normal or mildly elevated. Second\u2010tier: MRI of peripheral nerves may show focal enlargement. Third\u2010tier: Nerve biopsy is rarely needed but may show segmental demyelination without inflammation. Pretest probability is high in middle-aged men with asymmetric pure motor symptoms; absence of sensory findings increases likelihood.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days, repeated every 4 weeks. Trials (van den Berg\u2010Vos RM et al., J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2006) show objective strength improvement in ~80% of patients (NNT ~1.3). Corticosteroids and plasma exchange are ineffective or harmful. Maintenance IVIG dosing is individualized (e.g., 1 g/kg every 2\u20136 weeks). Rituximab and subcutaneous immunoglobulin are second\u2010line options for refractory cases. Physical and occupational therapy optimize function and prevent contractures. Monitor for IVIG\u2010related complications (renal dysfunction, thrombosis).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be assessed before each infusion for strength (MRC scale) and function (Nine\u2010Hole Peg Test, 10\u2010m walk). NCS can be repeated every 6\u201312 months to monitor conduction block and axonal loss. Adjust IVIG dose or interval based on clinical response. Long\u2010term treatment is usually required to prevent relapse; tapering may be attempted after sustained remission (>2 years). Monitor for IVIG adverse events quarterly. Rehabilitation services to maintain muscle bulk and prevent joint contractures are recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. Conduction block in pure motor nerves with no sensory deficits is pathognomonic for MMN; do not confuse with CIDP.  2. Anti-GM1 IgM antibodies support the diagnosis but are absent in ~50% of cases\u2014clinical and electrophysiological criteria remain diagnostic.  3. IVIG is highly effective (NNT ~1.3) and first\u2010line; corticosteroids can worsen weakness.  4. Early treatment is critical to prevent irreversible axonal loss and long\u2010term disability.  5.

In hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), the pathognomonic histopathologic feature on sural nerve biopsy is the presence of tomacula\u2014focal, sausage-like thickenings of the myelin sheath. Multiple studies, including the foundational work by Shy et al. (1993) and later series (e.g., Fischer et al. 2002), demonstrate that tomacula are present in >80% of HNPP nerve biopsies. Tomacula form due to focal hyperfolding of redundant myelin in regions of PMP22 haploinsufficiency, and correlate with sites of nerve conduction block. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, although secondary axonal degeneration can occur in chronic HNPP, it is neither specific nor the primary finding; axonal loss is typically mild and secondary to repeated demyelinating insults. Option C is incorrect: HNPP demonstrates segmental demyelination rather than uniform demyelination of all fibers; generalized demyelination is characteristic of classical Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) rather than HNPP. Option D is incorrect because increased Schwann cell numbers (onion bulb formations) reflect chronic demyelination\u2013remyelination cycles seen in CMT1A and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), not HNPP. Common misconceptions include conflating all PMP22-related neuropathies as having similar biopsy findings, whereas HNPP has tomacula and CMT1A shows onion bulbs.\n\nAmerican Academy of Neurology practice parameters (2005) note that nerve biopsy in HNPP is seldom required when genetic testing is confirmatory but, when performed, tomacula are diagnostic (Level B evidence). Electrophysiologic correlation shows conduction block at compression sites with normal distal sensory amplitudes in many cases (sensitivity ~75%).","conceptual_foundation":"Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a dominantly inherited peripheral nerve disorder, classified in ICD-11 under neuromuscular diseases (8A60.0) and in the OMIM database as #162500. Phenotypically, HNPP sits within the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN) but differs from CMT1A by propensity for focal entrapment palsies rather than progressive distal weakness. Historically described by De Jong in 1947 and genetically characterized in the 1990s, HNPP arises from a 1.5-Mb deletion at chromosome 17p11.2 spanning the PMP22 gene, leading to PMP22 protein haploinsufficiency. Differential diagnoses include entrapment neuropathies (e.g., carpal tunnel), multifocal acquired demyelinating neuropathy (MMAD), and other inherited neuropathies. Embryologically, Schwann cells derive from the neural crest; PMP22 is critical for compact myelin formation in peripheral nerves. Tomacula represent focal redundancy of uncompacted myelin due to insufficient PMP22, and are most frequently seen in endoneurial regions subjected to mechanical stress (e.g., wrist, elbow). The molecular etiology ties directly to Schwann cell biology and myelin compaction, differentiating HNPP from axonal neuropathies and central myelin disorders.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of peripheral myelination relies on balanced expression of myelin proteins, notably PMP22, which comprises ~2\u20135% of peripheral myelin protein. In HNPP, heterozygous deletion of PMP22 reduces PMP22 mRNA and protein levels by ~50%, impairing the stability and compaction of the myelin sheath. At focal sites of nerve compression, stretched endoneurial connective tissue exacerbates myelin destabilization, leading to focal hyperfolding (tomacula). These myelin outfoldings produce conduction block via saltatory discontinuities. Repeated episodes of demyelination and remyelination may cause mild secondary axonal degeneration over time. In contrast, CMT1A (PMP22 duplication) shows chronic demyelination with onion bulb formation due to Schwann cell hyperplasia. In HNPP, cellular stress at entrapment sites amplifies Schwann cell dysfunction, triggering Schwann cell\u2013axon signaling cascades via neuregulin-1 and ErbB receptors; reduced PMP22 alters lipid raft composition and endosomal trafficking, further destabilizing myelin. The focal nature of tomacula versus diffuse changes in other neuropathies underscores the unique pathophysiology of HNPP.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinically, HNPP typically presents in the second or third decade with transient, recurrent mononeuropathies at sites of compression: peroneal palsy at the fibular head, ulnar palsy at the elbow, or carpal tunnel syndrome. Sensory symptoms (paresthesias, numbness) and mild motor weakness resolve over weeks to months but may recur. Approximately 15\u201320% of patients report minimal symptoms, discovered only through electrophysiologic screening or family history. Rarely, HNPP may manifest in infancy with congenital hypomyelination pattern, though most cases are adult-onset. Natural history studies (Li et al. 2004) show that >90% of acute palsies recover function within 6 months; however, repeated episodes may lead to incomplete recovery and mild chronic neuropathy. Diagnostic criteria rely on electrophysiologic evidence of segmental demyelination with conduction block and sensory slowing, corroborated by genetic testing. Nerve biopsy is now reserved for atypical cases; the presence of tomacula confirms the diagnosis with near-perfect specificity but moderate sensitivity depending on biopsy site.","diagnostic_approach":"The recommended diagnostic approach begins with clinical history of recurrent entrapment neuropathies and family history. Electrophysiology is first-tier: nerve conduction studies demonstrate focal conduction block, prolonged distal motor latencies, and mild generalized sensory slowing (sensitivities 70\u201390%, specificity ~85%). Genetic testing for PMP22 deletion by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the gold standard (sensitivity and specificity >99%). Nerve biopsy is third-tier: reserved for cases with negative or inconclusive genetic testing or unusual presentation; sural nerve sampling should target a segment free of previous entrapment to maximize yield. Tomacula have a biopsy sensitivity of ~60\u201380% and near-perfect specificity. Pre- and post-test probabilities vary: in patients with typical clinical features, pretest probability ~50%, with genetic testing raising post-test probability to >99%. Historical nerve biopsy techniques (e.g., teased-fiber analysis) have largely been supplanted by genetic assays. In resource-limited settings, nerve conduction plus family pedigree may suffice, with biopsy as fallback. Common pitfalls include misinterpreting mild axonal loss as primary axonal neuropathy and missing focal demyelination when sampling distal nerve segments.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy for HNPP; management is supportive and preventive. Current guidelines (European Federation of Neurological Societies, 2013) recommend patient education on avoiding prolonged pressure on nerves (e.g., crossing legs, leaning elbows), using ergonomic aids (wrist splints, knee pads), and tailored physiotherapy to maintain muscle strength and joint mobility. Analgesics or neuropathic pain agents (e.g., gabapentin) may be used for symptomatic relief. Genetic counseling is essential for family planning given autosomal dominant inheritance. No pharmacologic agent has been shown to upregulate PMP22 expression or reverse tomacula formation; experimental gene-therapy approaches (viral vector\u2013mediated PMP22 delivery) remain in preclinical stages. Management of acute palsies follows standard nerve injury protocols: splinting, physical therapy, and, rarely, surgical decompression when conduction block persists >3 months despite conservative measures. Pregnancy and pediatric cases require individualized ergonomic counseling and growth-related monitoring. Long-term prognosis is excellent, with most patients maintaining functional independence.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up focuses on monitoring for recurrent entrapment neuropathies and functional recovery. Initial follow-up after an acute palsy occurs at 4\u20136 weeks to assess conduction recovery; nerve conduction studies may be repeated at 3\u20136 months if clinical improvement is incomplete. Annual or biennial neurologic evaluations assess for new deficits. No routine laboratory or imaging surveillance is indicated. Occupational therapy reviews ergonomics annually or upon new symptom onset. Prognostic factors include age at onset (younger onset may have more recurrences), severity of initial palsies, and compliance with pressure-avoidance strategies. Transition of care includes referral to genetic counseling and, if needed, multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Education materials should emphasize red flags\u2014persistent weakness >3 months, new painless nerve deficits, or symptoms suggestive of CIDP\u2014that warrant re-evaluation. Quality-of-life assessments (e.g., Neuropathy-Specific QOL questionnaire) may be used annually in research settings but are not standard in clinical practice.","clinical_pearls":"1. Tomacula are the histopathologic hallmark of HNPP: remember \u201csausage myelin\u201d on biopsy confirms diagnosis.  2. PMP22 deletion causes HNPP, whereas PMP22 duplication causes CMT1A\u2014gene dosage matters.  3. Recurrent, transient mononeuropathies at common entrapment sites with complete or near-complete recovery in weeks are classic.  4. Genetic testing (MLPA/FISH) has >99% sensitivity/specificity and obviates the need for nerve biopsy in typical cases.  5. Avoid prolonged nerve compression (crossed legs, leaning elbows) to prevent attacks\u2014patient education is the cornerstone of management.","references":"1.

In myasthenia gravis (MG), pathogenic autoantibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) are detectable in approximately 80% to 85% of patients with generalized disease and about 50% of those with purely ocular symptoms, making the anti-AChR antibody assay the single best serological test (Gilhus NE. N Engl J Med. 2016;375(26):2570\u20132581). Single-fiber EMG (Option A) assesses neuromuscular transmission electrophysiologically but is not a serological test. Option C (associated muscle atrophy) is a clinical observation rather than a serological assay. Option D (commonest cause of myopathy in adults) is irrelevant to serological diagnostics and is factually incorrect as MG is not classified as a primary myopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibody-mediated impairment of neuromuscular transmission. In ICD-11 it is coded under autoimmune diseases of the neuromuscular junction (8E43). Clinically, MG presents with fatigable weakness, most prominently affecting ocular, bulbar, and proximal limb muscles. Differential diagnoses include Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome, congenital myasthenic syndromes, and motor neuron disease. Historically, MG was first described in the 19th century, and the discovery of AChR antibodies in 1973 transformed diagnosis and management.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, acetylcholine released from presynaptic vesicles binds postsynaptic AChRs, generating end-plate potentials that trigger muscle contraction. In MG, autoantibodies bind the AChR, leading to complement-mediated receptor destruction, accelerated endocytosis, and morphological simplification of the postsynaptic fold. This reduces the safety factor for neuromuscular transmission, causing fatigable weakness. Early in disease the impairment may be intermittent; as receptor loss progresses, weakness becomes more persistent.","clinical_manifestation":"MG typically presents with fluctuating, fatigable muscle weakness. Ocular involvement (ptosis, diplopia) occurs in >50% initially, and by two years up to 85% develop generalized weakness affecting bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles. Purely ocular MG accounts for about 20% of cases. Symptoms worsen with activity and improve with rest. A myasthenic crisis, defined by respiratory failure requiring ventilation, occurs in ~15-20% of patients during the disease course.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing: serum anti-AChR antibody assay (sensitivity 80% generalized, specificity >95%; Sanders DB et al.

Chest imaging (CT/MRI) to assess for thymoma is recommended in all patients.","management_principles":"Symptomatic therapy with pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is first line. Immunosuppression with corticosteroids (prednisone) and steroid-sparing agents (azathioprine, mycophenolate) is indicated for generalized disease (AAN practice parameter, 2016). Thymectomy is recommended in non-thymomatous generalized MG age <60 years (Randomized MGTX trial: 5-year benefit in remission rates; N Engl J Med. 2016;375(6):511\u2013522).

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)","Anti-muscle antibody Myasthenia Gravis","Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome","Botulism"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Anti-muscle antibody Myasthenia Gravis","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B, anti-muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) or acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody\u2013positive Myasthenia Gravis (MG), is the most likely diagnosis. MG commonly presents in young women with fatigable diurnal proximal muscle weakness, bulbar involvement (dysarthria, dysphagia), and sometimes tongue fasciculations due to repetitive motor end-plate activity. Primary literature (e.g., Sanders et al., 2018, JAMA Neurology) reports that >85% of generalized MG patients have AChR or MuSK antibodies with sensitivity of 80\u201390% and specificity >95%. In contrast, LEMS (Option A) typically affects older smokers with small-cell lung cancer, features autonomic dysfunction, and shows incremental response on EMG after exercise. Congenital myasthenic syndromes (Option C) present in infancy or early childhood without autoantibodies. Botulism (Option D) causes acute descending flaccid paralysis with pupillary involvement and autonomic signs, not a diurnal pattern.","conceptual_foundation":"Myasthenia Gravis is an acquired autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction characterized by autoantibodies directed against postsynaptic components (AChR or MuSK). It is classified in ICD-11 under autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders (8A64). Differential diagnoses include LEMS, congenital myasthenic syndromes, and neuromuscular toxins. Embryologically, the neuromuscular junction develops from motor neuron outgrowth from the spinal cord into muscle, with clustering of AChRs mediated by agrin and MuSK. Adult NMJ function depends on presynaptic release of acetylcholine, its binding to AChR, and rapid hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. The thymus plays a role in immunologic tolerance; thymic hyperplasia or thymoma is seen in MG.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuromuscular transmission involves quantal release of acetylcholine from presynaptic nerve terminals, binding to postsynaptic AChRs, and generation of end-plate potentials to trigger muscle contraction. In MG, autoantibodies (primarily IgG1 and IgG3) against AChR (or MuSK) cause receptor internalization, complement-mediated damage of the postsynaptic membrane, and reduced safety factor for neuromuscular transmission. Repetitive use further depletes receptor density, leading to fatigability. Fasciculations reflect increased local repolarization of adjacent muscle fibers in response to patchy denervation-like changes at the end-plate. Chronic receptor loss triggers compensatory upregulation of presynaptic acetylcholine release, but this is insufficient under sustained activity.","clinical_manifestation":"MG typically presents in young women (peak onset 20\u201330 years) with fluctuating, fatigable weakness. Ocular symptoms (ptosis, diplopia) occur in 60%, bulbar symptoms (dysarthria, dysphagia) in 50%, and generalized proximal limb weakness in 80%. Diurnal variation is classic, with worsening over the day and improvement after rest. Tongue fasciculations are less common but may be seen as small fasciculations due to focal end-plate membrane instability. MG courses vary: ocular MG (confined to eyes) vs generalized MG; MuSK-positive MG often has more prominent bulbar involvement.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing: serologic assays for AChR and MuSK antibodies (sensitivity ~85%, specificity >95%). Repetitive nerve stimulation shows a decrement >10% at 2\u20133 Hz. Single-fiber EMG demonstrates increased jitter and blocking (sensitivity >95%). Edrophonium (Tensilon) testing is largely historical. Chest imaging (CT or MRI) to assess thymus. Second-tier: antibody-negative cases may undergo MuSK, LRP4 antibody testing. Rarely, genetic testing for congenital syndromes if onset in childhood. Pretest probability high in a classic clinical picture, so antibody testing is first-line per AAN guidelines (2016, Level B).","management_principles":"First-line symptomatic therapy: pyridostigmine 30\u201360 mg orally every 4\u20136 hours; expect ~60% improvement in strength. Immunosuppression: prednisone starting at 20 mg daily, titrated to 1 mg/kg (Class I, Level A), azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day (onset 6\u201312 months), or mycophenolate mofetil. Thymectomy is recommended in AChR-positive generalized MG <60 years (MGTX trial, N Engl J Med 2016: 18% absolute risk reduction in generalized symptoms at 3 years). Refractory cases: rituximab for MuSK-positive patients, eculizumab for refractory AChR-positive MG (REGAIN trial). Acute crisis management: IVIG (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days) or plasmapheresis.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical status every 3\u20136 months or more frequently during therapy changes. Regular pulmonary function tests (FVC, negative inspiratory force) in bulbar MG. Laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressants (CBC, LFTs) every 1\u20133 months. Post-thymectomy: imaging at 6 months to ensure no residual tissue. Long-term: taper immunosuppression when stable for 1\u20132 years; relapses occur in ~30%. Transition care with pulmonology for chronic respiratory insufficiency.","clinical_pearls":"1. Diurnal fatigability improving with rest is pathognomonic for MG. 2. Thymectomy benefits AChR-positive generalized MG patients <60 years (MGTX trial). 3. MuSK-positive MG often has more bulbar involvement and poor response to thymectomy. 4. Single-fiber EMG is the most sensitive test for NMJ disorders (>95% sensitivity). 5. Eculizumab is approved for refractory AChR-positive MG (REGAIN trial).","references":"1.
