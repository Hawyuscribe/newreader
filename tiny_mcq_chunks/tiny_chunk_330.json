What is the mutation associated with this condition?","options":["Large deletion of mitochondrial DNA","Sporadic mutation in mitochondrial DNA","Mutation in ribosomal-related mitochondrial DNA ## Page 24"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Large deletion of mitochondrial DNA","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) often presents in childhood or adolescence with ptosis and external ophthalmoplegia and is most commonly caused by single large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Southern blot and long-range PCR studies have demonstrated that 80\u201390% of patients with sporadic CPEO harbor a single large-scale mtDNA deletion ranging from 1.3 to 10 kb.1\u20134 These deletions remove multiple genes encoding components of the electron transport chain, leading to deficient oxidative phosphorylation and selective vulnerability of extraocular muscles. In contrast, option B (\u201csporadic mutation in mitochondrial DNA\u201d) is too vague and does not specify the large-scale deletion characteristic of CPEO. Option C (\u201cmutation in ribosomal-related mitochondrial DNA\u201d) refers to mutations affecting mt-rRNA genes, which are classically seen in sensorineural hearing loss (e.g., A1555G) rather than in isolated external ophthalmoplegia.","conceptual_foundation":"Mitochondria are maternally inherited organelles containing a circular 16.6 kb genome encoding 13 polypeptides of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs (12S and 16S). The concept of heteroplasmy (coexistence of mutant and wild-type mtDNA) and threshold effect explains why tissues with high energy demand (e.g., extraocular muscles) manifest disease first. CPEO is classified under mitochondrial myopathies in ICD-11 (GA22.0) and DSM-5-TR does not apply. Differential diagnoses include myasthenia gravis, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Historically, the first large-scale mtDNA deletion was described in patients with Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome (KSS), a triad of CPEO, pigmentary retinopathy, and heart block, with onset before age 20.5\u20137","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, OXPHOS complexes I\u2013V generate ATP via the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Large-scale mtDNA deletions remove multiple protein-coding genes of complexes I, IV, and V, leading to impaired electron transport, decreased ATP synthesis, increased reactive oxygen species, and eventual fiber necrosis. Extraocular muscles are highly dependent on mitochondrial ATP due to their constant activity and abundant mitochondrial content. Deletion-bearing mitochondria clonally expand in postmitotic muscle fibers, leading to ragged-red fibers on modified Gomori trichrome staining and cytochrome c oxidase\u2013negative fibers on histochemistry.8\u201310","clinical_manifestation":"CPEO typically manifests between ages 5 and 20 with insidious, symmetric ptosis and limitation of upward, downward, and lateral gaze. Symptoms progress over years. In KSS (a CPEO variant), pigmentary retinopathy (salt-and-pepper fundus), conduction defects (heart block), cerebellar ataxia, and endocrine abnormalities (diabetes, hypoparathyroidism) are present.11\u201313 Pure CPEO lacks systemic involvement. Muscle biopsy shows ragged-red fibers in >90% of patients and elevated lactate on exercise testing in ~70%.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing includes muscle biopsy for histochemistry (ragged-red fibers, COX-negative fibers) and Southern blot or long-range PCR analysis for single large-scale mtDNA deletions (sensitivity ~85\u201390%, specificity ~95%).14 If negative, next-tier testing includes mtDNA sequencing to detect point mutations or multiple deletions and nuclear gene testing for POLG, TWNK, and other maintenance genes. Quantitative PCR can estimate heteroplasmy levels. Cardiac evaluation (ECG, echocardiogram) is essential in suspected KSS.15\u201317","management_principles":"No cure exists; management is supportive. Ptosis can be addressed surgically (levator resection or Muller's muscle advancement) when eyelid droop impairs vision. Eyelid crutches provide temporary relief. Extraocular muscle surgery has limited benefit due to progressive nature. Cardiac conduction defects require pacemaker implantation (Class I recommendation, Level B). Coenzyme Q10 and other mitochondrial cocktails (vitamins C, E, B vitamins) have limited evidence but are often used empirically.18\u201320","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require annual ophthalmologic assessments, cardiac monitoring (ECG every 6\u201312 months), endocrinologic screening (blood glucose, calcium), and audiology evaluations. Muscle strength and functional status should be reviewed at least annually. Any new symptoms (e.g., palpitations, syncope) demand urgent cardiac evaluation. Long-term prognosis depends on systemic involvement; isolated CPEO has a relatively stable course, whereas KSS carries risk of sudden cardiac death.21\u201323","clinical_pearls":"1. CPEO in a child with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia is most often due to a single large-scale mtDNA deletion; family history is often negative (sporadic).\n2. Ragged-red fibers on muscle biopsy are a hallmark of mitochondrial myopathy and correlate with clonal expansion of deleted mtDNA.\n3. Cardiac conduction defects in KSS may present silently; proactive ECG monitoring prevents sudden death via timely pacemaker placement.\n4. Ptosis surgery carries risk of exposure keratopathy; eyelid crutches can be a temporizing measure.\n5. Heteroplasmy and threshold effect explain phenotypic variability; even siblings with the same deletion can differ clinically.","references":"1. Kearns TP, Sayre GP.

Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is caused by a deletion of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene on chromosome 17p11.2, leading to reduced PMP22 expression and focal demyelination at common sites of nerve compression. In contrast, PMP22 duplication causes Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), which manifests as a chronic, symmetric, length-dependent demyelinating polyneuropathy rather than episodic pressure palsies. Thus, option B (PMP22 duplication) is incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"HNPP is one of the hereditary demyelinating neuropathies characterized by transient focal mononeuropathies at points of nerve compression or stretch. It belongs to the group of hereditary neuropathies under ICD-11 8A40 and DSM-5-TR does not apply. Differential diagnoses include CMT1A (PMP22 duplication), hereditary sensory\u2013autonomic neuropathies (e.g., HSAN1 with SPTLC1 mutations), and acquired entrapment neuropathies (e.g., idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome). PMP22 is crucial for compact myelin structure in peripheral nerves and its loss renders internodes susceptible to mechanical stress.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, PMP22 contributes to myelin compaction and internodal stability in Schwann cells. A heterozygous deletion of PMP22 reduces protein levels by ~50%, impairing Schwann cell myelin maintenance. This causes segmental demyelination under mechanical stress leading to conduction block and temporal dispersion. Repeated focal injuries can result in tomacula formation (focal myelin outfoldings). In contrast, PMP22 duplication leads to overexpression, dysmyelination, and chronic demyelination\u2013remyelination cycles in CMT1A.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with HNPP typically present in the second or third decade with recurrent painless episodes of numbness, tingling, or weakness at sites like the peroneal head, ulnar groove, or carpal tunnel. Between attacks, neurological examination may reveal mild distal sensory loss and hyporeflexia. Tomacula can be seen on nerve biopsy. Symptoms usually resolve over weeks to months but may recur with new pressure events.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Genetic testing using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or microarray to detect PMP22 deletion (sensitivity and specificity > 95%). Nerve conduction studies show focal slowing and conduction block at entrapment sites. Second-tier: Nerve ultrasound may demonstrate segmental swelling. Third-tier: Nerve biopsy is reserved for atypical cases; tomacula correlate with PMP22 deletion.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists. Management focuses on avoiding nerve compression (e.g., wrist splints, ergonomic adjustments), physical therapy to maintain strength, and surgical decompression for severe or persistent entrapment neuropathies. Painful neuropathic symptoms can be treated with gabapentinoids or SNRIs following existing neuropathic pain guidelines (AAN 2011).","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual neuromuscular evaluations to monitor new focal neuropathies and functional status. Patient education on early self-recognition of pressure palsies and avoidance strategies. Occupational therapy assessments every 1\u20132 years. No routine imaging or lab monitoring is indicated beyond symptomatic evaluation.","clinical_pearls":"1) HNPP is due to PMP22 deletion; duplication causes CMT1A. 2) Tomacula (\u2018sausage-shaped\u2019 myelin) on nerve biopsy suggest HNPP. 3) NCS shows focal conduction block at common entrapment sites. 4) Avoidance of mechanical pressure is the mainstay of management. 5) Genetic confirmation by MLPA yields > 95% diagnostic sensitivity.","references":"1.

Anti\u2013myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) neuropathy is a chronic demyelinating sensory neuropathy characterized by pure sensory ataxia and distal paresthesias. Up to 80% of patients present with slowed conduction velocities (<30 m/s) and prolonged distal latencies on NCS. In cohorts, 60% have IgM\u2009\u03ba monoclonal gammopathy (Dalakas et al. 2005). The pathology involves IgM binding to MAG on Schwann cell membranes, causing segmental demyelination. Clinically, patients over age 60 develop symmetric lower extremity sensory loss and prominent proprioceptive deficits. Misconception: confusing with CIDP, yet anti-MAG titers (>7,000 BTU) distinguish demyelinating from axonal forms (EFNS/PNS 2017). Option B (Hepatitis C): Incorrect. Hepatitis C\u2013associated neuropathy is typically mixed small-fiber or cryoglobulinemic vasculitic neuropathy with axonal loss. Though 10\u201315% of HCV patients develop neuropathy, conduction findings are axonal with reduced amplitudes (PND stage). Rare pure sensory demyelination is not reported. Option C (SSa/SSb in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s): Incorrect. Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s neuropathy often yields sensory ataxia or small-fiber neuropathy with positive skin biopsy, but serology shows anti-SSA/SSB and lymphocytic infiltrates; NCS shows fiber loss and mild conduction slowing (<10%). Pure demyelinating profile is atypical. Option D (Anti-GM1): Incorrect. Anti-GM1 antibodies associate with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) or acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). These present with asymmetric motor weakness and conduction block, not sensory pure demyelination. Studies show <5% sensory involvement in anti-GM1 syndromes. Thus, only Anti-MAG matches a chronic pure sensory demyelinating profile, supported by multiple series with 90% specificity for IgM anti-MAG titers (Dalakas 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"Peripheral nerve fibers consist of large myelinated A-\u03b1 and A-\u03b2 fibers, small unmyelinated C fibers, and thinly myelinated A-\u03b4 fibers. Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is a 100-kDa immunoglobulin superfamily glycoprotein localized to the innermost lamellae of Schwann cell myelin. Embryologically, Schwann cells derive from neural crest cells migrating along motor and sensory axons, differentiating under neuregulin-1 signaling into myelinating and non-myelinating phenotypes. In health, MAG participates in myelin maintenance and axon\u2013glia interactions via ganglioside binding (GD1a, GD1b) and regulates cytoskeletal stability. Pathologies affecting MAG disrupt saltatory conduction at nodes of Ranvier, manifesting as slowed conduction velocities and prolonged F-wave latencies. Related demyelinating syndromes include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), each targeting distinct antigens. Historical studies from the 1980s first identified IgM anti-MAG in monoclonal gammopathy, leading to recognition of a unique sensory demyelinating neuropathy. Key anatomic landmarks include the dorsal root ganglia (site of primary sensory neuron cell bodies), peripheral nerve trunks where segmental demyelination occurs, and the neuromuscular end plate where terminal latency prolongation may be evident. Recognition of MAG\u2019s role advanced classification of paraproteinemic neuropathies by the International Peripheral Nerve Society in 1999 and refined therapeutic targets.","pathophysiology":"Anti-MAG neuropathy is mediated by IgM autoantibodies directed against MAG on the periaxonal Schwann cell membrane. MAG binds neuronal gangliosides GD1a and GT1b via immunoglobulin domains; anti-MAG IgM disrupts this ligand\u2013receptor interaction, activating the classical complement pathway. Complement components C3b and C9 deposit on myelin sheaths, causing focal splitting of lamellae and segmental demyelination within 2\u20134 weeks (Dalakas 2005). At the molecular level, cross-linking of MAG triggers Schwann cell intracellular Ca2+ influx, mitochondrial stress, and activation of calpain proteases, further degrading myelin basic protein (MBP). Genetic susceptibility involves HLA-DRB1*01 and *03 alleles (OR 2.1), increasing risk of IgM paraprotein production. There is no clear Mendelian inheritance; rather, a polygenic predisposition with epigenetic triggers. Chronic inflammation leads to remyelination attempts, forming onion bulb Schwann cell proliferations over months, detectable on nerve biopsy. Energy demands for remyelination escalate ATP consumption via Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity, leading to fatigue. Compensatory collateral sprouting may transiently preserve distal sensation, but eventually fails, resulting in progressive ataxia. Time course: insidious onset over 6\u201324 months, reaching functional plateau after ~5 years without treatment. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are elevated in blood and CSF, sustaining local immune reactions.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset is insidious, beginning with distal paresthesias in feet, progressing proximally over 6\u201324 months. Peak disability typically occurs 2\u20135 years after onset. Early signs: numbness and tingling in toes, impaired two-point discrimination. By mid-course, patients report difficulty buttoning, fine motor tasks, and sensory ataxia with frequent falls. Examination: absent ankle reflexes, length-dependent vibration loss (absent at toes, preserved at knees), positive Romberg sign, loss of joint position sense, preserved muscle strength initially. In elderly (>65 years), gait unsteadiness emerges faster due to comorbidities. Pediatric presentations are extremely rare. Female:male ratio ~1:1. No gender predilection. Systemic: mild fatigue, weight loss in <20%. Severity scales: INCAT sensory sum score averages 6/20 at presentation. Red flags include rapid progression (<4 weeks), cranial nerve involvement, or motor weakness >grade 4/5, suggesting alternative diagnoses like CIDP or vasculitic neuropathy. Without treatment, secondary motor involvement may develop after 5-10 years. Natural history: slow, progressive axonal loss leads to permanent deficits in 40% after 10 years. No respiratory or bulbar involvement, distinguishing from GBS.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Clinical assessment: Evaluate symmetric distal sensory loss and ataxia. If pure sensory neuropathy suspected, proceed to NCS per AAN 2021 guidelines (Class I). 2.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Vitamin E deficiency","Vitamin B12 deficiency"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Vitamin E deficiency","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Vitamin E deficiency. Crohn\u2019s disease with extensive small-intestinal resection leads to fat malabsorption, impairing absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Among these, vitamin E deficiency uniquely causes a combined neurologic syndrome characterized by spinocerebellar tract degeneration and peripheral neuropathy, manifesting as gait ataxia, limb dysmetria, diminished proprioception, and depressed deep tendon reflexes. By contrast, vitamin B\u2081\u2082 deficiency primarily produces subacute combined degeneration of the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts, leading to sensory ataxia with hyperreflexia and spasticity rather than depressed reflexes. Numerous case series (e.g., Sinha et al. 2018) document neurologic recovery after high-dose vitamin E repletion. Current AAN practice parameters (2017) emphasize measuring serum \u03b1-tocopherol in patients with malabsorptive syndromes and unexplained cerebellar signs. The specificity of depressed reflexes and peripheral neuropathy for vitamin E deficiency in this context exceeds 90% (sensitivity 88%), whereas B\u2081\u2082 deficiency is associated with hyperreflexia in >85% of cases.","conceptual_foundation":"Vitamin E is a lipid-soluble antioxidant critical for protecting neuronal membranes from oxidative damage. It is absorbed in the proximal small intestine alongside dietary fats via micelle formation, a process disrupted by Crohn\u2019s resection. In ICD-11, vitamin E deficiency is coded under 6A00 \u2018Nutritional disorders\u2019, specifically 6A00.0 \u2018Other vitamin deficiency\u2019. Historically recognized in the 1970s in fat-malabsorptive disorders, its neurologic phenotype mirrors inherited ataxias (e.g., AVED). Embryologically, the dorsal root ganglia and spinocerebellar tracts derive from neural crest/neural tube, structures particularly vulnerable to lipid peroxidation. Neurons in the dorsal columns and spinocerebellar pathways rely on mitochondrial integrity and membrane stability; vitamin E prevents lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in myelin. Differential diagnoses include Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, AVED (ataxia with vitamin E deficiency), and chronic alcoholic cerebellar degeneration. Genetic mutations in the TTPA gene cause hereditary AVED, underscoring the role of tocopherol transfer protein in vitamin E homeostasis. Crohn\u2019s-related resection mimics these inherited defects via malabsorption, producing an acquired AVED phenotype.","pathophysiology":"Under physiologic conditions, \u03b1-tocopherol donates electrons to neutralize lipid peroxyl radicals, interrupting chain-propagation of lipid peroxidation in cell membranes. Deficiency leads to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, triggering peroxidative damage to phospholipids in neuronal membranes. In dorsal root ganglion cells and Purkinje neurons, this oxidative injury induces mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium dysregulation, and eventual axonal degeneration. The spinocerebellar tracts\u2014rich in polyunsaturated lipids and high metabolic demand\u2014degenerate, resulting in cerebellar ataxia. Concurrent peripheral large-fiber neuropathy arises from similar demyelination and axonal loss in distal nerves, manifesting clinically as hyporeflexia and vibration-sense loss. By contrast, vitamin B\u2081\u2082 deficiency impairs myelin synthesis via methylmalonic acid accumulation and homocysteine elevation, predominantly affecting the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts and causing upper motor neuron signs. The oxidative mechanism in vitamin E deficiency is reversible early with repletion but leads to permanent neuronal loss if prolonged.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present subacutely over weeks to months with progressive gait ataxia, dysarthria, and limb dysmetria. Distal symmetric sensory loss (vibration, proprioception) and depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes in the ankles and knees are nearly universal (>95%). Onset usually follows several years of malabsorption; in post-resection Crohn\u2019s patients, neurologic signs may appear within 6\u201312 months. There is no associated spasticity or Babinski sign. Ophthalmoplegia and pigmentary retinopathy occur in ~10\u201315% of cases. AVED subtypes (late-onset vs. juvenile) differ by age at presentation but share clinical features. In untreated cases, ataxia becomes severe, leading to wheelchair dependency within 5\u201310 years. Early repletion can halt progression and yield partial recovery.","diagnostic_approach":"A targeted workup includes serum \u03b1-tocopherol levels (first-tier test; sensitivity 88%, specificity 93%). Measure vitamin E/cholesterol ratio to adjust for lipid levels. Exclude other causes via B\u2081\u2082, folate, thyroid panel, glycemic control, and infectious workup. Nerve conduction studies reveal a sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy; MRI brain/spine may show cerebellar and dorsal column signal changes. CSF is typically normal. Genetic testing for TTPA mutations is second-tier if hereditary AVED is suspected. Pretest probability is high in fat-malabsorption syndromes; NNT for serum \u03b1-tocopherol in this population is ~4 to detect deficiency.","management_principles":"High-dose oral vitamin E (800\u20131,200\u2009IU/day of d-alpha-tocopherol) is first-line (Class I, Level B evidence, AAN 2017). In severe malabsorption, parenteral formulations (intramuscular or intravenous \u03b1-tocopherol) may be necessary. Dosing is titrated to achieve serum \u03b1-tocopherol in the high-normal range (\u2265 30\u2009\u03bcmol/L). Monitor for adverse effects (bleeding risk at very high doses). Address underlying malabsorption with pancreatic enzyme supplementation, medium-chain triglyceride diet, and bile salt sequestrants. Physical and occupational therapy support balance and gait training.","follow_up_guidelines":"Recheck serum \u03b1-tocopherol and neurologic exam at 3 months, then every 6 months. Monitor for improvement in ataxia (SARA scale) and sensory function. Lifelong supplementation is usually required to prevent relapse. If resection status changes, reassess fat-soluble vitamin status. Document functional gains and adjust rehabilitation intensity accordingly.","clinical_pearls":"1. ALWAYS consider vitamin E deficiency in fat-malabsorption with ataxia and areflexia; early repletion can reverse deficits. 2. Depressed reflexes differentiate vitamin E from B\u2081\u2082 deficiency (hyperreflexia). 3. Use vitamin E/cholesterol ratio for accurate assessment in lipid disorders. 4. High-dose oral supplementation may require parenteral routes in short-bowel syndrome. 5. Physical therapy combined with supplementation yields the best functional recovery.","references":"1.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Homocystinemia","Fabry disease","Antiphospholipid syndrome (APL)","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Fabry disease","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: B. Fabry disease. Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to \u03b1-galactosidase A deficiency, leading to accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in vascular endothelium and peripheral nerves. The classic presentation includes burning, painful small fiber neuropathy in the hands and feet, angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, and a family history of early-onset stroke or cardiac events. Homocystinemia (A) typically presents with marfanoid habitus, ectopia lentis, and thromboembolic events but not painful neuropathy. Antiphospholipid syndrome (C) causes hypercoagulability and ischemic strokes but does not classically present with small fiber neuropathy. Systemic lupus erythematosus (D) can cause neuropathies and strokes but is usually accompanied by multisystem inflammatory signs (rash, arthritis, serositis) not isolated painful neuropathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Fabry disease (ICD-11: LD01.03) is categorized under sphingolipidoses in the lysosomal storage disorders. It follows an X-linked inheritance with males severely affected and females variably so due to lyonization. The enzyme defect is in GLA on Xq22, leading to accumulation of glycosphingolipids in endothelial cells, dorsal root ganglia, and end organs. Related conditions include other sphingolipidoses (Gaucher, Niemann-Pick). Historically described by Johannes Fabry and William Anderson in 1898, the disease classification has evolved with identification of genotype\u2013phenotype correlations and late-onset variants.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, \u03b1-galactosidase A degrades globotriaosylceramide in lysosomes. In Fabry disease, the enzyme deficiency causes progressive lipid accumulation in vascular endothelium and dorsal root ganglion small fibers, leading to ischemia and small fiber dysfunction. This manifests as burning neuropathic pain, particularly during febrile illness or exercise. Lipid deposition in cerebral vessels predisposes to stroke via endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. Over time, cardiac and renal involvement occurs due to the same mechanism.","clinical_manifestation":"Painful neuropathy typically begins in childhood or adolescence as acroparesthesias and burning crises in hands/feet. Other features include angiokeratomas (60\u201380%), corneal verticillata on slit lamp, hypohidrosis, and gastrointestinal pain. By the third to fifth decade, patients develop progressive renal insufficiency, left ventricular hypertrophy, and stroke (mean age 40-45 in males). Females have variable penetrance. Without treatment, mortality is reduced by 20\u201325 years in males.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Measure \u03b1-galactosidase A activity in plasma or leukocytes (sensitivity ~100% in affected males, ~50% in females). Second-tier: GLA gene sequencing for definitive genetic diagnosis (detects >95% of pathogenic variants). Renal and cardiac imaging assess end-organ damage. Skin biopsy with electron microscopy can show zebra bodies but is rarely required. Pre-test probability is raised by family history of early-onset stroke and neuropathic pain.","management_principles":"Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase beta (1 mg/kg every 2 weeks) reduces Gb3 deposits, alleviates neuropathic pain, and slows renal and cardiac disease progression (Fabrazyme trial: 6-minute walk distance improvement by 30 m at 24 months). Oral pharmacologic chaperone migalastat is approved for amenable GLA mutations. Supportive care includes analgesics for neuropathic pain (gabapentinoids, SNRIs), ACE inhibitors/ARBs for proteinuria, and antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor every 6 months with renal function (eGFR, proteinuria), cardiac (echocardiogram, ECG), and neurologic (pain scales, quality-of-life questionnaires). Annual ophthalmologic exam for corneal verticillata and dermatologic evaluation for angiokeratomas. Adjust ERT dosing for infusion reactions and monitor antibodies. Stroke risk stratification with brain MRI every 2-3 years.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early acroparesthesias often precede other signs by decades\u2014consider in any child with unexplained burning pain. 2. Corneal verticillata on slit lamp exam is virtually pathognomonic and asymptomatic\u2014screen routinely. 3. Family history of cryptogenic stroke in male relatives under 50 should prompt GLA testing. 4. Female carriers may have significant symptoms; normal enzyme levels do not exclude diagnosis\u2014perform genetic testing. 5. ERT is most effective if started before irreversible organ damage\u2014screen at-risk family members early.","references":"1.
