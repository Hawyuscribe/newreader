Which of the following is the recommended first-line treatment?","options":["Acetaminophen","Triptan","Valproic acid","Naproxen"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Acetaminophen","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. Acetaminophen. In pregnancy, acetaminophen is first-line for acute migraine due to a well-established safety profile. Triptans (B) have limited data in the first trimester; valproic acid (C) is teratogenic and contraindicated; NSAIDs such as naproxen (D) may be used in the second trimester but are avoided before 12 weeks and in the third trimester due to fetal risks.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine without aura in pregnancy falls under ICD-11 8A80. Migraine pathophysiology involves trigeminovascular activation and CGRP release. Pregnancy alters hormone levels (elevated estrogen and progesterone) which often improve migraine frequency, but acute attacks still require safe treatment.","pathophysiology":"Migraine pain arises from activation of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and peripheral meningeal nociceptors, leading to release of vasoactive peptides like CGRP, resulting in sterile neurogenic inflammation. Acetaminophen modulates central prostaglandin synthesis and serotonergic descending pathways without affecting uteroplacental blood flow.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute migraine in pregnancy presents with unilateral throbbing headache, photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea. Attacks may last 4\u201372 hours and can occur with or without aura. Pregnancy often decreases attack frequency but can worsen in some women.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical based on ICHD-3 criteria. Neuroimaging is not indicated in typical migraine without red flags. In pregnancy, consider preeclampsia features if headache is new or severe.","management_principles":"First-line: acetaminophen 1 g PO. If inadequate, consider metoclopramide for nausea. Reserved triptan use (sumatriptan) after first trimester if needed. Avoid ergotamines, opioids, NSAIDs (first trimester) and teratogenic agents like valproate.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess headache control and fetal well-being at each prenatal visit. Monitor for development of preeclampsia or hypertension. Adjust therapy based on gestational age and trimester-specific safety.","clinical_pearls":"1. Acetaminophen is the only analgesic with unequivocal safety in all trimesters. 2. Sumatriptin registry data show low risk but prefer after 12 weeks. 3. NSAIDs avoided in first and third trimesters. 4. Valproate is strictly contraindicated. 5. Metoclopramide is safe for nausea in pregnancy.","references":["1. Tepper SJ et al.

She takes acetaminophen twice daily and oral sumatriptan 3 to 4 times per week. A medication-overuse headache (MOH) is suspected. Which of the following associated features would be most supportive of a diagnosis of MOH in this patient?","options":["Absence of neck pain","Absence of rhinorrhea","Constant frontal location","Mild severity","Worsened severity upon awakening"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Mild severity","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Medication-overuse headache (MOH) typically presents as a mild to moderate daily, dull, nonthrobbing headache that lacks the severe intensity of primary headache attacks. The overuse of simple analgesics and triptans leads to chronifying headache symptoms. Absence of autonomic features (rhinorrhea) or neck pain is nonspecific. Constant frontal location can occur but is not required. Worsening on awakening may reflect withdrawal but is less characteristic than low baseline severity that increases with overuse.","conceptual_foundation":"MOH is categorized under ICHD-3 as a secondary headache (8.2). It arises in patients with preexisting primary headache disorders who overuse acute headache medications on \u226510\u201315 days per month for >3 months. Key features include daily or near-daily headache, mild to moderate intensity, and improvement after medication withdrawal.","pathophysiology":"Chronic analgesic overuse leads to upregulation of central pronociceptive pathways, altered serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission, increased expression of calcitonin gene\u2010related peptide, and reduced endogenous opioid receptor sensitivity. This neuroplastic change lowers pain thresholds, resulting in persistent, mild headache.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report daily or near-daily headache, often bilateral and pressing in quality. Intensity is typically mild to moderate, allowing normal activities. There is increased headache frequency over months, with brief relief only after taking the offending medication.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis requires headache on \u226515 days/month in a patient with preexisting headache disorder, regular overuse of acute medications (e.g., simple analgesics \u226515 days/month or triptans \u226510 days/month) for >3 months, and headache worsening during medication periods. No specific laboratory tests; diagnosis is clinical.","management_principles":"Primary management is withdrawal of the overused medication, often with bridging therapy (e.g., naproxen 500 mg BID for 2 weeks) to manage rebound headache. Preventive therapy for the underlying primary headache (e.g., topiramate for migraine) should be initiated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor headache diaries monthly, assess withdrawal symptoms, titrate preventive therapy over 3\u20136 months, and reassess medication use. Long-term follow-up to prevent relapse.","clinical_pearls":"1. MOH headaches are mild/moderate\u2014not severe. 2. Triptan overuse is defined as \u226510 days/month. 3. Withdrawal leads to headache worsening initially. 4. Preventive therapy should begin early. 5. Keep headache diaries to track medication use.","references":"1.

Acetaminophen. For acute moderate migraine without contraindications, simple analgesics like acetaminophen are a reasonable first-line choice. Oral morphine (B) is not recommended due to dependency risk and opioid-induced hyperalgesia; ergotamine (C) has more side effects and contraindications; intravenous valproic acid (D) is used in refractory status migrainosus in hospital settings, not first-line outpatient therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine without aura (ICHD-3 code 1.1) involves trigeminovascular system activation, cortical spreading depression, and brainstem modulation. First\u2010line outpatient acute therapy stratifies treatment by attack severity and disability rather than aura presence, with non-opiate analgesics or triptans for moderate to severe attacks.","pathophysiology":"Migraine ictal events begin with cortical spreading depression triggering trigeminal nerve activation and release of vasoactive peptides (CGRP, substance P), causing vasodilation, plasma protein extravasation, and sterile neurogenic inflammation. Acetaminophen acts centrally to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and enhance pain threshold.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical migraine presents with unilateral, pulsating headache of moderate to severe intensity, aggravated by physical activity, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Duration is 4\u201372 hours. Normal neuro exam and imaging in uncomplicated cases.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical based on ICHD-3 criteria. Neuroimaging reserved for atypical features or red flags. No laboratory tests are indicated.","management_principles":"First-line: acetaminophen or NSAIDs (ibuprofen if no contraindications). If inadequate, stratified approach with triptans or combination analgesics (e.g., aspirin+acetaminophen+caffeine). Avoid opioids and ergot derivatives as first-line agents.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess treatment response after 2\u20134 weeks. If frequent or refractory, consider preventive therapy. Educate on lifestyle triggers and non-pharmacologic measures like biofeedback and relaxation techniques.","clinical_pearls":"1. Use simple analgesics first in mild-to-moderate attacks. 2. Save triptans for moderate-to-severe or non-responders. 3. Avoid opioids due to risk of MOH (medication overuse headache). 4. Ergotamines have limited tolerability and are contraindicated in vascular disease. 5. Early treatment within 1 hour of onset improves outcomes.","references":["1. Silberstein SD, et al.

Valproic acid and lamotrigine are used in chronic migraine or trigeminal neuralgia prophylaxis, but are not diagnostic or first-line for hemicrania continua. Naproxen may provide temporary relief but lacks the consistent, complete response that defines hemicrania continua.","conceptual_foundation":"Hemicrania continua is classified under ICHD-3 code 3.4.2. It is a primary headache disorder characterized by unilateral pain without side-switching, continuous background headache, and exacerbations with autonomic features. Differential diagnoses include chronic migraine, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, and cervicogenic headache; indomethacin responsiveness is required for diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"Although the exact mechanism is unclear, it likely involves activation of the trigeminovascular system and parasympathetic pathways, leading to meningeal inflammation and autonomic features. Indomethacin may exert its effect via cyclooxygenase inhibition, reducing prostaglandin-mediated nociception.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report a strictly unilateral, continuous headache of moderate intensity, with superimposed peaks of severe pain lasting minutes to hours. Exacerbations often include ipsilateral lacrimation, nasal congestion, or ptosis. The disorder predominantly affects middle-aged women, with gradual onset.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical based on ICHD-3 criteria: unilateral continuous headache, exacerbations with autonomic signs, complete response to indomethacin (dose 25\u2013150 mg/day divided). A therapeutic trial of indomethacin confirms the diagnosis. Brain MRI should be normal to exclude secondary causes.","management_principles":"Indomethacin is the treatment of choice. Initiate at 25 mg TID and titrate to response, monitoring for gastrointestinal or renal side effects. If intolerant, alternative NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors may be tried, but lack consistent efficacy. Other prophylactics (e.g., topiramate) are less reliable.","follow_up_guidelines":"After induction of remission, taper indomethacin to the lowest effective dose. Evaluate renal function and GI tolerance every 3\u20136 months. Regular headache diaries help monitor breakthrough attacks and medication overuse.","clinical_pearls":"1. Complete indomethacin response is diagnostic for hemicrania continua. 2. Continuous unilateral headache with autonomic features differentiates it from chronic migraine. 3. Exacerbations last minutes to hours. 4. Indomethacin titration is required to find the minimal effective dose. 5. Monitor for NSAID-related adverse effects.","references":"1.
