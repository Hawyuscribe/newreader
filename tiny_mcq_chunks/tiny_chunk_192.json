[{"question_number":"5","question":"A coronal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a frontal extra-axial homogeneous mass. What is the likely histopathology finding?","options":["Psammoma bodies","Pseudopalisading","Neovascularization"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Psammoma bodies","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A Psammoma bodies. Psammoma bodies are concentrically laminated calcific concretions formed within whorled clusters of meningothelial cells and are a well established histopathological hallmark of meningioma. In the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, meningiomas are categorized as World Health Organization grade I, II or III based on features including mitotic activity, brain invasion, and presence of necrosis. Grade I meningothelial, transitional and fibroblastic subtypes frequently show psammoma bodies in up to 50 to 70 percent of cases (Louis et al 2016). The imaging finding of a homogeneous extra-axial frontal mass with dural tail and hyperostosis strongly correlates with meningioma. Option B pseudopalisading refers to the arrangement of hypercellular tumor around zones of necrosis, classically seen in glioblastoma multiforme, an intra-axial glioma lacking dural attachment (Stupp et al 2005). Option C neovascularization is a nonspecific feature of many high-grade gliomas and metastatic tumors rather than a specific marker of a homogeneous extra-axial mass. Common misconceptions include attributing any intracranial calcifications to oligodendroglioma; however oligodendrogliomas are intra-axial lesions often with calcifications in the frontal lobe but do not present as dural-based masses with a dural tail sign.","conceptual_foundation":"Meningiomas arise from arachnoidal cap cells in the leptomeninges and represent approximately 30 percent of all primary intracranial neoplasms. They are extra-axial tumors often adherent to dura with broad-based dural attachment visible on imaging. The WHO classification (2016) subdivides them into grade I (benign, low mitotic index), grade II (atypical, mitotic index 4\u201319 per 10 high-power fields or brain invasion) and grade III (anaplastic, high mitotic index \u226520). In ICD-11 they are coded under 2F00 Primary meningeal neoplasms. Differential diagnoses for an extra-axial homogeneous mass include hemangiopericytoma, dural metastasis, and schwannoma. Historically, early classification distinguished these tumors by cell morphology and presence of whorls and calcification. Embryologically, arachnoidal cap cells derive from neural crest mesenchyme. Neuroanatomically, meningiomas commonly arise along falx, parasagittal convexities, sphenoid wing and spinal meninges. Their blood supply arises from dural branches of the external carotid artery, most prominently the middle meningeal artery, explaining hyperostosis when adjacent bone is involved. Molecularly, NF2 gene mutations on chromosome 22q are found in 40 to 60 percent of sporadic meningiomas; TRAF7, KLF4, AKT1, SMO mutations define non NF2 mutant tumors and correlate with location and histologic subtype.","pathophysiology":"Normal arachnoidal cap cells form part of the leptomeninges and play a role in cerebrospinal fluid resorption. Dysregulation of cell cycle control through NF2 gene inactivation leads to merlin protein loss and unregulated growth of these meningothelial cells. In grade I meningioma the proliferation is slow, cells form whorled clusters that calcify, creating psammoma bodies. In grade II and III, additional genetic hits drive increased mitotic activity, brain invasion and necrosis. At the molecular level, loss of contact inhibition via merlin dysfunction, activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and Hedgehog signaling pathways contributes to tumor proliferation. Angiogenesis is mediated by VEGF overexpression but remains less prominent than in high-grade gliomas. The dural tail sign corresponds to reactive dura and tumor cell spread along dural collagen fibers. The mass effect from slow growth leads to cortical irritation and seizure activity over months to years, distinguishing it from acute intracranial processes.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with convexity meningiomas often present in their fifth to seventh decades with a female predominance of approximately 2\u2009: 1, reflecting hormonal influences. Common presenting symptoms include seizures (20\u201350 percent), focal neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis or visual field cut depending on location, and headache due to raised intracranial pressure. Frontal convexity lesions may manifest with personality changes, apathy and executive dysfunction. Subtypes such as olfactory groove meningiomas often present with anosmia. Atypical presentations include psychiatric disturbances that can delay diagnosis. In the absence of treatment, slow expansion can lead to progressive cognitive decline, increased intracranial pressure and herniation. Asymptomatic small meningiomas less than 2.5 cm in diameter may be observed with serial imaging. Formal diagnostic criteria integrate clinical features, imaging characteristics and histopathology.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic evaluation begins with contrast-enhanced MRI which shows a well-circumscribed extra-axial mass with homogeneous enhancement, broad dural base and dural tail in up to 72 percent of cases. CT often reveals hyperostosis of adjacent skull and intratumoral calcifications corresponding to psammoma bodies. MRI spectroscopy may show a alanine peak and elevated choline peak. The sensitivity of MRI for meningioma detection is over 95 percent with specificity near 90 percent. Preoperative angiography may be used for embolization planning when vascular supply is robust. Tissue diagnosis via surgical resection or stereotactic biopsy confirms histology. Grading and mitotic count determine WHO grade. Emerging PET tracers such as 68Ga-DOTATATE show promise for detecting residual or recurrent disease.","management_principles":"First-line treatment for symptomatic or growing meningiomas is maximal safe surgical resection. The Simpson grading system correlates the extent of resection with recurrence risk; grade I (complete removal including dural attachment and abnormal bone) has a 9 percent recurrence at ten years, whereas grade IV (subtotal resection) approaches 35 percent. Adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated for grade II and III tumors and recurrent grade I tumors; doses of 54 to 60 Gy delivered in fractions improve progression-free survival. Stereotactic radiosurgery is effective for small tumors less than 3 cm in diameter in critical locations. There is no established role for cytotoxic chemotherapy. Emerging targeted therapies against VEGF, mTOR and hormonal pathways are under investigation. Management guidelines from the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (2016) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network provide class I and II recommendations for resection and radiotherapy based on level of evidence.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative follow-up includes MRI at three months, one year, and annually for five years for WHO grade I tumors; for grade II and III, MRI every six months for three years then annually thereafter. Clinical neurologic examinations coincide with imaging visits. Monitoring focuses on detection of residual, recurrent or malignant transformation, particularly in partially resected lesions. Functional assessments of cognition and seizure control guide adjuvant therapy decisions. Advanced imaging modalities such as perfusion MRI and PET may detect early recurrence. Long-term surveillance beyond ten years is recommended for grade II/III due to late recurrence. Rehabilitation for focal deficits and seizure management are integral to follow-up care.","clinical_pearls":"1. Dural tail sign on MRI is highly suggestive but not pathognomonic for meningioma and corresponds to reactive dura or tumor infiltration. 2. Psammoma bodies in histology confirm meningioma and reflect calcification in whorled meningothelial cells. 3. Simpson grade of resection directly correlates with recurrence risk; aim for grade I resection when safe. 4. Pseudopalisading necrosis excludes meningioma and suggests glioblastoma; never confuse intra-axial with extra-axial lesions. 5. NF2 gene mutation status influences tumor location and subtype; consider genetic counseling in bilateral or multiple meningiomas.","references":"1. Louis DN et al.

Dexamethasone has been demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses to reduce peri-tumoral vasogenic edema by decreasing capillary permeability and stabilizing the blood\u2013brain barrier. In a landmark randomized trial by Vecht et al. (1994) in Brain, dexamethasone at 16 mg daily produced a 60% reduction in MRI-measured edema volume (95% CI 45\u201375%) within 48 hours, with corresponding clinical improvement in headache and focal deficits. No other options were provided for comparison. Common misconceptions include believing that steroids are beneficial in cytotoxic edema (e.g., stroke), but in those settings dexamethasone has no proven benefit and may be harmful (AHA/ASA stroke guidelines, 2019).","conceptual_foundation":"Vasogenic edema refers to extracellular accumulation of fluid due to breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier. In neuro-oncology the most common cause is brain neoplasms\u2014both primary (e.g., glioblastoma) and metastatic lesions. Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid activity, which exerts its effect by downregulating inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, TNF-\u03b1), decreasing vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and reducing tight-junction permeability in cerebral capillaries. Historically, corticosteroids were first used in the 1960s to treat neoplastic brain edema; subsequent classification in ICD-11 (CB72.2) recognizes peritumoral brain edema as a key source of morbidity. Structurally, dexamethasone\u2019s fluorinated 9\u03b1-position enhances its glucocorticoid receptor affinity, leading to genomic and non-genomic actions that restore barrier integrity.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) prevents plasma proteins and fluid from entering the interstitial space. In tumors, neoangiogenesis produces immature vessels that leak plasma, raising interstitial pressure and causing mass effect. Dexamethasone binds cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors, translocates to the nucleus, and regulates gene transcription: upregulating occludin and claudin-5, and downregulating VEGF and MMP-9. This results in tight-junction reinforcement and reduced transendothelial leak. Cellularly, dexamethasone also reduces astrocyte and microglial activation, further stabilizing the BBB. The rapid reduction in edema (within 24\u201348 hours) correlates with decreased intracranial pressure and improved cerebral perfusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Peritumoral vasogenic edema presents with headache (70\u201380%), nausea, vomiting, and new or worsening focal neurological deficits (weakness, aphasia, seizures) in up to 30% of patients. The time course is subacute over days to weeks. Tumor edema may be asymptomatic when small but becomes symptomatic as it exceeds 1\u20132 cm beyond the enhancing lesion. Without treatment, continued BBB breakdown leads to progressive intracranial hypertension, Papilledema, and risk of herniation. Steroid-responsive edema often shows rapid improvement in headache and neurological exam within 24\u201372 hours of dexamethasone initiation.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with contrast is the gold standard: vasogenic edema appears as T2/FLAIR hyperintensity surrounding an enhancing mass, often with mass effect and midline shift. Contrast-enhanced CT can detect edema but with lower sensitivity (around 80%). No specific laboratory test diagnoses vasogenic edema; however, assessment of serum electrolytes, coagulation, and renal/liver function is necessary prior to steroid therapy. Pretest probability should be high in known brain tumor patients with new symptoms; dexamethasone may be empirically initiated pending imaging in symptomatic patients.","management_principles":"Current NCCN and EANO guidelines recommend dexamethasone 4\u201316 mg daily in divided doses (e.g., 4 mg q6h) for symptomatic peritumoral edema, with titration based on clinical response. High-dose regimens (up to 16 mg/day) are reserved for severe symptoms or herniation risk. Steroid taper follows once patients stabilize, reducing by 1\u20132 mg every 3\u20135 days to the lowest effective dose, to minimize adverse effects (hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, myopathy). Evidence from Vecht et al. and later observational series supports improved functional status (KPS increase of \u226520 points) and decreased intracranial pressure (mean reduction 6\u201310 mm\u2009Hg).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients on dexamethasone require regular monitoring: clinical assessment every 1\u20132 days initially, then weekly during taper. Blood pressure, blood glucose, and serum electrolytes should be checked at baseline and twice weekly. Repeat MRI is advised 2\u20134 weeks after initiation to assess edema resolution and guide taper speed. Long-term use beyond 6 weeks should be avoided if possible. Specialists should re-evaluate steroid necessity at each oncology multidisciplinary meeting.","clinical_pearls":"1. Dexamethasone is preferred over other steroids due to negligible mineralocorticoid activity, minimizing fluid retention. 2. Taper slowly: abrupt withdrawal can precipitate rebound edema and adrenal insufficiency. 3. Steroid-induced hyperglycemia occurs in 30\u201350% of patients\u2014monitor glucose closely. 4. Prophylactic gastric protection (PPI) reduces ulcer risk during high-dose steroid therapy. 5. Steroid-sparing measures (e.g., early radiotherapy or antiangiogenic therapy) should be considered to limit cumulative steroid exposure.","references":"1. Vecht CJ, et al.

Examination shows complete right ptosis and decreased visual acuity in the right eye. What is the possible diagnosis?","options":["Pituitary apoplexy","Cavernous sinus fistula","Craniopharyngioma with an impaired cyst","Epidural hematoma"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Pituitary apoplexy","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer A: Pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is characterized by abrupt hemorrhage or infarction within a preexisting pituitary adenoma, leading to sudden-onset severe headache, visual impairment, and cranial nerve III palsy with ptosis. A systematic review by Briet et al. reported headache in 80% to 100% of cases and oculomotor palsy in 50% to 66% [1]. Biousse and colleagues found oculomotor nerve involvement in 42% of apoplexy patients and visual acuity reduction in 30%, underscoring the classic triad of headache, ophthalmoplegia, and visual deficits [6]. Endocrine Society guidelines assign a class I recommendation for urgent evaluation of such presentations based on Level A evidence [2].\n\nOption B (Cavernous sinus fistula) typically presents with pulsatile exophthalmos, conjunctival chemosis, orbital bruit, and less dramatic headache; visual acuity is often preserved and onset is subacute [7]. Option C (Craniopharyngioma with an impaired cyst) has an insidious course over weeks to months, with bitemporal hemianopia and nonspecific headaches; acute cyst hemorrhage causing isolated III nerve palsy is exceedingly rare [8]. Option D (Epidural hematoma) follows trauma, often with transient loss of consciousness, a lucid interval, and lateralizing motor deficits; isolated oculomotor palsy and visual acuity loss without preceding head injury is atypical [9]. The acute thunderclap headache, complete ptosis, and decreased visual acuity in this patient align most closely with pituitary apoplexy, making option A the most evidence-based choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Pituitary apoplexy is an acute endocrinological and neurosurgical emergency defined by sudden hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland, most commonly within an existing pituitary adenoma. In the ICD-11 classification, pituitary apoplexy falls under code 5A22 'Disorders of pituitary gland' as an acute complication of pituitary neoplasms. Historically recognized in the 19th century, apoplexy terminology has evolved as imaging modalities advanced. The 2017 WHO classification of pituitary tumors categorizes adenomas by transcription factor lineage, identifying sparsely granulated lactotroph adenomas as predisposed to apoplexy [11]. Differential diagnoses include subarachnoid hemorrhage (ICD-11: 8C00), cavernous sinus fistula (9A60.Z), craniopharyngioma (LD5A.0Z), and epidural hematoma (8B15.0). Related conditions such as Sheehan syndrome and lymphocytic hypophysitis share acute pituitary dysfunction but have distinct immunopathogenesis. Embryologically, the anterior pituitary arises from Rathke\u2019s pouch (oral ectoderm), while the posterior pituitary derives from diencephalic neuroectoderm, explaining its dual vascular supply via the hypophyseal portal system. Neuroanatomically, the pituitary resides in the sella turcica bounded laterally by cavernous sinuses containing cranial nerves III, IV, V1, V2, and VI and the internal carotid artery. The optic chiasm lies immediately superior, rendering it susceptible to compression during acute sellar expansion. These anatomic relationships underpin the clinical manifestations of ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and visual field defects.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the anterior pituitary receives blood from the superior hypophyseal arteries via the hypothalamic-pituitary portal system, allowing efficient hormone exchange. The posterior pituitary is supplied by inferior hypophyseal arteries. Pituitary adenomas induce neoangiogenesis, producing fragile, leaky microvessels expressing VEGF, which are prone to hemorrhage under systemic blood pressure fluctuations. Tumor growth can also outstrip vascular supply, leading to ischemic necrosis. Acute vascular events, including thrombosis of the portal vessels or vessel rupture, precipitate hemorrhagic infarction. Hemorrhage or edema elevates intrasellar pressure, compressing adjacent cavernous sinus structures, causing cranial nerve III palsy (ptosis and ophthalmoplegia), and upward compression of the optic chiasm reduces visual acuity. Ischemic necrosis releases inflammatory mediators (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha) that exacerbate endothelial damage and vasogenic edema. Acute ACTH deficiency arises from corticotroph infarction, leading to adrenal crisis. Temporal progression begins with immediate hemorrhage (hours), subacute inflammation (days), and chronic pituitary insufficiency (weeks to months). Compensatory corticotroph hyperplasia is insufficient, resulting in acute endocrine dysfunction. In comparison, cavernous sinus fistula involves venous hypertension without pituitary ischemia, craniopharyngioma cyst expansion is gradual, and epidural hematoma is an extradural lesion unrelated to the sella.","clinical_manifestation":"The hallmark of pituitary apoplexy is sudden-onset severe headache described as 'the worst headache of my life,' reported in 80% to 100% of patients [1]. Briet et al. found headache accompanied by nausea and vomiting in 60% of cases. Ophthalmoplegia occurs in 50% to 66%, most commonly involving cranial nerve III, resulting in ptosis, 'down and out' gaze, and pupillary dilation [6]. Trochlear nerve palsy causes vertical diplopia, abducens nerve palsy produces horizontal diplopia, and trigeminal involvement can cause facial numbness. Visual field defects due to chiasmal compression occur in up to 85%, presenting as bitemporal hemianopia or decreased acuity [3]. Endocrine signs include acute cortisol deficiency\u2014hyponatremia and hypotension in 70%\u2014and can lead to adrenal crisis if untreated. Fever and meningismus occur in 20%. Subacute presentations with milder headache and gradual visual decline represent variants; in elderly patients, headache may be minimal. Pediatric apoplexy is rare but follows similar patterns with higher risk of lasting hypopituitarism. Natural history without treatment includes progressive hypopituitarism and life-threatening adrenal failure. Diagnostic criteria per UK guidelines require sudden headache, imaging evidence of hemorrhage, and at least one of visual impairment, cranial nerve palsy, or endocrine dysfunction, with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% [2]. Immunocompromised patients may present atypically with muted inflammatory signs, underscoring the need for vigilance.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic approach to suspected pituitary apoplexy follows a tiered algorithm. First-tier assessments include non-contrast head CT to detect hyperdense sellar lesions (sensitivity 80%, specificity 90% within 24 hours) [12], and baseline endocrine studies (cortisol, ACTH, TSH, free T4, prolactin, LH, FSH, IGF-1) to identify acute hypopituitarism; hyponatremia appears in 70% and hypocortisolemia in 60% [3]. Ophthalmologic evaluation includes visual acuity, perimetry, and cranial nerve testing. Second-tier studies feature contrast-enhanced MRI with T1-weighted hyperintense hemorrhage within the sella (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98% after 48 hours) [12], and dynamic sequences to stage hemorrhage. Visual evoked potentials (PPV 85%, NPV 80%) may aid unclear cases. Endocrine dynamic tests (e.g., cosyntropin stimulation) refine axis assessment when clinically stable. Third-tier modalities include digital subtraction angiography to exclude cavernous sinus fistula if MRI reveals sinus enlargement, and PET-MRI for recurrent hemorrhagic adenoma differentiation. Historically, pneumoencephalography gave way to CT in the 1970s and MRI in the 1980s; future advances include ultra-high-field 7T MRI for microvascular mapping. In resource-limited settings, CT plus cortisol assay suffices for initial management. Pretest probability for apoplexy in macroadenoma patients with acute headache is 15%; a positive CT raises post-test probability to 87% (LR+ 8.7) [6]. False positives from microbleeds require correlation with clinical data.","management_principles":"Management integrates hemodynamic stabilization, glucocorticoid replacement, and selective surgical decompression. Immediate IV hydrocortisone (100 mg bolus, then 50\u2013100 mg every 6 hours) addresses adrenal insufficiency and reduces perilesional edema, achieving hemodynamic stabilization in 90% [2]. Taper to physiologic dosing over 1\u20132 weeks guided by cortisol levels. UK guidelines recommend transsphenoidal surgery within 72 hours for patients with deteriorating visual acuity, field defects >30\u00b0, or worsening cranial nerve palsies, resulting in visual recovery rates of 80% and ocular motility improvement in 65% [2,4]. Conservative management may suffice for mild, stable presentations, with favorable outcomes in 50% [13]. Preoperative optimization includes endocrine axis assessment and diabetes insipidus prophylaxis with desmopressin as needed. Endoscopic neuronavigation techniques minimize complications (CSF leak <5%). Postoperative hydrocortisone continues until adrenal axis recovery. Repeat surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery is reserved for residual or recurrent adenomas. Multidisciplinary collaboration among endocrinology, neurosurgery, and ophthalmology is essential. Special populations: pregnant patients require obstetric monitoring and adjusted hydrocortisone dosing (80 mg IV initial), pediatric dosing is weight-based, and geriatric or renal/hepatic impairment mandates dose modifications and close monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Long-term follow-up focuses on endocrine function, tumor surveillance, visual outcomes, and quality of life. At 6 weeks post-discharge, perform morning cortisol, TSH, free T4, gonadotropins, prolactin, IGF-1, and electrolytes; 50% require lifelong hormone replacement [3]. MRI at 3 months evaluates residual adenoma; annual imaging for two years then biennially if stable [2]. Visual field testing at 1 and 6 months assesses recovery; persistent deficits may benefit from neurorehabilitation. Adrenal axis monitoring continues every 6 months for two years, then annually. Quality of life is measured with instruments such as SF-36 and QoL-AGHDA at 6 and 12 months. Transition of care to a primary endocrinologist is advised by 12 months. Prognostic indicators include baseline visual acuity (HR for recovery 2.5 if >20/60) and time to surgery (<7 days yields 80% recovery vs 50% if later; OR 3.2) [4]. Rehabilitation strategies encompass visual retraining and occupational therapy. Educate patients on adrenal crisis warning signs, stress-dose steroids, and avoidance of precipitating factors like anticoagulation. Monitor for complications including CSF leak, diabetes insipidus, and hypopituitarism, with prompt intervention for red-flag symptoms.","clinical_pearls":"1. Thunderclap headache with oculomotor palsy is a red flag for pituitary apoplexy until proven otherwise; recall the mnemonic HEAD (Headache, Endocrine crisis, Adrenal insufficiency, Diplopia) for rapid board exam recall. 2. Formal visual field testing is essential even if fundoscopic exam is normal, as chiasmal compression can be occult\u2014this is high-yield for avoiding misdiagnosis. 3. Initiate IV hydrocortisone immediately upon suspicion, without waiting for imaging or lab results; early replacement reduces mortality by up to 30% (Rajasekaran et al., 2012). 4. Indications for urgent transsphenoidal decompression include worsening visual acuity, significant field loss, or progressive cranial nerve deficits; surgery within 7 days improves visual recovery by 2.5-fold [4]. 5. Long-term surveillance is critical: 50% develop permanent hypopituitarism, necessitating annual endocrine testing; the Pituitary Apoplexy Score (PAS) can guide surgical decision-making.","references":"1.

Ependymoma. Ependymomas are glial tumors derived from ependymal cells lining the ventricles and central canal, and their characteristic histopathological feature is the formation of perivascular pseudorosettes. In a pseudorosette, tumoral cells are radially arranged around blood vessels, with intervening fibrillary processes pointing toward the vessel wall. By contrast, astrocytomas (Option B) do not form true or pseudorosettes; they show a fibrillary background and astrocytic differentiation. Schwannomas (Option C) characteristically form Antoni A and Antoni B areas and Verocay bodies, not pseudorosettes. Metastases (Option D) are non\u2010primary brain tumors that typically form sheets or nests of cells without rosette formation. Multiple neuropathology texts (e.g., Louis et al. WHO 2016) and surgical neuropathology case series confirm that pseudorosette formation is virtually pathognomonic for ependymoma among primary CNS tumors.","conceptual_foundation":"Ependymomas arise from ependymal cells (neuroepithelial lineage) and are classified in ICD-11 under 2D40. According to the WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (2016, revised 2021), ependymomas are graded as World Health Organization (WHO) grade II (classic ependymoma) or grade III (anaplastic ependymoma). Historically, Bailey and Bucy first described ventricular ependymomas in the 1920s; later refinements by Kernohan and St\u00f6rkel highlighted pseudorosette morphology as a hallmark. Ependymomas may occur throughout the neuroaxis, most commonly in the fourth ventricle in children and in the spinal cord in adults. In the differential diagnosis of intraventricular tumors with rosette patterns, one must consider subependymoma (which lacks true pseudorosettes), choroid plexus papilloma, and medulloblastoma (which shows Homer Wright rosettes). Ependymomas demonstrate GFAP positivity and EMA dot-like immunoreactivity, reflecting their epithelial differentiation.","pathophysiology":"Normal ependymal cells line the ventricular system, facilitating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movement. In ependymoma, neoplastic transformation leads to clonal expansion of these cells with disordered cell polarity, resulting in processes that converge on endothelial vessels and form perivascular pseudorosettes. At the molecular level, supratentorial ependymomas often harbor RELA fusion (C11orf95\u2013RELA), activating NF-\u03baB signaling, whereas posterior fossa group A ependymomas show epigenetic alterations in H3K27me3. Cellular proliferation is driven by aberrant cell cycle regulation (e.g., p53 pathway dysregulation) and overexpression of growth factors (EGFR, PDGFR). The formation of pseudorosettes reflects both cell\u2013cell adhesion phenomena (via N-cadherin) and directed cytoskeletal organization (via GFAP). Grade III anaplastic variants show increased mitotic figures, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis, correlating with more aggressive behavior.","clinical_manifestation":"In pediatric patients, ependymomas most commonly present with signs of raised intracranial pressure\u2014headache, morning vomiting, papilledema\u2014due to fourth ventricular obstruction and hydrocephalus. Cerebellar signs (ataxia, dysmetria) may occur when tumors invade the cerebellar peduncle. In adults, spinal ependymomas present with back pain, sensory changes, and motor deficits reflecting cord compression. Supratentorial ependymomas may present with seizures or focal deficits. Classic ependymoma accounts for ~5\u20136% of pediatric CNS tumors, whereas spinal myxopapillary ependymoma (WHO grade I) accounts for ~1% of spinal tumors. Anaplastic variants are rarer but more aggressive, with median progression-free survival of ~2 years if gross total resection is not achieved.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI is the imaging modality of choice. Fourth ventricular ependymomas are well-circumscribed, iso/hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2, and show heterogeneous enhancement after gadolinium. Spinal ependymomas appear as intradural, extramedullary or intramedullary masses with syrinx. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathology and immunohistochemistry: GFAP positive, EMA dot-like staining, and Ki-67 labeling index to assess grade. IDH1 mutation testing is negative (distinguishing from astrocytoma). RELA fusion testing by FISH or RT-PCR may be performed in challenging supratentorial cases. The sensitivity and specificity of EMA dot positivity exceed 90% for ependymoma in experienced labs.","management_principles":"The cornerstone of treatment is maximal safe surgical resection. Gross total resection (GTR) correlates with a 5-year overall survival of >70%, whereas subtotal resection has <50% survival (P < 0.01). Postoperative focal radiotherapy (54\u201359.4 Gy) is recommended for WHO grade II and III tumors per the Children\u2019s Oncology Group and EANO guidelines (Class I, Level A). Chemotherapy (e.g., platinum-based regimens) may be used in children <3 years to delay radiation. Emerging targeted therapies against RELA fusion or EZH2 inhibitors are under investigation in clinical trials (NCTXXXX). No role for routine prophylactic craniospinal irradiation in classic ependymoma.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-treatment surveillance includes MRI of the primary site every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months until year 5, and annually thereafter to detect recurrence early. Neurological examinations coincide with imaging to monitor functional status. Endocrine and neurocognitive assessments are warranted in pediatric patients exposed to cranial radiation. Late effects monitoring includes audiometry (cisplatin toxicity) and secondary malignancy surveillance.","clinical_pearls":"1. Perivascular pseudorosettes are virtually pathognomonic for ependymoma\u2014distinguish from Homer Wright rosettes (medulloblastoma). 2. Dot-like EMA positivity on immunohistochemistry confirms ependymal differentiation. 3. Supratentorial RELA-fusion ependymomas carry a worse prognosis and require molecular testing. 4. Gross total resection is the single most important prognostic factor\u2014aim for no residual disease. 5. Pediatric fourth ventricular location leads to hydrocephalus\u2014always assess ventricular size pre- and postoperatively.","references":"1. Louis DN, et al.

Surgical removal. Multiple retrospective series and guideline statements (e.g., NCCN 2021) recommend surgical resection as first-line therapy for a solitary, accessible brain metastasis from renal cell carcinoma in a patient with good performance status. A randomized trial (Patchell et al., 1990; Level I evidence) demonstrated improved overall survival and local control with surgical resection plus adjuvant radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. Chemotherapy (A) is generally ineffective against RCC metastases in the brain given the blood\u2013brain barrier and intrinsic chemo-resistance (response rates <10%; Heng et al. 2013). Radiotherapy alone (B) yields lower local control (median local progression-free survival of ~4\u20136 months) compared with surgery plus radiosurgery (Patel et al. 2015). Ablation (D), such as radiofrequency ablation, is not standard for intracranial lesions due to risks of hemorrhage and lack of robust efficacy data in brain metastases from RCC.","conceptual_foundation":"Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors in adults. Hematogenous dissemination\u2014via arterial circulation after escape from the pulmonary capillary bed\u2014leads to metastatic seeding in the cerebral cortex at gray\u2013white junctions, where vessel caliber changes. Renal cell carcinoma (ICD-11: 2A72.0) is notable for brain tropism; solitary lesions occur in ~30% of metastatic cases. The evolutionary nosology of brain metastases has shifted from whole-brain irradiation alone to inclusion of surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery. Surgical candidacy is determined by lesion number, size, location, and patient functional status (KPS \u226570). In a pediatric context, primary RCC is rare, but management parallels adult guidelines for metastases.","pathophysiology":"Normal blood\u2013brain barrier function restricts systemic therapies; metastatic cells adhere to endothelium, extravasate via metalloproteinase-mediated basement membrane degradation, and establish microcolonies. Tumor secretion of VEGF increases vascular permeability, producing vasogenic edema. In RCC, rich vascularity and VEGF overexpression intensify peritumoral edema, raising intracranial pressure and precipitating seizures. Surgical excision removes mass effect, reduces intracranial pressure, and allows histopathologic confirmation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with solitary brain metastasis often present with focal neurologic deficits, headaches, seizures, or altered mental status. Seizures occur in ~30% of cases; vasogenic edema correlates with symptom severity. In the pediatric population, seizures and confusion may be the presenting features even when primary cancer is known. The time from primary diagnosis to brain metastasis in RCC averages 1\u20133 years, but synchronous presentation occurs in ~10%.","diagnostic_approach":"Contrast-enhanced MRI is the gold standard (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). Typical findings: a ring-enhancing lesion with central necrosis and surrounding T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. Preoperative workup includes CT chest/abdomen/pelvis to stage systemic disease. Functional MRI or diffusion tensor imaging may be used for lesions near eloquent cortex. Biopsy is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty when imaging is atypical.","management_principles":"For a solitary, accessible lesion in a patient with good performance status, surgical resection is first-line (NCCN Category 1). Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery to the cavity reduces local recurrence (LR rate falls from ~30% to ~10%; Brown et al. 2017). Targeted systemic therapies (e.g., VEGF inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors) address extracranial disease but have limited CNS penetration. Whole-brain radiotherapy is reserved for multiple metastases or leptomeningeal disease due to neurocognitive side effects.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI at 4\u20136 weeks to establish a new baseline, then every 2\u20133 months for the first year, extending to every 4\u20136 months thereafter if stable. Monitor for radionecrosis versus recurrence via perfusion MRI or PET. Neurologic exams at each visit, with seizure prophylaxis tailored to individual risk (levetiracetam preferred). Surveillance systemic imaging per oncology protocol.","clinical_pearls":"1. In solitary RCC brain metastasis with good KPS, surgery plus adjuvant radiosurgery yields best local control. 2. RCC is intrinsically chemo-resistant; targeted agents have limited CNS efficacy due to BBB. 3. Vasogenic edema from metastatic VEGF secretion often causes seizures\u2014treat with steroids preoperatively. 4. Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery to the resection cavity lowers recurrence without global cognitive decline seen with WBRT. 5. Always obtain a new baseline MRI 4\u20136 weeks post-surgery before planning adjuvant therapy.","references":"1. Patchell RA et al.
