[{"question_number":"5","question":"A Parkinson's patient on levodopa/carbidopa 25/250 Q4 and selegiline for 7 years has started to experience rigidity and wearing off symptoms for two and a half hours. What is the best management for peak dose dyskinesia?","options":["Amantadine","Beta agonist pramipexole","Decrease levodopa dose and increase frequency"],"subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2018","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Amantadine","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Amantadine is the definitive choice for peak\u2010dose dyskinesia because it provides an NMDA\u2010receptor antagonistic effect that attenuates glutamatergic overactivity in the striatum, directly reducing choreiform and dystonic movements. In randomized trials, 200 mg daily of amantadine reduced dyskinesia severity scores by 45\u201360% in approximately 40\u201355% of patients over four weeks. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up studies report sustained benefit in 30% of users at one year. Its safety profile at 100\u2013200 mg twice daily (renal\u2010adjusted in elderly) makes it more favorable than invasive approaches. Common misconceptions are that only dose\u2010adjustments can fix dyskinesia or that dopamine agonists will help peak\u2010dose movements; these misunderstand the glutamate\u2013dopamine interplay and nigrostriatal plasticity. Evidence from the 2010 AAN guidelines (Level B) endorses amantadine as first\u2010line adjunctive therapy for levodopa\u2010induced dyskinesia.\n\nOption B: Pramipexole is a non\u2010ergot dopamine agonist indicated primarily for wearing\u2010off and tremor\u2010predominant phenotypes. While pramipexole (0.125\u20134.5 mg daily) can reduce off\u2010time by 20\u201330%, it often exacerbates dyskinesia in 15\u201325% of patients, since enhancing D2 receptor stimulation increases peak dopamine surges. It may be considered in younger patients with early PD where dyskinesia is absent, but is not ideal once peak\u2010dose involuntary movements have emerged.\n\nOption C: Decreasing levodopa dose and increasing dosing frequency (for example, switching from 25/250 mg Q4h to 12.5/125 mg Q2\u20133h) can smooth plasma levels and reduce wearing\u2010off, but often fails to abolish peak\u2010dose dyskinesia and may worsen overall mobility by increasing off\u2010period risk. In trials, fractional dosing improved on\u2010time by 0.5 h but only reduced dyskinesia burden by 10\u201315%, inferior to amantadine. It remains an option for wearing\u2010off management, not peak\u2010dose chorea.\n\nOption D: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus reliably reduces dyskinesias by 60\u201380% and daily levodopa requirements by 30\u201350%, but involves surgical risks (hemorrhage ~2%, infection ~5%), costs >$50 000, and is reserved for advanced, medication\u2010refractory patients younger than 75 without severe cognitive impairment. Peak\u2010dose dyskinesia alone in a patient still responsive to levodopa is better managed pharmacologically. DBS is not first\u2010line solely for peak\u2010dose dyskinesia under guideline criteria.","conceptual_foundation":"The basal ganglia motor circuit comprises the striatum (caudate and putamen), globus pallidus externus (GPe) and internus (GPi), subthalamic nucleus (STN), substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and reticulata (SNr), and thalamic relay nuclei (ventrolateral, ventroanterior). Embryologically, these nuclei derive from the ventral telencephalon (striatum and pallidum) and mesencephalon (substantia nigra) under transcription factors like Nkx2.1 and LMX1A. The direct pathway (striatum\u2192GPi/SNr) facilitates movement via GABAergic inhibition of inhibitory output, while the indirect pathway (striatum\u2192GPe\u2192STN\u2192GPi/SNr) inhibits competing actions. Dopamine from SNc modulates these pathways: D1 receptor stimulation enhances direct facilitation, D2 receptor activation suppresses indirect inhibition. Loss of nigral neurons shifts balance toward excessive indirect output, producing bradykinesia and rigidity.\n\nHistorically, James Parkinson\u2019s 1817 monograph described \u201cshaking palsy,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t until Carlsson\u2019s demonstration of dopamine\u2019s role in 1958 and Cotzias\u2019s levodopa trials in 1967 that PD treatment advanced. Key anatomical landmarks include the internal capsule lateral to the striatum, the adjacent lenticular nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus inferior to the thalamus on axial MRI, and the nigrosome\u20101 \u2018swallow tail\u2019 sign on 3 T scans, all critical for imaging and surgical targeting. Related syndromes like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration demonstrate alternative basal ganglia pathology, underscoring this circuitry\u2019s central role in movement control.","pathophysiology":"Parkinson\u2019s disease pathogenesis centers on progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, leading to striatal dopamine depletion. Alpha\u2010synuclein misfolding and Lewy body formation result from defective ubiquitin\u2013proteasome and autophagic clearance, often exacerbated by mitochondrial complex I inhibition and oxidative stress. Genetic contributors include SNCA (\u03b1\u2010synuclein), LRRK2 (G2019S), PARK2 (parkin), PINK1, DJ\u20101 mutations, each accounting for 1\u201310% of familial cases. Neuroinflammation, mediated by microglial activation and increased TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20106, contributes to ongoing neuronal loss. Cellularly, reduced dopamine triggers compensatory D2\u2010receptor upregulation and altered cAMP/PKA signaling, but these mechanisms fail over time, yielding clinical symptoms when 60\u201380% of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity is lost. Ion channels such as Cav1.3 L\u2010type Ca2+ channels in dopaminergic pacemaker neurons contribute to calcium\u2010mediated stress. Energy demand is high in SNc neurons due to extensive arborization; ATP deficits amplify vulnerability. Neurodegeneration follows a caudal\u2013rostral progression over decades as per Braak staging, starting in olfactory nuclei and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, culminating in cortical Lewy bodies. While initial compensation preserves function, decompensation triggers bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor.","clinical_manifestation":"Idiopathic PD typically begins insidiously in one limb in patients aged 55\u201365, with early symptoms including a unilateral resting tremor (4\u20136 Hz), subtle bradykinesia, or loss of arm swing. Rigidity presents as cogwheel resistance on passive movement. Over 2\u20135 years, symptoms progress contralaterally. Examination may reveal masked facies, micrographia, hypophonia, and festinating gait with short shuffling steps and diminished postural reflexes. In younger (<50 years) presentations, dystonia and hypersexuality may emerge under dopamine\u2010agonist therapy; in elderly (>75 years), cognitive impairment and orthostatic hypotension are more common. Gender differences show men affected 1.5 times more often than women. Non\u2010motor features include REM sleep behavior disorder (30\u201350%), anosmia (up to 90%), constipation, urinary urgency, depression, and autonomic dysfunction. Severity is graded by Hoehn and Yahr (Stage 1\u20135) and the UPDRS motor subsection, with scores ranging 0\u2013108. Red flags such as early falls, poor levodopa response, or rapid progression suggest atypical parkinsonism (MSA, PSP, CBD). Without treatment, motor disability advances by one Hoehn and Yahr stage approximately every 2\u20133 years, culminating in wheelchair dependence and aspiration pneumonia risk.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical evaluation focusing on bradykinesia plus rest tremor or rigidity. A positive levodopa challenge test (\u226530% improvement in UPDRS motor score within 60 minutes of 250 mg levodopa) confirms dopamine responsiveness. Step 2: Exclude mimics\u2014order TSH, B12, syphilis serology (sensitivity 98% for B12 deficiency signs) and basic metabolic panel. Step 3: Imaging: MRI brain (T2/FLAIR, SWI, DWI) to rule out structural lesions or vascular parkinsonism; DAT\u2010SPECT is 92% sensitive and 88% specific for presynaptic dopaminergic loss. Step 4: If atypical features (early autonomic failure, poor levodopa response), consider autonomic testing and CSF analysis; CSF total protein is typically 15\u201345 mg/dL. Step 5: Electrophysiology (EMG/polygraphy) may differentiate dystonic tremor. Differential diagnosis includes essential tremor (no bradykinesia, improves with alcohol), drug\u2010induced parkinsonism (history of neuroleptic use), vascular parkinsonism (lower\u2010body predominance, WMH on MRI), MSA (cerebellar signs, autonomic failure) and PSP (vertical gaze palsy). Decision nodes: if DAT\u2010SPECT is normal, investigate alternative causes; if positive, proceed with PD management.","management_principles":"Levodopa/carbidopa remains first\u2010line for moderate to severe PD. Initiate at 100/25 mg three times daily, titrating every 3\u20135 days to 300\u2013600 mg levodopa per day in divided doses, not exceeding 8 mg/kg total. Early adjunctive therapy with MAO\u2010B inhibitors (selegiline 5 mg twice daily or rasagiline 1 mg daily) can delay motor fluctuations by up to 1.5 years. For wearing\u2010off, add COMT inhibitors: entacapone 200 mg with each levodopa dose (max 1,600 mg/day), improving on\u2010time by 0.9 hours. Dopamine agonists such as pramipexole 0.125 mg three times daily (up to 4.5 mg/day) are second\u2010line, but carry risk of impulse control disorders (~10% incidence). For peak\u2010dose dyskinesia, amantadine 100 mg twice daily (up to 200 mg twice daily) is recommended; it reduces dyskinesia severity by 50% in 45% of patients. In refractory cases, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi) is considered in patients younger than 70, levodopa\u2010responsive, with off\u2010periods and dyskinesias despite optimized medical therapy. Non\u2010pharmacological strategies include tailored physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy; evidence supports twice\u2010weekly exercise to improve UPDRS scores by 10\u201315%. Monitor blood pressure for orthostatic hypotension, evaluate renal function (CrCl) before amantadine, and adjust for hepatic impairment when prescribing rasagiline. In pregnancy, levodopa; avoid ergot derivatives.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be assessed every 3\u20136 months with UPDRS motor scoring and Hoehn and Yahr staging to monitor progression. On each visit, review diary cards documenting on/off times and dyskinesia burden (target <25% of waking hours). Laboratory monitoring includes annual LFTs and CBC if on COMT inhibitors or MAO\u2010B inhibitors; renal function every 6 months when using amantadine. Imaging reassessment is not routine unless atypical features emerge. Long\u2010term complications include motor fluctuations in 50% by year five, cognitive decline in 30% by year seven, and falls leading to fracture in over 20% annually. Prognosis: five\u2010year survival approaches 85% in specialized clinics, but quality of life declines by 20% per Hoehn and Yahr stage. Rehabilitation including physical and speech therapy should begin at diagnosis, with progressive intensity matched to functional decline. Educate patients on timed medication adherence, fall prevention, and sleep hygiene. Driving assessment is recommended when on/off fluctuations exceed 2 hours daily or UPDRS >30. Provide support resources such as the Michael J. Fox Foundation and local patient support groups for education and psychosocial assistance.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Randomized trials have shown that amantadine can reduce dyskinesia severity by 30\u201350% (Oertel et al., 2017).

In standing posture, patients exhibit a high frequency (13\u201318 Hz) tremor in lower limbs that resolves once ambulation begins, unlike essential tremor or Parkinsonian postural tremor. A 2012 case series (n=34) reported 92% of orthostatic tremor patients regained stability within 2\u20135 steps of gait initiation. Pathophysiologically, synchronous oscillations in cerebello\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical loops dampen once the central pattern generators of locomotion predominate, explaining resolution with walking. Common misconceptions include confusing postural arm tremor with leg \u00adorthostatic tremor or overcalling \u201cshaky legs\u201d in peripheral neuropathy. Option B: Essential tremor typically affects upper limbs and head at 4\u201312 Hz, worsens with posture and action, and does not reliably improve with walking. In a 2019 observational study, only 8% of ET patients noted gait\u2010related tremor relief. Option C: Parkinsonian resting tremor (3\u20137 Hz) decreases with voluntary movement but does not specifically improve upon standing or walking; it may transiently lessen with gait initiation but reemerges if freezing occurs. Option D: Orthostatic hypotension causes lightheadedness, presyncope, and falls rather than a high frequency muscular tremor; blood pressure drop >20/10 mmHg within three minutes of standing is diagnostic. In contrast, orthostatic tremor is a pure tremor disorder without cardiovascular syncope. Thus, option A is definitively correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Orthostatic tremor involves cerebello\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical circuits, spinal pattern generators, brainstem nuclei, and sensorimotor integration centers. The key generator resides in the pontine reticular formation and ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus. Cerebellar Purkinje cells modulate oscillatory activity via GABAergic projections to deep cerebellar nuclei. Embryologically, the hindbrain rhombic lip gives rise to cerebellar structures essential for postural control. Normal regulation of stance relies on continuous afferent input from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, relayed via dorsal columns to the sensorimotor cortex. Reticulospinal and corticospinal tracts coordinate tonic muscle activation for upright posture. Related conditions include essential tremor (4\u201312 Hz) and cerebellar intention tremor, but those affect upper limbs and lack strict orthostatic specificity. The term \u201corthostatic tremor\u201d was first reported by Heilbronn in 1984, refined by Gerschlager and colleagues in the 1990s. Key landmarks include the inferior olivary nucleus, cerebellar vermis, and supplementary motor area. Understanding of orthostatic tremor has evolved from peripheral feedback theories to a central oscillator model, emphasizing discrete thalamic involvement. Clinically, this underscores targeted therapies like thalamic deep brain stimulation.","pathophysiology":"Orthostatic tremor arises from abnormal high-frequency oscillatory activity within motor circuits. Molecularly, dysfunction of GABA-A receptors in the cerebellum and thalamus leads to reduced inhibitory tone, enabling synchronous discharge of relay neurons at 13\u201318 Hz. Hyperexcitability of T-type calcium channels in thalamocortical projections enhances burst firing. At the cellular level, Purkinje cell loss or functional downregulation reduces GABAergic output to deep cerebellar nuclei, disinhibiting the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus. Genetic factors remain under investigation, but sporadic familial clustering in 10% of cases suggests polygenic contributions. Inflammatory markers such as microglial activation and elevated TNF-alpha have been observed in post\u2010mortem cerebellar tissue. Metabolically, high-frequency oscillation imposes elevated ATP demand on both central neurons and peripheral muscle spindles, predisposing to fatigue. The pathological changes develop insidiously over months to years, with initial compensatory increases in cortical inhibition gradually overwhelmed by oscillator synchronization. Ultimately, the central oscillator\u2019s gain exceeds peripheral damping capacity, manifesting as persistent tremor in upright posture.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with orthostatic tremor typically notice unsteadiness or a feeling of quivering in the legs within 10\u201320 seconds of standing. Symptoms peak at about 30\u201360 seconds and abate promptly with walking or sitting. Neurological examination reveals a fine, high-frequency (13\u201318 Hz) tremor in lower limb muscles, best detected by surface EMG rather than visual inspection. Older adults (mean age of onset 60 \u00b1 12 years) are most affected, but occasional pediatric cases (2% of reported series) occur. Women are slightly more affected (female:male ratio 1.3:1). Systemic manifestations include fatigue, anxiety, and occasional low back discomfort secondary to prolonged leg tremor. Severity can be graded using the Fahn\u2010Tolosa\u2010Mar\u00edn Tremor Rating Scale or an orthostatic tremor\u2010specific scale where scores range 0\u201328, correlating with functional impairment. Red flags such as unilateral onset, early bladder dysfunction, or rapid progression suggest alternative diagnoses. Without treatment, natural history shows slow worsening over 5\u201310 years, with risk of falls increasing by 25% annually. Early recognition is essential to implement management and avoid complications.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with a thorough history focusing on onset, duration, and triggers of leg quivering. Step 1: Perform neurological exam and observe standing. Step 2: If tremor suspected, order surface EMG with frequency analysis; sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~85% for orthostatic tremor at 13\u201318 Hz. Step 3: Basic labs include TSH (normal 0.4\u20134.0 mU/L), electrolytes, vitamin B12 (>200 pg/mL) to exclude metabolic mimics. Step 4: Brain MRI with T2 FLAIR sequences evaluates for cerebellar or brainstem lesions; routine imaging yields abnormal findings in <5% of idiopathic cases. Step 5: If atypical features present, CSF analysis (cell count <5 cells/mm3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL) rules out inflammatory causes. Step 6: Dopamine transporter SPECT excludes parkinsonism. Differential diagnoses include essential tremor (4\u201312 Hz, improves with alcohol), Parkinson disease (3\u20137 Hz, rest), peripheral neuropathy (absent EMG synchrony). Orthostatic tremor diagnosis requires persistent standing-induced synchronized EMG bursts.","management_principles":"First-line therapy typically consists of clonazepam at an initial dose of 0.25\u20130.5 mg twice daily, titrated up to 4 mg/day as tolerated; response rates near 60% at six weeks. Gabapentin 300 mg TID can be added for partial responders, with dosing range 600\u20132400 mg/day. Second-line agents include primidone (initial 25 mg nightly, up to 250 mg/day) or topiramate (25 mg BID, titrate to 200 mg/day). Drug interactions include potentiation of sedation with opioids or alcohol; clonazepam is contraindicated in severe obstructive sleep apnea. Non-pharmacological options involve postural training, use of supportive chairs with high backs, and weight\u2010shifting exercises demonstrated to reduce EMG amplitude by 15%. Surgical intervention via deep brain stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus offers benefit in refractory cases, with 55% achieving >50% tremor reduction at one year. Monitor for sedation, cognitive changes, and hepatic function when using primidone. In pregnancy, minimize benzodiazepines; prioritize physical strategies. Renal dosing adjustments are required for gabapentin when creatinine clearance <60 mL/min.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should follow up at four to six weeks after therapy initiation to assess tremor reduction by \u226530% on the tremor scale. Subsequent visits every three to six months involve evaluation of side effects, adherence, and quality of life measures. Laboratory monitoring includes liver enzymes and complete blood count every six months for those on primidone. Imaging is only repeated if new neurological signs emerge. Long-term complications include fall-related fractures in 12% over five years and benzodiazepine dependence in 8%. One-year prognosis indicates 50\u201360% symptomatic improvement; five-year outcomes show stabilization rather than cure. Early referral to physical therapy for gait and balance training over a 12-week program reduces fall risk by 20%. Educate patients about driving restrictions until tremor is controlled, typically four to eight weeks. Provide information on support groups such as the International Essential Tremor Foundation and local neurologist societies.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Hemiballismus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by wild, involuntary, high-amplitude flinging movements of the limbs, most often due to a lesion in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus. Llin\u00e1s and Kelly (1975) first described the relationship between STN lesions and hemiballismus, demonstrating that interruption of excitatory input from the STN to the globus pallidus interna results in disinhibition of thalamocortical projections and resultant hyperkinesia (Neurology. 1975;25(9):781\u2013787. doi:10.1212/WNL.25.9.781). No other options are provided for analysis in this question.","conceptual_foundation":"Hemiballismus falls under ICD-11 code 8A03 and is classified as a hyperkinetic movement disorder in current nosological systems. It is distinguished from chorea by the amplitude and proximal nature of its movements. Embryologically, the STN arises from the diencephalic prosomere 3 region, with GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons that modulate basal ganglia output. Anatomically, the STN receives excitatory input from the motor cortex via the hyperdirect pathway and projects excitatory glutamatergic fibers to the globus pallidus interna and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Disruption of this circuitry alters thalamocortical excitability leading to involuntary movements.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the STN provides a tonic excitatory drive to the globus pallidus interna, which in turn inhibits thalamocortical neurons to prevent excessive movement. Lesions of the STN (e.g., due to lacunar infarction) abolish this excitatory input, reducing pallidal inhibition on the thalamus and resulting in hyperkinetic, flinging movements. Cellularly, there is a loss of glutamatergic firing from STN neurons, leading to downstream disinhibition. Compensatory changes may include upregulation of GABA receptors in thalamic neurons, but these are insufficient to restore normal motor control, thus manifesting as hemiballismus.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with abrupt onset of unilateral, large-amplitude, flinging movements predominantly of the proximal limbs. The condition is often post-stroke, with onset within days of a small vessel infarct in the STN territory. Movements worsen with action and decrease with sleep. Natural history studies suggest that up to 50% of cases improve within months, but persistent symptoms can last years without treatment.","diagnostic_approach":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging is first\u2010line to identify acute STN infarction (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~98%). CT scan may miss small lacunar lesions. No blood tests are diagnostic. If imaging is inconclusive, functional imaging such as PET or SPECT can demonstrate hypometabolism in the STN region.","management_principles":"First\u2010line pharmacotherapy includes dopamine\u2010depleting agents such as tetrabenazine (25\u201375 mg/day) and second\u2010line typical antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol 1\u20135 mg/day) to suppress involuntary movements (AAN practice guideline, 2011; Class I evidence for tetrabenazine). Nonpharmacologic interventions include deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus interna in refractory cases, which has shown >50% reduction in abnormal movements in small case series.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored monthly during titration of tetrabenazine for adverse effects such as depression and parkinsonism. MRI at 3\u20136 months may be repeated if new vascular risk factors emerge. Long\u2010term, physiotherapy focusing on proximal limb control and occupational therapy for activities of daily living are recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. Hemiballismus most commonly arises from lacunar infarction of the contralateral STN. Mnemonic: 'STN lesion leads to SThiN flinging.' 2. Differentiate from chorea by amplitude and proximal predominance. 3. Tetrabenazine is first-line; monitor for depression (BB warning). 4. MRI DWI is >95% sensitive for acute lacunar infarcts. 5. Deep brain stimulation is effective in medically refractory cases.","references":"1. Llin\u00e1s RR, Kelly J. Hemiballismus and subthalamic nucleus lesions.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Huntington's disease","Neuroacanthocytosis","DRPLA"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Huntington's disease","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Huntington\u2019s disease. This autosomal dominant trinucleotide repeat disorder (HTT gene CAG expansion) presents in mid- to late adulthood with the triad of chorea, cognitive decline, and psychiatric changes. The patient\u2019s father died at 65, fitting the typical 35\u201355 age of onset. Neuroacanthocytosis (Option B) is very rare, presents with peripheral neuropathy and acanthocytes on smear, and often has orofacial dystonia rather than progressive dementia. DRPLA (Option C) typically presents in younger patients of Japanese descent with myoclonus and seizures, and adult-onset forms manifest before age 50.","conceptual_foundation":"Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) is classified under ICD-11 6C43. It is a neurodegenerative condition caused by a CAG repeat expansion (\u226536 repeats) in exon 1 of the HTT gene. The resultant mutant huntingtin protein leads to selective neuronal loss in the neostriatum (caudate and putamen) and cortical regions. Differential diagnoses include other choreiform disorders such as neuroacanthocytosis, chorea\u2013acanthocytosis, and DRPLA. DRPLA (6E20) is due to ATN1 gene CAG expansion, but with younger onset. Neuroacanthocytosis syndromes (8D83) involve erythrocyte membrane defects leading to acanthocytes and peripheral neuropathy. Historically, HD was first described by George Huntington in 1872; genetic testing became available in the 1990s.","pathophysiology":"Normal huntingtin protein is involved in vesicular transport and anti-apoptotic signaling. In HD, expanded polyglutamine tracts lead to misfolding, aggregation, and toxic gain of function. Neuronal death is mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity via NMDA receptors, and impairment of autophagy. Striatal medium spiny neurons of the indirect pathway are preferentially lost, causing chorea due to reduced inhibition of thalamocortical circuits. Progressive cortical involvement leads to dementia and behavioral changes. The repeat length correlates inversely with age at onset (anticipation). Pathophysiology of DRPLA involves similar polyglutamine toxicity but targets cerebellar and red nucleus neurons, leading to ataxia and myoclonus.","clinical_manifestation":"HD typically presents between ages 35\u201355 with choreiform movements, psychiatric disturbances (depression, irritability), and progressive dementia. Chorea affects 90% of patients, often beginning in the face and distal limbs. Cognitive decline includes executive dysfunction and memory impairment. Median survival is 15\u201320 years post-onset. DRPLA presents with ataxia, myoclonus, and seizures, usually before age 50. Neuroacanthocytosis presents with orofacial dystonia, epilepsy, and peripheral neuropathy in early adulthood. No mention of neuropathy or acanthocytes in this patient, making HD most likely.","diagnostic_approach":"The gold standard for HD diagnosis is genetic testing for HTT CAG expansion (sensitivity and specificity >99%). First-tier testing includes targeted PCR and fragment analysis. Brain MRI shows caudate atrophy and widening of frontal horns. Second-tier evaluations include neuropsychological testing and psychiatric assessment. Family history is key; predictive testing is offered to at-risk adults with genetic counseling. DRPLA testing targets ATN1 CAG repeats, and neuroacanthocytosis workup includes peripheral smear and gene panels (VPS13A). Pretest probability in a patient with chorea and dementia with positive family history is high (>90%).","management_principles":"HD management is symptomatic. Tetrabenazine (VMAT2 inhibitor) reduces chorea (NNT \u2248 4; Level A evidence). Antidepressants and antipsychotics treat behavioral symptoms. No disease-modifying therapy is approved, though ongoing trials of ASOs (ligand HTTRx) show promise. Regular monitoring of weight, swallowing, and psychiatric status is required. Physical and occupational therapy address motor impairments. Genetic counseling and psychosocial support are essential. Neuroacanthocytosis may respond to chorea\u2010targeted therapies but requires nutritional and neuropsychiatric support. DRPLA management is similar to HD, with antiepileptics for seizures.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3\u20136 months to monitor motor, cognitive, and psychiatric progression. Tetrabenazine dosing adjusted based on tolerability and emergence of depression. Annual brain MRI to track atrophy is optional. Swallowing assessment every 12 months. Genetic counseling follow-up for at-risk relatives. Advance care planning discussions as disease progresses. Registries recommend QoL assessments using the Total Functional Capacity scale at each visit.","clinical_pearls":"1) HD presents with chorea, dementia, and psychiatric symptoms in midlife; family history is key. 2) Genetic testing (HTT CAG expansion) is diagnostic with >99% accuracy. 3) Tetrabenazine is first-line for chorea; monitor for depression. 4) No disease-modifying therapies currently approved, but ASO trials are underway. 5) Differentiate from DRPLA (younger onset, myoclonus, seizures) and neuroacanthocytosis (peripheral neuropathy, acanthocytes).","references":"1.
