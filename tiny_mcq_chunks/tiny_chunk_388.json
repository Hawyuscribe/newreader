Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is characterized by a slow spike-and-wave pattern on EEG, typically at 1.5\u20132.5 Hz. This finding is diagnostic in the context of multiple seizure types and cognitive impairment. West syndrome (option B) shows hypsarrhythmia, a chaotic high-voltage multifocal spike-and-wave pattern. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (option C) shows generalized 4\u20136 Hz polyspike-and-wave discharges. Temporal lobe epilepsy (option D) demonstrates focal interictal spikes or sharp waves over the temporal regions. Thus, only Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is associated with slow spike-and-wave.","conceptual_foundation":"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a pediatric-onset epileptic encephalopathy. It is classified in the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification under generalized epilepsies with multiple seizure types. Etiologies include cortical malformations, genetic mutations (e.g., CHD2, GABRB3), and perinatal insults. The slow spike-and-wave pattern reflects widespread cortical dysfunction and thalamocortical network disruption. Embryologically, the thalamocortical projections that underlie this oscillation originate from dorsal thalamic nuclei and develop in mid-gestation.","pathophysiology":"Normal thalamocortical circuits generate rhythmic oscillations in the alpha and sleep spindle ranges. In Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, alterations in GABAergic inhibition and NMDA receptor\u2013mediated excitation lead to abnormally slow oscillatory activity (1.5\u20132.5 Hz). Mutations in genes encoding ion channels and GABA receptor subunits disrupt interneuron function, resulting in widespread cortical synchrony and slow spike-and-wave discharges.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present between ages 1 and 8 years with multiple seizure types: tonic, atonic (\u2018drop attacks\u2019), atypical absence, and generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures. Cognitive impairment and behavioral problems are universal. Tonic seizures often occur during sleep. The natural history is of progressive encephalopathy with refractory epilepsy and developmental delay.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical and electrographic. First-tier evaluation includes EEG demonstrating slow spike-and-wave discharges during wakefulness and bursts of fast activity during sleep. MRI is performed to identify structural etiologies (malformations of cortical development, tuberous sclerosis). Genetic panels may identify pathogenic variants (e.g., CHD2, GABRB3).","management_principles":"Treatment is multimodal. First-line pharmacotherapy includes valproate, lamotrigine, and rufinamide. The ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation are adjunctive. First-tier agents: valproate (Level A), lamotrigine (Level B). Rufinamide reduces drop attacks by ~60% (Class I evidence).","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up every 3\u20136 months to monitor seizure control, cognitive development, and medication side effects. Annual EEG to assess evolution of background rhythms. Neuropsychological evaluation yearly to guide educational interventions.","clinical_pearls":"1. Slow spike-and-wave (1.5\u20132.5 Hz) is pathognomonic for Lennox-Gastaut. 2. Atonic \u2018drop attacks\u2019 are common and lead to injuries. 3. High risk of status epilepticus\u2014prepare rescue medications. 4. Consider ketogenic diet early in treatment-resistant cases. 5.

Oral automatisms (lip smacking, chewing motions) are ictal semiology characteristic of temporal lobe seizures and are not seen in convulsive syncope (Fisher et al. 2014 classification). Option A (rhythmic clonus) may be seen in both syncope and tonic\u2010clonic seizures and is nonspecific. Option B (multifocal myoclonus) can occur post\u2010ictal or in metabolic encephalopathies but not as a localizing ictal sign. Option D (up rolling of eyes) is a frequent finding in syncope due to brainstem\u2010mediated oculogyric responses and thus not specific for epilepsy.","conceptual_foundation":"Syncope with brief myoclonic jerks can mimic generalized tonic\u2010clonic seizure. Differentiating features include duration of unconsciousness (<30 s in syncope vs >1 min in seizure), pallor vs cyanosis, and semiologic signs. Oral automatisms are automatisms\u2014complex, voluntary\u2010appearing behaviors\u2014indicative of seizure origin in the temporal lobe (ILAE 2017).","pathophysiology":"Temporal lobe seizures arise from hyperexcitable neuronal networks in the hippocampus and amygdala. Ictal propagation to the orbitofrontal cortex generates automatisms via disinhibition of basal ganglia motor loops. In contrast, syncope results from transient global cerebral hypoperfusion leading to brief neuronal shutdown without the focal network activation required for automatisms.","clinical_manifestation":"Ictal oral automatisms occur in 30\u201370% of temporal lobe seizures, often accompanied by impaired awareness. The patient may exhibit lip smacking or chewing for several seconds. Postictal confusion (lasting minutes) further supports seizure diagnosis, whereas syncope recovery is usually rapid and complete (seconds).","diagnostic_approach":"Video\u2010EEG monitoring capturing ictal events is gold standard. Ictal EEG in temporal lobe seizures shows rhythmic 3\u20135 Hz theta activity over temporal leads. Tilt\u2010table testing and carotid sinus massage can provoke syncope but will not elicit automatisms. MRI brain to exclude structural lesions in new\u2010onset seizures.","management_principles":"Initiate antiepileptic therapy directed at focal seizures, typically carbamazepine or lamotrigine (Level A evidence, SANAD trial). Address vascular risk factors but do not treat as syncope. Oral automatisms portend good response to monotherapy. Avoid unnecessary cardiac pacemaker insertion.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up EEG at 6 months to assess interictal epileptiform discharges. Monitor medication levels and adverse effects every 3 months initially. Assess driving fitness after seizure control for 12 months per local regulations.","clinical_pearls":"1. Automatisms are pathognomonic for focal seizures with impaired awareness. 2. Postictal confusion lasting >1 min favors epilepsy. 3. Up\u2010rolling eyes is seen in syncope. 4. Rhythmic clonus alone cannot distinguish syncope from seizure. 5. Multifocal myoclonus suggests metabolic or postictal state, not diagnostic of seizure.","references":"1. Fisher RS, et al.

Typical absence seizures are characterized on EEG by generalized, symmetric 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharges (Panayiotopoulos CP, 2010). This finding has a sensitivity of approximately 90% and specificity >95% for childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) in multiple cohort studies (AAN guideline, 2016). Option B (West syndrome) is incorrect because West syndrome, or infantile spasms, shows a hypsarrhythmic pattern of high-amplitude chaotic slow waves with multifocal spikes, not a regular 3-Hz spike-and-wave. A common misconception is to confuse any generalized spike activity with West syndrome, but the age of onset (<1\u2009year) and hypsarrhythmia differentiate it from absence seizures. No major guidelines endorse 3 Hz spike-and-wave for West syndrome (NASPGHAN, 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding 3-Hz spike-and-wave requires grasping the classification of generalized epilepsies under the ILAE 2017 framework. Absence seizures fall under 'Genetic Generalized Epilepsies' (previously 'Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsies'). The EEG signature arises from thalamocortical network oscillations. Differential diagnoses include juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (4-6 Hz polyspike-and-wave) and tonic-clonic seizures (no rhythmic spike-and-wave). Historically, the nosology evolved from phenomenology (Lennox, 1950s) to genetic and network-based classifications. Embryologically, thalamocortical circuits develop by midgestation; dysfunction in GABAergic reticular nucleus projections underlies absence pathophysiology. Neuroanatomic correlates include interplay between the reticular thalamic nucleus, ventrobasal thalamus, and cortical pyramidal cells mediated by T-type calcium channels.","pathophysiology":"Normal thalamocortical circuits regulate cortical excitability via GABAergic reticular nucleus inhibition. In absence epilepsy, mutations in CACNA1H (T-type Ca2+ channels) or GABRG2 (GABA_A receptor subunit) lead to hypersynchrony (Barsh et al., 2019). Excessive bursting in the reticular nucleus generates rhythmic 3-Hz oscillations transmitted to cortex. Compensatory inhibition fails, and generalized spike-and-wave emerges. This differs from West syndrome, where diffuse cortical dysfunction yields chaotic hypsarrhythmia. The absence seizure\u2019s abrupt onset and termination reflect rapid network entrainment and disengagement, while West syndrome involves persistent, high-amplitude discharges without discrete seizure boundaries.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical absence seizures present in children aged 4\u201310 with sudden, brief (5\u201320 s) impairment of awareness, often with eyelid flutter and automatisms. They occur multiple times daily (up to hundreds), frequently mistaken for daydreaming. Prodromal features are minimal. Natural history: untreated CAE may remit in adolescence, but 10\u201320% progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Diagnostic criteria (ILAE 2017) require generalized 3-Hz spike-and-wave on EEG and clinical absence episodes. Sensitivity of criteria ~85%, specificity ~90%. Atypical absence seizures feature slower (<2.5 Hz) spike-and-wave and more pronounced motor findings.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Routine awake and sleep-deprived EEG capturing hyperventilation-induced 3-Hz spike-and-wave (Grade A, AAN 2016), sensitivity 90%, specificity 95%.

No neuroimaging required unless focal features or abnormal exam.","management_principles":"First-line therapy: Ethosuximide (500\u20131000 mg/day) or valproate (20\u201330 mg/kg/day) (AAN Class I evidence; Glauser et al., 2010). Ethosuximide has remission rates ~60% at 1 year; valproate ~70% but with higher teratogenicity. Lamotrigine is second-line. Non-pharmacologic: Ketogenic diet may help refractory cases (level B). Avoid driving until seizure-free for 6 months. Pregnancy: ethosuximide preferred over valproate. Dose adjustments guided by clinical response and serum levels (valproate therapeutic range 50\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3 months initially, then biannually once stable. Monitor complete blood count, liver function (valproate), and for sedation or GI side effects. Annual EEG for research, not routine.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple seizure types, EEG slow (<2.5 Hz) spike-and-wave, and intellectual disability. Over 80% of patients are drug-resistant despite polytherapy (Wirrell et al., 2015). Option B (Peak onset 5\u201310 years) is incorrect because the typical onset is between 1 and 7 years, with mean age around 3\u20135 years (AAN guideline, 2017). Many misconceptions place LGS onset in school age due to later recognition of cognitive plateauing, but primary seizures appear in early childhood.","conceptual_foundation":"LGS is classified under 'Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies' in the ILAE 2017 system. Differential includes Dravet syndrome, Doose syndrome, and severe myoclonic epilepsy. Historically described by Henri Gastaut in the 1960s, it replaced terms like 'petit mal variant.' Embryologically, widespread cortical dysgenesis or perinatal insults predispose to encephalopathy. Neuroanatomically, diffuse bilateral cortical and thalamic involvement explains mixed seizure types (tonic, atonic, atypical absence). Genetic mutations in GABRB3 and CHD2 are implicated in up to 30% of cases.","pathophysiology":"Normal inhibitory and excitatory balance is disrupted in LGS by GABAergic interneuron dysfunction and impaired voltage-gated ion channel regulation (e.g., SCN1A, CACNA1A). The slow (<2.5 Hz) spike-and-wave arises from hypersynchronous thalamocortical circuits with prolonged depolarization. Structural lesions (periventricular leukomalacia, cortical dysplasia) further impede network integration. Cellular changes include interneuron loss, astrocytic gliosis, and synaptic reorganization. This contrasts with absence epilepsy, where discrete T-type channel mutations lead to 3 Hz oscillations without encephalopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"LGS presents between 1 and 7 years with multiple daily seizures: tonic (neck/facial extension), atonic ('drop attacks'), myoclonic, and atypical absence. Cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbances are universal. Seizure frequency often >100 per day. Prognosis is poor: <10% achieve prolonged remission.
