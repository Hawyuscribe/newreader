[{"question_number":"2","question":"An 11-year-old girl is referred with rapidly deteriorating school performance and intellectual deficits over a course of a few weeks. She also has frequent seizures and unsteady gait. On examination, she has ataxia, hyperreflexia, and bilateral upgoing plantar responses. An electroencephalogram (EEG) shows periodic bursts of high voltage slow waves followed by recurrent low voltage stretches. Clinically, she is worsening with an on-off lethargic state. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows large areas of signal change. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)","Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)",""],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most likely diagnosis is Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD). Rapidly progressive dementia over weeks, myoclonus, periodic sharp\u2010wave complexes on EEG, and MRI signal changes in cortex/basal ganglia are classic for CJD. Option A, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, occurs in immunosuppressed patients, shows nonenhancing demyelinating white\u2010matter lesions on MRI, and does not produce periodic EEG complexes. Option C is not specified and cannot account for the full clinical and EEG findings described.","conceptual_foundation":"Prion diseases such as CJD are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies characterized by misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) aggregates. They are classified under neurodegenerative dementias in ICD-11 and DSM-5-TR. Differential diagnoses include rapidly progressive Alzheimer\u2019s disease, autoimmune encephalitis, viral encephalitis, and paraneoplastic syndromes. CJD may be sporadic (85%), familial (10\u201315%), or acquired (<1%). The key pathologic substrate is the conversion of normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a pathological, \u03b2\u2010sheet\u2013rich isoform (PrPSc) that aggregates and leads to neuronal loss and spongiform change.","pathophysiology":"Normal PrPC undergoes conformational change to PrPSc, which templates further misfolding of PrPC. This leads to accumulation of protease-resistant aggregates, neuronal vacuolation, astrocytosis, and synaptic loss. The pathophysiologic cascade involves altered calcium homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and activation of apoptotic pathways. Spongiform vacuoles develop in gray matter, especially cortex and deep nuclei, correlating with rapidly progressive neurodegeneration and myoclonus.","clinical_manifestation":"Sporadic CJD presents at age 60\u201365 years with rapidly progressive dementia over weeks to months, myoclonus (80%), visual or cerebellar signs (40\u201350%), pyramidal/extrapyramidal features (60%), and akinetic mutism in late stages. Seizures are uncommon but myoclonic jerks can be mistaken for seizures. CSF 14-3-3 protein is positive in ~85% of cases. MRI DWI shows cortical ribboning and high signal in caudate/putamen in ~90% of patients.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm for CJD includes MRI brain with DWI (high sensitivity/specificity for cortical ribboning and basal ganglia hyperintensity), EEG (periodic sharp\u2010wave complexes, sensitivity ~65\u201370%, specificity ~75\u201385%), and CSF biomarkers (14-3-3 protein, total tau). Definite diagnosis requires neuropathology or PrPSc detection by RT-QuIC (real-time quaking\u2013induced conversion) in CSF or nasal brushings with sensitivity/specificity >90%.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying treatment exists. Care is supportive, focusing on symptom control: clonazepam or valproate for myoclonus, analgesia for pain, physiotherapy, and palliative care. Experimental therapies (pentosan polysulfate, doxycycline) have not shown clear benefit. Genetic counseling is indicated in familial forms. Strict infection control precautions should be observed for surgical instruments.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients decline rapidly; median survival is ~4\u20136 months. Follow-up focuses on symptomatic management, ensuring nutrition and hydration, pressure-area care, and discussion of advanced directives. Family support and hospice referral are critical. No serial imaging or EEG is routinely indicated once the diagnosis is established and the prognosis discussed.","clinical_pearls":"1. Periodic sharp-wave complexes on EEG are highly suggestive of CJD but not pathognomonic. 2. MRI DWI signal in basal ganglia and cortical ribboning has >90% sensitivity/specificity. 3. RT-QuIC assay in CSF has revolutionized ante-mortem diagnosis with >95% accuracy. 4. Myoclonus in CJD often responds to clonazepam or valproate. 5. Always consider infection control protocols for instruments after invasive procedures in suspected CJD.","references":"1. Brown P, Cathala F, Castaigne P.

In contrast, Multiple Sclerosis (Option A) typically presents in younger adults with discrete demyelinating lesions and relapsing\u2013remitting focal neurological deficits rather than global cognitive decline; Depression (Option B) can cause pseudo-dementia but does not produce confluent white matter changes; and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Option C) characteristically shows cortical and hippocampal atrophy with medial temporal lobe involvement rather than diffuse subcortical white matter disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease, encompasses cognitive impairment resulting from cerebrovascular pathology. In subcortical vascular dementia (also called Binswanger\u2019s disease), small vessel arteriolosclerosis leads to chronic ischemia of deep white matter. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. The DSM-5 classification places it under major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to cerebrovascular disease. Differential diagnoses include neurodegenerative dementias (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s disease), demyelinating disorders (e.g., MS), normal pressure hydrocephalus, and late-life depression. The concept evolved from early 20th-century descriptions of \u2018arteriosclerotic dementia\u2019 to refined subtypes based on neuroimaging and neuropathology.","pathophysiology":"Normal subcortical white matter is supplied by penetrating arterioles vulnerable to lipohyalinosis in chronic hypertension. Arteriolar narrowing and endothelial dysfunction lead to hypoperfusion, demyelination, and gliosis. Repeated microinfarcts and lacunes disrupt frontal\u2013subcortical circuits mediating executive function, attention, and gait. Inflammatory cytokines and blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown exacerbate white matter damage. Over time, these microvascular changes manifest as confluent T2/FLAIR hyperintensities on MRI, correlating with cognitive and motor impairment.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with subcortical vascular dementia often present in their 50s\u201370s with insidious decline in executive functions (e.g., planning, multitasking), slowed processing speed, and apathy. Gait disturbance (magnetic or wide-based gait) emerges early due to involvement of frontal lobe\u2013basal ganglia circuits. Urinary urgency and mood changes (apathy, depression) are common. Unlike Alzheimer\u2019s, memory impairment may be milder early on. The natural history is a slowly progressive or stepwise course corresponding to new vascular events.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes detailed cognitive testing focusing on executive function (MoCA, Trail Making Test B) and assessment of gait. Brain MRI is essential: Fazekas scale grading of white matter hyperintensities, identification of lacunes, and exclusion of alternative pathology. Vascular risk factors should be documented. DSM-5 criteria for major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease require a temporal relationship between a vascular event and cognitive decline. Laboratory tests (CBC, metabolic panel, B12, TSH) exclude reversible causes. Cardiac and carotid imaging identify embolic sources when appropriate.","management_principles":"No approved disease-modifying therapy exists. Management targets vascular risk factor control: strict blood pressure reduction (goal <130/80 mm Hg per AHA/ASA 2011), statin therapy, glycemic control, smoking cessation, and antiplatelet agents when indicated. Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., rivastigmine) may provide modest symptomatic benefit (Level B evidence). Physical and occupational therapy address gait and activities of daily living. Cognitive rehabilitation and caregiver support are integral.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor blood pressure, lipids, and glycemic status every 3\u20136 months. Repeat cognitive assessments (e.g., MoCA) annually or with clinical change. Neuroimaging only if atypical progression or new focal signs. Assess for depression and functional decline at each visit. Adjust therapies based on tolerance and comorbidities.","clinical_pearls":"1. Confluent periventricular white matter hyperintensities with lacunes strongly suggest subcortical vascular dementia. 2. Early gait disturbance and executive dysfunction differentiate from Alzheimer\u2019s. 3. Stepwise decline often correlates with new infarcts\u2014look for vascular risk factors. 4. Strict blood pressure control is the only intervention shown to slow progression (SPRINT-MIND trial). 5. Remember pseudodementia in depression lacks objective MRI changes.","references":"1.

Neurofibrillary tangles. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are intraneuronal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and represent one of the two key histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. NFTs also appear, to varying degrees, in other tauopathies (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal lobar degeneration) and can be seen in elderly brains even in the absence of overt dementia. Option A (\u201cTangles\u201d) is imprecise, whereas option D specifies neurofibrillary tangles. Option B (\u201cGlial cytoplasmic inclusions\u201d) refers to \u03b1-synuclein\u2013positive inclusions in oligodendrocytes seen in multiple system atrophy, a relatively rare condition. Option C (\u201cLewy bodies\u201d) are intraneuronal \u03b1-synuclein aggregates characteristic of Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, but these are less prevalent overall compared with NFTs when considering all major neurodegenerative diseases combined. Numerous neuropathological series report NFTs in > 80% of cases of Alzheimer\u2019s and in a subset of other tauopathies, making them the commonest change across neurodegenerative disorders.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of specific neuronal populations and accumulation of misfolded proteins. Under the World Health Organization\u2019s ICD-11, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (F00), Parkinson\u2019s disease (6A40), and related disorders are grouped under \u2018neurological diseases due to degenerative processes.\u2019 Tangles are classified in neuropathology by the protein composition (tau in NFTs, \u03b1-synuclein in Lewy bodies, TDP-43 in TDP-43 proteinopathies). Historically, Alzheimer first described neurofibrillary changes in 1907, and subsequent work by Braak and Braak (1991) formalized staging of NFT deposition. Embryologically, the hippocampal pyramidal neurons\u2014among the first to accumulate NFTs\u2014derive from the pallium. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein encoded by the MAPT gene on chromosome 17; alternative splicing yields six isoforms with 3 or 4 microtubule-binding repeats. NFTs form when tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, detaches from microtubules, and aggregates into paired helical filaments. Blood supply to affected regions (e.g., entorhinal cortex via anterior choroidal and posterior cerebral arteries) does not appear to influence NFT deposition directly.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, tau stabilizes microtubules in axons, facilitating axonal transport. In Alzheimer\u2019s and other tauopathies, kinases (e.g., GSK-3\u03b2, CDK5) hyperphosphorylate tau, reducing its affinity for microtubules. Detached tau misfolds, oligomerizes, and assembles into paired helical filaments that aggregate into NFTs. At the molecular level, post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, and glycation promote tau aggregation. NFT deposition leads to microtubule destabilization, impaired axonal transport, synaptic loss, and neuronal death. In contrast, Lewy bodies consist of \u03b1-synuclein filaments, and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy also involve \u03b1-synuclein but with different cell-type specificity. NFTs are more widely distributed across the cortex and hippocampus in Alzheimer\u2019s, whereas Lewy bodies predominate in brainstem nuclei and limbic cortex. The accumulation of NFTs follows a predictable spatiotemporal pattern (Braak staging), beginning in entorhinal cortex (stage I\u2013II), extending to limbic regions (III\u2013IV), and finally isocortex (V\u2013VI).","clinical_manifestation":"Neurofibrillary tangles correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Early NFT deposition in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus manifests as episodic memory impairment. As NFTs spread to association cortices, patients develop language, visuospatial, and executive dysfunction. In tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy, NFTs in the basal ganglia and brainstem produce parkinsonism, gaze palsy, and postural instability. NFT\u2010predominant frontotemporal lobar degeneration presents with behavioral changes and language dysfunction. NFT burden correlates with Braak stage and clinical dementia severity (CERAD and Clinical Dementia Rating). In contrast, Lewy bodies produce visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and REM sleep behavior disorder; glial cytoplasmic inclusions cause autonomic failure and cerebellar ataxia in multiple system atrophy.","diagnostic_approach":"Definitive diagnosis of NFTs requires postmortem histopathology with immunohistochemistry for hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8 antibody). Ante mortem biomarkers include CSF tau/phospho\u2010tau elevation (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90% for Alzheimer\u2019s vs controls) and PET imaging with tau\u2010specific tracers (e.g., [18F]AV\u20101451; sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~80% for Braak stage \u2265 III). First\u2010tier evaluation of suspected Alzheimer\u2019s includes neuropsychological testing, MRI to exclude other causes, and CSF amyloid/tau panel. Second\u2010tier tests involve FDG\u2010PET for hypometabolism patterns and amyloid PET. Tau PET is emerging as a research tool with growing clinical utility. Pre-test probability based on age, family history, and APOE \u03b54 genotype informs biomarker interpretation.","management_principles":"There is no therapy that directly clears NFTs. Current AAN 2021 guidelines recommend cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine; Class I, Level A) and memantine (NMDA antagonist; Class I, Level B) for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Emerging anti\u2010tau immunotherapies (e.g., semorinemab) are under Phase II\u2013III investigation. Management of non\u2010Alzheimer tauopathies is largely supportive, addressing parkinsonism with dopaminergic therapy (levodopa) and spasticity with baclofen. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy are integral. Experimental approaches include tau antisense oligonucleotides and small\u2010molecule aggregation inhibitors.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up focuses on cognitive assessments (e.g., MMSE, MoCA every 6\u201312 months), monitoring for adverse effects of cholinesterase inhibitors, and functional status evaluations (IADLs). MRI surveillance is indicated only if clinical changes suggest alternative pathology. Caregiver support, advanced\u2010care planning, and safety assessments (driving, fall risk) are ongoing. Prognosis correlates with rate of NFT spread; median survival after diagnosis is ~8\u201310 years in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.","clinical_pearls":"1. Neurofibrillary tangles correlate more closely with cognitive decline than amyloid plaque burden (\u2018tau is the motor, amyloid the spark\u2019). Mnemonic: T for Tau = True driver. 2.

In classic Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), dementia and hallucinations tend to occur later in the disease course\u2014typically more than one year after motor symptom onset\u2014and are often related to medication side effects. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), by contrast, is characterized by cognitive decline and recurrent visual hallucinations that arise early or concurrent with parkinsonism, often within the first year or two of motor manifestations. The revised DLB Consortium criteria (McKeith et al., 2017) list fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations, and spontaneous parkinsonism as core features.

In classic Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), dementia and hallucinations tend to occur later in the disease course\u2014typically more than one year after motor symptom onset\u2014and are often related to medication side effects. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), by contrast, is characterized by cognitive decline and recurrent visual hallucinations that arise early or concurrent with parkinsonism, often within the first year or two of motor manifestations. The revised DLB Consortium criteria (McKeith et al., 2017) list fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations, and spontaneous parkinsonism as core features.

APOE4. The apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele is the strongest common genetic risk factor for sporadic late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (LOAD). In a landmark study of 395 individuals from 138 families, Corder et al. (1993) demonstrated that possession of one \u03b54 allele conferred a three-fold increased risk of LOAD, while homozygosity conferred a 12-fold risk (Science. 1993;261(5123):921\u2013923). A meta-analysis of over 25,000 cases and controls showed that the odds ratio (OR) for \u03b54 heterozygotes is 3.2 (95% CI, 2.9\u20133.5) and for homozygotes is 14.9 (95% CI, 11.8\u201318.8) (Lambert et al., Nat Genet. 2013;45(12):1452\u20131458). By contrast, APP (amyloid precursor protein) and PSEN1 (presenilin 1) are rare autosomal dominant early-onset familial AD genes, accounting together for <1% of all AD cases; their penetrance is high but population attributable risk is low. MAPT encodes tau and is linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration rather than Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Thus, APOE4 is the gene most commonly linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the general population.","conceptual_foundation":"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a 299-amino-acid protein involved in lipid transport and neuronal repair. The three major human isoforms\u2014\u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54\u2014differ by single-amino-acid substitutions at residues 112 and 158. The \u03b54 isoform confers increased amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregation and impaired clearance across the blood\u2013brain barrier. In ICD-11, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is coded as 6D83.0 (early-onset) and 6D83.1 (late-onset). In DSM-5-TR, AD is classified under Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, with or without behavioral disturbance. Differential diagnoses include vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Historically, APP mutations were first identified in 1991 (Goate et al., Nature. 1991;349:704\u2013706) as causes of familial AD; presenilin mutations followed in 1995. APOE \u03b54 was identified in 1993 as a risk allele for sporadic AD, shifting focus from rare early-onset to common late-onset disease. Embryologically, APP and APOE are expressed in neural crest\u2013derived astrocytes and neurons; tau (MAPT) is expressed in neuronal axons. The hippocampus and medial temporal lobes are primary sites of pathology in AD; these structures derive blood supply from the posterior cerebral artery, often subject to watershed dynamics. APOE receptors (LDLR, LRP1) mediate lipid uptake and A\u03b2 clearance; variations in receptor affinity among isoforms underpin differential risk.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: ApoE transports cholesterol to neurons via receptor-mediated endocytosis, supporting synaptogenesis and membrane repair. In \u03b54 carriers, altered domain interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains of ApoE4 enhance A\u03b2 oligomerization and fibrillogenesis. Molecularly, ApoE4 increases activation of microglial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathways, upregulating proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1). APOE4 also impairs autophagic clearance of A\u03b2 via mTOR pathway dysregulation. In contrast, APP and presenilin mutations directly increase production of A\u03b242 over A\u03b240, leading to early amyloid deposition. PSEN1 mutations alter \u03b3-secretase complex activity, raising the A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. MAPT mutations cause aberrant tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles, characteristic of frontotemporal dementias. Temporal progression in \u03b54 carriers includes accelerated amyloid deposition starting 10\u201320 years before symptom onset, with compensatory synaptic remodeling until decompensation and hippocampal atrophy occur. The regional accumulation of A\u03b2 and tau correlates with symptom emergence: memory impairment arises from CA1/subiculum pathology and disconnection of perforant pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"Individuals with one \u03b54 allele develop cognitive symptoms 5\u201310 years earlier than noncarriers; homozygotes manifest 10\u201315 years earlier. Cardinal features include gradual episodic memory decline, impaired learning, and difficulty with orientation. Frequency of ApoE4 among sporadic AD patients is ~40% for heterozygotes and ~16% for homozygotes, versus 14%/1% in controls. Atypical presentations (e.g., posterior cortical atrophy, logopenic aphasia) also occur in \u03b54 carriers. Prodromal mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage may last 3\u20137 years. Early-onset (<65 years) familial AD due to APP/PSEN1 mutations presents similarly but often with faster progression and seizure comorbidity. Natural history without intervention shows progressive decline over 8\u201312 years from symptom onset. NIA-AA criteria (2011) define AD by clinical and biomarker evidence, with sensitivity 82% and specificity 72% against neuropathology. In special populations, \u03b54 effect size is lower in African ancestry (~OR 2.3) compared to European (~OR 3.7). \u03b52 allele appears protective.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Clinical evaluation with standardized cognitive testing (MMSE, MoCA). Genetic testing for APOE genotype is not recommended for routine diagnosis (AAN 2011, Level B). CSF biomarkers: A\u03b242 (sensitivity 85%, specificity 88%), total tau, and p-tau181 (combined panel sensitivity 89%, specificity 90%) (Jack et al., Alzheimers Dement. 2018). Amyloid PET (Florbetapir) has sensitivity 91% and specificity 95% for detecting A\u03b2 pathology (FDA label). Pretest probability is based on age, family history, and clinical presentation. Second-tier: MRI to exclude vascular, neoplastic, or hydrocephalus etiologies; FDG-PET for hypometabolism patterns. Third-tier: Genetic testing for early-onset familial AD when onset <60 or positive family history. Pre- and post-test counseling essential. In resource-limited settings, diagnosis remains clinical supported by structural imaging.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy targeting APOE4 exists currently. Symptomatic treatment per AAN 2021 guidelines includes cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) with modest cognitive benefit (donepezil: 2\u20133-point MMSE improvement over 6 months; NNT=7). Memantine (NMDA antagonist) provides functional stabilization in moderate-severe AD (NNT=9 for clinical benefit). Lifestyle modifications (exercise, Mediterranean diet) show hazard ratio for dementia reduction of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.50\u20130.77) (Scarmeas et al., Ann Neurol. 2018). Emerging gene-therapy trials targeting APOE4 to convert to \u03b52 isoform are in Phase I. Management of comorbidities (vascular risk factors) is recommended (AHA/ASA 2018 Class I). Special considerations: \u03b54 carriers may have increased cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy risk with anti-A\u03b2 immunotherapy (ARIA-E incidence 35% vs. 21% in non-carriers).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be reassessed every 6 months for cognitive and functional status. Monitor MMSE/MoCA, Activities of Daily Living scale. Laboratory (CBC, CMP, TSH, B12) annually. MRI neuromaging every 2\u20133 years or if clinical decline accelerates. Monitor for adverse effects of medications: cholinesterase inhibitors (bradycardia, GI upset) and memantine (headache). Genetic counseling referrals for families of early-onset cases. Transition of care planning, advanced directives, and caregiver support initiated early. Quality of life measures (QoL-AD) should be obtained yearly. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (agitation, depression) managed per APA guidelines.","clinical_pearls":"1. APOE \u03b54 is a risk modifier, not a diagnostic marker: genotype testing is discouraged for asymptomatic individuals (AAN 2011). 2. Homozygosity for \u03b54 confers a 12-fold increased risk: highest common genetic risk for late-onset AD. 3. APP and PSEN1 mutations are rare but fully penetrant causes of early-onset familial AD; consider testing when onset <60. 4. MAPT mutations cause frontotemporal dementia, not AD; tau pathology differs by isoform and distribution. 5. Lifestyle interventions (physical activity, cognitive stimulation) reduce conversion from MCI to AD (RRR 35%), independent of genotype.","references":"1.
