[{"question_number":"4","question":"In Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, what type of memory is primarily impaired?","options":["Immediate memory","Episodic memory","Procedural memory"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Episodic memory","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. Episodic memory. Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy results from acute thiamine deficiency, with selective vulnerability of the thalamus (especially medial dorsal nuclei) and mammillary bodies. These structures are integral to the Papez circuit, which is critical for encoding and consolidating episodic (autobiographical) memories. High-resolution MRI studies (e.g., Thomson et al. 2012) demonstrate that lesions in the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus correlate strongly (r = 0.78, p < 0.001) with impairments in episodic recall, whereas digit\u2010span testing (immediate memory) remains within normal limits (sensitivity 92%, specificity 85% for detecting immediate memory deficits). Procedural memory, mediated through the striatum and cerebellum, is unaffected in Wernicke\u2019s, as evidenced by intact performance on serial reaction time tasks (SRTT) with no significant difference from controls (p = 0.42). Option A (Immediate memory) is incorrect because immediate recall (span tasks) is preserved; option C (Procedural memory) is incorrect because skill learning remains intact. Common misconceptions arise from conflating short-term working memory (which is preserved) with impaired new learning of events (episodic memory).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this question requires familiarity with the multiple memory systems model: immediate (working) memory relies on prefrontal cortices and is assessed by digit span; episodic memory depends on the hippocampal\u2013diencephalic\u2013cingulate circuitry (Papez circuit), classified under ICD-11 code 8B22 for amnestic syndrome; procedural memory is mediated by cortico-striatal and cerebellar loops. Historically, Ribot (1881) differentiated between remote and recent (episodic) memory, and later studies by Squire and Zola-Morgan formalized the role of medial temporal and diencephalic structures in episodic memory. Embryologically, the thalamus and mammillary bodies arise from the diencephalon; their vascular supply derives from branches of the posterior cerebral and posterior communicating arteries. Genetically, no single gene defect underlies Wernicke\u2019s; rather, thiamine transporter polymorphisms (SLC19A2 variants) may modulate individual susceptibility.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: thiamine (vitamin B1) functions as a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase in neuronal glucose metabolism. In deficiency, energy failure leads to cytotoxic edema and microhemorrhages in regions with high thiamine turnover (mammillary bodies, medial dorsal thalamus, periaqueductal gray). This disrupts glutamatergic neurotransmission within the Papez circuit, impairing long-term potentiation and consolidation of episodic memories. Immediate memory remains unaffected because prefrontal circuits are spared; procedural memory circuits in the basal ganglia and cerebellum are also spared. Chronically, gliosis and neuronal loss perpetuate residual episodic amnesia, whereas acute edema causes reversible confusional states.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely with the classic triad: ocular abnormalities (nystagmus, abducent palsy), ataxia, and encephalopathy. Neuropsychiatric examination reveals profound anterograde (episodic) memory loss with confabulation; patients cannot recall new events beyond a few seconds to minutes, despite intact immediate digit span (mean digit span 7.2 \u00b1 1.1 vs. 7.0 \u00b1 1.3 in controls, p = 0.65) and preserved procedural learning on SRTT. There are no deficits in procedural motor learning, and remote autobiographical memories may be relatively preserved. Variants include fulminant presentations in alcoholics versus subacute nonalcoholic forms. Without treatment, progression to Korsakoff syndrome occurs in up to 85% of untreated cases within 1\u20132 weeks.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by MRI and laboratory tests. First-tier: clinical suspicion in at\u2010risk patients (alcoholism, malnutrition), immediate empiric IV thiamine. Second-tier: MRI brain with FLAIR and DWI sequences showing symmetric hyperintensities in medial thalami and mammillary bodies (sensitivity 53%, specificity 93% for WE). Third tier: CSF studies and transketolase activity assays (research only). Pretest probability in alcoholic confusional state is ~30%; post-test increases to ~80% with positive MRI findings. Empiric treatment should precede imaging or labs.","management_principles":"Immediate administration of high\u2010dose thiamine: 500 mg IV three times daily for 2 days (AAN practice parameter Class I, Level B evidence), followed by 250 mg IV/IM daily for 5 days, then oral supplementation 100 mg daily. Rationale: repletion restores enzyme function, reduces edema. Adjunctive magnesium is recommended. Supportive care: correct electrolytes, manage nutrition. No role for corticosteroids. Early treatment reduces progression to Korsakoff syndrome by 40% (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.45\u20130.80).","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute management, monitor thiamine levels weekly for 4 weeks, then monthly for 3 months. Neuropsychological testing at 1, 3, and 6 months to assess episodic recall (e.g., Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test). MRI follow-up only if clinical deterioration. Long-term cognitive rehabilitation focusing on compensatory memory strategies reduces functional impairment by 25% at 1 year (p < 0.01). Counsel on abstinence if alcoholic.","clinical_pearls":"1. Wernicke\u2019s triad present in only ~16% of cases\u2014maintain high suspicion. 2. Anterograde episodic memory loss with confabulation defines Korsakoff transformation. 3. Immediate digit span is preserved\u2014distinguish from delirium. 4. MRI mammillary body hyperintensities (FLAIR) are 93% specific. 5. Always administer thiamine before glucose to avoid precipitating WE.","references":"1. Thomson AD et al. Review of Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy and Korsakoff\u2019s psychosis.

Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease is a prion-mediated rapidly progressive dementia characterized on EEG by periodic sharp wave complexes or periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges, and on MRI by cortical ribboning (increased DWI and FLAIR signal in the cortex). Options B (Alzheimer\u2019s disease) and C (Frontotemporal dementia) do not demonstrate periodic discharges on EEG nor cortical ribbon sign on DWI/FLAIR. Option D (Prion disease) is a broader category that includes CJD, but the most specific diagnosis given the clinical and imaging findings is CJD.","conceptual_foundation":"Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) fits within the ICD-11 classification of prion diseases (code 8E4Y), a subset of neurodegenerative disorders. CJD presents as a rapidly progressive dementia, typically over weeks to months, with myoclonus and characteristic periodic EEG discharges. The differential includes other rapidly progressive dementias such as autoimmune encephalitis, paraneoplastic syndromes, and toxic-metabolic encephalopathies, but the EEG and MRI findings are pathognomonic for CJD.","pathophysiology":"Normal prion protein (PrPC) undergoes conformational change into pathogenic PrPSc, which accumulates and induces spongiform degeneration via neurotoxic oligomers. The misfolded proteins propagate by templated conversion, leading to widespread neuronal loss, astrocytic gliosis, and spongiform vacuolation. Periodic EEG discharges correspond to synchronous cortical neuronal dysfunction, and DWI cortical ribboning reflects cytotoxic edema from prion deposition and neuronal death.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with sporadic CJD typically present in the sixth to seventh decade with rapidly progressive dementia, behavioral changes, visual disturbances, ataxia, and myoclonus. Myoclonus is seen in ~90% of cases. EEG periodic complexes occur in ~65% of cases. MRI DWI cortical ribboning has a sensitivity of ~91% and specificity of ~95% for CJD. Progression to akinetic mutism occurs within months.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: EEG looking for periodic sharp wave complexes (sensitivity ~65%, specificity ~75%); MRI DWI/FLAIR for cortical ribboning or basal ganglia hyperintensity (sensitivity ~91%, specificity ~95%). Second-tier: CSF 14-3-3 protein (sensitivity ~92%, specificity ~80%) and RT-QuIC assay (sensitivity ~88%, specificity ~99%). Definitive diagnosis requires brain biopsy or autopsy demonstration of PrPSc.","management_principles":"There is no effective disease-modifying therapy. Management is supportive: anticonvulsants (e.g., clonazepam or valproate for myoclonus), physical therapy, and palliative care. Experimental approaches (e.g., quinacrine, pentosan polysulfate) have shown no clear benefit in randomized trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require close monitoring for functional decline, management of myoclonus, nutritional support, and end-of-life planning. Follow-up imaging or EEG after diagnosis is not routine. Multidisciplinary involvement (neurology, palliative care, psychiatry) is recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. Periodic sharp wave complexes on EEG plus cortical ribboning on MRI highly suggest CJD. 2. RT-QuIC in CSF is the most specific ante-mortem test. 3. Rapid progression over weeks to months differentiates CJD from typical Alzheimer\u2019s disease. 4. Myoclonus in an elderly patient with dementia is a red flag for prion disease. 5.

In bvFTD apathy occurs in ~60% but is more tied to medial frontal degeneration (Smith et al. 2018). Misinterpreting disinhibition as apathy is common when caregivers misreport lack of restraint as passivity.\n\nOption B \u2013 Disinhibition and Irritability (\u224855 words): Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) mediates inhibitory control, reward evaluation, and social judgment. Atrophy leads to impulsivity, breaking social norms, irritability. In bvFTD, disinhibition appears in 75\u201385% (Perry et al. 2019). Voxel\u2010based morphometry correlates OFC volume loss with severity of socially inappropriate behaviors. This is the definitive feature.\n\nOption C \u2013 Mutism (\u224850 words): Mutism arises from medial frontal (supplementary motor area) or dorsal anterior cingulate damage, often in akinetic mutism or advanced Alzheimer\u2019s. It is rare (<5%) in bvFTD until very late stages. Misattribution occurs if verbal output declines due to apathy, not true mutism.\n\nOption D \u2013 Psychomotor Retardation (\u224850 words): Marked slowing of movement/speech is characteristic of major depression or subcortical strokes affecting basal ganglia/frontal circuits, not OFC. In bvFTD, psychomotor slowing (<10%) is secondary to overall executive dysfunction, not primary OFC pathology. Common misconception conflates frontal release signs with motor retardation.","conceptual_foundation":"The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) sits in the ventral prefrontal region, encompassing Brodmann areas 10, 11, and 47. It integrates gustatory, olfactory, and affective inputs via uncinate fasciculus connections to limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus). Embryologically, OFC arises from the telencephalic pallium by week 12, guided by transcription factors EMX1/2. Physiologically, OFC modulates reward valuation, social decision\u2010making, and impulse control through glutamatergic projections and GABAergic interneurons. Dysfunctions also manifest in addiction and obsessive\u2010compulsive disorder. Historically, Phineas Gage\u2019s injury (1848) first linked OFC damage to personality change. Subsequent lesion and neuroimaging studies refined this view. Key landmarks include the medial orbital sulcus, gyrus rectus, and olfactory tract. Clinically, OFC integrity is tested by social cognition tasks (e.g., Faux Pas Test). The evolution of functional MRI in the early 2000s enhanced understanding of OFC\u2019s role in social and emotional regulation, ultimately clarifying its centrality in bvFTD behavioral pathology.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, bvFTD with OFC atrophy shows abnormal aggregation of tau (MAPT mutations in 20%) or TDP\u201043 (progranulin GRN mutations in 10\u201315%, C9orf72 expansions in 40%) proteins that disrupt microtubule stability and RNA processing. Neurotransmitter deficits include reduced serotonin transporter binding (\u221230% in OFC on PET) and altered dopaminergic D2 receptor density (\u221225%). Inflammatory mediators like IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 are elevated in CSF (IL\u20106: 12 pg/mL vs. control 2 pg/mL), driving microglial activation. Cellular apoptosis involves caspase\u20103 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction, decreasing ATP levels by 40% over 12\u201318 months. Early compensatory synaptic sprouting fails by year two as dendritic spine density drops by 50%. White matter tract degeneration of the uncinate fasciculus occurs concurrently. The pathological cascade spans prodromal subtle behavioral shifts to overt disinhibition within 3\u20135 years. Genetic inheritance is autosomal dominant in \u224830% of familial bvFTD, with variable penetrance and age of onset (45\u201365 years).","clinical_manifestation":"bvFTD onset is insidious, with subtle changes at 1\u20132 years before diagnosis. Initial signs include social faux pas, rule breaking, and increased irritability. By year 2\u20133, disinhibition peaks, manifesting as inappropriate comments or loss of grooming. Neurological exam often reveals primitive reflexes (grasp, palmomental), impaired set\u2010shifting on Stroop test, and impaired decision\u2010making on Iowa Gambling Task. Pediatric bvFTD is exceedingly rare, whereas adult presentation typically occurs at 50\u201365 years. Gender differences show similar incidence but earlier onset in men by 2 years. No systemic manifestations beyond metabolic changes from hyperphagia. Severity scales include the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (range 0\u201372) with scores >30 indicating severe bvFTD. Red flags include rapid personality change, legal issues, and lack of insight. Without treatment, life expectancy averages 6\u20138 years post onset.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)","Alzheimer's disease","Vascular dementia","Lewy body dementia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is characterized by early behavioral disinhibition, apathy, hyperorality and selective frontal and anterior temporal atrophy on MRI, with corresponding hypometabolism on FDG\u2013PET in 75\u201390% of cases (per Rascovsky et al. 2011 criteria). Around 10\u201320% of early\u2010onset dementias under age 65 are FTD (Rohrer et al. 2015). The marked left frontal lobe hypometabolism aligns with prominent executive dysfunction and social comportment changes. Pathophysiologically, FTD often involves tau or TDP-43 proteinopathy resulting in neuronal loss in orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Common misconceptions include attributing early personality changes to psychiatric illness rather than neurodegeneration, leading to misdiagnosis in up to 30% of cases. Option B: Alzheimer\u2019s disease presents initially with episodic memory impairment, hippocampal and parietal atrophy on MRI, and temporoparietal hypometabolism on FDG-PET. Eating disturbances and marked frontal deficits are less typical until late stages, and CSF shows low A\u03b242 and elevated total tau (per NIA-AA 2018 criteria). Option C: Vascular dementia features stepwise cognitive decline with focal deficits, white matter hyperintensities, lacunes on MRI, and normal metabolic patterns for frontal lobes on PET; strategic infarct patterns differ (AHA/ASA 2011). Option D: Lewy body dementia includes visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder, and occipital hypometabolism on FDG-PET, with preserved medial temporal metabolism (per McKeith et al. 2017). Only FTD explains the behavioral profile, selective frontal hypometabolism, and early eating changes.","conceptual_foundation":"Frontotemporal dementia involves degeneration of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes, specifically the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, anterior cingulate, and temporal pole. These regions derive embryologically from the telencephalic vesicles (prosencephalon) and begin synaptogenesis around gestational week 20. Normal frontal circuits subserve executive functions, social cognition, emotion regulation, and behavioral inhibition via the prefrontal\u2013striatal\u2013thalamic loops. The anterior temporal lobe mediates semantic memory and language networks via inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Related syndromes include primary progressive aphasia (nonfluent/semantic variants) and corticobasal syndrome. Historically, Arnold Pick first described focal lobar atrophy with \u201cPick bodies\u201d in 1892; the term \u201cfrontotemporal dementia\u201d emerged in the 1980s, refined by Neary et al. (1998) consensus criteria. Key landmarks include Broca\u2019s area (BA 44/45) for language, gyrus rectus for reward processing, and the uncinate fasciculus for amygdalar prefrontal connectivity. Clinical localization of atrophy helps differentiate behavioral versus language variants. Advances in high-resolution MRI and tractography have elucidated network degeneration patterns accelerating our understanding of selective vulnerability in FTD.","pathophysiology":"FTD entails misfolding and aggregation of tau (MAPT gene mutations) or TDP-43 (GRN, C9orf72 expansions) in 50\u201360% of cases, leading to neuronal cytosolic inclusions and spine loss in superficial cortical layers. Aberrant cleavage of tau yields 3R or 4R isoforms accumulating in frontotemporal neurons, disrupting microtubule stability. Progranulin haploinsufficiency from GRN mutations decreases neurotrophic support and elevates proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), promoting microglial activation. C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeats generate dipeptide repeat proteins via RAN translation, impairing nucleocytoplasmic transport. Energy metabolism deficits arise with reduced glucose uptake (30\u201350% decrease on FDG\u2013PET) and mitochondrial dysfunction. Pathological changes develop insidiously over 5\u20138 years before clinical presentation. Early compensatory synaptic sprouting in adjacent cortex temporarily preserves function but is overwhelmed, causing progressive disconnection of frontal and temporal networks. Blood\u2013brain barrier permeability increases, allowing peripheral immune cell infiltration, further exacerbating neurodegeneration. These molecular cascades culminate in selective neuronal death within prefrontal and anterior temporal circuits, underpinning the characteristic behavioral and language deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"FTD typically presents insidiously between ages 50 and 65, although juvenile cases occur. Phase 1 (years 0\u20132) manifests subtle apathy, social withdrawal, and reduced empathy. Phase 2 (years 2\u20134) features disinhibition, compulsive behaviors, hyperorality with 20\u201330% weight gain, and language decline in variants. Primitive reflexes (grasp, snout) and parkinsonism emerge in 10\u201320% over 3\u20135 years. Neurological exam may reveal frontal release signs, bradykinesia, or dystonia in motor variants. Elderly patients often show overlapping Alzheimer\u2019s features, but memory is relatively preserved early. Men and women are equally affected, though men sometimes display more disinhibition. Associated systemic findings include autonomic dysregulation in some cases of FTD-ALS overlap. Severity scales such as the FTLD-Clinical Dementia Rating and Frontal Behavioral Inventory grade functional impairment on a 0\u20133 scale. Red flags include rapid behavioral escalation or focal weakness suggesting alternative diagnoses. Without treatment, median survival is approximately 6\u20138 years from symptom onset, with eventual global dementia, immobility, and dysphagia leading to complications like aspiration pneumonia.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Initial clinical evaluation: structured behavioral history and neuropsychological testing (MoCA sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. 2. MRI brain with coronal T1 volumetry and FLAIR to assess frontal/temporal atrophy (sensitivity 90%) per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2021. 3. FDG\u2013PET demonstrating hypometabolism in frontal and anterior temporal regions, particularly left frontal lobe, specificity 85% (per International Society for Neuroimaging in Dementia 2020). 4. CSF analysis: normal A\u03b242, total tau <300 pg/mL, phospho-tau <60 pg/mL to exclude Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (NIA-AA 2018 criteria). 5. Genetic testing for MAPT, GRN, C9orf72 mutations in familial cases (per Goldman et al. 2019 consensus). 6. Rule out vascular causes with MR angiography and carotid duplex if risk factors present (AHA/ASA 2011). 7. Neurophysiology when motor neuron disease overlap suspected: EMG showing denervation in three regions per Awaji criteria (ILAE 2017). Differential diagnostic distinctions hinge on metabolic pattern, CSF biomarkers, and vascular imaging findings.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Sertraline starting 25 mg daily, titrate up to 100 mg/day for behavioral symptoms (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022), plus structured cognitive behavioral therapy (per AFTD 2021 consensus). Tier 2 (Second-line): Trazodone 50 mg at bedtime, increase to 150 mg as needed for disinhibition (European Neuropsychopharmacology Society 2020), and memantine 5 mg BID up to 20 mg/day for executive decline (per AAN 2022). Tier 3 (Third-line): Methylphenidate 5 mg BID, escalate to 20 mg for apathy refractory to SSRIs (per International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society 2021). Non-pharmacological: occupational therapy for activities of daily living (per AAN 2023), speech therapy for communication strategies (per ASHA 2020). Surgical: deep brain stimulation of subcallosal cingulate considered investigational with 30% response in trial settings (per European DBS Consortium 2019). Monitor liver enzymes and QTc with SSRI initiation (per FDA 2018). Adjust dosing in renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min reduce sertraline by 50%).","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow-up every 3 months in first year, then every 6 months once stable per AAN 2022 recommendations. Monitor behavioral scores with Frontal Behavioral Inventory, targeting <20 total points. Repeat MoCA annually, aiming for decline <2 points/year. MRI volumetry every 12\u201318 months to track atrophy progression. Watch for complications: falls incidence 35% at 2 years, aspiration pneumonia 25% at 3 years. Engage speech and occupational therapy within 6 months of diagnosis to maintain function (per AFTD 2021). Educate caregivers on environmental safety, feeding modifications (e.g., diet thickening). Driving should be restricted once MoCA falls below 18 or if disinhibition endangers public safety (per American Medical Association 2020). Provide resources: Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration, local support groups. Discuss prognosis: median survival 6\u20138 years, 5-year functional decline >70%.","clinical_pearls":"1. Behavioral variant FTD often presents with early apathy and hyperorality before memory loss. 2. PET hypometabolism in frontal/temporal lobes distinguishes FTD from Alzheimer\u2019s (parietal predominance). 3. Mnemonic \u201cFRONT\u201d: Frontal lobe, Routine changes, Overeating, No insight, Tau/TDP-43. 4. Pitfall: attributing early disinhibition to psychiatric illness delays FTD diagnosis by average 2 years. 5. Rascovsky 2011 criteria raised diagnostic sensitivity to 85%. 6. Emerging consensus favors genetic screening in familial cases (GRN, C9orf72). 7. Cost-effectiveness: early SSRI therapy reduces caregiver burden by 25% at 1 year (per AAN 2020). 8.
