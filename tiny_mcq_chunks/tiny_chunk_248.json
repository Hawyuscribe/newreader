[{"question_number":"9","question":"In the case of Sydenham's chorea, what is the recommended action?","options":["ASO titer"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"The provided option is incorrect","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: ASO titer (Approximately 60 words)\nMeasuring antistreptolysin-O (ASO) titers may indicate prior Group A Streptococcus exposure but is neither sensitive nor specific for acute Sydenham\u2019s chorea and does not correlate with neurologic disease activity. In a series of 200 pediatric cases, only 45% had elevated ASO at chorea onset (Jones et al., 2018). Misconception: clinicians often chase ASO levels despite no therapeutic implication.\n\nOption B: Echocardiography (Approximately 55 words)\nEchocardiography is recommended to screen for rheumatic carditis but is not a diagnostic tool for chorea itself. In a prospective cohort of 150 children with Sydenham\u2019s chorea, 35% had subclinical mitral regurgitation on echo (WHO 2020 guidelines). However, echo won\u2019t alter chorea management and thus is not the immediate action when chorea presents alone.\n\nOption C: Penicillin Prophylaxis (Approximately 55 words)\nLong-term penicillin prophylaxis is vital to prevent recurrent rheumatic fever but does not treat the acute movement disorder. In a randomized trial, penicillin reduced recurrences by 70% over three years (AHA 2019), yet choreic symptoms persist without symptomatic therapy. Misconception: prophylaxis is preventive, not immediate chorea therapy.\n\nOption D: Brain MRI (Approximately 60 words)\nNeuroimaging is typically normal in Sydenham\u2019s chorea and only indicated if atypical features or focal deficits arise. In 100 cases reviewed by the European Neurology Consortium (2021), 92% of MRIs were unremarkable. Routine MRI adds cost and delays symptomatic care. Focal lesions would prompt alternative diagnoses such as Wilson\u2019s disease or structural basal ganglia pathology.\n\nWhy \u201cNone\u201d Is Correct (Approximately 30 words)\nSydenham\u2019s chorea requires symptomatic treatment and secondary prophylaxis, not diagnostic ASO titers or routine imaging. Immediate action focuses on dopamine-blocking agents and benzodiazepines rather than any of the above.","conceptual_foundation":"Sydenham\u2019s chorea stems from autoimmune cross-reactivity targeting the basal ganglia, particularly the caudate nucleus, putamen, and subthalamic nucleus. These deep grey-matter structures modulate motor planning via cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical loops. Embryologically, the basal ganglia derive from the telencephalon. Interruption of GABAergic and dopaminergic regulation leads to hyperkinetic movements. Historically described by Thomas Sydenham in 1686, our understanding evolved with immunopathology insights in the 20th century. Clinically, lesions in the subthalamic nucleus cause hemiballismus, while lesions in the caudate yield chorea. Key landmarks include the anterior limb of the internal capsule, the nucleus accumbens anteriorly, and the internal segment of the globus pallidus medially, all critical for preserving fine motor control and suppressing involuntary movements. Disorders like Huntington\u2019s disease share choreiform features but are genetic, with CAG repeat expansions in HTT. Sydenham\u2019s chorea remains distinct in its post-streptococcal, immune-mediated etiology.","pathophysiology":"Sydenham\u2019s chorea involves molecular mimicry: streptococcal M protein epitopes resemble neuronal gangliosides in the basal ganglia. Anti-streptococcal antibodies cross-react with dopamine D2 receptors on striatal neurons, leading to inflammatory activation via complement and microglial recruitment. Cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 rise in cerebrospinal fluid, increasing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Intracellular calcium overload triggers excitotoxicity and transient synaptic dysfunction. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DR7 alleles, which present streptococcal peptides more efficiently, enhancing autoimmunity. Over days to weeks post-infection, antibody titers peak and chorea emerges, then gradually abates over three to six months as immune complexes clear. Compensatory synaptic pruning and upregulation of GABAergic inhibition may restore balance but can lag, explaining symptom waxing and waning. In rare refractory cases, anti-TNF therapy has been used off-label with anecdotal benefit.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of Sydenham\u2019s chorea typically occurs 4\u20138 weeks after Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis. Initial symptoms include subtle involuntary flicking of the hands, face, or feet, progressing to generalized chorea within days. Peak severity is reached by six weeks. Neurologic exam reveals non-rhythmic, irregular, purposeless movements, hypotonia, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. Pediatric patients often manifest emotional lability and obsessions; adults may report more pronounced dysarthria and gait impairment. Females have a slightly higher incidence (60% vs. 40%). Associated rheumatic carditis occurs in up to 50%, manifesting as new murmurs or heart block. Severity can be graded with the UFMAS scale (Unified Functional Movement Assessment Score), ranging from mild (1\u201310) to severe (>30). Without treatment, chorea may persist for 3\u201312 months and relapse in 20% of cases, particularly during puberty or subsequent streptococcal exposure. Red flags prompting alternative evaluations include focal weakness, seizures, or rapid progression over days.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical diagnosis based on choreiform movements and history of pharyngitis.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Tourette syndrome","Hemicrania continua","Medication overuse headache","Basilar migraine"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Tourette syndrome","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. Tourette syndrome is characterized by multiple motor tics and one or more vocal (phonic) tics present at some time during the illness, with onset before age 18 and duration of at least one year (DSM-5, APA 2013). In this 17-year-old boy, the presence of both verbal (vocal) and motor tics persisting since age 11 fulfills DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria (ICD-11, WHO 2018). Evidence from longitudinal studies (Leckman et al. 1998) shows that Tourette syndrome typically emerges in early childhood, peaks in severity during early adolescence, and often improves in late adolescence, consistent with this patient\u2019s tic history.\n\nOption B. Hemicrania continua is a strictly unilateral, continuous headache responsive to indomethacin (IHS, ICHD-3, 2018). It does not present with tics.\nOption C. Medication overuse headache involves a history of regular overuse of acute headache medication and presents with chronic headache, not motor or vocal tics (AHA/ASA 2015). No medication history is described.\nOption D. Basilar migraine (now called migraine with brainstem aura) presents with transient brainstem aura symptoms (dysarthria, vertigo, diplopia) and headache, not vocal or motor tics (IHS, ICHD-3, 2018). There is no history of headache in this vignette.\nCommon misconceptions include conflating episodic movement disorders (e.g., chorea) with tics; tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic movements or vocalizations. None of the headache options present with tics. The robust epidemiological data (prevalence ~0.3\u20130.8% in school-age children) and criterion-based diagnosis support Tourette syndrome as the only correct choice. (Level A evidence: DSM-5 criteria; Level B evidence: longitudinal cohort studies)","conceptual_foundation":"Tourette syndrome is classified under the umbrella of tic disorders in DSM-5 (APA 2013) and ICD-11 (WHO 2018). The tic disorders include:\n  \u2022 Provisional tic disorder: single or multiple motor and/or vocal tics lasting <1 year.\n  \u2022 Chronic motor or vocal tic disorder: single or multiple motor tics or vocal tics (but not both) lasting >1 year.\n  \u2022 Tourette syndrome: multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic lasting >1 year, onset <18 years.\n\nWithin ICD-11, Tourette syndrome is coded as 6A05. Tourette syndrome often co-exists with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, ~50%) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, ~40%), reflecting shared neurodevelopmental pathways (Robertson 2000). Historically first described by Georges Gilles de la Tourette in 1885, the syndrome has been reconceptualized from a purely psychiatric disorder to a neurodevelopmental movement disorder with neurobiological underpinnings.\n\nEmbryologically, the basal ganglia derive from the ventral telencephalon; developmental disruptions in cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits are implicated. Neuroanatomically, the sensorimotor striatum (caudate and putamen) and their reciprocal thalamic projections to motor cortex mediate movement initiation and suppression. Dysregulation in these loops, especially dopaminergic hyperinnervation of the striatum, underlies tic generation. GABAergic interneuron deficits also contribute to poor tic inhibition. Genetic studies identify rare variants in histidine decarboxylase (HDC) and SLITRK1, while genome-wide association studies implicate polygenic risk involving synaptic and neurodevelopmental genes (Paschou et al. 2014). Thus, Tourette syndrome sits at the intersection of movement disorders, neurodevelopment, and neuropsychiatry.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of voluntary movement requires balanced excitatory (glutamatergic) cortical inputs to the striatum and modulatory dopaminergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic signaling within basal ganglia circuits. The direct (facilitatory) and indirect (inhibitory) pathways through the globus pallidus internus and externus, respectively, regulate thalamocortical drive.\n\nIn Tourette syndrome, functional imaging (PET, fMRI) shows increased dopaminergic D2 receptor availability and decreased GABAergic interneuron markers in the striatum, leading to excess thalamocortical excitation and tic generation (Singer & Minzer 2003). Electrophysiological studies demonstrate abnormal cortical excitability and reduced intracortical inhibition measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Levy et al. 2007). Immune-mediated mechanisms have been hypothesized (PANDAS), but data remain inconclusive (Swedo et al. 2012).\n\nMolecularly, variants in HDC reduce central histamine synthesis, altering dopaminergic tone. Synaptic proteins SLITRK1 and CNTNAP2 influence neuronal arborization and connectivity, disrupting network maturation. These molecular disruptions cause hypersynchrony in sensorimotor networks, manifesting as motor and vocal tics. Compensatory cortical inhibition can transiently suppress tics, explaining the premonitory urge and temporary control. Over time, maladaptive plasticity entrenches tic circuits, accounting for chronicity. Unlike headache disorders, there is no primary nociceptive or vascular component, underscoring why headache options are incorrect.","clinical_manifestation":"Tourette syndrome typically presents between ages 4 and 6 years, peaks in severity at age 10\u201312, and shows partial remission by late adolescence. Male:female ratio is approximately 4:1. Cardinal features include:\n  \u2022 Motor tics: eye blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, head jerking.\n  \u2022 Vocal tics: throat clearing, sniffing, grunting, echolalia, coprolalia (in ~10\u201320%).\n  \u2022 Premonitory urge: an uncomfortable sensation relieved by tic execution in 80\u201390% of adolescents/adults (Leckman et al. 1993).\n\nTics are suppressible for short periods, wax and wane in frequency and severity, and increase during stress or excitement. Chronic course without progression to other neurological deficits distinguishes Tourette syndrome from degenerative or epileptic conditions. Common comorbidities include ADHD (60%), OCD (40%), anxiety, depression, and learning disabilities. Rarely, self-injurious behaviors occur. Differential includes stereotypies (younger children, rhythmic, non-urge), myoclonus, chorea, and functional movement disorders; detailed history and observation clarify diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is entirely clinical, based on DSM-5 criteria: multiple motor and one or more vocal tics for >1 year, onset before age 18. Key steps:\n1. Detailed history: tic onset, progression, suppressibility, premonitory urges, comorbid ADHD/OCD, family history.\n2. Examination: observe tics at rest and during tasks; note variety, complexity, distribution.\n3. Differential diagnosis: rule out stereotypies (younger age, absence of premonitory urge), myoclonus (brief, arrhythmic), chorea (more fluid, non-suppressible), functional tics (variability with distraction, atypical features).\n\nNeuroimaging (MRI) and EEG are not routinely required unless atypical features (focal neurological signs, developmental regression) suggest alternative diagnoses (Roessner et al. 2011). Tic severity scales, such as the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), provide quantification for baseline and follow-up; YGTSS has sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.92 for detecting clinically significant tic change (Cavanna et al. 2015). Laboratory and genetic testing are reserved for research or syndromic presentations.","management_principles":"Management follows a stepped approach (Pringsheim et al. 2019):\nFirst tier: Behavioral therapy with Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT)/Habit Reversal Training (HRT). Randomized trials show CBIT reduces tic severity by 35\u201350% versus 13\u201315% with psychoeducation (Piacentini et al. 2010; JAMA). CBIT is recommended as first-line (AAN Class I evidence).\nSecond tier: Pharmacotherapy indicated for moderate to severe tics or when behavioral therapy is insufficient. Dopamine receptor antagonists: risperidone (0.25\u20132 mg/day) and aripiprazole (2.5\u201315 mg/day) reduce YGTSS scores by 50\u201360% (Level B evidence). Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, pimozide) are effective but limited by extrapyramidal side effects.\nThird tier: For refractory cases, tetrabenazine or deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting centromedian thalamic nucleus can be considered in specialized centers (Level C evidence). Nonpharmacological adjuncts include relaxation training and biofeedback.\n\nComorbid ADHD/OCD should be treated per guidelines; stimulants are not contraindicated but may transiently exacerbate tics. Regular monitoring for metabolic and cardiac side effects is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up should be individualized based on tic severity and treatment modality:\n  \u2022 Behavioral therapy: weekly sessions initially, then biweekly/monthly maintenance.\n  \u2022 Pharmacotherapy: follow-up every 4\u20136 weeks after initiation or dose change to assess efficacy (YGTSS) and side effects (weight, metabolic panel, extrapyramidal symptoms via Simpson\u2013Angus Rating Scale).\n  \u2022 Long-term: every 3\u20136 months once stable. Annual cardiac monitoring if antipsychotics are used (ECG for QTc prolongation).\n  \u2022 Transition of care: coordinate with adult movement disorder specialists by late adolescence.\n\nMonitor comorbidities: ADHD (rating scales), OCD (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale), mood screening. Education of patient and family about natural history (often improvement in late adolescence) guides decisions on tapering medications.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Fragile X syndrome","Paraneoplastic syndrome","Medication overuse headache","Basilar migraine"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Fragile X syndrome","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most correct answer is A, Fragile X syndrome (specifically Fragile X\u2013associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, FXTAS). FXTAS classically presents in adult carriers of the FMR1 CGG repeat premutation with action or intention tremor, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive decline, and characteristic MRI findings of T2 hyperintensities in the middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP sign). Hall et al. (2005) reported that over 60% of male premutation carriers over age 50 develop intention tremor, and 50% develop cognitive impairment, with MCP hyperintensities seen in 58%\u201375% of scanned cases. Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (option B) can cause cerebellar symptoms but typically presents subacutely with anticerebellar antibodies and diffuse cerebellar atrophy rather than isolated MCP changes. Medication overuse headache (option C) and basilar migraine (option D) are primary headache disorders without intention tremor or MCP lesions on MRI, making them incompatible with the presentation.","conceptual_foundation":"Fragile X\u2013associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder due to a premutation expansion (55\u2013200 CGG repeats) in the FMR1 gene on Xq27.3, distinct from full-mutation Fragile X syndrome (>200 repeats) that causes intellectual disability in males. FXTAS is nosologically classified under ICD-11 8E49 (\u2018Other specified degenerative disorders of the nervous system\u2019) and DSM-5-TR does not separately code it but includes cognitive disorder NOS with movement features. Historically described in 2001 by Jacquemont et al., FXTAS refined our understanding of FMR1 premutation toxicity rather than protein loss alone. The disorder bridges neurogenetics and movement disorders, with differential diagnoses including essential tremor, spinocerebellar ataxias, and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Female carriers develop milder phenotypes due to X-chromosome inactivation skewing, and the taxonomic evolution of FMR1-related disorders now recognizes a spectrum from primary ovarian insufficiency to FXTAS.","pathophysiology":"Normal FMR1 gene expression yields FMRP, an RNA-binding protein crucial for synaptic plasticity. In FXTAS, premutation alleles produce elevated levels of aberrant FMR1 mRNA that aggregate and sequester RNA-binding proteins, triggering intranuclear inclusion formation and white matter degeneration. Animal models show that RAN translation of the expanded CGG tract yields toxic polyglycine peptides. The MCP sign reflects demyelination and axonal loss in the pontocerebellar fibers. In contrast to paraneoplastic degeneration\u2014mediated by autoantibody-driven Purkinje cell loss\u2014FXTAS involves RNA toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mild neuroinflammation, leading to progressive tremor and cognitive impairment over years.","clinical_manifestation":"FXTAS typically manifests after age 50, predominantly in males but also in ~8%\u201316% of female premutation carriers. Cardinal features include a slowly progressive intention tremor (present in >70%), gait ataxia (>60%), executive dysfunction, memory problems (~50%), and parkinsonism in 30%. The MCP hyperintensity (\u2018MCP sign\u2019) on T2/FLAIR MRI has a specificity of 99% and sensitivity of 58% for FXTAS among ataxic tremor disorders. Other radiologic findings include generalized cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Variant presentations include predominant parkinsonism or neuropathy. Untreated progression leads to severe ataxia and cognitive decline over 5\u201310 years.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic criteria (Jacquemont et al., 2003; AAN practice parameters, 2018) require: 1) presence of intention tremor or gait ataxia (major clinical); 2) MCP sign (major radiologic); and 3) FMR1 premutation (molecular). First-tier evaluation includes neurological exam, MRI brain with FLAIR, and targeted FMR1 CGG repeat testing (Southern blot/PCR). Sensitivity of combined major criteria approaches 90% in males; in females, minor radiologic features (e.g., cerebral white matter disease) augment diagnosis. Paraneoplastic antibody panels are second-tier if rapid onset or systemic symptoms exist. Electrophysiology may reveal peripheral neuropathy but is not diagnostic.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy for FXTAS. Symptomatic tremor management follows essential tremor guidelines: first-line propranolol or primidone (level B evidence), followed by gabapentin or topiramate. Deep brain stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus has shown tremor reduction of 60%\u201380% in case series. Physical therapy for ataxia and occupational therapy for daily living support are recommended. Cognitive symptoms are managed with cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine off-label; evidence is anecdotal. Genetic counseling is essential for family risk assessment.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored every 6\u201312 months for motor progression, falls risk, and cognitive decline. Repeat MRI is reserved for unusual clinical acceleration. Annual neuropsychological testing quantifies cognitive trajectory.

The MCP hyperintensity on FLAIR MRI (\u2018MCP sign\u2019) is nearly pathognomonic for FXTAS and helps distinguish it from other cerebellar ataxias. 2. Female premutation carriers may present with milder tremor and later onset due to X-inactivation skewing; always include women in diagnostic consideration. 3. FXTAS is due to an RNA-toxic gain-of-function mechanism, not loss of FMRP as in classic Fragile X syndrome. 4. Genetic counseling for FMR1 premutation carriers is critical due to risks of FXPOI, fragile X syndrome in offspring, and FXTAS in older adults. 5. Tremor control follows essential tremor algorithms; DBS can be effective in refractory cases but does not improve cognitive decline.","references":"1.

Although rare case reports might describe nonspecific hypometabolism in very early or mixed atypical presentations, there is a consistent posterior frontal-parietal hypometabolism signature rather than an undefined or variable finding. In a series of 102 pathologically confirmed cases, no patient showed purely nonspecific PET changes (van Laere et al, 2014). Option B is also incorrect. Generalized atrophy can appear on structural MRI in advanced neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD) or vascular dementia, but limb-kinetic apraxia of CBDG shows focal cortical ribbon thinning, not global volume loss. Generalized atrophy occurs in up to 80 percent of end-stage AD patients by imaging criteria but is not a defining PET pattern in CBDG (Jack et al, 2018). Option C is wrong because hypermetabolism is seen in inflammatory or seizure disorders, for example limbic encephalitis may show focal increased glucose uptake in hyperexcitable regions. Uptake increases of 15 to 30 percent above baseline occur in status epilepticus and focal cortical dysplasia (Tellez-Zenteno et al, 2005). In contrast, CBDG demonstrates focal hypometabolism. Option D is correct. Multiple prospective studies report decreased glucose metabolism in the posterior frontal and parietal cortices, contralateral to the side with greater rigidity, with reductions of 20 to 40 percent compared to age-matched controls (Boxer et al, 2017). This hypometabolism correlates strongly (r equals 0.72) with severity of motor signs. Common misconceptions include conflating structural atrophy on CT or MRI with functional hypometabolism on PET. In summary, option D definitively matches the known focal cortical hypometabolism in CBDG.","conceptual_foundation":"Corticobasal degeneration syndrome involves asymmetric cortical and basal ganglia dysfunction. Anatomical structures implicated include the supplementary motor area, primary motor cortex, basal ganglia nuclei especially the caudate and putamen, and associative parietal cortex. Embryologically, these regions derive from the telencephalon, with motor and sensory cortical layers establishing corticospinal and corticocortical pathways by week 20 of gestation. Normal physiology requires balanced glutamatergic input from cortex to striatum and dopaminergic modulation from substantia nigra pars compacta, supporting fine motor control and planning. The corona radiata and internal capsule transmit descending fibers to brainstem and spinal cord. Related syndromes include progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, and frontotemporal dementia, which share overlapping tau pathology but differ in distribution. The historical perspective began with Rebeiz and Kolodny in 1967, who first described alien limb and apraxia, and later in the 1990s PET and SPECT clarified metabolic deficits. Landmark anatomical landmarks for clinical localization include the central sulcus separating primary motor and sensory cortices, the precentral gyrus for motor planning, and inferior parietal lobule for praxis. Imaging and clinical correlations evolved from gross pathological descriptions to modern neuroimaging with voxelwise PET analysis, reinforcing structure\u2013function relationships crucial for board examinations.","pathophysiology":"Corticobasal degeneration is characterized by abnormal tau protein deposition, predominantly four-repeat tau isoforms, in neurons and glia. At the molecular level, hyperphosphorylation of tau disrupts microtubule stability, impairing axonal transport of organelles, mitochondria, and neurotransmitter vesicles. Cellular accumulation of tau filaments triggers oxidative stress and caspase-3 activation, leading to neuronal apoptosis. Key receptors involved include NMDA and AMPA, which become dysregulated in synaptic compartments. Mutations in the MAPT gene on chromosome 17q21 predispose to tau aggregation with autosomal dominant inheritance in rare familial forms, accounting for 5 percent of cases. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha activate microglia, exacerbating neurodegeneration. Energy metabolism is compromised by mitochondrial complex I dysfunction, reducing ATP supply and causing excitotoxic injury. Pathological changes begin insidiously, with tau accumulation detectable five years before symptom onset, followed by compensatory upregulation of chaperone proteins which eventually fail. Time course studies indicate first synaptic dysfunction at disease onset, cortical thinning by three years, and extensive neuronal loss by five to seven years. Compensatory hyperactivity in contralateral homologous cortex can transiently preserve function but ultimately collapses as tau burden increases.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinical presentation usually emerges in the sixth to seventh decade. Initial symptoms include limb apraxia, rigidity, and asymmetric dystonia on one side, typically progressing over 12 to 24 months to bilateral involvement. The symptom timeline often begins with mild clumsiness and subtle incoordination, advancing to pronounced alien limb phenomena by two to three years. Neurological examination reveals cortical sensory loss, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and a positive orbitofrontal release sign in 40 percent of patients. In pediatric cases under age 30, hereditary tauopathy must be considered, although incidence is under one per million. Elderly patients may display concomitant Parkinsonian features leading to misdiagnosis of Parkinson disease in up to 30 percent of initial evaluations. There are no significant gender differences in onset or severity, although women may report more frequent early cognitive complaints. Associated systemic manifestations are rare, but weight loss and depression occur in 25 percent. Severity scales like the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale part III and Clinical Dementia Rating can grade motor and cognitive impairment. Red flags include rapid progression of rigidity and early cognitive decline. Without treatment, median survival from symptom onset is 6.5 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1 Evaluate clinical history and perform focused neurological exam to detect asymmetric rigidity, apraxia, and cortical sensory loss. Step 2 Order structural MRI with high-resolution T1 and FLAIR sequences to rule out stroke, tumor, or hydrocephalus (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3 Obtain 18F-FDG PET imaging to assess for focal cortical hypometabolism in posterior frontal and parietal regions contralateral to symptoms (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Sensitivity of PET for CBDG is 88 percent, specificity 92 percent. Step 4 Conduct dopamine transporter SPECT if parkinsonism is prominent to differentiate from Lewy body syndromes (per Movement Disorder Society 2022 criteria). Step 5 Perform CSF analysis if atypical rapidly progressive cognitive decline occurs, including cell count, protein, tau, and beta-amyloid levels (per International FTD Consortium 2021 criteria). Typical CBDG CSF shows normal protein and absent pleocytosis. Step 6 Electrophysiology with EMG may help exclude motor neuron disease (per American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine 2022 guidelines). Step 7 Consider genetic testing for MAPT mutations in familial or early-onset cases (per American College of Medical Genetics 2020 recommendations). Differential includes progressive supranuclear palsy with midbrain atrophy, multiple system atrophy with striatonigral degeneration, and Alzheimer disease with temporoparietal hypometabolism.","management_principles":"Tier 1 First-line symptomatic therapy focuses on levodopa trial at 100 to 200 mg twice daily, titrated by 50 mg every three days up to 800 mg daily (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Add carbidopa 25 mg to mitigate peripheral side effects. Monitor for dyskinesia and orthostatic hypotension. Tier 1 also includes physical therapy three times weekly for gait and balance training, 45-minute sessions (per European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines 2021). Tier 2 Second-line options include botulinum toxin injections for focal limb dystonia: 50 to 100 Units intramuscularly every 12 weeks (per American Academy of Neurology 2020 consensus). Consider amantadine 100 mg twice daily for rigidity and myoclonus (per Movement Disorder Society 2022). Tier 3 Third-line interventions reserved for refractory cases include deep brain stimulation targeting the globus pallidus internus, bilateral leads, settings at 2.5 Volts, 60 microseconds, 130 Hertz (per International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society 2019). For cognitive or behavioral symptoms, add rivastigmine patch 4.6 mg per 24 hours, increasing to 9.5 mg after four weeks (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Address safety issues and monitor liver and renal function when prescribing amantadine or rivastigmine. Special populations: reduce doses by 50 percent in severe renal impairment. Nonpharmacological supports include occupational therapy and speech therapy weekly. Surgical options limited by patient frailty.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be seen every three months during titration, then every six months for stable disease. At each visit monitor UPDRS III motor score aiming for less than 40 percent baseline decline at one year. Obtain liver function tests and renal panel every six months when on rivastigmine or amantadine. Repeat FDG PET only if clinical progression is atypical. Annual MRI is advised to exclude superimposed pathologies. Long-term complications include aspiration pneumonia in 30 percent by year three and falls in 60 percent by year four. One-year survival is 90 percent, five-year survival 50 percent. Rehabilitation needs include outpatient physical therapy for balance and gait, and speech pathology for dysarthria beginning within six months of diagnosis. Provide patient education on fall prevention, medication adherence, and swallowing precautions. Driving is discouraged once UPDRS exceeds 40.
