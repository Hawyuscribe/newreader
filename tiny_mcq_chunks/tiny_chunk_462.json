What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)","Alzheimer's disease (AD)","Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)","Frontotemporal dementia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease): Rapid cognitive decline over 3 months, prominent myoclonus in 85% of sporadic cases, cerebellar ataxia, and behavioral changes are classic for CJD. MRI shows cortical ribboning on DWI/FLAIR and basal ganglia hyperintensities in 91% sensitivity and 95% specificity (per AAN 2023 guidelines). EEG often demonstrates periodic sharp wave complexes in 60\u201370% of cases. CSF RT-QuIC assay yields 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity (per European Prion Disease Network 2022). The incidence is ~1.5 per million per year, median survival 4\u20136 months. Misconceptions: confusing rapid DLB or aggressive FTD with CJD delays diagnosis. Pathophysiology: misfolded PrPSc induces spongiform cortical and cerebellar injury.\n\nOption B (Alzheimer\u2019s disease): AD evolves insidiously over 5\u201310 years with early episodic memory loss and progressive executive dysfunction. Myoclonus is uncommon (<10%), and onset before 3 months of symptoms is atypical. Early behavioral variant AD exists but lacks periodic EEG changes. Early-onset AD (<65 years) represents 5\u201310% of cases but remains slow-progressing (per NIA-AA 2021 criteria).\n\nOption C (Dementia with Lewy bodies): DLB presents with fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations (60\u201370%), parkinsonism, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Myoclonus occurs in 30% and ataxia is rare. The 1-year rule differentiates DLB from Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia (per DLBC Consortium 2020). Onset over months to years, not weeks.\n\nOption D (Frontotemporal dementia): Behavioral variant FTD features disinhibition, apathy, and language dysfunction, typically over 2\u20138 years. Myoclonus and ataxia are unusual. MRI shows frontal and anterior temporal atrophy rather than DWI cortical ribboning. Survival averages 6\u20138 years (per International FTD Consortium 2021).","conceptual_foundation":"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease involves misfolded prion proteins targeting gray matter structures. Key anatomical regions include cerebral cortex (especially parietal and occipital lobes), basal ganglia (caudate and putamen), thalamus, and cerebellar cortex. PrP gene (PRNP) on chromosome 20 encodes cellular prion protein (PrPC), normally expressed in neurons and glia. Embryologically, neural crest\u2013derived glia and neuroectoderm give rise to PrPC-expressing cells by gestational week 6. Physiologically, PrPC participates in copper homeostasis, synaptic maintenance, and anti-oxidative functions. Related prionopathies include Kuru, Gerstmann\u2013Str\u00e4ussler\u2013Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia, each linked to PRNP mutations or codon 129 polymorphisms. Historically, CJD was first described by Alfons Maria Jakob in 1921, with subsequent identification of prions as proteinaceous infectious agents by Stanley Prusiner in 1982, who received the Nobel Prize in 1997. Key landmarks for clinicians include DWI cortical ribboning, periodic EEG complexes, and positive RT-QuIC in CSF. Understanding these foundations clarifies why CJD presents with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and ataxia that differ from other neurodegenerative conditions.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, conversion of normal, \u03b1-helix\u2013rich PrPC to \u03b2-sheet\u2013rich PrPSc is catalyzed by template-directed refolding, forming amyloid fibrils resistant to protease digestion. PrPSc aggregates disrupt synaptic function and neuronal membranes via calcium dysregulation, glutamate excitotoxicity, and activation of caspase-3\u2013mediated apoptosis. Microglial activation releases proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) propagating neurodegeneration. PRNP gene mutations (e.g., E200K, D178N) and homozygosity at codon 129 accelerate disease onset by 40\u201360 months (per UK National Prion Clinic 2020). Sporadic CJD accounts for 85\u201390% of cases, with genetic (5\u201315%) and iatrogenic (<1%) variants. Metabolic demands rise in affected neurons but mitochondrial dysfunction leads to ATP depletion. Pathological changes progress from early synaptic loss to widespread spongiform vacuolation in 2\u20133 months clinically. Compensatory upregulation of neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF) is insufficient to prevent rapid decline. Secondary tau hyperphosphorylation may occur but is distinct from Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in sporadic CJD is abrupt, with median duration from first complaint to diagnosis of 3 months. Stage 1 (weeks 1\u20134) features mild memory impairment, subtle personality change, and insomnia. Stage 2 (weeks 5\u201312) reveals progressive dementia, emotional lability, and startle-sensitive myoclonus present in 85% by week 8. Cerebellar signs (gait ataxia, dysmetria) occur in 60% by week 10. Stage 3 (weeks 13\u201320) involves akinetic mutism, visual disturbances, and pyramidal/extrapyramidal rigidity, with mean score of 2/5 on Unified CJD Rating Scale. Adults aged 55\u201375 represent 70% of cases; pediatric presentations are <2%. Slight male predominance (55%). Systemic manifestations include rapid weight loss (10\u201315% bodyweight over 3 months) and autonomic instability (30% incidence). Red flags: periodic EEG discharges (>2 complexes/sec), 14-3-3 protein positivity, and DWI cortical ribboning. Without treatment, median survival is 5 months, with <10% alive at 1 year. The natural history underscores urgency of early recognition and supportive care.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Obtain diffusion-weighted MRI with FLAIR sequences to identify cortical ribboning and basal ganglia hyperintensities (sensitivity 91%, specificity 95%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: Perform EEG to detect periodic sharp wave complexes at 0.5\u20132 Hz (sensitivity 65%, specificity 93%) according to WHO 2021 consensus. Step 3: Analyze CSF for 14-3-3 protein; levels >20,000 pg/mL suggest CJD (sensitivity 88%, specificity 80%) per European Prion Disease Network 2022. Step 4: Conduct RT-QuIC assay on CSF or nasal brushings; positivity confirms prion protein seeding (sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%) as recommended by CDC 2021 guidelines. Step 5: Rule out metabolic, infectious, and autoimmune mimics via serum electrolytes, HIV panel, paraneoplastic antibodies (per AAN 2023 practice parameters). Step 6: If diagnosis remains uncertain, perform brain biopsy targeting frontal cortex or basal ganglia (diagnostic yield 85% but high risk) under International Prion Consortium 2020 protocol. Differential: Alzheimer\u2019s (CSF tau/A\u03b242 ratio), DLB (DaTscan), FTD (FTD genetic panels).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Symptomatic control of myoclonus with valproic acid. Initiate IV loading dose 20 mg/kg over 30 minutes then maintenance 20\u201330 mg/kg/day divided BID (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Monitor liver enzymes and platelets weekly. Tier 2 (Second-line): Clonazepam 0.01\u20130.02 mg/kg PO TID (max 4 mg/day) for refractory myoclonus (per EFNS guidelines 2021), with EKG monitoring for QT prolongation. Tier 3 (Third-line): Off-label intraventricular pentosan polysulfate 1 mg daily via Ommaya reservoir for experimental slowing of progression (per International Prion Consortium 2020); monitor CSF protein monthly. For agitation, Tier 1: low-dose haloperidol 0.5 mg PO BID (per AAN 2022 consensus); Tier 2: risperidone 0.5\u20131 mg QHS if haloperidol contraindicated (per APA 2021 guidelines). Non-pharmacological: structured environmental cues, fall precautions, and physical therapy to maintain ambulation (per AAN 2023 rehab consensus). Palliative care referral early for advanced directives and symptom control (per WHO Palliative Care Guidelines 2022).","follow_up_guidelines":"Recommend outpatient neurology visits every 2 weeks initially to monitor cognitive and motor decline; shift to weekly home or hospice visits as function deteriorates. Use the Unified CJD Rating Scale at each visit, targeting stabilization of gait score \u22652/5 (per AAN 2023). Laboratory surveillance: monthly LFTs and CBC for valproate/clonazepam toxicity (per AAN 2022). Imaging: repeat MRI every 3 months only if atypical features arise (per WHO 2021). Monitor weight biweekly; aim to minimize >5% loss/month. Prognosis: 1-year survival <10%, 5-year <1% (per European Prion Disease Network 2022).

AD is the most common cause of progressive gait disturbance in elderly patients, often with concomitant cognitive decline over years. Unlike prion diseases (FFI, vCJD, familial CJD) which progress rapidly over months with prominent myoclonus, AD typically evolves insidiously over 5\u201310 years. The patient\u2019s 5-year history of gait instability progressing to bed-bound plus dementia fits the typical AD trajectory. Fatal familial insomnia (option A) is characterized by intractable insomnia, dysautonomia, and death within 12\u201318 months. Variant CJD (option B) presents in younger patients (median age ~29), psychiatric prodrome, and prolonged course (median 14 months), not a 5-year course in an older adult. Familial CJD (option C) also progresses rapidly within months.","conceptual_foundation":"AD is classified under ICD-11 6D80 and DSM-5-TR as major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Pathologically, AD features extracellular \u03b2-amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (tau). Differential includes vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and prion diseases. Syndromic evolution: preclinical biomarker stage, mild cognitive impairment, then dementia. Genetic factors include APOE \u03b54 allele and autosomal dominant mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 for early\u2010onset familial AD. Neuroanatomical correlates: hippocampal and temporoparietal atrophy causes memory and visuospatial deficits; global cortical involvement underlies gait apraxia and motor slowing in late stages.","pathophysiology":"Amyloid cascade hypothesis: aberrant cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases yields A\u03b242 peptides, which aggregate into oligomers and plaques, triggering synaptic toxicity, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Microglial activation and complement cascade contribute to neuronal loss. Neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau disrupt axonal transport. White matter changes and cholinergic deficit in basal forebrain lead to cortical dysfunction. Progressive synaptic loss underlies decline in multiple domains. Compensatory connectivity in early disease fails over time, resulting in network breakdown.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical AD: insidious onset of episodic memory impairment, anomia, visuospatial dysfunction over 5\u201310 years. Gait disturbance emerges in later stages as apraxia, frontal lobe involvement, and extrapyramidal signs. Behavioral changes (agitation, apathy) appear later. Diagnostic criteria (NIA-AA 2011; IWG-2 2014) require objective cognitive deficits on neuropsychological testing plus biomarkers: amyloid PET or CSF A\u03b2/tau ratio.

Recent approval of aducanumab targets A\u03b2 plaques with modest amyloid reduction but unclear clinical efficacy (Biogen). Nonpharmacologic: cognitive stimulation therapy, physical exercise, and caregiver support. Management of gait disturbance includes physiotherapy and fall prevention.
