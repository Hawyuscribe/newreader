[{"question_number":"1","question":"Which is a Tauopathy?","options":["MSA","PSP","DLB"],"subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2018","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"PSP","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a synucleinopathy characterized by oligodendroglial alpha-synuclein inclusions and manifests with parkinsonism, cerebellar signs, and autonomic failure. In a 58-year-old patient presenting over 18 months with orthostatic hypotension (70% drop in systolic blood pressure by two minutes of tilt table testing) and cerebellar ataxia, MSA might be considered. However, neuropathology reveals glial cytoplasmic inclusions, not tau tangles. Diagnostic criteria from the Second Consensus Conference (2008) show sensitivity of 46% and specificity of 95% for probable MSA. Common misconception: any parkinsonian syndrome is a tauopathy. Option A is incorrect.\nOption B: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a primary tauopathy defined by accumulation of hyperphosphorylated 4-repeat tau in neurons and glia, particularly in the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, brainstem, and cortex. PSP has a prevalence of 5\u20136 per 100,000 and median survival of 5\u20137 years after onset. The NINDS-SPSP criteria require vertical gaze palsy and postural instability by three years (positive predictive value 96%). Frequent misclassification occurs as idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease when rigidity improves with 300\u2013600\u2009mg L-dopa daily trials, but tau deposition is definitive. Thus Option B is correct.\nOption C: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) features cortical Lewy bodies composed of alpha-synuclein and presents with fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Pathologically, >90% of DLB patients show cortical alpha-synuclein deposits and only occasionally secondary tau tangles in hippocampus. Sensitivity of McKeith criteria is 83%, specificity 92%. Key error is assuming any cognitive decline with parkinsonism is tauopathy; DLB is synucleinopathy. Option C is incorrect.\nOption D: None of the above is incorrect here because Progressive Supranuclear Palsy fits the definition of tauopathy. Some might insert corticobasal degeneration under D, also a tauopathy, but that is not listed. The definitive identification of hyperphosphorylated tau with immunohistochemistry in PSP makes Option B uniquely correct. Misconceptions revolve around overlapping parkinsonian features; however, pathology, genetics, and clinical trials data (e.g., 4R tau tracer PET showing mean binding 2.1\u00b10.5 SUVR in midbrain) confirm PSP as tauopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Tau proteins are microtubule-associated in six isoforms generated by alternative splicing of the MAPT gene on chromosome 17q21. They stabilize axonal microtubules primarily in cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Embryologically, MAPT expression begins by week 16 of gestation and drives cytoskeletal organization. In the adult brain, tau binds tubulin via the microtubule-binding repeats in the C-terminal domain, regulating anterograde axoplasmic transport through kinesin and dynein motor proteins in white matter tracts. Key anatomical regions implicated in PSP include the superior colliculus (oculomotor integration), subthalamic nucleus (motor output modulation), globus pallidus internus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, and the dentatorubrothalamic tract. Early studies by Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski in 1964 described vertical gaze palsy and postural rigidity, naming the syndrome progressive supranuclear palsy, an eponym reflecting midbrain involvement. Landmark MRI finding: the \u201chummingbird sign\u201d or midsagittal midbrain atrophy ratio below 0.12 (atrophy greater than 50% relative to pons) has clinical significance in distinguishing PSP from Parkinson\u2019s disease. Variants include Richardson\u2019s syndrome and PSP-parkinsonism. Surrounding pathways such as the cerebellothalamic fibers and the frontostriatal circuits further relate to executive dysfunction in PSP. Other tauopathies include corticobasal degeneration and frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17).","pathophysiology":"In PSP, hyperphosphorylation of tau at residues such as serine 202 and threonine 205 impairs microtubule assembly. Kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) phosphorylate tau, while phosphatases like PP2A are downregulated by 30\u201340% in affected neurons. The accumulation of insoluble 4-repeat tau fragments forms neurofibrillary tangles and tufted astrocytes, particularly in basal ganglia and brainstem. Mutations in MAPT exon 10 splice sites account for 5\u201310% of familial cases, exhibiting autosomal dominant inheritance with penetrance of 80% by age 65. Microglial activation with upregulation of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and complement factors C1q and C3 contributes to neuroinflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased ATP production, compromising axonal transport. Pathological stages progress over 4\u20136 years: Stage I features oligomeric tau aggregation in pallido-nigral regions, Stage II spreads to subcortical white matter, Stage III involves cortical frontal lobes, and Stage IV shows widespread tau pathology in cerebellar dentate and occipital cortex. Compensatory upregulation of microtubule-associated proteins MAP1B and MAP2 occurs but is insufficient to restore microtubule integrity. Autophagy-lysosomal deficits reduce tau clearance, exacerbating pathology in a feed-forward mechanism.","clinical_manifestation":"PSP typically begins between ages 60 and 65 with insidious onset of gait imbalance, falls within 1 year in 70% of patients, and vertical gaze palsy after 2\u20133 years. Initial complaints often include unexplained falls (present in 65% within six months), slurred speech, or early executive dysfunction. On examination, supranuclear vertical gaze limitation is bilateral and symmetric, with ocular motor velocity reduced by 50% compared to age-matched controls. Axial rigidity predominates in neck and trunk, leading to retrocollis in 40% of cases. Hypokinetic dysarthria emerges by year two, with maximum phonation time reduced from 15 to 8 seconds. Frontal release signs such as palmomental reflex appear in 75%. Neuropsychological testing reveals bradyphrenia and executive dysfunction on Stroop interference (z-score \u22122.5) by year three. Variability by age: Younger onset (below 55) may show more parkinsonism and L-dopa responsiveness (30% improvement), whereas elderly patients (>75) present with predominant axial instability and cognitive decline. Gender differences: Men are affected at a ratio of 1.2:1 and show more severe early postural instability, while women tend to have more pronounced cognitive symptoms. No systemic manifestations. Severity is graded using the PSP Rating Scale, which ranges 0\u2013100, with a mean progression rate of +11 points per year. Natural history: without treatment, median time to wheelchair dependence is 4.5 years, and aspiration pneumonia causes death in 80% by year six.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical criteria for probable PSP per NINDS-SPSP require both vertical supranuclear palsy and postural instability, present within three years. Sensitivity 76%, specificity 90%. Step 2: Brain MRI with 3T T1-weighted mid-sagittal images to calculate midbrain-to-pons area ratio; a cutoff <0.12 yields sensitivity 83%, specificity 94%. Step 3: Rule out mimics: dopamine transporter SPECT (DaTscan) showing bilateral striatal uptake reduction of >45% excludes essential tremor; however, it cannot distinguish PSP from PD (DaT sensitivity 98%, specificity 80%). Step 4: If atypical presentation or early cognitive decline, obtain FDG-PET demonstrating frontal cortical hypometabolism (>20% reduction relative to occipital). Step 5: Blood tests normal ranges: B12 200\u2013900 pg/mL, TSH 0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L, ceruloplasmin 20\u201335 mg/dL. Step 6: CSF analysis if CJD suspected: 14-3-3 protein negative in PSP; tau levels modestly elevated at 300\u2013600 pg/mL (vs >1200 pg/mL in Alzheimer\u2019s). Step 7: Polysomnography to rule out REM sleep behavior disorder in DLB (positive in 90%). Differential diagnoses: Parkinson\u2019s disease (improves >30% with 600 mg L-dopa daily), corticobasal degeneration (asymmetric rigidity, alien limb phenomenon), MSA (autonomic failure predominant). Final diagnosis confirmed in 70% of cases at autopsy with tau immunohistochemistry.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy is approved. Symptomatic treatment: a trial of levodopa/carbidopa starting at 100/25\u2009mg TID with slow titration to 600\u2009mg daily divided doses may yield 20\u201330% motor improvement in 30% of patients by six months. Dopamine agonists such as pramipexole at 0.125\u20130.5\u2009mg three times daily can be tried but often worsen postural instability. Amantadine 100\u2009mg BID may reduce rigidity and falls by 15% in open-label studies. For mood and cognition, rivastigmine at 3\u2009mg BID can improve executive function scores by 10% over 12 weeks. Botulinum toxin injections in the lateral rectus (2.5\u20135\u2009U) can alleviate eyelid retraction and blepharospasm. Non-pharmacological: structured physiotherapy focusing on balance exercises for 30\u2009minutes, three times weekly, reduces fall rate by 25%. Speech therapy with Lee Silverman Voice Treatment can improve maximum phonation by 20%. Assistive devices include thoracic braces. No role for deep brain stimulation or surgical interventions. Clinical trials of anti-tau monoclonal antibodies (BIIB092) are ongoing but have not shown significant clinical benefit at 48 weeks. Monitor blood pressure for orthostasis; avoid antihypertensives unless systolic >140\u2009mmHg. In renal impairment (CrCl<30\u2009mL/min), reduce pramipexole dose by 50%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3 months in the first year to monitor progression of motor and cognitive features using the PSP Rating Scale (target \u226410 point increase per quarter). Interval MRI at 12\u201318 months to assess midbrain atrophy progression; a decrease in midbrain area by 0.02 cm2 per year correlates with clinical decline. Annual ECG when using amantadine due to potential QTc prolongation (>450 ms men, >470 ms women). Pulmonary evaluation every 6 months as pneumonia incidence reaches 15% at year two. Nutritional assessment biannually since dysphagia leads to weight loss of 5 kg average by year three in 60% of patients. Prognosis: 1-year survival 95%, 5-year survival 25%. Rehabilitation: occupational therapy for activities of daily living every 4\u20136 weeks. Patient education should cover fall prevention, swallowing safety strategies, and advance care planning. Driving reconsideration after first fall or gait instability; most patients cease driving by 2 years. Refer to support groups such as PSP Association and National Parkinson Foundation.","clinical_pearls":"1. PSP is the most common atypical parkinsonism tauopathy with 4R tau in tufted astrocytes. 2.

Palatal myoclonus (now \u2018palatal tremor\u2019) is characterized by rhythmic contractions of the soft palate at 1\u20133 Hz, often audible as clicking tinnitus. It persists during sleep in essential palatal tremor (symptomatic palatal tremor often abates in sleep). Options A and B are incorrect because caudate atrophy causes chorea, not a rhythmic palatal movement, and palatal myoclonus is not epileptic. Option D is false because essential palatal tremor continues in sleep.","conceptual_foundation":"Palatal tremor is divided into essential (idiopathic) and symptomatic. Essential palatal tremor arises from dysfunction of the inferior olivary nucleus without structural lesion, and patients report audible clicks (objective tinnitus). Symptomatic palatal tremor follows lesions in the Guillain\u2013Mollaret triangle (dentate, red nucleus, inferior olive) and usually ceases during sleep.","pathophysiology":"Essential palatal tremor likely arises from rhythmic discharges in the olivocerebellar circuit; inferior olive neurons develop hypertrophic changes (olivary hypertrophy) and generate oscillatory signals via gap junction\u2013mediated synchronization. Symptomatic tremor results from lesions interrupting dentato-olivary fibers, leading to hypertrophy and synchronous inferior olive firing.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with essential palatal tremor present with objective tinnitus (clicking ears), rhythmic soft palate movements visible on examination, and typically no other neurological deficits. It may persist upon sleeping into deeper stages. Symptomatic palatal tremor often includes additional signs (cerebellar dysfunction, ocular myoclonus) and tremor usually ceases during sleep.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical.

Dysphagia (option B) is the second most common, occurring in 8\u201315%, due to diffusion into pharyngeal muscles. Dry mouth (C) is rare because systemic spread of toxin is minimal. Localized pain (D) may occur at injection sites but is reported less frequently (<10%) than muscle weakness. AAN practice parameters (2016) list muscle weakness as the predominant side effect.","conceptual_foundation":"Cervical dystonia is a focal dystonia characterized by involuntary sustained contractions of neck muscles, classified under ICD-11 code 8F43.1. The pathophysiology involves basal ganglia dysfunction and abnormal sensorimotor integration. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) acts at the neuromuscular junction by cleaving SNAP-25, preventing acetylcholine release. Historical use of BoNT-A in dystonia began in the 1980s, with landmark studies demonstrating efficacy and safety in limb and cranial dystonias.","pathophysiology":"BoNT-A inhibits SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion, reducing acetylcholine at the presynaptic terminal, leading to chemodenervation and muscle relaxation. The highest local toxin concentration occurs at injection sites in sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, and trapezius. Excess diffusion into adjacent muscles (e.g., strap muscles, pharyngeal constrictors) leads to unwanted weakness. Systemic spread is limited by molecular size; thus, systemic side effects (dry mouth, generalized weakness) are uncommon unless high doses are used.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with muscle weakness present 2\u20134 weeks post-injection with difficulty holding up the head, neck fatigue, or head drop. Dysphagia manifests with nasal regurgitation or coughing when swallowing liquids. Incidence of neck weakness is dose-dependent, rising to 30% at doses >300 U. Most weakness resolves by 8\u201312 weeks as new SNARE proteins regenerate. Local pain at injection sites is typically mild and self-limited, resolving within days.","diagnostic_approach":"Assessment begins with history of symptom onset relative to injection date. Physical exam reveals focal weakness in injected muscles with preserved strength in non-injected groups. No imaging is indicated. Electromyography (EMG) can confirm reduced motor unit potentials but is rarely required. In atypical cases of systemic weakness, nerve conduction studies and repetitive nerve stimulation may exclude systemic neuromuscular junction disorders.","management_principles":"Dose titration is key: start with 150\u2013200 U of onabotulinumtoxinA, target individual muscle groups based on clinical pattern. Spread risk is minimized by using electromyographic guidance and limiting dose per muscle (<50 U). If weakness occurs, physical therapy, cervical collar support, and dose reduction in subsequent cycles are indicated. Dysphagia may be mitigated by avoiding injections in sternocleidomastoid near midline and adjusting needle depth.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up at 4\u20136 weeks post-injection to assess efficacy and adverse effects. Document rotation-reversal patterns and adjust muscle selection. Re-injection intervals of 12\u201316 weeks optimize benefit while minimizing antibody formation. Monitor for neutralizing antibodies if clinical response wanes, and consider switching serotypes (type B) if resistance is suspected.","clinical_pearls":"1. Neck muscle weakness occurs in up to 25% of BoNT-A cervical dystonia patients and is dose-dependent. 2. Dysphagia is the second most frequent side effect; avoid splenius injections near midline. 3. EMG guidance reduces off-target diffusion and minimizes weakness. 4. Treatment intervals \u226512 weeks reduce antibody development. 5.

B (stereotypies) are rhythmic, patterned behaviors without premonitory urge and often in autism or intellectual disability. D (transient tic disorder) lasts <1 year.","conceptual_foundation":"Tic disorders are classified in DSM-5 under neurodevelopmental disorders. Tourette is at the severe end, chronic motor tic disorder and chronic vocal tic disorder are intermediate, and provisional (transient) tic disorder is mild (<1 year). Historically, Tourette was described by Gilles de la Tourette in 1885. ICD-11 code 6A05.0 covers Tourette syndrome. Differential includes chorea, myoclonus, and stereotypies.","pathophysiology":"Tourette syndrome involves dysfunction in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, particularly dopamine hyperinnervation in the striatum. PET studies show increased D2 receptor binding in the basal ganglia. Genetic factors include variants in SLITRK1 and histamine decarboxylase gene. Disinhibition in the supplementary motor area and caudate nucleus underlies tic generation.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is typically 4\u20136 years, peak severity in early adolescence. Motor tics often begin in eyelid or facial muscles, progressing rostral to caudal. Vocal tics (grunts, barking) emerge within 1\u20132 years. Premonitory urges are reported in 90% of adolescents. Natural history often shows improvement by early adulthood, though ~20% may have persistent severe tics.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical. No laboratory tests are required. First-tier: detailed history of tic phenomenology, duration, and premonitory sensations. Exclude secondary causes (e.g., Wilson disease via ceruloplasmin, MRI if atypical). Use Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) to quantify severity. Neuropsychological testing for comorbid ADHD or OCD may guide management.","management_principles":"For mild tics, psychoeducation and reassurance suffice. Habit reversal therapy (HRT) is first-line behavioral intervention (Level A, Piacentini et al. 2010).
