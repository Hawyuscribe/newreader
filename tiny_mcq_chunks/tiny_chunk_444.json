[{"question_number":"2","question":"A patient presents with rigidity, bradykinesia, and hallucinations with no response to levodopa. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct because Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) characteristically presents with the triad of parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia), visual hallucinations, and cognitive fluctuations, and demonstrates a poor or limited response to levodopa. No other options were provided. This combination of motor and neuropsychiatric features with levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism distinguishes DLB from idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced parkinsonism, and other neurodegenerative conditions.","conceptual_foundation":"Dementia with Lewy Bodies is classified among neurodegenerative dementias in ICD-11 under alpha-synucleinopathies. It shares pathology with Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia (PDD) but is differentiated by the temporal onset of dementia relative to motor symptoms: in DLB, cognitive decline precedes or occurs within 1 year of parkinsonism. Differential diagnoses include Alzheimer\u2019s disease (prominent memory impairment before motor signs), PDD (parkinsonism precedes dementia by over 1 year), vascular dementia (stepwise decline, imaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease), and drug-induced psychosis. The concept of alpha-synuclein aggregation leading to Lewy bodies in cortical and subcortical neurons was first described by Lewy in 1912 and refined with modern immunohistochemistry.","pathophysiology":"DLB is marked by widespread cortical and subcortical deposition of misfolded alpha-synuclein forming Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. These aggregates disrupt synaptic function and neuronal integrity, leading to cholinergic deficits in the nucleus basalis of Meynert and dopaminergic deficits in the substantia nigra. Loss of cholinergic neurons underlies visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations, while nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss causes parkinsonism. Neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction further exacerbate neuronal loss, and cortical involvement distinguishes DLB from pure Parkinson\u2019s disease.","clinical_manifestation":"DLB typically presents in patients aged 60\u201380 years with insidious onset of visual hallucinations (often well formed and detailed), fluctuating cognition (confusion episodes), parkinsonian motor signs (rigidity, bradykinesia), REM sleep behavior disorder (acting out dreams), and autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence). Memory impairment may be less pronounced early compared to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The course is progressive with average survival of 5\u20138 years from diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on the Fourth Consensus Report of the DLB Consortium (2017): core features include fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Supportive features include severe neuroleptic sensitivity, low occipital uptake on FP-CIT SPECT or reduced metabolic activity on FDG-PET. MRI may be normal or show mild cortical atrophy. No definitive biomarker exists in routine use.","management_principles":"Management is multidisciplinary. Rivastigmine (cholinesterase inhibitor) has the strongest evidence (class I trials) for improving cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Levodopa can be trialed for motor symptoms but often exacerbates hallucinations; start at low doses (e.g., 100 mg/day) and titrate slowly. Avoid typical antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol) due to severe sensitivity; quetiapine or clozapine at low doses may be used for psychosis. Nonpharmacologic interventions include sleep hygiene for REM sleep behavior disorder and physical therapy for parkinsonism.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up every 3\u20136 months should assess cognition (e.g., MoCA), motor function (e.g., UPDRS-III), neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., NPI), and activities of daily living. Monitor for orthostatic hypotension, falls, and medication side effects. Adjust cholinesterase inhibitors and dopaminergic therapies based on tolerance and efficacy. Engage caregivers in education about safety and prognosis.","clinical_pearls":"1. Visual hallucinations early in dementia strongly suggest DLB vs Alzheimer\u2019s disease. 2. Poor levodopa response in the presence of parkinsonism points away from idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. 3. REM sleep behavior disorder is a supportive diagnostic feature. 4. DLB patients are highly sensitive to antipsychotics; use atypical agents with caution. 5. Occipital hypometabolism on FDG-PET supports the diagnosis.","references":"1.

Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy produces lesions in the mammillary bodies, medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, and hippocampal formation\u2014critical nodes for episodic memory consolidation. Sechi and Serra (2007) demonstrated that patients with thiamine deficiency exhibit profound anterograde amnesia for personal events, while retaining immediate recall over seconds and procedural skills. Option A (Immediate memory) is incorrect because working memory, which holds information over seconds, relies on cortical circuits largely spared in diencephalic amnesia. Option C (Procedural memory) is mediated by basal ganglia\u2013cerebellar loops and remains intact; mirror\u2010tracing tasks are performed normally by patients with Korsakoff syndrome (Kopelman, 1995). A common misconception is equating global memory loss with semantic memory impairment; in fact, verbal semantic knowledge often remains relatively preserved compared to episodic recall in Wernicke\u2010Korsakoff patients. Thus, episodic memory impairment is the hallmark cognitive deficit in Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Memory systems are categorized into short\u2010term (working) and long\u2010term stores. Long\u2010term memory divides into explicit (declarative) and implicit (nondeclarative) domains. Explicit memory includes episodic (personal events with temporal\u2010spatial context) and semantic (facts and concepts) subtypes. Implicit memory encompasses procedural skills, priming, and classical conditioning. In ICD\u201011, Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy is classified under metabolic encephalopathies (EB71.0). Differential diagnoses for acute amnestic states include transient global amnesia, limbic encephalitis, and early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Historically, Wernicke (1881) described ocular motor signs and confusion in thiamine deficiency, while Korsakoff (1889) highlighted persistent amnesia and confabulation. Embryologically, the diencephalon arises from the caudal prosencephalon; selective vulnerability of the mammillary bodies and thalamic nuclei reflects high metabolic demands during fetal development. Neuroanatomically, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons project via fornix to mammillary bodies, which relay through the mammillothalamic tract to anterior and medial dorsal thalamic nuclei, then to cingulate cortex\u2014critical circuitry for episodic encoding. This foundation underpins the clinical pattern of episodic memory loss in Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy.","pathophysiology":"Thiamine is an essential cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, \u03b1\u2010ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway. Deficiency leads to impaired oxidative phosphorylation, decreased ATP production, accumulation of lactate, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Regions with high metabolic rates\u2014mammillary bodies, medial dorsal and anterior thalamic nuclei, periaqueductal gray matter, and hippocampus\u2014are selectively injured. Neuronal death in these structures disrupts long\u2010term potentiation mechanisms underpinning episodic memory. Cytotoxic edema and petechial hemorrhages occur acutely, whereas chronic stages demonstrate gliosis and atrophy. Procedural memory circuits in basal ganglia and cerebellum, which rely less on thiamine\u2010dependent metabolism, remain functionally intact. The temporal progression begins with reversible metabolic dysfunction; without thiamine replacement, irreversible neuronal loss leads to the persistent amnestic syndrome characteristic of Korsakoff\u2019s psychosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy presents with the classical triad: encephalopathy (confusion, apathy), ocular motor disturbances (nystagmus, sixth\u2010nerve palsy), and gait ataxia. Memory impairment is dominated by anterograde episodic amnesia\u2014patients cannot form new event memories. Retrograde amnesia may affect recent memories more than remote ones, demonstrating a temporal gradient. Procedural skills (e.g., mirror tracing) and immediate recall over seconds are preserved. Confabulation is common in chronic Korsakoff syndrome but less frequent in the acute phase. Onset typically spans days to weeks in malnourished or alcoholic individuals. Prodromal signs include anorexia, peripheral neuropathy, and emotional lability. Without treatment, up to 80% progress to Korsakoff syndrome with severe, persistent episodic memory deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by neuroimaging and laboratory findings. High suspicion in at\u2010risk patients (chronic alcoholism, malnutrition) is essential. Neurologic exam focuses on ocular signs, ataxia, and confusional state. Formal neuropsychological testing reveals impaired episodic recall with preserved working and procedural memory. MRI brain (FLAIR sequences) shows symmetric hyperintensities in mammillary bodies, medial thalamus, periaqueductal gray, and tectal plate in approximately 50\u201360% of acute cases; sensitivity ~53% and specificity ~93% (Zuccoli et al, 2009). Low erythrocyte transketolase activity or direct thiamine level measurement can support diagnosis but are not required before empiric therapy. Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, and other metabolic or toxic encephalopathies. No single test is definitive; empiric treatment should not be delayed for confirmatory studies.","management_principles":"Immediate parenteral thiamine is the cornerstone of therapy. Guidelines recommend 500 mg thiamine IV three times daily for two to three days, followed by 250 mg IV or IM daily for five days or until clinical improvement (NICE NG42, 2017). Oral thiamine is insufficient in acute settings. Intravenous magnesium should be co\u2010administered if deficiency is suspected. Supportive care includes correction of electrolyte imbalances, management of alcohol withdrawal, and nutritional rehabilitation. There is no proven pharmacologic treatment to reverse chronic memory loss; cognitive rehabilitation and compensatory strategies can help adapt to residual deficits. Prophylactic thiamine supplementation is indicated for all high\u2010risk individuals to prevent progression to Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post\u2010acute care requires multidisciplinary follow\u2010up. Neurologic and neuropsychological assessments at one, three, and six months evaluate cognitive recovery, focusing on episodic memory using standardized tools like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Routine MRI follow\u2010up is not mandatory unless atypical features arise. Long\u2010term thiamine supplementation and nutritional monitoring are essential. Alcohol cessation support reduces risk of recurrent deficiency. Prognosis correlates with the rapidity of treatment initiation; earlier thiamine replacement improves ocular and gait signs, but memory deficits may remain permanent. Engage occupational therapy for memory aids and community services for psychosocial support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Episodic memory loss (anterograde amnesia) is the hallmark of Wernicke\u2010Korsakoff amnesia, distinguishing it from early Alzheimer\u2019s semantic deficits. 2. Immediate recall over seconds and procedural learning (e.g., mirror\u2010tracing) remain intact, reflecting preserved cortical and basal ganglia circuits. 3. MRI FLAIR hyperintensities in mammillary bodies and medial thalamus, though present in only about half of cases, have high specificity. 4. Always administer high\u2010dose parenteral thiamine before any glucose infusion to avoid precipitating acute Wernicke\u2019s. 5. Without prompt treatment, up to 80% of acute Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy progresses to chronic Korsakoff syndrome with irreversible episodic memory loss.","references":["1. Sechi G, Serra A.

However, MRI in NPH shows ventriculomegaly out of proportion to cortical atrophy, periventricular CSF flow voids, and rounded frontal horns, rather than extensive confluent white matter hyperintensities. In contrast, Binswanger\u2019s disease demonstrates diffuse periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas grade 2\u20133) with lacunar infarcts and no disproportionate ventricle enlargement. Thus, option B is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Binswanger\u2019s disease (subcortical leukoencephalopathy) is a form of vascular dementia caused by chronic small vessel ischemic damage to deep white matter. It fits within ICD-11 code 6D83.0 (vascular dementia, subcortical type). Historically described in 1894 by Otto Binswanger, this condition manifests predominantly with executive dysfunction, psychomotor slowing, gait apraxia, and urinary disturbance. Differential diagnoses include NPH, progressive supranuclear palsy, and demyelinating leukoencephalopathies. Small penetrating arterioles undergo lipohyalinosis and fibrinoid necrosis due to longstanding hypertension and diabetes, leading to perivascular demyelination and gliosis. The deep white matter tracts\u2014corticospinal, frontostriatal, and corticobulbar pathways\u2014are particularly vulnerable, explaining the gait and bladder control symptoms. The disease\u2019s progression correlates with worsening MRI white matter lesion burden and number of lacunes.","pathophysiology":"Normal white matter conduction relies on intact myelinated fibers and adequate perfusion from penetrating arterioles. In Binswanger\u2019s disease, hypertension and age-related arteriolosclerosis cause thickening of vessel walls, narrowing lumina, and impaired autoregulation. Chronic hypoperfusion triggers oligodendrocyte apoptosis, loss of myelin basic protein, and interstitial edema. Microglial activation and low\u2010grade inflammation perpetuate blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. Resultant demyelination and axonal loss interrupt frontosubcortical circuits governing motor planning, urinary sphincter control, and executive cognitive functions. By contrast, NPH involves altered CSF dynamics leading to ventricular enlargement that stretches periventricular fibers but spares widespread deep white matter integrity. Thus, the molecular cascade in Binswanger\u2019s disease\u2014arteriolar stenosis, ischemia, demyelination\u2014is distinct from the CSF hydrodynamic disruption in NPH.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present after age 60 with insidious onset of psychomotor slowing, executive dysfunction (impaired planning, set-shifting), gait apraxia (magnetic, shuffling gait), and urinary urgency progressing to incontinence. Memory impairment is often milder early on compared to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The classic triad\u2014gait disturbance, cognitive decline, urinary dysfunction\u2014may be mistaken for NPH, but in Binswanger\u2019s, gait is more frontally apraxic than the broad-based gait of NPH. Neurological examination reveals frontal release signs, slowed rapid alternating movements, and hyperreflexia in advanced disease. The natural history is slowly progressive over years, with stepwise declines correlating with new lacunar infarcts.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis rests on clinical assessment and brain MRI. First-line evaluation includes thorough cognitive testing (e.g., MoCA demonstrating executive deficits) and gait analysis. MRI should be acquired with T2/FLAIR sequences to visualize periventricular hyperintensities (Fazekas scale grade \u22652), lacunes in basal ganglia or thalamus, and microbleeds on susceptibility\u2010weighted imaging. CSF studies and neurophysiology are reserved to exclude inflammatory or demyelinating mimics. Neuropsychological profiling supports subcortical pattern with slowed processing speed and executive dysfunction exceeding memory loss. NPH workup includes CSF tap test and intrathecal infusion study, which are negative in Binswanger\u2019s. PET/SPECT may show decreased frontal perfusion but are not routinely required.","management_principles":"No disease\u2010modifying therapies exist; management focuses on vascular risk factor control (target BP <130/80 mm Hg, LDL <70 mg/dL, glycemic control). Antiplatelet agents (aspirin 75\u2013100 mg daily) reduce risk of new lacunes. Statin therapy per guidelines for secondary prevention. Structured cognitive rehabilitation and physiotherapy improve gait and executive function. Urinary symptoms managed with timed voiding and anticholinergics (e.g., oxybutynin) while monitoring for cognitive side effects. Emerging therapies targeting cerebral small vessel disease (e.g., cilostazol) remain investigational.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical progression every 6\u201312 months with cognitive scales (e.g., MMSE, executive function tests), gait assessments, and bladder diaries. Repeat MRI every 1\u20132 years if clinical change suggests new vascular events. Adjust antihypertensive therapy based on ambulatory BP monitoring. Screen for falls risk and implement home safety interventions. Provide caregiver education on disease trajectory and advance care planning.","clinical_pearls":"1.

The patient cannot retain new information but has no behavioral issues and can recall everything from her past. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Alzheimer disease","Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Alzheimer disease","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Alzheimer disease (Correct)\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by progressive episodic memory impairment, difficulty learning new information, and preserved remote memory early on. Patients manifest spatial disorientation and executive dysfunction after 12 to 24 months, often requiring assistance with driving and appointments (per NIA-AA 2018 criteria). Neuropsychological testing shows encoding deficits with impaired delayed recall (sensitivity 82%, specificity 88%) and medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI in 75% of early AD patients (Sperling et al. 2011). Pathologically, amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles accumulate over 5\u201320 years, with CSF A\u03b242 reduced by 50% and p-tau increased by 60% (Blennow et al. 2015). Misconceptions include confusing age-related memory lapses with AD; unlike benign forgetfulness, AD features progressive functional decline.\nOption B: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)\nMCI presents with subjective memory complaints and objective deficits on testing but preserved independence in daily activities (per Petersen 2014). Amnestic MCI patients recall new information poorly but maintain driving and appointment management for 12\u201318 months, contrasting the functional impairment seen in AD. Conversion rate from MCI to AD is ~10\u201315% per year (Albert et al. 2011). In this scenario, inability to manage appointments and drive indicates interference in instrumental activities, excluding MCI.\nOption C: Vascular Dementia\nMulti-infarct dementia presents with stepwise cognitive decline, focal deficits, and MRI white matter hyperintensities (per AHA/ASA 2011). Episodic memory may be relatively spared early. Our patient lacks stroke history or focal signs, making vascular dementia unlikely.\nOption D: Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)\nFTD typically affects behavior and language before memory (per Rascovsky et al. 2011). Patients exhibit disinhibition or primary progressive aphasia, neither of which is present. Episodic memory remains intact until later stages, distinguishing FTD from AD.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomy and Pathways\nThe hippocampus (CA1\u2013CA4 regions) and entorhinal cortex within the medial temporal lobes are the earliest sites of AD pathology, critical for episodic memory encoding (per Braak & Braak 1991 staging). The perforant path transmits cortical information to dentate gyrus granule cells; degeneration here disrupts new learning. The posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus also show glucose hypometabolism early (FDG-PET sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%). Neuroanatomical landmarks include the hippocampal sulcus and collateral sulcus on coronal MRI. \nEmbryology and Normal Physiology\nThe hippocampal formation arises from the archicortex during the fifth gestational week, migrating neurons and establishing synapses by week 24. Long-term potentiation in CA3-CA1 synapses relies on NMDA receptor\u2013mediated Ca2+ influx and AMPA receptor trafficking. Acetylcholine from basal nucleus of Meynert modulates hippocampal plasticity via muscarinic receptors (M1 subtype), vital for attention and memory consolidation.\nRelated Conditions and History\nDescriptions of \u201csenium\u201d date to Alois Alzheimer\u2019s 1906 report of Auguste D., with neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. Over the 20th century, recognition of cholinergic deficits led to current acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatments. Other medial temporal pathologies include medial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis, which can mimic memory loss but differ in seizure history and imaging.","pathophysiology":"Molecular Mechanisms\nAD pathology begins decades before clinical onset with misfolding of amyloid precursor protein (APP) through \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase cleavage, producing A\u03b242 oligomers that aggregate extracellularly (Hardy & Selkoe 2002). Tau protein hyperphosphorylation by GSK-3\u03b2 and CDK5 leads to intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. Loss of synaptic NMDA receptor function and dendritic spine density occurs early, reducing LTP.\nGenetics and Inflammation\nEarly-onset familial AD (EOAD) comprises <1% of cases, associated with APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations (autosomal dominant, 85\u201395% penetrance) leading to increased A\u03b242 production. Late-onset AD risk is modulated by APOE \u03b54 allele (heterozygotes have 3\u00d7 risk, homozygotes 12\u00d7 risk) (Corder et al. 1993). Microglial activation via TREM2 variants triggers chronic neuroinflammation, with IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 elevated by 30\u201340% in CSF (Heneka et al. 2015).\nMetabolic and Compensatory Changes\nGlucose hypometabolism in posterior cingulate and temporoparietal cortex appears on FDG-PET 10\u201315 years preclinically. Astrocytic glycogen reserves and cerebrovascular autoregulation partially compensate initially but decline with capillary amyloid deposition. Progressive synaptic loss of up to 40% in hippocampus precedes neuron dropout by 5\u20137 years.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom Timeline\nProdromal phase (2\u20134 years): subtle memory lapses, word-finding difficulty. Mild stage (1\u20133 years): clear new learning deficit, misplacing items. Moderate stage (2\u20134 years): impaired IADLs, spatial disorientation, decline in dressing. Severe stage (1\u20132 years): global aphasia, incontinence, total care dependency (per Reisberg Functional Assessment Staging, FAST scale).\nNeurological Examination\nEarly: normal cranial nerves, motor, and reflexes. Mild: subtle praxis deficits, reduced finger\u2013nose coordination. Moderate: paratonia, myoclonus in 15% of cases. Hallucinations uncommon until late stage.\nDemographic Variations\nOnset <65 years (10% of cases) often has a stronger genetic component and faster decline. Women are affected at a 2:1 ratio, partly due to longevity. Non-amnestic presentations (e.g., posterior cortical atrophy) occur in younger patients.\nAssociated Manifestations and Red Flags\nBehavioral changes (agitation, apathy) emerge in moderate stage. Red flags: early gait disturbance suggests normal pressure hydrocephalus; focal deficits suggest stroke. Without treatment, median survival is 8\u201310 years post-diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical Evaluation\nPerform detailed history and cognitive assessment, including MMSE and MoCA (sensitivity 90%, specificity 87%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Rule out reversible causes.\nStep 2: First-Line Labs\nOrder CBC, TSH, vitamin B12, RPR, HIV (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Normal ranges: TSH 0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L; B12 >300 pg/mL.\nStep 3: Neuroimaging\nObtain MRI with volumetry and hippocampal atrophy assessment (Scheltens scale) per Alzheimer\u2019s Association 2021 guidelines. Look for medial temporal atrophy (grade \u22652). Exclude vascular lesions or NPH.\nStep 4: Biomarker Testing\nCSF analysis: A\u03b242 <500 pg/mL, total tau >350 pg/mL, p-tau >60 pg/mL (per NIA-AA 2018 criteria). PET amyloid imaging if CSF equivocal (Florbetapir retention ratio >1.1) per AAN 2022 practice parameter.\nStep 5: Electrophysiology\nEEG typically normal early; may show diffuse slowing in moderate\u2013severe stages (15\u201320% cases) per International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology 2020.\nStep 6: Differential Diagnosis\nDistinguish AD from MCI (no IADL impairment), vascular dementia (stepwise decline, focal signs), FTD (behavioral/language changes), Lewy body dementia (visual hallucinations, parkinsonism) per consensus criteria 2017.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line)\n1.

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is defined by early changes in personality, social conduct, and executive function while episodic memory and language are relatively spared in the initial stages. Numerous clinicopathologic series (Rascovsky et al. Neurology 2011;76:1006\u20131014) demonstrate that fewer than 20% of bvFTD patients exhibit significant memory impairment at presentation, and language deficits emerge later when temporal lobe involvement progresses. Option B is characteristic of Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than bvFTD. Option C (prominent visual hallucinations) is more indicative of dementia with Lewy bodies. Option D describes the nonfluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia, not bvFTD.","conceptual_foundation":"Behavioral variant FTD falls under the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in both ICD-11 and DSM-5 categorization. FTLD comprises three major clinical syndromes: bvFTD, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, and nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA. Early in bvFTD, neurodegeneration affects the medial and lateral frontal lobes, sparing medial temporal structures critical for memory encoding. Differential diagnoses include Alzheimer\u2019s disease, psychiatric disorders (major depression, bipolar), and other FTLD subtypes. Nosologically, bvFTD was first characterized in Neary et al. (Neurology 1998;51:1546\u20131554) and refined by Rascovsky et al. (Neurology 2011;76:1006\u20131014).","pathophysiology":"Normal frontal lobe physiology supports executive control, social cognition, and behavior. In bvFTD, accumulation of abnormal proteins (tau in Pick\u2019s disease, TDP-43 in FTLD-TDP) leads to neuronal loss and gliosis predominantly in dorsolateral, orbitofrontal, and medial frontal cortices. This disrupts frontostriatal and frontolimbic circuits, impairing inhibitory control, decision-making, and empathy. Molecularly, MAPT mutations cause tau aggregation; progranulin (GRN) mutations lead to TDP-43 pathology. Neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction further propagate network failure.","clinical_manifestation":"bvFTD typically presents in the sixth decade with insidious personality change, disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, compulsive behaviors, and dietary changes. Memory and visuospatial skills remain intact for 2\u20133 years. Subtypes include disinhibited vs. apathetic bvFTD. Prodromal features may mimic psychiatric illness. Untreated, the disease progresses over 6\u20138 years, with later emergence of memory and language deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on clinical criteria (Rascovsky et al. 2011): presence of three of six core features (disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, ritualistic behavior, hyperorality, executive dysfunction) with relative memory/language preservation. MRI/CT shows frontal and anterior temporal atrophy (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~70%). FDG-PET demonstrates hypometabolism in frontal lobes. CSF biomarkers (normal A\u03b242, tau) help exclude Alzheimer\u2019s disease (A\u03b242/tau ratio sensitivity 85%, specificity 78%). Genetic testing is indicated for familial cases.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy. Symptomatic management includes SSRIs (e.g., sertraline 50\u2013100 mg daily) for compulsive behaviors and disinhibition (Level C evidence), atypical antipsychotics for severe agitation (use lowest effective dose), and occupational therapy. Caregiver education and structured routines are essential. Risk of antipsychotic\u2013related adverse events requires close monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6 months with standardized behavioral scales (Neuropsychiatric Inventory) and cognitive testing (MoCA, Frontal Assessment Battery). Repeat MRI every 1\u20132 years if clinical uncertainty persists. Monitor for emergence of motor neuron disease signs, especially in C9orf72 mutation carriers. Plan for long-term care needs and advance directives early.","clinical_pearls":"1. Relative preservation of memory and language in early bvFTD distinguishes it from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Mnemonic: \u201cBEHAVIOR FIRST, MEMORY LAST.\u201d 2. Disinhibition and compulsive behaviors often lead to misdiagnosis as psychiatric illness. 3. Rascovsky criteria sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%. 4. Frontal atrophy on MRI in bvFTD often asymmetric. 5. C9orf72 expansions can present with bvFTD and ALS overlap.","references":"1.
