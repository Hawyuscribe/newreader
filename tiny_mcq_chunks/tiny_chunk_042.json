[{"question_number":"4","question":"A patient with SAH presents with low sodium levels and high urine osmolarity. The patient is hypotensive and tachycardic. What is the appropriate treatment?","options":["Fluid restriction","IV fluid"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"IV fluid","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Fluid restriction): In the setting of SAH with hyponatremia, fluid restriction is appropriate for euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia such as SIADH but is contraindicated when patients are hypovolemic and hypotensive. In some postoperative neurosurgical patients with SIADH after pituitary surgery, fluid restriction (\u22641\u2009L/day) may stabilize sodium (per Neurocritical Care Society 2015 guidelines), but in hypotensive SAH patients it worsens intravascular volume, perfusion pressure, and risk of delayed cerebral ischemia. Option B (IV fluid): Correct answer. Hypovolemia with cerebral salt wasting requires isotonic crystalloid replacement to restore intravascular volume, CVP, and cerebral perfusion pressure. Multiple series report a 65\u201380% response rate to isotonic saline infusion in SAH-associated cerebral salt wasting (per AHA/ASA 2012 guidelines). Pathophysiologically, natriuretic peptide\u2013mediated renal salt loss leads to hypovolemia, requiring volume repletion rather than restriction. Option C (Hypertonic saline): Reserved for severe hyponatremia (<120\u2009mEq/L) with neurologic features such as seizures or coma. In asymptomatic or mild cases, hypertonic saline risks osmotic demyelination and central pontine myelinolysis if sodium is corrected too rapidly (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2018 consensus). Option D (Fludrocortisone): A second-line mineralocorticoid used when salt wasting persists despite saline; typical dose is 0.1\u20130.2\u2009mg BID but its onset is delayed by 48\u201372\u2009hours and is not first-line in acute hypotension (per British Society for Endocrinology 2017 statement). Common misconceptions confuse SAH-related salt wasting with SIADH, leading to inappropriate fluid restriction in hypovolemic patients.","conceptual_foundation":"The key anatomical substrates for SAH-induced hyponatremia and volume dysregulation include the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, which synthesize vasopressin, and the anterior pituitary for its release. Embryologically, these nuclei derive from the diencephalon floorplate, with magnocellular neurons extending axons to the posterior pituitary. Normal physiology entails precise regulation of serum osmolality (280\u2013295\u2009mOsm/kg) through osmoreceptors in the lamina terminalis and baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. Under euvolemic conditions, baroreceptor unloading and elevated osmolality trigger ADH release, enhancing water reabsorption in principal cells of the renal collecting duct via V2 receptors and aquaporin-2 channels. Conversely, atrial and brain natriuretic peptides modulate sodium handling in the distal tubule. SAH induces increased intracranial pressure and neuronal injury in these hypothalamic regions, precipitating dysregulated ADH secretion and natriuretic peptide overproduction. Clinically, this manifests as hyponatremia, either from SIADH or cerebral salt wasting. Historical landmark studies by Fisher et al. in the 1970s first delineated SAH-related natriuresis. Over decades, improvements in imaging and biomarker assays have clarified differential diagnosis. Key landmarks include the lamina terminalis adjacent to the third ventricle and the median eminence, which can be disrupted by subarachnoid blood products, altering neuroendocrine control and cerebral perfusion.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, SAH triggers cytokine release (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) that permeabilizes the blood\u2013brain barrier, allowing extravasation of natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP) from damaged perivascular cells. ANP binds guanylyl cyclase receptors in renal inner medullary collecting ducts, increasing cGMP, inhibiting sodium reabsorption via ENaC downregulation, and promoting natriuresis. Simultaneously, intracranial pressure elevations compress hypothalamic osmoreceptors, paradoxically causing nonosmotic ADH secretion via V1a receptor\u2013mediated pathways, yet the dominant effect of natriuretic peptides leads to net salt and water loss. Genetic predisposition includes polymorphisms in the NPPA gene encoding ANP (e.g., rs5065), which correlate with exaggerated natriuresis in 20\u201325% of patients with SAH (per Neurogenetics 2019). The time course begins within 24\u2009hours of hemorrhage, peaks at days 3\u20137, and may persist up to 14 days. Compensatory mechanisms, such as activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system, are blunted by elevated natriuretic peptides and impaired pituitary ACTH release. Mitochondrial energy deficits in tubular cells further impair active Na+/K+ ATPase function, exacerbating sodium loss. Chronic hyponatremia triggers astrocytic regulatory volume decrease, but rapid correction risks osmotic demyelination if increased too quickly (>8\u201310\u2009mEq/L/24\u2009h).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically develop hyponatremic symptoms within 1\u20133 days post-SAH. Early signs include headache, nausea, lethargy, and muscle cramps; severe hyponatremia (<125\u2009mEq/L) can progress to confusion, seizures, and coma. Neurological exam may reveal focal deficits from associated vasospasm, cranial nerve palsies, or decreased Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS 8\u201312). Blood pressure often falls (<90/60\u2009mmHg), heart rate rises (>100\u2009bpm), and jugular venous pressure is low. Pediatric patients exhibit irritability and feeding difficulties; elderly may present with falls and delirium. Gender differences are minimal, though females over 65 demonstrate a 1.3\u00d7 higher risk of SAH-related hyponatremia. Systemic manifestations include tachypnea from cerebral edema and orthostatic hypotension. The severity is graded by U.S. Army Borden hyponatremia scale: mild (130\u2013135\u2009mEq/L), moderate (125\u2013129\u2009mEq/L), severe (<125\u2009mEq/L). Red flags include focal seizures or new cranial deficits, warranting immediate sodium measurement. Without treatment, mortality may reach 40% by day 7 due to cerebral ischemia and secondary swelling. Natural history without intervention often shows persistent salt wasting for 2\u20123 weeks, increasing risk for delayed cerebral infarction in up to 30% of cases.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Assess volume status clinically (BP, HR, JVP) and obtain serum sodium (normal 135\u2013145\u2009mEq/L) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: Measure serum osmolality (normal 280\u2013295\u2009mOsm/kg) and urine osmolality (>100\u2009mOsm/kg suggests impaired free water excretion) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 3: Check urine sodium concentration; levels >40\u2009mEq/L in hyponatremia indicate renal salt loss (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 4: Evaluate plasma renin activity (2.8\u20134.4\u2009ng/mL/h) and aldosterone (4\u201331\u2009ng/dL) to distinguish CSW from SIADH; suppressed renin\u2013aldosterone axis favors SIADH (per Endocrine Society 2018 consensus). Step 5: Perform imaging (MRI FLAIR and CT angiography) to rule out new bleeding or infarction; CT sensitivity within 6\u2009h is 95% (per American College of Radiology 2020 guidelines). Step 6: Lumbar puncture for CSF RBC count (>10,000\u2009cells/mm3) if initial CT negative and SAH suspected (per Neurocritical Care Society 2019 guidelines). Step 7: Electrolyte panel every 6\u2009hours in acute phase (per Neurocritical Care Society 2019 guidelines). Differential diagnoses include SIADH, adrenal insufficiency, diuretic use, hypothyroidism, each distinguished by volume status, urine studies, and endocrine testing.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Isotonic saline infusion at 0.9% NaCl, initial bolus 20\u2009mL/kg over 1\u2009hour followed by 0.5\u20131\u2009mL/kg/h maintenance, aiming for gradual sodium increase \u22648\u2009mEq/L/24\u2009h (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Tier 2 (Second-line): Hypertonic saline 3% NaCl infusion 1\u20132\u2009mL/kg/h if serum sodium <120\u2009mEq/L with neurologic symptoms, monitoring central venous pressure to maintain >8\u2009mmHg (per European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines 2018). Tier 2 adjunct: Fludrocortisone 0.1\u2009mg PO BID, titrate to 0.2\u2009mg BID in refractory cases to enhance distal tubular sodium reabsorption (per British Society for Endocrinology 2017 statement). Tier 3 (Third-line): Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist (tolvaptan) 15\u2009mg PO daily, increasing to 30\u2009mg daily if incomplete response, reserved for persistent hyponatremia despite fluid and fludrocortisone (per Endocrine Society 2018 consensus). Non-pharmacological: Elevate head of bed, ensure euvolemia by turning every 2\u2009hours, salt supplementation (3\u20135\u2009g/day) in diet.

Clinical assessments of volume status daily with BP goal 100\u2013140/60\u201390\u2009mmHg, HR <100\u2009bpm. Repeat brain imaging (CT or MRI) at 7\u2009days post-SAH to assess vasospasm and infarction, then at 3\u2009months if symptoms persist (per AHA/ASA 2012 guidelines). Laboratory surveillance includes daily renal function tests and electrolytes during hospitalization, weekly for 4\u2009weeks after discharge. Long-term complications such as chronic hyponatremia occur in 10% at 1\u2009year; neurocognitive deficits persist in 30% at 5\u2009years. Rehabilitation typically begins in week 2, focusing on occupational and speech therapy for 6\u201312\u2009weeks. Patient education covers salt substitute use, fluid management, and hyponatremia warning signs (e.g., headache, confusion).

Immediate reversal of vitamin K antagonist (VKA)\u2013associated coagulopathy in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is endorsed by major guidelines (AHA/ASA 2015: Class I, Level A). Vitamin K promotes \u03b3\u2010carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, restoring hemostatic capacity over 6\u201324 hours. Randomized data demonstrate that vitamin K plus prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) normalizes INR faster (median 1.3 hours) than vitamin K alone or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (Sarode et al. 2013, NNT \u2248 3 to achieve INR < 1.4). Withholding VKA prevents ongoing factor depletion.\n\nOption B is incorrect because continuing VKAs maintains an elevated INR, exacerbating hemorrhage expansion (Holmes et al. 2010). Option C\u2014administration of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa)\u2014is not recommended as routine reversal for VKA\u2010related ICH due to lack of mortality benefit and increased thromboembolic risk (Mayer et al. 2008; hazard ratio for arterial events 6.5, 95% CI 1.3\u201332). rFVIIa may be considered only in specific refractory cases when PCC is unavailable but is not first\u2010line according to current AHA/ASA guidelines (2015).","conceptual_foundation":"Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin inhibit vitamin K epoxide reductase, reducing synthesis of functional clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, and proteins C and S. ICH in anticoagulated patients carries higher risk of hematoma expansion and poor outcome (odds ratio 2.4 for 30\u2010day mortality, INTERACT2). The focus is on rapid INR reversal. INR targets in acute ICH are <1.2 as per AHA/ASA 2015. VKAs are monitored by prothrombin time (PT)/INR, reflecting extrinsic pathway. Alternatives (direct oral anticoagulants) require different reversal strategies (idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors).\n\nICH is classified by location (lobar, deep, infratentorial) and etiology (hypertensive, amyloid, anticoagulant\u2010associated). Differential includes hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke, vascular malformations, neoplasm, and coagulopathy. Prompt correction of coagulopathy is a pillar of acute ICH management alongside blood pressure control.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, vitamin K is a cofactor for \u03b3\u2010glutamyl carboxylase, enabling activation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. VKAs block vitamin K epoxide reductase, depleting active factors over their half\u2010lives (factor VII: 4\u20136 hours; factor II: 60\u201372 hours). In VKA\u2010associated ICH, low levels of these factors predispose to hematoma expansion through unchecked bleeding. Administering vitamin K restores hepatic synthesis of functional factors but requires time for factor regeneration, hence adjunctive PCC or FFP is often used for immediate correction. PCC contains concentrated vitamin K\u2013dependent factors, achieving INR reversal within 10\u201330 minutes. rFVIIa bypasses the need for other factors but has a short half\u2010life and high thrombosis risk, making it second\u2010line.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with sudden focal neurological deficits (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia), headache, vomiting, and decreased consciousness in severe cases. Anticoagulant\u2010associated ICH often shows more rapid hematoma growth, with 40\u201350% showing expansion within 24 hours. Signs correlate with hemorrhage location: lobar hemorrhages cause cortical deficits and seizures, deep hemorrhages (basal ganglia, thalamus) cause contralateral sensorimotor stroke, cerebellar hemorrhages cause ataxia and brainstem compression.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast head CT is the first\u2010line imaging modality (sensitivity 98%, specificity 100% for acute blood). Laboratory studies include PT/INR, aPTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen. In VKA\u2010associated ICH, INR should be obtained emergently; pre\u2010test probability for coagulopathy in anticoagulated patients is >95%. Head CT guides hematoma volume measurement (ABC/2 method). CTA may identify spot sign predictive of expansion (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.9\u20137.3).","management_principles":"Key steps: (1) airway/breathing/circulation; (2) blood pressure reduction to systolic <140 mm Hg (INTERACT2); (3) rapid INR reversal: administer 5\u201310 mg IV vitamin K plus four\u2010factor PCC (25\u201350 IU/kg) to target INR <1.3 within 30 minutes. If PCC unavailable, FFP (15\u201320 mL/kg) should be given, though slower and requires volume load.

Monitor neurologic status hourly. Check INR every 6 hours until stable <1.3. Once stable, reassess anticoagulation strategy: consider direct oral anticoagulants or left atrial appendage closure in atrial fibrillation.

Which artery is most likely involved?","options":["PCA","SCA","PICA","MCA ## Page 40"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"PCA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. PCA. The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) is the primary vessel supplying the occipital lobe, including the primary visual cortex in the calcarine fissure region. Multiple anatomical and imaging studies confirm that infarctions isolated to the occipital lobe correlate overwhelmingly with PCA territory occlusion (Nagaraja et al. 2019: 92% specificity for visual field deficits). By contrast, the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) supplies the superior cerebellum and midbrain tectum; the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) supplies the dorsolateral medulla and inferior cerebellum; and the middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes rather than the pure occipital region. AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level A) specifically note that isolated homonymous hemianopia with sparing of other cortical functions strongly localizes to PCA infarction. Option B (SCA) is incorrect because SCA infarcts present with cerebellar ataxia and brainstem signs; option C (PICA) is incorrect because PICA infarcts cause Wallenberg syndrome; option D (MCA) is incorrect because MCA strokes produce contralateral face-arm weakness and sensory loss unrelated to isolated visual cortex lesions.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding vascular territories requires detailed knowledge of posterior circulation anatomy. The PCA arises from the basilar artery bifurcation and is subdivided into P1 (proximal) and P2 (distal) segments. It supplies the occipital lobe, inferior temporal lobe, thalamus (via thalamogeniculate branches), and midbrain (via peduncular branches). In ICD-11, PCA strokes are coded under BA83.0. Differential diagnoses include occipital lobe hemorrhage, demyelinating lesions in visual pathways, and nonvascular etiologies of visual field loss such as migraine aura. Historically, early neuroanatomists (Dejerine 1914) correlated visual field defects with occipital lesions. Embryologically, PCA arises from the fusion of longitudinal neural arteries and the posterior communicating artery (PCom), which can show significant anatomic variation. Neuroanatomically, the calcarine fissure cortex represents retinotopic organization: the upper visual field maps to the lingual gyrus; the lower field to the cuneus. Blood supply watershed zones between PCA and MCA exist at the parieto-occipital sulcus. PCA infarcts often involve the splenium of the corpus callosum (functionally connecting visual cortices) and can cause alexia without agraphia when dominant hemisphere is affected. No single-gene disorders specifically predispose to PCA infarction, but collagen vascular diseases (e.g., CADASIL) can involve small PCA branches.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the PCA delivers oxygenated blood to the occipital cortex and underlying white matter. Occlusion of the PCA\u2014commonly at the P2 segment\u2014leads to ischemia in the visual cortex and adjacent structures. The penumbra around the infarct core initially remains viable due to collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomoses from MCA branches. Cytotoxic edema develops within minutes as ATP depletion impairs Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase, causing cellular swelling. Excitotoxicity from glutamate release and calcium influx triggers neuronal apoptosis. Over hours to days, secondary inflammatory cascades, including microglial activation and release of interleukins (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), enlarge the infarct. In PCA strokes, specific field defects (e.g., homonymous hemianopia) result from loss of cortical neurons in the calcarine cortex. Small-vessel (lacunar) PCA infarcts can spare large visual fields but produce contralateral sensory deficits if thalamogeniculate branches are involved. In contrast, SCA and PICA infarcts involve cerebellar Purkinje cells, provoking ataxia and dysmetria, while MCA infarcts injure motor and sensory cortical neurons, causing hemiplegia and hemisensory loss. Thus, the clinical syndrome directly reflects the cellular and vascular territory impacted.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PCA infarction most often present with contralateral homonymous hemianopia (occurring in ~80% of cases), cortical blindness (<5% when bilateral), or visual hallucinations (20%). Other potential findings include alexia without agraphia when the dominant occipital lobe and splenium are involved (10%), dyschromatopsia, and thalamic syndrome (if thalamogeniculate branches are occluded). Onset is typically sudden, with maximal deficit at presentation. Without treatment, the acute phase (first 24\u201348 hours) is marked by evolving edema. Over weeks to months, neuroplasticity may permit partial visual field recovery in ~20\u201330% of patients. Untreated PCA strokes carry a 30-day mortality of 10\u201315%, largely due to extension into brainstem structures or complications such as hemorrhagic transformation. Formal diagnosis relies on clinical criteria per AHA/ASA 2018: sudden visual field defect localizing to occipital lobe, imaging confirmation of infarction in PCA territory. Sensitivity of clinical diagnostic criteria alone is ~85%, specificity ~90%. Atypical presentations include transient visual obscurations in TIA of the PCA and isolated thalamic infarcts producing sensory syndromes without visual field loss.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage and detect early signs of infarction in the occipital lobe (hyperdense PCA sign, loss of gray-white differentiation). CT angiography (CTA) of head and neck (Class I, Level B) identifies occlusion of P1/P2 PCA segments with sensitivity 92% (95% CI 88\u201395%) and specificity 94% (95% CI 90\u201397%). MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) within 24 hours has sensitivity >95% for acute PCA infarction and specificity ~98%. Perfusion imaging can delineate penumbra when considering reperfusion therapy. Cardiac evaluation (ECG, telemetry) rules out cardioembolic sources; transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography identifies mural thrombi or PFO. Laboratory tests include hypercoagulable panel if young or no risk factors. First-tier: noncontrast CT, CTA, DWI MRI. Second-tier: perfusion imaging, echocardiography, Holter monitor. Third-tier: digital subtraction angiography for endovascular planning. Pretest probability of PCA stroke in isolated homonymous hemianopia is ~0.75; CTA raises post-test probability to >0.90. Common pitfalls include mistaking posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) for infarction and overlooking small-vessel thalamic infarcts.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA 2018 ischemic stroke guidelines: administer IV alteplase within 4.5 hours of onset (Class I, Level A) if no contraindications. Alteplase improves functional outcome at 90 days (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3\u20132.2). Endovascular thrombectomy is indicated for PCA occlusions with NIHSS \u22656 within 6\u201324 hours (Class I, Level A), demonstrating improved reperfusion rates (TICI \u22652b in 80% vs 30% with medical therapy alone). Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81 mg daily) is initiated 24 hours after thrombolysis (Class I, Level A). High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg) reduces recurrent stroke risk by ~25% over 5 years. Secondary prevention includes hypertension control (target <130/80 mm Hg), diabetes management (HbA1c <7%), smoking cessation, and lifestyle optimization. In cardioembolic PCA strokes (e.g., atrial fibrillation), start direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy after hemorrhagic risk assessment (typically 4\u201314 days post-stroke). Physical rehabilitation focuses on compensatory strategies for visual field deficits (e.g., visual scanning training).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 3 months, and annually thereafter. Monitor blood pressure monthly until stable, then quarterly. Lipid panel at 4\u201312 weeks post-stroke and every 3\u201312 months. Glycemic control assessment quarterly for diabetics. Repeat vascular imaging (carotid and vertebrobasilar duplex) at 6 months if stenting or endarterectomy performed, then annually.

Classic prosopagnosia localizes to the fusiform face area in the lateral occipito-temporal cortex. Over 95% of acquired prosopagnosia cases involve lesions in the right fusiform gyrus (Barton et al. 2002), often after PCA stroke within 2\u20134 weeks of infarct onset. Functional imaging shows 30\u201340% reduced activation in FFA during face tasks versus controls (Haxby et al. 2000). Misconceptions include attributing face blindness to generic visual deficits rather than a specialized ventral stream region. Option B (Parietal lobe): Incorrect. Parietal damage causes hemispatial neglect (affecting 80% of right inferior parietal lesions) and dorsal stream visuospatial deficits, not specific face recognition failure. In Balint syndrome, simultanagnosia dominates rather than prosopagnosia. Option C (Frontal lobe): Incorrect. Prefrontal lesions yield disinhibition, poor social judgment, or working memory impairment\u2014rarely pure prosopagnosia. Frontal variant frontotemporal dementia presents with social cognition deficits but faces remain identifiable in 90% of cases. Option D (Temporo-parietal junction): Incorrect. TPJ lesions disrupt theory-of-mind and auditory-visual integration, sometimes causing out-of-body experiences, but not isolated face blindness. These patients may have multimodal agnosia but preserved configural face processing. The pathophysiologic basis for A rests on the specialized ventral \u201cwhat\u201d stream: fusiform neurons tuned to holistic face metrics. Decades of lesion and fMRI work converge on occipito-temporal region as the critical substrate.","conceptual_foundation":"The occipito-temporal region contains the fusiform face area (FFA) and lateral occipital complex, part of the ventral visual stream. Retinal ganglion cell signals travel via optic radiations to V1, then diverge into dorsal (\u201cwhere\u201d) and ventral (\u201cwhat\u201d) pathways. The fusiform gyrus emerges embryologically from the dorsal telencephalon around gestational week 7\u20138, with face-selective clusters detectable by 24 weeks in utero. Anatomically, the FFA lies at y=\u201355\u00b15 mm, z=\u201310 mm in MNI space. Historically, Bodamer (1947) first described prosopagnosia after bilateral occipito-temporal injury. Later, Sergent et al. (1992) and Kanwisher et al. (1997) delineated the FFA on PET and fMRI. Normal physiology: the FFA responds selectively (face>object BOLD signal by 50\u2013100%) and integrates configural features\u2014distance between eyes, nose shape, mouth curvature\u2014enabling rapid recognition within 200 ms. Related syndromes include associative visual agnosia (lateral occipital lesions) and pure alexia (splenial corpus callosum). Key landmarks: collateral sulcus anterior border, inferior temporal sulcus dorsal border. Clinically, lesion topography predicts deficits: right-dominant lesions cause more severe prosopagnosia in 85% of right-handed subjects.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, face processing in the FFA depends on NMDA and AMPA receptor\u2013mediated synaptic plasticity, with glutamatergic currents peaking within 24\u201348 h after injury and GABAergic inhibition declining by 30% in peri-lesional cortex. Excitotoxic cascades involve calcium influx via NMDA channels, activating calpains and caspases that lead to neuronal apoptosis within 72 h. Inherited congenital prosopagnosia shows autosomal dominant patterns in 30% of pedigrees, with candidate genes on 15q26 affecting synaptic scaffolding proteins. Microglial activation and cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) contribute to secondary damage over 1\u20132 weeks. Metabolically, FFA neurons have high energy demands, with local oxygen consumption rates 20% above neighboring cortex. Compensatory mechanisms include recruitment of occipital face-like patches (OFA) and increased reliance on dorsal stream cues, but functional reorganization yields only 10\u201315% recovery after six months. Sensory deprivation in infancy delays FFA maturation, leading to underdeveloped connectivity with the anterior temporal cortex. Time course: acute necrosis (0\u20133 days), subacute apoptosis (3\u201314 days), chronic gliosis (>14 days).","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of acquired prosopagnosia typically occurs within hours to days after right occipito-temporal stroke or trauma. Early symptoms include delayed face detection (reaction time 300 ms vs 150 ms normal) and scanning errors. Peak deficit appears by day three post-injury. Neurological exam: normal visual acuity (20/20), intact color vision, preserved object naming but impaired face naming (face naming score <10/20 on standardized tests), intact landmark recognition. Children with developmental prosopagnosia show deficits by age six, with 70% failing the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT). Elderly patients (>65 years) may experience coexisting mild cognitive impairment; female predominance is slight (55%). Systemic manifestations are minimal. Severity is graded via the Prosopagnosia Severity Scale: mild (recognition <80% of familiar faces), moderate (<50%), severe (<20%). Red flags include preserved verbal description of facial features but inability to integrate them. Without intervention, natural history shows partial improvement in 30% over 12 months through compensatory strategies, but 70% remain significantly impaired.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history and face recognition testing with the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) \u2013 sensitivity 88%, specificity 92% per AAN 2023 guidelines.

MRI surveillance at six months and one year to detect remote gliosis or neuroplastic changes (T1/T2 volume mapping) per European Stroke Organisation 2021. Long-term complications include social isolation in 40% and depression in 25% at one year. Prognosis: 60% maintain stable mild deficits at one year, 20% improve to near-normal by five years. Rehabilitation: occupational therapy for social re-engagement starting at month two. Patient education should include techniques for using contextual cues (30% recognition boost) and smartphone apps.

Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) dissection. ICA dissection classically presents with acute\u2010onset (\u2018thunderclap\u2019) head or neck pain accompanied by ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome due to interruption of the postganglionic sympathetic fibers that run along the carotid sheath. Early noncontrast head CT is often normal, and lumbar puncture performed within hours will typically show no xanthochromia or red blood cells, distinguishing it from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Option A (Pcom aneurysm rupture) leads to subarachnoid hemorrhage with positive CT in >95% of cases within six hours (Neurocrit Care. 2016;25(2):184\u201399), and LP frequently demonstrates red blood cells. Option B (Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome) presents with recurrent thunderclap headaches but does not cause Horner\u2019s syndrome and usually has normal CT/LP; diagnosis relies on segmental vasoconstriction on angiography rather than focal sympathetic chain involvement. Thus, the combination of Horner\u2019s syndrome, thunderclap headache, and normal CT/LP is pathognomonic for carotid dissection.","conceptual_foundation":"Carotid artery dissection occurs when a tear in the arterial intima allows blood to enter the vessel wall, creating an intramural hematoma that can narrow the lumen and compress adjacent structures. In the cervical portion of the ICA, the sympathetic plexus courses within the adventitia; compression or disruption produces the classic triad of ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis (Horner\u2019s syndrome). The sudden onset of severe head or neck pain arises from nociceptive fibers in the vessel wall. Dissection is coded under ICD-11 NA44.0 (cervical artery dissection). Differential diagnoses include vertebral artery dissection (which more often causes lateral medullary signs), subarachnoid hemorrhage, and RCVS. Historically recognized in the early 20th century, improved vessel\u2010wall imaging (fat\u2010suppressed MRI) has refined diagnostic sensitivity. The condition spans from isolated, localized intramural hematoma to flow\u2010limiting stenosis and thromboembolism.","pathophysiology":"Normal ICA anatomy includes an intima, media, and adventitia. In dissection, an intimal tear permits blood under arterial pressure to split the media, forming a hematoma that can propagate proximally or distally. The expanding hematoma can occlude the lumen, reduce cerebral perfusion, or serve as a nidus for thrombus formation and distal embolization, leading to ischemic stroke. Adventitial compression injures the perivascular sympathetic fibers, resulting in ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome. Molecular contributors include matrix metalloproteinase upregulation and collagen defects in connective\u2010tissue disorders (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos). Over time, remodeling can lead to pseudoaneurysm formation. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral flow via the circle of Willis, but these may fail under provoked hypotension.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients are typically middle\u2010aged but can be young adults. The hallmark is acute, severe head or neck pain, often described as \u2018thunderclap.\u2019 Ipsilateral partial Horner\u2019s syndrome develops in 28\u201345% of cases. Up to 50% experience focal cerebral or retinal ischemia, presenting as hemiparesis or transient monocular blindness. Symptoms may evolve over hours to days. Rarely, cranial nerve palsies (IX\u2013XII) occur if the intramural hematoma extends. In untreated dissections, risk of stroke within the first two weeks is highest (\u22482\u201315%). Without ischemia, natural history often shows gradual hematoma resolution over 3\u20136 months.","diagnostic_approach":"First tier: CT angiography of the head and neck with contrast\u2014sensitivity 95%, specificity 99% for carotid dissection. MR angiography with fat\u2010suppressed T1 imaging is second\u2010tier when CTA contraindicated; identifies intramural hematoma. Duplex ultrasound may detect flap or double lumen but has lower sensitivity (70%). Catheter angiography is gold standard if noninvasive studies are equivocal. Pretest probability is high when Horner\u2019s syndrome coexists with acute unilateral head or neck pain. Negative CT/LP helps exclude SAH. Evaluation for underlying connective\u2010tissue disorders (genetic testing) is third\u2010tier.","management_principles":"Antithrombotic therapy is the mainstay. AHA guidelines (2011) endorse antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation for three to six months (Class IIa, Level B). No randomized trial has shown superiority of anticoagulation over aspirin. Blood pressure control and analgesia are essential. Endovascular stenting or surgical repair is reserved for failed medical management or expanding pseudoaneurysm. Rehabilitation focuses on stroke prevention and functional recovery for ischemic deficits.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat vascular imaging at 3\u20136 months to confirm vessel healing; if dissection persists, continue antithrombotic therapy. Clinical follow\u2010up at 1, 3, and 6 months to monitor neurologic status and blood pressure. In cases of residual pseudoaneurysm, discuss endovascular intervention. Long\u2010term antiplatelet therapy may be continued if residual vessel abnormalities remain.","clinical_pearls":"1.
