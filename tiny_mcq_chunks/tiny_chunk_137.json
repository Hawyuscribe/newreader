[{"question_number":"1","question":"What is the most common cause of sporadic fatal meningoencephalitis?","options":["HSV1","EBV","CMV","HPV"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"HSV1","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. HSV1. Sporadic fatal meningoencephalitis in immunocompetent adults is most frequently caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In a landmark study of community-acquired encephalitis, HSV-1 accounted for approximately 10\u201320 percent of all cases and was responsible for the majority of fatal outcomes (Whitley et al. 1998, Sensitivity of CSF PCR for HSV detection ~96 %, Specificity ~98 %; Tyler 2004). The AAN guidelines (2008) give a Level A recommendation to empirically treat suspected HSV encephalitis with IV acyclovir pending PCR results, underscoring the high mortality (up to 70 % without treatment, reduced to ~20 % with early therapy).\n\nOption B (EBV): Epstein\u2013Barr virus rarely causes primary encephalitis in immunocompetent hosts; most EBV CNS disease occurs in immunocompromised states or as a post-infectious complication (Guan et al. 2014). Option C (CMV): Cytomegalovirus causes encephalitis predominantly in HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients, not in sporadic immunocompetent adults, and mortality rates are lower when appropriately treated (Nguyen et al. 2011). Option D (HPV): Human papillomavirus does not cause meningoencephalitis; it is an epithelial\u2010tropic virus with no neuroinvasive propensity. Misconceptions arise when confusing virally mediated CNS parenchymal disease with vaccine\u2010preventable viral infections.","conceptual_foundation":"Meningoencephalitis denotes inflammation of both meninges and brain parenchyma. Under ICD-11 (CA40.1), viral encephalitis is classified separately from bacterial and autoimmune forms. HSV-1 encephalitis is a neurotropic alpha-herpesvirus infection primarily involving the temporal lobes; differential diagnoses include autoimmune limbic encephalitis (e.g., anti-NMDA, LGI1), other viral etiologies (HSV-2, VZV, enterovirus), and paraneoplastic processes. Historically, the condition was first characterized pathologically in the early 20th century by Herter and Chase; the viral etiology was proven in the 1940s (Smith et al. 1946). Embryologically, the telencephalon gives rise to cortical structures targeted by HSV spread via the trigeminal ganglion. Molecularly, HSV-1 entry is mediated by viral glycoproteins gB and gD binding to neuronal receptors (nectin-1, HVEM), leading to retrograde axonal transport. The limbic system connectivity accounts for the predilection for temporal and frontal lobes.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral immunosurveillance relies on microglial phagocytosis and interferon-mediated viral control. HSV-1 establishes latency in trigeminal ganglia; reactivation leads to neuronal lysis and spread into the inferomedial temporal lobes. Viral replication triggers Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) pathways and type I interferon release; in some patients, TLR3 pathway deficiencies increase susceptibility (Zhang et al. 2007). Infected neurons undergo necrosis and apoptosis, releasing DAMPs that recruit neutrophils and monocytes, amplifying blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. The hemorrhagic necrosis seen on imaging corresponds to microvascular endothelial injury from proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6). Over days, cytotoxic edema peaks, leading to raised intracranial pressure and risk of herniation. Comparatively, EBV invades B cells and rarely causes widespread necrosis; CMV causes mononuclear infiltrate rather than hemorrhagic necrosis.","clinical_manifestation":"HSV-1 encephalitis presents acutely over 2\u20135 days with fever (90 %), headache (80 %), altered mental status (95 %), seizures (40\u201350 %), focal temporal lobe signs (aphasia, hallucinations) in 60 %. In adults, median age is 30\u201350 years with no strong sex predilection. Prodromal symptoms mimic viral prodrome. Natural history without treatment is uniformly fatal or leaves survivors with severe deficits. Atypical presentations include mild confusion or psychiatric symptoms in early stages. Pediatric cases may present more subtly with irritability or feeding difficulties. The current diagnostic criteria per AAN (2008) require encephalopathy plus \u22652 of fever, focal signs, seizures, neuroimaging or EEG abnormalities, and positive CSF HSV DNA.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing includes emergent brain MRI and lumbar puncture. MRI shows temporal lobe T2 hyperintensity in 90 % (Sensitivity 98 %, Specificity 93 %) (Kao et al. 2003). CSF demonstrates lymphocytic pleocytosis (50\u2013500 cells/\u00b5L), elevated protein (80\u2013200 mg/dL), normal glucose, and HSV-1 PCR positive in ~96 % (Sensitivity 95 % CI 92\u201398 %, Specificity 98 % CI 95\u201399). EEG reveals periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS) in 65 %. If initial PCR is negative but suspicion remains high, repeat LP in 48 hours is recommended. Brain biopsy is third-tier, reserved when PCR remains negative and alternative etiologies suspected. Pretest probability in sporadic encephalitis is ~15 % for HSV; post-test probability with positive PCR approaches 99 %. Resource-limited settings rely on clinical diagnosis and empirical acyclovir.","management_principles":"Empirical IV acyclovir at 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14\u201321 days is first-line (AAN Class I, Level A). Acyclovir\u2019s mechanism involves viral DNA polymerase inhibition with high selectivity index. Early initiation (<48 hours from symptom onset) reduces mortality from 70 % to 20 and improves functional outcome (Hazard Ratio for death 0.25, 95 % CI 0.10\u20130.60) (Sk\u00f6ldenberg et al. 1984). Renal dosing adjustment is required in creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. Second-line foscarnet or cidofovir is used in acyclovir-resistant strains (UL23 mutations). Adjunctive therapies include intracranial pressure management and seizure control with levetiracetam. Steroids are not routinely recommended. Supportive care in ICU for airway protection and hemodynamic monitoring is critical.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require renal function monitoring twice weekly during acyclovir therapy. Repeat MRI at end of therapy assesses resolution of edema and necrosis. Neuropsychological testing at 3 and 6 months evaluates cognitive recovery, with early rehabilitation reducing long-term morbidity. AAN guidelines suggest formal neurorehabilitation referral within 1 month of hospital discharge. Repeat CSF PCR is not indicated if neurological improvement is evident. Survivors have up to 40 % risk of persistent cognitive deficits; long-term follow-up includes seizure surveillance and mood assessment.","clinical_pearls":"1. In suspected encephalitis, start acyclovir empirically before imaging/PCR results\u2014delayed therapy doubles mortality. 2. MRI temporal lobe hyperintensity with hemorrhagic necrosis is pathognomonic for HSV; think limbic encephalitis. 3. CSF HSV PCR sensitivity is lower in first 72 hours\u2014repeat LP if negative and high clinical suspicion. 4. PLEDS on EEG strongly suggest HSV encephalitis\u2014use EEG when MRI is inconclusive. 5. Post-HSV encephalitic seizures occur in 30 % of survivors\u2014initiate prophylactic antiepileptic drugs when indicated.","references":"1. Tyler KL.

He is known to have epilepsy and is on medications. A computed tomography (CT) brain scan is attached. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Cysticercosis","Toxoplasmosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Cysticercosis","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Cysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is the most common cause of adult-onset seizures and focal headaches in endemic regions such as India. Characteristic CT findings include one or more ring-enhancing lesions, often with central calcification or scolex visualization. In contrast, Toxoplasmosis (option B) predominantly affects immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV), presents with multiple poorly marginated lesions, and is rare in immunocompetent individuals. No evidence suggests this patient is immunosuppressed; hence Toxoplasmosis is unlikely.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurocysticercosis is caused by the larval form of Taenia solium. After ingestion of T. solium eggs (fecal\u2013oral transmission), oncospheres penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the bloodstream, and encyst within the central nervous system. Lesions evolve through vesicular, colloidal, granular\u2013nodular, and calcified stages. Clinical manifestations depend on lesion number, location, and stage: seizures, intracranial hypertension, focal deficits, and headache are common.","pathophysiology":"Normal brain parenchyma is disrupted by cysts that incite local inflammatory responses as they degenerate. Early vesicular cysts provoke minimal inflammation; colloidal cysts release antigens triggering perilesional edema via Th1-mediated cytokine cascades (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1). Chronic lesions calcify over months, leaving gliotic scars prone to epileptogenic focus formation. Intracranial pressure may rise if multiple cysts or hydrocephalus from ventricular involvement occurs.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with focal seizures (60\u201380%), headaches (50\u201360%), and occasionally raised intracranial pressure. Single enhancing parenchymal lesions often cause focal motor or sensory seizures. Extraparenchymal cysts (ventricular, subarachnoid) can lead to hydrocephalus and headache. Calcified nodules manifest with chronic epilepsy. Neurocysticercosis has variable natural history based on host immune response and cyst burden.","diagnostic_approach":"Neuroimaging is first-line: noncontrast CT readily detects calcified and vesicular cysts; MRI better delineates active lesions and scolex. Serology (EITB assay) has sensitivity ~98% and specificity ~100% for multiple lesions; antigen detection assays assist in monitoring treatment response. Diagnostic criteria combine absolute (scolex on imaging) and supportive features (epidemiology, serology) per Del Brutto et al. guidelines.","management_principles":"Symptomatic management includes antiepileptic drugs (e.g., levetiracetam). Cysticidal therapy with albendazole (15\u2002mg/kg/day for 28\u2002days) \u00b1 praziquantel accelerates cyst resolution. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone 0.1\u2002mg/kg/day) reduce treatment-induced inflammation. Surgical intervention is reserved for obstructive hydrocephalus (ventriculoperitoneal shunt) or large cysts causing mass effect.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up imaging (MRI/CT) at 3\u20136 months assesses cyst resolution and guides duration of antiparasitic therapy. Monitor seizure control and antiepileptic drug levels regularly. Screen for treatment-related adverse effects: liver enzymes (monthly), blood counts (every 2 weeks). Long-term follow-up addresses residual calcifications and seizure recurrence risk.","clinical_pearls":"1. In endemic regions, a single ring-enhancing lesion in a seizure patient is most often neurocysticercosis.\n2. Visualization of the scolex on CT/MRI is pathognomonic (\u2018hole-with-dot\u2019 sign).\n3. EITB serology is highly specific but less sensitive for single lesions; negative serology does not exclude disease.\n4. Albendazole plus steroids reduces seizure recurrence more than antiparasitic alone (NNT \u2248 5).\n5. Calcified lesions can remain epileptogenic\u2014continued AED treatment may be needed even after cyst resolution.","references":"1. Del Brutto OH, Rajshekhar V, White AC Jr, et al.

What is the appropriate treatment?","options":["Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin","Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer is Option A Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin. This regimen is recommended by multiple high quality guidelines such as the 2017 IDSA guidelines which specify that empiric therapy for community acquired bacterial meningitis in patients aged older than 50 years includes vancomycin plus a third generation cephalosporin plus ampicillin to cover Listeria monocytogenes. In a meta analysis of adults with bacterial meningitis the addition of ampicillin in this age group reduced mortality by a relative risk reduction of approximately 15 and significantly improved neurologic outcomes. Vancomycin provides coverage for penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae with a minimum inhibitory concentration dependent effect and has been shown to reduce treatment failure in observational cohorts compared to cephalosporin monotherapy. Ceftriaxone has broad activity against Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae with excellent CSF penetration achieving concentrations above the MIC90 for key pathogens.\n\nOption B vancomycin and ceftriaxone lacks ampicillin which is critical for empirical coverage of Listeria monocytogenes in patients older than 50 or immunocompromised. Listeria accounts for up to 10 of cases in this demographic and omission is associated with a twofold increased risk of treatment failure in both prospective cohort and retrospective analyses. A common misconception is that dual therapy covers all major pathogens however Listeria is intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and requires a beta lactam such as ampicillin. Based on AAN guidelines level A evidence supports triple therapy in patients older than 50 while dual therapy without ampicillin is only recommended in younger adults at low risk for Listeria. Therefore option A is correct and option B is incorrect due to incomplete pathogen coverage.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding bacterial meningitis requires integration of microbiology taxonomy, host anatomy, and clinical risk factors. Bacterial meningitis is defined as infection of the pia arachnoid and subarachnoid space. In ICD 11 bacterial meningitis specific codes are assigned to etiologies for surveillance and epidemiology. In community acquired meningitis in adults the most common pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis and Listeria monocytogenes. The risk of Listeria infection increases with age over 50 immunosuppression or chronic illnesses.\n\nEmbryologically the meninges develop from mesenchymal layers adjacent to the neural tube with the pia and arachnoid derived from the neural crest ectomeninx while the dura derives from mesoderm. The CSF is produced by the choroid plexus epithelium lining the ventricles derived from the neural tube and drains via arachnoid granulations into the venous sinuses.\n\nNeuroanatomically the subarachnoid space surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Bacteria enter via hematogenous spread or direct extension in skull fractures or neurosurgical procedures. The blood brain barrier and blood CSF barrier normally restrict pathogens however once infected inflammatory cytokines increase permeability leading to polymorphonuclear cell influx. Pathogen associated molecular patterns stimulate Toll like receptor signalling on microglia and endothelial cells initiating the inflammatory cascade. Genetic factors such as polymorphisms in genes encoding cytokines can modulate disease severity.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include viral meningitis subarachnoid hemorrhage carcinomatous meningitis and autoimmune meningoencephalitis. Taxonomy has evolved moving from culture dependent classification to molecular based identification using PCR and next generation sequencing which improves pathogen identification and antimicrobial stewardship.","pathophysiology":"In healthy physiology the blood brain barrier tightly regulates entry of cells and solutes into the CSF space maintaining low protein and minimal immune cells. CSF production by the choroid plexus occurs at a rate of approximately 500 milliliters per day and circulates through ventricles into the subarachnoid space before absorption via arachnoid granulations. In bacterial meningitis pathogens replicate within the CSF which has low opsonic activity and minimal complement leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Initial hematogenous seeding occurs when bacteria bind to endothelial cell receptors initiating transcytosis across the blood brain barrier. In addition bacteria may enter from adjacent foci such as sinusitis or otitis media or from direct inoculation in trauma or neurosurgery.\n\nOnce in the subarachnoid space bacteria multiply to densities exceeding 10 000 colony forming units per milliliter. Bacterial cell wall components such as lipoteichoic acid and lipooligosaccharide trigger Toll like receptor mediated activation of microglia and endothelial cells leading to release of pro inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1 tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6. This inflammatory cascade increases blood brain barrier permeability resulting in vasogenic cerebral edema while also causing cytotoxic edema due to impaired autoregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. The resultant increase in intracranial pressure leads to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure and risk of brain herniation.\n\nAntibiotics disrupt bacterial cell wall integrity leading to further release of inflammatory mediators a phenomenon known as antibiotic mediated lysis. Therefore dexamethasone is administered adjunctively to attenuate the inflammatory response and reduce neurologic complications. The addition of ampicillin is crucial in targeting Listeria which employs intracellular survival mechanisms and is resistant to cephalosporins due to low binding affinity at penicillin binding proteins. Vancomycin targets D alanyl D alanine termini of peptidoglycan inhibiting cell wall synthesis and is required for resistant pneumococcal strains while ceftriaxone inhibits transpeptidase activity with high CSF penetration achieving concentrations above four times the MIC for most strains.\n\nTemporal progression typically features acute presentation within hours while subacute presentations may evolve over days in partially treated or immunocompromised patients. Compensatory mechanisms such as CSF absorption increase may transiently maintain intracranial pressure but decompensation occurs rapidly if untreated. Neuronal injury from inflammation and ischemia leads to long term sequelae including hearing loss and cognitive deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute bacterial meningitis presents with a classical triad of fever neck stiffness and altered mental status however this combination occurs in only approximately 45 of adults. Headache is the most consistent symptom reported in over 90 of cases while photophobia phonophobia nausea and vomiting are common. In older adults drowsiness, confusion and lethargy may predominate with fewer signs of meningeal irritation. Seizures occur in 20 of cases particularly with Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nPhysical examination may reveal nuchal rigidity present in around 70 of patients Kernig sign and Brudzinski sign in 50 to 60 though sensitivity is low in elderly. Focal neurologic deficits develop in 20 to 30 such as cranial nerve palsies or hemiparesis often indicating cerebral infarcts due to vasculitis or thrombosis. In severe cases papilledema may be present reflecting increased intracranial pressure.\n\nSubtypes include community acquired nosocomial and posttraumatic meningitis. Neonatal meningitis presents with subtle signs poor feeding irritability and bulging fontanelle while immunocompromised patients may have subacute presentations with fewer meningeal signs.\n\nUntreated mortality approaches 100 within 24 to 48 hours. With treatment mortality rates range from 10 to 30 in developed countries and higher in resource limited settings. Survivors often experience neurologic sequelae with hearing loss occurring in 10 to 20 cognitive impairment seizure disorders and focal deficits.\n\nDiagnostic criteria from IDSA require CSF pleocytosis typically >1000 white blood cells per microliter with neutrophil predominance CSF protein >200 and glucose <40 percent of serum glucose. Gram stain yields sensitivity of 60 to 90 depending on bacterial load and prior antibiotics while culture specificity approaches 100. PCR assays increase diagnostic yield by 20 in partially treated cases. Reliable recognition of presentations in special populations is critical to timely management.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with prompt recognition of suspected meningitis followed by blood cultures and neuroimaging if indicated. The algorithm includes assessment for contraindications to lumbar puncture such as focal neurologic deficits papilledema or impaired consciousness. In such cases a head CT is performed prior to lumbar puncture with a sensitivity of 92 for mass effect detection. Empiric antibiotics should not be delayed for imaging or lumbar puncture.\n\nFirst tier investigations include blood cultures which yield pathogens in 50 to 80 of cases and CSF analysis obtained by lumbar puncture. CSF cell count, protein, glucose and opening pressure are essential with pleocytosis neutrophil predominance protein elevation and hypoglycorrhachia establishing the diagnosis. Gram stain sensitivity is 60 to 90 while culture specificity is near 100. Pretest probability in community acquired meningitis ranges from 2 to 5 depending on local epidemiology altering PPV and NPV of CSF tests.\n\nSecond tier investigations incorporate antigen detection using latex agglutination which has sensitivity 70 to 90 in bacterial meningitis and PCR assays for bacterial DNA which increases diagnostic yield by 15 to 20 in patients previously exposed to antibiotics. CSF lactate measurement with a cutoff >3.5 mmol per liter provides sensitivity of 95 and specificity of 86 for bacterial over viral meningitis.\n\nThird tier investigations include next generation sequencing for pathogen discovery in culture negative cases and CSF cytokine profiling to differentiate inflammatory etiologies. These are primarily research tools and not widely available. Imaging with MRI may identify complications such as abscesses vasculitic infarcts or hydrocephalus.\n\nSelection of tests should balance pretest probability antibiotic exposure and local resource availability. In resource limited settings reliance on CSF cell count and basic biochemistry remains standard. Recognizing false negatives due to prior antibiotics and traumatic lumbar puncture contamination is critical. Repeat lumbar puncture is indicated if clinical deterioration occurs after 48 hours of appropriate therapy.","management_principles":"Empiric antimicrobial therapy must be initiated as soon as possible once bacterial meningitis is suspected ideally within one hour of presentation. The recommended empiric regimen for adults older than 50 years includes vancomycin plus a third generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus ampicillin. Vancomycin dosing of 15 to 20 mg per kilogram every eight to twelve hours aims for trough concentrations of 15 to 20 micrograms per milliliter to ensure adequate CSF penetration. Ceftriaxone is administered at two grams intravenously every twelve hours achieving CSF concentrations four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for most common pathogens. Ampicillin at two grams intravenously every four hours provides optimal coverage for Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nFor patients allergic to beta lactams vancomycin plus moxifloxacin with or without trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole may be used to cover common pathogens including Listeria. Adjunctive dexamethasone at 0.15 mg per kilogram every six hours for four days is recommended before or with the first dose of antibiotics to reduce inflammation and improve neurologic outcomes particularly in suspected pneumococcal meningitis.\n\nDuration of therapy varies by pathogen: Streptococcus pneumoniae typically requires ten to fourteen days of treatment Neisseria meningitidis seven days Haemophilus influenzae type b seven to ten days and Listeria monocytogenes at least twenty one days. Monitoring of renal function and therapeutic drug levels is necessary for vancomycin dosing adjustments. Supportive care includes aggressive fluid management electrolyte correction and intracranial pressure monitoring in intensive care settings.\n\nNon pharmacological interventions include management of complications such as seizures with antiepileptic drugs rehabilitation for neurologic deficits and hearing assessments with audiology referral. In refractory cases neurosurgical intervention may be required for complications such as subdural empyema or hydrocephalus. Multidisciplinary care involving infectious disease neurology critical care and rehabilitation specialists optimizes outcomes.\n\nGuideline recommendations are based on level A evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta analyses. Controversies remain regarding optimal timing of dexamethasone and management of nosocomial cases. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating novel antimicrobial agents and immunomodulatory adjuncts.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow up involves clinical monitoring laboratory evaluation and imaging as indicated to assess treatment response and detect complications. Clinical assessments every eight to twelve hours should document mental status neurologic signs and vital signs. Laboratory monitoring includes complete blood count comprehensive metabolic panel and inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein which decline with effective therapy.\n\nRepeat lumbar puncture is not routinely recommended if the patient demonstrates clinical improvement within 48 hours and CSF cultures were positive at baseline. Indications for repeat lumbar puncture include lack of clinical improvement or deterioration after 48 hours high opening pressure or persistent positive CSF cultures in Gram stain or culture. CSF cell count and biochemistry should trend toward normalization.\n\nNeuroimaging with MRI is indicated in cases with focal neurologic deficits complications such as abscess or when intracranial pressure remains elevated despite therapy. Hearing assessment by audiometry should be performed at two weeks post diagnosis to detect sensorineural hearing loss which occurs in 10 to 20 of survivors.\n\nLong term follow up addresses neurologic sequelae cognitive impairment seizures and quality of life.

What is the appropriate prophylactic antibiotic for close contacts?","options":["Ciprofloxacin"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Ciprofloxacin","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. Ciprofloxacin. Multiple guidelines including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend a single 500 mg oral dose of ciprofloxacin for adult close contacts of a patient with confirmed Neisseria meningitidis infection (Grade A recommendation, Level I evidence)1,2. A single-dose regimen improves compliance compared to four doses of rifampin and avoids the need for intramuscular injection required by ceftriaxone. Ciprofloxacin demonstrates >95% eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage within 24 hours (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.20)3. No other options were provided. Therefore, no analysis of incorrect options is necessary.","conceptual_foundation":"Neisseria meningitidis is a fastidious, aerobic, Gram-negative diplococcus classified within the family Neisseriaceae (ICD-11: FA00.0). Twelve serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, Y, others) are identified by capsular polysaccharide composition; serogroups A, B, C, W, X, and Y cause >90% of invasive disease globally4. Carriage in the nasopharynx occurs in up to 10%\u201320% of healthy adolescents and young adults5. Transmission is via respiratory droplets and close contact; household, daycare, and dormitory settings pose highest risk. The taxonomy evolved from early 20th-century isolation to molecular serogrouping enabled by capsule gene cluster sequencing6. Embryologically, the meninges derive from neural crest and mesodermal mesenchyme; breach of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) by N. meningitidis results in meningeal inflammation. Key neuroanatomical structures include the pia and arachnoid mater surrounding the subarachnoid space, the locus of bacterial proliferation and inflammatory exudate. Inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) disrupt BBB integrity, increase intracranial pressure, and cause cerebral edema7. Genetic susceptibility factors include complement deficiencies (C5\u2013C9) and polymorphisms in TLR4 and factor H binding protein loci8. Phylogenetic studies reveal clonal complexes (e.g., ST-11, ST-41/44) associated with hypervirulent strains9.","pathophysiology":"Normal nasopharyngeal mucosa is colonized by commensal flora; N. meningitidis expresses pili and opacity proteins to adhere to epithelial cells. Phase variation and antigenic variation of pili facilitate immune evasion10. Invasion requires crossing of the mucosal barrier via micro-lesions, followed by survival in the bloodstream by resisting complement-mediated lysis through capsule and factor H binding protein. Bacteremia allows seeding of the subarachnoid space; bacteria cross the BBB via transcellular traversal and paracellular routes facilitated by inflammatory cytokines that loosen tight junctions (VE-cadherin disruption)11. Within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), N. meningitidis multiplies rapidly, releasing lipooligosaccharide (LOS) endotoxin that triggers a massive host inflammatory response. Recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes, release of reactive oxygen species, and release of proteolytic enzymes lead to neuronal injury, increased intracranial pressure, and vasculitic changes in cerebral vessels12. Acute features (fever, headache, neck stiffness) reflect meningeal irritation; septic shock in meningococcemia is mediated by endotoxin-driven cytokine storm. Prophylactic antibiotics eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage, interrupting transmission by eradicating mucosal bacteria without significantly affecting commensal flora.","clinical_manifestation":"Invasive meningococcal disease typically presents with abrupt onset of high fever (>39 \u00b0C), severe headache (90% of cases), nuchal rigidity (75%), photophobia, and altered mental status. A petechial or purpuric rash develops in ~50% of cases, often preceding hypotension in fulminant meningococcemia (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)13. Other signs include Kernig and Brudzinski signs, seizures (20%), and focal neurologic deficits (10%). Onset-to-treatment interval correlates with outcome; delays >24 hours double mortality14. In untreated cases, mortality reaches 70% in meningococcemia and 20% in meningitis15. Subacute (<48 hours) presentations may lack rash in ~30% of children and elderly. Differential includes pneumococcal, Listeria, and viral meningitis; key distinguishing feature is rapid progression and rash. Natural history without treatment is fatal in >50% within 48 hours. Early antibiotic administration reduces fatality to <10%16. Close contacts (household members, daycare contacts, kissing contacts) have a 500\u2013800 fold increased risk within the first week17.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Obtain blood cultures (sensitivity 60%\u201380%), lumbar puncture for CSF analysis including Gram stain (sensitivity 90% for meningococci), culture, and PCR18. CSF typically shows neutrophilic pleocytosis (>1000 cells/mm3), low glucose (<40% serum), high protein (>100 mg/dL). Perform CBC, coagulation profile, serum electrolytes, and inflammatory markers. Second-tier: CSF latex agglutination for capsular antigens (sensitivity 80%, specificity 98%), PCR assays for meningococcal DNA (sensitivity 95%) especially if prior antibiotics19. Third-tier: Whole genome sequencing in outbreak settings, complement deficiency testing in recurrent cases. Pre-test probability in close contacts after index case exposure is ~1:300; post-test probability after negative nasopharyngeal swab PCR falls to <1:10,000. NNT for prophylaxis in close contacts is ~240 to prevent one secondary case20.","management_principles":"Empiric therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis: ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h plus vancomycin, with addition of ampicillin in >50 years or immunocompromised to cover Listeria (Class I, Level A)21. Upon identification of N. meningitidis susceptible to penicillin, switch to penicillin G 4 MU IV q4h or ampicillin. Adjunctive dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg IV q6h for 4 days) reduces hearing loss and neurologic sequelae if given before or with first antibiotic dose (Class I, Level A)22. Prophylaxis for close contacts: rifampin 600 mg PO q12h \u00d74 doses, or single-dose oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg (adults), or ceftriaxone 250 mg IM (adults) (Grade A, Level I)1,2. Ciprofloxacin advantages: single dose, no interaction with rifampin\u2019s CYP induction, well tolerated; contraindicated in pregnancy and children. For pregnant contacts, ceftriaxone IM is preferred. Vaccination with quadrivalent conjugate vaccine (A, C, W, Y) recommended for outbreaks and high-risk individuals.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor all treated patients for at least 48 hours for recurrent fever, neurologic deterioration, and hemodynamic instability. Perform audiology evaluation before discharge and at 3 months to detect hearing loss (occurs in 10%\u201320%)23. In patients with focal deficits or persistent headache, obtain MRI brain to evaluate for abscess or venous thrombosis. Screen for complement deficiencies (CH50, C5\u2013C9) in survivors of recurrent meningococcal disease24.
