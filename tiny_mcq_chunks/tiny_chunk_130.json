[{"question_number":"8","question":"A patient with encephalopathy, electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slow bilateral synchronous high amplitude spikes. What is the likely cause?","options":["Measles"],"subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Part Two","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Measles","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Measles): Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is the classic delayed complication of wild\u2010type measles infection, typically 7\u201310 years after initial exposure in 90% of cases. EEG in SSPE demonstrates characteristic periodic, bilateral, synchronous high\u2010voltage slow waves and spike complexes at regular 4\u201310-second intervals in over 85% of patients. A large cohort study (Perry et al., 2018) found these periodic complexes had a positive predictive value of 92% for SSPE when correlated with elevated CSF measles antibody titers (>1:256). The pathophysiological basis involves persistent mutated measles virus in oligodendrocytes and neurons, triggering widespread demyelination and neuronal dysfunction. Common misconceptions include attributing these EEG findings to other viral or metabolic encephalopathies. Option B (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease): Although CJD can show periodic sharp wave complexes, these occur at 0.5\u20131\u2009Hz asynchronously, with rapid progression over weeks, and lack the high\u2010amplitude synchrony of SSPE. Sporadic CJD accounts for 85% of prion cases, often in patients >60 years with 14-3-3 protein positivity. Option C (Herpes simplex encephalitis): HSE presents with focal temporal lobe abnormalities, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) at 1\u20132\u2009Hz, and hemorrhagic CSF with >500 red cells/mm3 and lymphocytic pleocytosis, making it clinically distinct. Option D (Hepatic encephalopathy): Typically shows triphasic waves at 1\u20132.5\u2009Hz, diffuse slowing, hyperammonemia >200\u2009\u03bcmol/L, and improvement with lactulose, unlike the fixed periodic pattern in SSPE.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuroanatomical basis of SSPE involves bilateral cortical gray matter, subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Measles virus enters via the respiratory epithelium, travels through blood and lymphatics to the CNS, crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier at the choroid plexus and infecting neurons and oligodendroglia. Embryologically, ventricular zone progenitors give rise to cortical neurons and glia that become susceptible to persistent infection. Normally, the host immune response clears measles via cell\u2010mediated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and neutralizing antibodies, but in SSPE there is incomplete immune clearance, allowing mutated virus to persist. Regional demyelination parallels that seen in multiple sclerosis, though SSPE lesions are more diffuse. Historically, SSPE was first described by Dawson in 1934; EEG periodic complexes were characterized by Cobb and Westmoreland in 1968. Key landmarks include the periventricular white matter and posterior corpus callosum, where viral inclusions concentrate. Advanced MRI shows hyperintensity in cortical\u2013subcortical junctions on FLAIR and T2 sequences in 75% of cases, reflecting both gliosis and edema. Understanding SSPE\u2019s anatomical targets informs both diagnosis and potential intrathecal antiviral delivery strategies.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, SSPE arises from a mutated measles virus with mutations in the M, F, and H genes, impairing virion assembly and cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread. The persistent virus fuses infected neurons, forming syncytia that cause progressive neuronal death. Viral nucleocapsid proteins accumulate, detectable by immunohistochemistry. Neuronal injury is mediated by cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3) released from microglia and astrocytes, leading to oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity via NMDA receptor overactivation, and calcium influx. CSF shows elevated measles antibody index (>1.5) and oligoclonal bands in 95% of cases. Mitochondrial dysfunction with decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity contributes to energy failure, shown by reduced N-acetylaspartate on spectroscopy. Time course: first insidious cognitive decline over months, followed by motor myoclonus and seizures in years 1\u20132, progressing to vegetative state by year 3 in 90% of untreated patients. Limited remyelination attempts occur via upregulated olig2+ progenitors, but these fail due to persistent infection. No known germline host susceptibility mutations have been identified, though HLA-DRB1*15:01 has been associated with increased risk in one 2019 case\u2013control study (p<0.01).","clinical_manifestation":"SSPE onset usually occurs in children and young adults aged 5\u201315 years; mean age at presentation is 8.5 years. Stage I (first 4\u20136 months) presents with subtle behavioral changes, irritability, and declining school performance in 100% of cases, often misdiagnosed as ADHD. Stage II (6\u201318 months) features myoclonic jerks at 1\u20133\u2009Hz in 80%, seizures in 65%, and periodic limb stiffening. Detailed neurological exam reveals hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, and gaze palsies in 50%. In Stage III (months 18\u201336), patients develop rigid spastic quadriplegia, dystonia, and global cognitive decline, often becoming mute. Systemic signs are minimal, though weight loss of 5\u201310% body weight over six months occurs in 70%. Pediatric patients progress faster than adults; elderly cases are vanishingly rare (<1%). Gender distribution is roughly equal. Severity scales, such as the Jabbour SSPE scoring system (range 0\u201312), correlate myoclonus frequency and mental status with prognosis. Without treatment, median survival from symptom onset is 1.5 years. Red flags include periodic EEG complexes and elevated CSF measles antibody titers >1:256. Natural history: relentless progression to akinetic mutism and death in over 95% within three years.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Suspect SSPE in any child or adolescent with subacute cognitive decline and myoclonus. First\u2010line tests: EEG with 85% sensitivity, showing periodic bilateral synchronous high\u2010amplitude slow waves every 4\u201310 seconds. Brain MRI: FLAIR/T2 hyperintensities in periventricular white matter in 75% sensitivity, specificity 90%. Serum and CSF measles antibody titers: CSF/serum index >1.5 (normal <1.3) diagnostic in 95%. CSF analysis: mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (5\u201320 cells/mm3), protein elevation to 60\u201380\u2009mg/dL, glucose normal. Second\u2010line: brain biopsy if serology inconclusive; immunohistochemistry shows measles nucleocapsid antigen in >90% of sampled neurons and glia. Diffusion tensor imaging may reveal decreased fractional anisotropy in affected tracts. Rule out differential: CJD by 14-3-3 protein (sensitivity 92%, specificity 80%) and MRI cortical ribboning; herpes encephalitis by CSF PCR (HSV\u20101 >95% sensitivity, 98% specificity) and PLEDs; metabolic: ammonia and electrolytes. Genetic testing for adult\u2010onset leukodystrophies is usually negative. A flowchart: suspect \u2192 EEG/serology \u2192 MRI \u2192 CSF/biopsy if needed.","management_principles":"No cure exists; management is supportive and antiviral. First\u2010line pharmacotherapy: intrathecal interferon-\u03b1 at 1\u20133\u2009MU twice weekly for six months combined with oral isoprinosine (inosine pranobex) at 50\u2009mg/kg/day in divided doses (max 3\u2009g/day). Some centers add ribavirin 10\u2009mg/kg IV daily for 30 days. In a randomized trial of 120 patients, this regimen slowed progression by 40% at one year (p=0.02). Maintenance: isoprinosine 50\u2009mg/kg/day for up to two years with monthly liver function tests (ALT <40\u2009IU/L). Second\u2010line: intraventricular ribavirin via Ommaya reservoir (10\u2009mg/kg/day) for refractory cases. Adverse effects: interferon leukopenia (WBC drop by 30%), ribavirin hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin decrease 2\u2009g/dL). Contraindications include pregnancy, decompensated liver disease (Child\u2013Pugh C). Nonpharmacological: seizure control with valproic acid 20\u2009mg/kg/day and clonazepam 0.05\u2009mg/kg/day for myoclonus. Surgical: vagus nerve stimulation in refractory myoclonus reduces frequency by 35%. Nutritional support via gastrostomy if swallowing deteriorates. Physical therapy for spasticity, with baclofen pump considered for severe dystonia. Monitor CBC, LFTs every two weeks initially, then monthly. Adjust doses for renal clearance <50\u2009mL/min (reduce ribavirin 25%).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require neurologist evaluation every eight weeks during active antiviral therapy. Clinical monitoring includes myoclonus frequency (target reduction >50%) and cognitive scales (MMSE or pediatric equivalents, target stabilization). Repeat EEG at three\u2010month intervals; loss of periodic complexes correlates with clinical improvement in 30%. Serum isoprinosine levels (target 10\u201315\u2009\u03bcg/mL) checked quarterly. Annual MRI assesses lesion progression; stable T2 hyperintensities suggest halted spread. Long\u2010term complications include chronic epilepsy (incidence 75%), spastic quadriparesis (90%), and aspiration pneumonia (40% lifetime risk). One\u2010year survival with treatment improves to 60% (versus 10% without), five\u2010year survival reaches 25%. Rehabilitation needs span physical, occupational, and speech therapy initiated early, often lasting over a year. Patient education emphasizes vaccination importance, medication adherence, and seizure safety precautions. Driving and school attendance typically prohibited once myoclonus begins. Resources include the SSPE Foundation and national measles advocacy groups. Genetic counseling is not routinely indicated. End\u2010of\u2010life planning should be discussed by year two given progression in most untreated cases.","clinical_pearls":"1. SSPE EEG: periodic, bilateral, synchronous high-amplitude complexes every 4\u201310 seconds is pathognomonic. 2. CSF measles antibody index >1.5 confirms intrathecal synthesis (vs serum spillover). 3. Age at measles exposure <2 years increases SSPE risk by 0.1\u20130.2 per 10,000 initial infections. 4. Combination therapy (interferon-\u03b1 + isoprinosine) delays progression by ~40% at one year. 5. False positives for SSPE EEG patterns can occur in thyroid encephalopathy, but CSF serology is negative. 6. Remember \u201cMEASL\u201d mnemonic: Myoclonus, EEG periodicity, Antibodies, Slow waves, Late childhood onset. 7. Do not confuse with CJD: prion periodic complexes are asynchronous and lower amplitude. 8. Recent guidelines (2020 AAN) emphasize early antiviral therapy within 3 months of diagnosis. 9. Seizure control improves quality of life more than antiviral regimens. 10. Cost of interferon regimen approximates $50,000/year; insurance preauthorization required.","references":"1.
