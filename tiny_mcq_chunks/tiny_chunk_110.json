[{"question_number":"6","question":"In the same scenario as the previous question, but with a computed tomography (CT) angiogram not attached, what is the best treatment to achieve full recanalization?","options":["IV tPA","IV heparin","Aspirin and Plavix","IV tPA followed by mechanical thrombectomy ## Page 6"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"IV tPA followed by mechanical thrombectomy","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D: IV tPA (alteplase) followed by mechanical thrombectomy. Randomized trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME) demonstrated that combining IV alteplase with endovascular thrombectomy in large vessel occlusion (LVO) yields highest rates of complete recanalization (modified TICI 2b/3 in >80% vs ~60% with thrombectomy alone) and improved functional outcomes (90-day mRS 0-2 improved by absolute 20\u201325%, NNT \u2248 4). Option A (IV tPA alone) achieves recanalization rates of only 30\u201340% in LVO. Option B (IV heparin) is not recommended in acute ischemic stroke due to increased hemorrhage risk and no benefit (TOAST guidelines class III). Option C (dual antiplatelet therapy) is for minor non-cardioembolic strokes (CHANCE, POINT trials), not acute LVO. Thus, D is the evidence-based best approach for full recanalization in LVO.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute ischemic stroke classification is based on TOAST criteria: large artery atherosclerosis causing LVO falls under the first category. Embryologically, large cerebral vessels derive from neural crest\u2013associated mesenchyme and branchial arch arteries. The arterial supply to the anterior circulation involves the internal carotid and its branches (M1, M2 segments), while collateral flow arises from leptomeningeal anastomoses. Alteplase is a serine protease that catalyzes plasminogen to plasmin, dissolving fibrin. Mechanical thrombectomy engages stent retrievers or aspiration catheters directly at the clot. The molecular target of alteplase is fibrin-bound plasminogen with higher affinity than circulating plasminogen, reducing systemic bleeding risk.  ","pathophysiology":"Normal hemostasis balances clot formation and fibrinolysis. In LVO, plaque rupture or embolism occludes large cerebral arteries, causing focal ischemia. Without reperfusion, intracellular calcium overload triggers excitotoxicity, free radical generation, BBB breakdown, and infarction. IV alteplase accelerates clot dissolution by converting plasminogen to plasmin, restoring microvascular flow. Mechanical thrombectomy physically removes the thrombus from the arterial lumen, rapidly reestablishing perfusion to ischemic penumbra, halting infarct progression. Compared to tPA alone, combined therapy addresses both fibrin-rich thrombi (tPA) and platelet-rich clots or those resistant to lysis (thrombectomy).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with acute focal deficits: hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, aphasia (dominant hemisphere), or hemineglect (non-dominant). LVO typically has NIHSS \u2265 8\u201315. Time window for IV tPA is 4.5 hours; for thrombectomy up to 6 hours (DAWN, DEFUSE-3 extend to 16\u201324 hours with imaging selection). Incomplete recanalization results in persistent deficits; timely dual therapy improves functional independence at 90 days (mRS 0\u20132 in 46% vs 26% with medical therapy alone).","diagnostic_approach":"Immediate noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity ~99%, specificity ~90%). CT angiography confirms LVO with sensitivity 95% and specificity 93%. CT perfusion identifies penumbra/core mismatch. Pre-tPA laboratories include glucose, platelets, INR. Post-imaging door-to-needle \u226460 minutes (AHA/ASA Class I, Level B-R).","management_principles":"Administer IV alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) with 10% bolus then infusion over 1 hour. Initiate thrombectomy if CTA shows proximal anterior circulation occlusion within window and NIHSS \u22656 (Class I, Level A). Monitor BP <180/105 mmHg. Avoid antithrombotics for 24 hours post-tPA.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurochecks every 15 min \u00d72h, every 30 min \u00d76h, hourly until 24h. Repeat CT if neurological deterioration. Initiate secondary prevention: high-intensity statin, manage BP, diabetes. Rehabilitation planning begins early.","clinical_pearls":"1. In LVO, combined IV tPA + thrombectomy yields best outcomes (NNT=2\u20134). 2. Door-to-needle \u226460 min improves functional recovery. 3. CT perfusion can safely extend thrombectomy window to 24h in selected patients. 4. Avoid heparin in acute stroke\u2014no benefit, increased hemorrhage. 5. Persistent hemiplegia despite reperfusion may reflect malignant edema\u2014monitor and manage ICP.","references":"1. Berkhemer OA et al. MR CLEAN Investigators.

International series (Rinkel et al. 1991; van Gijn et al. 2006) show <1% rebleed risk and no underlying aneurysm. After two negative DSAs, no further vascular imaging is required; outpatient follow-up suffices (AHA/ASA 2012).

Epidemiologically, 5\u201310% of all SAH. Differential includes aneurysmal SAH, venous sinus thrombosis, cavernous malformation bleeding.","pathophysiology":"Venous hemorrhage from small perforators around the mesencephalon causes blood to pool anterior to the pons and midbrain. Normal arterial pressure is not reached, explaining low rebleed risk. Cerebrovascular spasm is uncommon (<5%) compared to aneurysmal SAH (30%). Pathophysiology does not involve arterial wall rupture or saccular aneurysm.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with sudden thunderclap headache, neck stiffness, but rarely focal deficits.
