Diagnosis of Schistosomiasis was confirmed by lab workup. What is the best treatment?","options":["Praziquantel","Amphotericin B ## Page 25"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Praziquantel","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. Praziquantel is the anthelmintic of choice for schistosomal infections involving the central nervous system. Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that praziquantel, given at a dose of 20 mg/kg three times daily for one day (or 40 mg/kg in a single dose for Schistosoma mansoni), achieves cure rates above 85% with acceptable safety profiles (WHO, 2022). The drug increases parasite membrane permeability to calcium ions, resulting in paralysis and tegumental damage. Amphotericin B (Option B) is an antifungal polyene that binds ergosterol in fungal cell membranes; it has no activity against trematode parasites and is therefore incorrect. No trials support amphotericin B in schistosomiasis, and its toxicities (nephrotoxicity, infusion reactions) preclude use in this setting.","conceptual_foundation":"Schistosomiasis is caused by trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma; neuroschistosomiasis arises when eggs or rarely adult worms lodge in the spinal cord or brain vasculature. According to ICD-11, schistosomiasis falls under BA60.0x (Schistosoma \u200amansoni infection, etc.). Differential diagnoses of eosinophilic meningoradiculitis include angiostrongyliasis, gnathostomiasis, and Toxocara canis infection. Historically, antimonials were used before praziquantel\u2019s introduction in the 1970s; over time praziquantel supplanted older regimens due to superior efficacy. Spinal involvement typically localizes to the lower thoracic cord and conus medullaris due to venous plexus drainage patterns.","pathophysiology":"Normal venous drainage of the spinal cord via Batson\u2019s plexus can allow schistosome eggs to embolize to the conus medullaris and lower cord. Eggs elicit a granulomatous inflammatory response with eosinophil-rich infiltrates, disrupting the blood\u2013spinal cord barrier. Praziquantel disrupts schistosome calcium homeostasis, leading to tetanic contraction and parasite death; this halts further egg deposition and antigen release. In contrast, amphotericin B targets ergosterol in fungal membranes\u2014a mechanism absent in trematodes\u2014explaining its inefficacy.","clinical_manifestation":"Neuroschistosomiasis typically presents weeks to months after initial infection with lower limb radiculopathy, back pain, sensory deficits, and bladder dysfunction. CSF shows eosinophilic pleocytosis (often >10 cells/\u00b5L with >10% eosinophils), elevated protein, and normal to low glucose. MRI commonly demonstrates T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancement of the conus and cauda equina nerve roots. Without treatment, progressive myeloradiculopathy can result in irreversible deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes MRI of the spine with contrast (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90% for neuroschistosomiasis) and CSF analysis. Serologic assays (ELISA for anti-Schistosoma antibodies) have sensitivity 90\u201395% and specificity 80\u201390%. Stool and urine microscopy for eggs can be insensitive in neuroschistosomiasis (<50% positive). Praziquantel should be initiated once imaging and CSF eosinophilia suggest schistosomal involvement, without waiting for parasitological confirmation.","management_principles":"Praziquantel is dosed at 20 mg/kg orally every 8 hours for one day (total 60 mg/kg) or 40 mg/kg as a single dose, per WHO guidelines (2022, Level A). Adjunctive corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 0.3 mg/kg/day) for 7\u201314 days reduce inflammatory damage and swelling around the cord (small RCTs, Level B). No role exists for amphotericin B. Supportive measures include physiotherapy for residual deficits.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes clinical neurologic exams at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment. Repeat MRI at 3 months should show resolution or improvement of T2 hyperintensities. CSF cell counts and protein typically normalize over 2\u20133 months. Persisting or worsening symptoms warrant repeat imaging, serologic titers, and consideration of retreatment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Neuroschistosomiasis often localizes to the conus medullaris due to venous drainage via Batson\u2019s plexus. 2. Eosinophilic pleocytosis in CSF strongly suggests parasitic CNS infection\u2014praziquantel is first-line for schistosomiasis. 3. Amphotericin B has no utility against trematodes and should not be used. 4. Adjunctive steroids reduce cord edema and prevent permanent deficits. 5. MRI with contrast is very sensitive for detecting spinal granulomas and myelitis.","references":"1. World Health Organization.

Her family took her to a psychiatrist who prescribed antipsychotics. After that, her condition worsened and she became unresponsive. electroencephalogram (EEG) showed periodic bursts. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed large areas of a signal (diffuse cortical/subcortical) process.

SSPE is a progressive, fatal, late complication of measles infection, typically occurring in children and adolescents several years after acute measles. Clinically it presents with subtle behavioral changes, cognitive decline, myoclonic jerks, and eventually akinetic mutism. The characteristic EEG finding is periodic, bilaterally synchronous high-voltage complexes every 4\u201310 seconds (Alper\u2019s complexes), and MRI shows diffuse cortical and subcortical white-matter hyperintensities. Option A (neuroleptic malignant syndrome) presents with fever, rigidity, autonomic instability, and elevated CK after neuroleptic exposure, but without periodic EEG complexes or demyelinating MRI changes. Option B (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is exceedingly rare in children, has much more rapid progression, and EEG shows periodic sharp wave complexes at ~1 Hz but MRI shows basal ganglia diffusion restriction rather than diffuse white-matter lesions. Option D (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) occurs in immunosuppressed patients, presents with focal deficits, and MRI shows multifocal subcortical demyelinating lesions without periodic EEG bursts.","conceptual_foundation":"SSPE is caused by persistent mutant measles virus in the central nervous system. In ICD-11 it is classified under \u2018Viral encephalitides\u2019 (Code 1F80.0). The nosology evolved from early case series in the 1930s to virologic confirmation in the 1960s. Differential diagnoses include CJD, viral encephalitis, leukodystrophies, and autoimmune encephalitis. Measles virus is a paramyxovirus with negative-sense RNA; neurovirulence arises from mutations in the matrix protein gene, leading to cell-to-cell spread without extracellular virion formation. Neuropathologically, there is panencephalitis with neuronal loss, gliosis, and demyelination in subcortical and cortical white matter.","pathophysiology":"Normal measles infection is cleared by a robust cellular immune response. In SSPE, mutated measles virus persists in neurons and glia, evading cytotoxic T cells. The defective M (matrix) protein prevents virion assembly, resulting in slow, cell-to-cell spread. Chronic CNS infection triggers inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and complement activation, causing oligodendrocyte injury and demyelination. Myoclonic jerks correspond to hyperexcitable cortical networks influenced by loss of inhibitory interneurons. Over time, widespread demyelination and neuronal loss lead to the akinetic-mutic end stage.","clinical_manifestation":"SSPE typically presents 7\u201310 years after measles infection in children aged 5\u201315, with initial behavioral changes (e.g., irritability, poor school performance), cognitive decline, and progressive myoclonic jerks in 75% of cases. Ocular signs (optic atrophy, retinitis) occur in ~50%. The disease progresses through four stages: prodrome (mild behavioral changes), myoclonic stage (myoclonus, dementia), akinetic stage (rigidity, autonomic disturbance), and terminal stage (coma). Without treatment, median survival is 1\u20133 years after symptom onset.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnosis is based on clinical features plus: (1) EEG showing periodic complexes every 4\u201310 seconds (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~80%); (2) elevated anti-measles antibody titers in CSF (CSF:serum ratio >1:625); (3) characteristic MRI with T2 hyperintensities in white matter. First-line testing includes EEG and CSF measles IgG. Brain biopsy is reserved for atypical cases. PCR for measles RNA in CSF is supportive but less sensitive.","management_principles":"There is no cure. Antiviral therapy (intrathecal/intravenous interferon-\u03b1 plus oral isoprinosine) may slow progression in early stages, with some studies showing 20\u201330% stabilization over 1 year. Symptomatic management includes anticonvulsants (valproate, clonazepam) for myoclonus and supportive care. Emerging therapies under investigation include ribavirin and novel immunomodulators.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require frequent neurological assessments every 1\u20133 months to monitor myoclonus, cognitive function, and autonomic signs. EEG may be repeated quarterly to track evolving periodic complexes. CSF antibody titers can be trended every 6 months to gauge disease activity. Multidisciplinary palliative care and physical/occupational therapy should be initiated early.","clinical_pearls":"1) Periodic EEG complexes every 4\u201310 seconds in a child with cognitive decline is virtually pathognomonic for SSPE. 2) SSPE arises years after measles\u2014check vaccination history. 3) High CSF measles IgG titer (ratio >1:625) confirms intrathecal antibody synthesis. 4) No curative treatment exists; early interferon-\u03b1 + isoprinosine may slow progression. 5) SSPE incidence has dropped >99% in countries with >95% measles vaccination coverage.","references":"1.
