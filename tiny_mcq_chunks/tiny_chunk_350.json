A. Alpha-galactosidase A deficiency causes Fabry disease, characterized by angiokeratomas and neuropathic pain, not neonatal macroglossia or hypotonia. B. Glycogen phosphorylase (myophosphorylase) deficiency causes McArdle disease with exercise intolerance in older children/adults, not neonatal hypotonia. C. The generic term \u201cphosphorylase\u201d without specification usually refers to muscle or liver glycogen phosphorylases, neither of which cause the neonatal presentation described.","conceptual_foundation":"Pompe disease (GSD II) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to deficiency of acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase, leading to accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes throughout muscle, especially cardiac and skeletal muscle. Clinically presents in infancy with cardiomegaly, macroglossia, profound hypotonia (\u201cfloppy baby\u201d), and feeding difficulties. The disorder is classified under ICD-11: 5C60.0 and falls within neuromuscular metabolic myopathies.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase degrades lysosomal glycogen. In Pompe disease, deficiency leads to intralysosomal glycogen accumulation, cellular vacuolization, autophagic build-up, and muscle fiber destruction. Cardiac muscle involvement leads to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; skeletal muscle involvement leads to hypotonia and weakness. Macroglossia arises from glycogen-laden myocytes in tongue.","clinical_manifestation":"Infantile-onset Pompe presents by 3\u20136 months with hypotonia, cardiomegaly (heart failure), feeding difficulty, respiratory insufficiency, and macroglossia. Untreated infants rarely survive beyond 1 year. Laboratory findings include elevated creatine kinase and transaminases. Echocardiography reveals ventricular hypertrophy.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is by measurement of acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase activity in dried blood spot or leukocytes (sensitivity/specificity > 95%) and confirmed by GAA gene sequencing. Muscle biopsy shows vacuolated fibers with PAS-positive glycogen. Newborn screening panels often include Pompe enzyme assay.","management_principles":"Definitive treatment is enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GAA (alglucosidase alfa) dosed at 20 mg/kg biweekly. Early initiation in infancy improves survival and motor outcomes. Supportive care includes respiratory support and nutrition. Cardiac function must be monitored.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow patients every 3 months with cardiac echocardiography, pulmonary function tests, and motor assessments. Monitor for infusion reactions. Long-term survivors require multidisciplinary care including physical therapy and nutrition support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Infantile Pompe presents with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and macroglossia. 2. Newborn screening can identify Pompe disease pre-symptomatically. 3. ERT improves survival but does not fully reverse skeletal myopathy. 4. Always confirm enzyme assay with genetic testing. 5. Lysosomal myopathies require multidisciplinary management.","references":"1. Kishnani PS, et al. Lancet. 2007;369(9529):223-31. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60115-X\n2. Hirschhorn R, Reuser AJJ.

In acute hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoKPP) attacks, immediate administration of oral (or if needed intravenous) potassium chloride aborts the paralytic episode by restoring serum potassium to normal. Options A (spironolactone) and B (acetazolamide) are used prophylactically to prevent attacks by altering renal potassium handling or pH, not for acute correction. Option D (none of the above) is incorrect because potassium is the established therapy. Trials and case series report symptom relief within 30\u201360 minutes after 0.5\u20131 mEq/kg of potassium chloride (up to 60 mEq total), with minimal risk of rebound hyperkalemia when administered under monitoring.","conceptual_foundation":"HypoKPP is an ion channel disorder (ICD-11: 8A64.1) caused by mutations in CACNA1S or SCN4A, leading to aberrant skeletal muscle sarcolemmal excitability. It presents with episodic flaccid paralysis and serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L during attacks. Differential includes thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, Andersen\u2013Tawil syndrome, and familial hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. The taxonomy evolved after identification of channelopathy genes in the 1990s.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle action potentials require proper functioning of voltage-gated calcium and sodium channels. Mutations in CACNA1S (calcium channel \u03b11-subunit) or SCN4A (sodium channel \u03b1-subunit) cause an aberrant gating pore current, leading to depolarization-induced inactivation of channels. Hypokalemia further hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential leading to inexcitability and muscle weakness. Rapid potassium repletion restores the extracellular gradient, repolarizes the membrane, and terminates the attack.","clinical_manifestation":"Attacks begin in adolescence or early adulthood, precipitated by carbohydrate load, rest after exercise, or stress. Flaccid paralysis affects proximal muscles more severely; bulbar and respiratory muscles are less commonly involved. Episodes last hours to days. Interictal weakness is minimal. Laboratory shows low serum potassium during attacks with normal acid\u2013base status. Thyroid function is normal in familial HypoKPP.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: serum electrolytes during attack; confirm hypokalemia. EKG for U waves and arrhythmias. Second-tier: genetic testing for CACNA1S/SCN4A. Third-tier: long exercise test or provocative tests (glucose load) in equivocal cases. Pretest probability is high with episodic flaccid paralysis and documented hypokalemia.","management_principles":"Acute: oral potassium chloride 0.5\u20131 mEq/kg in divided doses; IV only if severe or unable to take orally, under ECG and serum K monitoring. Prophylaxis: acetazolamide 250\u2013500 mg daily or potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone 25\u2013100 mg daily). Avoid high-carbohydrate meals and strenuous exercise. Monitor serum potassium to avoid hyperkalemia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular neuromuscular follow-up every 6\u201312 months. Monitor electrolytes, renal function, and ECG if on diuretic prophylaxis. Genetic counseling for families. Lifestyle advice regarding diet and exercise triggers.","clinical_pearls":"1. Acute HypoKPP responds rapidly to oral potassium (0.5\u20131 mEq/kg). 2. Avoid IV potassium bolus to prevent rebound hyperkalemia. 3. Preventive acetazolamide works by mild acidosis increasing serum K. 4. Mutations in CACNA1S account for ~60% of cases. 5.

First described in 2001, MuSK MG changed the understanding of seronegative MG subsets.","pathophysiology":"Anti\u2010MuSK antibodies (IgG4 subclass) disrupt agrin\u2010Lrp4\u2010MuSK signaling complex at the motor endplate, leading to disassembly of postsynaptic AChR clustering. Unlike AChR MG, complement activation is minimal; instead, interference with MuSK signaling causes neuromuscular transmission failure and secondary muscle fiber atrophy, especially in bulbar muscles.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients frequently present with severe bulbar and neck extensor weakness, dysphagia, dysarthria, and pronounced tongue atrophy with fasciculations. Respiratory crises may be more common. Limb weakness tends to be symmetrical and proximal, but overt atrophy and fasciculations are rare in AChR MG and characteristic in MuSK MG.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis includes clinical evaluation, nerve conduction studies with repetitive stimulation (decrement), single\u2010fiber EMG (increased jitter), and serologic testing for anti\u2010MuSK antibodies (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~99%).

Which channel is likely affected?","options":["Sodium channel","Potassium channel","Calcium channel","Chloride channel"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Sodium channel","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Sodium channel. Cold-induced weakness is characteristic of paramyotonia congenita due to gain-of-function mutations in the SCN4A gene encoding Nav1.4 channels. These mutations cause impaired inactivation at low temperatures, leading to membrane depolarization block and transient weakness. Option B (potassium channel) is seen in periodic paralysis but typically hypokalemic or hyperkalemic variants not specifically cold-induced. Option C (calcium channel) is linked to hypokalemic periodic paralysis and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility but not cold-sensitive weakness. Option D (chloride channel) causes myotonia congenita, which presents with stiffness rather than transient weakness.","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita is a non-dystrophic skeletal muscle channelopathy under ICD-11 muscular channelopathies. It follows an autosomal dominant inheritance. SCN4A mutations alter fast inactivation kinetics of Nav1.4, especially at lower temperatures. Differential includes myotonia congenita, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, and congenital myasthenic syndromes. Embryologically, Nav1.4 is expressed in skeletal muscle beginning in mid-gestation and transitions from Nav1.5. Pathognomonic features include cold-induced episodic stiffness progressing to weakness.","pathophysiology":"Nav1.4 channels mediate the rapid upstroke of the skeletal muscle action potential. Mutations impair fast inactivation, causing persistent sodium inward current and membrane depolarization. At low temperatures, inactivation kinetics slow further, exacerbating depolarization block. The depolarized membrane is inexcitable, manifesting as transient weakness following myotonia. Compensatory mechanisms include Na+/K+ ATPase upregulation over repeated exposures, explaining some adaptation with warming.","clinical_manifestation":"Paramyotonia presents in infancy or early childhood with muscle stiffness (myotonia) upon exposure to cold or repeated activity, followed by muscle weakness lasting minutes to hours. Facial muscles including eyelids can be involved, leading to mask-like facies during attacks. Unlike chloride channel myotonia, there is no warm-up phenomenon; instead repeated cold exposures worsen stiffness and weakness. CK may be modestly elevated. The course is non-progressive.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: EMG at room temperature and cold-exposed (15\u00b0C) muscle showing failure of repetitive discharges and development of electrical silence consistent with depolarization block. Genetic testing for SCN4A mutations confirms diagnosis (sensitivity ~90%). Serum potassium can rise transiently during attacks. Second-tier: in vitro patch-clamp of patient-derived myotubes (research use). Muscle biopsy is normal.","management_principles":"Avoid cold exposure and vigorous exercise in cold. Mexiletine (Class IIa, Level B) reduces myotonia but may not prevent weakness; ranolazine has shown benefit in small series. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide may stabilize membrane potential by causing mild acidosis. Educate on gradual warming strategies and protective clothing in cold environments.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neuromuscular follow-up every 12 months to monitor symptom control and medication tolerance. Assess ECG if on sodium channel blockers. Counsel on cold avoidance and provide action plan for attacks.","clinical_pearls":"1. Paramyotonia worsens with repeat activity in cold\u2014paradoxical to warm-up phenomenon. 2. SCN4A mutations increase persistent sodium current. 3. EMG with cold exposure differentiates sodium vs chloride channel myotonia. 4. Acetazolamide may help by inducing metabolic acidosis. 5. Avoid succinylcholine in anesthesia due to risk of exaggerated myotonia/weakness.","references":"1. Jurkat-Rott K, et al. Sodium channel myotonias and periodic paralysis.
