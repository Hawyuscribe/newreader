What is the next appropriate test?","options":["EEG","CTA","Echocardiogram","Holter monitor"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"EEG","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (EEG) is correct because in the setting of acute subdural hematoma with no new hemorrhage on follow\u2010up CT and new focal neurologic decline (left\u2010sided weakness, decreased consciousness), nonconvulsive status epilepticus must be excluded. Continuous EEG monitoring is the standard to detect subclinical seizures in critically ill patients with an incidence up to 8% in neuro\u2010ICU cohorts (Claassen et al., Neurology 2013). Options B\u2013D (CTA, echocardiogram, Holter) do not detect ongoing cortical electrical abnormalities.","conceptual_foundation":"Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is defined in ILAE 2015 classification as a \u226530-minute electrographic seizure without prominent motor manifestations. In postoperative neurosurgical patients, the risk of NCSE is heightened by cortical irritation from hemorrhage and surgery. NCSE can manifest as altered mental status and focal deficits (Todd\u2019s paralysis) lasting beyond 30 minutes.","pathophysiology":"After subdural hematoma evacuation, cortical irritation and neuronal hyperexcitability can initiate synchronized discharges. In NCSE, glutamatergic NMDA receptor-mediated excitation overwhelms GABAergic inhibition, leading to sustained electrical seizure activity without convulsions, causing metabolic exhaustion and secondary neuronal injury.","clinical_manifestation":"NCSE often presents as unexplained encephalopathy, fluctuating consciousness, new focal deficits, or subtle motor phenomena. Up to 10% of comatose ICU patients have NCSE. Todd\u2019s paralysis\u2014transient postictal weakness\u2014can mimic stroke or hematoma expansion.","diagnostic_approach":"Continuous or at least 30\u2010minute EEG should be obtained promptly. Sensitivity for NCSE detection increases from 60% on routine EEG to >90% with prolonged monitoring. Pretest probability is high in neurosurgical patients with new deficits and stable imaging.","management_principles":"If EEG confirms NCSE, initiate benzodiazepine (lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV) followed by IV antiseizure agents (levetiracetam 1\u20133 g IV load; valproate 20\u201340 mg/kg). Per Neurocritical Care Society guidelines (2015), treatment should aim to terminate electrographic seizures within 60 minutes.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat EEG monitoring for at least 24 hours after seizure cessation. Monitor antiseizure drug levels and adjust dosing. Neurological examinations every 1\u20132 hours. Evaluate for provokable causes (electrolyte disturbances, infection).","clinical_pearls":"1) Always consider NCSE in neurosurgical patients with new neurologic decline and stable imaging. 2) EEG is the only way to diagnose NCSE; CT/MRI are nondiagnostic. 3) Todd\u2019s paralysis can persist for hours and mimic hematoma re\u2010expansion. 4) Early antiseizure treatment reduces neuronal injury and improves outcomes (NNT\u22483). 5) cEEG monitoring should be continued 24\u201348 hours post\u2010treatment.","references":"1.

Benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) is most commonly caused by heterozygous mutations in the KCNQ2 gene on chromosome 20q13.3, encoding the Kv7.2 subunit of the M-current potassium channel. Option B (KCNQ3) also causes BFNE but less frequently. Option C (SCN1A) is associated with Dravet syndrome, characterized by febrile seizures and multiple seizure types, not benign self\u2010limited neonatal seizures. Option D (CDKL5) mutations cause early\u2010onset epileptic encephalopathy with severe developmental impairment and refractory seizures.","conceptual_foundation":"BFNE is an autosomal dominant neonatal epilepsy syndrome characterized by focal clonic or tonic seizures starting in the first week of life, resolving spontaneously by 3\u20136 months, with normal development thereafter. It is classified under neonatal epilepsies in ILAE and ICD\u201011. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes were first linked in 1998 (Singh et al., Nat Genet).","pathophysiology":"KCNQ2 encodes Kv7.2 channel subunits that generate the neuronal M-current, important for regulating excitability. Loss\u2010of\u2010function mutations reduce M-current, leading to hyperexcitability of cortical neurons and neonatal seizures. Compensation by KCNQ3 expression over months accounts for spontaneous remission.","clinical_manifestation":"Seizures are focal clonic or tonic movements, often with autonomic features, occurring multiple times per day in clusters. Interictal EEG may show focal spikes or be normal. Development is entirely normal after remission.

In focal epilepsy, a homogeneous clinical presentation with a single seizure type correlates with a more localized and less diffuse epileptogenic network, conferring better seizure control and remission rates. Multiple prognostic studies (e.g., Berg et al. 2008 meta-analysis) demonstrate that patients with only one seizure type have a 30% higher likelihood of long-term seizure freedom compared to those with polymorphic presentations. Options B, C, and D indicate longer disease burden, abnormal imaging, and short remission\u2014each independently associated with poorer outcomes in focal epilepsy and thus incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Focal epilepsies are classified under ILAE 2017 as epilepsies of focal onset, further subdivided by etiology (structural, genetic, metabolic, immune, infectious, or unknown). Prognostic factors inform decisions on duration of therapy and surgical referral. Differential diagnoses include generalized epilepsies and PNES. Nosologically, one seizure type implies a discrete focus without secondary generalization, historically termed simple partial epilepsy in older classifications (1981 ILAE).","pathophysiology":"A single seizure type reflects a stable epileptogenic zone with limited network involvement. In contrast, multiple seizure types suggest secondary spread to multiple cortical areas or bilateral networks, involving GABAergic and glutamatergic dysfunction across wider circuits. MRI-visible lesions (e.g., nonspecific white matter changes) imply diffuse pathology, increasing the likelihood of multiple seizure phenotypes through interconnected brain regions.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with a single seizure type often report consistent auras or motor events localized to one body region. They typically have stable ictal semiology, brief postictal phases, and lower rates of secondary generalization (<20% over 5 years). In contrast, patients with multiple seizure types exhibit varied motor, sensory, or autonomic features, higher frequency of status epilepticus, and more treatment-resistant disease.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes detailed history to ascertain seizure types and video-EEG monitoring to confirm homogeneity of events. Structural MRI with epilepsy protocol rules out lesions, as nonspecific white matter changes carry low localizing value. Extended ambulatory EEG may document additional subclinical seizure types in polymorphic cases, guiding prognosis.","management_principles":"Monotherapy with a first-line AED (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or levetiracetam) achieves remission in up to 70% of patients with a single seizure type. In polymorphic seizures or when structural lesions are present, earlier consideration of polytherapy or surgical evaluation is warranted. Duration of AED treatment can be shorter (2 years seizure-free) in homogeneous seizure types versus longer in mixed presentations.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 6 months assess seizure recurrence, side effects, and treatment adherence. MRI should be repeated if new seizure types emerge. Consider tapering AEDs after two years of seizure freedom in patients with a single seizure type and normal imaging, per AAN guidelines (Level B).","clinical_pearls":"1. Monomorphic focal seizures predict better prognosis. 2. Multiple seizure types often indicate secondary network spread and warrant early specialist referral. 3. Nonspecific MRI findings are poor prognostic markers\u2014normal imaging portends better outcome. 4. Remission criteria differ by seizure heterogeneity. 5. Detailed semiologic analysis is critical for prognosis and management planning.","references":"1. Berg AT, Shinnar S, Levy SR, Testa FM.

Cyanosis during an event strongly favors a seizure over syncope, as tonic-clonic seizures often involve apnea and oxygen desaturation, leading to generalized cyanosis. In contrast, syncope typically causes pallor, not cyanosis, because cerebral hypoperfusion occurs with maintained peripheral circulation. Studies (e.g., Sheldon et al. 2002) show that cyanotic skin changes have a positive predictive value of 92% for epileptic seizures versus syncopal episodes.","conceptual_foundation":"The differentiation between syncope and seizure is grounded in their pathophysiological mechanisms: syncope results from transient global cerebral hypoperfusion, whereas seizures are due to paroxysmal neuronal hyperactivity. ILAE classifies syncope as non-epileptic spells. Key clinical features that differentiate seizures include tongue biting, postictal confusion, and autonomic phenomena such as cyanosis. Historical descriptions by Sir William Gowers emphasized cyanosis as an ictal sign.","pathophysiology":"In generalized tonic-clonic seizures, sustained tonic contraction of respiratory muscles and central apnea occur, leading to rapid hypoxemia and cyanosis. Neuronal hyperexcitability in brainstem respiratory centers exacerbates respiratory arrest. Conversely, in syncope, hypotension triggers peripheral vasodilation and pallor without significant hypoxia, because breathing continues unimpeded.","clinical_manifestation":"During tonic-clonic seizures, cyanosis is observed in up to 80% of patients within seconds of onset. It is often accompanied by perioral dusky discoloration. Other features favoring seizure include tongue biting (50%), urinary incontinence (30%), and postictal confusion (70%). Prodromal presyncope symptoms (lightheadedness, nausea) are absent in ictal events.","diagnostic_approach":"Video-EEG remains the gold standard to distinguish seizures from syncope. Tilt-table testing can reproduce vasovagal syncope in uncertain cases. Pulse oximetry during events will show desaturation (<90%) in seizures. ECG and Holter monitoring rule out arrhythmic syncope when cyanosis is absent.","management_principles":"Recognition of cyanosis as an ictal sign guides timely initiation of appropriate AED therapy instead of cardiovascular interventions. In newly diagnosed generalized tonic-clonic seizures, valproate or levetiracetam is first-line. Conversely, syncope management focuses on addressing hypotension and arrhythmias, so misclassification has significant treatment implications.","follow_up_guidelines":"After a first generalized seizure with documented cyanosis, follow-up within 1 month is recommended to assess for recurrence and tolerability of AEDs. Pulse oximetry and EEG monitoring may be repeated if the diagnosis remains uncertain. Long-term follow-up every 6\u201312 months evaluates seizure control and side effects.","clinical_pearls":"1. Cyanosis during transient loss of consciousness strongly suggests seizure over syncope. 2. Pallor without cyanosis points to vasovagal syncope. 3. Postictal confusion differentiates seizure from syncope. 4. Pulse oximetry desaturation <90% during an event is a reliable ictal marker. 5. Early recognition prevents unnecessary cardiac work-ups.","references":"1. Sheldon R, Rose S, Ritchie D, et al. Historical criteria that distinguish syncope from seizures.

An HIV test (option A) and EEG (option B) do not address the underlying hydrocephalus or raised intracranial pressure and are therefore incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Transependymal edema on MRI indicates elevated intraventricular pressure. Papilledema and seizures reflect intracranial hypertension rather than a primary seizure disorder or infectious seroconversion. Immediate neurosurgical evaluation for CSF diversion (e.g., shunt) is indicated.","pathophysiology":"Obstruction or impaired CSF absorption leads to ventricular dilation. Increased intraventricular pressure drives fluid across the ependyma into brain parenchyma, causing vasogenic edema and elevated ICP, which in turn precipitates headache, visual changes, and seizures.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with progressive headache over weeks to months, nausea, vomiting, papilledema, cognitive changes, and acute seizures as pressure acutely rises on chronic hydrocephalus.","diagnostic_approach":"Neuroimaging (CT/MRI) confirms hydrocephalus.
