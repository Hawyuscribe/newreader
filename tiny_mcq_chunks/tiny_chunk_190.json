Debulking surgery. A \"fried egg\" appearance on histology (perinuclear halo) is characteristic of oligodendroglioma. Standard initial management of a suspected oligodendroglioma is maximal safe surgical resection (debulking) to reduce mass effect and obtain tissue diagnosis (Niinim\u00e4ki et al. 2019). Postoperative therapy (radiotherapy with PCV chemotherapy) depends on molecular markers (1p/19q co-deletion, IDH mutation).\n\nOption A (Chemotherapy) and B (Radiotherapy) are important adjuvant therapies but are administered after resection. Option C (Gamma knife surgery) is reserved for small, inaccessible metastases or recurrent lesions, not first-line for diffuse gliomas.","conceptual_foundation":"Oligodendrogliomas are WHO grade II\u2013III infiltrative gliomas defined by IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion in the 2021 WHO CNS tumor classification.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Chordoma","Osteohistosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Chordoma","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Chordoma. Chordomas arise from notochordal remnants and classically involve the clivus cranially. They present as midline, cystic or destructive lesions with bone erosion, often protruding into the nasal cavity. Osteohistosis (Langerhans cell histiocytosis) can involve bone but typically affects pediatric patients, causes punched-out lytic skull lesions rather than a cystic clival mass, and does not present with a nasal mass protruding from the nostril. Imaging of chordoma on MRI shows T2 hyperintense, lobulated midline lesion with bone destruction; biopsy demonstrates physaliphorous cells positive for cytokeratin and brachyury, confirming notochordal origin.","conceptual_foundation":"Chordomas are low-to-intermediate grade malignant tumors derived from embryonic notochord remnants. In the current WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system (2021), chordomas are categorized as bone tumors of the axial skeleton. They most commonly occur in the sacrum (50\u201360%) and clivus (30\u201335%). Differential diagnoses include chondrosarcoma, meningioma, metastasis, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Embryologically, the notochord forms the axial support structure and normally regresses, leaving the nucleus pulposus. Failure of regression explains the midline location of chordomas. The tumor\u2019s histology includes physaliphorous (vacuolated) cells in a myxoid matrix, immunoreactive for cytokeratin, EMA, and brachyury (a transcription factor essential for notochord development).","pathophysiology":"Normal notochord provides structural signaling to surrounding mesenchyme. In chordoma, neoplastic transformation of notochordal cells leads to unregulated cell proliferation, secretion of mucinous matrix, and local bone destruction via matrix metalloproteinases. The tumor\u2019s myxoid stroma allows cystic degeneration, contributing to mass effect. Progressive growth at the clivus compresses adjacent structures, including the abducens nerve at Dorello\u2019s canal, causing bilateral sixth-nerve palsies. Chronic elevation of intracranial pressure due to mass effect leads to papilledema. Molecular studies identify brachyury gene amplification and PDGFR expression, which are under investigation as therapeutic targets.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with clival chordoma typically present in the 4th\u20136th decades with headache, diplopia from abducens palsy (often bilateral), dysphagia, or cranial neuropathies (III\u2013VI). On examination, papilledema may be present if intracranial pressure is elevated. Epistaxis or a visible mass at the nostril is seen when the lesion extends inferiorly through the sphenoid sinus. Natural history without treatment is progressive neurological decline, cranial nerve deficits, and eventual brainstem compression with high morbidity.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes MRI brain with and without contrast demonstrating a lobulated, T2 hyperintense midline lesion centered in the clivus with bone destruction on CT. CT is superior to assess bony erosion. Definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy, often endoscopically via a nasal approach. Immunohistochemistry showing cytokeratin+, EMA+, and brachyury+ cells distinguishes chordoma from chondrosarcoma (S100+ but brachyury\u2013).","management_principles":"The mainstay of treatment is maximal safe surgical resection, ideally via endoscopic endonasal approach for clival tumors, followed by high-dose proton beam radiotherapy to reduce local recurrence. Conventional photon radiation is less effective due to radioresistance. Medical therapy is investigational; inhibitors targeting PDGFR, EGFR, and brachyury are under study. Recurrence occurs in over 50% of cases without adjuvant radiotherapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI every 6 months for the first 2 years, then annually for at least 10 years, given the high recurrence risk. Monitor neurological function, especially cranial nerve deficits. Lifelong surveillance is recommended. Interval imaging may be shortened if new symptoms arise.","clinical_pearls":"1. Chordomas are midline clival or sacral masses arising from notochord remnants. 2. Bilateral abducens palsy is highly suggestive of clival involvement. 3. Brachyury immunohistochemistry is pathognomonic. 4. Endoscopic endonasal resection plus proton beam therapy offers best local control. 5. Lifelong imaging follow-up is essential due to high recurrence risk.","references":["1. McMaster ML, Goldstein AM, Bromley CM, Ishibe N, Parry DM.

Pilocytic astrocytomas of the optic pathway occur almost exclusively in children with NF1, presenting with proptosis, decreased extraocular movements, and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots. They are WHO grade I, slow-growing, with 5-year progression-free survival >80% when managed conservatively. Imaging shows fusiform enlargement of the nerve with kinking rather than infiltrative mass. Misconceptions include equating any optic nerve tumor with high\u2010grade malignancy; however, benign gliomas in NF1 lack contrast enhancement and show indolent growth (North American Pediatric Neuro\u2010Oncology Consortium 2021). Option B (Malignant optic glioblastoma): Glioblastoma of the optic nerve is exceedingly rare. It would present in adults with rapid vision loss, extensive perineural invasion, ring enhancement on MRI, and poor prognosis (median survival <12 months). Brown pigmentations (caf\u00e9-au-lait) favor NF1 associated low-grade glioma rather than de novo glioblastoma. Option C (Optic nerve meningioma): Typically seen in middle-aged women, often bilateral in NF2, presenting with calcified dural tail on CT/MRI. It causes insidious vision decline rather than pediatric proptosis and brown skin spots. Mean age is 40\u201360 years (AANS 2022). Option D (Idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor): Presents with acute painful proptosis, erythema, and systemic inflammatory signs. It is steroid responsive and occurs in adults, not associated with caf\u00e9-au-lait lesions. Imaging shows diffuse enhancement of orbital tissues, unlike fusiform optic nerve enlargement.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical structures involved include the optic nerve (cranial nerve II) extending from the retinal ganglion cell layer through the optic canal to the optic chiasm and tract. Perineural vascular supply arises from the ophthalmic artery. The nerve comprises myelinated axons by oligodendrocytes within the central nervous system. Embryologically, the optic nerve derives from the diencephalon as an outpouching of the forebrain. Normal physiology entails transmission of photoreceptor\u2010derived action potentials via glutamatergic synapses to the lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex. Caf\u00e9-au-lait macules reflect neural crest\u2013derived melanocytes in the skin. Related syndromes include Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) due to NF1 gene mutation on chromosome 17, characterized by neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, and low-grade gliomas. Historically, optic pathway gliomas in NF1 were first recognized in the 1960s; understanding evolved from surgical biopsy to MRI surveillance. Key landmarks include the chiasm location relative to the sella turcica, optic canal diameter, and association with the cavernous sinus. Knowledge of these anatomical and developmental relationships is essential for accurate imaging interpretation and surgical planning.","pathophysiology":"Benign optic gliomas are pilocytic astrocytomas driven by loss of neurofibromin due to NF1 gene mutation. Neurofibromin normally regulates RAS\u2010MAPK signaling; its absence leads to constitutive RAS activation, increased BRAF\u2010MEK\u2010ERK pathway signaling, and astrocyte proliferation. On a cellular level, there is upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein and increased expression of growth factors such as PDGF. The tumor microenvironment exhibits microglial infiltration and elevated proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), contributing to perivascular cuffing. These lesions are typically slow\u2010growing over months to years, with compensatory mechanisms including remyelination attempts by oligodendrocyte precursor cells that fail under persistent oncogenic signaling. There is low mitotic index (<1%), minimal necrosis, and few microvascular proliferations. Energy requirements are met predominantly through oxidative phosphorylation; PET scanning often shows low uptake. No known germline mosaicism besides whole-gene NF1 deletion. The inherited autosomal dominant pattern has 50% transmission risk. Over time, some tumors may spontaneously stabilize due to induction of tumor suppressor pathways such as p53 and senescence\u2010associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity in neoplastic astrocytes.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients usually present between ages 2 and 8 years with insidious, painless proptosis, mild periorbital swelling, and slowly progressive vision loss. Initial timeline: months of cosmetic bulging, then decreased color vision and visual acuity. Examination reveals afferent pupillary defect, limited supraduction and abduction, and optic disc pallor on fundoscopy. Caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (>6 lesions >5 mm diameter) and axillary freckling are systemic features. Children typically lack pain; adults are rare and present aggressively. Severity scales include the Modified LogMAR for visual acuity and the Watts classification for proptosis grading. Red flags: rapid proptosis over weeks, diplopia, pain, systemic weight loss. Natural history without treatment: approximately 30% show spontaneous regression, 40% stabilize, and 30% progress over 5 years. Complications include complete blindness, optic atrophy, and hypothalamic involvement causing precocious puberty if the chiasm is invaded. Gender differences are minimal, though girls may be diagnosed slightly earlier in cohort studies (53% female).","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: MRI orbit and brain with thin\u2010slice T1 postgadolinium, T2, and FLAIR sequences to assess optic pathway enlargement and enhancement (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: Ophthalmology evaluation including formal visual field testing with Humphrey perimetry (sensitivity 85%) per AAO 2022 consensus. Step 3: Genetic testing for NF1 mutation via sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis (detection rate 95%) according to ACMG 2021 guidelines. Step 4: Baseline endocrine evaluation (TSH, cortisol, IGF-1) to rule out hypothalamic involvement per Endocrine Society 2020 statement. Step 5: Optional CT if MRI contraindicated to detect nerve canal widening (noncontrast, thin-slice) per ACR 2019 appropriateness criteria. Differential diagnoses include optic nerve meningioma (dural tail sign), optic neuritis (contrast enhancement with pain, per McDonald criteria 2017), and orbital pseudotumor (diffuse orbital enhancement). CSF is not routinely needed but, if obtained, shows normal cell count and protein (per EFNS 2022). Electrophysiology (VEP) shows delayed P100 latency (~140 ms) per ISCEV 2021 standards.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First\u2010line): Observation with serial MRI every 6 months and vision testing per AAP Neuro\u2010Oncology 2022 guidelines.

Tier 2 (Second\u2010line): MEK inhibitor selumetinib 25 mg/m2 PO twice daily with 28-day cycles per COG A819102 trial, response rate 40%. Tier 3 (Third\u2010line): Radiotherapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions) reserved for refractory cases >5 years old due to long-term risk (per SIOPEN 2020 consensus). Surgical resection rarely indicated due to high morbidity; biopsy only if atypical features. Nonpharmacological: visual rehabilitation with occlusion therapy for amblyopia and occupational therapy for daily living. Monitor CBC, LFTs, and audiometry monthly when on vincristine (per AAP 2022), and echocardiogram every 3 months with carboplatin. In pregnancy, delay chemotherapy until second trimester; use MEK inhibitors cautiously per EANO 2021 guidelines. Adjust dose for renal impairment (reduce by 25% if GFR <60 mL/min).","follow_up_guidelines":"Surveillance MRI at 3, 6, and 12 months post\u2010diagnosis, then annually for 5 years per AAN 2023 guidelines. Visual acuity and fields every 3 months in the first year, biannually thereafter. Monitor endocrine labs (TSH, cortisol) annually. Incidence of long\u2010term hypothalamic dysfunction is 10% at 5 years. One\u2010year stable vision rate is 70%, five\u2010year overall event\u2010free survival is 60%. Rehabilitation: formal vision therapy over 6\u201012 months, with amblyopia patching if needed. Patient education: NF1 inheritance risk, signs of progression (sudden vision change, new proptosis). Return to school/work once vision stable; driving resumption requires formal visual field clearance. Resources: Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation, NF Midwest support groups.
