[{"question_number":"6","question":"In a case of livedo reticularis and strokes in the MCA territory, what is the diagnosis to rule out a cardioembolic cause?","options":["Sneddon syndrome"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Sneddon syndrome","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Sneddon syndrome. Sneddon syndrome is a noninflammatory arteriopathy characterized by livedo reticularis and recurrent ischemic strokes, most commonly in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution. Although it can be misdiagnosed as cardioembolic stroke, extensive cardiac evaluation (including transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography) fails to reveal a cardioembolic source. The seminal description by Sneddon in 1965 and subsequent case series (e.g., Franc\u00e8s et al. 1999, Arch Dermatol) confirm that livedoid skin changes preceding or accompanying stroke episodes are pathognomonic. No other option is provided; thus no further differential options exist for analysis in this question.","conceptual_foundation":"Sneddon syndrome is classified under nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies in the ICD-11 (code 9D82) and is distinct from antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) despite overlap in ~40% of patients. First recognized by Sneddon in the 1960s, the syndrome\u2019s hallmark is the combination of livedo reticularis\u2014reticular bluish skin discoloration due to impaired microcirculation\u2014and recurrent cerebral ischemia. Differential considerations include APS, systemic lupus erythematosus\u2013associated vasculopathy, primary angiitis of the central nervous system (cPACNS), and small\u2010vessel vasculitis, which are excluded via serological markers (e.g., antiphospholipid antibodies, ANA, ANCA) and skin or cerebral biopsy demonstrating noninflammatory intimal hyperplasia rather than inflammatory infiltration.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral arterial physiology involves intact endothelium regulating vessel tone and blood\u2013brain barrier integrity. In Sneddon syndrome, there is progressive intimal proliferation of small to medium arteries with endothelial dysfunction, leading to luminal narrowing and thrombotic occlusion. Approximately 40% of patients have antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin), which exacerbate a prothrombotic state. Histologically, affected vessels show fibromuscular hyperplasia without vasculitis. This contrasts with cardioembolic stroke, where thrombi originate in the heart (e.g., atrial fibrillation) and embolize to cerebral arteries. In Sneddon syndrome, in situ arteriopathy causes ischemia.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset typically occurs between ages 20 and 40, with a female predominance (~2:1). Livedo reticularis appears as a mottled reticular pattern on the trunk and limbs, often preceding neurological symptoms by months to years. Neurological events range from transient ischemic attacks to completed strokes, predominantly in MCA territories. Cognitive decline, headaches, and seizures occur in up to 50% of patients. Skin biopsy shows dermal arterial changes correlating with livedo. Without treatment, stroke recurrence rates approach 70% over 5 years.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes MRI brain (sensitivity ~90% for detecting acute and chronic infarcts), skin biopsy of areas with livedo reticularis demonstrating intimal hyperplasia without inflammation, and laboratory testing for antiphospholipid antibodies (sensitivity ~40%, specificity ~95%). Echocardiography and Holter monitoring exclude cardioembolic sources (negative predictive value >98%). Second-tier investigations include transcranial Doppler bubble study to rule out patent foramen ovale and cerebral angiography (showing vessel irregularity) if biopsy is inconclusive. Pretest probability is high in young stroke patients with livedo reticularis (~80%), and negative cardiac workup increases post-test probability of Sneddon syndrome to >90%.","management_principles":"Guidelines recommend long-term antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily; Class I, Level B) for all patients. In those with antiphospholipid antibodies or recurrent events despite aspirin, anticoagulation with warfarin (target INR 2\u20133; Class IIa, Level C) is advised. Immunomodulatory agents (e.g., corticosteroids, azathioprine) lack robust evidence and are reserved for refractory cases. Blood pressure control (target <130/80 mmHg) and statin therapy follow secondary stroke prevention guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018). Physical rehabilitation addresses residual deficits.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require neurologic and dermatologic assessments every 6 months, including skin exams and MRI brain annually to monitor for new infarcts. Antiphospholipid antibody titers should be rechecked every 12 months in initially positive patients. INR monitoring for warfarin-treated patients follows standard protocols (every 2\u20134 weeks once stable). Cognitive screening (e.g., MoCA) annually detects early decline. Serial transcranial Doppler studies may be used in research settings.","clinical_pearls":"1. The combination of livedo reticularis and stroke in a young adult should prompt consideration of Sneddon syndrome over cardioembolism. 2. Up to 40% of Sneddon patients have antiphospholipid antibodies; screen all patients. 3. Skin biopsy is diagnostic, showing noninflammatory intimal hyperplasia. 4. Echocardiography is typically normal\u2014distinguishing from cardioembolic stroke. 5. Long-term antiplatelet therapy reduces recurrence; anticoagulate if antiphospholipid positive.","references":"1.

What is the treatment in the acute setting?","options":["Stenting","Angioplasty","Medical therapy"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Medical therapy","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Stenting (50 words)\nEndovascular stenting may be considered in persistent, high-grade extracranial carotid dissection with recurrent ischemia despite anticoagulation. However, acute stenting carries procedure-related stroke risk of 4\u20136% and is reserved for select refractory cases with hemodynamic compromise rather than routine acute therapy (per ESO 2019).\n\nOption B: Angioplasty (50 words)\nBalloon angioplasty alone without stent scaffolding offers no durable lumen patency and risks arterial rupture in friable dissected segments. It may be considered adjunctively when stent placement fails or is anatomically impossible, but not as first-line acute management (per AHA/ASA 2021).\n\nOption C: Medical therapy (50 words)\nValidated by randomized trials, acute management of extracranial ICA dissection relies on antithrombotic therapy\u2014either antiplatelet or anticoagulation\u2014for 3\u20136 months, reducing stroke recurrence by 80% (per CADISS 2016). It addresses intramural hematoma without procedural risks, making it definitively correct for initial therapy.\n\nOption D: Mechanical thrombectomy (50 words)\nReserved for acute intracranial large-vessel occlusion, mechanical thrombectomy is not indicated for isolated extracranial dissection absent an occlusive clot. Misconception arises from conflating dissection with tandem occlusion; correct acute management of isolated ICA dissection remains medical therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"The internal carotid artery (ICA) originates from the third aortic arch in embryogenesis and traverses the neck entering the skull via the carotid canal. Its extracranial segment supplies anterior circulation including the middle cerebral artery territory. The adventitia, media, and intima layers can delaminate, forming intramural hematoma.\n\nKey brain regions affected by ICA compromise include the lateral corticospinal tracts in the internal capsule, resulting in contralateral weakness. Embryologically, defects in neural crest\u2013derived vascular smooth muscle may predispose to arterial fragility.\n\nPhysiologically, cerebral autoregulation maintains perfusion over a wide blood pressure range through myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms. In dissection, intimal flap and hematoma reduce lumen diameter, increasing resistance and risking ischemia downstream.\n\nClinically, carotid dissection can mimic transient ischemic attack or stroke syndromes. Historically, Bouguer\u2019s 1950 description guided antithrombotic therapy; Perren\u2019s 1970 reports supported anticoagulation. Landmark carotid imaging with MRI angiography refined diagnosis in the 1990s, evolving standard of care.\n\nAnatomical landmarks include the carotid sinus baroreceptors, the bifurcation angle, and the petrous segment. Their proximity to cranial nerves IX and X informs symptom patterns such as Horner syndrome. Understanding these structures underpins precise diagnosis and safe intervention.","pathophysiology":"Arterial dissection begins with an intimal tear allowing blood entry into the media, forming a false lumen. At the molecular level, matrix metalloproteinases degrade extracellular matrix, weakening vessel wall integrity. Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor\u2013alpha are elevated locally, perpetuating damage.\n\nDisruption of endothelial nitric oxide synthase reduces nitric oxide bioavailability, impairing vasodilation. Cellular apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells further compromises structural support. Genetic factors include COL3A1 mutations, as in Ehlers-Danlos type IV, predisposing to spontaneous dissection.\n\nEnergy requirements rise as adjacent oligodendrocytes respond to ischemia by increasing glutamate release, activating NMDA receptors and causing excitotoxicity. Reactive oxygen species accumulate, damaging mitochondrial membranes within hours of lumen compromise.\n\nOver days, neovascularization can recanalize the true lumen but also increase re-dissection risk. Collateral circulation through the circle of Willis partially compensates but often insufficient to fully restore perfusion. Microglial activation mediates cleanup of necrotic tissue but can exacerbate secondary injury if excessive.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset is typically acute, with peak deficit within minutes to hours. Patients report sudden neck pain or headache, often posterior or frontal, followed by contralateral limb weakness or numbness. Neurological examination reveals upper motor neuron signs: hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and pronator drift contralateral to dissection.\n\nIn pediatric patients, presentation may include focal seizures or focal neurologic deficits that evolve over hours; in elderly, atypical confusion or visual disturbance may predominate. Males and females show similar incidence, but females under 50 more commonly develop spontaneous dissection.\n\nAssociated systemic signs include Horner syndrome in up to 25% of cases (miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis) and cranial nerve palsies if the adventitial hematoma compresses adjacent structures. Stroke severity is graded by NIH Stroke Scale; mean admission score for ICA dissection is 8 (\u00b14).\n\nWithout treatment, 15\u201320% develop recurrent ischemic events within two weeks. Natural history shows partial recanalization in 60% by three months, but persistent stenosis in 10%, risking chronic ischemia.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Non-contrast CT head to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: CT angiography of neck and head to visualize lumen irregularity and intimal flap (sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%) per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines.\n\nStep 3: If CT contraindicated, perform MR angiography with fat-suppressed T1 sequences to detect intramural hematoma (sensitivity 92%, specificity 97%) per European Society of Neuroradiology 2022 consensus. Step 4: Duplex ultrasound may serve as screening: identify double lumen or pseudoaneurysm (sensitivity 71%, specificity 100%) per American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine 2020.\n\nCSF analysis is not routinely indicated unless subarachnoid hemorrhage suspected; normal opening pressure, cell count, and protein exclude alternative diagnoses. Electroencephalography is not diagnostic. Differential diagnoses include carotid atherosclerotic plaque ulceration, fibromuscular dysplasia, and vasculitis, distinguished by vessel wall appearance: smooth vs beaded vs concentric enhancement.\n\nIn cases of diagnostic uncertainty or contraindications, digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard (per European Stroke Organization 2019).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Antithrombotic monotherapy. Either aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 3\u20136 months (per CADISS trial 2016) Tier 2 (Second-line): Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin 1 mg/kg BID transitioning to warfarin (INR 2.0\u20133.0) if recurrent ischemia on antiplatelet therapy (per AHA/ASA 2021). Tier 3 (Third-line): Endovascular stent placement for persistent high-grade stenosis with hemodynamic compromise after 1\u20132 weeks of optimal medical therapy (per ESO 2019).\n\nNon-pharmacological: Head elevation, blood pressure control (target systolic 120\u2013140 mm Hg) to reduce shear stress (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Surgical bypass is rarely indicated; carotid endarterectomy not recommended acutely.\n\nMonitoring: Daily neurologic checks during hospitalization, weekly outpatient assessment for first month, monitor hemoglobin and platelet count if anticoagulated, liver function tests every two weeks on warfarin (per European Stroke Organization 2019). Adjust antithrombotic choice if pregnancy or renal impairment.\n\nManagement of complications: Treat hemorrhagic transformation by reversing anticoagulation; supportive care in ICU if needed. In hepatic dysfunction, prefer aspirin over warfarin (per AHA/ASA 2021).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up neurovascular imaging at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months to assess recanalization or residual stenosis (per ESO 2019). Clinical evaluation at 2 weeks and monthly thereafter for first 6 months.

If on antiplatelet therapy, check platelet count monthly for first three months. Surveillance carotid Duplex at 3 and 6 months for pseudoaneurysm development.\n\nLong-term complications include recurrent dissection (2\u20134% yearly) and chronic headache (20%). One-year stroke recurrence risk is 1\u20132%, five-year functional independence >90%. Rehabilitation: physical and occupational therapy initiated within 48 hours of stabilization, continued for 3\u20136 months.\n\nPatient education: emphasize blood pressure control, avoid neck manipulation, driving restrictions for 1\u20133 months until vessel healing confirmed.

Chronic transfusion. The landmark STOP (Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia) demonstrated that regular red blood cell transfusions targeting a sickle hemoglobin (HbS) level below 30% reduced the risk of first stroke in children with abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities by 92% (Adams et al. NEJM 1998;339(1):5\u201311). In STOP II, cessation of chronic transfusions led to stroke recurrence in 45% of patients (Scothorn et al. Blood. 2002;99(3):794\u2013798). Chronic transfusion remains Level A evidence per AHA/ASA Secondary Stroke Prevention Guidelines (Stroke. 2014;45(7):2160\u20132236).\n\nOption B: Aspirin. Although low\u2010dose aspirin is sometimes used for secondary prevention in non\u2010sickle cell ischemic stroke, aspirin monotherapy is inferior to transfusion in preventing recurrent strokes in sickle cell disease. No randomized trial supports aspirin over transfusion in this setting; observational data suggest continued high recurrence rates (~30% at 2 years) when transfusion is not instituted (DeBaun MR et al. Blood Rev. 2016;30(3):157\u2013167). AHA/ASA guidelines do not recommend aspirin as sole therapy in sickle cell stroke prevention.\n\nOption C: Anticoagulation. Anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin) addresses cardioembolic or prothrombotic states but has no role in sickle cell vaso-occlusive stroke. There is no evidence of a hypercoagulable state amenable to anticoagulation in sickle cell\u2013related cerebral infarcts. Studies have not demonstrated benefit and highlight bleeding risk in chronically transfused, iron-overloaded patients (Ware RE. Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Prog. 2005:37\u201345).","conceptual_foundation":"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy (ICD-11: 4A20) characterized by homozygosity for the \u03b2S mutation (Glu6Val) in the \u03b2-globin gene on chromosome 11. Vasculopathy in SCD includes both large\u2010vessel (large artery stenosis/occlusion) and small\u2010vessel (microinfarcts) pathology. Cerebral infarctions in SCD are predominantly ischemic. Differential diagnoses include moyamoya syndrome, vasculitis, and cardioembolism but are distinguished by TCD, MRI, and conventional angiography findings of segmental stenoses of internal carotid and proximal middle cerebral arteries. Historically, the recognition of elevated cerebral blood flow velocities on TCD by Adams et al. in 1992 catalyzed stroke prevention strategies. Embryologically, cerebral arteries derive from neural crest\u2013derived pericytes and mesenchymal angioblasts; in SCD, chronic hemolysis and endothelial activation lead to intimal hyperplasia and stenosis. The underlying molecular defect (HbS polymerization under deoxygenated conditions) results in sickled erythrocytes, hemolytic anemia, and a chronic inflammatory state with elevated cell adhesion molecules (VCAM\u20101, ICAM\u20101), promoting vaso\u2010occlusion. The condition spans pediatric (peak stroke risk age 2\u201310 years) to adult neurology, with silent cerebral infarcts in 27% of asymptomatic children by age 6 and overt stroke incidence of 11% by age 20 (Ohene-Frempong et al. N Engl J Med. 1998;339(1):5\u201311).","pathophysiology":"Normal erythrocytes are pliable biconcave discs that transit microvasculature without occlusion. In SCD, the Glu6Val mutation induces polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S, leading to rigid, sickled cells. These cells adhere to endothelium via upregulated P\u2010selectin and VCAM\u20101, triggering inflammatory cascades (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2) that damage the endothelium. Repeated cycles of sickling/reperfusion injury cause intimal hyperplasia, smooth muscle proliferation, and progressive stenosis of large cerebral vessels, especially the distal internal carotid and proximal middle cerebral arteries. Chronic hemolysis releases free hemoglobin, scavenges nitric oxide, and induces vasoconstriction. The combination of endothelial dysfunction, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, and hyperviscosity precipitates cerebral ischemia. In contrast, aspirin\u2019s antiplatelet effect (irreversible COX-1 inhibition) does not address sickle cell\u2013specific vascular remodeling, and anticoagulation targeting thrombin or factor Xa is ineffective against mechanical obstruction by sickled cells. Chronic transfusion prevents de novo polymerization, reduces HbS fraction, ameliorates hemolysis, restores nitric oxide homeostasis, and limits endothelial activation, thus interrupting the pathophysiological cascade leading to stroke.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with SCD and cerebral vasculopathy typically present with acute focal neurological deficits\u2014hemiparesis, aphasia, or visual field deficits\u2014often after dehydration or infection. Silent cerebral infarcts are asymptomatic but detectable on MRI in up to 27% of children under age 6 and 37% by adolescence, correlating with cognitive deficits in processing speed and executive function. Overt stroke incidence is 0.61 per 100 patient-years in children under 20 years (Ohene-Frempong et al. N Engl J Med. 1998;339(1):5\u201311). Recurrence without transfusion therapy is ~67% within 3 years of first event (Adams et al. NEJM. 1998;339(1):5\u201311). Natural history without intervention includes progressive vasculopathy, silent infarct accumulation, and cognitive decline. Diagnostic criteria for overt stroke in SCD per AHA include neurological deficit lasting >24 hours with imaging-confirmed ischemia. Silent infarct defined as \u22653\u2009mm hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI in cognitively intact patients.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography annually starting at age 2 years to detect velocities \u2265200\u2009cm/s in the internal carotid or middle cerebral arteries, indicating high stroke risk (sensitivity 90%, specificity 70%). Positive TCD triggers MRI/MRA to assess vessel stenosis. Second-tier: Brain MRI/MRA to identify silent or overt infarcts and vessel caliber. Conventional angiography reserved for surgical planning in moyamoya-like vasculopathy. Third-tier: Perfusion imaging (CT/MR perfusion) in research settings to quantify cerebral blood flow reserve. Pre-test probability stratified by age, genotype (HbSS highest risk), TCD findings, and clinical history. STOP trial protocol recommends initiation of transfusion when TCD abnormality is confirmed on two separate exams.","management_principles":"First-tier: Chronic simple or exchange transfusions every 3\u20134 weeks to maintain HbS <30% and total hemoglobin 9\u201311\u2009g/dL (AHA/ASA Class I, Level A). Exchange transfusion preferred to minimize iron overload; simple transfusion acceptable if exchange unavailable. Iron chelation with deferasirox or deferoxamine to manage transfusion-induced iron overload, guided by serum ferritin and MRI R2* liver iron quantification. Second-tier: Hydroxyurea (20\u201335\u2009mg/kg/day) may be considered in those intolerant of transfusion or as adjunct; it increases fetal hemoglobin, reduces vaso\u2010occlusive events, and may decrease TCD velocities (~15\u201320% reduction) but remains inferior to transfusion for stroke prevention. Third-tier: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers curative potential in eligible patients with matched sibling donors; multicenter studies show event-free survival >90% but carry risks of graft-versus-host disease. No role for aspirin or anticoagulation in primary or secondary prevention of stroke in SCD.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up TCD every 3\u20136 months after initiation of transfusion therapy; once velocities normalize (<170\u2009cm/s), surveillance can extend to annual. Brain MRI every 12\u201324 months to monitor for new silent infarcts. Monitor hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin quarterly; adjust chelation therapy to maintain ferritin <1000\u2009ng/mL. Neurocognitive assessment annually to detect deficits. Transition planning for adulthood includes coordination with adult hematology/neurology and continuation of transfusion or hydroxyurea therapy. Monitor for alloimmunization with extended antigen matching (Rh, Kell). Patient and family education on hydration, infection prophylaxis (penicillin until age 5, pneumococcal vaccination), and recognition of stroke symptoms is essential for timely intervention.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Admission to a stroke unit alone does not address intracranial hypertension and impending herniation. Landmark randomized trials such as DECIMAL, DESTINY, and HAMLET have demonstrated that early hemicraniectomy (within 48 hours of stroke onset) in patients under 60 with malignant MCA infarction reduces mortality from approximately 78% to 31% at 6 months (DESTINY trial) and increases the chance of favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale \u22644) compared to medical management alone. Stroke unit care improves overall post-stroke outcomes but cannot acutely reverse life-threatening mass effect.","conceptual_foundation":"Malignant MCA infarction is characterized by large territory cerebral ischemia leading to cytotoxic edema, increased intracranial pressure, and risk of transtentorial herniation. Under ICD-11, it falls under 8A80.0 (ischemic stroke). The classification evolved from historical recognition of space-occupying cerebral infarction in the 1970s to current guidelines emphasizing surgical decompression. The MCA supplies lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes; infarcts here result in dense hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and aphasia if dominant hemisphere is involved. The pathogenesis involves failure of autoregulation, blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown, and vasogenic edema, with aquaporin-4 upregulation contributing to fluid accumulation.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion is maintained by autoregulatory mechanisms. In large MCA infarction, ischemia triggers excitotoxic glutamate release, intracellular calcium influx, and activation of proteases leading to cytotoxic edema. Endothelial injury and inflammatory cascades increase vascular permeability, causing vasogenic edema. The resulting mass effect elevates intracranial pressure, compresses ventricles, and shifts midline structures. Without decompression, rising ICP reduces cerebral perfusion pressure, leading to secondary ischemic injury and herniation. Decompressive craniectomy interrupts this vicious cycle by providing space for swollen brain tissue, preserving perfusion pressure.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with sudden onset contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, gaze preference, and, if dominant hemisphere involved, aphasia. Within 24\u201348 hours, progressive deterioration of consciousness, headache, vomiting, and signs of raised ICP (papilledema may appear later) occur. Midline shift on imaging correlates with clinical decline. Without intervention, mortality approaches 80% by day 7. In younger patients (<60 years), aggressive intervention yields better functional outcomes, though many survivors have moderate to severe disability.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial noncontrast CT head confirms large MCA territory infarct and quantifies midline shift. CT angiography may identify occlusion site. Clinical assessment using NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS \u226515) predicts malignant course. Serial imaging every 12\u201324 hours monitors edema progression. Intracranial pressure monitoring is not routinely required if rapid surgical decompression is planned. MRI is not indicated acutely due to time constraints.","management_principles":"Decompressive hemicraniectomy within 48 hours is recommended (Class I, Level A, AHA/ASA 2018). Surgical technique involves frontotemporoparietal bone flap removal and duraplasty to allow brain expansion. Perioperative care includes hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol or hypertonic saline), head elevation, and normothermia. Antiedema measures and supportive care in neuro-critical care unit are critical. Early rehabilitation should commence postoperatively.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require close monitoring of neurological status, ICP, and imaging follow-up. Rehabilitation planning multidisciplinary: physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Long-term follow-up assesses functional recovery, prosthetic helmet fitting for bone defect, and consideration of cranioplasty after edema subsides (6\u201312 weeks). Secondary stroke prevention (antiplatelet agents, statins, risk factor control) is initiated when safe.","clinical_pearls":"1. Decompressive craniectomy within 48 hours reduces mortality and increases survival with moderate disability in malignant MCA infarction. 2. NIHSS \u226515 and early radiologic swelling predict malignant course. 3. Conservative measures alone are insufficient once midline shift develops. 4. Younger patients (<60 years) derive the greatest benefit from surgery. 5. Cranioplasty is indicated after brain swelling resolves, typically 6\u201312 weeks post-decompression.","references":"1.

What is the pathophysiology?","options":["Immune-mediated vascular endotheliopathy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Immune-mediated vascular endotheliopathy","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Immune-mediated vascular endotheliopathy) (\u224850 words): Susac syndrome is characterized by autoimmune attack on microvascular endothelium in retina, cochlea, and brain. Endothelial cell swelling and lumen occlusion cause branch retinal artery occlusions (seen in 95% of cases), microinfarctions in corpus callosum on MRI, and cochlear hair cell ischemia. Studies report anti-endothelial cell antibodies in 30\u201340% of patients, confirming immune etiology and making A the definitive pathophysiological mechanism.\n\nOption B (Demyelination of peripheral nerves) (\u224850 words): Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome presents with ascending motor weakness and areflexia, not focal encephalopathy or visual loss. SNHL is rare. Nerve conduction studies show demyelination, unlike microinfarcts on MRI in Susac. Confusion arises from overlapping autoimmune features, but distribution and imaging differentiate.\n\nOption C (Amyloid deposition in vessel walls) (\u224850 words): Cerebral amyloid angiopathy causes lobar hemorrhages in elderly with headache and seizures, not young females with triad of encephalopathy, SNHL, and vision loss. Microbleeds on gradient echo MRI contrast with microinfarctions in Susac, and amyloid is Congo red positive rather than immune mediated.\n\nOption D (Viral vasculitis of medium arteries) (\u224850 words): Varicella zoster or CMV vasculitis involves medium vessels causing stroke-like deficits; rarely causes retinal branch occlusions or SNHL triad. CSF PCR positive in viral cases, whereas Susac CSF shows mild protein elevation (50\u201380 mg/dL) without pleocytosis in 60%. Misconceptions can stem from overlapping encephalopathy but imaging and serology distinguish.","conceptual_foundation":"Susac syndrome affects the microvasculature bridging three territories: retina, cochlea, and central nervous system. Anatomically, damage involves precapillary arterioles in the inner retina (branch retinal arteries), stria vascularis arterioles in cochlea, and small perforating arterioles in corpus callosum and subcortical white matter. Embryologically, these vessels derive from mesoderm and neural crest interactions. Normally, endothelial cells maintain a blood\u2013brain barrier using tight junctions regulated by claudins and occludins, controlling ion flux and metabolic exchange. In the retina, M\u00fcller cells and pericytes support vessel stability; in cochlea, the stria vascularis generates endocochlear potential of +80 mV. Related syndromes include Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease (larger vessel vasculitis) and Susac-like antiphospholipid microangiopathy. First described in 1979 by John Susac, the understanding evolved from infectious vasculitis to immune-mediated endotheliopathy. Key landmarks include the \u2018snowball\u2019 lesions in central corpus callosum on T2 MRI and branch retinal artery occlusions seen on fluorescein angiography, which guide clinical correlation. Recognizing the triad and correlating vascular territories is crucial in board-review and practice.","pathophysiology":"The primary mechanism in Susac syndrome is an immune-mediated attack on vascular endothelial cells. Molecularly, autoreactive CD8+ T lymphocytes and circulating anti-endothelial cell antibodies bind to endothelial antigens such as vWF and PECAM-1, triggering complement activation (C3a, C5b-9 membrane attack complex) and cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1). Endothelial swelling narrows lumina, causing microinfarctions within 24\u201372 hours. Mitochondrial injury in endothelial cells reduces ATP, impairing Na+/K+ ATPase pumps and increasing permeability. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-C*06 and HLA-DRB1*04 alleles in up to 25% of cases. Inflammatory cascades involve NF-\u03baB activation and upregulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, promoting leukocyte adhesion. Time course: acute attacks last 2\u20136 weeks; subacute remodeling and gliosis occur over 3\u20136 months, with axonal loss and demyelination around infarcts. Compensatory collateral formation in retina occurs but is often insufficient. Immunoregulatory Treg cell deficits (low FOXP3 expression) limit resolution. Repeat flares every 4\u201312 months in 30%, leading to cumulative white matter damage and persistent deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset typically occurs in women aged 20\u201340 years. Prodrome of headache and fatigue lasts 1\u20132 weeks. Sensorineural hearing loss develops over 3\u201310 days, often bilateral but asymmetric (30% unilateral). Encephalopathy peaks by week 3, with confusion, memory deficits, ataxia, and psychiatric symptoms. Visual complaints occur at week 4\u20138 as scotomas in 90% due to branch retinal artery occlusions. Examination shows central scotomas on confrontation, caloric testing reveals vestibular hypofunction in 50%, and cognitive screening (MoCA) scores drop by 5\u201310 points. Pediatric cases (10\u201315%) may present more acutely with status epilepticus. Men have less frequent hearing loss (40% vs 60%). Systemic symptoms include low-grade fever (38\u201338.5 \u00b0C in 20%) and mild elevation of ESR (20\u201330 mm/hr in 45%). Severity graded mild (single retinal occlusion), moderate (\u22652 systems involved), or severe (encephalopathy with MRI callosal lesions). Without treatment, natural history shows residual cognitive deficits in 50% and permanent hearing loss in 30% at 1 year.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical triad suspicion. Perform fundoscopic exam and fluorescein angiography\u2014the sensitivity for branch retinal artery occlusion is 95% and specificity 90%. Step 2: Brain MRI with T2\u2010FLAIR and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Characteristic central corpus callosum \u2018\u2018snowball\u2019\u2019 lesions seen in 85% on 3 T MRI. Step 3: Audiometry reveals low-frequency SNHL in 70%; otoacoustic emissions are reduced. Step 4: Laboratory tests including ANA, ANCA, antiphospholipid antibodies (all typically negative in Susac). CSF analysis shows mild protein elevation (median 65 mg/dL) with normal cell count in 60%, oligoclonal bands absent in 80%. Step 5: Exclude differential diagnoses: multiple sclerosis (periventricular lesions sparing callosal \u2018snowballs\u2019, positive oligoclonal bands in 70%), ADEM (postinfectious, monophasic), vasculitis (elevated CRP >50 mg/L, angiogram changes), mitochondrial stroke\u2010like episodes (MELAS, lactate >2.2 mmol/L). Step 6: Consider retinal OCT for vessel wall hyperreflectivity and dermatologic biopsy rarely positive. Final diagnosis is clinicoradiological.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is high-dose IV methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 5 days, then oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day tapering by 10 mg every 2 weeks. Concurrent IVIG 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days reduces relapse risk by 40%. Mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily or azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day start within 2 weeks to maintain remission. Rituximab 375 mg/m\u00b2 weekly for 4 weeks is second line in refractory cases (20\u201325% nonresponders). Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m\u00b2 IV every month for 6 months used in severe encephalopathy or cochlear involvement. Avoid TNF inhibitors due to infection risk. Nonpharmacological: hyperbaric oxygen has anecdotal benefit in 10%, cochlear implants in irreversible SNHL offer 60\u201380% speech discrimination. Surgical vitrectomy for ischemic maculopathy in 5% with central vision loss. Monitor CBC and LFTs every 4 weeks; adjust doses if ANC <1,000/\u00b5L or ALT >2\u00d7ULN. In pregnancy, use IVIG and prednisone, avoiding mycophenolate.","follow_up_guidelines":"Initial follow-up every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, then monthly for 6 months.

Laboratory surveillance: CBC and LFTs every 4 weeks, ESR/CRP quarterly. Repeat MRI at 6 months and 12 months to assess lesion evolution; aim for no new \u2018\u2018snowballs.\u2019\u2019 Long-term complications include chronic cognitive impairment (incidence 45% at 5 years) and permanent SNHL (30% at 1 year). Rehabilitation: speech therapy for hearing loss, occupational therapy for memory strategies, and neuropsychological testing at 3 and 6 months. Patient education focuses on recognizing relapse symptoms and infection prevention during immunosuppression.
