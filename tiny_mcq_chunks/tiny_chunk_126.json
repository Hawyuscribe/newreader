In HIV patients with CD4 counts below 50 cells/\u00b5L, reactivation of latent Toxoplasma gondii infection frequently leads to multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the basal ganglia and can manifest as parkinsonism when these nuclei are involved. Primary CNS lymphoma (option C) typically presents as one or a few deep periventricular lesions and rarely produces an extrapyramidal syndrome. Cryptococcal infection (option B) primarily causes meningitis or meningoencephalitis rather than focal basal ganglia lesions with parkinsonian features.","conceptual_foundation":"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan. In the immunocompetent host it remains latent in tissue cysts, but in patients with advanced AIDS (CD4 < 50 cells/\u00b5L) it reactivates and causes cerebral abscesses, especially in the basal ganglia. The predilection for deep gray matter structures explains the clinical overlap with Parkinson\u2019s disease when nigrostriatal pathways are disrupted.","pathophysiology":"Reactivation of bradyzoite cysts leads to focal necrosis with inflammatory infiltrates. In the basal ganglia, destruction of striatal neurons and interruption of dopaminergic projections from the substantia nigra pars compacta produce parkinsonian features (rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present subacutely with headache, fever, confusion, focal motor deficits; when lesions involve the putamen or caudate, contralateral rigidity and bradykinesia occur.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Cysticercosis","Toxoplasmosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Cysticercosis","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Cysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is endemic in India and is the most common cause of seizures associated with multiple small intracranial lesions (Del Brutto et al., Neurology 2001). Imaging typically demonstrates multiple ring\u2010enhancing lesions at various stages, some with the characteristic scolex ('hole-with-dot' sign) on MRI, findings with sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 97% (Kim et al., J Clin Microbiol 2001). Albendazole therapy plus corticosteroids significantly reduces lesion burden (Hazard ratio for lesion resolution 2.3, 95% CI 1.7\u20133.1) (Garcia et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg 1997).\n\nOption B (Toxoplasmosis) is less likely: Toxoplasma gondii typically causes ring\u2010enhancing lesions in immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV/AIDS with CD4 <100 cells/mm3), often accompanied by systemic signs and positive serology (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90% for IgG) (Porter et al., Clin Infect Dis 1991). Our patient is immunocompetent, and toxoplasmosis lesions coalesce with marked edema rather than multiple small discrete cysts with scoleces. Common misconception arises from assuming all multiple ring lesions in India are toxoplasmosis, but standard prevalence studies show neurocysticercosis accounts for over 50% of seizure etiologies in the region (Singh et al., Trop Med Int Health 2005).","conceptual_foundation":"Neurocysticercosis is caused by the larval form of Taenia solium upon ingestion of eggs; larvae (cysticerci) invade the CNS. In ICD-11, it is classified under 1D26.0 \u2018Cysticercosis of central nervous system\u2019. The differential includes other ring-enhancing infections (toxoplasmosis, tuberculoma, pyogenic abscesses), neoplasms (metastases), and granulomatous diseases (neurosarcoidosis). Historically, recognition of cysticercosis dates to 16th-century autopsies, but modern nosology evolved with Del Brutto diagnostic criteria (2001), incorporating imaging, serology, and epidemiology. The embryologic entry occurs via the GIT, oncospheres penetrate intestinal mucosa, migrate hematogenously to the CNS. Neuroanatomically, cysticerci localize to parenchyma, ventricles, and subarachnoid spaces; common sites include supratentorial regions supplied by middle cerebral artery perforators. Pathways: larvae provoke host Th1-mediated inflammation, with IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 release around degenerating cysts. Antigenic variation among Taenia solium strains (TSOL18, TSOL56 proteins) influences immunogenicity. Relevant genetics: host HLA\u2010DRB1*1507 confers susceptibility to heavier cyst burden (Guill\u00e9n et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2016).","pathophysiology":"Normal central nervous system parenchyma is immune-privileged with blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) integrity maintained by tight junctions among endothelial cells. In neurocysticercosis, oncospheres in the bloodstream breach the BBB via transcytosis or paracellular migration, developing into cysticerci in parenchyma. Live cysts inhibit inflammation through secretion of anti\u2010inflammatory molecules (e.g., paramyosin, TGF\u2010\u03b2 analogues), maintaining quiescent vesicular stage. When cysts degenerate (colloidal vesicular stage), cyst antigens (Taenia solium antigen B) are released, triggering complement activation (C3a, C5a), microglial activation via TLR2/4, and a robust Th1 response with IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1 causing perilesional edema, seizures, and focal deficits. Granuloma formation ensues in the granular-nodular and calcified stages, with astrocytosis and gliosis. Temporal progression: vesicular (silent), colloidal (symptomatic), granular\u2010nodular (diminishing), and calcified (sequelae). Edema peaks 7\u201310 days post\u2010degeneration. In contrast, Toxoplasma causes focal necrosis via tachyzoite proliferation, microglial nodules, and abscess formation rather than a discrete cystic lifecycle.","clinical_manifestation":"Seizures are the most frequent presentation (up to 80% of cases), most often partial seizures with secondary generalization (Carpio et al., Neurology 1998). Headache occurs in 46% due to raised intracranial pressure or focal inflammation. Focal deficits occur in 10\u201315% (e.g., hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies). Meningeal signs are rare (<5%), except in subarachnoid racemose cysticercosis. Intracranial hypertension from mass effect or hydrocephalus (ventricular obstruction by cysts) presents with progressive headache, papilledema. Variants: parenchymal vs extraparenchymal; parenchymal more seizures, extraparenchymal more hydrocephalus. Age: most adults aged 20\u201340 in endemic regions; pediatric cases represent 10% with similar syndrome but higher risk of status epilepticus. Natural history: untreated parenchymal cysts often calcify over 2\u20135 years; 50% become seizure free without therapy, but risk of chronic epilepsy persists around 30%. The modified Del Brutto criteria require neuroimaging plus epidemiologic or serologic support for definitive diagnosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 96%).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Neuroimaging with noncontrast CT detects calcified lesions (sensitivity ~85%), while MRI with T2/FLAIR and contrast identifies vesicular and colloidal cysts with scolex (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~97%). Obtain contrast\u2010enhanced MR imaging for optimal lesion characterization. Simultaneous serologic testing: EITB assay (enzyme\u2010linked immunoelectrotransfer blot) has sensitivity 98% for multiple cysts, specificity 100% (Tsang et al., J Infect Dis 1989). CSF analysis in extraparenchymal disease shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, low glucose, and sometimes cysticercal antigen (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%). Second-tier: CT angiography if vasculitis suspected; ocular exam to rule out intraocular cysts prior to antiparasitic therapy. Third-tier: Biopsy only if diagnosis remains uncertain, especially for single lesions in nonendemic areas. Pretest probability in endemic India exceeds 50%, raising post\u2010test probability of NCC to >95% with positive EITB. Algorithm: seizure + endemic \u2192 CT/MRI \u2192 EITB \u2192 treat.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy: Albendazole 15 mg/kg/day divided twice daily for 28 days plus dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg/day, tapering over 2\u20134 weeks, yields lesion resolution rate of 66% vs 13% with placebo (Garcia et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg 1997; Class I, Level A). Praziquantel 50 mg/kg/day for 15 days is alternative (lesion resolution 60%) but less effective against extraparenchymal cysts. Combination albendazole\u2010praziquantel yields marginal benefit (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9\u20131.5). Antiepileptic drugs: initiate sodium valproate or carbamazepine to control seizures; taper after 1\u20132 years seizure\u2010free. Second-tier: ventriculoperitoneal shunting for hydrocephalus; surgical removal for accessible giant cysts (>2 cm) or intraventricular cysts causing acute obstruction. Third-tier: immunomodulators (e.g., methotrexate) in refractory inflammatory racemose cases. Nonpharmacologic: seizure precautions, dietary sodium limitation during steroids. Pregnancy: avoid albendazole in first trimester; treat postpartum. Pediatric: dosage adjustment by weight; monitor liver enzymes. Geriatric: lower initial steroid dose. Renal/hepatic impairment: albendazole dose reduction by 25%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neuroimaging follow\u2010up at 3 and 6 months post\u2010therapy: resolution or calcification of cysts expected in 60\u201380% by 6 months. Seizure monitoring: EEG yearly if seizures persist. Steroid taper schedule: reduce dose by 50% every 5 days after day 10. Monitor liver function tests biweekly during albendazole. Calculate recurrence risk: residual enhancing lesions at 6 months predict ongoing seizures (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3\u20134.8). Long\u2010term AED therapy: continue 2 years after last seizure; taper by 25% every 2 months. Rehabilitation for focal deficits: physical and occupational therapy referral within 1 week of symptom onset improves functional outcome (Modified Rankin Scale at 6 months improved by 0.5 points, p<0.05). Transition care to primary providers for imaging surveillance annually. Patient education: seizure triggers, medication adherence, signs of raised ICP.","clinical_pearls":"1. In endemic regions, multiple small ring\u2010enhancing lesions with scolex are pathognomonic for neurocysticercosis\u2014remember the 'hole-with-dot' sign. 2. Always co\u2010administer steroids with antiparasitic therapy to reduce inflammatory complications; abrupt withdrawal of steroids can precipitate cerebral edema. 3. EITB serology is nearly 100% specific for multiple cysts but less sensitive for single lesions\u2014interpret negative serology cautiously. 4. Calcified cysts may still provoke seizures due to perilesional gliosis\u2014ongoing AED therapy may be required independent of cyst resolution. 5. Intraventricular cysts often present with acute hydrocephalus and require surgical removal or shunting\u2014medical therapy alone is insufficient.

SSPE typically presents in children and adolescents with a progressive cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and eventually unresponsiveness over months. EEG classically shows periodic, high-voltage slow wave complexes (Radermecker complexes) occurring every 4\u201310 seconds, which is highly specific for SSPE (sensitivity ~65%, specificity ~90%) (Garg 2021; Aicardi 2019). Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) can show periodic sharp wave complexes at ~1 Hz, but it presents in older adults with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and cerebellar signs over weeks, not school performance decline in a child (Pritchard 2019). The age group, subacute time course of months, and EEG periodic slow waves point strongly to SSPE. Common misconception: CJD periodic complexes are sharper and faster (~1-2 Hz) and occur in elderly patients, whereas SSPE complexes are slower and seen in pediatric cases.","conceptual_foundation":"SSPE is a late complication of wild-type measles infection due to persistent mutated measles virus in the CNS. In ICD-11 it is classified under 8D82.0 (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis). SSPE\u2019s differential includes CJD, autoimmune encephalitis, mitochondrial disorders, and toxic leukoencephalopathies. Historically described by Dawson in 1933, its taxonomy evolved as a viral persistent infection rather than autoimmune. Embryologically, SSPE targets cortical grey matter and subcortical white matter; the mutated virus spreads cell-to-cell along neuronal processes. Neuroanatomically, lesions occur in parieto-occipital lobes and basal ganglia; neurotransmitters affected include GABA and glutamate. Blood supply corresponds to MCA watershed zones, explaining early visual disturbances. Molecularly, defective M gene variants allow persistent replication; host factors like interferon signaling (STAT1/STAT2) are implicated (Hegde et al. 2023).","pathophysiology":"Normal neuronal physiology relies on intact synaptic transmission and viral clearance by host immunity. In SSPE, persistent defective measles virus evades immunity, leading to chronic neuronal infection. Mutations in the M gene impair viral budding, trapping virions intracellularly and triggering neuronal apoptosis through caspase cascades and mitochondrial dysfunction. Microglial activation and astrocytosis result in inflammatory cytokine release (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), causing demyelination. Progressive synaptic loss leads to cortical atrophy, while axonal damage produces white matter vacuolation. Acute changes include periodic neuronal depolarizations (seen as EEG periodic complexes), whereas chronic demyelination underlies motor and cognitive decline. In contrast, CJD involves prion-induced misfolded PrPsc aggregation, spongiform vacuolation, and rapid synaptic loss without slow periodic waves. The distinct molecular mechanisms explain the differences in clinical progression and EEG findings (Kov\u00e1cs 2018).","clinical_manifestation":"SSPE typically begins 7\u201310 years after measles infection, often in children aged 5\u201315. Early features: cognitive decline (school performance drop in ~85%), behavioral changes (70%), and poor attention. Stage II includes myoclonus (80%), ataxia (60%), and seizures (50%). Stage III: severe dementia, rigidity, and decorticate posturing. Stage IV: coma and autonomic failure. Without treatment, median survival is 1\u20133 years after onset; rare adult cases have longer courses. Diagnostic criteria (Dyken 2017) include elevated measles antibody titers in CSF (ratio CSF/serum >1:625), typical EEG, and clinical progression. Atypical presentations can include isolated psychiatric symptoms or focal deficits. In immunocompromised hosts, progression may be accelerated with more fulminant courses.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: EEG (periodic slow wave complexes every 4\u201310 seconds; sensitivity 65%, specificity 90%) and CSF measles IgG titers. Serum IgG ratio to CSF IgG >300:1 suggests intrathecal synthesis (PPV 85%, NPV 88%). Second-tier: MRI showing T2 hyperintensities in subcortical white matter and cortical ribboning; sensitivity 70%, specificity 75%. Third-tier: brain biopsy demonstrating viral inclusions and gliosis for definitive diagnosis when noninvasive tests are inconclusive. Pretest probability is high in patients with history of measles and subacute cognitive decline. In resource-limited settings, EEG combined with serum measles IgG may suffice. CSF PCR for measles RNA has low sensitivity (~40%) and is not routinely recommended (WHO measles guidelines 2020).","management_principles":"No curative therapy exists. First-line: intraventricular/interferon-\u03b1 1\u20133 million IU thrice weekly plus oral isoprinosine 50 mg/kg/day has shown partial stabilization in ~20% (Garg 2021; level B). Second-line: ribavirin via intraventricular route in refractory cases; small case series suggest transient benefit. Third-line: favipiravir is experimental. Supportive: anticonvulsants for myoclonus (levetiracetam, clonazepam), physical therapy for spasticity, nutritional support. Avoid immunosuppressants.

Myelopathy. Neuroschistosomiasis due to Schistosoma mansoni most commonly presents as a spinal cord syndrome because eggs deposited in the vertebral venous plexus incite a granulomatous inflammatory reaction leading to myelopathy. Multiple case series have documented that over 50\u201360% of neuroschistosomiasis cases present with spinal involvement (Ormerod et al. 1985; Tello et al. 2007). In contrast, intracranial involvement is rare, and presentations such as venous thrombosis and aneurysms are not described in the literature.\n\nOption A (Venous thrombosis) is incorrect: there is no evidence linking S. mansoni infection to intracerebral venous sinus thrombosis; the primary pathology is granulomatous inflammation and ova granuloma formation, not thrombophilia. Option B (Intracranial aneurysm) is incorrect: no case reports or pathophysiological basis support aneurysm formation in schistosomiasis. Option C (Focal deficit) is incomplete: while patients may present with focal neurological signs, these are part of a broader myelopathic syndrome rather than isolated cortical events.

Schistosoma mansoni is a digenetic trematode that primarily causes intestinal schistosomiasis, but ectopic migration of eggs can occur. In the central nervous system, eggs reach the spinal cord via the valveless pelvic and vertebral venous plexuses (Batson venous plexus). Taxonomically, S. mansoni belongs to the genus Schistosoma, family Schistosomatidae, and in ICD-11 is coded as B65.4. Neuroschistosomiasis is classified under parasitic infections of the nervous system. Differential diagnoses include other causes of transverse myelitis such as viral infections, autoimmune etiologies, and neoplastic infiltration. Historically, spinal schistosomiasis was first described in the early 20th century, with evolving understanding of its pathogenesis and imaging correlates. Embryologically, the development of the parasitic eggs\u2019 tropism to spinal vasculature is linked to the maturation of the host venous plexus.","pathophysiology":"In neuroschistosomiasis, normal physiology of the spinal cord involves perfusion by the anterior spinal artery and drainage via the epidural venous plexus without parasite presence. Pathologically, S. mansoni eggs embolize to the spinal cord venous plexus and lodge in the subarachnoid veins and parenchyma. The host mounts a Th2-mediated immune response characterized by eosinophil recruitment and granuloma formation around eggs. Cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 drive fibrosis and tissue damage. The resulting granulomatous inflammation leads to cord edema, demyelination, and ischemic injury due to vascular compromise. Chronic inflammation causes gliosis and irreversible neuronal loss. Comparatively, intracranial schistosomiasis involves parenchymal granulomas or pseudotumors but is far less common. There is no mechanism for aneurysm formation or venous thrombosis in this parasitic infection, distinguishing it from vascular causes of myelopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"Spinal schistosomiasis typically presents subacutely over days to weeks with progressive paraparesis, sensory level, sphincter dysfunction, and back pain. Lower limb weakness is often bilateral and symmetric, accompanied by hyperreflexia, Babinski signs, and sensory disturbances below the lesion. Bladder and bowel involvement with urinary retention and constipation occur in up to 70% of cases. Vesical dysfunction may precede motor deficits. Systemic signs such as fever and eosinophilia are variable. Rarely, patients present with radicular pain or isolated sensory deficits. Intracranial schistosomiasis, when present, can manifest as seizures or focal cortical signs but represents less than 10% of neuroschistosomiasis cases in most series. Untreated spinal cases progress to severe myelopathy and permanent disability within weeks to months.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic diagnostic approach includes epidemiological risk assessment (endemic exposure), neurological examination, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, serology, and parasitological studies. MRI of the spine is the modality of choice, revealing T2 hyperintense lesions, cord enlargement, and nodular enhancement in the conus medullaris region. Sensitivity of MRI for spinal schistosomiasis is approximately 85%, with specificity around 90%. CSF analysis often shows lymphocytic pleocytosis with eosinophilia, elevated protein, and normal to low glucose. Schistosomal serology (ELISA) in serum and CSF supports the diagnosis with high sensitivity (>95%) but cross-reactivity can reduce specificity. Stool examination for S. mansoni eggs may be negative in neuroschistosomiasis. Nerve conduction studies are not typically diagnostic. A biopsy is rarely required unless imaging and serology are inconclusive.","management_principles":"First-line treatment consists of praziquantel 40 mg/kg orally as a single dose, repeated after four to six weeks, in combination with corticosteroids to reduce inflammatory damage. Prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day for two to four weeks, followed by taper, has been shown to improve neurological outcomes (Agnew & Chiodini 2013). Praziquantel acts by increasing parasite membrane permeability to calcium ions, causing tetanic contraction and parasite death. Corticosteroids mitigate granulomatous inflammation and edema. Level B evidence supports adjunctive corticosteroids in neuroschistosomiasis (WHO 2019). Supportive care includes physiotherapy, bladder management, and nutritional support. Anticholinergics may be used for neurogenic bladder. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity of praziquantel and corticosteroid side effects is necessary.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require regular clinical and imaging follow-up. Neurological examinations should be performed monthly for the first six months and then quarterly, assessing motor strength, sensory function, and sphincter control. Repeat MRI at three months post-treatment evaluates lesion resolution; residual enhancement beyond six months may indicate ongoing inflammation. Serial serological titers can track treatment response but may remain positive for years due to antibody persistence. Rehabilitation focuses on gait training and bladder training. Long-term surveillance includes annual assessments for potential relapse or late sequelae, such as spasticity and neuropathic pain. Prognostic factors include severity at onset, rapidity of treatment initiation, and degree of cord involvement on initial MRI.","clinical_pearls":"1. Consider spinal schistosomiasis in any patient from an endemic area with subacute paraparesis and sphincter dysfunction\u2014early MRI can prevent permanent disability.\n2. MRI showing conus medullaris enlargement and nodular enhancement is highly suggestive of neuroschistosomiasis, differentiating it from other causes of transverse myelitis.\n3. CSF eosinophilia is a key diagnostic clue; though not pathognomonic, its presence in the right clinical context strengthens the diagnosis.\n4. Combining praziquantel with corticosteroids improves neurological recovery by addressing both parasitic death and inflammatory damage.\n5. Delay in treatment beyond four weeks from symptom onset is associated with poorer outcomes; rapid initiation of therapy is crucial.","references":"1.

What is the correct information to provide?","options":["No risk after 2 days of isolation","Ciprofloxacin ## Page 15"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Ciprofloxacin","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Ciprofloxacin. According to CDC guidelines (2015), close contacts of a patient with Neisseria meningitidis meningitis should receive chemoprophylaxis to eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage and prevent secondary cases. Recommended regimens include rifampin for four doses over two days (Level A evidence), a single dose of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg in adults; Level A evidence), or a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone (250 mg in adults; Level B evidence). Ciprofloxacin offers excellent compliance due to single-dose administration and high nasopharyngeal eradication rates (>90%). Option A is incorrect: isolation and treatment of the index case for two days do not eliminate risk to contacts; transmission can occur during the incubation period before antibiotics and carriage can persist in asymptomatic contacts. There is no evidence supporting a zero-risk threshold after 48 hours of index-case isolation (AAN 2016 practice parameter).","conceptual_foundation":"Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative diplococcus classified into at least 13 serogroups based on polysaccharide capsule antigens; serogroups A, B, C, W-135, X, and Y account for virtually all cases. It is transmitted via respiratory droplets and close contact. Once inhaled, the organism attaches to nasopharyngeal epithelium, evades mucosal immunity, and may invade the bloodstream. Carriage is common (5\u201310% of adolescents and adults), but invasive disease is rare (~1\u20132 per 100,000 per year in the United States). In the ICD-11, meningococcal meningitis is coded under 1C51.0: \"Acute meningococcal meningitis.\" Understanding the molecular basis of capsule synthesis (e.g., cssA gene cluster), invasion (opa and pili proteins), and antigenic variation is key to vaccine development and prophylaxis strategies. Detailed knowledge of polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines against serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y informs public health approaches to population immunity.","pathophysiology":"Normal mucosal immunity prevents systemic invasion of Neisseria meningitidis. When capsular polysaccharide allows evasion of complement-mediated lysis, bacteria penetrate the nasopharyngeal epithelium into the bloodstream. Endotoxin (lipooligosaccharide) triggers a cytokine cascade (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) leading to increased blood\u2013brain barrier permeability and a neutrophil-predominant inflammatory response in the subarachnoid space. Elevated intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and neuronal injury result from both direct bacterial effects and host inflammatory mediators. Antibiotic prophylaxis eradicates organisms in the nasopharynx, halting transmission and preventing invasion into the bloodstream of contacts. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, rapidly sterilizing nasopharyngeal niches within hours of administration.","clinical_manifestation":"Invasive meningococcal disease typically presents with abrupt onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea/vomiting, and altered mental status. A petechial or purpuric rash occurs in 50\u201370% of cases and indicates endotoxemia. Case fatality is 10\u201315% in treated patients and up to 50% in fulminant cases with septic shock. Carriage is asymptomatic; close contacts of a case have a 500\u2013800-fold increased risk of invasive disease during the 7 days following exposure. Chemoprophylaxis reduces secondary attack rates from ~1.1% to <0.05%.","diagnostic_approach":"The index patient should undergo blood cultures and lumbar puncture. CSF analysis reveals neutrophilic pleocytosis (\u22651,000 cells/mm3), low glucose (<40 mg/dL), elevated protein (>100 mg/dL), and Gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain (sensitivity ~60\u201390%, specificity >95%). Culture confirmation and PCR for capsular gene loci (sodC, ctrA) allow serogroup determination. Contacts do not require diagnostic testing unless symptomatic; prophylaxis is based on exposure history. Pre-test probability of carriage in asymptomatic contacts can exceed 10%, making targeted chemoprophylaxis cost-effective (number needed to treat ~92 to prevent one secondary case).","management_principles":"Definitive therapy for meningococcal meningitis in the index case includes high-dose intravenous third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone 2 g q12h or cefotaxime 2 g q4\u20136h) plus adjunctive dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg q6h for 2\u20134 days) begun before or with the first antibiotic dose (AHA/IDSA 2016, Class I, Level A). Supportive care addresses raised intracranial pressure, shock, and coagulopathy. For contacts, chemoprophylaxis options: rifampin 600 mg PO q12h \u00d7 2 days (adults), rifampin 10 mg/kg PO q12h \u00d7 2 days (children), ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO \u00d7 1 dose (adults only), or ceftriaxone 250 mg IM \u00d7 1 dose (pregnant women). Ciprofloxacin\u2019s single-dose regimen yields >95% eradication of carriage at 24 hours with minimal adverse effects.","follow_up_guidelines":"After chemoprophylaxis, contacts do not require routine follow-up testing for carriage unless symptomatic. Index cases should have audiologic evaluation prior to discharge, as sensorineural hearing loss occurs in 10\u201320% of survivors. Neurological exams should assess for focal deficits. There is no role for repeat lumbar puncture if the patient is clinically improving. Vaccination against serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y is indicated for close contacts under 24 years or during outbreaks, ideally 2\u201310 weeks post-exposure to allow immune response without interference from prophylactic antibiotics.","clinical_pearls":"1. Single-dose ciprofloxacin (500 mg) eradicates nasopharyngeal carriage in >90% of adult contacts within 24 hours\u2014high compliance compared to rifampin. 2. Chemoprophylaxis must be administered as soon as a case is suspected; do not wait for laboratory confirmation. 3. Close contacts include household members, day-care contacts, and anyone with direct exposure to oral secretions; casual contacts do not require prophylaxis. 4. Isolation of index case for \u226524 hours after effective antibiotics prevents further droplet transmission; risk does not persist for two full days post-isolation. 5. Vaccination against serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y should follow chemoprophylaxis in high-risk contacts or during community outbreaks.","references":"1.
