[{"question_number":"6","question":"A patient with Parkinson's disease on multiple agents has developed hallucinations. What is the first step in management?","options":["Stop amantadine","Increase Sinemet dosage","Start quetiapine","Add rivastigmine"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Stop amantadine","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A, stop amantadine. Hallucinations in Parkinson\u2019s disease are often precipitated by dopaminergic and anticholinergic medications. Among these, amantadine has been implicated in inducing visual hallucinations (Rabey & Korczyn. Mov Disord. 2006;21(9):1395\u20131399). Reducing or discontinuing the offending agent is the first step before initiating antipsychotics. Increasing Sinemet (B) would likely worsen psychosis. Starting quetiapine (C) is a second-line measure after medication review. Adding rivastigmine (D) targets cognitive decline and visual hallucinations in PD dementia but is not first-line for isolated drug-induced psychosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Visual hallucinations in Parkinson\u2019s disease occur in 20\u201340% of patients and reflect a spectrum from minor illusions to formed visions. ICD-11 classifies PD psychosis under \u2018Behavioral and psychiatric disturbances associated with diseases classified elsewhere\u2019 (6A23). Differential diagnoses include Lewy body dementia, Charles Bonnet syndrome, and delirium. Hallucinations often emerge late in disease course or with polypharmacy. Neurobiologically, dopaminergic overstimulation of mesolimbic pathways and cholinergic deficiency in hallucinating circuits are implicated. Consensus guidelines recommend medication review prior to antipsychotic therapy.","pathophysiology":"Normal visual processing involves the dorsal and ventral visual streams modulated by balanced dopamine and acetylcholine signaling. In PD psychosis, excess dopaminergic stimulation in the mesolimbic system via D2 receptors and anticholinergic burden disrupt visual association areas in the parieto-occipital cortex. Amantadine\u2019s NMDA antagonism may further dysregulate glutamatergic excitatory\u2013inhibitory balance, provoking hallucinations. Discontinuing amantadine reduces NMDA blockade and dopaminergic tone, restoring neurotransmitter equilibrium. Quetiapine acts on 5-HT2A and D2 receptors but should follow medication reduction to minimize polypharmacy and adverse effects.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report formed visual hallucinations (people, animals) that are often nonthreatening and recognized as unreal. Episodes may occur in low light or during transitions to sleep (hypnagogic). Risk factors include dementia, REM sleep behavior disorder, and high dopaminergic load. Natural history shows progression to more frequent hallucinations and potential delirium without intervention. Diagnostic criteria for PD psychosis require recurrent or continuous hallucinations not attributable to other medical conditions. In PD dementia, hallucinations may persist despite medication adjustments.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes a detailed medication history and cognitive assessment (MoCA, MMSE). Rule out systemic causes (infection, metabolic disturbance) with basic labs (electrolytes, TSH). Neuroimaging (MRI) is second-tier to exclude stroke or mass lesions when atypical features appear. EEG is third-tier only if seizure-related visual phenomena are suspected. The pretest probability of drug-induced hallucinations in PD patients on amantadine is ~30%; drug cessation yields symptom resolution in 70% within one week.","management_principles":"Parkinson\u2019s Foundation guidelines recommend a stepwise approach: (1) reduce or discontinue nonessential medications starting with anticholinergics and amantadine (Level C). (2) If hallucinations persist, taper dopamine agonists, COMT inhibitors, and MAO-B inhibitors. (3) If psychosis continues, initiate quetiapine or clozapine (Class II, Level B) due to minimal impact on motor function. Rivastigmine may aid hallucinations in PD dementia but is third-line for isolated hallucinations. Monitoring for side effects\u2014orthostatic hypotension, sedation\u2014is essential when introducing antipsychotics.","follow_up_guidelines":"After amantadine cessation, reassess weekly for resolution of hallucinations. Monitor motor function as drug reduction may worsen rigidity or dyskinesias. If quetiapine is started, follow-up at two weeks to adjust dose (initial 12.5\u201325 mg nightly); evaluate metabolic parameters, QTc interval at one month. Cognitive evaluation every six months. Long-term, assess for progression to Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia and adjust cholinesterase inhibitors accordingly. Document hallucination frequency with a standardized hallucination rating scale.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always review and taper offending medications before starting antipsychotics in PD psychosis. 2. Amantadine is a common culprit for hallucinations due to NMDA antagonism. 3. Quetiapine is preferred over typical antipsychotics to avoid motor worsening. 4. Rivastigmine benefits PD dementia hallucinations but is not first-line for psychosis alone. 5. Recognize hypnagogic hallucinations as benign and part of PD psychosis spectrum.","references":"11. Rabey JM, Korczyn AD.

Propranolol. While clonazepam is first-line for orthostatic tremor, some patients intolerant of benzodiazepines derive benefit from nonselective \u03b2-blockers, particularly propranolol, which may reduce tremor amplitude during stance.

Multiple randomized trials (e.g., the ADAGIO study, 2010) have shown that adding amantadine at doses of 100\u2013200 mg daily reduces peak-dose dyskinesias by 30\u201350% (Level A evidence, AAN Practice Parameter 2018). Option A (Decrease Sinemet and add a dopamine agonist) risks worsening \u2018off\u2019 time and does not directly address peak-dose dyskinesia. Option B (Increase Sinemet dosage) would exacerbate dyskinesias. Option D (Stop all medications) is contraindicated and would precipitate akinetic crisis and severe Parkinsonism.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Levodopa remains the most effective symptomatic therapy. Over time, pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation leads to motor complications: wearing-off fluctuations and dyskinesias. Dyskinesias typically present as choreiform movements at peak levodopa effect. The classification of dyskinesia subtypes includes peak-dose, diphasic, and off-period dystonia. Peak-dose dyskinesia is most common and managed by adjusting levodopa pharmacodynamics or adding amantadine.","pathophysiology":"Normal basal ganglia physiology relies on balanced direct and indirect pathways modulated by dopamine. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, loss of nigrostriatal dopamine causes overactivity of the indirect pathway and underactivity of the direct pathway. Levodopa restores dopaminergic tone but pulsatile delivery leads to receptor sensitization and downstream maladaptive plasticity, resulting in peak-dose choreiform dyskinesias. Amantadine\u2019s NMDA antagonism dampens glutamatergic overactivity in the subthalamic nucleus\u2013globus pallidus network, reducing dyskinetic movements.","clinical_manifestation":"Levodopa-induced dyskinesias present as involuntary choreiform or dystonic movements, often involving limbs, trunk, or orofacial muscles, peaking 60\u201390 minutes post-dose. Up to 40% of patients develop dyskinesias within 5 years of levodopa therapy. Patients describe a \u2018peak-dose dance.\u2019 Physical exam confirms choreoathetoid movements that abate as levodopa levels fall.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on history and observation of timing relative to levodopa dosing. Video recording can aid assessment. Rating scales such as the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) quantify severity. No routine imaging or labs are required.","management_principles":"First-line for peak-dose dyskinesia: add amantadine 100\u2013200 mg daily (Evidence Class I, Level A). Alternative strategies include fractionating levodopa doses, using extended-release formulations, or adding a COMT inhibitor to smooth levodopa levels. Dopamine agonists may be used but are less effective for peak dyskinesia. Deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) is third-line for refractory dyskinesia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor dyskinesia severity at each visit using UDysRS. After starting amantadine, reassess after 4\u20136 weeks. Watch for amantadine side effects (livedo reticularis, hallucinations).

The prevalence among long-term antipsychotic users is 20\u201330% (Meta-analysis, 2015). Option B (Parkinson\u2019s disease) is incorrect because PD manifests with bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor, not stereotyped oro-buccal movements after neuroleptic use.
