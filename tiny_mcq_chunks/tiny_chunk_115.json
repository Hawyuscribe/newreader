The posterior cerebral artery (PCA), posterior communicating artery (PCom), and superior cerebellar artery (SCA) supply other territories (midbrain, thalamus, cerebellum) and are not implicated in medial medullary infarcts.","conceptual_foundation":"The anterior spinal artery originates from the vertebral arteries and travels along the ventral surface of the spinal cord and medulla. Its paramedian branches supply the pyramid (corticospinal tract), medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nucleus/fibers in the medial medulla. Infarction leads to characteristic motor and sensory deficits.","pathophysiology":"Thromboembolic or atherosclerotic occlusion of the paramedian perforators of the ASA results in ischemia of the ventromedial medulla. Loss of corticospinal tract fibers causes contralateral hemiparesis; damage to the medial lemniscus causes contralateral loss of proprioception and vibration; involvement of hypoglossal fibers produces ipsilateral tongue weakness.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely with contralateral spastic paresis of arm and leg, contralateral loss of position and vibration sense, and ipsilateral tongue deviation toward the lesion. Pain and temperature sensation are preserved (spinothalamic tracts lie laterally).","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging shows medial medullary infarction. MRA or CTA may identify ASA occlusion, though the small caliber of paramedian branches often precludes direct visualization. Clinical localization is usually sufficient for diagnosis.","management_principles":"Follow acute ischemic stroke protocols: administer IV thrombolysis if within 4.5 hours and no contraindications. Begin antiplatelet therapy, statin therapy, and optimize blood pressure. Early initiation of physical and speech therapy is crucial.","follow_up_guidelines":"Implement multidisciplinary rehabilitation including physiotherapy and speech/swallow evaluation. Monitor for complications such as aspiration pneumonia. Secondary prevention with high-intensity statin and antiplatelet agent; address vascular risk factors.","clinical_pearls":"1. Ipsilateral tongue deviation is pathognomonic for hypoglossal involvement. 2. Differentiate from lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome\u2014no nucleus ambiguus involvement, no dysphagia. 3.

Carotid endarterectomy or stenting offers marginal benefit in moderate stenosis and carries procedural risks. Anticoagulation is not indicated for atherosclerotic stenosis without other embolic sources.","conceptual_foundation":"Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is stratified by degree: moderate (50\u201369%) and severe (\u226570%). Large randomized trials (ACAS, ACST) showed that benefit of endarterectomy over medical therapy in moderate stenosis is minimal when modern risk factor control is applied. Optimal medical therapy includes antiplatelet agents, statins, antihypertensives, glycemic control, and lifestyle modification.","pathophysiology":"Atherosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid bifurcation narrows the lumen, reducing cerebral perfusion reserve and posing an embolic risk. Risk factors include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and diabetes. Plaque rupture can lead to distal microembolization and cortical infarcts.","clinical_manifestation":"Most patients are asymptomatic until plaque instability causes transient ischemic attacks or non-disabling strokes. In this case, the patient has no focal neurologic deficits, indicating stable plaque without recent embolic events.","diagnostic_approach":"Duplex ultrasound is first-line for stenosis quantification.

Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) commonly presents with headache, papilledema, seizures, and normal to mildly abnormal CSF (e.g., 5 cells, slight protein elevation). In SLE patients on dialysis, prothrombotic risk increases. PRES (C) typically requires severe hypertension; SLE cerebritis (B) and HSV encephalitis (D) present with fever, marked CSF pleocytosis, or psychosis rather than isolated papilledema and mild CSF changes.","conceptual_foundation":"CVT involves thrombosis of dural sinuses or cortical veins, leading to impaired venous drainage, raised intracranial pressure, and focal lesions. Risk factors include SLE, nephrotic syndrome, and renal replacement therapy. Recognition relies on understanding venous anatomy and prothrombotic states.","pathophysiology":"Thrombosis in cerebral veins causes increased venous pressure, blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, and vasogenic edema. Elevated intracranial pressure leads to papilledema and headache. Seizures occur due to cortical irritation by edema or venous infarction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with progressive headache (>95%), seizures (40\u201350%), papilledema (30%), focal deficits (25%). Onset may be subacute over days. CSF is often normal or shows mild protein elevation.","diagnostic_approach":"Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is the gold standard, showing absence of flow in affected sinuses. CT venogram is an alternative. Fundoscopy confirms papilledema. LP is performed only after ruling out mass lesion.","management_principles":"Immediate anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) regardless of hemorrhagic infarction. Transition to warfarin or DOAC for at least 3\u20136 months.

In perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (P-SAH) with negative angiography, vasospasm remains the principal risk despite absence of aneurysm. Nimodipine, a calcium-channel antagonist, has Class I recommendation from AHA/ASA 2012 guidelines for all SAH patients to reduce delayed cerebral ischemia (Grade A evidence). Randomized trials show a 40% relative risk reduction in poor outcome with nimodipine (Hazard Ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.45\u20130.80).\n\nOption A (Repeat DSA): Two high-quality DSAs spaced 14 days apart make a missed aneurysm extremely unlikely; repeat angiography beyond this adds minimal yield (<2%) and increases procedural risk. Option B (Reassurance and discharge): Discharge without nimodipine neglects proven prophylaxis against vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia. Option C (Surgical exploration): In absence of angiographic lesion or mass effect, invasive exploration is contraindicated and not supported by any guideline or trial data.","conceptual_foundation":"Perimesencephalic SAH is a distinct clinicopathologic entity characterized by blood localized around the midbrain cisterns. It accounts for ~10% of nontraumatic SAH. Unlike aneurysmal SAH, P-SAH is nonaneurysmal and has a benign course: rebleeding <1%, hydrocephalus ~5%, and vasospasm-related infarcts in ~5\u201310%. ICD-11 classifies SAH under I60. Differential includes aneurysmal SAH, cerebral venous thrombosis, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Embryologically, perimesencephalic cisterns derive from the subarachnoid space around the midbrain, supplied by branches of the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebrovascular tone is regulated by intracellular calcium flux in smooth muscle cells. In SAH, oxyhemoglobin and inflammatory mediators trigger sustained vasoconstriction via L-type calcium channel activation and endothelin upregulation. Nimodipine crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier, blocking L-type channels, reducing intracellular calcium and mitigating vasospasm. In P-SAH, absence of aneurysm limits rebleeding but blood breakdown products still provoke vasospasm weeks after initial bleed.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with a sudden thunderclap headache, often described as the worst headache of life, without focal deficit. In P-SAH, CT shows blood confined to the perimesencephalic cistern with no extension into the sylvian fissure or ventricles. Neurologic exam is typically normal. Vasospasm may manifest on days 3\u201314 with focal deficits or delayed ischemia. Hydrocephalus is uncommon but should be monitored.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier imaging: Noncontrast CT is diagnostic in >95% within 24 hrs. If CT is negative but suspicion remains, lumbar puncture should be performed. Once SAH is confirmed, CTA or DSA is indicated. In P-SAH, DSA yield of aneurysm is <2% after two negative studies. Transcranial Doppler can monitor for vasospasm noninvasively (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~75%).","management_principles":"All SAH patients require nimodipine 60 mg orally every 4 hrs for 21 days to reduce delayed cerebral ischemia (Class I, Level A). Maintain euvolemia and normotension; avoid prophylactic hyperdynamic therapy unless vasospasm is documented. Monitor in ICU for 10\u201314 days with serial neurologic exams and TCD. No role for steroids or invasive angioplasty in asymptomatic P-SAH.","follow_up_guidelines":"Outpatient follow-up at 3 months to assess cognitive and functional recovery. No further angiography is needed unless new symptoms arise. Monitor blood pressure and avoid anticoagulants for at least 3 weeks. Educate on headache management and warning signs of delayed ischemia.","clinical_pearls":"1. P-SAH carries <1% rebleeding risk but still warrants nimodipine to prevent vasospasm. 2. Two negative DSAs separated by \u226510 days virtually excludes aneurysm. 3. TCD is useful for vasospasm surveillance (thresholds: MCA mean velocity >120 cm/s). 4. Hydrocephalus is rare\u2014monitor clinically rather than routinely place EVD. 5. Patient education on headache patterns and when to return is critical.","references":"[1] Connolly ES Jr et al.
