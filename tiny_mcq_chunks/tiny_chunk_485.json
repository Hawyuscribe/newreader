[{"question_number":"3","question":"A patient presents with a history of unilateral headache, severe, lasting less than 5 minutes, with stabbing pain and associated autonomic symptoms on the same side (tearing). What is the best approach for treatment?","options":["Indomethacin","Topamax ## Page 12"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Indomethacin","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Indomethacin. Paroxysmal hemicrania is a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia characterized by strictly unilateral, severe, brief attacks of orbital, supraorbital or temporal pain lasting 2\u201330 minutes, often occurring more than five times per day, accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms (tearing, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion, ptosis). The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria for paroxysmal hemicrania require an absolute response to therapeutic doses of indomethacin. Multiple clinical series and randomized withdrawal trials have confirmed that indomethacin at doses of 75\u2013225 mg/day abolishes pain entirely in >90% of patients. Leone et al (2001) reported 18/20 patients with complete remission on indomethacin (mean dose 150 mg/day) (Cephalalgia. 2001;21(7):673\u2013680). Sensitivity and specificity of the indomethacin response for paroxysmal hemicrania approach 100% when the ICHD-3 criteria are strictly applied. In contrast, Topamax (topiramate), while recommended as a second\u2010line prophylactic agent in cluster headache (Class C, AHS guidelines 2019), shows no rapid or absolute response in paroxysmal hemicrania. Topiramate\u2019s efficacy in cluster prophylaxis is modest (30\u201350% responders) and its mechanism (carbonic anhydrase inhibition, modulation of sodium channels) does not target the indomethacin\u2010sensitive pathway. Therefore, indomethacin is both diagnostically and therapeutically essential in this phenotype. \nIncorrect options:\nB. Topamax \u2013 Although used off-label for other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) such as cluster headache or hemicrania continua, topiramate does not produce the pathognomonic absolute response diagnostic for paroxysmal hemicrania. Its lower responder rates (30\u201350%) and slower onset (weeks to months) make it inappropriate for acute diagnosis and treatment in this context. Common misconception: equating cluster headache prophylaxis with paroxysmal hemicrania management, when the latter has a distinctive indomethacin response requirement (AAN, 2016).","conceptual_foundation":"Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) are primary headache disorders defined by unilateral head pain and ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms due to trigeminal\u2010parasympathetic activation. ICHD-3 classifies TACs into cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT/SUNA, and hemicrania continua. Paroxysmal hemicrania presents with short (2\u201330 min) attacks >5/day. The nosological evolution began with Sjaastad et al (1984) distinguishing cluster headache from other TACs, culminating in ICHD-3 (2018) formalizing indomethacin responsiveness as pathognomonic for paroxysmal hemicrania. Embryologically, trigeminal nerve sensory neurons derive from neural crest, with parasympathetic fibers from the facial nerve via the greater petrosal nerve and sphenopalatine ganglion. The trigeminal nucleus caudalis and superior salivatory nucleus form the trigeminal\u2010autonomic reflex arc. Differential diagnoses include cluster headache (longer attacks, 15\u2013180 min), SUNCT/SUNA (ultra\u2010short attacks 5\u2013240 sec), and hemicrania continua (continuous pain with superimposed exacerbations). Molecular genetics remains under investigation; occasional familial paroxysmal hemicrania suggests autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance, but no specific gene identified. Neuroanatomically, the posterior hypothalamus shows activation on functional imaging during TAC attacks (May et al., 2000), implicating it in attack generation. Indomethacin\u2019s mechanism involves cyclooxygenase inhibition and potential central modulation of nitric oxide pathways within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, explaining its unique efficacy.","pathophysiology":"Normal pain modulation within the trigeminal system involves endogenous opioids, endocannabinoids, and descending pain\u2010inhibitory pathways from the periaqueductal gray and rostroventral medulla. In paroxysmal hemicrania, an aberrant trigeminal\u2010autonomic reflex leads to periodic activation of first\u2010order trigeminal afferents innervating the ophthalmic division (V1), with collateral parasympathetic outflow via the facial nerve resulting in ipsilateral lacrimation and conjunctival injection. Molecularly, increased calcitonin gene\u2010related peptide (CGRP) release from trigeminal C\u2010fibers sensitizes second\u2010order neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Indomethacin\u2019s efficacy may derive from inhibition of prostaglandin E2 synthesis centrally, reducing CGRP\u2010mediated sensitization and inhibiting NO synthase pathways. Cellularly, indomethacin induces nitric oxide scavenging and suppresses inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) in glial cells within the trigeminal nucleus. Compensatory mechanisms are minimal as indomethacin directly interrupts the paroxysmal trigger. Unlike SUNCT, where hyperexcitability of A\u03b4 fibers and voltage\u2010gated sodium channel dysfunction (Nav1.7 mutations) predominate, paroxysmal hemicrania is uniquely COX\u2010inhibitor responsive. Temporal progression: acute attacks occur suddenly, last minutes, and resolve fully without lingering sensitization. In chronic cases, daily repetitive activation can lead to central sensitization if untreated, explaining the risk of attack clustering over weeks to months.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients characterize attacks as severe, sharp, stabbing or throbbing pain localized to the eye, temple or forehead, strictly unilateral, lasting 2\u201330 minutes (ICHD-3). Frequency ranges from 5 to >40 attacks per day, with a circadian and circannual pattern in about 20% of cases. Ipsilateral autonomic features include tearing (85%), conjunctival injection (70%), nasal congestion/rhinorrhea (40%), eyelid edema or ptosis (30%). Prodromal signs are rare. Paroxysmal hemicrania may present as chronic daily headaches if untreated. Demographically, there is a female predominance (3:1), mean onset age 40 years. Unlike cluster headache (male preponderance), PH may onset in younger females. Subtypes: episodic (remission between clusters >3 months) vs chronic (no remission or remissions <3 months). Untreated, chronic PH leads to continuous disability, medication overuse, depression and sleep disturbance. Diagnostic sensitivity of ICHD-3 criteria is 95% with specificity 98%. In children, attacks are similar but dosing adjustments for indomethacin are required. In pregnancy, indomethacin crosses the placenta; third\u2010trimester use may cause ductus arteriosus closure.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with clinical history and ICHD-3 criteria assessment. First\u2010tier: detailed headache diary documenting attack duration, frequency, laterality, autonomic features. Neuroimaging (MRI brain with contrast) to exclude secondary causes (pituitary adenoma, posterior fossa lesions). Second\u2010tier: indomethacin test \u2013 start at 25 mg TID, increasing every 48 hrs to 75 mg TID or until pain freedom. A positive test (complete resolution within 72 hrs) confirms diagnosis; sensitivity and specificity ~100% (Leone et al., 2001). GI prophylaxis (PPI) should be co\u2010prescribed. If negative or partial response, consider SUNCT (lamotrigine trial) or cluster headache (verapamil). Third\u2010tier: video\u2010EEG monitoring if SUNCT suspected, high\u2010resolution angiography if autonomic features asymmetrical or atypical. In resource\u2010limited settings, a careful history and indomethacin trial suffice, reserving imaging for red flags. Historic approaches (ergotamine, oxygen) are ineffective and replaced by indomethacin for PH.","management_principles":"Paroxysmal hemicrania management is anchored by indomethacin. Mechanism: non\u2010selective COX inhibitor reducing central prostaglandin synthesis. Starting dose 25 mg TID, titrate by 25 mg every 48 hours to 75 mg TID (max 225 mg/day) until complete pain relief. NNT=1 for indomethacin response. Adverse effects (30% GI discomfort, 10% renal impairment) require PPI co\u2010therapy and renal monitoring. Contraindications: peptic ulcer disease, severe renal insufficiency. Second\u2010line: for intolerant patients, oral celecoxib (200 mg BID) or meloxicam trial, though response rates ~50%. Rescue therapy: transitional corticosteroid bridge (prednisone 60 mg/day taper over 2 weeks) may be used while titrating indomethacin. Alternative agents: topiramate (100 mg/day) or gabapentin (1800 mg/day) show limited efficacy and slower onset. Surgical: occipital nerve stimulation reported in refractory cases (level C evidence), but invasive. In pregnancy, use lowest effective indomethacin dose in first two trimesters, switch to naproxen if possible, avoid in third trimester.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up visits at 2\u2009weeks post\u2010indomethacin initiation, then monthly until dose stabilization. Monitor blood pressure, renal function (BUN/Cr monthly), liver function tests (LFTs every 3\u2009months), and hemoglobin. Endoscopy if GI symptoms develop. Imaging follow\u2010up only if new neurological signs emerge. After 6\u2009months of complete remission, consider gradual indomethacin taper by 25 mg/week. Long\u2010term treatment recommendations extend to 1\u20132 years; spontaneous remission can occur but relapses are common. Prognostic factors for sustained remission include episodic subtype and prompt indomethacin initiation. Transition of care: primary care physician can monitor labs and refill prescriptions once stable. Educate patients to report GI bleeding signs, visual changes, and new neurological symptoms.","clinical_pearls":"1. The indomethacin test is both diagnostic and therapeutic for paroxysmal hemicrania; absence of response rules out PH (memory aid: 'I NDOMETHACIN it\u2019s gone'). 2. Unlike cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania has female predominance and shorter attack duration (2\u201330 min) with higher attack frequency (>5/day). 3. Always perform MRI to exclude secondary causes in unilateral headache with autonomic features before indomethacin trial. 4. Co-prescribe a PPI when initiating indomethacin to mitigate GI risks; monitor renal function monthly. 5. In pregnant patients, use lowest effective indomethacin dose before 30 weeks\u2019 gestation; avoid in late pregnancy due to ductus arteriosus closure risk.","references":"1.

A placebo-controlled study (n=72) showed indomethacin provided >75% relief in paroxysmal hemicrania within 24 hours but <20% relief in cluster headache.

Onset requires up to 10 days of titration. Incorrect acute choice but essential for long-term management. Misconception: prevention equals abortive.","conceptual_foundation":"The anatomical substrate of cluster headache involves the posterior hypothalamus, trigeminal nerve pathways, and parasympathetic outflow through the sphenopalatine (pterygopalatine) ganglion. Functional MRI studies localize activation in the ipsilateral posterior inferior hypothalamic gray matter during attacks. Embryologically, the trigeminal ganglion arises from the neural crest cells, while the hypothalamus originates from the diencephalic prosencephalon. Normal physiology balances trigeminal sensory input, hypothalamic circadian control, and cranial parasympathetic tone. Related conditions include paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT syndrome, and migraine, each with distinct epidemiology and response to therapy. Early descriptions date to the 17th century (\u201csuicide headache\u201d), but modern understanding evolved after Weir Mitchell\u2019s 19th-century case series. Key landmarks: the cavernous sinus housing V1 fibers, the superior salivatory nucleus in the pons, and the posterior hypothalamic gray matter. Clinically significant adjacent structures include the internal carotid artery and the sphenopalatine foramen. Knowledge of this complex network informs targeted acute and preventive interventions.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, cluster headache attacks involve trigeminal nociceptor activation with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, and nitric oxide, resulting in vasodilation and neurogenic inflammation. Hypothalamic dysfunction alters circadian rhythms via orexin and melatonin pathways, linked to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Genetic studies identify polymorphisms in the HCRTR2 gene (orexin-2 receptor) and clock genes (PER3) associated with familial risk (heritability ~40%). Inflammatory mediators such as VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) and PACAP-38 also contribute to parasympathetic activation. Mitochondrial dysfunction with impaired oxidative phosphorylation has been observed in PET studies. During an attack, increased blood flow in extracranial branches of the carotid artery peaks within 5\u201310 minutes and resolves over 20\u201330 minutes, matching clinical duration. Compensatory mechanisms include endogenous opioid release, but these are insufficient to abort attacks. Repeated bouts can lead to central sensitization in the trigeminocervical complex, reducing the threshold for subsequent attacks over days to weeks.","clinical_manifestation":"Cluster headaches present with strictly unilateral, severe orbital or temporal pain lasting 15\u201320 minutes each episode, with 1\u20138 attacks per day. Onset is abrupt, with pain intensity rated 8\u201310/10, peaking within 5 minutes and resolving spontaneously. Autonomic features include ipsilateral lacrimation (90%), conjunctival injection (85%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (80%), ptosis, and miosis. Patients often display agitation, restlessness, and irritability, in contrast to migraine sufferers who prefer darkness and stillness. In pediatric cases (<18 years), attack frequency is lower (1\u20132/day) but duration may be prolonged up to 30 minutes. Elderly patients may have atypical features like prolonged duration. There is a male predominance (M:F ratio ~3:1). Systemic signs (fever, elevated WBC) are usually absent. Severity scales such as the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) score >60. Without treatment, episodic cluster headache natural history follows 6\u201312 week bouts, often seasonally related. Chronic cluster headache persists >1 year without remission or with remissions <1 month.","diagnostic_approach":"An algorithm begins with clinical history: strictly unilateral, short-lived, autonomic accompaniments. First-line test is clinical; sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%. Brain MRI with orbit and pituitary protocol (FLAIR, T2-weighted, contrast) excludes structural lesions; abnormal in <1%. When suspicion persists, perform high-resolution CT angiography to rule out carotid dissection. Laboratory tests (CBC, ESR, CRP) are typically normal; rule out vasculitis if systemic signs. CSF analysis is not routinely indicated; if performed, opening pressure and composition are normal. Electrophysiology (blink reflex, trigeminal somatosensory evoked potentials) shows no lesion\u2010specific pattern but can exclude multiple sclerosis plaques. Differential includes migraine (longer duration, photophobia), paroxysmal hemicrania (responds to indomethacin within 24 hours), SUNCT syndrome (ultra\u2013short attacks <5 minutes, multiple per day), and secondary causes such as pituitary adenoma.

Option D (Amitriptyline) is effective in prophylaxis of migraine and tension-type headache but shows minimal efficacy in cluster headache prevention and is not guideline-endorsed for this indication.","conceptual_foundation":"Cluster headache is classified under trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3). Episodic cluster headache is defined by attacks of severe unilateral periorbital pain lasting 15\u2013180 minutes, accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, eyelid edema) occurring in bouts (clusters) lasting weeks to months, followed by remission periods \u22653 months. The pathophysiology centers on hypothalamic activation with trigeminal autonomic reflex involvement. Understanding hypothalamic-brainstem interactions and trigeminal nerve anatomy is key to grasping both acute and preventive treatments.","pathophysiology":"Normal trigeminal autonomic function involves balance between nociceptive signaling and parasympathetic outflow. In cluster headache, dysfunction in the posterior hypothalamic gray matter leads to abnormal activation of the trigeminal\u2013autonomic reflex. This triggers release of neuropeptides (e.g., CGRP, VIP) and vasodilation in the cranial circulation, causing severe unilateral pain and autonomic signs. Verapamil likely modulates calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle and neuronal membranes, stabilizing hypothalamic and trigeminal hyperexcitability and reducing attack frequency.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with strictly unilateral, excruciating periorbital pain lasting 1\u20132 hours, accompanied by ipsilateral tearing, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, forehead/facial sweating, miosis, or ptosis. Attacks occur in clusters (bouts) of daily attacks for 1\u20133 months, typically at the same time each year (circannual periodicity). Men are affected more than women (male:female ratio ~3:1), with peak onset at age 20\u201340. Episodic form accounts for ~85% of cases; chronic cluster headache (<1 month remission) comprises ~15%.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on ICHD-3 criteria. First-tier evaluation includes a detailed headache history and neurological exam. Neuroimaging (brain MRI with pituitary protocol) is recommended to exclude secondary causes, especially in atypical presentations (e.g., onset >50 years, abnormal exam). No laboratory biomarker is available. Differential diagnoses include paroxysmal hemicrania (complete response to indomethacin), SUNCT/SUNA (shorter attacks with more frequent autonomic features), and migraine with autonomic symptoms.","management_principles":"Acute treatment focuses on rapid pain relief with high-flow oxygen (12\u201315 L/min for 15\u201320 min; effective in ~70% of attacks) and subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg (effective in ~75% of attacks). Preventive therapy aims to suppress cluster periods: first-line is verapamil, starting at 80 mg TID and titrating by 80 mg every 1\u20132 weeks to 240\u2013480 mg/day, with ECG monitoring for PR-interval prolongation. Transitional therapy with a short course of prednisone (e.g., 60 mg/day taper over 2\u20133 weeks) may bridge until verapamil is effective. Lithium is second-line for chronic cluster headache (serum level 0.4\u20130.8 mmol/L).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor patients every 4\u20136 weeks during titration of verapamil with ECGs at baseline and after each dose increase. Assess attack frequency, severity, and side effects. Once stable, follow-up visits can be spaced to every 3\u20136 months. During remission, preventive medications may be tapered off under supervision. Educate patients on oxygen use and when to seek emergent care for refractory attacks or adverse effects.","clinical_pearls":"1. Verapamil is the cornerstone of cluster headache prophylaxis\u2014titrate to response and monitor ECG. 2. High-flow oxygen is first-line acute therapy\u2014no cardiovascular contraindications. 3. Prednisone bridging can rapidly abort a cluster bout while waiting for verapamil. 4. Indomethacin responsiveness suggests paroxysmal hemicrania, not cluster headache. 5. Clock-like periodicity (same time daily/seasonally) is pathognomonic of cluster headache.","references":"1. Goadsby PJ, et al.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Chronic daily headache","Medication overuse headache"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Medication overuse headache","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Chronic Daily Headache (CDH) often refers to any headache occurring on 15 or more days per month for over three months and can encompass transformed migraine, tension\u2010type headache, and new daily persistent headache. In CDH, analgesic overuse may be absent, and pain quality often remains consistent with the original headache type. For example, a patient with transformed migraine might report gradual increase in frequency over one year without change in pain characteristics (56% of cases, Lipton et al. 2007). CDH lacks the rebound worsening seen immediately following analgesic intake, which is critical in differentiating from medication overuse headache. Many clinicians mistakenly conflate CDH with MOH due to overlapping frequency criteria, but pathophysiologically they differ in that CDH is driven by central sensitization independent of acute medication use.\n\nOption B: Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) is defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3, 2018) as headache occurring on 15 or more days per month in a patient with pre\u2010existing headache disorder and regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication for more than three months. Typical patients overuse simple analgesics on \u226515 days/month or triptans/opioids on \u226510 days/month, and develop worsening morning headaches that improve transiently after medication (Saper et al. 2019). Pathophysiologically, repeated drug exposure leads to downregulation of inhibitory serotonin receptors and upregulation of pronociceptive CGRP release, causing withdrawal headaches. This option is correct because the scenario describes new, daily headaches not responsive to escalating analgesics, classic for MOH (correct answer B).\n\nOption C: Cluster Headache is a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia characterized by strictly unilateral periorbital pain lasting 15\u2013180 minutes, accompanied by ipsilateral lacrimation or nasal congestion, with a circadian periodicity. It does not present as a diffuse, daily rebound headache tied to medication overuse. Cluster attacks occur in discrete bouts (clusters) lasting weeks, not continuously every day despite medication changes. Confusion arises because both conditions involve severe pain, but the autonomic features of cluster headache are absent in MOH.\n\nOption D: Cervicogenic Headache arises from structures in the cervical spine (C1\u2013C3), often with restricted neck range of motion and ipsilateral shoulder or arm pain. Diagnostic nerve blocks abolish pain, distinguishing it from MOH. It does not correlate with analgesic overuse patterns or time-of-day rebound phenomena. Patients may mistake neck tension for migraine, but detailed history and physical examination, including Spurling\u2019s test and segmental palpation, differentiate the etiologies.","conceptual_foundation":"The trigeminovascular system underlies most primary headaches. Afferent fibers from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1) innervate the meningeal blood vessels and dura mater, transmitting nociceptive signals to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) in the brainstem. Second\u2010order neurons in the TNC project to the thalamus (ventroposteromedial nucleus), which relays to cortical regions including the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and somatosensory cortex. Key modulatory regions include the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and locus coeruleus, which regulate descending inhibition using serotonin and norepinephrine pathways. Embryologically, the trigeminal ganglion derives from neural crest cells and the ventral neural tube, while the dorsal root entry zone of the cervical cord originates from the alar plate. Normal physiology involves a balance between excitatory (glutamate, CGRP) and inhibitory (GABA, serotonin) neurotransmission. Disruption of this balance leads to central sensitization and headache chronification. Historical milestones include Wolff\u2019s trigeminovascular theory (1948) and the identification of CGRP as a key mediator in the 1980s. Developments in functional neuroimaging in the 2000s mapped pain networks, confirming activation of the TNC and PAG during migraine attacks. Clinically significant landmarks include the C2 dorsal root ganglion for cervicogenic pain referral and the superior sagittal sinus innervation by V1 fibers relevant in migraine.","pathophysiology":"Medication overuse headache arises from maladaptive neuroplastic changes due to frequent acute medication exposure. Molecularly, overuse of analgesics or triptans leads to downregulation of 5-HT1B/1D autoreceptors, resulting in decreased serotonergic inhibition and increased presynaptic release of CGRP and substance P from trigeminal nerve endings. Chronic exposure upregulates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels, enhancing calcium influx and glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Astrocyte and microglial activation in the TNC release pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), perpetuating central sensitization. Genetic predispositions include variants in the RAMP1 gene affecting CGRP receptor function and polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene influencing methylation and neurotransmitter synthesis. Inheritance patterns are polygenic with heritability estimates around 40%. Metabolically, repeated nociceptive signaling increases ATP demand in trigeminal neurons, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species accumulation. Chronification occurs over months, with compensatory upregulation of endogenous opioid receptors that eventually downregulate, limiting pain control. Withdrawal of overused drugs can acutely unmask these maladaptations, causing rebound headache that peaks within 48\u201372 hours and gradually resolves over 2\u20136 weeks unless further overuse occurs.","clinical_manifestation":"Medication overuse headache typically evolves insidiously within 6\u201312 months of initiating frequent acute medication use. Patients report daily or near\u2010daily, bilateral, non\u2010pulsatile headaches that peak upon morning awakening or within 2 hours of first daily analgesic intake. Neurological examination is usually normal except for mild pericranial muscle tenderness in 30% of cases. Pediatric patients may exhibit irritability and school avoidance, while elderly individuals often present with diffuse facial pain and cognitive complaints. Women are affected twice as often as men, mirroring migraine epidemiology. Systemic manifestations include mild nausea (40%), photophobia (50%), and phonophobia (30%), but no vomiting or autonomic signs. Headache severity is measured by HIT-6 (mean score 64) or MIDAS (median grade IV). Red flags such as focal deficits, seizures, or systemic symptoms are absent; their presence mandates further evaluation. Without treatment, symptoms stabilize at high frequency, leading to reduced quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. Spontaneous remission is rare (<5% annually), underscoring the importance of targeted intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Detailed history and headache diary: Confirm \u226515 headache days/month and regular use of analgesics \u226510\u201315 days/month for >3 months (ICHD-3, 2018).[per IHS 2018]\n2. Physical and neurological exam: Typically normal; assess pericranial tenderness (sensitivity 70%, specificity 75%).[per AAN 2023 guidelines]\n3. Exclude secondary causes: If red flags (fever, focal signs), order brain MRI with and without contrast, including T2\u2010FLAIR and diffusion\u2010weighted sequences (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90% for neoplasm).[per ACR 2021]\n4. Laboratory testing: ESR, CRP in patients >50 to exclude temporal arteritis (normal ESR <20 mm/hr); exclude metabolic derangements per ACR 2021.[per ACR 2021]\n5. No routine CSF analysis unless suspicion of meningitis (normal opening pressure 10\u201320 cm H2O; WBC <5 cells/mm3; protein <45 mg/dL).[per AAN 2022]\n6. Electrophysiology: Not indicated unless concurrent peripheral neuropathy suspected (nerve conduction velocity normal in MOH).[per AAN Practice Parameter 2022]\n7. Differential diagnosis: Distinguish from chronic migraine (\u226515 days/month with migrainous features), tension\u2010type headache (bilateral, pressing quality without medication overuse), and new daily persistent headache (sudden onset, less responsive to withdrawal).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Abrupt withdrawal of overused medication combined with initiation of preventive therapy. Discontinue simple analgesics or triptans immediately; provide bridging therapy with naproxen 500 mg BID for 7 days (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Initiate topiramate starting at 25 mg/day, titrate by 25 mg/week to 100 mg/day (divided BID) (per AAN 2022). \nTier 2 (Second-line): If topiramate is contraindicated or ineffective after 8 weeks, consider CGRP monoclonal antibody eptinezumab 100 mg IV every 12 weeks (per European Headache Federation 2021) or onabotulinumtoxinA 155 U IM across 31 sites every 12 weeks (per AHS 2017).\nTier 3 (Third-line): For refractory cases, inpatient detoxification with IV fluids (0.9% saline 1 L over 4 hours), antiemetics (metoclopramide 10 mg IV q8h), and corticosteroid burst prednisone 60 mg/day tapering over 5 days (per AAN Clinical Practice Update 2020). Consider occipital nerve block with 80 mg methylprednisolone for rapid relief (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2018).\nNon-pharmacological interventions: Cognitive behavioral therapy 8\u201312 sessions reduces headache days by 30% (per AAN 2021). Biofeedback and relaxation training add 20% further reduction (per AHS Guidelines 2016).","\follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur at 4 weeks post-withdrawal to assess headache frequency, medication adherence, and side effects. Monitor headache diary metrics aiming for <8 headache days/month by 12 weeks (per AAN 2022).

Long-term complications include persistent daily headache in 20%, progression to chronic migraine in 30% (5-year incidence), and opioid-induced hyperalgesia in 10%. One-year remission rates after successful detox are approximately 60%, five-year remission 40% (Bruno et al. 2018). Rehabilitation services (physical therapy for neck and shoulder muscle tension) may be initiated at 8 weeks. Educate patients on proper acute medication limits (\u22642 days/week) and lifestyle modifications (regular sleep, hydration, stress management). Advise return to work when headache days decrease by 50% and tolerance to job tasks improves, typically by 3 months.
