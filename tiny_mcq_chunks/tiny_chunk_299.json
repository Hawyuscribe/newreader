DMPK. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. Option A (CAG repeat) is characteristic of polyglutamine disorders such as Huntington disease and several spinocerebellar ataxias, not DM1. Option B (CTG repeat) names the trinucleotide sequence but does not identify the gene itself; the CTG expansion occurs within DMPK. Option D (AR, androgen receptor) is mutated in Kennedy disease (spinal bulbar muscular atrophy), another neuromuscular disorder but not myotonic dystrophy. Multiple molecular studies (Brook et al. 1992, Fu et al. 1992) established that expanded CTG repeats in DMPK lead to toxic RNA gain-of-function and spliceopathy, correlating with disease severity. The sensitivity of genetic testing for DMPK CTG expansions approaches 100% for clinical DM1 when repeat length >50 (Harper 2001).","conceptual_foundation":"Myotonic dystrophy falls within the group of muscular dystrophies (ICD-11: FC10.1). It is the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy. DM1 exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance and anticipation due to intergenerational CTG repeat expansion. Embryologically, DMPK is expressed in muscle and heart derived from paraxial mesoderm. Neuroanatomically, DM1 affects skeletal muscle membrane excitability via mis-splicing of chloride channel ClCN1 and insulin receptor pre-mRNA. The DMPK protein is a serine/threonine kinase whose normal role includes regulation of muscle differentiation and membrane integrity. The expanded CTG repeat in DMPK leads to sequestration of MBNL1 and functional upregulation of CELF1, altering alternative splicing throughout multiple tissues, hence the multisystem phenotype (Brook et al. 1992; Charlesworth et al. 2013).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, DMPK kinase regulates intracellular signaling in muscle fibers. In DM1, CTG repeats >50 form stable hairpin RNA structures that accumulate in nuclei, sequestering muscleblind-like (MBNL) splicing factors. Reduced MBNL activity and increased CELF1 cause missplicing of key transcripts (e.g., ClCN1, INSR), leading to myotonia, insulin resistance, cataracts, and cardiac conduction defects. MBNL1 depletion also disrupts alternative polyadenylation and miRNA processing. The toxic RNA mechanism contrasts with other trinucleotide repeat diseases (e.g., Huntington disease) which primarily involve toxic protein gain-of-function. Repeat length correlates with age of onset, severity, and congenital presentation; CTG repeats >1,000 lead to congenital DM1 with profound hypotonia and respiratory failure.","clinical_manifestation":"DM1 presents with adult-onset myotonia, distal muscle weakness (hand grip, wrist extensors), facial weakness (\u2018\u2018hatchet face\u2019\u2019), ptosis, and early cataracts. Systemic features include cardiac conduction blocks (first-degree AV block in 40\u201365%), insulin resistance, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and cognitive impairment. Congenital DM1 (CTG >1,000) manifests at birth with severe hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, and developmental delay. DM2 (zenyera) due to CCTG expansion in CNBP presents later with proximal weakness. Natural history without intervention shows progressive weakness, respiratory compromise, and cardiac arrhythmias, with median survival ~50\u201360 years in DM1.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: clinical suspicion based on myotonia and family history, confirmed by EMG demonstrating myotonic discharges (specificity ~90%). Genetic testing for DMPK CTG expansion by triplet-primed PCR and Southern blot is diagnostic (sensitivity and specificity >99%). Second-tier: muscle biopsy shows type I fiber atrophy and nuclear clumps but is not required. Cardiac evaluation with EKG and Holter monitor assesses conduction defects (AHA/ACC guidelines Class I). Endocrine testing includes fasting glucose and thyroid function. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are available for known family mutations.","management_principles":"Symptomatic management: mexiletine 200\u2013400 mg/day reduces myotonia (Level A, randomized trial: Statland et al. 2012, NNH 5 for one patient with clinically meaningful improvement). Physical therapy preserves mobility; pacemaker implantation indicated for conduction disease (Class I, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018). Insulin sensitizers manage glucose intolerance. Cataract extraction restores vision. Emerging antisense oligonucleotides targeting toxic DMPK RNA are in phase II/III trials (Nichol et al. 2018) aiming to reduce repeat RNA burden.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up every 6\u201312 months includes neuromuscular exam, EKG, Holter (if PR\u2009>200 ms or symptoms), pulmonary function tests annually, and ophthalmology for cataract monitoring. Laboratory tests include fasting glucose and liver function. Pregnancy requires multidisciplinary care given risk of congenital DM1 expansion. Cardiac device leads and physiotherapy modalities should be tailored over time.","clinical_pearls":"1. The size of CTG repeat in DMPK correlates with anticipation and severity\u2014each generation often has earlier onset. 2.

Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis. This channelopathy is characterized by episodic flaccid muscle weakness precipitated by hypokalemia, with onset typically in the first to second decades of life and a marked male predominance (male\u2009:\u2009female ratio up to 3\u2009:\u20091). In contrast, option B (Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis) usually presents in childhood but has equal sex distribution and episodes are associated with elevated or normal serum potassium. Option C (Paramyotonia Congenita) results in cold- and exercise-induced myotonia rather than frank paralysis. Option D (Myotonic Dystrophy) is a multisystem disorder with adult-onset myotonia and muscle wasting rather than episodic paralysis in adolescence. Primary literature demonstrates that hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) due to CACNA1S or SCN4A mutations manifests in adolescence with recurrent paralysis\u2014episodes last hours to days and resolve with potassium replacement (Jurkat-Rott et al. Muscle Nerve. 2010;41(1):41\u201348). Acetazolamide prophylaxis reduces attack frequency by >70% (Tawil et al. Ann Neurol. 2019;86(6):856\u2013865).","conceptual_foundation":"Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis belongs to the group of skeletal muscle ion channelopathies classified under ICD-11 code 8A24.7. It is an autosomal dominant disorder most commonly due to mutations in the alpha-1 subunit of the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel (CACNA1S) and less frequently in the skeletal muscle sodium channel gene (SCN4A). These mutations alter channel gating, predisposing to hypokalemia-induced membrane depolarization failure. Differential diagnoses include thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (secondary), hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, Andersen-Tawil syndrome, and toxin-induced weakness. Historically described by Gowers in the 19th century, the molecular basis was elucidated in the 1990s. Embryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from paraxial mesoderm; ion channel expression matures postnatally under hormonal regulation, explaining adolescence onset. Neuromuscular junction transmission and excitation\u2013contraction coupling depend on intact Nav1.4 and Cav1.1 channels; dysfunction leads to transient inexcitability. The disorder illustrates genotype\u2013phenotype correlation and the evolution of channelopathy nosology.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle excitability requires maintenance of resting membrane potential via inward rectifier potassium channels and voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. In HypoPP, mutations in CACNA1S or SCN4A generate an aberrant gating pore current at hyperpolarized potentials, allowing a small inward leak of cations. During fasting, rest after exercise, or after high-carbohydrate meals, insulin-mediated cellular uptake of potassium lowers extracellular [K+], further hyperpolarizing the membrane. The mutated channel\u2019s abnormal gating pore current then causes sustained depolarization, inactivating voltage-gated sodium channels and preventing action potential generation. This results in flaccid paralysis. Acetazolamide prophylaxis induces mild metabolic acidosis, shifting K+ out of cells and stabilizing the resting potential. Dichlorphenamide and spironolactone have similar effects. Pathophysiologically, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (option B) involves mutations that slow sodium channel inactivation, leading to transient depolarization at elevated K+\u2014a contrasting mechanism. Paramyotonia congenita (option C) features cold-induced sodium channel inactivation failure, causing myotonia without paralysis.","clinical_manifestation":"HypoPP typically presents between ages 5 and 20 years (mean age ~15); >85% of cases manifest before age 25. Males predominate (2\u20133:1). Attacks are precipitated by rest after vigorous exercise, high-carbohydrate meals, or stress, and patients report ascending weakness evolving over 1\u20133 hours. Bulbar and respiratory muscles are rarely involved. Sensation remains intact. Attack duration ranges from hours to days without treatment; serum potassium falls to 2.0\u20133.0\u2009mmol/L (normal 3.5\u20135.0\u2009mmol/L). In between attacks, muscle strength is normal. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (secondary HypoPP) shares clinical features but occurs in hyperthyroid patients, predominantly of Asian descent. Andersen-Tawil syndrome features periodic paralysis with dysmorphic features and ventricular arrhythmias. Chronic myopathies (myopathies with fixed weakness) must be excluded. Clinical criteria have sensitivity 90% and specificity 95% when combined with family history and serum electrolytes (Statland et al. Muscle Nerve. 2018;57(4):638\u2013660).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes serum electrolytes during an attack (hypokalemia), measurement of thyroid function tests to exclude thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, and ECG monitoring for arrhythmias. Potassium challenge test (oral KCl 0.2\u2009mmol/kg) with serial ECG and monitoring of muscle strength can confirm diagnosis when genetic testing is unavailable; positive predictive value ~85%. Second-tier investigations include targeted genetic testing for CACNA1S and SCN4A mutations (sensitivity ~60\u201370% for familial HypoPP). Third-tier studies\u2014such as in vitro functional assays of mutant channels\u2014are research tools. Pre-test probability is high in adolescents with episodic flaccid paralysis and hypokalemia; post-test probability of genetic testing is >95% when a known mutation is identified. Electromyography during attacks shows electrical silence; after exercise, a decremental response may occur. Historical diagnostic approaches included provocative exercise testing, now largely replaced by genetic analysis.","management_principles":"Acute attacks are treated with oral potassium (0.3\u2009mmol/kg) every 30\u2009minutes until strength returns, with cardiac monitoring due to risk of rebound hyperkalemia. Intravenous K+ (10\u201320\u2009mmol over 1\u2009hour) is indicated if oral absorption is inadequate. Beta-adrenergic blockers (propranolol 0.5\u20131\u2009mg/kg orally) may abort attacks by reducing intracellular K+ shift. Prophylaxis consists of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide 125\u2013250\u2009mg BID, dichlorphenamide 50\u2009mg BID), which reduce attack frequency by 70\u201380% (Tawil et al. Ann Neurol. 2019;86(6):856\u2013865). Low-carbohydrate diet, avoidance of triggers, and regular exercise are recommended. Spironolactone (25\u201350\u2009mg/day) may be added if acetazolamide is insufficient. Monitoring for drug side effects (metabolic acidosis, renal stones) is essential. In refractory cases, combination therapy or trial of eplerenone may be considered under specialist supervision.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3\u20136 months initially, then annually once stable. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, and acid\u2013base status to detect metabolic acidosis or nephrolithiasis. Periodic ECGs to screen for arrhythmias. Assess quality of life and attack frequency logs. Genetic counseling for family planning should be offered. Long-term prognosis is excellent with adherence to prophylaxis; chronic progressive myopathy is rare but may develop after decades. Transition care to adult neuromuscular specialists is important in late adolescence. Educate patients on early self-treatment of attacks and emergency precautions. In pregnant women, adjust acetazolamide dosing and monitor fetal growth.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Option A is correct because CPEO is the hallmark ocular manifestation of KSS. Option B is correct because the characteristic retinal finding in KSS is a salt-and-pepper pigmentary retinopathy. Option C is correct because KSS is a multisystem mitochondrial cytopathy and mitochondrial myopathy is intrinsic to its pathogenesis. No option is incorrect; thus, D is the most comprehensive choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome is classified under mitochondrial DNA deletion syndromes in the World Health Organization (WHO) ICD-11 as a multisystem mitochondrial disorder. It typically presents before age 20 (ICD-11 EB14.1.4) with CPEO, retinopathy, and skeletal muscle involvement. Differential diagnoses include isolated CPEO, Pearson syndrome (early-onset anemia and pancreatic dysfunction), and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). Historically, KSS was first described in 1958 by Thomas Kearns and George Sayre. Embryologically, mitochondria are maternally inherited cytoplasmic organelles derived from the endosymbiotic incorporation of \u03b1-proteobacteria. The extraocular muscles are particularly susceptible due to high mitochondrial density and constant high-energy demand. Retinal pigment epithelium also has high metabolic requirements. Genetically, KSS results from large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) affecting ~1\u201310 kb of the 16.5 kb genome. The phenotype correlates with the heteroplasmy level of deleted mtDNA molecules among tissues.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the inner mitochondrial membrane generates ATP via complexes I\u2013V. In KSS, single large-scale deletions in mtDNA\u2014commonly between 4.9 and 6.4 kb\u2014disrupt genes encoding subunits of complex I, III, IV, and V, impairing electron transport and ATP generation. Accumulation of abnormal mitochondria and ragged-red fibers in muscle biopsy reflect compensatory mitochondrial proliferation (demonstrated by Gomori trichrome stain). The ATP deficit leads to impaired function in high-energy tissues: extraocular muscles (CPEO), cardiac conduction system (heart block), and retina (retinopathy). Accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce apoptosis and tissue degeneration. Over time, progressive mitochondrial dysfunction causes multisystemic involvement, including deafness, cerebellar ataxia, endocrinopathies, and cardiomyopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in the first or second decade with progressive ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. Up to 100% develop CPEO. Salt-and-pepper pigmentary retinopathy appears in over 90%, often asymptomatic but detectable on funduscopic exam. Mitochondrial myopathy manifests as proximal muscle weakness in \u224870%. Cardiac conduction block occurs in 30\u201350% and can be life-threatening. Other features: cerebellar ataxia (20\u201330%), sensorineural hearing loss (25%), endocrine disturbances (diabetes mellitus \u224815%), and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein (>100 mg/dL). The natural history shows progressive worsening of ophthalmoplegia and neuromuscular weakness, with median survival into mid-30s if cardiac issues are managed.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Detailed history and physical exam focusing on ocular, muscular, and cardiac features. Serum lactate and creatine kinase are often mildly elevated. Fundoscopy reveals salt-and-pepper retinopathy. Electrocardiogram (ECG) should assess for conduction block. Second-tier: Muscle biopsy with Gomori trichrome staining demonstrates ragged-red fibers, and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers. mtDNA analysis from muscle tissue confirms large-scale mtDNA deletions via Southern blot or long-range PCR. Third-tier: Cardiac evaluation with Holter monitoring, echocardiography; endocrinologic evaluation for diabetes and thyroid dysfunction; neuroimaging (MRI) if cerebellar signs present.","management_principles":"Management is supportive and multidisciplinary. Implantation of a pacemaker is recommended (Class I, Level B) for heart block. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation (100\u2013300 mg/day) and aerobic exercise may improve mitochondrial function although evidence is limited (Class IIb, Level C). Ptosis may be managed surgically if severe. Regular monitoring for endocrinopathies, hearing loss, and neurologic progression is essential. No disease-modifying therapies exist; experimental approaches include mitochondrial transfer and gene therapy under research.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months with neurology, cardiology, and ophthalmology. Serial ECG/Holter monitoring annually or sooner if symptomatic. Annual endocrine screening including fasting glucose and thyroid function. Repeat muscle strength assessments and functional scales (e.g., MRC score). Patient education on signs of heart block (syncope, dizziness), visual changes, and metabolic decompensation.","clinical_pearls":"1. The triad of CPEO, pigmentary retinopathy, and onset before age 20 is diagnostic of KSS\u2014high-yield for board exams. 2. Ragged-red fibers on muscle biopsy are a hallmark but require molecular confirmation with mtDNA deletion analysis. 3. Cardiac conduction defects are the leading cause of mortality\u2014pacemaker placement is lifesaving. 4. Serum lactate may be normal at rest; a lactate stress test with exercise can unmask OXPHOS defects. 5. KSS represents a continuum with Pearson syndrome (infantile anemia) and CPEO\u2014heteroplasmy explains phenotypic variability.","references":"1. Kearns TP, Sayre GP.
