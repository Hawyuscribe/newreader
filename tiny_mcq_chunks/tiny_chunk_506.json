Dx?","options":["PRES.","RCVS.","CVT.","CNS vasculitis."],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"RCVS.","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B (RCVS). Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome presents with recurrent thunderclap headaches, angiographic \u201cstring-of-pearls\u201d appearance due to segmental vasoconstriction, and normal inflammatory markers. PRES (A) typically shows posterior leukoencephalopathy on MRI. CVT (C) would demonstrate venous sinus thrombosis on MRV. Primary CNS vasculitis (D) leads to insidious symptoms, elevated ESR/CRP, and vessel wall enhancement.","conceptual_foundation":"RCVS is classified under ICHD-3 as 6.7.3; it features sudden severe headaches over days to weeks. Pathophysiologically, transient dysregulation of cerebral arterial tone leads to segmental vasoconstriction. Differential includes SAH, cervical artery dissection, and primary angiitis of the CNS. Angiographic changes are reversible within 12 weeks.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral autoregulation maintains constant CBF via myogenic and neurogenic mechanisms. In RCVS, endothelial dysfunction and sympathetic overactivity cause transient arterial narrowing. Triggers include vasoactive substances (e.g., SSRIs, triptans), postpartum state, or illicit drugs (cocaine). Vasoconstriction peaks around 1\u20132 weeks and resolves by 3 months.","clinical_manifestation":"Presentation: recurrent thunderclap headaches reaching peak intensity within seconds, often provoked by exertion, sexual activity, or Valsalva. Neurological exam is typically normal. Focal deficits or seizures may occur if complications (ischemia, hemorrhage) arise. Recurrence over 1\u20134 weeks is common.","diagnostic_approach":"Workup entails noncontrast CT to exclude SAH, MRI/MRA to rule out alternative diagnoses, and digital subtraction angiography showing multifocal arterial narrowing. CSF is normal or near-normal, helping differentiate from vasculitis. Diagnosis confirmed by resolution of vasoconstriction on follow-up angiography at 3 months.","management_principles":"Supportive care and removal of triggers. Nimodipine or other calcium channel blockers may alleviate headache and promote vasodilation. Analgesics (acetaminophen) are preferred; triptans and ergots are contraindicated. Blood pressure control and monitoring for complications (stroke, hemorrhage) are imperative.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat vascular imaging at 6\u201312 weeks to document reversal of vasoconstriction. Monitor for new neurological symptoms. Long-term prognosis is favorable; most patients recover without permanent deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1. Thunderclap headache with normal CT mandates workup for RCVS. 2. CSF is typically normal, distinguishing from vasculitis. 3. Calcium channel blockers provide symptomatic relief. 4. Avoid vasoactive drugs. 5. Angiographic changes reverse within 3 months.","references":"1. Ducros A. Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome.

Horizontal spontaneous nystagmus at primary gaze that is low in amplitude and fast-beating to one side is characteristic of a central vestibular lesion affecting the vestibular nuclei in the medulla. Peripheral vestibular nystagmus (e.g., lesions at the pontocerebellar angle) typically presents with high-amplitude, low-frequency nystagmus inhibited by fixation, which is not the case here. Central lesions such as those in the brainstem often produce low-amplitude, high-frequency nystagmus that persists under fixation. Option A (Tectal midbrain) is more often associated with vertical or torsional nystagmus (e.g., upbeat or downbeat), not pure horizontal. Option B (Cerebellar hemisphere) lesions produce gaze-evoked nystagmus on lateral gaze and rebound nystagmus rather than spontaneous primary gaze nystagmus. Option C (Pontocerebellar angle) involves the vestibular nerve and produces peripheral vestibular nystagmus of higher amplitude, which is suppressed by fixation\u2014features inconsistent with this presentation.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding nystagmus requires knowledge of ocular motor control and vestibular anatomy. Nystagmus comprises a slow phase (driven by vestibular or pursuit systems) and a fast phase (resetting saccade). Lesions of central vestibular structures (vestibular nuclei in the medulla) result in spontaneous horizontal nystagmus at primary gaze with low amplitude because the lesion disrupts the central integrator (nucleus prepositus hypoglossi) and the vestibular nuclei without peripheral hair cell involvement. In contrast, lesions of the pontocerebellar angle affect the vestibular nerve peripherally, producing high-amplitude, low-frequency nystagmus. Cerebellar hemisphere lesions (flocculus or fastigial nucleus) impair gaze-holding mechanisms and lead to gaze-evoked or rebound nystagmus, not spontaneous primary gaze nystagmus.","pathophysiology":"Normal horizontal gaze holding is mediated by the neural integrator located in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and medial vestibular nucleus in the medulla. A focal lesion of the vestibular nuclei disrupts the tonic firing that normally counterbalances vestibular asymmetry, creating an unopposed drift of the eyes toward the lesioned side (slow phase) and corrective fast saccades toward the intact side. The resulting low-amplitude, high-frequency horizontal nystagmus persists at primary gaze and is not suppressed by fixation due to the central lesion.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with medullary vestibular nucleus lesions present with spontaneous horizontal nystagmus at rest, often accompanied by vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and postural instability. They may also exhibit other brainstem signs such as dysphagia, dysphonia, or sensory deficits in the ipsilateral face and contralateral body if the lesion extends. By contrast, pontocerebellar angle lesions typically present with hearing loss and tinnitus in addition to peripheral vestibular signs.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes a bedside ocular motility examination and head impulse test. Central nystagmus is not suppressed by fixation and is present at primary gaze, guiding imaging to the brainstem. MRI of the brainstem with diffusion-weighted sequences is the modality of choice to identify medullary infarcts or demyelinating lesions. Audiometry and vestibular function tests (caloric testing, vHIT) help distinguish central from peripheral etiologies.","management_principles":"Treatment of a medullary vestibular nucleus lesion depends on etiology. For ischemic infarction, acute management follows AHA/ASA stroke guidelines with consideration of thrombolysis or thrombectomy if in window. Antiplatelet therapy and risk factor modification are instituted for secondary prevention. For inflammatory lesions (e.g., demyelination), high-dose corticosteroids or disease-modifying therapies are used. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy helps promote central compensation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require longitudinal follow-up for neurologic and vestibular recovery. Serial MRI may be indicated to monitor lesion evolution. Vestibular function reassessment and continued rehabilitation optimize balance and gait. Secondary stroke prevention measures (blood pressure, lipids, diabetes) should be monitored every 3\u20136 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Central vestibular nystagmus is low amplitude, high frequency, and not suppressed by fixation. 2. Peripheral vestibular nystagmus is high amplitude, low frequency, and inhibited by fixation. 3. Spontaneous primary gaze horizontal nystagmus localizes to vestibular nuclei (medulla). 4. Vertical or torsional nystagmus suggests midbrain or cerebellar nodulus involvement. 5. Persistent central nystagmus mandates neuroimaging to rule out stroke or demyelination.","references":"1. Leigh RJ, Zee DS. The Neurology of Eye Movements. 5th ed. Oxford University Press; 2015. 2.
