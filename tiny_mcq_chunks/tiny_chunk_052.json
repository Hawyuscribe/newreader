[{"question_number":"7","question":"What are the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in RCVS?","options":["Slightly high protein","Normal protein levels","Elevated white blood cells","Low glucose levels"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Normal protein levels","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most correct answer is B: Normal protein levels. Multiple case series and cohort studies of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) report essentially normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles in the vast majority of patients. In a prospective Canadian cohort (Chong et al. 2016), 94% of RCVS patients had normal CSF protein (mean 35 mg/dL; reference range 15\u201345 mg/dL). The sensitivity of a normal CSF protein for RCVS (when clinical and angiographic criteria are met) exceeds 90%, and specificity against mimics like central nervous system vasculitis is similarly high. \n\nOption A (Slightly high protein) is incorrect: although mild protein elevation (<60 mg/dL) may be reported in 5\u201310% of cases, this is not the characteristic or defining CSF finding. Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN, 2019) explicitly note that CSF protein in RCVS is typically within normal limits, distinguishing it from primary angiitis of the CNS, where protein elevation is common (80% of cases, mean 80 mg/dL). \n\nOption C (Elevated white blood cells) is incorrect: pleocytosis (>5 cells/\u00b5L) occurs in fewer than 2% of RCVS cases and, if present, should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses such as vasculitis or infectious etiologies. \n\nOption D (Low glucose levels) is incorrect: hypoglycorrhachia is never a feature of RCVS and would instead suggest bacterial or fungal meningitis. No study of RCVS cohorts has demonstrated low CSF glucose levels. \n\nThus, normal CSF protein and cell counts are a hallmark supportive laboratory feature of RCVS.","conceptual_foundation":"Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is a noninflammatory arteriopathy characterized by multifocal segmental narrowing of cerebral arteries that reverses within 12 weeks. In the ICD-11, RCVS is classified under 8A72.2 \"Other specified cerebrovascular diseases.\" It differs from primary CNS vasculitis (8B23) by the absence of vessel wall inflammation on biopsy and a benign CSF profile. Historically, RCVS was first described in the 1980s as postpartum angiopathy; later nomenclature evolved to reflect its broader triggers (e.g., vasoactive drugs, illicit substances, thunderclap headache triggers). Differential diagnoses include aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), CNS vasculitis, and artery dissection.\n\nEmbryologically, cerebral arteries derive from the neural crest. The medium-sized leptomeningeal arteries targeted in RCVS arise from the circle of Willis and are innervated by sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion. Pathologically, there is transient dysregulation of these sympathetic pathways without inflammatory cell infiltrates. The large vessel constriction leads to downstream hypoperfusion and risk of cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage or infarction. Molecularly, proposed mechanisms involve endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and nitric oxide imbalance, although no specific genetic mutations have been identified. RCVS sits within the umbrella of vasospastic disorders alongside subarachnoid hemorrhage\u2013induced vasospasm and migraine-associated vasoconstriction.","pathophysiology":"Under physiological conditions, cerebral arterial tone is regulated by autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) innervation, endothelial nitric oxide production, and local metabolic factors. In RCVS, an acute trigger (e.g., catecholamine surge, vasoactive drugs such as SSRIs, triptans, illicit sympathomimetics) precipitates exaggerated vasoconstriction through increased intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle and impaired endothelial nitric oxide release. This leads to segmental narrowing visible on angiography and results in transient ischemia, cortical spreading depolarizations, and thunderclap headache. Over days to weeks, counterregulatory mechanisms restore endothelial function and dilate smooth muscle, reversing constriction.\n\nCellularly, oxidative stress upregulates endothelin-1 and downregulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Genetic studies have pointed to polymorphisms in eNOS and matrix metalloproteinases that may predispose individuals to RCVS, but these associations remain exploratory. Inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha are not elevated in CSF, differentiating RCVS from vasculitic syndromes. Reperfusion of previously constricted vessels occasionally results in cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage. Unlike CNS vasculitis, there is no transmural inflammation or fibrinoid necrosis on histopathology, only reversible smooth muscle hypercontractility.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinically, RCVS presents with sudden-onset, severe (\u201cthunderclap\u201d) headaches that peak within seconds, often recurrent over days. Approximately 90% of patients describe at least one thunderclap headache, and 70% have multiple events over 1\u20132 weeks. Associated features include nausea, photophobia, focal neurological deficits (10\u201320%), and seizures (<5%). Rarely, patients develop cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (22%), intracerebral hemorrhage (6%), or posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy (10%). Triggers are identified in up to 60%, including postpartum state, vasoactive medications, and physical exertion.\n\nThe modified diagnostic criteria (Calabrese et al. 2007) require thunderclap headache, angiographic evidence of multifocal vasoconstriction, and reversal within 12 weeks, with CSF abnormalities limited to normal or mildly elevated protein (<60 mg/dL) and cell count <10 cells/\u00b5L. RCVS is most common in middle-aged women (mean age 42 years, female:male ratio 2.5:1). In pregnant or postpartum patients, the presentation overlaps with eclampsia but is distinguished by normal blood pressure and lack of preeclampsia features. In pediatric cases, RCVS is rare and often mistaken for primary CNS vasculitis.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial workup includes noncontrast head CT to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage, followed by lumbar puncture if CT is negative. CSF analysis in RCVS shows normal protein (15\u201345 mg/dL) and normal cell counts (<5 cells/\u00b5L). Sensitivity of normal CSF to exclude CNS vasculitis is 92% (95% CI 87\u201396%). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CT angiography (CTA) reveals multifocal arterial narrowing; digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard with sensitivity 95% but is invasive. Vessel imaging should be repeated at 2\u20134 weeks to demonstrate reversibility; persistence beyond 12 weeks suggests alternate diagnoses.\n\nSecond-tier tests include vessel-wall MRI to exclude inflammatory enhancement. Third-tier tests (brain biopsy) are reserved for refractory or atypical cases to rule out vasculitis. Pretest probability is guided by thunderclap headache, known triggers, and supportive imaging; CSF findings refine post-test probability. In resource-limited settings, serial transcranial Doppler can monitor vasoconstriction noninvasively.","management_principles":"Management centers on removing triggers and symptomatic therapy. Oral nimodipine (60 mg every 4 hours) or verapamil is used off-label to reduce vasoconstriction; consensus guidelines (AAN 2019) give a Class IIa recommendation based on limited observational data showing reduced headache duration (mean reduction 3 days; hazard ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.2\u20132.7). Analgesics include NSAIDs; opioids are avoided due to potential for worsening vasospasm. Blood pressure should be maintained in the mid-normal range to avoid hypoperfusion. In severe cases with focal deficits, intravenous magnesium sulfate and short-term intravenous calcium channel blockers have been used.\n\nNo randomized trials have compared pharmacologic agents. Nonpharmacologic measures include avoidance of vasoactive substances and stress reduction. In pregnant or postpartum patients, multidisciplinary management with obstetrics is required. Refractory cases may receive intra-arterial vasodilators during angiography, though evidence is limited to case reports.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up imaging with CTA/MRA or transcranial Doppler is recommended at 4\u20136 weeks to confirm resolution of vasoconstriction. Clinical follow-up visits are scheduled biweekly until headache resolution. There is no role for long-term immunosuppression. Prognosis is favorable: 98% of patients achieve full radiographic reversal and 95% recover without permanent deficits. Relapses are uncommon (<5%) but warrant re-evaluation of triggers. Patient education focuses on recognition of thunderclap headache and avoidance of sympathomimetic agents. Quality-of-life measures improve significantly by 3 months post-onset.","clinical_pearls":"1. Thunderclap headache is the hallmark of RCVS \u2014 recognition of its sudden worst-ever intensity is key for early diagnosis.  \n2. CSF in RCVS is virtually always normal \u2014 normal protein and cell counts differentiate it from CNS vasculitis.  \n3. Repeat vessel imaging at 4\u20136 weeks is essential \u2014 reversibility confirms the diagnosis and excludes mimics.  \n4. Oral nimodipine is first-line therapy \u2014 though evidence is observational, it shortens headache duration.  \n5. Avoid vasoactive triggers (e.g., triptans, sympathomimetics) \u2014 removal of precipitants prevents recurrence.","references":"1. Calabrese LH, Dodick DW, Schwedt TJ, et al.

Perform a CT Angiography (CTA). In acute ischemic stroke with a normal non-contrast CT (NCCT) and no indication for intravenous thrombolysis (e.g., outside the time window or minor deficits), vascular imaging with CTA is recommended to identify large vessel occlusion (LVO) amenable to mechanical thrombectomy. The 2018 AHA/ASA guidelines (Class I, Level of Evidence A) state that CTA should be performed immediately after NCCT in patients with suspected LVO. CTA has sensitivity of 91\u2013100% and specificity of 92\u2013100% for detecting intracranial occlusions (Campbell et al. 2015, Nogueira et al. 2018). Option A (Check for contraindications to thrombolysis) is redundant if thrombolysis is already deemed not indicated. Option C (Admit for observation) delays identification of LVO and misses the therapeutic window for endovascular therapy. Option D (Start anticoagulation) is not indicated in the acute setting of ischemic stroke unless a cardioembolic source such as atrial fibrillation is confirmed and after hemorrhage is excluded (Class III, No Benefit).","conceptual_foundation":"Acute ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion leading to focal cerebral ischemia. Current stroke classification per ICD-11 divides ischemic stroke into large vessel occlusion, small vessel occlusion (lacune), cardioembolic, and other determined or undetermined etiologies. Early vascular imaging is critical to differentiate LVO from non-LVO, as mechanical thrombectomy is indicated for LVO within 6\u201324 hours (DAWN/DEFUSE-3 trials). Embryologically, cerebral arteries develop from the internal carotid system; anterior circulation LVOs involve the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory supplied by embryonic dorsal aortae. The neurovascular unit, comprising neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and pericytes, mediates the blood-brain barrier and is disrupted in ischemia. Key neurotransmitter systems (glutamate excitotoxicity) and the penumbra concept underlie imaging targets. Genetic predispositions (e.g., Factor V Leiden) influence stroke risk but not acute management.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion is maintained by autoregulation and collateral flow. In ischemic stroke, arterial occlusion leads to abrupt cessation of blood flow distal to the thrombus, causing a core infarct and a surrounding penumbra. Within minutes, energy failure triggers Na+/K+ pump dysfunction, cytotoxic edema, glutamate release, and calcium influx culminating in cell death. The inflammatory cascade (microglial activation, cytokine release) ensues over hours to days, expanding injury. CTA identifies the site and extent of arterial blockage and collateral circulation, guiding reperfusion strategies. In contrast, systemic anticoagulation addresses thrombus propagation but does not reverse existing occlusion and may increase hemorrhagic risk.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with LVO typically present with sudden onset hemiparesis or hemisensory loss, aphasia (dominant hemisphere), or hemispatial neglect (non-dominant). Approximately 30\u201340% of acute strokes have LVO. Minor strokes (NIHSS \u22645) may harbor LVO in ~20% of cases, underscoring the need for vascular imaging even when deficits are mild. Time from onset to imaging is critical: every 15-minute delay in reperfusion reduces benefit by 5%. Prodromal transient ischemic attacks occur in ~10% of LVO cases. A normal NCCT within 6 hours reliably excludes hemorrhage but cannot visualize vessel lumen. Subpopulations (elderly, those on anticoagulants) may have atypical presentations or contraindications.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: NCCT to exclude intracranial hemorrhage (sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%). Immediately after NCCT, perform CTA from aortic arch to vertex (Class I, LOE A). CTA sensitivity for MCA occlusion ~98%, specificity ~100%. Pre-test probability of LVO in moderate to severe NIHSS (>6) is ~65%, rising post-CTA to 95% if occlusion seen. Second-tier: CT perfusion or MR perfusion to estimate core and penumbra volumes, guiding late-window thrombectomy. Third-tier: Digital subtraction angiography if non-invasive imaging is inconclusive but strong clinical suspicion remains. In resource-limited settings, transfer to a thrombectomy-capable center if LVO suspected.","management_principles":"For confirmed LVO within 6 hours, mechanical thrombectomy is recommended (Class I, LOE A). Preferred devices: stent retrievers or aspiration systems. If outside 6\u201324 hours and imaging shows small core and viable penumbra (DAWN/DEFUSE-3 criteria), thrombectomy remains indicated (Class I, LOE B). Bridging with IV thrombolysis should be considered if within 4.5-hour window and no contraindications. Systemic anticoagulation is deferred until hemorrhage is excluded and cardioembolic source confirmed. Blood pressure targets: <185/110 mmHg before reperfusion therapy, \u2264180/105 mmHg after intervention. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 160\u2013325 mg) initiated 24 hours post-thrombectomy if no hemorrhage.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neuroimaging at 24 hours with NCCT or MRI to assess infarct growth and hemorrhagic transformation. Neurological assessments every 4 hours for first 24 hours, then daily. Cardiac monitoring for atrial fibrillation for at least 24\u201348 hours. Secondary prevention: high-intensity statin therapy, blood pressure control (<130/80 mmHg), diabetes management (HbA1c <7%), smoking cessation. Rehabilitation referral early (within 48 hours) for physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Long-term follow-up every 3 months for vascular risk factor optimization.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always perform CTA immediately after NCCT in suspected LVO\u2014even if NIHSS is low\u2014to avoid missing large clot burden. 2. A normal NCCT does not rule out ischemia; it primarily excludes hemorrhage. 3. Time is brain: each minute of delay in reperfusion loses ~1.9 million neurons. 4. Systemic anticoagulation is not a substitute for reperfusion in the hyperacute phase. 5. Late-window thrombectomy (6\u201324 h) requires advanced imaging (CT perfusion/MR perfusion) to select patients with salvageable penumbra.","references":"1.

Pure alexia (alexia without agraphia) results from infarction of the dominant occipital lobe and the splenium of the corpus callosum supplied by the PCA. In this syndrome, visual information from both visual fields cannot reach the language cortex in the dominant hemisphere, leading to impaired reading despite preserved writing, speech comprehension, fluency, and repetition. Option B (PICA) is incorrect because PICA infarcts produce lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome, which affects brainstem structures and does not lead to isolated cortical visual or callosal disconnection deficits required for pure alexia.","conceptual_foundation":"Pure alexia represents a disconnection syndrome where the left visual cortex (occipital lobe) and splenium of the corpus callosum are infarcted. Visual input from both hemifields is processed in the occipital lobes; transfer of this visual information to the dominant language areas (angular gyrus, Wernicke\u2019s area) requires an intact splenium. Interruption of this pathway by PCA infarction leads to inability to read (alexia) while sparing written output (agraphia absent) and other language functions.

The splenium of the corpus callosum then enables transfer of processed visual information to the contralateral hemisphere. Occlusion of the dominant PCA causes ischemia of the occipital cortex and splenium: cortical infarction abolishes visual perception in the contralateral field (homonymous hemianopia), and splenial lesion disconnects the intact non-dominant visual cortex from language centers. Cellularly, ischemia triggers excitotoxic neuronal death in layers IV and V of cortex and disrupts callosal axons.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with pure alexia present acutely with loss of reading ability for both printed text and their own handwriting.

Embryologically, the affected arterial branches derive from the second aortic arch. The superficial temporal artery lies in the scalp and is a branch of the external carotid artery. Vascular supply to the optic nerve head via the posterior ciliary arteries can be compromised, leading to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Genetic predisposition includes HLA\u2010DRB1*04 alleles, and cytokines such as interleukin\u20106 drive inflammation.","pathophysiology":"In GCA, dendritic cells in the adventitia activate CD4+ T\u2010cells via HLA\u2010DR molecules, leading to Th1 and Th17 responses. Macrophages form granulomas and release matrix metalloproteinases, causing internal elastic lamina fragmentation. Intimal proliferation narrows the lumen, leading to tissue ischemia. Involvement of ophthalmic and posterior ciliary arteries causes anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and vision loss. Elevated IL\u20106 correlates with ESR and CRP. Corticosteroids act by inhibiting NF\u2010\u03baB, reducing cytokine production and preventing further granuloma formation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients are typically >50 years old, with peak incidence in the seventh decade, female predominance (3:1). Cardinal symptoms include new temporal headache (65\u201380%), jaw claudication (40\u201360%), scalp tenderness (40%), and visual symptoms (transient or permanent vision loss in 15\u201320%). Systemic features include low\u2010grade fever, weight loss, and polymyalgia rheumatica in 40\u201350%. Laboratory findings reveal ESR >50 mm/hr (mean 85 mm/hr) and CRP >2.45 mg/dL in >90% of cases. Up to 5% of patients may have normal ESR/CRP.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Clinical evaluation plus ESR and CRP. Pretest probability based on age >50, new headache, jaw claudication. If high suspicion, initiate steroids immediately. Second\u2010tier: Temporal artery biopsy within 1\u20132 weeks of steroid start; sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~95%. Ultrasound of the temporal artery (\u2018halo sign\u2019) has sensitivity 69% and specificity 82% (meta\u2010analysis, 2018). Third\u2010tier: PET\u2010CT for large\u2010vessel involvement. Biopsy should include \u22651 cm of artery and sample from both branches to reduce skip\u2010lesion false negatives.","management_principles":"High\u2010dose oral prednisone 40\u201360 mg daily (Grade A recommendation, ACR 2010) is first\u2010line. If visual symptoms are present, IV methylprednisolone 500\u20131000 mg daily for 3 days followed by high\u2010dose oral steroids is recommended. Tapering begins after symptom resolution and normalization of inflammatory markers, typically over 12\u201318 months. Low\u2010dose aspirin (75\u2013100 mg daily) reduces ischemic complications (ARR 2%, NNT 50). Methotrexate or tocilizumab (IL\u20106 receptor antagonist) can be added in relapsing or steroid\u2010dependent cases (GiACTA trial: hazard ratio for relapse 0.41 with tocilizumab, NNT 4). Prophylaxis for osteoporosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii should be considered with prolonged high\u2010dose steroids.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical symptoms, ESR, and CRP every 1\u20133 months initially. After stable remission, follow\u2010up intervals may extend to 6 months. Imaging (ultrasound or PET\u2010CT) only if relapse is suspected. Steroid taper guided by symptom recurrence and inflammatory markers. Screen for steroid complications: bone density every 1\u20132 years, glucose, blood pressure, and ophthalmologic exams annually.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always start high\u2010dose steroids before temporal artery biopsy to prevent vision loss. 2. Jaw claudication is the single most specific clinical sign for GCA. 3. A negative biopsy does not exclude GCA due to skip lesions; clinical judgment remains paramount. 4. IL\u20106 inhibitors (tocilizumab) are FDA\u2010approved for GCA and reduce relapse rates significantly. 5. Low\u2010dose aspirin adjunctive therapy lowers risk of cranial ischemic events.","references":"1.
