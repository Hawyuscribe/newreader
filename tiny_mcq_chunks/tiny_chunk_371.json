[{"question_number":"2","question":"A 31-year-old female smoker with sensory neuropathy and motor symptoms has a chest X-ray showing a mass at the lung apex. What is the appropriate antibiotic treatment?","options":["Anti-Hu","Azithromycin","Ciprofloxacin","Doxycycline"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Anti-Hu (paraneoplastic anti-neuronal antibody associated with small cell lung carcinoma causing sensory neuronopathy)","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"1. Option Analysis":"Option A (Anti-Hu): Correct. Anti-Hu (also known as ANNA-1) is an onconeural antibody directed against neuronal nuclear antigens. Its presence in a patient with a Pancoast tumor causing sensory neuronopathy and motor involvement confirms a paraneoplastic syndrome rather than an infectious etiology. Anti-Hu antibodies target dorsal root ganglia neurons, producing subacute sensory neuropathy and motor deficits in small cell lung cancer. Option B (Azithromycin): Incorrect. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic effective against atypical respiratory pathogens (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia) but has no role in paraneoplastic neuropathy. Option C (Ciprofloxacin): Incorrect. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone with broad Gram-negative coverage, used for urinary and gastrointestinal infections; it does not address immune-mediated neuronal damage or paraneoplastic antibodies. Option D (Doxycycline): Incorrect. Doxycycline is employed in rickettsial infections, Lyme disease, and certain atypical bacteria, but it neither targets nor ameliorates paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. Only identification of Anti-Hu confirms the immune etiology; immunotherapy and oncologic treatment, not antibiotics, are indicated.","2. Conceptual Foundation":"The brachial plexus, composed of C5\u2013T1 nerve roots, innervates upper limb sensory and motor function. A Pancoast tumor at the lung apex infiltrates local structures including the inferior trunk of the brachial plexus and sympathetic chain, causing neuropathic pain, sensory loss along C8\u2013T1 dermatomes, and Horner\u2019s syndrome. Paraneoplastic neuronopathies arise when the immune system generates antibodies against shared antigens in tumor cells and neurons. Anti-Hu antibodies (ANNA-1) bind neuronal nuclear proteins, leading to dorsal root ganglia neuron death. Small cell lung carcinoma often expresses Hu antigen epitopes, prompting T-cell and antibody-mediated neuronal injury. Understanding this immune cross-reactivity is essential in neurology board review and guides differential diagnosis between direct tumor invasion versus paraneoplastic syndromes.","3. Pathophysiology":"Paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy in small cell lung cancer is mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and onconeural antibodies (Anti-Hu). Neurons and tumor cells share Hu antigens\u2014RNA-binding proteins present in neuronal nuclei. Anti-Hu binds these antigens, activating complement and facilitating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. CD8+ T cells infiltrate dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord, releasing perforin and granzyme to induce neuronal apoptosis. This results in degeneration of sensory ganglion cells and retrograde axonal degeneration. Motor fibers may be secondarily affected via inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1). Genetic predisposition (HLA-A24, HLA-B8) and tumor expression levels modulate immune response. Neurotransmitter homeostasis is disrupted by loss of neuronal terminals; excitotoxicity via glutamate receptors may contribute to further neuronal injury. Understanding these molecular pathways informs immunotherapy approaches.","4. Clinical Manifestation":"Patients typically present with subacute progressive sensory ataxia, burning paresthesia, and loss of vibration/proprioception in a stocking-glove distribution, reflecting dorsal root ganglia dysfunction. Motor symptoms\u2014weakness, muscle atrophy, hyporeflexia\u2014emerge later due to secondary involvement of ventral horn or peripheral motor axons. Pancoast tumors at the apex produce shoulder pain radiating down the arm, Horner\u2019s syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) from sympathetic chain involvement, and clavicular pain from brachial plexus infiltration. Symptom progression is rapid (weeks to months) versus chronic degenerative neuropathies. Autonomic features (orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysmotility) may occur. Prognosis correlates with tumor stage and antibody titer; high Anti-Hu levels often predict poorer neurological recovery despite oncologic remission.","5. Diagnostic Approach":"Evaluation begins with detailed neurological exam showing sensory neuronopathy signs (absent/severely reduced sensory nerve action potentials on nerve conduction studies) and EMG revealing denervation. MRI spine and brachial plexus MRI may demonstrate ganglionitis or plexus involvement. Chest imaging (X-ray, CT) identifies a lung apex mass; PET scan assesses metabolic activity. CSF analysis can show elevated protein without pleocytosis. Paraneoplastic panel confirms Anti-Hu antibody positivity via immunoblot or indirect immunofluorescence. Other differential diagnoses include CIDP, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Vitamin B12 deficiency, and toxic neuropathies; these lack paraneoplastic markers and imaging findings. Early tumor biopsy is required for histologic confirmation, guiding specific oncologic therapy.","6. Management Principles":"Primary management involves oncologic treatment of small cell lung carcinoma\u2014chemoradiation with platinum-based regimens (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV plus etoposide 100 mg/m2 days 1\u20133) and thoracic radiotherapy (45 Gy in 1.5 Gy BID fractions). Immune modulation includes high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 5 days), followed by taper, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days), and plasmapheresis (5 exchanges over 10 days) to reduce antibody levels. Rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks) may be considered for refractory cases. Monitor complete blood count, renal function, and infusion reactions. Physical and occupational therapy are essential to maintain function and prevent contractures. No antibiotic therapy is indicated in paraneoplastic neuronopathy.","7. Follow-up Guidelines":"Patients require close interdisciplinary follow-up with oncology, neurology, and rehabilitation services. Neurological exams and antibody titers are reassessed every 3 months for the first year, then biannually. Repeat imaging (CT/PET) is performed every 6 months to monitor for tumor recurrence. Monitor for long-term steroid or chemotherapy complications: osteoporosis (DEXA scan annually), secondary infections, cisplatin-induced neuropathy. Physical therapy assessments track motor recovery; orthotic support may be adjusted. Educate patients on symptom recognition (new pain, weakness) and prompt reporting. Psychological support and palliative care consultations should be offered as needed.","8. Clinical Pearls":"\u2022 Anti-Hu antibody is highly specific (>95%) for paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy in small cell lung carcinoma.  \n\u2022 Pancoast tumors often present with shoulder pain, Horner\u2019s syndrome, and brachial plexopathy.  \n\u2022 Differentiate paraneoplastic neuronopathy from CIDP by rapid progression, absent CSF pleocytosis, and positive onconeural antibodies.  \n\u2022 Early tumor treatment combined with immunotherapy yields better neurological outcomes.  \n\u2022 Avoid unnecessary antibiotics; paraneoplastic syndromes are immune, not infectious.  \n\u2022 UpToDate (2023) emphasizes plasmapheresis and rituximab for refractory cases.  \n\u2022 Consider HLA typing in research settings to study genetic susceptibility.","9.

Multiple randomized controlled trials (van Doorn et al., 1992; UK IG Trial, 1997) demonstrate equivalence in efficacy, but IVIG is preferred in many centers due to ease of administration and safety profile. Steroids have consistently been shown in randomized trials (Lucas et al., 1995) to lack benefit and are not recommended by AAN practice parameters (2000). Supportive care alone carries higher rates of respiratory failure and prolonged recovery. Thus, IVIG is the most appropriate management.","conceptual_foundation":"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. It is classified under ICD-11 code 8A60. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 includes AIDP, AMAN, and AMSAN variants. Immune\u2010mediated demyelination follows molecular mimicry after infections (Campylobacter jejuni, CMV). The peripheral nerve myelin sheath is attacked by complement\u2010fixing antibodies, leading to conduction block and weakness.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral nerve conduction relies on integrity of Schwann cell\u2013derived myelin. In GBS, autoreactive T cells and macrophages infiltrate the endoneurium, activating complement and releasing cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3) that disrupt myelin. IVIG exerts its effect by Fc receptor blockade, neutralizing pathogenic antibodies, and modulating complement activation. This contrasts with plasmapheresis, which removes pathogenic antibodies but requires vascular access and hemodynamic stability.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present 1\u20133 weeks after an infection with ascending symmetric weakness, areflexia, and albuminocytologic dissociation on CSF. Respiratory muscle involvement occurs in ~25% requiring mechanical ventilation. Autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) is seen in 20\u201330%. Variants include Miller Fisher syndrome (ophthalmoplegia, ataxia) and pure motor variants.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Clinical history and examination with nerve conduction studies (NCS)/EMG showing demyelination (prolonged distal latencies, slowed conduction velocity). CSF analysis shows elevated protein >45 mg/dL with <10 cells/mm3. Second-tier: Exclude differential diagnoses (porphyria, vasculitic neuropathy) with serologies. Third-tier: MRI spine with nerve root enhancement if atypical.","management_principles":"First-line: IVIG 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days (Level A recommendation, AAN 2019). Plasmapheresis (4\u20136 exchanges over 10\u201314 days) is equally effective. Corticosteroids are not recommended. Supportive care includes monitoring for respiratory failure, autonomic instability, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor pulmonary function (FVC) daily until recovery. Repeat NCS at 4\u20136 weeks if weakness persists. Rehabilitation with physical and occupational therapy is critical. Most patients begin to improve within 2\u20134 weeks; 80% walk unaided by 6 months.","clinical_pearls":"1) Albuminocytologic dissociation (high CSF protein with normal cell count) is characteristic. 2) IVIG and plasmapheresis are equivalent\u2014choose based on patient factors. 3) Steroids are not effective and may worsen outcomes. 4) Monitor FVC and negative inspiratory force for early respiratory failure detection. 5) Autonomic dysfunction can be life-threatening; continuous cardiac monitoring is advised.","references":"1. van Doorn PA et al.

Sensory loss is typically glove-and-stocking, not a patchy mononeuropathy. Reflexes are diminished globally rather than isolated to the left ankle and knee. Electrophysiology shows demyelinating features in multiple nerves bilaterally. CIDP is thus incorrect in this asymmetric, subacute, multisite presentation.\n\nOption B: Mononeuritis multiplex is characterized by asynchronous, multifocal axonal neuropathies due to vasculitic damage in about 30\u201370% of systemic vasculitis patients. Clinically it presents with patchy sensory loss and areflexia in multiple nerve distributions, such as peroneal and radial involvement. Elevated ESR in roughly 90% of vasculitic neuropathies and normal MRI further support this. Pathophysiologically, segmental infarction of vasa nervorum confirms vasculitic injury to peripheral nerves. This fits the patient\u2019s left leg numbness, right hand involvement, elevated ESR, and selective nerve findings.\n\nOption C: Subacute inflammatory demyelination generally refers to early CIDP or GBS variants. It manifests with progressive symmetric weakness over weeks, not patchy mononeuropathy. Reflex changes are widespread. EMG in demyelination shows prolonged distal latencies and delayed conduction velocity in multiple nerves rather than isolated peroneal axonal loss. Hence this is less likely.\n\nOption D: Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) typically evolves over days to four weeks with ascending symmetric weakness and areflexia, often following infection in 60% of cases. CSF shows albuminocytologic dissociation in 70\u201380%. MRI may show nerve root enhancement. The presentation is symmetric and proximal-distal, unlike the focal, multifocal picture here. Common misconception arises from subacute timing, but focal deficits and high ESR point to a vasculitic mononeuropathy multiplex rather than GBS.","conceptual_foundation":"Peripheral nerves consist of axons enveloped by Schwann cell myelin sheaths within endoneurium, grouped into fascicles by perineurium and encased by epineurium. The vasa nervorum, branching from nutrient arteries, supply oxygen and nutrients. Embryologically, neural crest cells differentiate into Schwann cells and contribute to dorsal root ganglia formation by week five of gestation. Normal physiology relies on saltatory conduction along myelinated fibers and axonal transport of neurotrophic factors. Vasculitic neuropathies disrupt microvascular perfusion, leading to segmental axonal degeneration in a patchy distribution. Related conditions include diabetic mononeuropathy, leprotic neuropathy, and Lyme-associated neuritis. Historically, early 20th century autopsy studies identified nerve fiber infarction in polyarteritis nodosa; immunohistochemistry advances in the 1970s demonstrated immune complex deposition in vessel walls. Key landmarks include the peroneal nerve at the fibular head, radial nerve in the spiral groove, and ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel\u2014sites prone to compressive and ischemic injury. Clinically, multifocal deficits in these zones suggest mononeuritis multiplex. Understanding the vascular anatomy and nerve microstructure is central to appreciating how systemic vasculitis selectively injures peripheral nerves without central nervous system involvement.","pathophysiology":"Mononeuritis multiplex arises when systemic vasculitic processes\u2014such as polyarteritis nodosa or microscopic polyangiitis\u2014trigger an immune-mediated attack on small to medium-sized vessels supplying peripheral nerves. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and immune complexes deposit in vessel walls, activating complement (C5a) and recruiting neutrophils that release reactive oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes. This causes endothelial damage, fibrinoid necrosis, and luminal occlusion. Ischemia leads to Wallerian degeneration in distal nerve segments. Mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP production impair sodium-potassium ATPase pumps, exacerbating axonal injury. Genetic associations include HLA-B51 in Beh\u00e7et\u2019s-related vasculitis. Cytokines such as TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 rise by 200\u2013400% in acute phases and correlate with ESR elevations above 50 mm/hr. Over days to weeks, endoneurial edema and macrophage infiltration further degrade myelin, though demyelination is secondary to axonal loss. Compensatory collateral sprouting is limited in severe ischemia, and remyelination cannot restore lost axons. Chronic inflammation can result in neuroma formation and chronic pain. Understanding these molecular and cellular cascades guides targeted immunosuppressive therapy to halt vascular injury and preserve nerve integrity over time.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop acute to subacute asymmetric sensory and motor deficits over one to six weeks. Initial symptoms often include paresthesias in a single nerve territory\u2014e.g., foot drop from common peroneal nerve infarction\u2014progressing to additional sites such as wrist drop if the radial nerve is involved five to ten days later. Examination reveals patchy sensory loss to light touch and pinprick, muscle weakness graded 2/5 to 4/5 in affected distributions, and decreased or absent reflexes confined to these nerves. In adults aged 40\u201360, severity peaks around three weeks in 80% of cases; pediatric manifestations are rarer but follow a similar course. Females may experience slightly higher prevalence of certain vasculitic neuropathies due to autoimmune predisposition but symptom expression is comparable. Associated systemic signs include low-grade fever (30%), weight loss (25%), and skin nodules (15%). Severity scales such as the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) quantify functional impairment. Red flags like rapid bilateral involvement within days or cranial nerve deficits suggest alternative diagnoses. Without treatment, up to 40% progress to irreversible deficits over six months. Early recognition of focal signs and systemic markers can improve outcomes significantly.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on asymmetric, multifocal neuropathy. Step 2: Laboratory workup includes ESR (elevated >50 mm/hr in ~90%) and CRP. Screen for ANCA, rheumatoid factor, ANA; sens/spec for ANCA is ~70%/90%. Step 3: Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and EMG: show axonal loss with reduced amplitudes (>30% drop) in affected nerves, preserved conduction velocity in uninvolved nerves. Step 4: Second-line: nerve biopsy (sural nerve) demonstrating transmural necrotizing vasculitis in 75% of specimens; gold standard. Step 5: Imaging: high-resolution MR neurography with T2 STIR sequences shows nerve enlargement and hyperintensity in ischemic segments. Contrast-enhanced MR angiography may reveal vessel irregularities. Step 6: CSF analysis often normal cell count, slight protein elevation <100 mg/dL, helping exclude GBS (protein >500 mg/dL). Step 7: Exclude diabetic, infectious, or compressive causes with blood glucose, Lyme serology, and ultrasound. Differential: CIDP shows symmetric demyelination with conduction block; GBS has CSF albuminocytologic dissociation in 80% and symmetric patterns. Mononeuritis multiplex is confirmed by multifocal axonal injury, elevated inflammatory markers, and biopsy-confirmed vasculitis.","management_principles":"First-line therapy: high-dose corticosteroids, e.g., prednisone 1 mg/kg/day orally for four to six weeks taper; methylprednisolone IV 1 g daily for three days in rapidly progressing cases. Adjunctive immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/day orally for three to six months or IV pulses (15 mg/kg every two weeks for three doses then monthly) achieves remission in approximately 70% of patients. Rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks is indicated for ANCA-associated cases refractory to cyclophosphamide. Azathioprine maintenance 2 mg/kg/day or methotrexate 15\u201325 mg weekly follows remission induction. Monitor CBC weekly, LFTs monthly, and urinalysis for cyclophosphamide toxicity. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg over five days may be used for severe sensory\u2013motor deficits with evidence of complement activation. Physical therapy focusing on strength and gait training reduces contracture risk by 40%. Surgical nerve decompression is reserved for compressive neuropathies, not vasculitic ischemia. Manage complications: osteoporosis prophylaxis with calcium/vitamin D, PPIs for steroid ulcers. In pregnancy, switch cyclophosphamide to azathioprine due to teratogenicity. Adjust doses in renal impairment (reduce by 25% if CrCl <50 mL/min).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be seen every two weeks during induction, then monthly during taper. Monitor ESR, CRP, CBC, LFTs at each visit, targeting ESR <20 mm/hr. NCS repeated at three and six months to assess axonal recovery; expect amplitude improvements by 20\u201330% if therapy effective. Long-term imaging not routinely required unless relapse suspected; MR neurography annually in refractory cases. Incidence of long-term complications such as chronic neuropathic pain occurs in about 25% of patients, requiring gabapentinoids. One-year remission rates with combined steroids and cyclophosphamide exceed 75%, five-year survival is 85%. Early rehabilitation should begin within one month, focusing on activities of daily living, with most returning to work by six to nine months. Educate patients on infection risk from immunosuppression, vaccination schedules, and sun protection. Driving may resume once lower limb strength >4/5 and reflexes nearly normalized. Refer to vasculitis patient support groups such as Vasculitis Foundation for resources and coping strategies.","clinical_pearls":"1. Mononeuritis multiplex presents with asymmetric 'stepwise' deficits\u2014think vasculitis when two or more nerves are involved. 2.

In generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) not in crisis, after optimizing acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, immunosuppression with corticosteroids is first-line.

Leber\u2019s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) causes acute/subacute vision loss without ophthalmoplegia. CPEO involves isolated ophthalmoplegia without systemic involvement. Myasthenia gravis features fatigable muscular weakness without multi-system mitochondrial signs.","conceptual_foundation":"KSS is a mitochondrial cytopathy due to large-scale mtDNA deletions, classically presenting before age 20. Key features include CPEO, ptosis, pigmentary retinopathy, heart block, cerebellar signs, and elevated CSF protein (>100 mg/dL). Differential includes CPEO-spectrum disorders (pure CPEO), LHON, MELAS, and myasthenia gravis.","pathophysiology":"mtDNA deletions impair oxidative phosphorylation in high-energy-demand tissues. Mitochondrial dysfunction in extraocular muscles leads to ophthalmoplegia, while conduction system involvement causes heart block; basal ganglia and cerebellar circuits may later be affected, leading to parkinsonism and ataxia.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset before age 20 with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia; pigmentary retinopathy in ~90%; third-degree heart block in ~50%; elevated CSF protein; cerebellar ataxia, proximal muscle weakness, parkinsonian features in later decades; cardiac conduction disease can be life-threatening without pacemaker.","diagnostic_approach":"Muscle biopsy shows ragged-red fibers on modified Gomori trichrome; genetic testing identifies single large-scale mtDNA deletions in blood or muscle. ECG and Holter monitor reveal conduction block. MRI may show basal ganglia involvement.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists. Supportive care includes pacemaker implantation for heart block, coenzyme Q10 supplementation (30\u201360 mg three times daily), physical therapy for muscle weakness and parkinsonism, and regular ophthalmologic follow-up.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual cardiology evaluation with ECG and Holter; ophthalmology every 6\u201312 months; neurologic assessment for progression; genetic counseling for family planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. CPEO + heart block in a <20-year-old = KSS; 2. Muscle biopsy with ragged-red fibers confirms diagnosis; 3. Pacemaker implantation is lifesaving; 4. mtDNA deletions are sporadic in >90%; 5. CoQ10 may offer symptomatic benefit.","references":"1. Kearns TP, Sayre GP. Retinitis pigmentosa, external ophthalmoplegia, and complete heart block. Am J Ophthalmol. 1958;47(3 Pt 1):491\u2013503. 2.
