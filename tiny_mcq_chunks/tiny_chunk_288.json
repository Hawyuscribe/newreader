Elevated antistreptolysin O titers and clinical features satisfy Jones criteria (AHA 2015). Restless leg syndrome involves an urge to move legs with uncomfortable sensations, not chorea. Stiff person syndrome presents with axial rigidity and painful spasms, not rapid, random movements. The YouTube link (A) is not a valid description, and option A is therefore incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Sydenham chorea falls under pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) in DSM-5-TR\u2019s movement disorder category. Pathologically, it is a basal ganglia dysfunction secondary to cross-reactive antistreptococcal antibodies targeting neuronal tissue (molecular mimicry). Related conditions include other choreas (Huntington\u2019s, chorea gravidarum) and acute rheumatic fever features (carditis, arthritis). Historical classification evolved from descriptions of \u2018St. Vitus\u2019 dance\u2019 in the 17th century to modern immunopathogenic understanding.","pathophysiology":"Normal basal ganglia function balances direct and indirect pathways to modulate movement. In Sydenham chorea, anti-streptococcal antibodies cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and bind to lysoganglioside and dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, triggering inflammatory cascades with cytokine release (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), altering GABAergic and dopaminergic transmission and leading to hyperkinetic movements. Animal models show striatal neuron antibody deposition correlates with choreiform activity.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset in school-aged children (mean age 8\u201310 years), female predominance. Symptoms: abrupt chorea, hypotonia, emotional lability, and behavioral changes. Chorea usually remits within 6 months but may recur. Associated rheumatic carditis in up to 50% of cases; arthritis in 70%. Differential includes Wilson\u2019s disease, lupus chorea, drug-induced chorea.","diagnostic_approach":"Based on revised Jones criteria: evidence of preceding streptococcal infection (elevated ASO/anti-DNase B titers) plus chorea as a major manifestation. Echocardiography to assess carditis. MRI typically normal but may show basal ganglia T2 hyperintensities. Sydenham chorea is a clinical diagnosis; no pathognomonic imaging findings.","management_principles":"Primary: symptomatic therapy with antipsychotics (haloperidol 0.01\u20130.03 mg/kg/day) or valproic acid (15\u201330 mg/kg/day), achieving \u226550% symptom reduction in 2\u20134 weeks.

These features map directly to progressive supranuclear palsy as defined by the 2017 MDS PSP criteria (H\u00f6glinger et al., Mov Disord 2017). Option A (MSA) often presents with prominent autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension, urinary dysfunction) and cerebellar signs rather than vertical gaze palsy. Option C (DLP) is not a recognized movement disorder entity. Option D (Advanced PD) can develop postural instability but rarely early vertical gaze palsy or retrocollis, and typically has a prolonged response to levodopa.","conceptual_foundation":"PSP is an atypical parkinsonian tauopathy classified in ICD-11 as 8A66.0 progressive supranuclear ophthalmoplegia and in DSM-5 under neurocognitive disorder due to other medical condition with movement impairment. It is distinguished from Parkinson\u2019s disease by poor levodopa responsiveness, early gait and ocular motor dysfunction, and rapid progression. Differential includes MSA, CBD, and Parkinson disease. PSP was first described by Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski in 1964; diagnostic criteria were refined in 1996 and updated by the Movement Disorder Society in 2017 into probable, possible, and suggestive categories. Pathologically, 4R tau accumulates in the basal ganglia, subthalamic nucleus, and midbrain, leading to neuronal loss and gliosis.","pathophysiology":"Normal vertical gaze relies on the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) in the midbrain. In PSP, hyperphosphorylated 4R tau aggregates in neurons and glia within the riMLF, oculomotor nucleus, and superior colliculus, causing vertical gaze palsy. Tau accumulation also affects globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus, disrupting basal ganglia output and resulting in axial rigidity and bradykinesia. Early fall risk arises from impaired postural reflexes due to midbrain atrophy. MRI shows midbrain atrophy and \u2018hummingbird\u2019 sign, reflecting selective neuronal loss.","clinical_manifestation":"PSP typically presents after age 60 with progressive unsteadiness and falls within the first year. Key signs include vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (inability to generate vertical saccades), axial rigidity, retrocollis, and mild limb bradykinesia. Nonmotor features include cognitive slowing and frontal executive dysfunction. Subtypes include PSP-Richardson syndrome (classical) and PSP-Parkinsonism. Untreated, median survival is ~7 years. Clinical criteria require combination of ocular motor dysfunction, postural instability, akinesia, and cognitive dysfunction.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical per 2017 MDS criteria. Use brain MRI to assess midbrain atrophy (midbrain to pons area ratio <0.12, sensitivity 80%, specificity 97%). Exclude vascular and structural lesions. DAT imaging shows presynaptic dopaminergic deficit but not specific. No reliable CSF biomarkers yet. Neuropsychological testing reveals frontal executive dysfunction. High pre-test probability in a 70-year-old with early falls and gaze palsy; positive MRI findings increase diagnostic certainty from possible to probable PSP.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapies exist. Levodopa trial up to 1,000 mg/day may yield modest limb rigidity improvement (\u226430% of patients) but often fails to improve axial symptoms. Rasagiline showed no significant benefit in small RCTs. Management focuses on fall prevention (physical therapy, assistive devices), management of gaze palsy (prism glasses), and treatment of dysphagia (speech therapy). Frontal cognitive impairment is addressed with cholinesterase inhibitors off-label. Botulinum toxin may relieve dystonic neck posturing.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up every 3\u20134 months to monitor gait stability, swallow function, and ocular motor signs. Assess for complications such as pneumonia due to dysphagia, UTIs from catheter use, and fractures from falls. Adjust physical therapy and adaptive equipment as disease progresses.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early falls (<1 year) is a red flag for atypical parkinsonism. 2. Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy is pathognomonic for PSP. 3. Midbrain atrophy on MRI (hummingbird sign) supports diagnosis. 4. Poor levodopa response distinguishes PSP from PD. 5.

The diagnostic criteria are: 1) presence of multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics at some time during the illness (they may not be concurrent); 2) tics persist for more than one year since first tic onset; 3) onset before age 18; and 4) tics are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. In this case, all criteria are met, and the history of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) further supports the diagnosis, since OCD is one of the most common comorbidities in Tourette syndrome.\n\nOption A (Chronic tic disorder) is incorrect because chronic tic disorder is diagnosed when either motor tics only or vocal tics only are present for more than one year; by definition it does not include both motor and vocal tics. Option C (Stereotypy) refers to repetitive, rhythmic, purposeless movements such as body rocking, hand flapping, or swaying, often seen in early childhood or autism spectrum disorders. These movements are more rhythmic, start at an earlier age, lack the suppressibility and premonitory urges characteristic of tics, and they often persist during sleep. Option D (Complicated ADHD/OCD) is incorrect despite the presence of OCD traits; ADHD and OCD alone cannot explain the presence of distinct motor and vocal tics that wax and wane over time. Moreover, there is no clinical evidence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms in this patient.\n\nPathophysiology of Tourette syndrome involves dysfunction in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, particularly involving the basal ganglia and frontal cortical regions. Abnormal dopaminergic transmission, especially heightened dopamine sensitivity in striatal pathways, appears central to tic generation. Genetic factors play a strong role, with heritability estimates of 50\u201380%, and both common and rare genetic variants implicated. Environmental influences, such as perinatal complications or streptococcal infections (in pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections, PANDAS), may modulate disease expression, though causality remains controversial.\n\nClinically, tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic movements or vocalizations. They typically begin between ages 4 and 6 years (motor tics) with vocal tics emerging around 2\u20133 years later. The natural history is waxing and waning over months to years, with peak severity often in early adolescence and partial remission in adulthood in many patients. Premonitory urges\u2014uncomfortable sensory phenomena preceding the tic\u2014are common and contribute to the patient\u2019s ability to voluntarily suppress tics for short periods. Suppression often leads to a rebound increase in tic severity later.\n\nComorbid conditions are present in up to 90% of patients with Tourette syndrome. The most frequent are attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (in 50\u201360%) and OCD (30\u201350%). Other comorbidities include anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, depression, and sleep disturbances. Recognition and management of comorbidities are essential to improve overall functional outcome and quality of life.\n\nManagement begins with psychoeducation and supportive therapy. Behavioral interventions, notably Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) and Habit Reversal Training (HRT), have demonstrated efficacy in reducing tic severity and improving control. Pharmacotherapy is reserved for moderate to severe tics causing significant impairment: first-line agents include risperidone, aripiprazole, or haloperidol. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, guanfacine) may be considered for milder cases or when antipsychotic side effects are a concern. Deep brain stimulation is an option for intractable, disabling cases in adulthood.\n\nClinical pearls:\n1. Tics often improve during focused activities and disappear during sleep.\n2. Premonitory urges are common and help differentiate tics from other movement disorders.\n3. Tourette syndrome is a clinical diagnosis; normal neurological examination and imaging are expected.\n4. Educating families about the benign nature and variability of tics reduces stigma and anxiety.\n5. Early identification and treatment of comorbid ADHD and OCD can significantly improve patient outcomes.\n\nReferences:\n1. American Psychiatric Association.

The need to turn the head to view the affected limb reflects the \u2018alien limb\u2019 phenomenon seen in CBD. Option A (PSP) is typically symmetrical with vertical gaze palsy and early falls. Option C (MSA) presents with autonomic failure and cerebellar or parkinsonian features but not cortical signs. Option D (FTD) is primarily a cognitive disorder without prominent dystonia or myoclonus.","conceptual_foundation":"CBD is a 4R tauopathy classified in ICD-11 under 8A63 Corticobasal degeneration.

Since its initial description by Rebeiz et al. in 1968 and pathological characterization by Boeve et al., diagnostic criteria were refined by Armstrong et al. in 2013, emphasizing asymmetry, cortical signs (apraxia, cortical sensory loss), and extrapyramidal features.","pathophysiology":"CBD pathology involves hyperphosphorylated 4R tau accumulation in cortical and basal ganglia neurons and astrocytes. Neuronal loss in the postcentral gyrus leads to cortical sensory deficits, while involvement of premotor and motor cortex produces limb apraxia, dystonia, and bradykinesia. Glial tau inclusions (\u2018astrocytic plaques\u2019) are characteristic. Neurodegeneration of the supplementary motor area disrupts planning of movement, and parietal lobe involvement underlies the alien limb phenomenon.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present after age 60 with progressive asymmetrical rigidity, dystonia (often upper limb), myoclonus, and cortical features such as ideomotor apraxia and cortical sensory loss. The alien limb phenomenon appears in 30\u201340%. Cognitive changes may occur later. CBD progresses over 6\u20138 years, with increasing disability and falls. Armstrong criteria require at least one cortical sign and one extrapyramidal sign for probable CBD.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical supported by MRI showing asymmetric frontoparietal atrophy (sensitivity 70%, specificity 90%). FDG-PET shows asymmetric hypometabolism. DAT imaging shows presynaptic deficit but is not specific. CSF tau patterns may suggest tauopathy but lack specificity. Rule out alternative etiologies with MRI. Pre-test probability in a patient with asymmetric dystonia and cortical signs is high (>85%), and imaging findings further increase certainty.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists. Levodopa trials yield minimal benefit for rigidity. Botulinum toxin injections reduce focal limb dystonia. Physical and occupational therapy maintain function.
