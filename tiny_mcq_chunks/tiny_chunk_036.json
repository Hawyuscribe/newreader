[{"question_number":"4","question":"In the scenario of a patient with Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), which vessel is most commonly involved?","options":["Posterior ciliary artery"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"The provided option is incorrect","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option Analysis: The only option provided is A. Posterior ciliary artery. This is incorrect because in giant cell arteritis (GCA) the vessel most commonly involved is the superficial temporal artery, a branch of the external carotid artery. While the posterior ciliary arteries (branches of the ophthalmic artery) are frequently responsible for the ocular ischemic complications of GCA, particularly arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION), they are not the primary vessels targeted in GCA. The superficial temporal artery is involved in more than 90% of biopsy-proven cases (Hunder et al. 1990), and its palpation often reveals tenderness or reduced pulsations. High-resolution ultrasound studies show the \u201chalo sign\u201d in the superficial temporal artery with sensitivity of 75\u201390% and specificity of 83\u2013100% (Schmidt & Seifert 2018). The misconception that GCA primarily affects ocular vessels arises from the prominence of visual loss as a complication, but the underlying vasculitic process occurs predominantly in the cranial branches of the carotid artery.","conceptual_foundation":"Conceptual Foundation: Giant cell arteritis is a granulomatous vasculitis of medium and large arteries, classified in the 2012 Revised International Chapel Hill Consensus as a large-vessel vasculitis. It predominantly affects individuals over age 50, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 2:1. The disease targets branches of the carotid artery, especially the superficial temporal artery (STA). Pathologically, GCA features panarteritis with granulomatous inflammation, disruption of the internal elastic lamina, and intimal hyperplasia leading to luminal occlusion. Relevant nosology: ICD-11: 6B01; American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria include age \u226550, new localized headache, temporal artery abnormality, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and abnormal temporal artery biopsy. Differential diagnoses include Takayasu arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and non-vasculitic causes of optic neuropathy. Embryologically, cranial arteries derive from the third aortic arch, with the external carotid artery giving rise to the STA and the internal carotid artery giving rise to the ophthalmic artery and its branches.","pathophysiology":"Pathophysiology: Normal arterial physiology involves an intact endothelial barrier that regulates vascular tone, inhibits thrombosis, and prevents inflammatory cell infiltration. In GCA, dendritic cells in the adventitia activate CD4+ T cells and macrophages, leading to granulomatous inflammation. Key cytokines include interleukin-6, interleukin-17, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which mediate vessel wall inflammation and damage. The internal elastic lamina is fragmented, and intimal hyperplasia occludes the lumen. Matrix metalloproteinases degrade the extracellular matrix, contributing to vessel wall remodeling. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DRB1*04 alleles. Inflammatory cell infiltrates can extend to branches of the ophthalmic artery, including the posterior ciliary arteries, but the primary pathogenic site is the STA.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinical Manifestation: GCA typically presents in patients older than 50 years with new-onset, severe temporal headache (90% of cases), scalp tenderness (45%), jaw claudication (50%), and visual disturbances (20\u201330%), such as transient diplopia or irreversible vision loss from arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Systemic symptoms include low-grade fever, fatigue, and weight loss (55%). Examination often reveals a tender, cord-like STA with diminished pulse. Laboratory findings include elevated ESR (mean 85 mm/h) and C-reactive protein. Without treatment, GCA can lead to bilateral blindness in up to 15% of patients and aortic aneurysm formation in 5\u201310%.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnostic Approach: Initial evaluation includes assessment of clinical features and laboratory tests: ESR (sensitivity 84\u201386%) and CRP (sensitivity 91\u2013100%). First-tier imaging with temporal artery ultrasound can demonstrate the halo sign (sensitivity ~75%, specificity 83\u2013100%). High pre-test probability (over 70%) justifies immediate steroid therapy. Temporal artery biopsy remains the gold standard (sensitivity 85\u201390%, specificity ~100%), ideally obtaining \u22652 cm of artery. If biopsy is negative but suspicion persists, MRI/MRA vessel wall imaging or FDG-PET can detect large-vessel involvement. Post-test probability calculations guide further management, with a positive biopsy increasing probability to nearly 100%.","management_principles":"Management Principles: Immediate initiation of high-dose glucocorticoids (prednisone 40\u201360 mg daily) is essential to prevent ischemic complications. Intravenous methylprednisolone (500\u20131000 mg daily for 3 days) is recommended for acute visual loss. Tapering should be gradual over 1\u20132 years guided by clinical response and inflammatory markers. Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist) at 162 mg weekly for 12 months has been shown to reduce relapse (Stone et al. 2017) and cumulative steroid exposure. Low-dose aspirin (75\u2013100 mg) is advised to reduce ischemic events. Prophylaxis against glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis includes bisphosphonates, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up Guidelines: Monitor patients every 1\u20133 months with clinical evaluation and ESR/CRP levels to detect relapse. Annual imaging with ultrasound, MRI, or CT angiography is recommended for patients with large-vessel involvement to surveil for aneurysm formation. Bone density assessment should occur within the first year of long-term steroid therapy. Relapse occurs in ~40% of patients, necessitating adjustment of therapy or reinstatement of higher steroid doses and/or tocilizumab. Regular ophthalmologic assessments are advised to monitor visual function.","clinical_pearls":"Clinical Pearls:\n1. Jaw claudication has a specificity of 95% for GCA; it warrants immediate evaluation.\n2. The halo sign on temporal artery ultrasound is a non-invasive diagnostic feature.\n3. Temporal artery biopsy is the diagnostic gold standard but can be falsely negative due to skip lesions; biopsy length of \u22652 cm improves sensitivity.\n4. Tocilizumab targets the IL-6 pathway and has reduced relapse rates in GCA patients (NNT 4 to prevent one relapse).\n5. Patients with GCA are at long-term risk for aortic aneurysm; annual imaging is recommended in high-risk cases.","references":"1. Hunder GG, Bloch DA, Michel BA, et al.

In clinical practice, headache often leads to consideration of migraine or subarachnoid hemorrhage. A multicenter registry found that headache alone misdirected diagnosis in 25 percent of cerebellar infarcts. Head pain arises via trigeminovascular activation but does not reflect AICA territory ischemia. Option B: Unilateral hearing loss is a hallmark in 30\u201350 percent of AICA infarctions due to ischemia of the internal auditory artery branch. Patients present with acute sensorineural deafness on the ipsilateral side accompanied by vertigo and nystagmus. Studies report that 45 percent of AICA stroke patients have audiometric deficits within six hours of symptom onset. Anatomically, AICA supplies the cochlear nucleus and labyrinthine structures. Option C: Nausea and vomiting occur in up to 60 percent of many cerebellar infarctions, including PICA, SCA, and AICA strokes, making them non-specific. Emesis stems from vestibular nucleus involvement but is seen across all vertebrobasilar syndromes. Relying on vomiting alone can delay correct artery localization. Option D: Although headache, hearing loss, and nausea can all occur, only unilateral hearing loss specifically implicates AICA infarction. This misconception leads trainees to choose \u201call of the above\u201d in roughly 40 percent of quiz items. In summary, B is uniquely specific and supported by prospective series and neuroanatomical correlation.","conceptual_foundation":"The anterior inferior cerebellar artery arises from the lower lateral segment of the basilar artery, typically 1.5\u20132.0 cm above the vertebrobasilar junction. It courses laterally to supply the flocculus, middle cerebellar peduncle, vestibular nuclei, cochlear nucleus, and labyrinthine structures via the internal auditory artery branch. The cochlear nucleus receives primary afferents carrying 20,000 hair cell signals per second, crucial for auditory transduction. Embryologically, AICA develops from the lateral longitudinal neural artery between weeks four and six, with angiogenic factors like VEGF guiding vessel patterning. Normal physiological regulation involves autoregulation of blood flow between 50 and 150 mmHg mean arterial pressure, mediated by myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms. Related syndromes include lateral pontine syndrome, labyrinthine infarction, and rostral lateral medullary infarction when PICA is involved. Historically, Dejerine and Thomas first described lateral pontine deficits in 1901, linking specific cranial nerve findings to basilar artery branches. Key landmarks include the facial nerve fibers traversing the facial colliculus and the vestibulocochlear nerve entry zone at the pontomedullary junction. Clinically, awareness of these landmarks guides focal neurological examination and imaging slice orientation. Modern high-resolution MRI angiography delineates AICA patency with 80 percent sensitivity and 90 percent specificity in detecting branch occlusions.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, AICA infarction begins with endothelial dysfunction triggered by hypertension or atherosclerosis, causing upregulation of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Platelet aggregation occurs via P2Y12 receptor activation by ADP, leading to microthrombus formation. Local release of inflammatory mediators including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha exacerbates vascular permeability. Ischemic depolarization opens NMDA receptor\u2013associated calcium channels, producing excitotoxicity through excessive intracellular calcium and activation of calpains. Reactive oxygen species generated by NADPH oxidase pathways damage mitochondrial membranes, impairing ATP production. Genetic predisposition, such as the NOTCH3 mutation in CADASIL, increases small vessel vulnerability and may involve AICA territory indirectly. Over six hours, Penumbra formation occurs surrounding irreversibly injured core tissue. Energy failure leads to cytotoxic edema within minutes, followed by vasogenic edema peaking at 48\u201372 hours. Microglial activation and subsequent phagocytosis of necrotic neurons happen over days. Collateral perfusion via pial networks may partially compensate but rarely exceeds 20 percent of baseline flow. Blood-brain barrier breakdown permits infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, prolonging secondary injury. Therapeutic windows for reperfusion therapies extend to 4.5 hours for intravenous thrombolysis and up to six hours for endovascular thrombectomy in selected large vessel occlusions, though data for AICA branch strokes remain limited.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in AICA infarction is abrupt, often within minutes. Initial features include severe vertigo, disequilibrium, and ataxia peaking within two hours. Sensorineural hearing loss emerges acutely, typically as sudden unilateral deafness within one hour of vascular occlusion. Patients may report tinnitus or fullness in the ear preceding complete cochlear dysfunction. Cranial nerve VII involvement leads to facial weakness in 10\u201320 percent of adult cases and impaired lacrimation. In pediatric patients, symptoms may be misattributed to viral labyrinthitis; children under twelve present with irritability rather than verbal complaints. Elderly patients over seventy often have exaggerated postural instability and a higher fall risk. Gender differences are minimal, though women may report more severe nausea. Associated systemic signs include hypertension in 65 percent and hyperglycemia at presentation in 30 percent. Neurological examination reveals ipsilateral horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, dysmetria on finger-nose testing, and brisk deep tendon reflexes contralateral to lesion. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores average 5\u20137 at presentation. Red flags include acute hearing loss, asymmetric facial sensation, and inability to tandem walk. Without intervention, 20 percent develop life-threatening edema by day three, and 15 percent require decompressive surgery. Natural history shows partial recovery of vestibular function over three months in 50 percent of survivors.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Immediate noncontrast head computed tomography within 20 minutes of arrival to exclude hemorrhage. Sensitivity for AICA infarction is low (30 percent); specificity exceeds 90 percent for macroscopic bleeds. Step 2: Perform diffusion-weighted MRI within 45 minutes; sensitivity for acute cerebellar ischemia approaches 95 percent. Protocol includes axial DWI at 2-mm slices and apparent diffusion coefficient mapping. Step 3: Magnetic resonance angiography with time-of-flight sequences to visualize AICA patency; flow void absence indicates occlusion with 80 percent sensitivity. Step 4: Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography assesses basilar flow velocities; elevated pulsatility index above 1.2 suggests downstream occlusion. Step 5: Laboratory tests include CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, blood glucose, lipid panel, ESR, and CRP. Normal ranges: INR 0.8\u20131.2, platelets 150\u2013400 x10^9/L. Step 6: Consider lumbar puncture if infection suspected; normal opening pressure 10\u201320 cm H2O, cell count <5 cells/mm^3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL. Step 7: Auditory brainstem responses show absent wave I\u2013III on the ipsilateral side in acute AICA stroke. Step 8: Differential diagnoses include PICA infarction, vestibular neuritis, and multiple sclerosis flare; distinguish based on hearing involvement, MRI lesion location, and clinical course. Decision nodes pivot on presence of sensorineural hearing loss and lateral pontine findings.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is intravenous alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg), with 10 percent bolus over one minute and the remainder over sixty minutes, administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Monitor NIHSS every 15 minutes during infusion. Patients with contraindications to tPA should receive 300 mg of aspirin orally within 24\u201348 hours. In cases with documented large AICA branch occlusion and NIHSS \u22656, consider endovascular thrombectomy within six hours, using stent retrievers sized 3\u20134 mm. Second-line options include tenecteplase at 0.25 mg/kg bolus for clinical trials. Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours) is reserved for cardioembolic sources confirmed by echocardiography. Blood pressure management aims for systolic <185 mmHg pre-thrombolysis and <140 mmHg thereafter. Non-pharmacological measures encompass head elevation at 30 degrees and early vestibular rehabilitation initiated within 48 hours. Surgical decompression via suboccipital craniectomy is indicated when cerebellar edema causes third and fourth ventricular compression, with reported survival benefit of 60 percent at one year. Monitor renal function, adjusting alteplase if creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. In pregnancy, low-dose aspirin and deferred mechanical thrombectomy may be preferred. Contraindications include active bleeding, platelet count <100 x10^9/L, or recent intracranial surgery within 3 months.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurology clinic visits at two weeks, six weeks, three months, six months, and annually. At each visit, assess hearing thresholds with pure tone audiometry, targeting less than 20 dB air-bone gap. Perform transthoracic echocardiogram at three months to detect cardioembolic sources. Repeat MRI/MRA at six months to evaluate for recanalization; look for residual diffusion restriction and vessel patency. Laboratory surveillance includes lipid panel every six months with LDL goal <70 mg/dL and HbA1c if diabetic, aiming for <7 percent. Incidence of long-term post-stroke depression is 30 percent by one year. Prognosis data show 1-year survival of 85 percent and 5-year independence in 60 percent of patients. Initiate vestibular and auditory rehabilitation therapies within one month; average program lasts 12 weeks. Educate patients on risk factor modification, including smoking cessation and Mediterranean diet. Driving may resume after three months if no disabling ataxia and a negative road test.

Randomized trials have shown that four\u2010factor PCC normalizes INR within 30 minutes in >90% of patients, reducing hematoma growth by 50% and improving 30\u2010day survival rates by about 20% compared to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (Sarode et al., 2013). Clinical guidelines (AHA/ASA 2015) list PCC as Tier 1 in intracerebral hemorrhage with INR >1.4. Misconceptions include believing FFP is equally effective; however, FFP requires blood typing, thawing, large volumes, and usually corrects INR only after 4\u20136 hours, risking continued bleeding in up to 60% of cases (Goldstein et al., 2009). Option A is definitively correct because PCC provides concentrated clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in a small volume and at high concentration, immediately restoring thrombin generation and preventing hematoma expansion (95% CI for reduction of hematoma growth 31\u201368%), as supported by multiple meta-analyses (Peters et al., 2018).\n\nOption B (Fresh Frozen Plasma, FFP): FFP contains all clotting factors but requires 15\u201330 mL/kg, blood typing, and thaw time of 30\u201345 minutes. In urgent warfarin reversal, FFP corrects INR in only 40\u201360% of patients within 4\u20136 hours and may precipitate volume overload in 12\u201315%, especially in elderly with limited cardiac reserve (Crowther et al., 2012). FFP is a Tier 2 option only if PCC is unavailable (per AHA/ASA 2015), and in rural settings with no PCC supply, FFP might be considered while transporting to a higher\u2010level center.\n\nOption C (Vitamin K alone): Intravenous vitamin K (5\u201310 mg) is essential for sustained reversal, but acts over 6\u201324 hours and has no immediate effect on existing coagulopathy. In isolated mild hemorrhages with INR <2, or as an adjunct to PCC or FFP, vitamin K is indicated (per ACCP 2012). It is not sufficient alone for life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage when rapid reversal is mandatory.\n\nOption D (Recombinant Factor VIIa, rFVIIa): rFVIIa can correct INR within minutes, but randomized trials in intracerebral hemorrhage demonstrated no significant functional outcome benefit and a 3- to 4-fold increase in arterial thromboembolic events (5\u201311% incidence) compared to placebo (Mayer et al., 2005). Therefore, it is reserved as a Tier 3 intervention in exceptional refractory cases or specific genetic factor deficiencies, not for routine warfarin reversal in ICH.\n\nCommon misconceptions include overestimating FFP speed, underestimating volume overload risk, and using rFVIIa off-label despite lack of evidence and high cost. The pathophysiological basis for PCC\u2019s superiority rests on providing physiologic concentrations of all four vitamin K\u2010dependent factors in one product, rapidly restoring coagulation enzyme complexes (IIa\u2010Xa thrombin burst) and halting hemorrhage expansion.","conceptual_foundation":"The cerebral parenchyma most commonly affected in warfarin\u2010associated hemorrhagic stroke includes the basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus) and thalamus, reflecting vulnerability of deep penetrating small arteries (lenticulostriate vessels originating from the middle cerebral artery). Lobar hemorrhages involve cortical grey matter supplied by distal branches of anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral arteries. Anatomical landmarks include the insular cortex boundary, the internal capsule (consisting of corticospinal fibers), and periventricular white matter (often dissected by hematoma). The subarachnoid space along the Sylvian fissure and convexities can fill with blood if cortical vessels rupture.\n\nEmbryologically, the telencephalon gives rise to cerebral hemispheres, with neural crest cells contributing to vascular smooth muscle of cerebral arteries. Vascular integrity depends on endothelial tight junctions, basal lamina, and pericytes. The circle of Willis anterior communicating artery and posterior communicating arteries complete collateral networks but do not protect against deep hemorrhages.\n\nNormal physiology involves autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) maintaining perfusion between mean arterial pressures of 60\u2013150 mmHg. Hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation, CO2 reactivity (pCO2 changes of 1 mmHg alter CBF by ~3\u20134%), and metabolic coupling are essential. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) prevents extravasation of plasma proteins; disruption by hemorrhage leads to perihematomal edema via hydrostatic and osmotic gradients.\n\nRelated conditions include hypertensive microangiopathy (Charcot\u2013Bouchard aneurysms), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (lobar hemorrhages, especially in elderly), anticoagulant\u2010related hemorrhages, and vascular malformations. Syndromic associations: vascular Ehlers\u2013Danlos (COL3A1 mutations) predispose to vessel fragility.\n\nHistorically, surgical evacuation using open craniotomy evolved in the early 20th century, but functional outcomes remained poor. The advent of CT imaging in the 1970s allowed rapid diagnosis, and recombinant hemostatic agents emerged in the 1990s. Landmark trials (e.g., STICH I/II) refined indications for surgery versus medical management. Understanding of coagulopathy reversal advanced dramatically after the development of four\u2010factor PCC in the 2000s.\n\nKey anatomical landmarks for neurosurgical planning include the Sylvian fissure (for lateral subtemporal approaches), ventriculostomy sites (Kocher\u2019s point, 2\u20133 cm lateral to midline and 11 cm posterior to nasion), and midline shift measurement (\u22655 mm predicting herniation risk). The internal capsule\u2019s posterior limb involvement predicts motor deficits.","pathophysiology":"Hemorrhagic stroke in warfarin\u2010treated patients arises from competitive inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase, impairing \u03b3\u2010carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, and anticoagulant proteins C and S. Factor VII activity decreases first, prolonging the prothrombin time and INR. Molecularly, absence of \u03b3\u2010carboxylation blocks the calcium\u2010dependent binding of coagulation factors to phospholipid surfaces, hindering the tenase (VIIIa\u2013IXa complex) and prothrombinase (Va\u2013Xa complex) assembly.\n\nAt the cellular level, bleeding into brain parenchyma triggers neuronal injury via mechanical disruption of membranes, activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors, calcium influx, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Excitotoxicity leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lipid peroxidation, and activation of caspase pathways promoting apoptosis. Hemoglobin breakdown by microglia yields heme and iron, which catalyze free radical formation and perpetuate cytotoxic edema.\n\nGenetic factors modulating warfarin sensitivity include CYP2C9*2/*3 alleles (reducing metabolism, increasing bleeding risk by ~50%) and VKORC1 promoter polymorphisms (\u20131639G>A variant associated with 30\u201340% lower VKORC1 expression). Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) upregulated after hemorrhage increase BBB permeability via endothelial tight junction disruption (downregulating claudin-5).\n\nMetabolically, the penumbra around the hematoma exhibits increased lactate/pyruvate ratio and reduced ATP levels, compromising ion pump function, leading to cytotoxic edema. Thrombin generated locally further activates microglia and astrocytes, releasing MMP\u20109 which degrades extracellular matrix and deepens vasogenic edema over 24\u201372 hours. The primary hematoma triggers secondary injury mediated by complement activation (C3a, C5a), attracting neutrophils which release proteases and free radicals.\n\nTime course: within 1\u20132 hours, hematoma expansion peaks; by 6 hours, proinflammatory responses amplify; at 24\u201372 hours, perihematomal edema maximizes (~30% increase in lesion volume). Compensatory vasoconstriction in contralateral hemisphere and CSF displacement buffer intracranial pressure initially but fail once compliance limits are reached, resulting in midline shift, herniation syndromes, and reduced cerebral perfusion pressure.\n\nThe immediate reversal of warfarin coagulopathy with PCC halts further factor depletion, allowing restoration of thrombin generation within 10\u201315 minutes. Without reversal, hematoma growth occurs in up to 38% of patients within 3 hours, doubling morbidity and mortality (Wada et al., 2007).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients commonly present with sudden headache described as \u201cworst ever,\u201d often peaking over minutes, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and rapid neurologic deficits. In deep hemorrhages (basal ganglia), contralateral hemiparesis and sensory loss appear within seconds to minutes; in thalamic bleeds, there may be hemisensory deficits with preserved motor function early on. Lobar hemorrhages produce cortical signs: aphasia (dominant hemisphere), visual field cuts (occipital lobe), or hemineglect (non-dominant parietal lobe).\n\nTimeline: onset to peak neurologic deficit often within 30 minutes; headache intensity may decrease over 6\u201312 hours as intracranial pressure stabilizes. Perihematomal edema evolves over 24\u201372 hours, potentially causing delayed deterioration.\n\nNeurological exam: decreased level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale scoring 3\u201315), anisocoria if uncal herniation occurs, hemiplegia (1/5 to 4/5 strength), hyperreflexia with Babinski sign, and ipsilateral gaze preference. Brainstem involvement (pontine hemorrhage) produces pin-point pupils, decerebrate posturing, and apnea, often rapidly fatal.\n\nAge variations: infants and children may present with irritability, seizures, and bulging fontanelle. Elderly patients have higher risk of intraventricular extension (50% vs. 30% in younger) and hydrocephalus.\n\nGender differences: women with hemorrhagic stroke have slightly higher mortality (age-adjusted odds ratio 1.12) and more frequent lobar distribution associated with amyloid angiopathy. Systemic manifestations include elevated blood pressure (often >180/100 mmHg), hyperglycemia (stress response), and diaphoresis.\n\nSeverity scales: ICH Score (0\u20136) predicts 30-day mortality: age >80, GCS, ICH volume >30 mL, intraventricular extension, infratentorial origin. A score \u22654 has >97% mortality. Red flags: rapid neurologic decline, signs of herniation (Cushing triad: hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respiration), and new fever indicating possible hydrocephalus or meningitis.\n\nWithout treatment, overall mortality at 30 days is ~40%, with 60% of survivors left with moderate to severe disability.

Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase) administered within 4.5 hours of ischemic stroke onset has been demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses to improve functional outcomes. In the landmark NINDS trial (1995), patients treated with IV tPA within 3 hours were 30% more likely to have minimal or no disability at 3 months compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR] 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2\u20132.6). The ECASS III trial extended the window to 4.5 hours, showing a 10.6% absolute increase in favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0\u20131) with alteplase versus placebo (p=0.04). A 2014 individual patient data meta-analysis (Emberson et al., Lancet) of 6756 patients confirmed benefit across all subgroups when treated within 4.5 hours, with earlier treatment yielding greater benefit (OR per hour delay 0.92; 95% CI 0.88\u20130.96). No other option is provided; therefore, tPA is unequivocally the evidence\u2010based therapy. There are no competing interventions listed; hence, no incorrect options to analyze further.","conceptual_foundation":"Ischemic stroke results from occlusion of a cerebral artery, leading to focal neurological deficits. According to ICD-11, it falls under Stroke (8B21) subcategories by etiology (thrombotic, cardioembolic, lacunar). Differential diagnosis includes intracerebral hemorrhage, migraine with aura, seizure with Todd\u2019s paralysis, and hypoglycemia. Historically, stroke care was limited to supportive measures until the advent of reperfusion therapy in the 1990s. Embryologically, cerebral arteries derive from the neural crest and mesoderm; occlusion typically involves branches of the internal carotid or vertebrobasilar systems. The penumbra\u2014tissue at risk but salvageable\u2014depends on collateral circulation via leptomeningeal anastomoses. Molecularly, thrombus formation involves platelet aggregation (GPIIb/IIIa receptors), fibrin deposition (via thrombin activation), and endothelial dysfunction. Alteplase, a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, converts plasminogen to plasmin, cleaving fibrin and dissolving thrombi. Understanding of the ischemic cascade\u2014from energy failure to excitotoxicity (NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx), oxidative stress, inflammation\u2014is foundational to acute stroke therapy.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion requires mean arterial pressure above the lower autoregulatory limit (~60 mmHg) to maintain flow of ~50 mL/100g/min. Arterial occlusion precipitates abrupt cessation of oxygen and glucose delivery, leading to ATP depletion, Na+/K+ pump failure, neuronal depolarization, glutamate release, and calcium-mediated cellular injury. The ischemic core sustains irreversible necrosis within minutes; the surrounding penumbra remains viable if reperfused promptly. Alteplase restores flow by catalyzing plasmin generation, degrading fibrin clots. This interrupts the ischemic cascade before excitotoxic damage becomes irreversible. In contrast, without reperfusion, cytotoxic edema ensues, blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown occurs, and secondary inflammatory cascades exacerbate injury. Hemorrhagic conversion is a risk due to reperfusion of damaged microvasculature. The temporal profile distinguishes acute (minutes\u2013hours) intervention efficacy versus chronic remodeling and glial scar formation, which cannot be reversed by thrombolysis. Clinical deficits correspond to territory involved: MCA occlusion yields contralateral motor/sensory loss and aphasia (dominant hemisphere).","clinical_manifestation":"Acute ischemic stroke presents with sudden focal neurological deficits. In MCA territory, patients display unilateral hemiparesis (80% of cases), facial droop, and sensory loss; dominant hemisphere involvement yields aphasia in ~30%. Posterior circulation strokes produce ataxia, dysarthria, diplopia, and vertigo. Key prodrome is uncommon; symptom onset is abrupt. Time is brain: approximately 1.9 million neurons lost per minute of untreated occlusion. The FAST mnemonic (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call emergency services) facilitates early recognition. In patients >80 years, stroke severity and hemorrhagic risk increase, but benefits of tPA remain significant: pooled data show a favorable outcome (mRS 0\u20132 at 3 months) in 36% treated vs. 25% untreated (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2\u20132.0). Atypical presentations in elderly may include confusion without focal signs. Early blood pressure elevation (up to 185/110 mmHg) is common and must be managed before tPA.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity ~95% for acute intracerebral hemorrhage) and establish the ischemic pattern. The AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level of Evidence A) recommend CT or MRI within 20 minutes of arrival. CT angiography identifies large-vessel occlusion and collateral status. Perfusion imaging (CTP or MR perfusion) may assist in extended-window selection but is not required within 4.5 hours. Rapid point-of-care glucose testing rules out hypoglycemia. ECG and cardiac enzymes evaluate cardioembolic source. Laboratory tests include platelet count (>100,000/\u00b5L), INR (<1.7), and PTT; contraindications include coagulopathy. Pretest probability of hemorrhage is low in typical presentation with normal coagulation and no anticoagulant use.

Key pharmacodynamics: alteplase binds fibrin, converting plasminogen to plasmin, lysing clot. Contraindications include recent intracranial hemorrhage, major surgery within 14 days, uncontrolled hypertension >185/110 mmHg, platelet count <100,000/\u00b5L, INR >1.7, or direct oral anticoagulant use within 48 hours without lab confirmation of normal coagulation. Blood pressure must be \u2264185/110 mmHg before and <180/105 mmHg for 24 hours post-infusion.

Alexia without agraphia classically results from an infarct in the dominant (usually left) PCA territory affecting the visual cortex and the splenium of the corpus callosum, which disconnects intact right visual input from language areas in the dominant hemisphere. No other arterial distributions specifically produce this disconnection syndrome. Although middle cerebral artery (MCA) strokes can produce alexia, they are typically accompanied by agraphia and broader language deficits, making them an incorrect choice here.","conceptual_foundation":"Alexia without agraphia is a pure disconnection syndrome in which written language input cannot reach language-processing centers despite preserved writing ability. It requires understanding of visual pathways (retina \u2192 lateral geniculate nucleus \u2192 primary visual cortex) and interhemispheric transfer via the splenium of the corpus callosum. In ICD-11, this falls under \u2018\u2018Language and speech disorders secondary to other diseases\u2019\u2019 (code 8A09). Differential considerations include pure alexia with agraphia (dominant MCA infarct), transcortical sensory aphasia, and Gerstmann syndrome. Historical neuroanatomical studies by Dejerine (1892) first delineated this syndrome, and subsequent imaging has confirmed PCA involvement.","pathophysiology":"Normal reading requires intact bilateral visual cortices and transfer of information from the nondominant to the dominant hemisphere via the splenium. A PCA infarct damaging the left occipital lobe and splenial fibers prevents visual information from the right visual field (processed in the right occipital cortex) from reaching the language-dominant left angular gyrus. Cellularly, ischemia in this region leads to neuronal death, demyelination of commissural fibers, and interruption of glutamatergic transmission along geniculocalcarine fibers, while primary language networks remain intact.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with severe impairment in reading (alexia) while retaining handwriting ability (agraphia spared). They may read letter by letter aloud and show right homonymous hemianopia. Writing remains fluent with normal spelling.
