Acute bilateral lower limb weakness with back pain and urinary incontinence, combined with preservation of proprioception, is characteristic of anterior spinal artery (ASA) syndrome. In ASA syndrome, the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord supplied by the ASA are infarcted, leading to loss of motor function and pain/temperature sensation below the lesion, while dorsal columns (proprioception and vibration) are spared. Transverse myelitis (B) typically evolves over hours to days with inflammatory signs and often involves all modalities of sensation. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (C) manifests as ascending flaccid paralysis without spinal sensory level or acute back pain, and deep tendon reflexes are diminished or absent rather than a dense paraplegia with a sensory dissociation. Syringomyelia (D) produces a cape-like distribution of pain and temperature loss in the cervical region, with gradual onset over months to years rather than an acute paraplegia. Studies of acute spinal cord ischemia demonstrate sudden onset of pain and motor deficits, and MRI diffusion-weighted imaging has a sensitivity of approximately 85% in the first 24 hours. A retrospective series (Savitz et al., 2007) reported that 98% of ASA infarcts present with acute back pain and 83% have motor paraplegia with preserved proprioception, confirming the clinical pattern seen here.","conceptual_foundation":"Spinal cord infarction, specifically ASA syndrome, involves ischemia of the anterior two-thirds of the cord. The ASA arises from vertebral arteries and radicular branches and supplies the anterior horn cells (motor), lateral spinothalamic tracts (pain/temperature), and sympathetic pathways. Dorsal columns are spared via the posterior spinal arteries. In ICD-11, spinal cord infarction is coded under \u20188A02.2 \u2013 Vascular myelopathies\u2019. Differential diagnoses include inflammatory myelopathies (transverse myelitis), compressive etiologies (epidural hematoma or abscess), and demyelinating disorders. Historically, Molinari described ASA syndrome in 1907. Embryologically, the spinal cord vasculature develops from longitudinal neural arteries, and failure of collaterals predisposes to watershed infarcts. Understanding of ASA infarcts has evolved with MRI and angiographic studies delineating collateral feeders and variations in ASA origin.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: the ASA perfuses anterior spinal cord grey matter and adjacent white matter. Infarction occurs when perfusion pressure falls below critical thresholds, often due to aortic surgery, hypotension, or thromboembolism. Molecularly, ischemia triggers excitotoxic glutamate release, calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species formation, and cell death pathways (necrosis and apoptosis). Infarction of anterior horn cells causes flaccid paralysis, while spinothalamic tract loss explains pain/temperature deficits. Proprioceptive fibers in the dorsal columns remain intact due to separate posterior spinal arteries. Secondary inflammatory cascades exacerbate injury. Compared to transverse myelitis, which features immune-mediated demyelination and breakdown of the blood-spinal cord barrier, infarction shows microvascular necrosis without primary inflammation. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 involves peripheral nerve demyelination, not central ischemia, and syringomyelia involves expansion of a central cavity disrupting crossing fibers.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with spinal cord infarction present acutely (minutes to hours) with severe back or neck pain at the level of lesion, followed by rapid motor paralysis below the lesion. Urinary retention and bowel dysfunction occur in >80% of cases. Pin and temperature sensation are lost; vibration and proprioception preserved. Motor level corresponds to the dermatome of infarction. ASA syndrome most commonly affects thoracic cord (T8\u2013L1). Natural history: partial recovery in 20\u201350% over weeks to months; poor prognostic factors include older age, complete motor loss, and delay to diagnosis. By contrast, transverse myelitis evolves over days and often features sensory level including vibration loss. GBS evolves over days to weeks without sensory level. Syringomyelia has insidious onset over years.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI spine with diffusion-weighted imaging is the test of choice. MRI within 12 hours shows cord swelling and diffusion restriction in ASA territory (sensitivity ~85%, specificity 90%). T2-weighted imaging shows hyperintensity in anterior cord. Vascular imaging (CT angiography or MR angiography) assesses ASA patency and aortic pathology. CSF analysis is usually normal or shows mild protein elevation; helps exclude inflammatory myelopathy (CSF pleocytosis in transverse myelitis). Somatosensory evoked potentials demonstrate preserved dorsal column function. Second-tier: digital subtraction angiography if endovascular intervention is considered. Third-tier: biopsy is not indicated. Pre-test probability is high in acute presentation with pain and paraplegia; PPV of MRI appearance in appropriate clinical context exceeds 95%.","management_principles":"Management is largely supportive. No proven thrombolytic therapy exists for spinal cord infarction outside clinical trials. Acute care focuses on hemodynamic optimization\u2014maintain mean arterial pressure >85 mmHg\u2014and corticosteroids have no established role. Rehabilitation begins early with physical and occupational therapy, focusing on strengthening, spasticity management, and bladder/bowel programs. Trials of neuroprotective agents (naloxone, tirilazad) have not demonstrated efficacy. In selected large-vessel occlusions due to aortic dissection or iatrogenic injury, endovascular stenting or surgical revascularization may be considered. Antiplatelet therapy is used if an atherothrombotic cause is identified.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes regular neurological assessments (weekly during acute rehab), MRI at 3\u20136 months to assess myelomalacia, and urodynamic studies for bladder function. Monitor blood pressure and vascular risk factors. Functional outcome is measured by ASIA impairment scale and modified Barthel Index at 6 and 12 months. Prognostic indicators: incomplete motor injury predicts better recovery. Continued outpatient therapy for gait training, spasticity management (baclofen or tizanidine), and prevention of complications (pressure ulcers, urinary tract infections).","clinical_pearls":"1. Acute back pain with sudden paraplegia and dissociated sensory loss (pain/temp lost, proprioception spared) is pathognomonic for anterior spinal artery syndrome. 2.

In acute hemispheric (cortical) stroke, patients often exhibit a forced conjugate gaze deviation toward the side of the cortical lesion. This phenomenon is well\u2010documented in stroke neurology literature and is attributed to interruption of the contralateral frontal eye field (FEF), leading to unopposed activity of the intact ipsilateral FEF and paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). A prospective study by Ringman et al. (2005) demonstrated that ipsilesional gaze deviation occurred in approximately 45% of acute cortical strokes, with a specificity of 88% for cortical involvement (Ringman JM et al., Neurology 2005;64:1734\u20131737). In contrast, gaze deviation away from the lesion suggests a brainstem or pontine lesion, and toward hemiparesis or away from hemiparesis are indirect descriptors that can be ambiguous. \n\nOption B (Away from the lesion) is incorrect because this pattern is characteristic of pontine gaze palsy, where interruption of the ipsilateral PPRF results in contralesional gaze preference. Option C (Toward hemiparesis) is a redescription of toward the lesion, since hemiparesis is contralateral to the lesion. While this option restates the phenomenon, it is less precise than option A and may lead to confusion in localization. Option D (Away from hemiparesis) is essentially describing contralesional deviation, again typical of pontine lesions rather than hemispheric strokes. Thus, A remains the most accurate and unambiguous choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding gaze deviation in stroke requires knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of horizontal conjugate eye movements. The FEF, located in Brodmann area 8 of the frontal lobe, initiates voluntary saccades. It projects via the internal capsule to the PPRF in the ipsilateral pons, which then activates the abducens nucleus. The abducens nucleus sends signals to the lateral rectus of the ipsilateral eye and via the medial longitudinal fasciculus to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus to coordinate medial rectus activation in the other eye. In a healthy individual, bilateral FEFs maintain gaze symmetry.\n\nIn ICD-11, cortical stroke is classified under 8A80 (cerebral infarction). Differential diagnoses of gaze deviation include frontal lobe tumors, traumatic brain injury, or epileptic seizures affecting the FEF. Historically, Denny-Brown and Russell (1941) first described the ipsilesional gaze preference in stroke. Embryologically, the FEF arises from the dorsal telencephalon, while the PPRF derives from the basal plate of the pons. Blood supply to the FEF is via the superior division of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), explaining why MCA strokes frequently present with gaze deviation towards the lesion. Key neurotransmitters include glutamate for excitatory FEF output and GABAergic interneurons modulating cortical excitability. Genetic factors influencing stroke susceptibility (e.g., NOTCH3 mutations in CADASIL) may indirectly predispose to gaze disturbances by increasing cortical infarct risk.","pathophysiology":"Normal horizontal gaze: the contralateral FEF sends excitatory signals to the ipsilateral PPRF, ultimately driving conjugate eye movements away from the stimulated cortex. In hemispheric stroke, an infarct in the FEF disrupts this excitatory input. The intact contralateral FEF then dominates, causing both eyes to deviate toward the side of the lesion. Cellularly, ischemia in the FEF leads to energy failure, loss of ion gradient homeostasis, and neurotransmitter dysregulation. Excitotoxicity from excessive glutamate release further exacerbates neuronal injury. Local inflammation and free radical generation widen the infarct, perpetuating loss of function in cortical eye\u2010movement pathways. \n\nIn contrast, pontine lesions damaging the PPRF cause ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy, leaving the intact contralateral FEF unopposed, resulting in gaze away from the lesion. The differing pathophysiology underlies distinct clinical presentations and localizations. Whereas cortical stroke involves interruption of long corticopontine fibers, brainstem lesions directly injure the integrating center for horizontal gaze. Temporal progression: in hyperacute stroke (<6 hours), gaze deviation is often the first sign; subacute phase sees partial recovery with collateral revascularization; chronic phase may reveal persistent gaze palsy or dysconjugacy depending on infarct size and neuroplasticity.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with acute MCA territory infarction frequently present with a sudden forced gaze deviation toward the lesioned hemisphere. This is often accompanied by contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and aphasia if the dominant hemisphere is involved. Ipsilesional gaze preference is most pronounced in the hyperacute period and may diminish over days to weeks. Subtypes include purely cortical gaze palsy (with preserved brainstem ocular motor function) versus mixed cortical\u2013subcortical presentations. Typical presentation: lateral gaze deviation, facial weakness, arm>leg paresis. Atypical: small cortical infarcts may cause subtle gaze drift rather than forced deviation. Prodromal features such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) with brief gaze abnormalities can precede stroke. \n\nDiagnostic criteria (AHA/ASA 2018): rapid onset of focal neurological deficit with imaging evidence of infarction in the MCA distribution. Sensitivity of gaze deviation for cortical stroke is approximately 67%, specificity 88%. In geriatric patients, presentations may be confounded by preexisting ocular motility disorders; in young patients, stroke is rare and other causes (migrainous infarction, vasculitis) should be considered. Natural history: without reperfusion, gaze deviation can persist indefinitely with established infarction, leading to ocular misalignment and diplopia.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: urgent noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 95% for acute blood within 24 hours). CT angiography to identify large\u2010vessel occlusion (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) includes assessment of gaze deviation (item 2) with high interrater reliability (kappa=0.87). Second-tier: diffusion\u2010weighted MRI for infarct confirmation (sensitivity 97%, specificity 100% for acute ischemia), MRA or CTA perfusion to assess penumbra. Third-tier: digital subtraction angiography for endovascular planning (gold standard, sensitivity/specificity >98%), transcranial Doppler for bedside monitoring (sensitivity 90%, specificity 89%). Guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018) classify CT as class I recommendation; MRI as IIa. Pretest probability: in a comatose patient with acute onset gaze deviation, post-test probability of cortical stroke >90%. Resource-limited settings may substitute CT and clinical exam.","management_principles":"Acute management per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines: intravenous alteplase 0.9 mg/kg within 4.5 hours (Class I, Level A), mechanical thrombectomy for LVO up to 24 hours in select patients (DAWN/DEFUSE 3 trials; Class I, Level A). Monitor for hemorrhagic transformation with repeat CT at 24 hours. Secondary prevention: dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel) for 21 days post-TIA/stroke (CHANCE trial), high\u2010intensity statin therapy (TARGET LDL <70 mg/dL), BP control (target <140/90 mmHg). Manage complications: edema (decompressive hemicraniectomy in malignant MCA infarction, Class IIb, Level B). Nonpharmacologic: early mobilization, rehabilitation (physical, occupational, speech therapy). Adjustments for renal/hepatic impairment when anticoagulation is indicated (e.g., direct oral anticoagulants).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status with NIHSS daily during acute hospitalization; repeat imaging if deterioration occurs. Outpatient follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months post-stroke to assess for secondary prevention adherence and rehabilitation progress. Lipid panel every 3\u20136 months until at goal. Carotid imaging at 6 months in large-vessel disease. Functional assessments using Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. Long-term: blood pressure monitoring, lifestyle counseling, glucose control in diabetics. Preventive surveillance for post-stroke depression and cognitive impairment.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Option C (IV thrombolysis) cannot be safely administered until hemorrhage is excluded on imaging.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute stroke evaluation relies on rapid neuroimaging to guide therapy. Ischemic stroke accounts for approximately 85% of strokes, hemorrhagic for 15%. The key initial decision point is whether intracranial hemorrhage is present.

These imaging findings dictate subsequent management algorithms as per current AHA/ASA and ESO guidelines.","pathophysiology":"Ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion leading to infarction through excitotoxicity, ionic pump failure, and cytotoxic edema.

It presents with hypertension in 75% and dissection in 10\u201315%, but rarely with acute thunderclap headache and rapid-onset multifocal vasoconstriction. Cerebral FMD often involves the intracranial vertebral arteries rather than diffuse vasospasm.\n\nOption B (Isolated angiitis of the CNS): Primary CNS angiitis (also called PACNS) occurs in 2\u20133 per million, with subacute headache over weeks, progressive cognitive decline, or focal deficits. Cerebral angiography may show segmental narrowing, but CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u201350 cells/\u03bcL) and elevated protein (100\u2013200 mg/dL), unlike the normal CSF in our case.\n\nOption C (Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome): RCVS presents in 80\u201390% of patients with thunderclap headaches peaking in <1 minute, often triggered by SSRIs, triptans, or postpartum state. Angiography shows multifocal vasoconstriction of anterior and posterior circulation that reverses by 12 weeks in 95% of cases.

Angiographic vasospasm appears after day 4\u201314, not immediately, making acute normal angiographic segments unlikely in an SSRI\u2010triggered thunderclap scenario.\n\nCommon misconceptions include confusing PACNS with RCVS based on vascular imaging alone. However, inflammatory markers and CSF differentiate them. Studies (Calabrese 1992; Ducros 2012) emphasize reversibility within 12 weeks and SSRI association in >30% of RCVS patients, cementing option C as correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) involves transient dysfunction of cerebral arterial tone in the Circle of Willis and its branches, including anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, posterior cerebral, and perforating arteries. Sympathetic innervation of these vessels originates from the superior cervical ganglia and plexuses surrounding the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. During embryogenesis, the cranial neural crest gives rise to these sympathetic fibers and perivascular cells, whose proper migration is essential for vessel autoregulation.\n\nUnder normal physiology, cerebral vessels maintain constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) of 50\u201360 mL/100 g/min via myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms. Smooth muscle cells respond to transmural pressure changes through stretch-sensitive ion channels (TRPV4), and endothelium-derived nitric oxide modulates tone. The blood\u2013brain barrier restricts inflammatory cell entry, preserving microvascular integrity.\n\nHistorically, RCVS was first described in 1988 by Call et al. as benign angiopathy of the CNS; it was later refined by Calabrese in 2007 to emphasize reversibility by three months. RCVS is related to other vasospastic syndromes like migraine with aura and vasospastic angina via shared pathways in serotonin and endothelin-1 signaling. Key anatomical landmarks include the carotid siphon, a frequent site of vasoconstriction, and leptomeningeal collaterals, which enlarge during reversible vasospasm to preserve perfusion. Understanding these structures is critical for interpreting angiographic findings and avoiding misdiagnosis with primary angiitis of the CNS or vasculopathies like fibromuscular dysplasia.","pathophysiology":"RCVS arises from dysregulated cerebral arterial tone due to transient imbalance between vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory mediators. At the molecular level, upregulation of endothelin-1 and activation of Rho-kinase in smooth muscle cells lead to sustained phosphorylation of myosin light chains, promoting vasoconstriction. Concurrently, decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) due to oxidative stress impairs cGMP-mediated relaxation.\n\nEscitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), increases synaptic 5-HT levels by 60\u201380%, which can overstimulate 5-HT1B/1D receptors on cerebral vessels, triggering vasospasm in up to 25% of SSRI users reported in case series. Intracellular calcium influx via L-type channels further amplifies contraction. No specific gene mutations have been linked directly to RCVS, but polymorphisms in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and Rho-kinase genes (ROCK2) may confer susceptibility.\n\nInflammatory mediators are minimal, distinguishing RCVS from vasculitis; CSF analysis typically shows <5 leukocytes/\u03bcL and proteins <45 mg/dL. Energy requirements for smooth muscle contraction temporarily exceed local ATP production, but collateral circulation compensates within days. Pathological changes evolve rapidly over hours to days, peaking around two weeks, with structural remodeling reversing by 12 weeks in 90% of patients. Compensatory vasodilation in leptomeningeal collaterals helps maintain perfusion but may predispose to cortical subarachnoid hemorrhages in 20% of cases when autoregulation fails.","clinical_manifestation":"RCVS presents acutely with thunderclap headaches peaking within 1 minute and averaging 8\u201310/10 pain intensity. The first headache typically occurs at rest or during exertion, with recurrences in 80% within the first two weeks. Nausea and vomiting accompany 40\u201360% of episodes. Neurological examination is normal in 70\u201380% at onset; mild focal deficits (e.g., aphasia, hemiparesis) appear in 10% if cortical infarcts develop.\n\nPediatric patients (age <18) report less severe pain but more seizures (15%) than adults (5%). Elderly patients (>60) are at increased risk for infarction (20%) compared to young adults (5%). Women constitute 60\u201380% of cases, often postpartum or on vasoactive medications. Associated systemic signs are rare, though transient hypertension (BP spikes to 180/100 mmHg) can occur in 30%.\n\nSeverity scales include the RCVS2 score, which assigns points for thunderclap headache, triggers, vasoconstriction, and normal CSF. Red flags include new focal deficits, seizures, or persistent fever (>38\u00b0C), suggesting complications such as ischemic stroke or hemorrhage. Without treatment, headache frequency peaks at 5\u201310 days and abates by 3 months in 95%, but 15% of untreated patients develop permanent deficits due to infarction or hemorrhage.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Noncontrast CT head within 6 hours \u2013 sensitivity 98% for SAH, to exclude hemorrhage. If negative, proceed to CT angiography (CTA) with thin-slice (0.5 mm) sequences to detect vasoconstriction; sensitivity 85%, specificity 90% for RCVS.\n\nStep 2: Lumbar puncture if CT is negative and suspicion remains \u2013 normal opening pressure (10\u201318 cm H2O), cell count <5 leukocytes/\u00b5L, protein <45 mg/dL, no xanthochromia by 12 hours.\n\nStep 3: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) \u2013 gold standard for multifocal segmental narrowing in anterior and posterior circulation; sensitivity 95% within 2 weeks of onset. Repeat DSA at 6\u201312 weeks confirms reversibility (>50% improvement in vessel caliber).\n\nSecond-line investigations: Brain MRI with FLAIR and DWI to detect cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (15% of RCVS) and small infarcts (5\u201310%). MRA may underestimate distal vasoconstriction.\n\nLaboratory workup: ESR, CRP normal; ANA, ANCA negative to rule out vasculitis; serum endothelial markers (endothelin-1) elevated by 30%.\n\nElectroencephalography is usually normal but can show diffuse slowing if seizures occur. Differential diagnoses include PACNS (elevated CSF protein), FMD (beading confined to carotid/renal arteries), aneurysmal SAH (positive CT LP), and cervical artery dissection (dissection flap on CTA).","management_principles":"First-line therapy consists of nimodipine 60 mg orally every 4 hours (max 360 mg/day) for 4\u201312 weeks, based on RCVS registry data showing 40% faster resolution. Alternatively, verapamil 80 mg TID may be used if hypotension limits nimodipine. Early administration within 48 hours reduces complications by 50%.\n\nSecond-line options include magnesium sulfate infusion at 1\u20132 g/hour IV for 48 hours in cases with severe vasospasm or cortical SAH. Third-line agents such as intravenous milrinone (0.75 \u00b5g/kg/min) have been used off-label for refractory vasoconstriction in 10% of cases.\n\nAvoidance of triggers is critical: discontinue SSRIs, triptans, sympathomimetics. Contraindications to calcium channel blockers include severe aortic stenosis and cardiogenic shock. Drug interactions: nimodipine is metabolized by CYP3A4\u2014avoid azole antifungals.\n\nNon-pharmacological measures: supportive care, hydration targeting central venous pressure of 8\u201312 mmHg. In rare refractory cases, intra-arterial balloon angioplasty or intra-arterial verapamil can be performed with a 75% immediate angiographic improvement rate, though risk of vessel dissection is 2\u20133%.\n\nMonitor blood pressure every 4 hours, aiming for SBP 120\u2013140 mmHg. Adjust dosages based on renal (CrCl <30 mL/min) or hepatic impairment, reducing nimodipine by 25% in severe dysfunction.","follow_up_guidelines":"Arrange outpatient neurology follow-up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks post-onset. At each visit, assess headache frequency, intensity (using a 0\u201310 scale), and neurological exam including NIH Stroke Scale. Repeat noninvasive vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) at 12 weeks to confirm vessel caliber normalization (>50% reversal of initial narrowing).\n\nLaboratory monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended at baseline and monthly if on high-dose nimodipine. Screen for long-term complications: small-vessel ischemic changes on MRI in 5% and persistent headaches in 10%. Prognosis is favorable: 1-year functional independence (mRS 0\u20131) in 90%, 5-year recurrence <5%.\n\nRehabilitation for any residual deficits (physio two sessions/week) should begin by week 4 if necessary. Educate patients on avoiding vasoactive drugs and recognizing thunderclap headache. Recommend driving restrictions until headache-free for 2 weeks. Provide resources such as the RCVS Foundation and American Headache Society for support and education.","clinical_pearls":"1. Thunderclap headache peaking within 1 minute is hallmark of RCVS vs. subacute PACNS.\n2. Reversible vasoconstriction confirmed by angiography reversal in 12 weeks.\n3.
