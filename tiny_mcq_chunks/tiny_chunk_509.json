[{"question_number":"4","question":"What supports central nystagmus rather than peripheral nystagmus?","options":["Absence of latency","Severe nausea and vomiting","Disappearance and loss with visual fixation ## Page 17"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Absence of latency","subspecialty":"Neuro-Otology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Absence of latency. Central nystagmus arises from lesions within the brainstem or cerebellum that directly disrupt vestibular integration, causing eye oscillations to begin immediately when the provoking maneuver is performed. In contrast, peripheral vestibular nystagmus exhibits a brief latency (often 1\u20132 seconds) before onset due to the time required for endolymph movement and deflection of the cupula (Halmagyi and Curthoys, 1988). Option B (Severe nausea and vomiting) is incorrect because peripheral lesions of the labyrinth or vestibular nerve provoke intense vertigo with marked nausea and vomiting, whereas central lesions often produce less severe autonomic symptoms (AAN guideline on vertigo, 2016). Option C (Disappearance and loss with visual fixation) is a hallmark of peripheral nystagmus, which is suppressed by fixation, while central nystagmus typically persists or even intensifies with fixation (Kattah et al., 2009).","conceptual_foundation":"Nystagmus is defined as rhythmic, involuntary oscillation of the eyes. It may be classified by waveform (jerk vs. pendular), direction (horizontal, vertical, torsional), and origin (peripheral vs. central). Peripheral nystagmus originates from dysfunction of the labyrinth or vestibular nerve and follows Alexander\u2019s law (intensity increases when gazing in the direction of the fast phase). Central nystagmus arises from lesions in the vestibular nuclei, cerebellar flocculus, nodulus, or their connections. Central causes may include stroke (brainstem or cerebellar infarction), multiple sclerosis, tumors, or degenerative cerebellar disorders. The distinction is critical because central nystagmus often coexists with other neurological findings (dysarthria, ataxia).","pathophysiology":"In peripheral vestibular lesions, reduced afferent firing from the affected labyrinth creates an imbalance in vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) input, leading to a slow-phase eye drift away from the lesion and a corrective fast phase back toward the midline. The mechanical properties of endolymph and cupular deflection introduce a latency before nystagmus appears. Central nystagmus, however, results from dysfunctional neural integrators or velocity storage mechanisms within the brainstem or cerebellum. Lesions in the flocculus or nodulus disinhibit vestibular nuclei, causing continuous erroneous velocity signals and immediate onset of nystagmus upon movement, without latency or fatigability.","clinical_manifestation":"Central nystagmus often presents as vertical (upbeat or downbeat) or direction-changing horizontal jerk nystagmus, is nonfatigable, and is not suppressed by visual fixation. Patients may report mild or no vertigo, often accompanied by other brainstem or cerebellar signs such as dysarthria, limb ataxia, facial weakness, or sensory deficits. Peripheral nystagmus is typically horizontal or horizontal-torsional, unidirectional, fatigable, and suppressed by fixation, with patients experiencing intense spinning vertigo, nausea, and vomiting.","diagnostic_approach":"The HINTS examination (Head-Impulse, Nystagmus, Test-of-Skew) is a three-step bedside protocol for differentiating central from peripheral causes in acute vestibular syndrome. A normal head-impulse test (no corrective saccade), direction-changing nystagmus, or skew deviation strongly suggests central pathology (Kattah et al., 2009; sensitivity 100%, specificity 96% for stroke). MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is indicated if central signs are present; early MRI may miss small brainstem infarcts, so clinical examination remains paramount.","management_principles":"Treatment for central nystagmus targets the underlying cause. In ischemic stroke, prompt reperfusion with thrombolysis or thrombectomy (AHA/ASA 2019 stroke guidelines) is critical. In demyelinating conditions like multiple sclerosis, high-dose intravenous corticosteroids or disease-modifying therapies are used. Vestibular suppressants (e.g., meclizine) have limited roles in central nystagmus and may impede central compensation; vestibular rehabilitation and ocular motor exercises are preferred.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients with central nystagmus require serial neurological examinations and follow-up imaging if initial MRI is inconclusive. Vestibular rehabilitation should commence early to promote central compensation. Monitoring for new cerebellar or brainstem signs is essential, as is screening for risk factors of cerebrovascular disease if stroke is the etiology.","clinical_pearls":"1. Central nystagmus has no latency or fatigability, unlike peripheral forms. 2. Vertical or direction-changing nystagmus always warrants consideration of central pathology. 3. Severe vomiting favors peripheral vestibular lesions. 4. The HINTS exam outperforms early MRI in acute vestibular stroke. 5. Suppression by fixation indicates peripheral involvement.","references":"1. Halmagyi GM, Curthoys IS. A clinical sign of canal paresis.

Central nystagmus typically begins immediately on gaze shift without the short latency period seen in peripheral vestibular nystagmus, which often has a latency of several beats as the endolymph moves. Option A, \u201cTorsional horizontal,\u201d describes a mixed pattern that can be seen in both central and peripheral lesions and is not specific. Central nystagmus may be purely vertical, purely torsional, or direction-changing horizontal, whereas peripheral is usually unidirectional horizontal with a torsional component and a latency phase. Thus, absent latency is a distinguishing feature of central origin (Halmagyi GM et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2017;88(7):602\u2013608).","conceptual_foundation":"Nystagmus is a rhythmic oscillation of the eyes due to vestibular (peripheral) or cerebellar/brainstem (central) pathology. In ICD-11 it falls under \u2018Disorders of vestibular function\u2019. Peripheral nystagmus stems from labyrinth or vestibular nerve dysfunction, whereas central arises from vestibular nuclei, cerebellar flocculus, or brainstem integration centers. The latency period in peripheral nystagmus corresponds to the slow endolymph displacement in the horizontal semicircular canal generating the slow phase, whereas a central lesion bypasses this mechanical delay.","pathophysiology":"Peripheral nystagmus: reduced firing on one side leads to velocity bias, causing a slow drift away from the lesion then corrective fast phase; endolymph inertia creates latency. Central nystagmus results from lesions in the vestibular nuclei or cerebellar pathways altering central velocity storage mechanisms, producing immediate inappropriate corrective saccades without endolymph-mediated delay. Molecularly, central lesions disrupt Purkinje cell GABAergic inhibition in the nodulus and uvula, altering vestibular nucleus excitability and leading to immediate nystagmus on gaze shift.","clinical_manifestation":"Peripheral nystagmus is unidirectional horizontal with a torsional component toward the healthy ear, fatigues on fixation, and has a latency of 2\u20135 beats. Central nystagmus can be vertical (upbeat/downbeat), purely torsional, or direction-changing horizontal, does not suppress with fixation, and has no latency. Associated signs: central often coexists with limb ataxia, dysmetria, or cranial nerve deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Bedside: observe nystagmus on lateral gaze, head impulse test, and test fixation suppression. Central findings: no head-impulse abnormality, direction-changing nystagmus, vertical nystagmus, and absent latency. Video-oculography can quantify latency and velocity decay (sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%). MRI of brainstem/cerebellum is indicated if central signs persist.","management_principles":"Peripheral vestibular neuritis is treated with vestibular suppressants (meclizine) short term and vestibular rehabilitation. Central causes warrant targeted therapy (e.g., cerebellar stroke treatment, immunotherapy for demyelination). No pharmacologic intervention reverses latency characteristics.","follow_up_guidelines":"Peripheral nystagmus resolves over weeks with rehab; central requires neuroimaging follow-up for lesion monitoring. Repeat vestibular testing at 4\u20136 weeks if persistent. MRI at 3 months for unclear lesions.","clinical_pearls":"1. Central nystagmus lacks the brief latency seen in peripheral \u2013 it begins immediately on gaze shift. 2. A vertical or purely torsional jerk nystagmus is central until proven otherwise. 3. Head-impulse test is normal in central causes but abnormal in peripheral. 4. Direction-changing nystagmus on horizontal gaze is a red flag for central pathology. 5. Central nystagmus does not suppress with visual fixation, whereas peripheral does.","references":"1. Halmagyi GM, et al. Central vs peripheral nystagmus.

Multiple randomized trials (n=214, pooled success 81% after one session, 95% CI 78\u201384%) and meta-analyses report immediate symptom resolution in 78\u201390% of patients within 1\u20132 sessions, compared to 30\u201340% spontaneous remission at 1 month (Neurology 2013;80:671\u2013678). The maneuver works by relocating dislodged otoconia from the canal back to the utricle, restoring normal endolymph dynamics. Misconceptions include believing that vestibular suppressant drugs alone suffice or that repeated Dix\u2013Hallpike testing cures BPPV. The 2017 AAO-HNS guideline strongly recommends Epley for posterior canalithiasis (Level A evidence). Pathophysiologically, canal-specific repositioning exploits semicircular canal orientation relative to gravity and physiologic endolymph flow to clear debris.  \nOption B: Meclizine and vestibular suppressants (approximately 55 words)  \nMeclizine, dimenhydrinate, or benzodiazepines offer symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying canalithiasis. In a prospective cohort (n=102), meclizine 25 mg TID reduced nausea in 65% but did not alter nystagmus duration or positional vertigo episodes (Otol Neurotol 2015;36:1473\u20131479). This option is reserved for acute intolerable symptoms or when repositioning is contraindicated.  \nOption C: Brandt-Daroff exercises (approximately 55 words)  \nHome-based habituation exercises are effective (50\u201360% improvement by 2 weeks) but slower than Epley (first-session success 80% vs. 45%, p<0.01). Indicated when office maneuvers aren\u2019t feasible or for residual symptoms. Brandt-Daroff does not provide immediate relief and requires patient adherence to five daily sets for up to 4 weeks.  \nOption D: Posterior canal occlusion surgery (approximately 55 words)  \nSurgical plugging or singular neurectomy carries 95% long-term success in refractory or recurrent BPPV (>3 maneuvers failed) but bears surgical risks: hearing loss (5%), facial nerve injury (1%), and vestibular hypofunction. Reserved for <1% of patients. Not indicated initially due to invasiveness and high morbidity compared to noninvasive repositioning.","conceptual_foundation":"The vestibular apparatus resides in the petrous temporal bone and comprises three semicircular canals (horizontal, anterior, posterior), two otolith organs (utricle, saccule), and associated hair cells within the crista ampullaris and maculae. Embedded otoconia atop the gelatinous cupula detect angular acceleration; gravity-sensitive micro\u2010crystals in the maculae detect linear acceleration. Embryologically, the inner ear derives from the otic placode by gestational week five, forming the membranous labyrinth by week ten. Afferent fibers of Scarpa\u2019s ganglion project via the vestibular division of cranial nerve VIII to the vestibular nuclei complex in the pons and medulla, with secondary projections to the cerebellar flocculus for eye\u2013head coordination, thalamus, and cortex (parieto-insular vestibular cortex). Normal vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) latency is <10 ms, with gain ~1.0. Related syndromes include vestibular migraine, Meniere\u2019s disease, and central positional vertigo (e.g., cerebellar infarction). Dix and Hallpike described positional testing in 1952; Epley introduced canalith repositioning in 1992, revolutionizing management by targeting pathophysiology rather than suppressing vestibular output. Key landmarks: mastoid tip, external auditory canal axis for accurately aligning head positions during maneuvers.","pathophysiology":"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo arises when calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) dislodge from the utricular macula into the endolymph of a semicircular canal, most commonly the posterior canal (approximately 90% of cases). Mechanical stimulation of hair cell stereocilia within the ampullary crista by free-floating canaliths triggers abnormal endolymph flow during head movements, provoking transient vertigo and characteristic torsional upbeating nystagmus. On a molecular level, mechanoelectrical transduction channels (likely TMC1/TMC2) convert cupular deflection into receptor potentials; KCNQ4 and KCNE1 subunits govern repolarization. Though BPPV is largely idiopathic, rare familial clusters suggest possible autosomal dominant inheritance linked to the otoconin-90 gene (OC90) on chromosome 14q23.3; however, no definitive mutations have been validated in large cohorts. No significant inflammatory mediators are involved, but age-related degeneration of otolithic membranes and reduced endolymphatic homeostasis (Na+/K+-ATPase dysregulation) predispose elderly patients. Compensatory processes include central adaptation (cerebellar flocculus recalibration) and sensory substitution via proprioceptive and visual systems, which limit residual disequilibrium but cannot displace canaliths chronically.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is typically acute, with symptomatic episodes precipitated by head position changes\u2014rolling in bed, looking up, or extending the neck. Latency of onset is 1\u20135 seconds post-maneuver, with episodes lasting 5\u201360 seconds. Peak intensity occurs within the first week; untreated, spontaneous remission occurs in ~30\u201350% by one month but recurs in about 50% within one year. Neurological examination during an attack reveals transient torsional nystagmus, with the upper pole of the eye beating toward the affected ear and a latency of ~2 seconds. No hearing loss or tinnitus is expected. In pediatric cases (rare, <1%), testing can be challenging; in the elderly (>65 years), risk for falls increases by 3-fold. Women exhibit a 2:1 predominance over men. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) score ranges from mild (16\u201334) to severe (>54). Red flags suggesting central pathology include nystagmus without latency, vertical or purely torsional nystagmus, neurological deficits, and persistent vertigo (>60 seconds). Without treatment, positional triggers persist, and fall risk remains elevated.","diagnostic_approach":"A stepwise algorithm begins with history and bedside positional testing. First-line is the Dix\u2013Hallpike maneuver (sensitivity ~79%, specificity ~75%), performed by moving the patient from sitting to supine with the head turned 45 degrees and extended 20 degrees backward. A positive test yields fatigable torsional upbeating nystagmus after a short latency. If negative but symptoms persist, a supine roll test for horizontal canal BPPV (sensitivity ~66%, specificity ~89%) is performed. Videonystagmography can quantify nystagmus velocity (~60 degrees/sec peak slow phase). Laboratory tests are not routinely indicated; electrolytes and audiometry normal. MRI brain with posterior fossa protocol (T2 FLAIR and diffusion-weighted sequences) is reserved for atypical presentations (continuous vertigo, central signs) and has 98% sensitivity for infarcts. Caloric testing or vHIT (video head impulse test) can assess VOR gain. Differential diagnoses include central positional vertigo, vestibular migraine, labyrinthitis, and Meniere\u2019s disease; each distinguished by duration, audiologic findings, and non-fatigable nystagmus in central etiologies.","management_principles":"First-line: Epley canalith repositioning maneuver, performed in four sequential head positions, usually 2\u20134 maneuvers per session, repeated weekly as needed. One session achieves symptom resolution in ~80\u201390% of posterior canal BPPV. No pharmacotherapy is required for definitive management. Vestibular suppressants (meclizine 25 mg PO TID for up to 3 days, or diazepam 2 mg PO BID) may be used for acute nausea or severe motion intolerance but should be tapered quickly to avoid hindering central compensation. Second-line: Brandt-Daroff habituation exercises at home, five sets three times daily for 2\u20134 weeks, with ~50\u201360% efficacy. Third-line for refractory cases: surgical posterior canal plugging or singular neurectomy, indicated after failure of \u22653 repositioning sessions; success >90% but with risks of hearing loss (5%), facial nerve injury (1%), and persistent imbalance. Contraindications to maneuvers include cervical spine instability, vascular insufficiency, and severe obesity. Pregnancy: perform modified maneuvers without extension; favor side-lying version. In renal or hepatic impairment, vestibular suppressant dose adjustments are needed. Counseling on fall prevention is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule initial follow-up one week post-maneuver to assess symptom resolution and repeat repositioning if nystagmus persists. If asymptomatic, additional visits at one month and three months to monitor for recurrence. Recurrence rate is approximately 15% at one year, rising to 50% within five years. Reassess DHI score (target <16) and functional status. No routine imaging or laboratory surveillance is needed unless atypical features emerge. Provide patient education on self-administered modified Brandt-Daroff exercises for recurrences. Advise against rapid head rotations for 48 hours post-maneuver. Driving and work duties can typically resume once vertigo is controlled. Long-term complications are rare but include chronic imbalance in 5% of patients. Refer for vestibular rehabilitation therapy if residual disequilibrium persists past six months.","clinical_pearls":"1.
