His wife mentioned that he told her he was seeing animals before deteriorating. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed left occipital hypodensity. What will you do?","options":["CTA","EEG"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"EEG","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B (EEG). The patient\u2019s visual phenomena (seeing animals) preceding decreased level of consciousness, in the setting of a left occipital hypodensity on CT, is most consistent with focal occipital seizures due to an ischemic infarct. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is the appropriate next study to document epileptiform activity. CTA (option A) would evaluate for large-vessel occlusion or aneurysm but is not indicated to confirm or exclude seizure activity. EEG is supported by epilepsy guidelines (Level B evidence) for new-onset focal seizures following acute stroke.","conceptual_foundation":"Focal seizures arise from an area of hyperexcitable cortex; occipital lobe involvement produces visual hallucinations (elementary or complex). The threshold for seizure is lowered in ischemic brain tissue. EEG records synchronous neuronal discharges as spikes, sharp waves, or rhythmic activity. Standard scalp EEG remains the first-line modality for detection of ictal or interictal activity.","pathophysiology":"Ischemic injury in the occipital cortex disrupts ionic homeostasis and neurotransmitter balance, leading to excessive glutamate release, NMDA receptor activation, and paroxysmal depolarizing shifts. These changes produce focal epileptiform discharges that manifest as visual symptoms.","clinical_manifestation":"Occipital lobe seizures present with visual phenomena\u2014flashing lights, formed images (e.g., animals), or visual distortions\u2014often without loss of awareness initially. Secondary generalization can lead to impaired consciousness.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (already done). Next: EEG to identify epileptiform discharges. MRI may follow to characterize the infarct. CTS angiography is reserved for vascular evaluation if endovascular therapy is under consideration.","management_principles":"Acute management of post-stroke seizures includes benzodiazepines for status epilepticus and initiation of anti-seizure medication (e.g., levetiracetam, Level A evidence). Long-term prophylaxis is considered if recurrent seizures occur.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat EEG may be obtained if clinical seizures persist. Neuroimaging (MRI) at 3\u20136 months to assess infarct evolution. Monitor for recurrence and adjust anti-seizure drug dosing based on renal function.","clinical_pearls":"1. Formed visual hallucinations in stroke suggest occipital seizure. 2. CT hypodensity is ischemia, not hemorrhage; EEG distinguishes seizure. 3. Early post-stroke seizures (<7 days) occur in ~5\u201310% of cases. 4. Levetiracetam is preferred in ESRD due to easy renal dosing. 5. CTA is not diagnostic for seizure.","references":"1.

The CADISS randomized trial (Lancet Neurol. 2015) demonstrated no significant difference in stroke recurrence between antiplatelet and anticoagulation arms. Current AHA/ASA guidelines (2011, updated 2018) recommend antithrombotic therapy for 3\u20136 months (Class I, Level A). No endovascular or surgical intervention is routinely indicated unless there is recurrent ischemia despite optimal medical management.","conceptual_foundation":"Cervical artery dissection involves a tear in the intima allowing blood into the vessel wall, forming an intramural hematoma. It accounts for ~20% of strokes in patients <45 years. ICD-11 classifies CAD under ischemic cerebrovascular disorders. Risk factors include trauma, hypertension, connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan), and FMD. Embryologically, cervical arteries derive from neural crest cells; structural connective tissue abnormalities can predispose to dissection.","pathophysiology":"Intimal tear leads to intramural hematoma, which can narrow the lumen (stenotic subtype) or form a pseudoaneurysm (aneurysmal subtype). Vessel wall stress causes thrombus formation, with risk of distal embolization leading to ischemic stroke. The hematoma may resolve via reabsorption or endothelial remodeling over weeks to months.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present with acute-onset neck pain or headache in 70\u201390%, followed by focal neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemisensory loss) due to thromboembolism. Horner\u2019s syndrome occurs in ~8% when sympathetic fibers in the carotid sheath are involved. Transient ischemic attacks may precede stroke. Natural history is favorable: ~75% heal spontaneously by 3\u20136 months.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: CTA or MRA with fat-suppressed sequences; sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95%. Doppler ultrasound less sensitive, especially in intracranial segments. Second-tier: Digital subtraction angiography reserved for equivocal cases or endovascular planning. Pre-test probability is driven by age <50, acute neck pain, and focal deficits.","management_principles":"Initiate antithrombotic therapy promptly. Aspirin 75\u2013325 mg daily or clopidogrel if ASA-intolerant. Anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin, INR 2\u20133) may be used based on physician preference. Thrombolysis is indicated if acute ischemic stroke criteria are met. Endovascular stenting for pseudoaneurysm causing mass effect or recurrent embolism despite medical therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat vascular imaging at 3\u20136 months to assess vessel healing. If dissection persists, continue antithrombotics and re-image at 12 months. Long-term secondary prevention with antiplatelet therapy and control of hypertension risk factors.","clinical_pearls":"1. CAD is a leading cause of stroke in young adults. 2. Head/neck pain preceding stroke is a red flag. 3. CTA/MRA are noninvasive diagnostic modalities of choice. 4.

Risk factors include hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia, and coagulopathies. Differential diagnoses encompass aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome.","pathophysiology":"Spontaneous bleeding into the brain parenchyma leads to mass effect, elevated intracranial pressure, perihematomal edema, and secondary ischemic injury.

Nucleus ambiguus involvement leads to uvula deviation away from the side of lesion; leftward deviation indicates a right\u2010sided lesion. Therefore, right ptosis is expected.","conceptual_foundation":"Lateral medullary infarction is a dorsolateral brainstem stroke in the PICA territory. ICD-11 classifies this among ischemic cerebrovascular disorders. Key structures affected include the spinal trigeminal nucleus (ipsilateral facial pain/temp loss), spinothalamic tract (contralateral body pain/temp loss), nucleus ambiguus (dysphagia, hoarseness), vestibular nuclei (nystagmus), and descending sympathetics (Horner's syndrome).","pathophysiology":"Occlusion of PICA leads to ischemia in the lateral medullary region. Loss of sympathetics causes miosis and ptosis. Infarction of nucleus ambiguus fibers impairs vagal innervation of the palate, leading to ipsilateral palate droop and contralateral uvula deviation. Disruption of spinothalamic tracts yields contralateral analgesia.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic Wallenberg features include ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss, contralateral body pain/temp loss, dysphagia, hoarseness, diminished gag reflex, vertigo, nystagmus, ipsilateral ataxia, and ipsilateral Horner\u2019s. Uvula deviation away from the lesion is pathognomonic of nucleus ambiguus involvement.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging is the modality of choice, showing hyperintensity in the lateral medulla. MRA/CTA assess vertebral/PICA patency. CT may be unrevealing early. Clinical exam is critical for syndromic localization.","management_principles":"Acute management follows ischemic stroke guidelines: IV alteplase if within window and no contraindications. After stabilization, secondary prevention with antiplatelets (aspirin, clopidogrel), statins, and blood pressure control. Dysphagia managed with swallow evaluation and possible feeding tube placement.","follow_up_guidelines":"Swallowing function reassessed before oral intake. Outpatient rehab for dysphagia and ataxia.

ICD-11 classifies SAH under BA40; disturbances of sodium under NE6Z. Distinguishing volume status is critical.","pathophysiology":"In SIADH, central nervous system irritation leads to nonosmotic ADH release, water retention, and dilutional hyponatremia. In CSW, brain natriuretic peptide release and sympathetic derangement cause renal sodium loss and hypovolemia.","clinical_manifestation":"Both present with hyponatremia (serum Na <135 mEq/L), but SIADH shows euvolemia, low serum osmolality, high urine osmolality, and high urine sodium.
