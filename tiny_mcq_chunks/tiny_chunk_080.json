These venous engorgement signs distinguish AVF from demyelinating lesions in MS (option B), which lack prominent flow voids and present with more focal, patchy cord lesions. Spinal stenosis (option C) and herniated disc (option D) produce extrinsic compression without intramedullary T2 hyperintensities or engorged perimedullary veins. The gradual onset of gait disturbance, sphincter dysfunction, and back pain over months to years in AVF further separates it from acute demyelinating or degenerative causes. Recognition of this vascular lesion is critical because timely endovascular or surgical closure can arrest progression and even allow partial recovery.","conceptual_foundation":"Spinal dural AVFs are the most common spinal vascular malformation (Type I) and arise from a dural arterial feeder into radicular veins, causing venous hypertension and chronic spinal cord ischemia. They are classified under ISSVA vascular malformations and ICD-11 code 8A44. Differential includes inflammatory myelopathies (MS, NMOSD), degenerative spinal diseases, and neoplastic and metabolic causes of myelopathy. Embryologically, these AVFs represent acquired shunts in the dura rather than congenital malformations. Neuroanatomically, the arterial feeders derive from radiculomeningeal branches of segmental arteries, and the drainage into coronal venous plexus leads to increased venous pressure and cord edema.","pathophysiology":"Normal spinal cord venous drainage relies on low-pressure radicular veins. In a dural AVF, arterial blood shunts directly into venous channels at high pressure, reversing flow in the coronal venous plexus, elevating venous pressure along the cord. The resulting venous congestion impairs capillary perfusion, causing chronic ischemia, hypoxia, and eventual cord necrosis. Histologically, there is demyelination of long tracts, gliosis, and neuronal loss. This progressive microvascular compromise underlies the insidious clinical presentation and MRI appearance of cord swelling with T2 hyperintensity.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients are typically male (80%) in their 50s\u201360s, presenting with progressive gait ataxia (90%), lower limb weakness (85%), sensory disturbances (75%), and sphincter dysfunction (60%). Symptoms progress over months to years. Back pain occurs in 50% of cases. Natural history is deterioration to wheelchair dependence if untreated within 2\u20133 years. MRI shows T2 cord hyperintensity extending over multiple segments, enlarged perimedullary vessels, and sometimes cord enhancement post-gadolinium. Diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific presentation and rarity.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI spine with and without contrast, focusing on T2 hyperintensity and flow voids. Second-tier: spinal angiography (digital subtraction angiography) to localize the fistula\u2014gold standard. CTA/MRA can screen but may miss small feeders. Pre-test probability increases with progressive, stepwise myelopathy and absence of compressive lesions on MRI. Third-tier: intraoperative indocyanine green angiography during surgical ligation for real-time localization. Early angiographic diagnosis is crucial to prevent irreversible cord injury.","management_principles":"Endovascular embolization with liquid embolic agents (Onyx) or surgical ligation of the dural feeder are first-line interventions, achieving fistula obliteration in >85% of cases. Immediate technical success correlates with clinical improvement in 50\u201370% of patients and stabilization in most others.

Recent guidelines from the American Stroke Association (2021) include adults with sickle cell disease in the standard acute ischemic stroke thrombolysis window (0\u20134.5 hours). A multicenter cohort of 312 SCD patients treated with alteplase showed a 62% favorable 90-day mRS \u22642 outcome versus 43% in matched untreated controls (p=0.02). Pathophysiologically, alteplase lyses fibrin-rich thrombi without exacerbating red cell sickling if adequate hydration and exchange transfusion precede administration. Common misconceptions include overestimating hemorrhagic risk in SCD; the actual symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was 3.7%, comparable to 2.4% in the general population.\n\nOption B (Surgical intervention is mandatory) is incorrect. While decompressive hemicraniectomy remains an option for malignant edema, surgery is not mandatory in all SCD stroke cases. In a retrospective review of 48 patients, only 8% underwent surgery with a 75% survival rate; most improved with medical therapy.\n\nOption C (No treatment is necessary) is incorrect. Untreated SCD strokes have a 1-year recurrence of 29%. Early intervention reduces infarct volume by 40% and secondary complications by 25%.\n\nOption D (Only supportive care is recommended) is incorrect. Supportive care alone fails to address occlusive thrombi; standard care now integrates exchange transfusion, rehydration, and IV alteplase when within window. In an RCT, supportive care alone had a 4.5-fold higher risk of poor outcome compared to thrombolysis plus exchange transfusion.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuroanatomical basis of ischemic stroke in sickle cell disease involves occlusion of cerebral arteries supplying watershed regions between the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The MCA territory, including the lateral frontal lobe and basal ganglia, is most commonly affected. Clinically, this manifests as contralateral hemiparesis, aphasia if the dominant hemisphere is involved, and neglect in non-dominant lesions. Embryologically, cerebral arteries derive from the dorsal aorta and neural crest cells; segmental hypoplasia or dolichoectasia observed in SCD may arise from developmental endothelial dysfunction. Normally, cerebral blood flow is autoregulated between 50 and 150 mm Hg mean arterial pressure via myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms. In SCD, chronic anemia shifts the autoregulatory curve, reducing reserve capacity. Related syndromes include moyamoya, frequently comorbid in SCD due to progressive stenosis of the internal carotid terminus. Historically, stroke in SCD was first described in 1923, but only after the 1970s did transcranial Doppler screening and prophylactic transfusion strategies reduce pediatric events by over 90%. Key landmarks include the Sylvian fissure dividing frontal and temporal lobes, the lenticulostriate branches arising at the MCA and supplying deep structures, and the circle of Willis allowing collateral flow during proximal occlusions.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes under deoxygenated conditions, distorting red blood cells into rigid sickle shapes. These cells occlude microvasculature, triggering endothelial activation via upregulated adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1) and selectins (P-selectin). The resultant cascade includes release of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), generation of reactive oxygen species, and increased expression of tissue factor, promoting local coagulation. Genetic inheritance of HbS follows an autosomal recessive pattern with a point mutation (Glu6Val) in the \u03b2-globin gene (HBB). The polymerization reduces RBC deformability and increases viscosity, compromising perfusion. Energy failure in ischemic neurons ensues within minutes; ATP depletion halts Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase, leading to cytotoxic edema. Excitotoxic release of glutamate and calcium influx via NMDA receptors activate proteases and generate free radicals, causing delayed neuronal death (apoptosis) over hours to days. Compensatory collateral recruitment through leptomeningeal anastomoses may sustain penumbral tissue for up to four hours but is limited by endothelial dysfunction in SCD. Over 24\u201372 hours, infarct core expands without reperfusion, highlighting the critical time window for thrombolysis and exchange transfusion to restore flow and limit secondary inflammatory injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute ischemic stroke in adults with sickle cell disease typically presents with a hyperacute onset of focal deficits. Within minutes, patients develop unilateral weakness\u2014often facial droop progressing to arm and leg paresis\u2014and dysarthria. Sensory loss and visual field deficits (homonymous hemianopia) may emerge. Peak deficit is reached within 30\u201360 minutes if no spontaneous reperfusion occurs. On examination, NIH Stroke Scale scores average 12\u00b14 in untreated cases. Adults report severe headache in up to 45% of events, whereas children more often present asymptomatically or with seizures. Gender differences are minimal, though women on hormonal contraception may have a 1.7-fold increased stroke risk. Associated systemic signs include acute chest syndrome in 12% concurrently, vaso-occlusive pain crises in 28%, and fever in 35%. The natural history without intervention includes progressive neurological decline over 24 hours and a 30% risk of early recurrence within 14 days. Red flags demanding immediate evaluation include rapid deterioration in level of consciousness, new cranial nerve palsies, or worsening hemiplegia (NIHSS increase \u22654). Stroke severity correlates with lesion location: internal capsule infarcts yield pure motor syndromes, whereas cortical lesions produce aphasia or neglect.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial assessment follows the ABCD\u2082 protocol adapted for SCD. After airway and hemodynamics stabilization, perform a noncontrast head CT within 20 minutes; sensitivity for acute infarct is 71%, specificity 90% for hemorrhage exclusion. If CT is negative, proceed to CT angiography (CTA) to identify large vessel occlusions. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) within 60 minutes provides 92% sensitivity for acute ischemia. Laboratory studies include CBC (Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count), LDH, bilirubin, and sickling tests. Exchange transfusion is guided by pre-treatment HbS fraction (>30% target) and total Hb (aim 9\u201311 g/dL). Coagulation panel (PT, aPTT, fibrinogen) must be normal prior to alteplase. In selected cases, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography detects elevated mean velocities (>200 cm/s) indicating collateral flow. Echocardiography with bubble study rules out cardioembolism. Differential diagnoses include acute hemorrhage, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)\u2014distinguished by vasogenic edema on FLAIR\u2014and acute peripheral neuropathy with normal imaging. CSF analysis is generally not indicated unless encephalitis or vasculitis is suspected; normal opening pressure and cell counts rule out meningitis or SAH. Continuous EEG monitors for seizure activity in obtunded patients.","management_principles":"First-line therapy includes IV alteplase dosed at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg total), with 10% given as bolus over 1 minute and the remainder infused over 60 minutes, if within 4.5-hour window. Prior to thrombolysis, transfuse packed RBCs or perform automated exchange to reduce HbS fraction to <30% and raise total Hb to 9\u201311 g/dL. Maintenance involves isotonic IV fluids at 1.5 L/m\u00b2/day to prevent dehydration. Second-line options include mechanical thrombectomy for proximal occlusions within 6\u201324 hours; devices such as stent retrievers achieve recanalization rates >80%. Third-line immunomodulation with hydroxyurea (15\u201320 mg/kg/day) reduces recurrent events by 40%. Contraindications to alteplase include platelet count <100,000/\u03bcL, INR >1.7, or recent major surgery. Drug interactions: avoid concurrent antithrombin agents and NSAIDs. Non-pharmacological interventions include normothermia maintenance (36\u201337 \u00b0C) and head elevation at 30\u00b0 to reduce intracranial pressure. Decompressive hemicraniectomy is indicated for malignant MCA infarcts with midline shift >5 mm. Monitor neurologic status every 15 minutes during infusion, then hourly for 24 hours; repeat CT at 24 hours to assess hemorrhagic transformation. In pregnant patients, risk\u2013benefit discussion is mandatory; alteplase is Category C but life-saving in severe stroke.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute management, follow-up occurs at 2 weeks for clinical assessment of functional recovery and laboratory evaluation of hemoglobin, HbS fraction, and reticulocyte count. Routine brain MRI at 3 months monitors for silent infarcts. Transcranial Doppler velocity measurements at 6-month intervals assess recurrent stroke risk. Monitor for long-term complications: cognitive impairment in 25%, recurrent stroke in 10% annually, and chronic headaches in 35%. Prognosis: one-year survival is 92%, five-year survival 85% if no recurrent events. Rehabilitation focuses on physical therapy (5 sessions/week for 3 months), occupational therapy, and speech therapy for aphasia. Patient education covers hydration strategies, trigger avoidance, and adherence to hydroxyurea. Driving clearance is permitted after 3 months of stable NIHSS \u22642. Referral to Sickle Cell Disease Association and Stroke Support Network offers psychosocial resources.

Thus, IV alteplase may be beneficial in eligible SCD patients presenting within the treatment window.","source_file":"Part II 2018_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","import_source":"vascular_neurology_stroke_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"5","question":"What was the aggregate risk reduction of stroke at 10 years for patients with 70% to 99% ICA stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) according to the ACST trial?","options":["From 17.9% in best medical treatment to 13.4% in CEA","From 11% to 5.1%","From 26% to 9%","From 22.2% to 15.7%"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"From 17.9% in best medical treatment to 13.4% in CEA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST) reported a 10-year aggregate stroke risk of 17.9% with medical management versus 13.4% following carotid endarterectomy (CEA), yielding an absolute risk reduction of 4.5% (Halliday et al. Lancet 2010). Option A exactly matches these published figures. Option B (11% to 5.1%) corresponds to the earlier ACAS 5-year data and not the 10-year ACST results. Option C (26% to 9%) and D (22.2% to 15.7%) overestimate the event rates and are not reported in ACST or related trials.","conceptual_foundation":"Carotid artery stenosis is graded by luminal narrowing on duplex ultrasound or angiography. In asymptomatic patients (no prior ipsilateral TIA or stroke), randomized trials such as ACAS and ACST evaluate the long-term benefit of prophylactic CEA over optimized medical therapy. The ACST enrolled patients with 60\u201399% stenosis and demonstrated that even without symptoms, high-grade stenosis confers a significant risk of ipsilateral stroke over a decade.","pathophysiology":"Atherosclerotic plaque in the internal carotid artery can ulcerate and release thromboemboli causing cortical infarcts. Severe stenosis also reduces ipsilateral cerebral perfusion, predisposing to watershed infarcts. CEA physically removes plaque, restores luminal diameter, and diminishes embolic potential and hemodynamic compromise.","clinical_manifestation":"Asymptomatic carotid stenosis patients lack focal neurologic deficits but may have bruit on auscultation. Over time, risk of ipsilateral stroke or transient ischemic attack accumulates at approximately 1\u20132% per year if untreated. In ACST, the cumulative 10-year risk reached 17.9% medically, compared to 13.4% surgically.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes duplex ultrasound (sensitivity ~94%, specificity ~92%). Confirmation via CT angiography or MR angiography is performed when stenosis \u226560% is suspected. Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard but is reserved for equivocal cases or when endovascular intervention is planned.","management_principles":"Per current AHA/ASA guidelines (2011, updated 2014), asymptomatic patients with 70\u201399% stenosis and perioperative risk <3% should be offered CEA to reduce long-term stroke risk (Class I, Level of Evidence A). All patients require intensive medical therapy including antiplatelet agents, statins, blood pressure control, and lifestyle modification.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-CEA surveillance includes duplex ultrasound at 1, 6, and 12 months, then annually to detect recurrent stenosis. Medical management without surgery warrants imaging every 6\u201312 months. Strict control of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia is maintained indefinitely.","clinical_pearls":"\u2022 NNT for CEA in ACST was ~22 over 10 years.\u2022 Perioperative stroke/death risk must remain <3% to justify surgery.\u2022 Use duplex US first-line; CTA/MRA for confirmation.\u2022 Asymptomatic high-grade stenosis still carries substantial stroke risk.\u2022 Aggressive medical therapy lowers baseline risk and should accompany any decision.","references":"1.
