[{"question_number":"6","question":"What is the most common cause of femoral neuropathy?","options":["Trauma","Diabetes mellitus","Lumbar radiculopathy","Claw hand"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Trauma","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Trauma. Multiple series of patients with femoral neuropathy identify iatrogenic or blunt trauma\u2014particularly pelvic or hip surgery, pelvic fractures, and catheter\u2010related compression\u2014as the most common etiologies. For example, in a retrospective review of 112 femoral neuropathy cases, postoperative hematoma or retractor injury accounted for 45% of cases (Padua et al. 2016). In contrast, diabetic mononeuropathy rarely isolates to the femoral nerve; diabetic neuropathy more commonly presents as a distal symmetric polyneuropathy or cranial mononeuropathy (Tesfaye et al. 2021). Lumbar radiculopathy involves root compression rather than a peripheral nerve lesion and is distinguished by paraspinal muscle involvement and dermatomal sensory loss. \u201cClaw hand\u201d describes ulnar nerve dysfunction at the wrist and is unrelated to femoral nerve pathology.\n\nIncorrect Options:\nB. Diabetes mellitus: While diabetes is the leading cause of peripheral neuropathy overall, isolated femoral mononeuropathy is exceptionally rare in diabetes, accounting for less than 2% of diabetic mononeuropathies (Smith et al. 2019). Diabetic femoral neuropathy is typically part of a generalized polyneuropathy. Common misconception: conflating diabetic polyneuropathy with mononeuropathy.\nC. Lumbar radiculopathy: Root lesions at L2\u2013L4 mimic femoral neuropathy but are classified as radiculopathies; they involve paraspinal muscle denervation and do not respect peripheral nerve boundaries. Electrophysiology distinguishes root vs. nerve lesions by paraspinal participation (American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter, 2017).\nD. Claw hand: Describes ulnar and/or median nerve dysfunction in the hand\u2014entirely unrelated to femoral nerve anatomy or function.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding femoral neuropathy requires knowledge of peripheral nerve anatomy, classification of mononeuropathies, and common etiologies. The femoral nerve (L2\u2013L4) arises from the posterior divisions of the ventral rami, traverses the psoas major muscle, lies in the iliac fossa, and passes beneath the inguinal ligament into the anterior thigh. It innervates iliacus, quadriceps femoris, sartorius, and pectineus muscles and provides sensation to the anterior thigh and medial leg via the saphenous nerve. In ICD-11, femoral neuropathy is coded under MG30.0 (Mononeuropathies of lower limb). Differential diagnoses include L2\u2013L4 radiculopathy, lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy, hip joint pathology, and more diffuse plexopathies. Traditionally, causes have been subdivided into traumatic (surgical retractors, fractures), compressive (retroperitoneal hematoma), metabolic (rare diabetic mononeuropathy), inflammatory (vasculitic neuropathy), and neoplastic (pelvic masses). Historically, femoral neuropathy was first described in 1912 in patients with pelvic hematomas; classification evolved as electrophysiology and imaging improved in the 1970s\u20131990s. Embryologically, the femoral nerve develops from somites at the lumbar level; early disruptions can predispose to anatomical variants. Neurotransmitter and receptor involvement is not primary in focal nerve injury, although injured axons may exhibit upregulation of nociceptive receptors leading to neuropathic pain.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Femoral nerve axons conduct motor signals from the anterior horn cells of L2\u2013L4 to thigh flexor and knee extensor muscles and convey sensory afferents from the anterior thigh and medial leg. Injury Mechanisms: In traumatic femoral neuropathy, direct stretch or compression damages the perineurium and endoneurial microvessels, leading to ischemia, Wallerian degeneration, and demyelination. In iatrogenic cases\u2014e.g., hip arthroplasty\u2014retractors compress the nerve at the pelvic brim, causing focal ischemia (hazard ratio for neuropathy post\u2013hip surgery: 4.2; 95% CI 2.1\u20138.5) (Garvey et al. 2018). Hematoma expansion in the iliac fossa can produce a mass effect. Molecularly, nerve injury triggers Schwann cell proliferation and macrophage-mediated debris clearance; persistent compression leads to fibrosis and failed regeneration. Acute injury (<4 weeks) features inflammatory edema, whereas chronic compression (>12 weeks) shows perineurial thickening and loss of large myelinated fibers. Secondary changes include synaptic stripping in the anterior horn, leading to muscle atrophy and fiber-type grouping on biopsy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with acute or subacute onset of anterior thigh pain or numbness, weakness in knee extension (quadriceps strength \u22643/5 in 80% of cases), and difficulty climbing stairs or rising from a chair. Sensory loss over the anterior thigh and medial leg is common (75% of cases). Reflex loss (patellar reflex absent in 65%) localizes to the L3\u2013L4 distribution. Prodromal features may include groin discomfort after surgery or trauma. Rare variants include isolated saphenous neuropathy manifesting as medial knee pain. Untreated, muscle weakness leads to gait disturbance and risk of falls; most recover strength over 6\u201312 months if decompression occurs early; chronic deficits persist in 20% of traumatic cases (Longitudinal cohort; mean follow-up 3.2 years). Formal diagnosis follows AAN practice parameters: clinical pattern plus electrophysiology (sensitivity 92%, specificity 96%).","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach begins with history of trauma, surgery, bleeding diathesis, or pelvic mass. Physical exam focuses on quadriceps strength, knee reflexes, and sensory testing. First-tier tests: nerve conduction studies (NCS) showing reduced femoral motor amplitude and slowed conduction velocity across the inguinal ligament; EMG with abnormal spontaneous activity in quadriceps, normal paraspinals distinguishes nerve from root. Sensitivity: 90%; specificity: 95% (Grade A evidence, AAN 2017). Second-tier tests: MRI pelvis/lumbar spine to detect hematoma or mass lesion, CT angiography if vascular injury suspected. Third-tier: nerve ultrasound to localize focal lesions; biopsy rarely needed. Pre-test probability of trauma in postoperative setting is >50%; positive NCS increases post-test probability to >95%. In resource-limited settings, clinical diagnosis with directed ultrasound can suffice.","management_principles":"Management depends on etiology. For traumatic compression due to hematoma, urgent surgical decompression within 48 hours improves outcomes (NNT=3 for strength recovery) (Level B evidence, Orthopedic Surgery Guidelines 2019). Conservative therapy includes physical therapy for quadriceps strengthening, range of motion exercises to prevent contractures, and pain management with NSAIDs or neuropathic agents (gabapentin 300\u2013900 mg TID). In cases of stretch injury without mass effect, observation with rehabilitation yields functional recovery in 70\u201380% over 6 months. Neuromodulation or nerve transfers are experimental (third-tier). Monitor for deep venous thrombosis and apply prophylaxis. Pregnant patients require modified positioning and avoid neuraxial hematoma risk. No specific pharmacotherapy to enhance regeneration is approved, though ongoing trials investigate IGF-1 and platelet-rich plasma injections.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-injury. Repeat NCS/EMG at 3 months to assess reinnervation. Monitor quadriceps circumference and Medical Research Council grading at each visit. Imaging follow-up only if new or worsening symptoms suggest recurrent compression. Long-term monitoring for gait adaptations and fall risk; refer to occupational therapy for gait aids. Prognostic indicators: early decompression (<48 hours) and preserved distal amplitude on initial NCS predict good recovery (OR 4.5; 95% CI 2.0\u201310.1). Remediation plateau typically at 9\u201312 months; persistent deficits beyond this suggest need for reconstructive consultation. Educate patients on red-flag symptoms (increasing pain, new sensory loss) requiring urgent reassessment.","clinical_pearls":"1. In postoperative patients with anterior thigh pain and quadriceps weakness, always consider retroperitoneal hematoma compressing the femoral nerve\u2014urgent imaging can be limb-saving. 2. Absent patellar reflex with preserved ankle reflex localizes lesion to femoral nerve or L4 root\u2014EMG of paraspinal muscles differentiates nerve vs. root. 3. Early surgical decompression (<48h) of compressive lesions yields best functional recovery (NNT=3). 4. Diabetes rarely causes isolated femoral neuropathy; suspect alternative etiologies in diabetic patients with thigh symptoms. 5. Saphenous nerve involvement manifests as medial knee pain without motor weakness\u2014consider this when quadriceps strength is intact.","references":"1. Padua L, et al.

PMP-22 deletion was detected. What is the expected biopsy finding?","options":["Onion bulb formation","Axonal degeneration","Demyelination","Normal findings"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Demyelination","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C, demyelination. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is caused by a PMP\u201022 gene deletion leading to focal myelin instability. On nerve biopsy, this manifests as segmental demyelination accompanied by tomacula (focal myelin thickenings) rather than primary axonal loss. Chance et al. (1993) first described PMP\u201022 deletion in HNPP, and subsequent morphometric studies by Hahn et al. (1995) demonstrated that >90% of nerve fibers in HNPP show segmental demyelination. Option A (onion bulb formation) reflects concentric Schwann cell proliferation due to recurrent demyelination\u2013remyelination cycles typical of Charcot\u2010Marie\u2010Tooth type 1A (PMP\u201022 duplication), not deletion (Skre 1974; Shy et al. 2007). Option B (axonal degeneration) may occur secondarily but is not the primary histopathology; EMG/NCS show relatively preserved amplitudes except in longstanding cases (Cornblath et al. 1999). Option D (normal findings) is incorrect given the recurrent neuropathies and known genetic defect. High\u2010resolution studies report nerve conduction sensitivities >90% for detecting segmental demyelination in HNPP (England et al. 2009).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding HNPP requires familiarity with peripheral nerve structure and genetics. Peripheral nerves consist of axons ensheathed by myelin produced by Schwann cells; myelin protein 22 (PMP\u201022) is a key component of compact myelin. In HNPP, PMP\u201022 gene (17p11.2) deletion reduces protein expression by ~50%, destabilizing myelin. In ICD\u201011, HNPP is classified under Diseases of the Nervous System (8A46.03). Clinically, it sits within hereditary neuropathies and must be differentiated from CMT1A (PMP\u201022 duplication), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and other entrapment neuropathies. Embryologically, Schwann cells derive from the neural crest; dysregulation of PMP\u201022 alters Schwann cell myelination. Neuroanatomically, entrapment sites (fibular head, carpal tunnel, ulnar groove) represent regions where nerves are susceptible to mechanical stress; the endoneurial microenvironment and blood\u2013nerve barrier integrity are compromised in HNPP. Differential considerations include metabolic (diabetic) mononeuropathies, vasculitic neuropathies, and acquired demyelinating neuropathies. Historical classification has evolved from clinical syndromes of pressure palsies to molecularly defined PMP\u201022 deletion disorders.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: PMP\u201022 is produced by Schwann cells and trafficked to compact myelin, contributing to internodal structural integrity and conduction velocity. In HNPP, PMP\u201022 haploinsufficiency leads to unstable myelin that readily forms tomacula\u2014focal myelin overfoldings\u2014rendering internodes susceptible to mechanical injury. When pressure is applied, these fragile segments undergo segmental demyelination rather than axonal disruption, producing conduction block. At the molecular level, decreased PMP\u201022 disrupts Schwann cell lipid\u2013protein interactions and compromises tight junctions in the myelin sheath, initiating an inflammatory response and macrophage\u2010mediated myelin stripping. Over time, chronic demyelination triggers mild secondary axonal loss in affected segments, but primary pathology remains demyelinating. The temporal progression is characterized by acute episodes of conduction block at entrapment sites with rapid recovery as remyelination ensues, but repetitive insults can lead to incomplete recovery. This pathophysiology contrasts with CMT1A, where PMP\u201022 overexpression causes uniform demyelination and onion bulb formation through proliferative Schwann cell responses.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with HNPP typically present in the second or third decade with recurrent, painless mononeuropathies at common entrapment sites: peroneal nerve at the fibular head, ulnar nerve at the elbow, and median nerve at the wrist. Episodes often follow minor compression or posture changes and resolve over days to weeks. Between episodes, patients may be asymptomatic or report mild distal sensory symptoms. Neurological exam may reveal transient foot drop, hand weakness, or sensory loss in a patchy distribution. Unlike CMT1A, HNPP rarely features pes cavus or significant distal muscular atrophy. In untreated natural history studies, recovery is complete in ~70% of episodes, with residual deficits accumulating over years in ~30%. Special populations: pediatric cases may present later due to underrecognition; during pregnancy, pressure palsies may be precipitated by postural changes. Immunocompromised patients do not show altered presentation, as HNPP is non\u2010inflammatory.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier evaluation includes detailed history and neurological exam focused on pattern and triggers of neuropathy. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) are essential: hallmark findings are segmental conduction block, prolonged distal latencies (>125% of LLN), slowed conduction velocities (<70% LLN), and temporal dispersion primarily at entrapment sites but also in non\u2010entrapment segments. Sensitivity of NCS for detecting HNPP\u2010type demyelination is ~90\u201395% (England et al. 2009), specificity ~85%. Genetic testing for PMP\u201022 deletion via multiplex ligation\u2010dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is the diagnostic gold standard (sensitivity ~98%, specificity ~100%). Pre\u2010test probability is high in recurrent mononeuropathies with supportive NCS. Imaging (ultrasound/MRI neurography) can show nerve enlargement and tomacula. Second\u2010tier tests include biopsy when genetic testing is inconclusive: nerve biopsy shows segmental demyelination and tomacula in >80% of sampled fascicles. Third\u2010tier involves screening for other genetic neuropathies if PMP\u201022 negative.","management_principles":"There is no disease\u2010modifying therapy for HNPP; management is supportive. First\u2010tier interventions focus on avoidance of mechanical stress\u2014use of protective padding, ergonomic modifications, and patient education. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy optimize muscle strength and prevent contractures. Analgesics are rarely required due to minimal pain. Vitamin supplementation (e.g., B vitamins) has no proven benefit. Second\u2010tier options include nerve gliding exercises and splinting during acute episodes to facilitate recovery. In refractory cases with persistent conduction block causing functional impairment, surgical decompression at entrapment sites may be considered, although evidence is limited. Genetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and family planning. Pregnancy management includes posture education and splinting. Monitoring for secondary axonal loss guides physiotherapy intensity.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up visits are recommended every 6\u201312 months or sooner if new deficits occur. At each visit, assess motor strength, sensory function, and functional status. Repeat NCS may be performed annually or with acute new symptoms to document changes in conduction velocities and distal latencies. Imaging is generally not repeated unless clinical picture changes suggest alternative pathology. Educate patients on early recognition of new palsies and avoidance strategies. Long\u2010term prognosis is favorable; most maintain functional independence, though cumulative deficits may occur after multiple episodes. Transition of care to primary providers involves detailed summary of genetic results, episode frequency, and management strategies.","clinical_pearls":"1. HNPP biopsy hallmark is tomacula (focal myelin thickenings), not onion bulbs\u2014this distinguishes HNPP from CMT1A. 2. Genetic testing for PMP\u201022 deletion is >98% sensitive and is diagnostic gold standard, avoiding invasive biopsy. 3. NCS in HNPP show segmental conduction block and slowed velocities even in clinically unaffected sites\u2014screen asymptomatic nerves. 4. Management focuses on mechanical prevention: ergonomic adjustments and protective splints can reduce episode frequency by >50%. 5.

Amyloidosis. Hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is characterized by deposition of misfolded TTR protein in peripheral nerves, leading to length-dependent sensory and autonomic small-fiber neuropathy, and in the myocardium, resulting in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Prospective cohort studies (Plant\u00e9-Bordeneuve et al. Neurology 2011;77(14):1367\u20131374; doi:10.1212/WNL.0b013e31822ac19f) report that up to 80% of patients with TTR mutations develop neuropathy and 60% develop cardiomyopathy by age 50. Option B, CIDP, is an acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy with progressive motor weakness and sensory loss; autonomic involvement is rare and it is not familial or associated with cardiomyopathy (Rajabally et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2005;76(8):1124\u20131128; doi:10.1136/jnnp.2004.053207). Option C, DADS (Distal Acquired Demyelinating Symmetric neuropathy), a variant of CIDP, presents with distal sensory loss and motor weakness but lacks autonomic failure and cardiomyopathy link. Option D, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, is an inherited demyelinating or axonal neuropathy presenting with chronic distal weakness and sensory loss, pes cavus, but does not cause autonomic neuropathy or cardiomyopathy (Pareyson et al. Nat Rev Neurol 2017;13(9):492\u2013505; doi:10.1038/nrneurol.2017.95).","conceptual_foundation":"Amyloidosis refers to a group of disorders characterized by extracellular deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils composed of misfolded proteins. The hereditary form due to TTR mutations (formerly familial amyloid polyneuropathy, FAP) follows autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. ICD-11 classifies transthyretin amyloidosis under ED76.0 \u2018Systemic amyloidosis, familial\u2019, while neuropathy is coded as 8D62.20 \u2018Small fiber neuropathy\u2019. Differential diagnoses for familial sensory-autonomic neuropathy include hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN types I\u2013V) and familial amyloid neuropathy; HSAN typically lacks cardiomyopathy. TTR is synthesized in the liver and assembles into a tetramer; point mutations (e.g., Val30Met) destabilize the tetramer, leading to monomer misfolding and aggregation. Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest cells; amyloid deposition occurs in dorsal root ganglia and autonomic ganglia, correlating with sensory and autonomic dysfunction. The heart\u2019s conduction system and myocardium are similarly affected due to interstitial amyloid infiltration. The concept of systemic amyloidosis has evolved from initial descriptions by Rudolf Virchow in the 19th century to molecular identification of TTR in the 1980s.","pathophysiology":"Normal TTR transports thyroxine and retinol-binding protein. Mutant TTR tetramers exhibit decreased kinetic stability, dissociating into monomers that misfold and aggregate into non-branching \u03b2-pleated sheets, forming amyloid fibrils. In peripheral nerves, amyloid fibrils deposit initially in small unmyelinated C-fibers and thinly myelinated A\u03b4 fibers, disrupting axonal transport and producing length-dependent neuropathy. Deposition in autonomic ganglia leads to orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and sudomotor dysfunction. In the myocardium, amyloid fibrils infiltrate the interstitium, increase ventricular wall thickness without chamber dilation (concentric hypertrophy), and stiffen the ventricles, causing restrictive physiology with preserved ejection fraction but diastolic dysfunction (Gertz et al. Circulation 2013;128(22):2247\u20132261; doi:10.1161/CIR.0b013e3182a0cdcd). Deposition also occurs in the conduction system, leading to arrhythmias and heart block. The progression is insidious, with compensatory increases in left atrial pressure and eventual heart failure. The type of TTR mutation influences age of onset, penetrance, and organ involvement pattern.","clinical_manifestation":"Hereditary TTR amyloidosis typically presents in the third to sixth decade. Early manifestations include distal sensory loss (pain and temperature) and burning paresthesias in a length-dependent pattern. Autonomic features\u2014orthostatic hypotension (up to 70% of patients), alternating diarrhea and constipation, urinary retention, and erectile dysfunction\u2014often precede or accompany sensory symptoms (Sekijima et al. Amyloid 2014;21(1):1\u20136; doi:10.3109/13506129.2013.866725). Cardiac involvement presents as exertional dyspnea, peripheral edema, syncope, and arrhythmias; echocardiography shows ventricular wall thickening, bi-atrial enlargement, and myocardial \u2018speckling\u2019. Conduction defects on ECG and low-voltage QRS in limb leads despite thick myocardium are characteristic. Without treatment, median survival is 5\u201315 years from onset, depending on mutation type. Special populations: late-onset Val30Met (after age 50) often exhibits predominant cardiomyopathy, whereas early-onset forms (before age 50) present with neuropathy. HSAN variants lack cardiac involvement and have distinct mutations (e.g., SPTLC1 in HSAN1).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Detailed family history, neurologic exam focusing on length-dependent neuropathy and autonomic testing (orthostatic vitals, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test). Laboratory tests: Serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation to exclude AL amyloidosis (sensitivity 90%, specificity 92%). Genetic testing for TTR mutations confirms diagnosis (100% sensitivity/specificity for known mutations). ECG and echocardiography assess cardiac involvement: echocardiographic strain imaging showing apical sparing pattern has 93% sensitivity and 82% specificity for cardiac amyloidosis. Second-tier: Abdominal fat pad aspiration biopsy with Congo red staining and birefringence (sensitivity 70\u201380%). Endomyocardial or nerve biopsy yields definitive diagnosis. Bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-DPD or PYP has >90% sensitivity and specificity to detect TTR cardiac amyloid in absence of monoclonal protein. Third-tier: Mass spectrometry of biopsy samples to type amyloid fibrils precisely.  Guidelines: AAN Practice Parameter (2011) recommends genetic testing in familial neuropathy with autonomic features (Level B).","management_principles":"Pharmacologic: Tafamidis (stabilizes TTR tetramer) at 20 mg daily reduces all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations by 30% over 30 months (Maurer et al. NEJM 2018;379(11):1007\u20131016; doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1805689; Class I, Level A). Diflunisal, an NSAID TTR stabilizer, slows neurologic progression (Berk et al. Neurology 2013;81(11):1058\u20131064; doi:10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182a0eacf).

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is suspected. What is the most important genetic test?","options":["PMP-22 deletion","CMT1A duplication","MFN2 mutation","GJB1 mutation ## Page 17"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"PMP-22 deletion","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The clinical presentation of recurrent, painless, multifocal mononeuropathies at common compression sites\u2014such as the peroneal nerve at the fibular head or the ulnar nerve at the elbow\u2014is characteristic of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). HNPP is caused by a heterozygous deletion of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene on chromosome 17p11.2, leading to focal segmental demyelination at sites prone to compression. Thus, testing for PMP22 deletion (option A) is the most important and first-line genetic test. Option B (CMT1A duplication) refers to the reciprocal duplication of the same region (including PMP22) and causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, which presents with a more uniform, length-dependent demyelinating polyneuropathy rather than focal compression neuropathies. Option C (MFN2 mutation) underlies CMT2A, an axonal form of CMT, which presents with distal muscle weakness and sensory loss in a length-dependent distribution without the transient focal palsies. Option D (GJB1 mutation) causes X-linked CMT1 (CMTX1), which typically features a chronic peripheral neuropathy with possible central findings, not recurrent focal palsies. Therefore, PMP22 deletion is the correct genetic test for this clinical scenario.","conceptual_foundation":"Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) belongs to the family of inherited peripheral neuropathies. In the current ICD-11 classification, HNPP is coded as 8A41.1 and is distinguished from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) types. HNPP shares a molecular locus with CMT1A on chromosome 17p11.2: a 1.5-Mb region encompassing the PMP22 gene. While CMT1A results from a duplication of this region, HNPP stems from a deletion. Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from the neural crest, and Schwann cells, which myelinate peripheral axons, express PMP22. PMP22 is a transmembrane glycoprotein critical for myelin compaction and Schwann cell homeostasis. Loss of PMP22 dose underlies focal Schwann cell vulnerability at mechanical stress points. Differential considerations include CMT1A (PMP22 duplication), CMTX1 (GJB1 mutation), and other hereditary neuropathies; however, these typically present with chronic, symmetric, distal sensory-motor loss rather than episodic compression palsies.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral nerve impulse conduction relies on compact myelin produced by Schwann cells. PMP22 constitutes ~2\u20135% of peripheral myelin protein and is crucial for myelin integrity. In HNPP, a heterozygous deletion of PMP22 causes haploinsufficiency: reduced PMP22 levels lead to focal myelin instability, particularly at internodes overlying anatomical entrapment sites. Mechanical stress precipitates segmental demyelination and conduction block. The transient nature reflects remyelination by Schwann cells once stress is relieved. In contrast, a reciprocal PMP22 duplication causes uniformly thickened myelin with onion-bulb formation and chronic length-dependent demyelination characteristic of CMT1A, without focal compression phenomena.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with HNPP present in adolescence or early adulthood with recurrent episodes of painless focal neuropathies\u2014most commonly peroneal palsy at the fibular head, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, or median neuropathy at the wrist. Each episode produces sensory loss, paresthesias, and weakness in the distribution of the affected nerve, typically resolving over weeks to months. Between episodes, mild distal sensory deficits or areflexia may persist. In contrast to CMT1A, which features slowly progressive distal weakness, pes cavus, and hammertoes, HNPP shows episodic, multifocal neuropathies without foot deformities in most patients.","diagnostic_approach":"Electrophysiological studies in HNPP reveal conduction slowing and temporal dispersion at entrapment sites, often with prolonged distal latencies and focal conduction blocks. Sensory nerve action potentials may be preserved except at affected sites. Once HNPP is suspected clinically and electrophysiologically, the recommended first-line genetic test is PMP22 dosage analysis via multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or quantitative PCR to detect the 17p11.2 deletion. This has >95% sensitivity and specificity. If negative and clinical suspicion remains high, full PMP22 sequencing or broader neuropathy gene panels may be used to exclude rare point mutations.","management_principles":"Management of HNPP is supportive. Patients should avoid prolonged pressure or repetitive stress on nerves, use protective padding, and undergo physiotherapy to maintain muscle strength and joint range of motion. Orthotic devices can support affected limbs during recovery. There is no disease-modifying therapy for PMP22 haploinsufficiency. Genetic counseling is essential, as HNPP follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with 50% transmission risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up focuses on functional recovery after acute palsies. Neurological examinations every 6\u201312 months assess residual deficits. Nerve conduction studies may be repeated if clinical progression suggests alternative diagnoses. Annual physiotherapy assessments ensure adequate strength and flexibility. Patients should be educated about symptom triggers and red flags (e.g., persistent weakness beyond 3 months) warranting re-evaluation.","clinical_pearls":"1. HNPP presents with recurrent, painless focal neuropathies at entrapment sites\u2014distinct from the chronic distal symmetric pattern of CMT1A.  2. PMP22 deletion accounts for >80% of HNPP cases; MLPA is the gold-standard genetic test.  3. Avoidance of compression (e.g., ergonomic adjustments, padding) is the cornerstone of management.  4. Foot deformities like pes cavus are common in CMT1A but rare in HNPP.  5. Genetic counseling is critical: HNPP is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance.","references":"1.
