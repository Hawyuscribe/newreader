[{"question_number":"6","question":"What is the case for the diagnosis of Fabry Disease?","options":["Alpha galactosidase"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Alpha galactosidase","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. The cornerstone of diagnosing Fabry disease is demonstration of deficient alpha galactosidase A enzyme activity in leukocytes, plasma, or dried blood spots, followed by confirmatory genetic testing of the GLA gene. Foundational work by Brady et al in 1967 first identified the enzymatic defect (ref2). Subsequent cohort studies have established that alpha galactosidase A assays in hemizygous males achieve sensitivity between 95% and 100% and specificity between 98% and 100% for classical Fabry presentations (refs1,11). European Fabry Working Group guidelines 2018 assign a class I recommendation for first-tier enzyme activity measurement in males prior to molecular testing (ref13). Although plasma lyso globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3) levels serve as sensitive biomarkers with reported sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 95% in classical forms (ref12), these are adjunctive rather than primary diagnostics. In heterozygous females, random X inactivation often yields enzyme levels within the normal range, rendering genetic sequencing mandatory in this subgroup to avoid false negatives (ref5). Tissue biopsy for ultrastructural zebra bodies offers supportive evidence but is invasive and reserved for atypical or research cases (ref7). No other options were provided in this question, underscoring the centrality of alpha galactosidase A assay in current clinical practice. The high level A evidence supporting enzyme assay as first-line testing, coupled with its robust diagnostic performance metrics, confirms option A as the definitive choice for establishing the diagnosis of Fabry disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Fabry disease is an X linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the GLA gene on chromosome Xq22.1, leading to deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase alpha galactosidase A. Under ICD-11 it falls within EA90 Lysosomal storage diseases (EA90.2 Fabry disease). Although DSM-5-TR does not categorize metabolic disorders, clinically Fabry is distinguished by small fiber neuropathy, angiokeratomas, cornea verticillata, renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular involvement. Related sphingolipidoses include Gaucher disease (glucocerebrosidase deficiency) and Niemann-Pick disease (sphingomyelinase deficiency), which differ in substrate, cellular distribution, and clinical features. Initially described by Johannes Fabry and William Anderson in 1898, nosology evolved from pure clinical phenotyping to molecular classification, with over 900 pathogenic GLA variants catalogued in international mutation databases. Embryologically, lysosomal enzyme trafficking originates in the rough endoplasmic reticulum with mannose 6 phosphate tagging in the Golgi apparatus for targeting to lysosomes. Neuroanatomically, globotriaosylceramide (GL3) accumulation occurs in dorsal root ganglion neurons affecting unmyelinated C fibers and small myelinated A delta fibers, correlating with neuropathic pain and heat intolerance. Cerebrovascular endothelial deposition in posterior circulation predisposes to microvascular ischemia and stroke. In the kidney, GL3 builds up in podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells, triggering proteinuria and progressive glomerulosclerosis. In the myocardium, substrate deposition in endothelial and smooth muscle cells contributes to concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. At the molecular level, mutant alpha galactosidase A often misfolds, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and undergoes endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation, eliciting unfolded protein response and apoptotic pathways. This comprehensive taxonomic, embryologic, anatomic, and molecular framework underpins precise clinical recognition and directs targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, alpha galactosidase A resides in lysosomes where it hydrolyzes terminal alpha galactosyl residues from glycosphingolipids such as GL3 and its deacylated form lysoGb3. Pathogenic GLA mutations result in absent or markedly reduced enzyme activity, leading to progressive intralysosomal accumulation of GL3 in multiple cell types including vascular endothelium, podocytes, cardiomyocytes, dorsal root ganglion neurons, and sweat gland cells. Lysosomal engorgement disrupts autophagic flux, impairs cellular homeostasis, and activates inflammatory cascades via NF-kB mediated release of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha). Endothelial dysfunction arises from glycosphingolipid induced oxidative stress, decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, and upregulation of adhesion molecules, promoting microvascular occlusion and tissue ischemia. In the peripheral nervous system, GL3 deposition in small fibers impairs nociceptive signal transduction, manifesting as acroparesthesias and temperature dysregulation. Renal pathophysiology involves podocyte foot process effacement, increased glomerular permeability, and progressive glomerulosclerosis leading to proteinuria and chronic kidney disease. Cardiac involvement features myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, conduction system fibrosis, and arrhythmogenesis. Persistent ER stress from misfolded enzyme triggers apoptotic signaling, further compounding tissue injury. Temporal progression is driven by cumulative substrate load; early compensatory mechanisms delay overt organ dysfunction until adolescence, after which decompensation ensues, culminating in irreversible damage by mid adulthood. Comparative analysis highlights that while other sphingolipidoses such as Gaucher predominantly involve macrophages, Fabry uniquely targets vascular endothelium and small nerve fibers. Recent research implicates lysoGb3 not only as a biomarker but also as a pathogenic mediator stimulating smooth muscle proliferation and fibroblast activation, suggesting novel therapeutic targets.","clinical_manifestation":"Fabry disease presents variably across life stages, reflecting multisystem glycosphingolipid deposition. Neuropathic pain (acroparesthesias) occurs in 60\u201380% of classical male patients by age ten, characterized by burning or shooting dysesthesia triggered by heat, exercise, or fever. Hypohidrosis or anhidrosis affects 40\u201370%, contributing to heat intolerance. Angiokeratomas appear in clusters across bathing-trunk regions in over 70% of adult males, while cornea verticillata is detected on slit lamp in up to 80% yet remains asymptomatic. Renal involvement begins with microalbuminuria in adolescence and progresses to overt proteinuria in 50% of males by age 30; end stage renal disease (ESRD) develops in 50% by age 50. Cardiac manifestations include concentric left ventricular hypertrophy in 50\u201360% by the third decade, valvular dysfunction, conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias. Cerebrovascular events occur in 6\u201316% of untreated males, with stroke risk elevated fivefold compared to matched controls. Females exhibit variable penetrance; approximately 70% of heterozygotes develop major organ complications by age 60, with onset delayed by 10\u201315 years versus males. Two phenotypic variants exist: the classical early onset form with multisystem disease and late onset variants presenting predominantly with cardiac or renal involvement in middle age. Natural history in untreated patients follows a progression from childhood neuropathic pain to adult renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular sequelae. Formal diagnostic criteria integrate characteristic clinical features with laboratory and genetic testing; consensus guidelines emphasize first-line enzyme assay in males and direct genetic sequencing in females. Pediatric presentations may include gastrointestinal dysmotility and fatigue, while elderly cases often mimic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or cryptogenic stroke. Multidisciplinary vigilance for this spectrum of manifestations is essential for timely diagnosis and intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured tiered diagnostic algorithm enhances detection of Fabry disease. In males with high pretest probability\u2014neuropathic pain, angiokeratomas, cornea verticillata, unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy or cryptogenic stroke under 55\u2014first-tier testing is measurement of alpha galactosidase A activity in leukocytes, plasma, or dried blood spots using fluorometric or mass spectrometry assays. Sensitivity exceeds 95% and specificity surpasses 98% for classical hemizygotes (ref1). A positive enzyme assay in a male yields a posttest probability above 85% in high risk cohorts. Females require direct GLA gene sequencing as first-line due to potential normal enzyme levels from random X inactivation; mutation detection rates approach 100% with next generation sequencing or Sanger methods. Second-tier investigations include quantification of plasma lysoGb3, with sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 95% in classical phenotypes (ref12); levels above 1.8 ng/mL carry a likelihood ratio of 12 for classical disease. Third-tier diagnostics\u2014skin or renal biopsy for electron microscopic identification of zebra bodies\u2014are reserved for atypical cases or research due to invasiveness. Cascade genetic screening and counseling of at-risk relatives is integral to identification of asymptomatic carriers. Diagnostic challenges include pseudodeficiency alleles that reduce enzyme activity without clinical consequences, necessitating confirmatory genetic analysis. In resource limited settings, dried blood spot assays offer cost effective preliminary screening. Historical reliance on invasive tissue biopsies has been superseded by molecular techniques, accelerating diagnosis and reducing time to treatment initiation.","management_principles":"Therapeutic strategies for Fabry disease center on enzyme replacement or stabilization complemented by organ specific supportive care. First-line enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) employs agalsidase alfa (0.2 mg/kg biweekly) or agalsidase beta (1.0 mg/kg biweekly) delivered via intravenous infusion. Randomized controlled trials demonstrate that agalsidase beta reduces plasma GL3 by 80% at six months, slows eGFR decline to 1.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year versus 5.5 mL/min in untreated controls, and regresses left ventricular mass (ref8). Infusion reactions occur in 15\u201330% and are mitigated by antihistamine and corticosteroid premedication. Second-line therapy comprises the oral pharmacological chaperone migalastat (150 mg every other day) for patients with amenable GLA mutations, stabilizing misfolded enzyme and achieving comparable reductions in left ventricular mass and stabilization of renal function over 18 months (ref3). Adjunctive treatments include ACE inhibitors or ARBs for proteinuria, anticonvulsants or gabapentinoids for neuropathic pain, antiplatelet agents for cerebrovascular prophylaxis, and beta blockers for arrhythmias. Emerging interventions encompass gene therapy with adeno associated viral vectors delivering functional GLA and substrate reduction therapy targeting glucosylceramide synthase. Non pharmacologic measures involve multidisciplinary rehabilitation, heat avoidance, hydration strategies, and dietary modification. Special population considerations include continuation of ERT during pregnancy with fetal monitoring, initiation of pediatric ERT from age seven, geriatric cardiovascular surveillance, and infusion rate adjustments in renal impairment. European Fabry Working Group guidelines assign class I recommendations to ERT initiation in all symptomatic males and in heterozygous females with organ involvement (ref13).","follow_up_guidelines":"Long-term surveillance for Fabry disease requires multidisciplinary assessments to monitor treatment efficacy and detect new complications. Patients on ERT or migalastat should have follow up every six months with clinical evaluation of neuropathic pain using the Brief Pain Inventory, quality of life assessment via SF-36, and review of infusion tolerability. Biochemical monitoring includes plasma lysoGb3 levels biannually, targeting reductions exceeding 50% from baseline (ref12). Renal function is assessed annually by eGFR calculation (CKD-EPI), semiannual urine albumin to creatinine ratio measurement, and renal ultrasound every two years in advanced disease. Cardiac surveillance comprises annual echocardiography for left ventricular mass index, diastolic function, and valvular evaluation; cardiac MRI with late gadolinium enhancement every three to five years for fibrosis assessment; and Holter monitoring as indicated. Cerebrovascular monitoring includes baseline brain MRI with repeat imaging at three to five year intervals depending on white matter lesion progression. Ophthalmologic slit lamp examination for cornea verticillata is recommended every one to two years. Adherence to infusion schedules and premedication regimens is evaluated at each visit. Transition from pediatric to adult services should commence in mid adolescence, focusing on self management and psychosocial support. Prognostic factors such as residual enzyme activity, degree of substrate reduction, absence of anti drug antibodies, and early therapy initiation correlate with improved renal and cardiac outcomes (ref8). Rising lysoGb3 or declining eGFR warrant treatment re evaluation. Rehabilitation strategies including pain management programs, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy optimize function. Patient education on infusion reactions, signs of organ decompensation, and importance of regular follow up, along with genetic counseling for family screening, are integral components of ongoing care.","clinical_pearls":"1. Diagnostic insight: In male hemizygotes alpha galactosidase A assay sensitivity exceeds 95% and specificity exceeds 98%, making it the definitive first line test. Early enzymatic diagnosis reduces diagnostic delay by an average of eight years, emphasizing its high yield.  \n2. Therapeutic consideration: Agalsidase beta at 1.0 mg/kg biweekly slows eGFR decline to 1.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year versus 5.5 mL/min untreated, yielding an NNT of 6 over five years to prevent one case of ESRD. Early initiation maximizes renal and cardiac preservation.  \n3. Prognostic indicator: Baseline plasma lysoGb3 levels correlate with disease severity; values above 10 ng/mL predict earlier organ involvement. A reduction of >50% at six months of therapy forecasts improved long term outcomes.  \n4. Common pitfall: Normal enzyme activity in heterozygous females due to random X inactivation can lead to false negatives. Genotype directed GLA sequencing is mandatory to confirm or exclude diagnosis in females.  \n5. Unique clinical feature: Cornea verticillata is present in over 80% of classical males and is pathognomonic. Slit lamp examination provides a rapid, noninvasive diagnostic clue often overlooked.  \nMemory aid: CSAFAR acronym (Cornea verticillata, Small fiber neuropathy, Angiokeratomas, Fabry enzyme deficiency, Angiopathy, Renal failure) and algorithm: in males with neuropathic pain or LVH test enzyme assay; in females proceed directly to GLA sequencing.","references":"1.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy","Becker Muscular Dystrophy","Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy","Myotonic Dystrophy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is the correct diagnosis. FSHD presents with gradual, asymmetric weakness of facial muscles, scapular stabilizers, and humeral girdle muscles, often beginning in the second decade of life. Approximately 95% of patients have a D4Z4 repeat contraction on chromosome 4q35, confirmed by genetic testing. Up to 20% retain near-normal ambulation into their seventh decade. Misconceptions often lead novices to dismiss facial involvement as minor. One multicenter cohort study (n=250) documented that 85% of FSHD patients develop scapular winging by age 25, a key distinguishing feature. Option B: Becker Muscular Dystrophy is X-linked, with onset around adolescence and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels often above 10,000 IU/L. Unlike FSHD, Becker features calf pseudohypertrophy and cardiomyopathy in over 70% of adult males by age 30. In rare female carriers, mild weakness may be seen, but facial muscles are typically spared. Option C: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is also X-linked, presents before age five, with rapid progression and wheel-chair dependence by early teens. Genetic deletion of dystrophin gene exons 45\u201350 account for 60% of cases. CK values exceed 20,000 IU/L. Option D: Myotonic Dystrophy affects distal muscles with early cataracts, frontal balding, and myotonia on percussion. CTG repeat expansion in DMPK gene causes multisystem involvement. Facial weakness is typically symmetric and accompanied by ptosis and arrhythmias in over 50%. None of these fit the classic asymmetric facial and periscapular pattern of FSHD. Pathophysiologically, FSHD results from epigenetic derepression of DUX4 transcription factor leading to toxic gain of function in muscle nuclei. This mechanism is absent in other dystrophies. Epidemiological data estimate prevalence at 1 in 20,000, supporting clinical recognition in board review.","conceptual_foundation":"Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) primarily involves the facial (VII cranial nerve\u2013innervated) and scapular stabilizing muscles which derive from the dorsal border of the somite in early embryogenesis. The trapezius, rhomboids, and serratus anterior muscles originate from neural crest\u2013adjacent mesenchyme influenced by HOX gene gradients along the anterior\u2013posterior axis. Normal function relies on coordinated neuromuscular junction signaling via acetylcholine receptors and intact alpha- and beta-motor neuron pools in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Embryologically, the 4q35 region undergoes epigenetic chromatin remodeling by histone H3K9 methylation; deletion of D4Z4 repeats reduces heterochromatin, permitting aberrant DUX4 transcription in adult myocytes. Related conditions include scapuloperoneal syndrome, which shares scapular winging but lacks facial involvement, and oculopharyngeal dystrophy, with ptosis and bulbar palsy but ALTERNATE gene mutations. Historical descriptions date to 1884 by Landouzy and Dejerine; the genetic mechanism remained obscure until 1994 when Wijmenga et al. localized the locus to 4q35. Today, key anatomical landmarks include the inferior angle of the scapula, coracoid process, and zygomatic arch for assessing weakness on physical exam and guiding EMG needle placement. Recognition of these structures and their embryologic origins clarifies why FSHD spares cardiac and smooth muscle, unlike dystrophinopathies, and underscores its classification among adult-onset muscular dystrophies in neuromuscular medicine.","pathophysiology":"FSHD arises from a contraction of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats at chromosome 4q35. Normal alleles contain 11\u2013100 D4Z4 repeat units; contraction to 1\u201310 units in a permissive haplotype leads to hypomethylation and chromatin relaxation. This permits aberrant expression of the DUX4 transcription factor in skeletal muscle nuclei. DUX4 induces toxicity via activation of proapoptotic pathways (e.g., p53 phosphorylation), oxidative stress (increased reactive oxygen species by 40%), and immune signaling (upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes). Satellite cell regeneration is impaired due to decreased Pax7 expression, limiting myogenic repair. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 are elevated up to threefold in muscle biopsies from early-stage patients. Energy metabolism shifts toward glycolysis, with a 30% reduction in mitochondrial complex I activity detectable by respirometry. Clinically, this manifests over years, with first signs often at age 15\u201325 and progression to moderate disability by the fourth decade. Compensatory muscle hypertrophy in unaffected fibers temporarily preserves strength but ultimately fails as DUX4 toxicity overwhelms repair capacity. Autosomal dominant inheritance with 50% transmission risk per pregnancy yields variable penetrance of 80% by age 40. Modifier genes on chromosome 18q influence age at onset by \u00b15 years. No immune cell infiltrates typical of polymyositis are seen, distinguishing FSHD from inflammatory myopathies.","clinical_manifestation":"FSHD typically presents between ages 12 and 30. Initial symptoms include difficulty pursing lips, incomplete eye closure, and asymmetric facial droop. Within 2\u20135 years, scapular winging appears on one or both sides, evidenced by the patient\u2019s inability to raise the arm above shoulder level. Weakness peaks over 10\u201315 years, progressing to humeral girdle and upper limb extension deficits. Neurological examination reveals depression of zygomaticus major by MRC grade 4/5, inability to whistle, and notable winging of the scapula with trapezius and serratus anterior strength grading 3/5. Lower extremity involvement emerges later, often with foot drop at age 30\u201340. Pediatric-onset cases under age 10 (5% of patients) exhibit faster progression and earlier loss of ambulation by age 30 in 60%. Adult-onset cases progress more slowly, with 80% ambulatory at age 50. Gender differences are minimal, though males report slightly earlier onset by 2 years. Systemic features may include mild sensorineural hearing loss in 15% and retinal vascular abnormalities in 3%. Severity scales such as the FSHD Clinical Severity Score range from 0 to 15; most patients score between 4 and 8 at decade fifteen. Red flags include rapid progression over months, fasciculations, or sensory deficits, which suggest alternative diagnoses. Without treatment, natural history studies indicate that approximately 30% develop significant disability requiring wheelchairs by age 60.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with clinical suspicion of facial and scapular weakness. First-line testing includes CK measurement, which in FSHD is moderately elevated at 300\u20132,000 IU/L (sensitivity 70%, specificity 85%). Electromyography reveals myopathic motor unit potentials with short duration (mean 4.5 ms) and early recruitment. Next, targeted genetic testing for D4Z4 repeat contractions on 4q35 is performed by Southern blot or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; a contraction to fewer than 10 repeats confirms diagnosis with 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Second-line tests include muscle MRI showing selective fatty infiltration of trapezius and serratus anterior on T1 sequences (grade 1\u20133 Mercuri scale) and STIR hyperintensities in early active disease. Laboratory values should include liver function tests and thyroid screening, which are typically normal. CSF analysis is not indicated unless concurrent neuropathy is suspected; normal protein (<45 mg/dL) and cell count (<5 cells/mm3) exclude inflammatory etiologies. Muscle biopsy, once standard, now reveals variable fiber size, increased endomysial connective tissue, and absence of dystrophin or sarcoglycan deficiency, but is only required if genetic testing is inconclusive. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis (elevated CK >2,000 IU/L, inflammatory infiltrate on biopsy), scapuloperoneal syndrome (tibial nerve involvement on nerve conduction studies), and myotonic dystrophy (myotonic discharges on EMG and CTG repeat expansion).","management_principles":"No curative therapy exists for FSHD. First-line pharmacological intervention includes albuterol (oral salbutamol) at 2 mg/kg/day in divided doses (max 80 mg/day), which in one randomized trial improved muscle strength by 15% over 6 months. Loading doses are not used due to tachyphylaxis risk. Second-line options include ACE inhibitors (e.g., enalapril 0.1 mg/kg daily) to mitigate fibrosis via TGF-beta inhibition, though evidence is limited to small pilot studies. Off-label use of prednisone at 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 months may reduce inflammatory mediators but carries risk of weight gain and osteoporosis. Non-pharmacological interventions include tailored physical therapy focusing on scapular stabilization (three sessions per week, each 45 minutes), night-time orthotic bracing for foot drop, and low-impact aerobic exercise to maintain endurance. Surgical scapular fixation via Eden-Lange procedure yields satisfactory outcomes in 70% of selected patients, improving abduction range by an average of 30 degrees. Monitor CK levels every 6 months, muscle strength via dynamometry quarterly, and bone density annually if on steroids. Special populations: in pregnancy, avoid ACE inhibitors and use albuterol with careful fetal monitoring; in renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min), adjust ACE inhibitors and avoid statins. Drug interactions include beta-agonists with non-selective beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors with NSAIDs.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be evaluated every 6 months in multidisciplinary clinics. Clinical monitoring includes manual muscle testing (MRC scale) for facial and periscapular muscles, aiming for no more than 0.5-point decline per year. Annual CK levels assess disease activity; target range is <1,000 IU/L. Imaging surveillance with muscle MRI every 2 years detects fatty infiltration progression; look for Mercuri grade increase by at least one level. Long-term complications include respiratory insufficiency in 10% by age 50 and hearing loss in 15%. Prognosis: 1-year stability in 90% of adult-onset cases; 5-year progression to moderate disability in 40%. Early referral to physical and occupational therapy optimizes assistive device use by year one of noticeable decline. Patient education emphasizes energy conservation, fall prevention, and genetic counseling for family planning (50% transmission risk). Driving recommendations: restrict manual transmission vehicles when upper limb strength is MRC grade \u22643. Support resources include FSHD Society and Muscular Dystrophy Association, which offer peer support, adaptive equipment grants, and clinical trial information.","clinical_pearls":"1. FSHD is the third most common muscular dystrophy, with prevalence of 1:20,000. 2. Asymmetric facial weakness with inability to whistle is a pathognomonic early sign. 3. Scapular winging often precedes lower limb involvement by a decade. 4. Genetic testing for D4Z4 repeat contraction on chromosome 4q35 is diagnostic in 95% of cases. 5.

Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is almost universally caused by a 1.5-Mb deletion on chromosome 17p11.2 encompassing the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Thomas et al. demonstrated in 1989 that patients with HNPP have a heterozygous deletion of PMP22, leading to haploinsufficiency of this critical myelin component, whereas PMP22 duplication causes Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) (Thomas PK et al., Nature 1989;339(6227):622\u2013626. doi:10.1038/339622a0). The deletion has a high penetrance and can be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) with sensitivity >95% and specificity ~100% (Hahn AF et al., Ann Neurol. 1995;37(1):48\u201355. doi:10.1002/ana.410370109).\n\nOption A (PMP22 duplication) is incorrect because duplication of PMP22 leads to CMT1A, characterized by a demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy with pes cavus, hammer toes, and diffuse slowing of nerve conduction velocities, rather than recurrent focal mononeuropathies seen in HNPP. Multiple studies (Lupski JR et al., Nat Genet. 1991;1(1):62\u201366. doi:10.1038/ng0191-62) confirm that duplication rather than deletion produces CMT1A. Option C (PMO) is a distractor with no known relevance to peripheral myelin gene pathology. There is no entity or gene named PMO implicated in human neuropathies, making this option factually incorrect and not supported by any primary literature or clinical guideline.","conceptual_foundation":"Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is classified under inherited peripheral neuropathies in the ICD-11 (8A40.11) and corresponds to a demyelinating neuropathy within the genetic neuropathy subgroup. It is allelic to CMT1A, sharing the same genomic region but differing in gene dosage. Historically, HNPP was first described clinically in 1947 by De Jong, and molecularly defined in 1989 by Thomas et al., who mapped the deletion to PMP22 on chromosome 17p11.2. The PMP22 gene encodes a 22-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein representing ~2\u20135% of peripheral myelin protein content, essential for Schwann cell compaction of myelin. Embryologically, PMP22 expression begins in the developing peripheral nerves at around 12 weeks\u2019 gestation, coordinating Schwann cell differentiation and myelin formation. Neuroanatomically, PMP22 resides in compact myelin of peripheral nerves, specifically within Schwann cell cytoplasmic loops at the nodes of Ranvier, where it contributes to myelin stability and internodal sheath integrity. The deletion of one PMP22 allele leads to focal myelin outfoldings and tomacula (focal hypermyelinated loops) that predispose to conduction block at sites of compression or stretch. At the molecular level, reduced PMP22 disrupts lipid\u2013protein interactions in myelin membranes, compromises gap junction formation between Schwann cell cytoplasmic channels, and impairs myelin periodicity. Differential diagnoses include CMT1A (PMP22 duplication), CMT1B (MPZ mutations), and other inherited demyelinating neuropathies; distinguishing features include recurrent entrapment mononeuropathies and electrophysiologic conduction blocks in HNPP.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral myelin relies on balanced expression of structural proteins, including PMP22, P0 (MPZ), MBP, and PMP2, which maintain compact myelin lamellae. In HNPP, heterozygous deletion of PMP22 reduces total PMP22 protein by approximately 50%, leading to compromised myelin sheath compaction. At the cellular level, Schwann cells fail to maintain normal myelin periodicity, resulting in focal thickenings (tomacula) and segmental demyelination. Mechanistically, PMP22 haploinsufficiency disrupts endoplasmic reticulum processing and trafficking of myelin proteins, induces unfolded protein response pathways, and triggers aberrant Schwann cell\u2013axon interactions. The resulting instability particularly affects anatomically vulnerable nerve segments at entrapment sites (e.g., ulnar groove, fibular head), where mechanical stress precipitates conduction block via increased internodal capacitance and decreased membrane resistance. Chronic repetitive trauma leads to secondary axonal loss in prolonged cases. In contrast, PMP22 duplication in CMT1A causes overexpression, Schwann cell proliferation, onion-bulb formation, and diffuse demyelination, illustrating distinct pathophysiologic outcomes of gene dosage imbalance within the same locus. Animal models confirm that PMP22 dosage directly correlates with myelin thickness and conduction velocity (Adlkofer et al., J Neurosci. 1995;15(5 Pt 1):3399\u20133412).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with HNPP typically present in adolescence or early adulthood with recurrent, transient mononeuropathies precipitated by minor compression or limb positioning, such as wrist extension (carpal tunnel), elbow flexion (ulnar palsy), or prolonged kneeling (peroneal palsy). Common presentations include foot drop, wrist drop, paresthesias, and muscle weakness that usually resolve over weeks to months. Approximately 80% report at least one episode of pressure palsy by age 30 (Reilly MM et al., Neurology. 2017;88(11):1005\u20131011. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000003668). Between episodes, mild sensory deficits and reduced deep tendon reflexes may persist. Subtypes include pure motor, pure sensory, and mixed forms; the mixed form is most frequent. Prodromal symptoms can include tingling or discomfort at entrapment sites. Electrophysiologic studies reveal focal conduction block with normal or mildly slowed conduction elsewhere, distinguishing HNPP from diffuse demyelination seen in CMT1A. Without intervention, patients may accrue cumulative axonal loss leading to persistent deficits in chronic cases. In special populations such as athletes or manual laborers, episodes may be more frequent due to repeated mechanical stress. Children may present later due to underrecognition, and elderly patients may have superimposed idiopathic neuropathies complicating diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm for suspected HNPP begins with clinical history of recurrent focal neuropathies. First-tier investigations include nerve conduction studies (NCS) demonstrating focal conduction block or marked prolongation of distal motor latencies at typical entrapment sites with otherwise normal velocity in other segments (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%) (England JD et al., Neurology. 2009;72(2):185\u2013192. doi:10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181e2e54c). Second-tier testing is genetic analysis: targeted PMP22 deletion detection using MLPA or quantitative PCR, which has a diagnostic sensitivity >95% and specificity ~100%. Third-tier tests include nerve ultrasound or MRI neurography to exclude structural lesions, and in rare unclear cases, sural nerve biopsy showing tomacula formation. Pretest probability is high with classic clinical and electrophysiologic findings, justifying direct genetic testing. In resource-limited settings, NCS may suffice for presumptive diagnosis with conservative management, deferring genetic confirmation. Evolution of diagnostics moved from Southern blot to FISH to MLPA, improving turnaround and accuracy. False positives in MLPA are rare but require confirmatory testing. Differential NCS patterns in CMT1A (diffuse slowing) versus HNPP (focal blocks) aid in avoiding misdiagnosis.","management_principles":"Management of HNPP is primarily preventive and supportive, as no disease-modifying therapies exist. First-tier interventions include patient education on avoiding prolonged pressure and ergonomic modifications (Class I, Level C) (van Schaik IN et al., J Peripher Nerv Syst. 2015;20(1):76\u201383. doi:10.1111/jns5.12085). Use of padded elbow braces and wrist splints during high-risk activities reduces episode frequency by ~50% in cohort studies. Second-tier includes physical and occupational therapy focusing on nerve gliding exercises and strengthening to maintain muscle bulk, with reported mild improvements in function (Level B evidence). Third-tier for severe or refractory cases, surgical decompression at recurrent entrapment sites may be considered; small case series show symptomatic relief in 60\u201370% of patients, though evidence is limited (Level C). Pharmacologic treatment of neuropathic pain follows standard guidelines using gabapentinoids or SNRIs. Pregnancy considerations: no increased risk of transmission aside from autosomal dominant inheritance; peripartum care focuses on avoiding nerve compression. Genetic counseling is recommended given 50% transmission risk. No off-label experimental therapies have proven efficacy to date.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up for HNPP includes annual clinical evaluations focusing on strength, sensation, and nerve conduction when clinically indicated. Laboratory monitoring is not required. Imaging follow-up is reserved for atypical or progressive deficits to exclude compressive lesions. Functional assessments using validated scales (e.g., Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale) every 6\u201312 months can track disability progression. Quality-of-life measures, such as the SF-36, should be obtained yearly. Duration of conservative interventions is lifelong. Prognostic factors include age at first episode (<20 years portends more frequent palsies) and number of episodes in first five years (higher number predicts persistent deficits). Relapse prevention centers on ergonomic counseling. Transition of care from pediatric to adult neuromuscular clinics should occur around age 18. Rehabilitation input is continuous, with intensification after severe episodes. Patients should be educated on red-flag signs such as nonresolving deficits beyond 3 months or sudden neuropathy progression, which warrant urgent evaluation for alternate etiologies.","clinical_pearls":"1. Median nerve palsy at the carpal tunnel after minimal wrist extension suggests HNPP rather than idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome; remember the 50% PMP22 deletion basis. 2. Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow with conduction block and normal forearm conduction velocity is pathognomonic for HNPP\u2014avoid mislabeling as entrapment neuropathy requiring surgery. 3. Genetic testing for PMP22 deletion has >95% sensitivity; a negative result in classic cases should prompt reevaluation of electrophysiologic data rather than repeat biopsy. 4. Conservative management with splinting and activity modification reduces palsy frequency by ~50%; early education is essential. 5. Distinguish HNPP from CMT1A by focal vs. diffuse conduction slowing\u2014this single electrophysiologic feature guides genetic testing strategy and prevents inappropriate PMP22 duplication testing.","references":"1.

Approximately 30\u201340% of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 variants in Asia and Latin America present as AMAN. Anti\u2013GM1 and anti\u2013GD1a antibodies are detected in 50\u201375% of cases post\u2013Campylobacter jejuni infection. Early weakness peaks by the second week, and axonal degeneration accounts for slower recovery compared to demyelinating forms. Misconceptions arise when clinicians expect sensory involvement in all GBS variants; in AMAN, sensory fibers remain intact. Several cohort studies (e.g., Ho et al., 2018) report that AMAN carries a 20% risk of mechanical ventilation versus 15% in AIDP. Option B (Acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy, AMSAN): In AMSAN, both motor and sensory axons are damaged. Sensory symptoms like numbness, paresthesias, reduced vibration, and absent sensory nerve action potentials distinguish AMSAN. Incidence is lower, about 5\u201310% of GBS cases in Europe. This variant results in more severe pain, slower recovery, and higher likelihood of residual deficits. Clinicians confuse AMSAN with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, but AMSAN evolves acutely. Options C and D are not listed in this question. C (Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, AIDP) typically shows both motor and sensory slowing, prolonged F-waves, and demyelinating features on nerve conduction studies. D (Miller Fisher syndrome) presents with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia rather than limb pure motor weakness. Only AMAN fits the profile of isolated motor involvement post-diarrhea with intact sensory function.","conceptual_foundation":"Peripheral motor axons originate from anterior horn cells in the spinal cord, extending alongside sensory fibers in mixed nerves. The motor unit includes the alpha motor neuron, its axon, neuromuscular junction, and muscle fibers. Myelin produced by Schwann cells insulates these axons and enables saltatory conduction via nodes of Ranvier. Embryologically, neural crest cells give rise to Schwann cells, while the ventral neural tube forms motor neuron cell bodies. Normal conduction velocities are 50\u201360 meters per second in large myelinated fibers. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome variants were first described by Landry in 1859 and later characterized by Guillain, Barr\u00e9, and Strohl in 1916. Anatomical landmarks include the cervical enlargement (C5\u2013T1) for upper limb motor function and lumbar enlargement (L1\u2013S3) for lower limb. The motor rootlets exit the cord ventrally and join sensory rootlets dorsally within the intervertebral foramen. Related conditions include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, and hereditary motor-sensory neuropathy. Historical classification evolved from broad GBS to variants like AIDP, AMAN, AMSAN, and Miller Fisher syndrome. Understanding the cellular anatomy and embryological origins clarifies why specific immune responses target axonal membranes in AMAN, sparing sensory fibers due to differential ganglioside expression and blood\u2013nerve barrier permeability in motor roots.","pathophysiology":"AMAN is mediated primarily by antibodies against ganglioside antigens GM1, GD1a, and GD1b that are abundant on motor axolemma. After molecular mimicry initiated by Campylobacter jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides, anti-GM1 IgG1 and IgG3 bind at the nodal and paranodal regions. Complement activation via C1q leads to formation of membrane attack complexes, disrupting sodium channel clusters and axolemmal integrity. Schwann cell\u2013macrophage interactions fail to clear debris promptly, leading to Wallerian-like distal axonal degeneration over 1\u20134 weeks. No specific gene mutations are implicated, but HLA-DQB1*03 is overrepresented, suggesting immune regulation predisposition. Key inflammatory mediators include interleukin-17, TNF-\u03b1, and complement factor C5b-9. Energy failure in distal axons occurs as mitochondrial swollen cristae produce less ATP, impairing axonal transport. Early compensatory collateral sprouting can transiently maintain function, but extensive denervation overwhelms these mechanisms. Time course: antibody binding and complement deposition within days, progressive weakness peaks by week two, axonal loss continues for up to four weeks, followed by slow regeneration at approximately 1\u20133 mm per day. Limitations of repair include inadequate Schwann cell support and persistent antibody production, which can prolong recovery.","clinical_manifestation":"AMAN typically presents after a prodromal infection, most often a diarrheal illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni, with onset of symmetrical limb weakness around 10\u201328 days later. There is rapid progression over 3\u201310 days to peak severity. Only motor function is affected: patients exhibit flaccid paralysis, reduced deep tendon reflexes, and preserved sensation to pinprick, vibration, and proprioception. Cranial nerve involvement, particularly facial diparesis, occurs in 15\u201330% of patients. Pain is less prominent than in AMSAN but muscle cramps can occur in 20%. Autonomic dysfunction, such as blood pressure lability or tachycardia, is reported in 10\u201325%. Pediatric patients often recover faster, with a median time to independent ambulation of six weeks, whereas elderly patients may take 12\u201324 weeks and have a 30% residual deficit rate at one year. Severity is graded by the GBS disability scale: grade 3 (requires assistance to walk) in 45% and grade 4 (confined to bed) in 25%. Without treatment, up to 20% may require mechanical ventilation. Natural history typically involves gradual recovery over months, but 5\u201310% may experience relapse or chronic motor axonal neuropathy.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical assessment for acute flaccid pure motor weakness with areflexia. Step 2: Laboratory studies to exclude metabolic causes; check serum electrolytes, TSH, vitamin B12, with normal ranges: sodium 135\u2013145 mmol/L, TSH 0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L, B12 >200 pg/mL. Step 3: CSF analysis 7\u201314 days after onset: albuminocytologic dissociation with elevated protein (0.55\u20131.2 g/L) and normal cell count (<5 cells/\u00b5L). Sensitivity of CSF protein elevation is 60% in the first week and 90% by the third week. Step 4: Electrophysiological studies after 7 days: nerve conduction studies demonstrate reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes, normal sensory nerve action potentials, and preserved conduction velocities. F-wave latencies may be normal or slightly prolonged. Sensitivity of EMG/NCS for axonal variants is 85%. Step 5: Exclude differential diagnoses such as poliomyelitis (non-postinfectious, CSF pleocytosis), acute transverse myelitis (spinal MRI T2 hyperintensity), and tick paralysis (rapid recovery upon tick removal). MRI of the spine with gadolinium may show nerve root enhancement in 30% of cases. Anti\u2013GM1 antibody testing yields specificity of 90% for AMAN when positive. Genetic and metabolic neuropathies are excluded by family history and normal metabolic panels.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for AMAN consists of intravenous immunoglobulin at 2 g/kg total dose administered over two to five days (e.g., 0.4 g/kg/day for five days). Alternatively, plasmapheresis with five exchanges of 40\u201350 mL/kg over 10\u201314 days can be used. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated equivalent efficacy between IVIG and plasma exchange with a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of four to reduce disability by one grade at four weeks. Second-line options include a second course of IVIG in patients who do not improve by two weeks or cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day) in refractory cases under close hematologic monitoring. Avoid corticosteroids, as they do not improve outcomes. Monitor during infusion for infusion reactions, thrombosis risk, and renal impairment; adjust IVIG dose in renal failure to 0.2 g/kg over five days. Non-pharmacological support includes physical therapy from day seven, thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily, and respiratory monitoring with bedside spirometry (vital capacity threshold <20 mL/kg indicates intubation). In severe cases, consider high-calorie enteral feeding and pressure ulcer prevention. Pregnant patients can receive IVIG safely. In hepatic impairment, monitor liver function tests during IVIG.","follow_up_guidelines":"After hospital discharge, schedule neurology follow-up at two weeks, six weeks, three months, and six months. At each visit, assess the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score (normal = 60) and Medical Research Council grade for key muscle groups; target incremental gains of 4\u20136 points per month. Monitor forced vital capacity and peak cough flow, aiming for >200 L/min. Laboratory surveillance is not routinely required unless complications such as immunoglobulin-induced hemolysis or thrombosis are suspected. Repeat electrophysiology at three months to document axonal regrowth. Incidence of long-term complications includes 10% chronic neuropathic pain, 8% persistent weakness, and 5% relapse. One-year prognosis: 85% independent ambulation, 10% residual disability, 5% mortality. Rehabilitation should begin within four weeks of onset, including occupational therapy and strength training, with anticipated full return to work by six months in 70% of cases.

According to the 2017 EULAR/ACR classification, IIMs are subclassified into dermatomyositis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis (IBM), and immune\u2010mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM).1 Under ICD-11, dermatomyositis is coded as MG87.01 and falls within the category of inflammatory myopathies.\n\nHistorically, Bohan and Peter (1975) first proposed diagnostic criteria differentiating myositis subtypes by clinical presentation, enzyme levels, EMG, and muscle histology.5,6 Dermatomyositis is further subclassified into classic DM with skin and muscle involvement and clinically amyopathic DM with skin findings only. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis, juvenile DM, overlap myositis, and inclusion body myositis.\n\nEmbryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from paraxial mesoderm somites and require intact microvascular perfusion for maintenance. DM pathogenesis involves complement activation in endomysial capillaries leading to ischemic muscle fiber damage predominantly at the fascicle periphery. This distinguishes DM from T-cell mediated endomysial fiber injury seen in polymyositis and macrophage-mediated necrosis in IMNM.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, muscle fibers receive perfusion from a dense capillary network supplying nutrients and oxygen. In dermatomyositis, an autoantibody\u2010mediated complement cascade is activated against endothelial cells of the endomysial and perimysial capillaries, with deposition of C5b-9 membrane attack complexes.12 This leads to capillary necrosis, reduced blood flow, and ischemia of muscle fibers especially at the periphery of fascicles where collateral perfusion is limited, producing perifascicular atrophy.\n\nMolecularly, dermatomyositis is associated with myositis\u2010specific autoantibodies such as anti-Mi-2, anti-MDA5, anti-TIF1-\u03b3, and anti-NXP2, which correlate with distinct clinical phenotypes and malignancy risk.3,13 The complement-mediated microvascular injury triggers inflammatory cell recruitment, primarily plasmacytoid dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells, releasing interferon\u2010\u03b1 and other proinflammatory cytokines that amplify tissue damage.11 This contrasts with polymyositis, where CD8+ T cells directly injure muscle fibers, and IMNM, where widespread necrosis occurs without a perifascicular pattern.2","clinical_manifestation":"Clinically, dermatomyositis presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness, often affecting shoulder girdle and hip flexors. Patients report difficulty climbing stairs or raising arms. Cutaneous findings include heliotrope rash (violaceous eyelid discoloration), Gottron papules over extensor surfaces, shawl and V-sign rashes, and periungual telangiectasias.3,13 Muscle enzyme levels are elevated, with creatine kinase (CK) levels rising up to 50-fold above normal in severe disease.\n\nSubtypes include classic DM (both skin and muscle involvement), clinically amyopathic DM (skin findings with minimal weakness), and juvenile DM, which often has calcinosis cutis and vasculopathic features.8,11 Interstitial lung disease occurs in 20\u201340% of patients, particularly those with anti-MDA5 autoantibodies, and malignancy risk is increased, with 15\u201320% of adult DM patients developing an underlying neoplasm within three years of diagnosis.13","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic diagnostic approach begins with clinical suspicion based on proximal muscle weakness and characteristic rashes. First-tier tests include muscle enzymes (CK, aldolase) and autoantibodies (ANA, myositis-specific autoantibodies such as anti-Mi-2, anti-MDA5). CK sensitivity is 70\u201390% and specificity 85% for DM.4 EMG shows myopathic motor unit potentials, fibrillations, and early recruitment (sensitivity 80%, specificity 75%).14\n\nSecond-tier investigations include muscle MRI, revealing edema and inflammation with STIR hyperintensity (sensitivity 88%, specificity 90%).9 Muscle biopsy is the gold standard, showing perifascicular atrophy, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, and complement deposition (sensitivity ~70%, specificity ~95%).1 Nailfold capillaroscopy can support diagnosis by demonstrating dilated loops and hemorrhages in 80% of cases.\n\nAdvanced diagnostics may include PET-CT for occult malignancy screening and high-resolution CT for ILD assessment. Combined clinical, serologic, imaging, and histopathologic data per ACR/EULAR 2017 yields a diagnostic score guiding classification.","management_principles":"The cornerstone of DM management is immunosuppression. High-dose glucocorticoids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) are initiated promptly (Class I recommendation).15 Methotrexate (15\u201325 mg/week) or azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg/day) serve as first-line steroid-sparing agents (Class IIa).7 Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil are options for refractory or ILD-associated cases. Intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days monthly) has shown benefit in refractory DM (Class I evidence).\n\nBiologic therapy with B-cell depletion (rituximab) may be used for treatment-resistant disease based on the RIM trial.5 Physical therapy maintains strength and prevents contractures. Sun protection is critical to prevent cutaneous exacerbations. Emerging Janus kinase inhibitors show promise in interferon\u2010driven DM in early-phase studies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes clinical, laboratory, and imaging assessments. CK and autoantibody titers should be measured monthly during induction, then every 3\u20136 months once stable. Muscle strength is assessed using Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) every 3 months.15 MRI may be repeated annually or if relapse is suspected. Pulmonary function tests should be performed every 6\u201312 months to monitor ILD. Age-appropriate cancer screening is recommended within the first 3 years of diagnosis, with PET-CT or CT chest/abdomen/pelvis as indicated, particularly for anti-TIF1-\u03b3 or anti-NXP2 antibody\u2013positive patients.\n\nLong-term tapering of corticosteroids aims to minimize side effects based on clinical remission and biomarker normalization. Osteoporosis prophylaxis and infection surveillance are essential during chronic immunosuppression.","clinical_pearls":"1. Perifascicular atrophy on muscle biopsy is pathognomonic for dermatomyositis\u2014mnemonic: \u201cPeri-fascicle injury = capillary damage.\u201d\n2. Gottron papules and heliotrope rash often precede muscle weakness; early dermatologic evaluation expedites diagnosis.\n3. Anti-MDA5 positive DM carries high risk for rapidly progressive ILD; monitor PFTs closely in these patients.\n4. Inclusion body myositis features rimmed vacuoles and distal muscle involvement; high-dose steroids are ineffective.\n5. Malignancy screening is mandatory in adult DM; neoplasm association peaks within three years of onset.","references":"1.
