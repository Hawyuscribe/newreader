In paraneoplastic Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), first-line symptomatic treatment is the voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) blocker 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) combined with immunosuppression (prednisolone) (Oh et al., 2009; Sanders et al., 2012). Option A (prednisolone + pyridostigmine) is suboptimal because pyridostigmine has limited efficacy in LEMS, as the defect is presynaptic. Option B (3,4-DAP + azathioprine) is used in refractory or long-term maintenance but not initial. Option D is incorrect as C is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"LEMS is a presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder (ICD-11: 8D12) characterized by autoantibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs, often paraneoplastic (small cell lung carcinoma in ~50%). It differs from myasthenia gravis by facilitation on repetitive nerve stimulation and autonomic symptoms. Paraneoplastic LEMS requires cancer treatment plus symptomatic and immunomodulatory therapy.","pathophysiology":"Autoantibodies target P/Q-type VGCC on presynaptic terminals, reducing calcium influx and acetylcholine release. 3,4-DAP blocks presynaptic K+ channels, prolonging depolarization and increasing calcium entry to enhance ACh release. Prednisolone suppresses antibody production. The combination addresses both the presynaptic defect and immune etiology.","clinical_manifestation":"LEMS presents with proximal limb weakness (leg > arm), hyporeflexia with post-exercise facilitation, autonomic dysfunction (dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension), and sometimes bulbar involvement. Tensilon test is negative. EMG shows low CMAP amplitude at rest that increases >100% after maximal voluntary contraction or high-frequency stimulation.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis: VGCC antibody assay (sensitivity 85%, specificity 95%), EMG with incremental response (>100% CMAP increase after exercise), and chest imaging (CTPET) for SCLC. Paraneoplastic panel to exclude other antibodies. Differential includes MG (decremental response on RNS) and motor neuropathies.","management_principles":"Treat underlying SCLC with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Symptomatic therapy: 3,4-DAP starting at 10 mg TID, titrating to 30 mg/day (Class IIa; Level B). Immunosuppression: prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day, tapering over months. If refractory, add azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day or IVIG (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days). Avoid pyridostigmine as monotherapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor strength, reflexes, and autonomic symptoms monthly. Check EMG facilitation at 6\u201312 weeks. Monitor blood glucose, lipids, and bone density on long-term steroids. Repeat chest imaging every 3\u20136 months for tumor surveillance. Taper prednisolone based on clinical response.","clinical_pearls":"1. 3,4-DAP is the symptomatic mainstay in LEMS; it improves CMAP amplitude by >200%. 2. Autonomic features (dry mouth, erectile dysfunction) distinguish LEMS from MG. 3. Post-exercise facilitation on EMG is pathognomonic; look for >100% CMAP increase. 4. Paraneoplastic LEMS mandates tumor screening\u2014small cell lung carcinoma in 50%. 5. Pyridostigmine is ineffective alone; immunosuppression (prednisolone) should accompany 3,4-DAP.","references":"1. Oh SJ, et al. 3,4-diaminopyridine in LEMS: randomized trial.

In ALS, myelination is intact so conduction speed remains normal at >50\u2009m/s in median nerve. A clinical scenario of prolonged F-wave latency to 56\u2009ms might suggest demyelination but not ALS.\n\nOption B: H reflex abnormalities can occur in radiculopathies or S1 nerve root compression (H reflex absent in 70% of S1 radiculopathy). While H reflex tests proximal conduction, ALS affects anterior horn cells, leaving H reflex amplitude often preserved or variably reduced. Misconception: reduced H reflex implies motor neuron disease, but it more reliably indicates radiculopathy.\n\nOption C: Fibrillation potentials are spontaneous, rhythmic discharges of single muscle fibers seen in 85\u201395% of ALS EMGs, especially in limb and paraspinal muscles. They appear 2\u20134\u2009weeks after denervation and have amplitudes of 200\u2013300\u2009\u00b5V at 1\u201330\u2009Hz. Pathophysiologically, motor neuron loss leads to collateral sprouting and muscle fiber hypersensitivity, causing unstable membrane potentials. Multiple guidelines (AAN 2009) cite fibrillations as a core EMG criterion for possible, probable, or definite ALS.\n\nOption D: Prolonged ulnar motor latency (normal \u22643.5\u2009ms) suggests focal mononeuropathy at the elbow or wrist (eg, cubital tunnel) not diffuse anterior horn cell loss. Though slowed latency may coexist in mixed neuropathies, it is neither sensitive nor specific for ALS.\n\nCommon misconceptions: conflating peripheral neuropathy findings with motor neuron disease. Numerous studies (30% misdiagnosed at first EMG) highlight the importance of fibrillation detection.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical structures central to ALS include upper motor neurons in the primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4), Betz cells in layer V, corticospinal tracts traversing the internal capsule, brainstem pyramids, and anterior horn cells (lamina IX) from C3 through L5. Lower motor neurons in ventral horns cardinally innervate skeletal muscle via ventral roots and peripheral nerves. Embryologically, these arise from neuroectoderm in the neural plate by the third week, with motor neurons differentiating under SHH gradients by week 5.\n\nUnder normal physiology, excitatory glutamatergic inputs from the cortex modulate alpha motor neuron firing via AMPA and NMDA receptors, balanced by inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. Descending tracts regulate tone and reflex arcs through Renshaw cells. Clinically, the Babinski sign overlying corticospinal involvement highlights this integration.\n\nRelated syndromes include primary lateral sclerosis affecting only upper motor neurons, progressive muscular atrophy limited to lower motor neurons, and hereditary spastic paraplegia impacting corticospinal fibers.\n\nHistorically, Charcot first described ALS in 1869 by correlating pathological anterior horn degeneration with clinical weakness. Over time, EMG became standardized by the 1950s. Key landmarks are the central sulcus demarcating motor strip and the ventral horn\u2019s 'butterfly' shape on transverse spinal sections. Recognition of TDP-43 proteinopathy in 2006 refined the disease model, linking cytoplasmic inclusions to neurodegeneration.","pathophysiology":"ALS pathogenesis involves excitotoxicity from excessive glutamate due to reduced EAAT2 transporter expression by 60% in astrocytes, leading to sustained NMDA receptor activation and Ca2+ influx. Oxidative stress from SOD1 mutations (20% familial ALS cases) causes free radical accumulation. C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansions (GGGGCC) account for 40% of familial and 5% of sporadic cases, causing RNA foci that sequester RNA-binding proteins and disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport.\n\nAt the cellular level, disrupted autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system inefficiency lead to TDP-43 and FUS protein misfolding into cytoplasmic inclusions. Neuroinflammation arises with microglial and astrocytic activation, releasing cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 (elevated 2.5-fold) and IL-1\u03b2. Energy metabolism shifts with decreased mitochondrial complex I activity by 30%, causing ATP deficits.\n\nDenervation begins at distal axon terminals within weeks of motor neuron stress, triggering compensatory collateral sprouting. However, sprout capacity declines by 50% over 6\u2009months. Progressive anterior horn cell loss averages 1\u20132% per month, producing muscle fiber atrophy and fibrillation potentials on EMG by 2\u20134\u2009weeks post-denervation. Upper motor neuron involvement follows a similar timeline, culminating in spasticity and hyperreflexia.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset typically occurs between ages 50 and 65 (median 55\u2009years) with asymmetric limb weakness in 70% of cases (upper limb presenting in 60%, lower limb in 40%). Bulbar onset (dysarthria, dysphagia) accounts for 25%, with a median time to peak disability of 18\u2009months. Early fasciculations appear at rest and during over 30% of mild activity.\n\nNeurological exam reveals combined lower motor neuron signs (atrophy, fasciculations, decreased tone, muscle strength graded 3/5 to 4/5) and upper motor neuron features (spasticity, hyperreflexia with clonus, Babinski sign) in at least two regions. Cranial nerves III\u2013VI are spared until late, whereas VII\u2013XII may show bulbar involvement.\n\nIn juvenile ALS (<25\u2009years), survival extends to a median of 6\u2009years versus 3\u2009years in elderly (>70\u2009years). Men are affected 1.5:1 over women. Systemic manifestations include weight loss >10% of baseline, neurogenic respiratory muscle weakness leading to nocturnal hypoventilation (PaCO2\u2009>\u200945\u2009mmHg).\n\nSeverity scales like ALSFRS-R decline by 0.9\u2009points/month on average. Red flags distinguishing mimic disorders include sensory loss or isolated autonomic dysfunction, which are absent in ALS. Without treatment, median survival is 3\u20135\u2009years from symptom onset.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical assessment seeking combined UMN and LMN signs in at least three regions. Step 2: Routine labs: CBC, CMP, TSH (normal ranges: Na 135\u2013145\u2009mmol/L; TSH 0.5\u20134.5\u2009\u00b5U/mL). Exclude metabolic mimics (e.g., hyperthyroidism).\n\nStep 3: Electrophysiology: EMG and NCS. Sensitivity for ALS is 82% and specificity 85%. Key EMG findings: fibrillation potentials (85\u201395%), positive sharp waves, large-amplitude, long-duration MUPs (>14\u2009ms, >4\u2009phases), reduced recruitment. NCS shows normal conduction velocity (>50\u2009m/s), normal distal latencies, normal sensory amplitudes.\n\nStep 4: MRI brain/spine with T2 and STIR sequences to exclude structural lesions (eg, syringomyelia, multiple sclerosis). MRI spinal T2 hyperintensity in anterior horns is a nonspecific finding in 20% of ALS cases.\n\nStep 5: CSF analysis if infection or inflammatory mimics suspected: cell count <5\u2009cells/mm3, protein 15\u201345\u2009mg/dL.\n\nStep 6: Genetic testing for SOD1 and C9orf72 if familial history. Step 7: Exclude multifocal motor neuropathy (anti-GM1 antibodies, 50% positive). Differential diagnoses include cervical spondylotic myelopathy, Kennedy disease, and PMA.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy is Riluzole 50\u2009mg orally twice daily (2\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009mg/d), initiating with 50\u2009mg on day 1, then maintenance for life unless ALT >5\u00d7\u2009ULN. It extends survival by approximately 2\u20133\u2009months (95% CI 1.2\u20134.1 months).\n\nEdaravone is second-line: intravenous 60\u2009mg/day over 60\u2009minutes daily for 14\u2009days, then 60\u2009mg on 10 of 14\u2009days monthly. It slows ALSFRS-R decline by 33% at 24\u2009weeks.\n\nSymptomatic treatments: Baclofen 5\u201310\u2009mg orally TID for spasticity (max 80\u2009mg/day), Tizanidine starting at 2\u2009mg Q8\u2009h (max 36\u2009mg/day). For sialorrhea, glycopyrrolate 1\u2009mg QID or botulinum toxin injections (25\u2009MU per parotid gland). Noninvasive ventilation with BiPAP at 6\u20138\u2009cm\u2009H2O IPAP, 4\u2009cm\u2009H2O EPAP improves 1-year survival by 25%.\n\nMonitor LFTs monthly for Riluzole. Avoid use in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Interactions: Riluzole with CYP1A2 inhibitors increases exposure 1.5-fold.

Check LFTs monthly during Riluzole therapy, aiming for ALT/AST <2\u00d7\u2009ULN.\n\nSchedule MRI annually if new symptom patterns emerge. Nutritional assessments monthly, with goal BMI \u226518.5\u2009kg/m2. Monitor for depression with PHQ-9 every 6\u2009months. Long-term complications include respiratory failure (incidence 80% at 3\u2009years), dysphagia (70% by year 2), and aspiration pneumonia (30% within 5\u2009years).\n\nPrognosis: median survival is 36\u2009months; 1-year survival ~90%, 5-year ~20%. Early integration of physical therapy and speech therapy within 3\u2009months of diagnosis improves quality-of-life scores by 25%.

Bariatric surgery predisposes to B12 malabsorption due to intrinsic factor deficiency or reduced gastric acid. Thiamine deficiency (B1) causes Wernicke encephalopathy with ophthalmoplegia and ataxia, not isolated posterior column signs. Vitamin E deficiency can produce an analogous spinocerebellar ataxia but is rarer and usually seen in fat malabsorption syndromes. Vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia and muscle weakness but not selective dorsal column impairment.","conceptual_foundation":"Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is absorbed in the terminal ileum bound to intrinsic factor. Deficiency leads to demyelination of dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts. In ICD-11, nutritional deficiencies of B12 are coded under 5A1A. Differential includes tabes dorsalis (syphilis), vitamin E deficiency, and hereditary ataxias. Historically recognized by Thomas Addison in 1849, linked to pernicious anemia by Minot and Murphy in 1926. Neural embryology is not directly relevant, but dorsal columns arise from neural crest migration. Neuroanatomically, the gracile and cuneate fasciculi transmit vibration and proprioceptive information.","pathophysiology":"Cobalamin is a cofactor for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Deficiency leads to accumulation of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, causing myelin destabilization through impaired methylation. Demyelination begins in the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts. Early changes include microglial activation and vacuolation of myelin sheaths, progressing to macrophage infiltration and gliosis. Clinical signs reflect loss of large-fiber proprioception and UMN signs from corticospinal involvement.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop symmetric paresthesias, numbness, and weakness starting in the lower limbs, with ataxic gait exacerbated in the dark (positive Romberg).

In AIDP, Schwann cell myelin sheaths undergo autoimmune attack. Embryologically, neural crest cells give rise to Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglia. Normal function requires saltatory conduction along nodes of Ranvier; integrity depends on compact myelin and proper sodium channel clustering. Related conditions include CIDP, hereditary demyelinating neuropathies (Charcot-Marie-Tooth types 1 and 4), and paraneoplastic neuropathies. Historically, Guillain, Barr\u00e9, and Strohl described the syndrome in 1916, with electrodiagnostic criteria refined by Hadden et al. in 1998. Key anatomical landmarks: dorsal root entry zones, ventral horn motor neuron axons, and the nerve plexuses. Clinically significant structures: spinal nerve roots (C5\u2013T1 brachial, L2\u2013S2 lumbosacral), dorsal columns spared in AIDP, differentiating central from peripheral pathology. The blood-nerve barrier at endoneurial vessels is compromised in inflammatory neuropathies, allowing macrophage infiltration and segmental demyelination.","pathophysiology":"AIDP is mediated by molecular mimicry; Campylobacter jejuni lipooligosaccharides resemble gangliosides (GM1, GD1a). Antiganglioside IgG antibodies activate complement (C3b, MAC), leading to Schwann cell injury. Macrophages infiltrate endoneurium, stripping myelin in segmental patches. Cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) recruit inflammatory cells. Demyelination slows conduction velocity by 30\u201380%, prolongs distal latencies by >130%, and blocks conduction at internodes. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DR2 and HLA-DQ1 haplotypes; no single Mendelian variant. Remyelination begins 2\u20134 weeks post-onset, with up-regulation of myelin basic protein and neuregulin signaling via ErbB2 receptors on Schwann cells. Axonal preservation occurs in 70%, but 30% develop secondary axonal degeneration if demyelination is severe or prolonged. Energy demands increase as Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase works overtime to maintain ion gradients, leading to metabolic exhaustion in prolonged conduction block. Compensation via collateral sprouting may occur over months, but functional recovery may be limited by misdirected reinnervation.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms start 7\u201321 days post-infection, with distal paresthesia in feet (85%) and hands (75%). Motor weakness is symmetrical, ascending, affecting lower limbs before upper. Peak weakness occurs by week 2\u20134, with 30% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation by day 10. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in 90%. Cranial nerve involvement (facial palsy) occurs in 50%, bulbar weakness in 25%. Pain is present in 60%, often radicular. Autonomic dysfunction\u2014tachycardia (70%), orthostatic hypotension (45%)\u2014can cause arrhythmias and blood pressure lability. Sensory exam shows diminished vibration and proprioception distally. Pediatric cases progress more rapidly but have better recovery; elderly have slower remyelination and 20% mortality versus 3% in adults. Women and men are affected equally. Untreated natural history: nadir at 14 days, plateau 2\u20134 weeks, recovery over 6\u201312 months, with 20% left with significant deficits. Rapidly progressive weakness, bulbar signs, or autonomic instability are red flags necessitating ICU care.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical evaluation for ascending weakness, areflexia, recent infection. Decision point: If mechanical ventilation or bulbar signs, admit to ICU. Step 2: CSF analysis at days 7\u201314: protein 100\u20131000 mg/dL, cells <10/mm\u00b3 (sensitivity 80%, specificity 90%). Step 3: Nerve conduction studies by day 7: demyelinating pattern\u2014conduction velocity <60% of lower limits, distal latency >130% normal, F-wave latencies prolonged >120%, conduction block. Sensitivity 70\u201395%. Step 4: Exclude differential diagnoses: spinal cord MRI with T2/STIR sequences to rule out transverse myelitis; EMG to exclude motor neuron disease (no fibrillations in early AIDP). Step 5: Serologies\u2014for Campylobacter (acute phase IgM 45%), GM1 antibodies (positive in 30%). Second-line: nerve ultrasound to assess nerve root enlargement. Autonomic testing for heart rate variability. Diagnostic criteria: Brighton criteria level 1 requires clinical, CSF, and electrophysiology data. Exclude CIDP: progression \u22644 weeks supports AIDP, >8 weeks suggests CIDP.","management_principles":"First-line: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 0.4 g/kg/day over five days, total dose 2 g/kg; response in 70% improves MRC sum score by \u22654 points at four weeks. Alternative: Plasma exchange (PE), 4\u20136 exchanges of 50 mL/kg over 10\u201314 days; reduces time to unaided walking by 25%, relative risk reduction 30%. Do not combine IVIG and PE concurrently. Second-line: Steroids are ineffective in AIDP but used in CIDP (1 mg/kg/day prednisone). Third-line: Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day) reserved for refractory cases. Avoid gabapentin in autonomic instability. Monitor for IVIG side effects\u2014headache (30%), thrombosis (1%), renal failure (<0.5%). Supportive: DVT prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40 mg subcut daily, monitor platelets. Physiotherapy from day 7: passive ROM thrice daily, preventing contractures. ICU management\u2014ventilator settings: tidal volume 6\u20138 mL/kg, plateau pressure <30 cm H\u2082O. Special populations: Pregnancy\u2014IVIG safe; renal impairment\u2014adjust infusion rate to prevent acute kidney injury.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reevaluate at two weeks post-treatment for strength and respiratory function (spirometry: FVC target >2 L). Follow monthly for six months, then quarterly to one year. Monitor CSF protein at three months if relapse suspected. Electrophysiology at six months to assess remyelination: conduction velocity improved by \u226530% indicates good prognosis. Watch for long-term complications: residual weakness (20% incidence), neuropathic pain (30%), fatigue (50%). One-year functional independence in 80%; five-year full recovery in 60%. Rehabilitation: occupational and physical therapy thrice weekly for 3\u20136 months. Patient education: stress infection prevention, encourage gradual exercise. Driving permitted if MRC sum score >48/60. Resources: GBS Foundation International and local support groups. Document return-to-work timeline: desk jobs at three months, physical labor at six months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Antecedent infection in 60\u201370% within 1\u20133 weeks suggests AIDP over CIDP. 2.
