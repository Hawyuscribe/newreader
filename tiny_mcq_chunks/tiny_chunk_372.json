On muscle biopsy, DMD shows muscle fiber necrosis, regeneration, fat infiltration, and absence of dystrophin on immunostaining. Option A (antimicrotubule-associated myopathy) is not a recognized entity; antimicrotubule agents may cause neuropathy but not this pattern. Options B (myasthenia gravis) and C (Lambert-Eaton) involve neuromuscular junction dysfunction without primary muscle pathology on biopsy.","conceptual_foundation":"DMD is an X-linked recessive dystrophinopathy (ICD-11: 8C50.1). It presents in early childhood with Gower\u2019s sign, calf pseudohypertrophy, and progressive proximal weakness. The dystrophin gene (DMD) on Xp21 undergoes frame-shift mutations leading to absent dystrophin protein.","pathophysiology":"Dystrophin links the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. In its absence, muscle fibers undergo repeated damage during contraction, leading to inflammatory infiltration, necrosis, and eventual replacement by fat and connective tissue. Serum CK is markedly elevated (10\u2013100\u00d7 normal).","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is between ages 2\u20135, with delayed motor milestones, frequent falls, and difficulty running. Proximal muscle weakness is more pronounced in the pelvic girdle. By early teens, patients are wheelchair-dependent. Cardiomyopathy and respiratory muscle weakness develop in adolescence.","diagnostic_approach":"Serum CK (elevated to >10,000 U/L), genetic testing for DMD gene mutations, and muscle biopsy showing dystrophin deficiency confirm the diagnosis. ECG and echocardiogram assess cardiomyopathy.","management_principles":"Corticosteroids (prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day) slow disease progression and prolong ambulation (Clinical Trial: Moxley et al., 2017). ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers manage cardiomyopathy. Physical therapy helps maintain range of motion. Emerging gene therapies (eteplirsen) target dystrophin restoration.","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess muscle strength, CK levels, and functional scales every 6 months. Cardiac evaluation annually. Pulmonary function tests starting at age 10. Bone density monitoring due to steroid use.","clinical_pearls":"1. Gower\u2019s sign is pathognomonic for proximal lower extremity weakness in DMD. 2. Serum CK is >10,000 U/L even before clinical symptoms. 3. Carrier females may have mild weakness and cardiomyopathy. 4. Early initiation of steroids prolongs ambulation by ~2\u20133 years. 5. Eteplirsen is approved for patients with exon 51 skip-amenable mutations.","references":"1. Bushby K et al. Diagnosis and management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Part 1.

An axonal lesion on EMG indicates involvement of a muscle innervated by the facial nerve. Stylohyoid, innervated by a branch of the facial nerve, is correct (Option B). Masseter and temporalis are innervated by the trigeminal nerve (V), and levator palpebrae by the oculomotor nerve (III), making Options A, C, and D incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"The blink reflex examines afferent via V1 and efferent via VII. Facial nerve motor branches control muscles of facial expression and small suprahyoid muscles. The stylohyoid originates from the styloid process, elevates the hyoid, and is innervated by the facial nerve via the digastric branch.","pathophysiology":"Axonal injury in facial nerve lesions reduces motor unit potentials in its target muscles. Injury proximal to branching can affect stylohyoid conduction, detected on EMG as reduced amplitude. In contrast, V3- or III-innervated muscles remain normal.","clinical_manifestation":"Bell\u2019s palsy presents with acute unilateral facial weakness, hyperacusis, and diminished corneal blink. Involvement of stylohyoid may cause subtle swallowing symptoms but often subclinical.","diagnostic_approach":"Electrophysiology: EMG shows reduced compound muscle action potentials in affected facial muscles.

Stylohyoid is innervated by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) and would show denervation potentials on EMG in Bell\u2019s palsy. Levator palpebrae is innervated by the oculomotor nerve (III) and is unaffected; Masseter and Temporalis are innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3). Common misconceptions include believing all facial muscles are tested equally; in reality, EMG must target a muscle supplied by the affected nerve.","conceptual_foundation":"Bell\u2019s palsy is an idiopathic peripheral facial nerve (VII) palsy. The facial nerve arises in the pontine tegmentum, exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen, and innervates muscles of facial expression. The stylohyoid lies in the posterior triangle of the neck, immediately inferior to the stylomastoid foramen, making it a reliable EMG target. The condition is classified under ICD-11 8A60.0, and historically was distinguished from central facial palsies by involvement of the entire half\u2010face.","pathophysiology":"Normal facial nerve conduction involves myelinated fibers transmitting impulses from the facial nucleus to muscles of expression. In Bell\u2019s palsy, presumed viral\u2010mediated inflammation leads to focal demyelination and conduction block in the nerve canal. This results in Wallerian degeneration distal to the lesion. Denervation causes spontaneous fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves on EMG in affected muscles like stylohyoid within 2\u20133 weeks of onset.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with acute onset unilateral facial weakness, inability to wrinkle forehead, close eye, or smile. Approximately 70% have postauricular pain. Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eye on attempted closure) is characteristic. Taste disturbances on the anterior two\u2010thirds of tongue occur in ~50%. Hyperacusis may occur if stapedius branch is affected.","diagnostic_approach":"Electrodiagnostic studies are indicated after 10 days if recovery is delayed. First\u2010tier is needle EMG of stylohyoid to quantify denervation. Sensitivity for predicting poor recovery is ~90% if >3 muscles show fibrillations (Fischer et al. 1997). Nerve conduction studies of the facial nerve across the stylomastoid foramen assess amplitude reduction; >90% reduction correlates with poor prognosis.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy is oral corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 10 days, taper over 5 days) within 72 h of onset (AAN Guideline 2013, Level A). Antiviral therapy (acyclovir) may be added in severe cases (Level B). Eye care with lubrication and patching prevents corneal ulceration. Physical therapy may aid synkinesis prevention.","follow_up_guidelines":"Re\u2010evaluate at 4 weeks; if no improvement, consider referral for MRI to rule out neoplasm or Lyme serology if endemic. At 3 months, persistent deficits warrant electrodiagnostic re\u2010assessment. Chronic sequelae such as synkinesis may be treated with botulinum toxin.","clinical_pearls":"1. Stylohyoid EMG is most sensitive for facial nerve denervation. 2. Absence of forehead involvement suggests central lesion. 3. Early steroids improve recovery by ~20% (NNT = 6). 4. Eye protection is critical\u2014corneal complications occur in ~10%. 5. Synkinesis may develop in 15\u201330% and is treated with botulinum toxin.","references":"1. Peitersen E.
