[{"question_number":"3","question":"A patient came with left side weakness; computed tomography (CT) showed right semiovale hypodensity; what is the next step?","options":["CTA","Repeated question","Complete in another exam","Answer correct"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"CTA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. CTA. In the evaluation of an acute ischemic stroke with non-contrast CT showing a focal hypodensity in the centrum semiovale, CTA is indicated to assess for large-vessel occlusion or high-grade stenosis. AHA/ASA guidelines (2018) recommend vascular imaging immediately after non-contrast CT in patients considered for reperfusion therapy (Class I; Level A). Options B, C, D are non-clinical distractors without relevance: 'Repeated question' and 'Complete in another exam' are not clinical interventions; 'Answer correct' is nonsensical in this context.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion presents with sudden contralateral motor deficits. The centrum semiovale, supplied by deep perforating branches of MCA, appears hypodense early on CT. Vascular imaging defines arterial patency. CTA uses iodinated contrast to visualize extracranial and intracranial vessels, guiding decisions on thrombectomy. This fits WHO ICD-11 code 8B21. Clinically, rapid imaging allows timely reperfusion to salvage penumbra.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion relies on intact intracranial arteries. Occlusion of a right MCA branch reduces downstream perfusion, causing cytotoxic edema and cytoplasmic hypodensity on CT. Molecularly, ischemia leads to Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase failure, glutamate release, Ca\u00b2\u207a influx, and neuronal death. CTA identifies the site and degree of occlusion, linking imaging to pathophysiology.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with acute onset contralateral weakness, often involving face and arm more than leg. NIHSS scores correlate with vessel occlusion severity. Early CT may be normal or show subtle hypodensity; vascular imaging identifies occlusion even when parenchymal changes are minimal.","diagnostic_approach":"First tier: Non-contrast CT to exclude hemorrhage. Second tier: CTA from aortic arch to vertex for vessel patency (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95% for large-vessel occlusion). Perfusion CT or MRI can complement. In resource-limited settings, duplex ultrasound may help but is less sensitive for intracranial vessels.","management_principles":"Per AHA/ASA (2018): If CTA demonstrates large-vessel occlusion within 6 hours (and select patients up to 24 hours by DAWN/DEFUSE-3 criteria), mechanical thrombectomy is indicated (Class I; Level A). IV tPA remains indicated within 4.5 hours if no contraindications. Blood pressure management and neurocritical care principles apply.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurological checks every 15 minutes during and after reperfusion therapies, then hourly. Repeat imaging if neurological deterioration. Monitor for hemorrhagic transformation. Long-term: carotid imaging at 2 weeks and 3 months if stenosis is present.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always perform CTA immediately after non-contrast CT in suspected large-vessel stroke. 2. The centrum semiovale hypodensity may be subtle\u2014vascular imaging can detect occlusions before parenchymal changes. 3. Time is brain: each minute of delay loses ~2 million neurons. 4. CTA has high sensitivity and specificity for proximal occlusions. 5. CTA findings guide eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy.","references":"1.

FMD frequently affects the renal arteries, leading to hypertension and potential ischemic complications. According to the 2018 AHA/ACC FMD guideline (Class I, Level B), invasive angiography remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis and allows for concurrent intervention if significant stenoses are found. No other option was provided; hence, A is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory vascular disease characterized by alternating areas of stenosis and aneurysmal dilatation ('string-of-beads'). It is classified under vascular disorders in ICD-11 and is most common in women aged 20\u201360. FMD preferentially involves medium-sized arteries: renal (renal\u2010artery FMD), carotid/vertebral (cervicocranial FMD), and less commonly mesenteric. The disease evolves from medial fibroplasia histologically. Embryologically, the arterial smooth muscle cells involved arise from mesenchymal precursors; dysregulation in extracellular matrix remodeling contributes to pathogenesis.","pathophysiology":"Normal medium-sized arteries have a uniform smooth muscle layer. In FMD, aberrant smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen deposition create alternating stenotic and aneurysmal segments. This leads to turbulent flow, increased shear stress, and risk of dissection or thrombosis. The renal arteries, when narrowed, lead to renal hypoperfusion, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and refractory hypertension. Histologically, the medial fibroplasia subtype (most common) shows circumferential collagen deposition and loss of smooth muscle.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with renal FMD typically present with new-onset or resistant hypertension (often severe, <50 years old). Other presentations include abdominal/br flank pain, bruit over the flank, headache, and, if cerebrovascular arteries are involved, pulsatile tinnitus, headaches, and stroke or TIA. Young women are most affected (sex ratio ~9:1). The natural history without intervention includes progressive hypertension, risk of renal atrophy, and vascular events (dissection, aneurysm rupture).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Duplex ultrasonography for renal artery peak systolic velocity (>180\u2013200 cm/s suggests >60% stenosis). CTA/MRA: noninvasive with sensitivity/specificity ~85\u201395%. Second-tier: Digital subtraction angiography (gold standard; sensitivity ~100%, specificity ~100%). Pre-test probability is high in young hypertensive women with abdominal bruits. Noninvasive modalities are used for screening; invasive angiography for definitive diagnosis and possible angioplasty.","management_principles":"Initial therapy includes antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors, ARBs). Antiplatelet therapy may be given if cerebrovascular involvement. For focal stenoses causing refractory hypertension or renal ischemia, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (without stenting) is first-line (Class I, Level B). Medical therapy alone is appropriate for mild disease. Surgical revascularization is reserved for complex lesions or failed angioplasty.","follow_up_guidelines":"After intervention, blood pressure should be monitored monthly until stable. Renal duplex ultrasound at 6\u201312 months post-angioplasty to assess patency. In patients managed medically, imaging (CTA/MRA) every 1\u20132 years to monitor for progression or new aneurysms. Lifelong blood pressure control and cardiovascular risk modification are essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. FMD is female\u2010predominant; suspect in women <50 with resistant hypertension. 2. 'String-of\u2010beads' on angiography is pathognomonic. 3. Duplex ultrasound is a useful screening tool. 4. Angioplasty without stenting is preferred for renal FMD. 5.

Broca\u2019s aphasia results from lesion of Broca\u2019s area located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus, spanning pars opercularis (Brodmann area 44) and pars triangularis (area 45) within the frontoparietal operculum of the dominant hemisphere (Amunts et al. Brain Struct Funct 2010;214(5\u20136):469\u2013481). Option B (Temporal lobe) implicates Wernicke\u2019s area. Option C (Occipital lobe) affects visual cortex. Option D (Frontal lobe) is too broad and nonspecific; only the opercular region is critical for language production.","conceptual_foundation":"Language functions are lateralized to dominant hemisphere, with Broca\u2019s area in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) controlling speech production. The frontoparietal operculum covers IFG and adjoining parietal cortex. Historically described by Paul Broca in 1861, this region integrates motor planning for articulation. It is distinct from classic prefrontal cortex involved in executive functions. Neuroanatomically it lies anterior to the central sulcus and inferior to the inferior frontal sulcus.","pathophysiology":"Broca\u2019s aphasia arises from disruption of cortical and subcortical circuits subserving language production. Lesions impair connectivity between IFG and motor cortices via the frontal aslant tract and arcuate fasciculus. This leads to nonfluent, effortful speech with preserved comprehension. Pathologically, ischemic strokes to the superior division of the left MCA frequently involve the opercular region, causing focal necrosis and gliosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients exhibit nonfluent, telegraphic speech, agrammatism, and impaired repetition with relatively preserved comprehension. Speech is halting, with distorted articulation and apraxia of speech in up to 50%. Writing mirrors speech output. Rarely, Broca\u2019s area lesions produce transient mutism. Lesion studies show that involvement of pars opercularis correlates most strongly with motor speech deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical exam: assess fluency, naming, repetition, comprehension. Imaging: MRI with DWI to identify acute ischemia in left inferior frontal region. Diffusion tensor imaging can delineate arcuate fasciculus involvement. Functional MRI and Wada testing are research tools. Pre-test probability is high in sudden onset nonfluent aphasia with right-sided weakness (left MCA territory stroke).","management_principles":"Acute ischemic stroke protocols apply: IV tPA within 4.5 hours (AHA/ASA Class I). Endovascular thrombectomy for proximal MCA occlusion (Class I). Post-acute care: intensive speech and language therapy (Class I, Level A; AAN 2014). Constraint-induced aphasia therapy and melodic intonation therapy are adjuncts.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular assessments by speech pathology at least weekly for first 3 months, then monthly up to one year. Serial MRI at 3\u20136 months to monitor gliosis. Monitor for depression and apraxia of speech. Long-term prognosis: ~50% achieve functional communication with intensive therapy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Nonfluent, effortful speech with intact comprehension defines Broca\u2019s aphasia. 2. Lesions in pars opercularis (BA44) produce apraxia of speech. 3. Superior division MCA strokes commonly spare Wernicke\u2019s area. 4. Early speech therapy improves outcome (AAN Level A). 5.
