[{"question_number":"2","question":"An elderly male with left-sided weakness and dysarthria, who is on dabigatran, underwent thrombectomy without receiving tPA.

Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with high affinity, rapidly reversing its anticoagulant effect. The RE-VERSE AD trial (Pollack et al., 2017) demonstrated complete reversal of dabigatran within minutes in 100% of patients. Vitamin K (C) does not affect direct thrombin inhibitors. Prothrombin complex concentrate (D) has limited efficacy on dabigatran. Osmotic therapy (A) addresses cerebral edema but not coagulopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Anticoagulant-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is classified under ICD-11 MB61 \u2018Hemorrhage due to anticoagulants.\u2019 Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, increases ICH risk albeit lower than warfarin. Idarucizumab (Praxbind) was FDA-approved in 2015 for urgent dabigatran reversal. Knowledge of anticoagulant pharmacodynamics and reversal agents is essential in acute stroke care.","pathophysiology":"Dabigatran inhibits thrombin (factor IIa), preventing fibrin clot formation. In ICH, ongoing anticoagulation leads to hematoma expansion. Idarucizumab binds free and thrombin-bound dabigatran, neutralizing its effect and restoring thrombin activity, facilitating hemostasis. Unlike vitamin K, which rescues vitamin K\u2013dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X), idarucizumab directly targets the drug molecule.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients on dabigatran presenting with acute focal deficits and CT evidence of ICH have high risk of hematoma expansion, mortality up to 50%. Early identification within 6 hours is critical. Lab tests: elevated aPTT and thrombin time correlate with dabigatran activity; however, reversal should not await lab results in life-threatening bleeding.","diagnostic_approach":"Immediate noncontrast CT to confirm ICH. Assess anticoagulant type via history and medication list. Measure aPTT and diluted thrombin time if available (sensitivity 90%). Initiate idarucizumab emergently in all dabigatran-associated ICH. Prothrombin complex concentrate is recommended for factor Xa inhibitors only (AHA/ASA 2019, Class I).","management_principles":"Administer idarucizumab 5 g IV (two 2.5 g boluses). Monitor coagulation parameters post-infusion; normalization occurs within minutes. Concurrent management includes blood pressure control (<140 mmHg) per AHA/ASA guidelines (Class I), and neurosurgical evaluation for hematoma evacuation if indicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"After reversal, repeat CT at 6\u201324 hours to assess hematoma stability. Reevaluate need for anticoagulation after 4\u20136 weeks based on thromboembolic vs hemorrhagic risk. Outpatient follow-up with neurology and hematology to optimize long-term stroke prevention.","clinical_pearls":"1. Idarucizumab is the only specific dabigatran antidote; 2. PCCs are ineffective for direct thrombin inhibitors but used for factor Xa inhibitors; 3. Vitamin K has no role in dabigatran reversal; 4. Rapid BP control reduces hematoma expansion; 5. Do not delay reversal awaiting lab tests in life-threatening bleeding.","references":"1. Pollack CV Jr et al. Idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal.

Dissection. In young trauma patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion post-MVA and consequent ischemic infarcts, arterial dissection is the most common etiology. B. Thrombosis can cause ICA occlusion but is rare in healthy young individuals without atherosclerotic risk factors. C. Embolism from a cardiac source would produce an occlusion but typically without direct trauma. D. Atherosclerosis is extremely uncommon in young patients without risk factors and unlikely acutely post-MVA. Multiple cohort studies show that up to 80% of ICA occlusions in trauma are due to intimal tears and dissection (Biffl WL et al., 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Carotid artery dissection is classified under cervical artery dissections (ICD-11: 8A43.2). It arises from intimal tear causing intramural hematoma and luminal stenosis/occlusion. Differential includes thrombotic occlusion, embolic stroke, fibromuscular dysplasia. Embryologically, large arteries derive from neural crest; dissections often occur at areas of stress such as the carotid canal. Pathways: intimal tear \u2192 subintimal hematoma \u2192 arterial occlusion or pseudoaneurysm \u2192 distal ischemia.","pathophysiology":"Normal arterial wall consists of intima, media, adventitia. Trauma can cause intimal disruption, allowing blood to enter the media and form an intramural hematoma. This compresses the true lumen, leading to reduced antegrade flow or complete occlusion. Endothelial injury promotes thrombosis, which can further occlude the vessel. Inflammatory cascade and matrix metalloproteinase activation worsen vessel wall integrity.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms occur within hours to days post-injury: neck pain, headache, Horner syndrome (ipsilateral), ischemic stroke symptoms (hemiparesis, aphasia). In MVA patients, often delayed presentation up to 48 hours. DSA shows \u2018flame\u2010shaped\u2019 occlusion.

Ticagrelor is a direct-acting, reversible antagonist of the platelet P2Y12 ADP receptor. Multiple randomized trials (e.g., PLATO) demonstrated that ticagrelor reduces the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared with clopidogrel (hazard ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.75\u20130.93; P=0.002). Option A is incorrect because aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), not adenosine deaminase. Option C is wrong: apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct factor Xa inhibitors with no significant activity at thrombin\u2019s active site. Option D is false: clopidogrel is an irreversible P2Y12 receptor inhibitor and does not directly inhibit coagulation factors VII, X, XI, or XII.","conceptual_foundation":"Antithrombotic therapy in vascular neurology centers on two pathways: platelet aggregation (arterial thrombosis) and coagulation cascade (venous thrombosis). Platelet activation via ADP binding to P2Y12 receptors on the platelet surface amplifies aggregation. In the nosological framework, P2Y12 inhibitors (e.g., ticagrelor, clopidogrel, prasugrel) belong to antiplatelet agents in ICD-11 code LA82. Ticagrelor\u2019s reversible binding allows more rapid offset compared to irreversible thienopyridines. The P2Y12 receptor is a G protein\u2013coupled receptor (GPCR) that upon ADP binding triggers Gi signaling, reducing intracellular cAMP and promoting shape change and degranulation.","pathophysiology":"Normal hemostasis involves primary plug formation via platelet adhesion (via von Willebrand factor) and activation (via thrombin, collagen, ADP) followed by aggregation through fibrinogen bridges between activated GPIIb/IIIa receptors. ADP released from platelet dense granules binds P2Y12, stabilizing aggregates. Ticagrelor blocks this receptor, reducing Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase and keeping cAMP levels higher, thereby diminishing platelet responsiveness. In contrast, factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban) target the common pathway, and aspirin blocks TXA2\u2013mediated activation, which is a distinct mechanism.","clinical_manifestation":"In patients with acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack, early dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor reduces recurrent stroke risk by approximately 32% at 90\u2009days (CHANCE trial).

The most common adverse effect is dyspnea (up to 14%), attributed to adenosine uptake inhibition, and bleeding (major bleeding rates ~1\u20132%).","diagnostic_approach":"Platelet function assays (e.g., VerifyNow P2Y12 assay) can assess P2Y12 inhibition: ticagrelor achieves >80% inhibition of platelet aggregation within 2\u2009hours.

In suspected antiplatelet resistance, light transmission aggregometry remains the gold standard (sensitivity >90%, specificity ~85%).","management_principles":"The AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level of Evidence A) recommend dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 21\u2009days after minor stroke/TIA.
