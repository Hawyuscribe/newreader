Where is the lesion located in the brainstem?","options":["Two choices in medulla","Right rostral midbrain","Left rostral midbrain"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Right rostral midbrain","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B is correct. The trochlear nucleus is located in the dorsal midbrain at the level of the inferior colliculus. Fibers decussate before exiting dorsally; therefore, a lesion of the right rostral midbrain nucleus produces a left fourth nerve palsy. The compensatory head tilt is toward the right shoulder to minimize the extorsion and hypertropia of the left eye.","conceptual_foundation":"The CN IV nucleus lies ventral to the aqueduct, decussates in the superior medullary velum, and emerges contralaterally. Understanding its dorsal exit helps localize lesions: a nuclear lesion causes contralateral palsy, whereas a nerve fascicle lesion produces ipsilateral findings.","pathophysiology":"Lesion of the right nucleus interrupts fibers destined for the left superior oblique. Since the nerve decussates caudal to the nucleus, the deficit appears on the opposite side. The patient\u2019s head tilt to the right reduces the extorsion induced by the weak superior oblique muscle.","clinical_manifestation":"Left hypertropia that increases on right gaze and right head tilt (positive Bielschowsky test). Patients describe vertical diplopia and tilt their head toward the contralateral shoulder.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with thin slices through the dorsal midbrain to identify infarction, demyelination, or mass. Contrast enhances detection of small lesions near the aqueduct. No further testing if clinical localization is clear and risk factors for stroke or demyelination exist.","management_principles":"Address underlying cause: anticoagulation for stroke, steroids for inflammation. Prism correction or patching for symptomatic relief. Neurosurgical intervention if mass effect is present.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat imaging at 3\u20136 months if no improvement. Neurologic exam every 4\u20136 weeks. Monitor for additional brainstem signs.","clinical_pearls":"1. Trochlear nucleus lesions cause contralateral palsy due to decussation. 2. Head tilt is away from the side of the weak SO. 3. Dorsal exit of CN IV makes it susceptible to dorsal midbrain pathology. 4. Isolated nuclear lesions are rare\u2014look for other midbrain signs. 5.

A lesion of the right medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) impairs adduction of the right eye with dissociated nystagmus of the abducting left eye, characteristic of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). This finding localizes precisely to the ipsilateral MLF in the dorsal pons/midbrain junction.","conceptual_foundation":"The MLF interconnects the abducens nucleus contralaterally with the oculomotor nucleus, coordinating conjugate horizontal gaze. A focal lesion disrupts this connection, sparing convergence (which uses a separate pathway), leading to the INO clinical picture.","pathophysiology":"Demyelination (multiple sclerosis) in younger patients or microvascular ischemia in older adults often affects the MLF. Disruption of the internuclear fibers prevents transmission of the burst signal from the abducens to the medial rectus subnucleus.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report horizontal diplopia; examination shows impaired adduction on the ipsilateral side and nystagmus in the abducting contralateral eye. Convergence is intact, differentiating INO from third nerve palsy.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with FLAIR sequences through the brainstem to detect demyelinating lesions or small infarcts. VEPs and other evoked potentials may support MS diagnosis in younger patients.","management_principles":"Treat underlying cause: high-dose steroids for acute MS exacerbation or vascular risk factor control. Symptomatic prism or patching can be used. No specific therapy for MLF lesions beyond addressing etiology.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up every 4\u20138 weeks; repeat MRI if new neurologic signs develop. In MS, integrate into disease-modifying therapy monitoring.","clinical_pearls":"1. INO spares convergence. 2. Abducting nystagmus is a hallmark. 3. MLF lesions localize to dorsal tegmentum. 4.
