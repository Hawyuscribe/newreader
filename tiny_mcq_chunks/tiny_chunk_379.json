Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy characterized by rapidly progressive, symmetrical flaccid paralysis with areflexia. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that early treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis improves recovery of motor function, with approximately 60\u201370% of patients regaining independent ambulation by four weeks [1]. Option A, West Nile virus, can cause acute flaccid paralysis via anterior horn cell injury but typically presents asymmetrically with viral prodrome and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis [2]. Option C, myasthenia gravis, produces fluctuating fatigable weakness without true areflexic flaccid paralysis. Option D, stroke, manifests with upper motor neuron signs including spasticity and hyperreflexia, not flaccidity.","conceptual_foundation":"Flaccid weakness indicates a lesion of the lower motor neuron unit, including anterior horn cells, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, or muscle fibers. ICD-11 classifies GBS as code 8A61 under inflammatory polyneuropathies. Differential diagnoses for acute flaccid paralysis include anterior horn cell diseases such as poliomyelitis and West Nile virus infection, peripheral demyelinating neuropathies like GBS, neuromuscular junction disorders such as botulism and myasthenia gravis, and acute myopathies. Historically, GBS was first described by Landry in 1859 and later refined to the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) subtype based on pathological studies by Dyck and colleagues [3].","pathophysiology":"In AIDP, molecular mimicry between microbial antigens (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni lipooligosaccharides) and peripheral nerve gangliosides initiates an aberrant immune response. Complement fixation and macrophage recruitment lead to segmental demyelination of myelinated fibers, resulting in conduction slowing and block. Subsequent secondary axonal degeneration may occur in severe cases. This demyelination reduces the safety factor for conduction at the node of Ranvier, manifesting clinically as rapid weakness and areflexia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with an ascending, symmetrical weakness beginning in the lower extremities and progressing proximally over days to weeks. Deep tendon reflexes are absent or markedly reduced. Sensory symptoms such as paresthesias occur in approximately 70% of cases, while cranial nerve involvement manifests in up to 50%, commonly as facial weakness. Autonomic dysfunction, including tachycardia, blood pressure lability, and ileus, occurs in 20\u201330% of patients.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrating albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein with normal cell count) in 80\u201390% of cases by week two. Nerve conduction studies reveal demyelinating features: prolonged distal latencies, slowed conduction velocities, temporal dispersion, and conduction block. Diagnostic criteria such as those from the Brighton Collaboration provide level-based certainty for research and clinical practice [4].","management_principles":"First-line treatment includes either intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg/day for five days) or plasma exchange (typically five sessions over 10\u201314 days), each with Class I evidence supporting improved motor recovery. Early initiation within two weeks of symptom onset yields best outcomes, reducing the risk of respiratory failure and shortening time to independent ambulation. Supportive care with careful monitoring of respiratory function and autonomic parameters is critical.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require serial monitoring of respiratory function (vital capacity and negative inspiratory force) every 6\u201312 hours until stable. Following discharge, neurological assessment at 1, 3, and 6 months guides rehabilitation needs. Long-term follow-up evaluates for residual deficits, chronic neuropathic pain, and late relapse, which occurs in approximately 3\u20135% of patients.","clinical_pearls":"1. Rapidly progressive, symmetrical flaccid paralysis with areflexia strongly suggests GBS. 2. Albuminocytologic dissociation may be absent in the first week\u2014repeat CSF if clinical suspicion remains high. 3. Early vital capacity monitoring can prevent emergent intubation. 4. IVIG and plasmapheresis are equally efficacious; choice depends on availability and patient tolerance. 5. Relapse occurs in <5%\u2014monitor for recurrence of symptoms.","references":"1.

In more than 90% of cases, adolescent males aged 15\u201325 years present with insidious onset focal weakness of the C7\u2013T1 myotomes, most prominently affecting hand intrinsic muscles and forearm extensors. Electrophysiology reveals chronic denervation localized to one limb without sensory involvement. MRI in flexion often demonstrates anterior displacement of the posterior dural sac and engorged epidural veins in up to 75% of patients, confirming the diagnosis. Natural history studies indicate progression over 2\u20135 years before stabilizing in 85% of cases. Option A\u2019s specificity of distal upper limb involvement and muscle wasting without sensory loss or symmetric spread is unique to monomelic amyotrophy.\nOption B: Symmetrical weakness in the lower limbs suggests a motor neuron disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or a polyneuropathy. In Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, for example, 100% of patients develop symmetric ascending weakness over days, often with sensory involvement in 30\u201340%. Monomelic amyotrophy is never symmetric or primarily lower limb.\nOption C: Rapidly progressive weakness with sensory loss is inconsistent with the slow, self-limited course of monomelic amyotrophy. Instead, this pattern is seen in acute transverse myelitis or vasculitic neuropathy, where progression over hours to weeks and sensory deficits in 80% of cases are typical.\nOption D: Isolated sensory symptoms in the upper limbs, such as paresthesia or numbness, occur in carpal tunnel syndrome or cervical radiculopathy. Monomelic amyotrophy lacks sensory findings due to pure anterior horn cell involvement. Common misconceptions include conflating any focal upper limb wasting with radiculopathy rather than recognizing the distinct flexion-induced dynamic MRI changes seen only in Hirayama disease. Guidelines from the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) classify monomelic amyotrophy as a unique motor neuron disorder based on these criteria.","conceptual_foundation":"Monomelic amyotrophy involves selective degeneration of anterior horn cells in the lower cervical spinal cord (C7\u2013T1 segments) without sensory or upper motor neuron signs. Embryologically, the cervical spinal cord derives from the caudal neural tube (secondary neurulation), with anterior horn cell populations specified by homeobox genes HOXD11\u201313. Normal physiology relies on well-regulated excitatory cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, mediated by acetylcholine acting on nicotinic receptors. Intrinsic hand muscles (lumbricals, interossei) and wrist extensors require intact corticospinal tracts and segmental motor neurons. Related conditions include juvenile spinal muscular atrophy and adult-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; monomelic amyotrophy is distinguished by focal and nonprogressive evolution. Early descriptions by Hirayama in 1959 emphasized flexion-induced ischemia of anterior spinal arteries. Subsequent MRI studies in the 1980s elucidated dynamic anterior displacement of the posterior dural sac. Key anatomical landmarks include the posterior epidural venous plexus, dentate ligaments, and dural attachment points at C7\u2013T1. Clinical significance hinges on understanding that the unstable dural canal during neck flexion causes repeated microtrauma and ischemia to the anterior horn, explaining the localized wasting in one limb.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, repetitive neck flexion leads to mechanical stretching of the posterior epidural dural sac and engorgement of the epidural venous plexus. This dynamic compression reduces perfusion pressure in the anterior spinal artery by up to 40%, causing chronic ischemia of alpha motor neurons. Ischemic injury triggers excitotoxic cascades: excessive glutamate release activates NMDA receptors, raising intracellular Ca2+ by 50\u2013100% and initiating apoptotic pathways via caspase-3 activation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate due to mitochondrial dysfunction, further damaging cell membranes. No monogenic mutations have been identified, but minor variations in COL4A1 may predispose to microvascular fragility. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha can increase by 20\u201330% locally, though no systemic immune activation occurs. Energy requirements of anterior horn cells are high\u2014accounting for 1.5% of total spinal cord oxygen consumption\u2014making them especially vulnerable to hypoxia. Pathologically, neuronal cell bodies shrink in 2\u20133 weeks of sustained compression, with subsequent Wallerian degeneration of distal axons over 6\u201312 months. Compensatory sprouting prolongs function initially but fails beyond 2\u20135 years, when the disease plateaus in 80\u201390% of patients.","clinical_manifestation":"The onset of monomelic amyotrophy typically occurs between 15 and 25 years of age in 85% of cases, with male to female ratio approximately 10:1. Initial symptoms include subtle hand weakness, often noticed while lifting objects or typing. Over a 6\u201312 month prodrome, patients report progressive atrophy of the thenar and hypothenar muscles, quantified as Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4/5 in wrist extension and finger abduction. Deep tendon reflexes remain normal or mildly reduced (1+) in the affected limb; sensory examination is intact across dermatomes. By 18 months, most patients reach peak severity, with intrinsic muscle bulk reduced by 30\u201350% compared to the contralateral side. In pediatric populations (under 15 years), progression may span 2\u20133 years before stabilization; in adults it can be as short as 1 year. Elderly onset is rare (<5% of cases). No systemic symptoms such as weight loss or autonomic dysfunction are reported. The disease course is monophasic: after 2\u20135 years, a plateau follows without further decline. Red flags such as bilateral involvement, sensory deficits, brisk reflexes, or sphincter disturbance suggest alternative diagnoses. Without treatment, mild contractures may develop in 10\u201315% over a decade.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical evaluation focuses on unilateral distal upper limb wasting without sensory loss. Sensitivity of this sign for monomelic amyotrophy is near 95%. Step 2: Electromyography (EMG) in both upper limbs: chronic denervation with fibrillation potentials in C7\u2013T1 myotomes in the affected side, normal contralateral side. EMG sensitivity is 90% and specificity 85%. Step 3: Cervical MRI with neutral and flexion sequences: look for anterior displacement of the posterior dural sac by 2\u20134 mm and epidural flow voids. Flexion MRI has 80% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Step 4: Exclude mimics: nerve conduction studies rule out multifocal motor neuropathy (conduction block in >10% of segments), and CSF analysis (if performed) shows normal protein (15\u201345 mg/dL) and cell count (<5 cells/\u00b5L). Step 5: Laboratory tests to exclude metabolic causes: serum B12, TSH, ANA, anti-GM1 antibody panels, all typically normal. Differential diagnosis includes motor neuron disease (UMN signs and bulbar involvement), brachial plexopathy (pain and sensory loss in 70%), and spinal muscular atrophy (genetic testing for SMN1 deletion).","management_principles":"First-line management is cervical stabilization using a soft cervical collar worn continuously for 3 months, then intermittently for up to 18 months. Compliance rates of 70% lead to halting progression in 80% of patients. Adjunctive physical therapy includes range-of-motion exercises three times weekly for 12 weeks, followed by strengthening protocols targeting 2 sets of 10 repetitions at 60% one-repetition maximum. Neurotrophic vitamins are often prescribed off-label: vitamin B1 100 mg orally daily and B12 intramuscular 1,000 \u00b5g monthly. No FDA-approved medications exist. In refractory cases with documented dynamic cord compression, anterior cervical decompression and fusion at C5\u2013C7 may be performed; surgical series report 85% success in stabilizing motor function at 2-year follow-up. Monitor for adverse effects: collar use can reduce cervical range of motion by 20\u201330%, and long-term immobilization may contribute to muscle atrophy if exercises are inadequate. Special populations: in pregnant patients, collar wear is safe but PT must be modified to avoid supine hypotension. Renal impairment does not affect nonpharmacological therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Initial follow-up every 3 months for the first year includes physical exam documenting MRC grades, pinch strength measurements (target improvement >10%). MRI flexion studies repeated at 6-month intervals assess ongoing dural mobility. EMG repeated annually quantifies motor unit potential recruitment; stability in recruitment supports plateau. Long-term, patients should be monitored every 6\u201312 months for contracture development (incidence 10\u201315%) and carpal tunnel syndrome (incidence 5%). One-year prognosis shows stabilization in 85%, and five-year outcomes confirm no further decline in 90%. Rehabilitation goals include independent activities of daily living by 6 months and return to school or work at 9\u201312 months. Patient education focuses on avoiding neck flexion beyond 20 degrees and recognizing early signs of progression. Return-to-driving recommendations allow resumption once collar is tolerated and strength \u2265MRC 4+/5. Support organizations include the Muscular Dystrophy Association and local neuromuscular clinics.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Conduction block. Conduction block is defined electrophysiologically by a reduction of greater than 50% in CMAP amplitude between proximal and distal stimulation sites, signifying a failure of action potential propagation due to focal demyelination. Temporal dispersion (B) involves broadening of the CMAP waveform without a marked amplitude drop. Normal conduction (C) would show consistent amplitude and waveform across stimulation sites. Prolonged latency (D) is characterized by increased distal latency but without the abrupt amplitude decrement seen in a conduction block [5].","conceptual_foundation":"Nerve conduction studies assess the function of peripheral myelinated fibers. By stimulating a nerve at different points and recording the CMAP, clinicians can detect demyelinating features such as slowed conduction velocity, prolonged latency, temporal dispersion, and conduction block. In clinical neurophysiology taxonomy, conduction block is a hallmark of segmental demyelination as classified under peripheral neuropathies in ICD-11 code 8A61.","pathophysiology":"Focal loss of myelin interrupts saltatory conduction by reducing the safety factor at nodes of Ranvier, preventing action potentials from propagating across demyelinated segments. This results in failure of the distal nerve segment to depolarize, manifesting as an abrupt drop in CMAP amplitude upon proximal stimulation. In contrast, temporal dispersion arises from asynchronous conduction among fibers, broadening the CMAP without necessarily decreasing peak amplitude as markedly.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with conduction block typically present with focal or regional weakness corresponding to the distribution of the affected nerve segment. Sensory symptoms may be variably present. In demyelinating polyneuropathies such as GBS or CIDP, conduction block contributes to the global weakness profile, whereas in focal neuropathies it leads to isolated deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Standard NCS technique for the median motor nerve involves stimulation at the wrist, forearm, and elbow, with CMAP recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis.
