[{"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"HLTV1","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":"A 31-year-old woman with a subacute but progressively worsening spastic paraparesis, back pain, urinary incontinence and \u2018electrical\u2019 pain (Lhermitte\u2019s phenomenon), MRI showing patchy intramedullary T2 hyperintensities in the thoracic cord, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis in the absence of a positive viral PCR is most consistent with HTLV-1\u2013associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).\n\n1. Why HTLV-1 (Option B) is correct\n\nEpidemiology & clinical presentation\n\u2022 HTLV-1 is endemic in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean, parts of South America and sub-Saharan Africa. A history of travel from or residence in these regions should raise suspicion.  \n\u2022 Only 1\u20134% of those infected ever develop HAM/TSP, typically ages 40\u201350, but cases in the 30s are well documented.  \n\u2022 The onset is insidious, with slowly progressive stiffness (spasticity), gait disturbance, back pain, urinary urgency/incontinence and lower back \u2018\u2018electric shock\u2019\u2019 sensations down the legs.  \n\nPathophysiology\n\u2022 HTLV-1 is a human T-lymphotropic retrovirus that infects CD4+ T-cells. Viral antigens stimulate a chronic immune response targeting spinal cord antigens, especially in the thoracic region, resulting in axonal degeneration of corticospinal tracts and dorsal columns.  \n\u2022 Spinal cord atrophy and patchy demyelination manifest on MRI as multifocal T2 hyperintensities, particularly in mid-to-lower thoracic segments. Lesions tend to be asymmetric and non\u2013longitudinally extensive (typically <3 vertebral levels), distinguishing them from NMOSD.  \n\nCSF findings\n\u2022 Lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u201350 WBC/mm3), elevated protein and oligoclonal bands may be seen.  \n\u2022 Routine viral PCR panels (HSV, VZV, enterovirus) are negative. Definitive diagnosis is by HTLV-1 serology (ELISA followed by confirmatory Western blot or PCR for proviral DNA).  \n\nManagement pearls\n\u2022 No curative therapy; immunomodulatory approaches (corticosteroids, interferon-\u03b1) may slow progression.  \n\u2022 Early recognition and supportive measures (spasticity management, bladder care, physical therapy) optimize quality of life.\n\n2. Why the other options are incorrect\n\nOption A: Vascular myelopathy (spinal cord infarction)\n\u2022 Typical onset is hyperacute (minutes to hours), often with severe pain and distinct sensory level, followed by flaccid paraplegia evolving into spasticity.  \n\u2022 MRI shows \u2018\u2018owl\u2019s eyes\u2019\u2019 sign (bilateral anterior horn T2 hyperintensity) or wedge-shaped infarct, not patchy lesions.  \n\u2022 CSF is usually acellular or shows mild protein elevation without pleocytosis.\n\nOption C: Lymphoma (primary intramedullary spinal cord lymphoma)\n\u2022 Presents subacutely but usually as a solitary expansile intramedullary mass with homogeneous or ring enhancement on MRI.  \n\u2022 CSF may reveal malignant lymphoid cells or markedly elevated protein.  \n\u2022 Systemic \u2018B\u2019 symptoms or mass lesions elsewhere are often present. Travel history is irrelevant.\n\nOption D: NMOSD (Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder)\n\u2022 Typically causes longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) spanning \u22653 vertebral segments with central cord involvement, not patchy focal lesions.  \n\u2022 Patients often have optic neuritis or area postrema syndrome.  \n\u2022 Aquaporin-4 or MOG antibodies are diagnostic. CSF pleocytosis can occur but usually with a higher cell count and strong contrast enhancement. Travel history is not a risk factor.\n\n3. Key learning points & clinical pearls\n\u2022 HTLV-1 should be suspected in slowly progressive spastic paraparesis, especially with bladder dysfunction and Lhermitte\u2019s signs, in patients from endemic areas.  \n\u2022 Distinguish HAM/TSP (patchy, mid-thoracic lesions) from LETM of NMOSD (contiguous \u22653 levels) and from infarcts (\u2018\u2018owl\u2019s eyes,\u2019\u2019 acute onset).  \n\u2022 CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis + MRI findings + negative standard viral panel \u2192 test HTLV-1 serology.  \n\u2022 Early multidisciplinary management (neurorehabilitation, spasticity control, bladder training) is critical as no curative therapy exists.\n\nReferences\n1.

In this immunosuppressed SLE patient on steroids and dialysis, the CSF profile (120 cells, elevated protein) and high-grade fever strongly favor HSV encephalitis. SLE cerebritis generally lacks pronounced fever and shows more variable CSF findings; PRES requires significant hypertension and characteristic MRI findings; cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) may present with headache and seizures but rarely causes high-grade fever or isolated lymphocytic pleocytosis without hemorrhage on imaging.","conceptual_foundation":"HSV-1 is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in adults. After primary infection, HSV-1 remains latent in trigeminal ganglia and can reactivate, traveling along sensory nerves to the temporal lobes. The resultant necrotizing inflammation produces characteristic clinical and radiographic findings: fever, neuropsychiatric symptoms, focal seizures, and T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the medial temporal lobes. CSF typically shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose, and mildly elevated protein. Definitive diagnosis relies on HSV DNA detection by PCR.","pathophysiology":"Reactivation of latent HSV-1 in trigeminal ganglia leads to retrograde axonal transport into the brain. Viral replication in neurons causes direct cytopathic damage, neuronal death, and hemorrhagic necrosis. The host inflammatory response\u2014mediated by microglia, T cells, and pro-inflammatory cytokines\u2014exacerbates tissue injury. Blood\u2013brain barrier disruption permits lymphocytic infiltration, yielding the CSF pleocytosis observed.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset over 1\u20135 days with fever often >38.5 \u00b0C, headache, confusion, memory deficits, behavioral changes, and focal seizures.

Pathologic hallmark includes lipofuscin storage in neurons and other cells. Gaucher disease (A) involves glucocerebroside accumulation, presenting with hepatosplenomegaly, bone crises, and neuronopathic forms (Type 2 and 3) but not classic myoclonic epilepsy. \u201cCalven disease\u201d (B) is not a recognized entity; likely a distractor. NCL encompasses several genetic forms (e.g., CLN1, CLN2) with myoclonus, seizures, and progressive neurodegeneration.

Differential includes other storage disorders: Gaucher, Tay-Sachs, GM2 gangliosidosis, but NCL uniquely exhibits autofluorescent lipopigment accumulation. Historically, NCL was first described by Otto Christian Stengel in 1826, with genetic loci CLN1\u2013CLN14 identified over the last three decades.","pathophysiology":"Mutations in genes encoding lysosomal enzymes or membrane proteins (e.g., PPT1 in CLN1, TPP1 in CLN2) impair degradation of ceroid-lipofuscin, leading to neuronal accumulation, synaptic dysfunction, and cell death. Lipofuscin is an autofluorescent aggregate of proteins and lipids secondary to oxidative damage. The buildup triggers microglial activation, excitotoxicity, and neuronal apoptosis, manifesting clinically as seizures and cognitive decline.","clinical_manifestation":"Presentation varies by CLN subtype but often involves normal development until 2\u20135 years, followed by cognitive regression, myoclonic seizures, visual decline, and hypotonia.

Chromosomal analysis (more precisely, molecular genetic testing of the FMR1 gene) is the diagnostic test of choice for fragile X syndrome, detecting the CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. Guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics (2014) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (2016) recommend PCR and Southern blot analysis of FMR1, which is often grouped under chromosomal analysis in examination questions. Option A (\u2018Inherited anti-psychiatric test\u2019) is fictitious and has no basis in genetic diagnostics. Option B (metabolic test) is incorrect because fragile X is a nucleotide repeat expansion disorder, not a metabolic enzyme deficiency.","conceptual_foundation":"Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by CGG repeat expansion (>200 repeats) in the FMR1 gene on Xq27.3, leading to methylation and transcriptional silencing. In ICD-11 it is classified under 6A00.3 (Fragile X syndrome). Related disorders include FMR1 premutation carriers (55\u2013200 repeats) who may develop fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. Embryologically, FMRP is critical for synaptic maturation during neurodevelopment. Neuroanatomically, loss of FMRP leads to dendritic spine dysmorphogenesis in hippocampus and cortex.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the FMR1 gene encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that represses translation of synaptic mRNAs, regulating synaptic plasticity. CGG expansion >200 induces hypermethylation of the FMR1 promoter, abolishing FMRP production. The resulting dysregulated protein synthesis disrupts synaptic development, causing intellectual disability, autism spectrum features, and behavioral problems.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in early childhood with developmental delay, intellectual disability (mild to severe), speech delay, hyperactivity, and autistic behaviors (60\u201370%). Post-puberty, males exhibit macroorchidism (>95% of adult males). Facial features (long face, large ears) become more apparent with age. Premutation carriers may be asymptomatic or develop FXTAS in later life.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier diagnostic testing is PCR and Southern blot analysis of FMR1 to determine CGG repeat number and methylation status. PCR alone detects repeats up to ~150; Southern blot confirms full mutations. Sensitivity and specificity exceed 99%. Conventional karyotyping can sometimes reveal a folate-sensitive fragile site but is no longer recommended due to low sensitivity and resolution.","management_principles":"There is no cure; management is multidisciplinary.

Epidural hematoma. In a lucid interval scenario\u2014initial loss of consciousness, a subsequent period of apparent recovery lasting up to one to several hours, followed by rapid neurological deterioration\u2014epidural hematoma is classic. Epidural hematomas arise from arterial bleeding (usually middle meningeal artery) between the dura and skull. CT imaging typically shows a biconvex (lentiform), hyperdense collection that does not cross suture lines. Subdural hematomas (B) develop from venous bleeding (bridging veins), present more insidiously over hours to days, and on CT appear as crescent-shaped collections that may cross sutures. Concussion (C) involves transient functional disturbance without focal structural damage and does not produce a lucid interval or expanding intracranial collection. Intracerebral hemorrhage (D) refers to bleeding within brain parenchyma and presents with focal deficits, headache, or altered mental status but lacks a classic lucid interval pattern.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding epidural hematoma requires knowledge of cranial meningeal anatomy and biomechanics of head trauma. The skull is lined internally by the dura mater, beneath which lie the arachnoid and pia mater. The middle meningeal artery runs in grooves on the inner aspect of the temporal bone; a temporal bone fracture can lacerate this vessel, causing rapid arterial bleeding into the epidural space. The high-pressure arterial flow initially compresses the underlying brain but may temporarily tamponade; when pressure builds enough, consciousness is lost. In contrast, bridging veins cross the subdural space; venous bleeding is slower, leading to more delayed presentations. Clinically, children have more pliable skulls and are prone to skull fractures and epidural bleeds after falls.","pathophysiology":"Normal intracranial hemostasis depends on intact meningeal vessels and autoregulatory cerebral blood flow. In epidural hematoma, traumatic skull fracture lacerates the middle meningeal artery. Arterial bleeding into the epidural compartment increases local intracranial pressure (ICP) rapidly, compressing cortical tissue and reducing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP \u2013 ICP). Initially, transient compensation may occur via CSF displacement and venous outflow, producing a lucid interval. Once compensatory reserve is exhausted, ICP rises precipitously, causing herniation syndromes (uncal herniation), pupillary dilation, hemiparesis, and coma. Cellular ischemia, excitotoxicity, and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption follow.","clinical_manifestation":"Presentation typically includes a brief loss of consciousness at injury, a lucid interval of minutes to hours, then progressive headache, vomiting, confusion, focal neurologic signs (e.g., contralateral hemiparesis), and ipsilateral fixed and dilated pupil from oculomotor nerve compression. In pediatric patients, irritability, lethargy, seizures, and bulging fontanelle (in infants) may occur. Without treatment, rapid deterioration to coma and death ensues.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast head CT is first-line: demonstrates a biconvex, hyperdense lentiform collection abutting the skull, often with underlying skull fracture. CT sensitivity and specificity for acute epidural hematoma exceed 90%. In resource-limited settings, emergent transfer for imaging is critical. MRI is less practical acutely. Serial neurological exams, including Glasgow Coma Scale scoring and pupillary checks every 15\u201330 minutes, guide urgency.","management_principles":"Epidural hematomas causing mass effect or midline shift >5 mm, thickness >1 cm, or declining neurological status require emergent neurosurgical evacuation via craniotomy or burr holes. Small, asymptomatic collections (<30 mL, <5 mm thickness) may be observed in the ICU with serial CT and exams. Supportive measures: head elevation, hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV), hyperventilation (PaCO2 30\u201335 mm Hg) until surgery. Prophylactic anticonvulsants (e.g., levetiracetam) may be considered for 7 days.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperatively, monitor in a neurocritical care unit with hourly neurological assessments, ICP monitoring if placed, daily head CT until stable, and rehabilitation planning.
