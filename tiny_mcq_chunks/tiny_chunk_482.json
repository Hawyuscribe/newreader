[{"question_number":"2","question":"What is the recommendation for NSAID use in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy?","options":["It is safe to use","It should be avoided due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus","It is the first-line treatment","It can be used if other medications fail"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"It should be avoided due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase, reducing prostaglandin synthesis which maintains patency of the fetal ductus arteriosus. In the third trimester, NSAID use (including ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin) is associated with premature ductal closure (RR 3.5, 95% CI 1.8\u20136.8) and oligohydramnios. Option A is incorrect; NSAIDs are not safe in late pregnancy. Option C is incorrect; NSAIDs are not first-line in any trimester for migraine in pregnancy. Option D is incorrect; they are not recommended even as a second choice in the third trimester because of fetal risks.","conceptual_foundation":"Placental physiology relies on prostaglandins for fetal circulation; COX inhibition crosses the placenta. Migraines in pregnancy follow ICHD-3 classification without secondary cause. Understanding NSAID pharmacokinetics in pregnancy shows prolonged half-life in the third trimester. Differential for headache in late pregnancy includes preeclampsia and venous sinus thrombosis, where NSAIDs might obscure diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes produce prostaglandin E2, essential to keep the ductus arteriosus open. NSAID inhibition in the fetus leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and shunting reversal. Oligohydramnios arises from reduced fetal renal perfusion secondary to prostaglandin blockade. These effects manifest hours to days after maternal ingestion of NSAIDs.","clinical_manifestation":"Fetal ductal constriction may present antenatally as right ventricular hypertrophy and tricuspid regurgitation on fetal echocardiography. Newborns may have pulmonary hypertension requiring NICU management. Oligohydramnios predisposes to cord compression, growth restriction, and labor complications.","diagnostic_approach":"Avoid NSAIDs after 30 weeks GA. If exposure occurs, perform targeted fetal echocardiogram to assess ductal flow and amniotic fluid index. Monitor amniotic fluid levels by ultrasound weekly. If ductal constriction is detected, discontinue NSAIDs and consider prostaglandin E1 infusion.","management_principles":"Strict avoidance of NSAIDs in the third trimester. If acute analgesia is needed, use acetaminophen. For severe refractory migraine after simple analgesics, consider sumatriptan under obstetric supervision. Counsel on nonpharmacologic strategies. In cases of inadvertent NSAID use, monitor fetal well-being.","follow_up_guidelines":"After NSAID exposure, serial ultrasounds to monitor amniotic fluid and fetal Dopplers. If oligohydramnios develops, implement maternal hydration and consider amnioinfusion only in severe cases. Coordinate care with maternal\u2013fetal medicine.","clinical_pearls":"1. NSAIDs cause fetal ductal constriction in trimester 3\u2014avoid. 2. Even single doses of indomethacin can trigger oligohydramnios. 3. Acetaminophen remains safe alternative. 4. Fetal echo is indicated after third-trimester NSAID exposure. 5. Educate patients that 'over-the-counter' does not equal safe in late pregnancy.","references":"1. Koren G, et al.

Evidence-based guidelines (AAN 2019) recommend beginning migraine management in pregnancy with non-pharmacologic measures and simple analgesics such as acetaminophen, regardless of attack severity, before advancing to stronger therapies. Option A (NSAIDs) is incorrect due to fetal risks in later trimesters. Option C (triptans) is reserved for rescue after simple analgesia fails. Option D (opioids) carries maternal and fetal risks and is not an initial approach.","conceptual_foundation":"Initial management emphasizes safety: nonpharmacologic strategies (hydration, rest, relaxation) plus acetaminophen. ICHD-3 criteria guide diagnosis but not treatment order. Understanding that even severe migraines may respond to simple analgesics in pregnancy reduces unnecessary exposure to higher-risk drugs. Triage of therapies follows a stepwise \u2018ladder\u2019 model.","pathophysiology":"Migraine pain arises from trigeminovascular system activation and cortical spreading depression. Acetaminophen modulates central pain pathways by inhibiting central COX and serotonergic descending pathways. Using simple analgesics first targets initial nociceptive transmission with minimal fetal risk. Triptans and NSAIDs add vascular or systemic effects that carry additional risks.","clinical_manifestation":"Pregnant migraineurs may have unchanged or ameliorated attack frequency. Nevertheless, when attacks occur, simple analgesia aborts mild to moderate episodes in approximately 70% of cases. Early simple analgesic use prevents progression to severe pain, reducing need for rescue medications.","diagnostic_approach":"Confirm migraine diagnosis per ICHD-3. Assess red flags (neurologic deficits, hypertension) to exclude secondary causes. Baseline labs and BP monitoring rule out preeclampsia. No imaging if typical presentation. Trial of acetaminophen first, with patient diary to track efficacy.","management_principles":"Implement nonpharmacologic measures (sleep hygiene, hydration, relaxation) and acetaminophen 650 mg q6h prn.

Dexamethasone is not indicated for routine acute migraine management.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine without aura is classified under episodic primary headache disorders in ICD-11. Pathophysiology involves cortical spreading depression, trigeminovascular activation, and neurogenic inflammation. Differential includes tension-type headache, preeclampsia-related headache, and secondary causes.","pathophysiology":"Migraine pain arises from activation of trigeminal afferents innervating meningeal blood vessels, release of CGRP, substance P, and neuroinflammation.

Sumatriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D agonist, is FDA pregnancy category C and has been widely used in pregnancy for acute migraine rescue, including status migrainosus. Prospective registry data (Tepper et al., Headache 2012) show no significant increase in congenital malformations in first\u2010trimester exposure compared to population baseline (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.76\u20131.40). In contrast, IV valproate (Option A) is teratogenic (neural tube defects >10%; AAN 2018 Practice Parameter, Level A evidence) and contraindicated. Dihydroergotamine (Option B) is ergot alkaloid category X, associated with uterine vasoconstriction and fetal demise (AHS Guidelines 2015). Steroid use (Option D) such as dexamethasone may abort status migrainosus in nonpregnant patients but carries risks of orofacial clefts and maternal hyperglycemia when used in first trimester (Obstet Gynecol 2013), making it second-line only after failed triptans and antiemetics.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of moderate to severe headache associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Status migrainosus is defined by ICHD-3 as a migraine attack lasting more than 72 hours. In pregnancy, migraine often improves in the second trimester due to hormonal stabilization, but status migrainosus remains an emergency requiring safe acute therapy. Sumatriptan, by activating presynaptic 5-HT1D receptors on trigeminal afferents, inhibits release of CGRP and other vasoactive peptides, aborting the migraine cascade. Pregnant patients require medications with minimal teratogenic risk (FDA Category B or C). Understanding maternal\u2013fetal pharmacokinetics and placental transfer is essential for safe drug selection.","pathophysiology":"Normal trigeminovascular physiology involves activation of trigeminal afferents innervating dura mater, release of vasoactive neuropeptides (CGRP, substance P), and vasodilation of meningeal vessels. In migraine, cortical spreading depression and brainstem activation sensitize trigeminal nociceptors. Sumatriptan\u2019s vasoconstrictive action via 5-HT1B receptors on meningeal vessels and inhibition of neuropeptide release via 5-HT1D on presynaptic terminals restores homeostasis. In pregnancy, estrogen fluctuations modulate CGRP receptor expression, but key molecular targets remain responsive to triptans.","clinical_manifestation":"Status migrainosus presents as intractable, throbbing, unilateral headache often with associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia lasting more than 72 hours. In pregnant patients, dehydration and electrolyte disturbances from vomiting can exacerbate severity. Physical exam is unremarkable aside from photophobia and sometimes mild nuchal tenderness; neurologic deficits should prompt secondary headache evaluation.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical per ICHD-3 criteria. Initial evaluation includes history to exclude secondary causes, basic labs to assess dehydration and electrolytes, and consider MRI if red flags (e.g., focal deficits) are present. No special imaging is routine in uncomplicated status migrainosus in pregnancy.","management_principles":"First-line acute therapy in pregnancy is subcutaneous sumatriptan (6 mg), repeatable once after 1 hour (AHS Guidelines 2015, Level B). Adjunctive antiemetics (metoclopramide, Category B) are recommended to improve absorption. IV hydration and electrolyte repletion are critical. Corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg IV) may be considered after failure of triptans and antiemetics, preferably in the second trimester onward (ACOG 2017). Ergot derivatives and valproate are strictly contraindicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"After resolution, obstetric follow-up should assess fetal growth and well-being. Headache diary and preventive strategies (e.g., lifestyle, magnesium supplementation Category A) can reduce recurrence. Monitor for rebound headache if analgesic overuse occurs. Coordinate care with obstetrics for medication safety surveillance.","clinical_pearls":"1. Sumatriptan is the only triptan with subcutaneous formulation safe in pregnancy. 2. Always administer IV hydration before steroids to avoid maternal hyperglycemia. 3. Ergotamines are strictly contraindicated in pregnancy (Category X). 4. Status migrainosus requires antiemetics to ensure drug absorption. 5. Preventive supplements such as magnesium 400 mg daily are safe and effective in pregnancy.","references":["1.

Topical corticosteroids are first-line therapy for localized alopecia areata patches that can present with scalp tenderness or trichodynia. Randomized trials and expert consensus (Messenger et al. Br J Dermatol. 2012) demonstrate regrowth rates up to 60% with high\u2010potency topical steroids applied twice daily for 6\u201312 weeks. Option A (Gabapentin) is used for neuropathic pain but has no role in inflammatory scalp conditions and lacks efficacy data in alopecia areata. Option B (Local anesthesia) provides transient analgesia but does not address the underlying autoimmune inflammation. Option D (Oral analgesics) may reduce pain but again fails to treat hair follicle autoimmunity or promote regrowth.","conceptual_foundation":"Alopecia areata is a non-scarring, autoimmune-mediated hair loss disorder classified under ICD-11 EA20.1. Trichodynia refers to scalp pain or dysesthesia often accompanying active inflammatory hair loss. Differential includes tinea capitis, telogen effluvium, and lichen planopilaris. Understanding hair follicle immune privilege breakdown and peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrates is key. Historically, management evolved from systemic steroids to targeted topical regimens to minimize systemic side effects.","pathophysiology":"In alopecia areata, CD8+ T-cells target hair follicle bulb melanocytes and keratinocytes, driven by IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 cytokine release. This collapse of immune privilege leads to anagen arrest and hair shedding. Topical corticosteroids downregulate inflammatory gene expression via glucocorticoid receptor\u2013mediated transcriptional repression of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 pathways, restoring follicular immune homeostasis over weeks.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with one or more round or oval bald patches with exclamation-mark hairs at the periphery. Trichodynia occurs in up to 20% of cases, described as burning or itching. Nail pitting may coexist. Children and adults are equally affected; spontaneous remission occurs in ~50% within one year.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical. Dermoscopy shows yellow dots, black dots, and broken hairs. Scalp biopsy (second-tier) reveals peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate. Fungal studies rule out tinea capitis.
