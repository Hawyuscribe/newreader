[{"question_number":"3","question":"A female patient presents with a headache and occasional blurring of vision when leaning forward. She has papilledema but no visual field defects or decrease in visual acuity. This presentation is suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). What is the most appropriate treatment?","options":["Oral prednisone","IV methylprednisolone","Weight loss","Optic nerve fenestration"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Weight loss","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option C (Weight loss) is the most appropriate first-line treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Multiple studies demonstrate that modest weight reduction (5\u201310% of body weight) leads to significant reductions in intracranial pressure and improvement in papilledema and headache symptoms. For example, Wall et al. (2015) showed a 20% reduction in cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure with a 6% weight loss (Am J Ophthalmol. 2015;160(6):1078\u20131084). In contrast, options A and B (oral prednisone and IV methylprednisolone) are corticosteroids that have no proven long-term benefit in IIH and carry risks of weight gain and metabolic adverse effects (Mollan et al., 2018). Optic nerve fenestration (option D) is reserved for patients with progressive vision loss despite maximal medical therapy, not for those without field defects or acuity loss.","conceptual_foundation":"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of mass lesions or hydrocephalus. According to the revised Dandy criteria (Friedman & Jacobson, 2002), diagnosis requires papilledema, normal neuroimaging, increased CSF opening pressure (>25 cm H\u2082O), and normal CSF composition. IIH predominantly affects overweight women of childbearing age, with risk factors including obesity, certain medications (e.g., tetracyclines, vitamin A derivatives), and endocrine disorders. Weight reduction directly targets a key pathophysiological driver: adiposity-related alterations in CSF absorption.","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF dynamics involve production by the choroid plexus and absorption via arachnoid granulations. In IIH, proposed mechanisms include increased resistance to CSF outflow and elevated central venous pressure due to obesity-related intracranial venous hypertension. Adipose tissue may secrete inflammatory cytokines and hormones (e.g., leptin, adiponectin) that alter CSF physiology. Weight loss reduces intra-abdominal and thoracic pressure, improving venous return and lowering intracranial venous pressure, thereby enhancing CSF absorption and reducing intracranial pressure.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with daily or near-daily headaches that worsen with Valsalva maneuvers, positional changes, and ambient noise. Visual symptoms include transient visual obscurations (\u201cgraying out\u201d or blurring) on standing or bending, with pulsatile tinnitus in up to 60% of cases. Papilledema is universally present if visual symptoms exist. Visual field testing often shows enlarged blind spots before acuity loss occurs. Without intervention, patients risk permanent optic nerve atrophy and vision loss.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes neuroimaging (MRI/MR venography) to exclude mass lesions and venous sinus thrombosis. Confirmatory lumbar puncture demonstrates elevated opening pressure with normal CSF composition. Visual field perimetry is essential for baseline assessment. Second-tier tests include optical coherence tomography (OCT) for quantitative measurement of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Monitoring protocols require serial visual fields and papilledema grading every 3\u20136 months.","management_principles":"Weight loss through diet and exercise is the cornerstone of management, with supervised programs achieving sustained benefits. Acetazolamide (1\u20134 g/day) is the first-line pharmacotherapy, reducing CSF production by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase (Class I evidence, Level A recommendation). Second-line agents include topiramate, which has mild carbonic anhydrase inhibition and weight loss properties. Surgical interventions (CSF shunting or optic nerve fenestration) are reserved for patients with progressive visual decline despite medical therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require ophthalmologic evaluation with visual acuity, fields, and fundus examination every 1\u20133 months initially, then every 6 months once stable. Serial OCT every 6 months tracks axonal loss. Adjustment of acetazolamide dose is based on tolerance and efficacy. Long-term follow-up focuses on weight maintenance and monitoring for medication side effects (paresthesias, nephrolithiasis).","clinical_pearls":"1. Weight reduction of 5\u201310% can halve ICP in IIH. 2. Acetazolamide is the only medication with Class I evidence. 3. Transient visual obscurations are a warning of papilledema. 4. Optic nerve fenestration is reserved for severe vision loss. 5. Monitor serum electrolytes for acetazolamide-induced metabolic acidosis.","references":"1. Friedman DI, Jacobson DM.

Foster Kennedy syndrome is defined by ipsilateral optic atrophy and contralateral papilledema due to a mass lesion compressing one optic nerve while raising intracranial pressure. A right frontal lesion abutting the right optic nerve leads to right optic atrophy and generalized increased ICP causes left papilledema. Option B (Left frontal mass) would produce the opposite pattern, not observed in this syndrome.","conceptual_foundation":"Foster Kennedy syndrome belongs to compressive optic neuropathies in neuro-ophthalmic nosology. In ICD-11, it is coded under '8B00 Compressive optic neuropathy'. Differential includes unilateral optic glioma with pseudotumor cerebri. Originally described in the early 20th century by Robert Foster and William Kennedy, it illustrates local compression plus global pressure effects.","pathophysiology":"A frontal lobe tumor on the right compresses the right optic nerve, halting axoplasmic flow and causing atrophy. Concurrently, the mass raises intracranial pressure, transmitting via CSF around the left optic nerve sheath, producing papilledema. The anatomic proximity of the frontal lobe to the ipsilateral optic canal explains lateralization.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with progressive visual loss on the side of the lesion (due to optic atrophy) and headaches, nausea, or papilledema signs contralaterally. On fundus exam: right optic disc pallor, left disc swelling. Other frontal signs like personality changes may coexist.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: neuroimaging with MRI brain with contrast to localize frontal mass and assess optic nerve compression (sensitivity ~95%). Ophthalmic examination with fundus photography. Second-tier: optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify RNFL thickness (atrophy vs. edema). Third-tier: visual evoked potentials may show delayed P100 on the atrophic side.","management_principles":"Management focuses on tumor resection or debulking to relieve compression and ICP control. Corticosteroids reduce peritumoral edema. Follow NCCN guidelines for specific tumor type. Ophthalmic monitoring guides visual prognosis.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI at 3 months, then annually. Serial OCT and visual field testing every 6 months to monitor optic nerve recovery or progression. ICP monitoring if papilledema persists.","clinical_pearls":"1. Ipsilateral optic atrophy + contralateral papilledema = Foster Kennedy syndrome. 2. Always image frontal lobes in unexplained unilateral optic atrophy. 3. Differentiate from pseudo-Foster Kennedy (sequential optic neuritis) by imaging. 4. Early decompression may reverse papilledema but not established atrophy. 5. OCT can distinguish edema (thick RNFL) from atrophy (thinned RNFL).","references":"1. Plant GT. Foster Kennedy syndrome: clinicopathological features.

In adults presenting with an isolated fourth nerve palsy, microvascular ischemia (often related to diabetes or hypertension) is the most frequent cause, accounting for approximately 45\u201360% of cases in large clinical series (Kupersmith et al. 1992; Lee et al. 2002). Congenital palsies are often discovered later but are less common presentations in older adults, and trauma accounts for 10\u201315% of cases. Trauma typically produces additional findings and history of head injury, whereas microvascular palsies present acutely without other neurologic signs.","conceptual_foundation":"The trochlear nerve (CN IV) innervates the superior oblique muscle, producing depression and intorsion of the globe. It has the longest intracranial course and a narrow vessel supply making it vulnerable to ischemic injury. Isolated palsy leads to vertical diplopia, typically worse on downgaze. Differential includes compressive lesions (mass, aneurysm) and demyelination, but in older patients with vascular risk factors, microvascular ischemia predominates.","pathophysiology":"Microvascular ischemia in CN IV results from occlusion of small vasa nervorum, leading to focal axonal injury and demyelination. The long intracranial course and minimal collateral supply make the nerve susceptible to hyperglycemia- or hypertension-induced endothelial damage, platelet aggregation, and reduced perfusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report vertical or oblique diplopia worse on contralateral gaze and downgaze; they often tilt the head toward the shoulder opposite the lesion to minimize diplopia. Examination shows hypertropia of the affected side, increased on contralateral gaze and ipsilateral head tilt (positive Bielschowsky head tilt test).","diagnostic_approach":"In patients over age 50 with vascular risk factors and isolated CN IV palsy, clinical diagnosis is sufficient; MRI is reserved for atypical features (pain, other cranial nerve involvement, progressive palsy) per AAN guidelines. No routine imaging is required if the palsy improves over 3 months.","management_principles":"Supportive care with prism lenses or occlusion; reassurance as microvascular palsies typically recover spontaneously within 2\u20133 months. Control of diabetes and hypertension is essential. No specific pharmacotherapy accelerates recovery.","follow_up_guidelines":"Re-examine at 6\u20138 weeks to confirm improvement; if no recovery or if new neurologic signs appear, obtain MRI with attention to the brainstem and cavernous sinus. Monitor vascular risk factors in the long term.","clinical_pearls":"1. Most isolated CN IV palsies in adults with diabetes/hypertension are microvascular. 2. Head tilt toward the opposite shoulder compensates for SO weakness. 3. CN IV is the only nerve exiting dorsally, predisposing it to stretch injury. 4. Recovery is expected in 8\u201312 weeks without intervention. 5. Atypical features warrant imaging (pain, multiple nerve involvement).","references":"1. Kupersmith MJ et al.

Post\u2013bariatric surgery patients can develop copper deficiency leading to a myeloneuropathy with posterior column involvement (loss of proprioception) and corticospinal tract signs (spasticity). Normal B12 and methylmalonic acid levels exclude vitamin B12 deficiency (Option B). Zinc deficiency (Option A) can exacerbate copper loss but does not directly cause this myelopathy. Folate deficiency (Option D) typically presents with megaloblastic anemia rather than a combined myelopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Copper is an essential cofactor for enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase and superoxide dismutase. Deficiency leads to demyelination of the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts, akin to B12 deficiency but without elevated methylmalonic acid. In ICD-11, nutritional copper deficiency is coded under EN23. Historical recognition includes \u2018swayback\u2019 disease in sheep.","pathophysiology":"Copper deficiency disrupts mitochondrial electron transport (via cytochrome c oxidase) and antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase), leading to oxidative damage and demyelination in spinal cord tracts.
