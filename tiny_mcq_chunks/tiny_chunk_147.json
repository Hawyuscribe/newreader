What would you expect to find in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?","options":["Red blood cells and lymphocytic pleocytosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Red blood cells and lymphocytic pleocytosis","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. Red blood cells and lymphocytic pleocytosis. HSV-1 encephalitis classically produces temporal lobe MRI hyperintensities and CSF findings of lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated red blood cells due to hemorrhagic necrosis (Granerod et al., 2010; Tunkel et al., 2008). CSF RBC counts often exceed 1000 cells/mm\u00b3, and lymphocytic pleocytosis ranges from 10\u2013500 cells/mm\u00b3. Alternatives (neutrophilic pleocytosis without RBCs) are typical in bacterial meningitis and not in HSV encephalitis.","conceptual_foundation":"HSV encephalitis is an acute viral infection of the central nervous system, classified under ICD-11: 1D80. Differential diagnoses include varicella\u2010zoster, CMV, autoimmune encephalitis, and limbic encephalitis. Embryologically, temporal lobes derive from telencephalon; viral tropism for limbic structures underlies symptomatology. The condition arises from reactivation of latent virus in trigeminal ganglia with anterograde axonal transport to the brain.","pathophysiology":"Normal CNS is protected by the BBB. HSV-1 invades via trigeminal or olfactory nerves, leading to focal necrosis in temporal lobes. Viral replication triggers cytolysis, hemorrhage, and inflammatory infiltrates. Lymphocytes predominate, and capillary leakage leads to RBCs in CSF. Viral DNA detection by PCR has sensitivity 96% and specificity 99% within 72 hours of symptom onset (Aurangzeb et al., 2021).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop fever (85%), headache (60%), focal neurologic deficits (50%), altered mental status (70%), and seizures (40%) (Granerod et al., 2010). Time course is acute over 2\u20134 days. A prodrome of upper respiratory symptoms may precede neurologic signs. Without treatment, mortality approaches 70%; with acyclovir, mortality falls to 20% (ICU trial data).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI with FLAIR and diffusion sequences shows unilateral/bilateral temporal lobe hyperintensities. CSF analysis shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013500 cells/mm\u00b3), elevated protein (50\u2013100 mg/dL), normal glucose, and RBCs (1000\u201310,000 cells/mm\u00b3). HSV PCR in CSF is gold standard. EEG shows periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges in temporal regions. Second-tier: Brain biopsy only if PCR is negative and suspicion remains high.","management_principles":"First-line: IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14\u201321 days (AAN class I). Early initiation within 24 hours of suspicion reduces mortality to 19% vs. 70% if delayed beyond 48 hours. Adjunctive therapies include steroids for cerebral edema. Renal function must be monitored; adjust dosing for creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat MRI at 2 weeks to assess lesion resolution. Monitor renal function and blood counts twice weekly during therapy. Neurologic follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months for cognitive and seizure assessment. Consider long-term anticonvulsant therapy in ~30% of survivors who develop epilepsy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Temporal lobe hemorrhagic lesions with lymphocytic pleocytosis and RBCs = HSV encephalitis. 2. CSF HSV PCR is 96% sensitive and 99% specific after 72 hours. 3. Start acyclovir empirically if suspected; do not wait for PCR. 4. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges on EEG localize to temporal lobes. 5. Delay in treatment >48 hours triples mortality.","references":"1. Granerod J, et al. Causes of encephalitis in England: a multicentre prospective study.

Pneumococcal. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults, accounting for 50\u201360% of cases (van de Beek et al., 2016; McIntyre et al., 2019). Neisseria meningitidis is the second most frequent cause (20\u201330%) in adolescents and young adults but overall less common in older adults.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute bacterial meningitis is classified under ICD-11: 1D40. Differential includes viral, fungal, and tuberculous meningitis. The governmental clerk\u2019s occupational exposures do not alter the common pathogen distribution. Embryologically, meningeal layers derive from mesenchyme; breach of the BBB by bacteremia leads to meningeal invasion.","pathophysiology":"S. pneumoniae enters bloodstream, crosses BBB via binding to endothelial receptors, and induces a robust inflammatory response in the subarachnoid space. Neutrophils release cytokines and free radicals, causing cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. The polysaccharide capsule evades phagocytosis. Bacterial lysis during antibiotic therapy can worsen inflammation; adjunctive dexamethasone reduces hearing loss and mortality (de Gans & van de Beek, 2002).","clinical_manifestation":"Classic triad: fever (90%), neck stiffness (85%), altered mental status (50%). Headache occurs in 75%, vomiting in 40%, seizures in 20%. Onset is rapid over hours. Untreated, mortality is 20\u201330%; with therapy, mortality is 10\u201315%. Pneumococcal meningitis more often results in complications such as hearing loss.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Blood cultures (60\u201380% yield), CT head if indicated, followed by lumbar puncture. CSF: neutrophilic pleocytosis >1000 cells/mm\u00b3, low glucose <40% of serum, high protein >200 mg/dL, Gram stain sensitivity ~60\u201380%, culture sensitivity ~70\u201385%. Second-tier: Latex agglutination for pneumococcal antigen sensitivity ~90%, PCR for pathogen detection.","management_principles":"First-line: IV vancomycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) plus ampicillin if Listeria risk. Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV every 6 h for 4 days started before or with first antibiotic dose (AHA/IDSA class I). Duration 10\u201314 days. Adjust therapy once S. pneumoniae sensitivity is known; add rifampin if penicillin-resistant.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status daily. Repeat CSF analysis only if no clinical improvement after 48\u201372 hours. Audiometry at discharge and 1 month to detect hearing loss. Follow-up MRI/CT in persistent focal deficits. Outpatient follow-up at 2 and 6 weeks to assess for sequelae.","clinical_pearls":"1. In adults, S. pneumoniae causes >50% of community-acquired bacterial meningitis. 2. Always add dexamethasone before or with first antibiotic dose. 3. Low CSF glucose (<40% of serum) and neutrophilic pleocytosis are hallmarks. 4. Rapid onset (<24 h) differentiates bacterial from viral meningitis. 5. Pneumococcal antigen detection is useful when cultures are negative.","references":"1. van de Beek D, et al.

West Nile virus is known to cause an acute flaccid paralysis syndrome resembling poliomyelitis, often accompanied by seizures and encephalopathy. Large cohort studies during WNV outbreaks have documented flaccid paralysis in up to 5% of symptomatic patients, frequently with asymmetric limb involvement and preserved sensation. Herpes simplex virus (option B) typically causes focal or generalized seizures in the setting of temporal lobe encephalitis, not flaccid paralysis. Cytomegalovirus (option C) causes polyradiculopathy in immunocompromised hosts rather than flaccid paralysis. Rabies virus (option D) leads to encephalitic or paralytic rabies with hyperactivity or ascending paralysis, but seizures are uncommon and the course is uniformly fatal in days.","conceptual_foundation":"West Nile virus is a neurotropic flavivirus transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. In ICD-11, it is categorized under '1E75.30 West Nile virus encephalitis'. Differential includes poliovirus, enterovirus D68, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and other flaviviruses. The virus infects neurons in the spinal anterior horn cells, brainstem, and cortex. WNV was first identified in Uganda in 1937 and emerged in North America in 1999.","pathophysiology":"Following mosquito inoculation, WNV replicates in dermal dendritic cells, spreads to regional lymph nodes, and enters the bloodstream. Viremia leads to breach of the blood\u2013brain barrier by infected leukocytes or olfactory neurons. In the CNS, WNV selectively infects anterior horn cells, leading to neuronal death, resulting in acute flaccid paralysis. Infected cortical and hippocampal neurons can produce seizures when there is significant inflammation and neuronal loss.","clinical_manifestation":"Approximately 1 in 150 WNV infections leads to neuroinvasive disease. Manifestations include meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Flaccid paralysis is asymmetric, often monoparesis, with areflexia and preserved sensory function. Seizures occur in 30\u201340% of encephalitic cases. The median age is >60 years, and risk factors include immunosuppression and diabetes.","diagnostic_approach":"Serologic testing for WNV IgM in CSF is the gold standard (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~100%). PCR in CSF has lower sensitivity (~57%) due to transient viremia. EEG may show diffuse slowing; MRI might reveal T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the spinal cord anterior horns or basal ganglia.","management_principles":"No specific antiviral therapy is approved. Supportive care includes respiratory support if needed, physical therapy, and seizure management with standard antiepileptics. Ribavirin and interferon have shown limited in vitro activity but no proven clinical benefit.","follow_up_guidelines":"Long-term follow-up focuses on rehabilitation for motor deficits. Many patients have persistent weakness; full recovery is uncommon. Neuropsychological assessment may be indicated for cognitive deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1. WNV causes poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis with preserved sensation. 2. CSF WNV IgM is diagnostic. 3. No effective antiviral therapy\u2014supportive care only. 4. Seizures in WNV encephalitis predict worse outcome. 5. Elderly are at highest risk for neuroinvasive disease.","references":"1. Sejvar JJ.
