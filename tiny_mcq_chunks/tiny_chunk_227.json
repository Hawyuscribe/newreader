[{"question_number":"2","question":"Pendular hallucination is associated with which type of lesion?","options":["Midbrain lesion","[Option missing]","[Option missing]"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Midbrain lesion","subspecialty":"Neuropsychiatry","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Pendular hallucinations, classically described as peduncular hallucinosis, are most frequently associated with lesions of the midbrain tegmentum or thalamus. Options B and C are not provided and thus cannot be correct. Peduncular hallucinosis features vivid, formed visual images with preserved insight, reflecting disinhibition of visual association areas secondary to midbrain damage.","conceptual_foundation":"Hallucinations are perceptions without external stimuli and can arise from lesions anywhere along the visual pathways or association cortex. In peduncular hallucinosis, lesions in the midbrain reticular formation disrupt normal inhibitory projections to the occipital visual areas, leading to release phenomena. Historically described by Lhermitte, these hallucinations are formed, colorful, and often of people or animals.","pathophysiology":"Midbrain or thalamic lesions interrupt cholinergic and GABAergic inhibitory inputs to the visual association cortex, particularly Brodmann areas 18 and 19, causing spontaneous cortical activity perceived as hallucinations. The primary visual cortex remains intact, preserving insight and detailed imagery. Neurochemical dysregulation includes intermittent serotonergic and dopaminergic imbalance.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report vivid, lifelike visual images such as people, animals, or scenes. Hallucinations occur in clear consciousness, typically at rest or in low light, and patients usually recognize them as unreal. Onset follows vascular events, demyelination, or neoplasms affecting the midbrain.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis rests on clinical history of formed visual hallucinations with preserved insight, normal primary visual function, and MRI evidence of midbrain lesion. EEG is usually normal. Neuropsychological testing helps differentiate from primary psychiatric disorders. Occult lesions may require contrast-enhanced MRI.","management_principles":"Treatment focuses on the underlying lesion, such as stroke or tumor management. Symptomatic therapy may include low-dose atypical antipsychotics or anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine) based on case reports. There are no large randomized trials; therapy is extrapolated from similar visual release phenomena.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every one to three months to monitor resolution of hallucinations and lesion progression. Repeat MRI at three to six months may assess lesion stability. Neuropsychiatric evaluation should track for emergence of mood or cognitive changes.","clinical_pearls":"1 Peduncular hallucinosis arises from midbrain lesions and produces vivid, formed visual images. 2 Insight is preserved, distinguishing it from psychotic hallucinations. 3 Often follows small-vessel infarcts or hemorrhages in the midbrain. 4 MRI brainstem imaging is diagnostic. 5 Symptomatic treatment may include low-dose antipsychotics.","references":"1 Llorca P et al.

Lesions or epileptic foci in the occipital cortex produce simple (flashes, geometric shapes) or complex (formed images) visual phenomena. Temporal lobe lesions more commonly cause auditory hallucinations, illusions, or complex visual hallucinations in mesial structures but are less specific for primary visual percepts. Midbrain lesions can produce peduncular hallucinosis, which is rare and associated with vivid formed images and preserved insight. Frontal lobe lesions lead to disinhibition, delusions, and confabulation rather than true primary hallucinations.","conceptual_foundation":"Hallucinations are perceptions without external stimulus and are classified by modality: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile. Primary visual hallucinations implicate the occipital cortex (Brodmann areas 17\u201319). Complex visual hallucinations often involve temporo\u2010occipital association areas. Auditory hallucinations implicate Heschl\u2019s gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. Hallucinations in psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia) are primarily auditory and involve temporal and frontal networks. Neuroanatomically, simple visual hallucinations reflect hyperexcitability of primary visual cortex, while complex hallucinations involve higher\u2010order visual association cortices.","pathophysiology":"Lesions in the occipital lobe (stroke, tumor, epilepsy, Charles Bonnet syndrome) lead to deafferentation or direct irritation of visual cortex neurons. Loss of afferent visual input causes disinhibition of intrinsic cortical circuits, leading to spontaneous neuronal firing and hallucinations. In occipital lobe epilepsy, paroxysmal synchronous discharges in striate cortex produce brief visual phenomena, often preceding secondary generalization. In degenerative conditions, retinal or optic pathway damage can trigger Charles Bonnet syndrome via cortical release mechanisms.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with occipital lobe lesions report elementary visual hallucinations (flashing lights, lines, shapes) or complex formed images. Episodes are brief (seconds to minutes) in epilepsy or sustained in structural lesions. Insight is often preserved. In Charles Bonnet syndrome, elderly patients with visual loss experience complex, well\u2010formed images without other neurologic deficits. Frequency and duration correlate with lesion type and extent.","diagnostic_approach":"Neuroimaging with MRI (T2/FLAIR, DWI) identifies occipital lobe lesions such as infarcts, hemorrhages, tumors, or cortical dysplasia. EEG can capture occipital spikes or paroxysmal discharges in epilepsy. Visual field testing localizes scotomas and correlates with cortical deficits. Ophthalmologic evaluation rules out ocular causes of visual phenomena.","management_principles":"Treatment targets the underlying etiology: antiepileptic drugs (e.g., levetiracetam, carbamazepine) for occipital lobe epilepsy, resection or radiosurgery for tumors, and management of vascular lesions. In Charles Bonnet syndrome, patient education and reassurance are first\u2010line; low\u2010dose antipsychotics or SSRIs may be used for distressing hallucinations.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up imaging frequency depends on lesion type: annually for stable lesions, more frequently for progressive neoplasms. Neurologic and neuropsychiatric assessments monitor symptom control and medication side effects. Repeat EEG is indicated if seizures persist.","clinical_pearls":"1. Simple visual hallucinations localize to occipital cortex. 2. Complex formed images often involve temporo\u2010occipital association areas. 3. Occipital lobe epilepsy presents with brief visual phenomena and may generalize. 4. Charles Bonnet syndrome arises from visual deafferentation in the elderly. 5. MRI and EEG are key to localization and etiology determination.","references":"1. ffytche DH. \"Visual hallucinations and the neuropsychiatry of perception.\" Brain. 2007;130(5):1121\u20131135. doi:10.1093/brain/awm138 2.

Among antipsychotic agents, olanzapine is most strongly associated with clinically significant weight gain, with mean increases of 2\u20134 kg over 10 weeks and rates of \u22657% body weight gain in up to 35% of treated patients. Option A (Clozapine) also causes weight gain but is reserved for treatment-resistant cases and less commonly used in Alzheimer\u2019s disease due to hematologic risks. Option B (Quetiapine) has intermediate weight effects (mean gain ~1.5 kg). Option C (Haloperidol) is weight-neutral or may cause slight weight loss due to extrapyramidal side effects.","conceptual_foundation":"Antipsychotics are classified by receptor profiles: olanzapine has high affinity for H1 histamine, 5-HT2C, and muscarinic receptors, driving hyperphagia and metabolic dysregulation. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease, behavioral disturbances may prompt off-label antipsychotic use. Understanding receptor binding helps predict metabolic side effects and guide drug selection in neuropsychiatric management of dementia.","pathophysiology":"Olanzapine-induced weight gain stems from antagonism at H1 and 5-HT2C receptors, leading to increased appetite and altered satiety signaling. It also impairs glucose metabolism via pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Clozapine shares similar mechanisms but is less commonly used in Alzheimer\u2019s due to risk of agranulocytosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Weight gain with olanzapine typically begins within weeks of initiation and continues over months. Patients may develop increased waist circumference, hyperlipidemia, and new-onset insulin resistance. These metabolic changes exacerbate cardiovascular risk in elderly dementia populations.","diagnostic_approach":"Baseline metabolic screening (weight, BMI, fasting glucose, lipids) is mandatory before antipsychotic initiation. Follow-up assessments at 4, 8, and 12 weeks monitor for rapid weight gain. Haloperidol requires less metabolic monitoring but carries extrapyramidal risk.","management_principles":"When antipsychotics are necessary for agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, quetiapine or haloperidol may be preferred if minimizing weight gain is a priority. Olanzapine should be used with caution\u2014start at the lowest effective dose, implement diet/exercise programs, and monitor metabolic parameters closely.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor weight and metabolic labs every 3 months for patients on olanzapine. Discontinue or switch therapy if weight gain exceeds 7% of baseline or if glucose/lipid abnormalities develop. Behavioral interventions should be optimized to minimize antipsychotic exposure.","clinical_pearls":"1. Olanzapine has the highest weight gain risk among antipsychotics. 2. Histamine and 5-HT2C blockade drive hyperphagia. 3. Metabolic monitoring is essential in dementia patients. 4. Haloperidol is weight-neutral but EPS-prone. 5. Behavioral strategies can reduce antipsychotic need.","references":"1. Newcomer JW. Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics and metabolic effects.

He dreams at night, feels guilt, and wishes to leave the army. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Psychosis","Acute depression","Adjustment disorder"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Adjustment disorder","subspecialty":"Neuropsychiatry","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option C is correct: The patient has an identifiable stressor (tank explosion), distress out of proportion, onset within three months, and wish to leave the army. He lacks the pervasive low mood of major depression, and no psychotic features are present. Adjustment disorder criteria (DSM-5-TR) match his presentation, whereas acute major depression requires five symptoms for two weeks and psychosis requires delusions or hallucinations.","conceptual_foundation":"Adjustment disorder is grouped under Trauma- and Stressor- Related Disorders in DSM-5-TR. It occurs within three months of a stressor, with depressive or anxious symptoms. Differential includes PTSD (intrusive memories, hyperarousal for >1 month), acute stress disorder (duration <1 month), and major depressive disorder.","pathophysiology":"While exact mechanisms are unclear, stress exposure activates the HPA axis, increasing cortisol and catecholamines. In adjustment disorder, this reaction is exaggerated but does not establish the neural circuit changes seen in PTSD (e.g., amygdala hyperactivity).","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms include depressed mood, tearfulness, anxiety, or behavioral disturbance. There are no core PTSD symptoms (e.g., flashbacks). In military populations, adjustment disorder can manifest with avoidance of duties and guilt about survivors, without re-experiencing for >1 month.","diagnostic_approach":"Assess timing relative to stressor, symptom count, and rule out other disorders. Use DSM-5-TR criteria: symptoms within 3 months, marked distress, impairment, and symptoms remit within 6 months after stressor removal.","management_principles":"First-line treatment is brief psychotherapy (CBT or problem-solving therapy). Pharmacotherapy (SSRIs) may be used for prominent anxiety or depression but is not routinely indicated. In military settings, ensure supportive counseling and stress inoculation training.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up every 2\u20134 weeks to monitor symptom progression. Discontinue therapy 6 months post-stressor unless symptoms persist. Reassess for major depression or PTSD if symptoms evolve.","clinical_pearls":"1. Adjustment disorder requires linkage to a stressor within 3 months. 2. Nightmares alone do not imply PTSD without re-experiencing criteria. 3. Exclusion of major depression depends on symptom count/duration. 4. Early psychotherapy prevents chronicity. 5. In soldiers, unit support mitigates risk.","references":"[1] American Psychiatric Association. DSM-5-TR. 2022.\n[2] Bryant RA et al. Lancet Psychiatry. 2019;6(10):874\u2013883.
