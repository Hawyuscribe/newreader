[{"question_number":"4","question":"Vitamin B6 deficiency can lead to which type of peripheral neuropathy?","options":["Sensory neuropathy","Motor neuropathy","Mixed neuropathy","Axonal neuropathy"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Axonal neuropathy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D: Axonal neuropathy. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency leads to a sensorimotor axonal peripheral neuropathy characterized by length-dependent degeneration of axons. Nerve conduction studies show reduced amplitudes with relatively preserved conduction velocities. Sensory (A) and motor (B) neuropathies describe clinical patterns but not underlying pathology; mixed neuropathy (C) is clinically true (sensorimotor) but does not specify axonal pathology. Axonal neuropathies have a poorer prognosis if vitamin repletion is delayed. Level B evidence from clinical neurophysiology supports axonal classification.","conceptual_foundation":"Pyridoxine is a cofactor for neurotransmitter synthesis (GABA, dopamine) and sphingolipid metabolism. In ICD-11, nutritional neuropathy is coded under 8A64. Differential includes vitamin B12 deficiency (demyelinating combined system disease) and alcoholic neuropathy (toxic axonal). Historically, B6 deficiency was first described in malnourished populations and with isoniazid therapy.","pathophysiology":"Pyridoxal phosphate is required for the synthesis of sphingolipids essential for axonal myelin maintenance. Deficiency impairs nerve membrane integrity, leading to distal axonal degeneration. Reduced GABA synthesis may contribute to neuropathic pain. The dorsal root ganglia are particularly vulnerable, leading to stocking-glove sensory loss and areflexia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop symmetric distal numbness, paresthesias, and burning pain in feet, progressing proximally. Motor weakness appears later and is mild. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished or absent. Onset is subacute over weeks. In untreated cases, neuropathy can become chronic with foot drop.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: measure plasma pyridoxal phosphate (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). Nerve conduction studies showing reduced compound muscle and sensory action potential amplitudes confirm axonal pattern. Second-tier: sural nerve biopsy demonstrates loss of large myelinated fibers and axonal dropout.","management_principles":"Vitamin B6 repletion with pyridoxine 50\u2013100\u2009mg/day PO corrects deficiency. Higher doses are used transiently in severe cases (up to 200\u2009mg/day). Monitor for overcorrection; chronic high-dose leads to toxicity. No role for corticosteroids or anticonvulsants unless symptomatic.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat clinical exam and nerve conduction studies at 3 and 6\u2009months. Ensure dietary counseling and review interacting medications (e.g., isoniazid). Prognosis is favorable if treated early; axonal regeneration occurs at ~1\u20133\u2009mm/day.","clinical_pearls":"1. Vitamin B6 deficiency neuropathy is axonal\u2014NCV preserved but amplitudes reduced. 2. Check B6 in unexplained axonal neuropathies, especially with malnutrition or TB therapy. 3. Repletion reverses symptoms if started within weeks. 4. Over-supplementation risks sensory ataxia. 5. Distal symmetric presentation mimics diabetic neuropathy\u2014check B6 levels when diabetic control is good.","references":"1. Campistol JM, et al. Nutritional neuropathies.

The hallmark of this condition is the paradoxical myotonia\u2014muscle stiffness that worsens with exercise, rather than improving. Patients experience muscle stiffness during repetitive activities, and symptoms can be exacerbated by cold temperatures, which is a distinctive feature of this disorder. Unlike myotonia congenita, where symptoms may improve with exercise, paramyotonia leads to increased myotonia and sometimes transient weakness, particularly after exertion.\n\n### Incorrect Options","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita is classified as a sodium channelopathy, a subgroup of channelopathies, which are disorders caused by dysfunctional ion channels. The SCN4A gene is crucial for the proper function of voltage-gated sodium channels in skeletal muscle. These channels facilitate the influx of sodium ions during depolarization, an essential process for muscle contraction.\n\nThe exercise-induced worsening of muscle stiffness in paramyotonia can be understood through the concept of muscle excitability and the role of sodium channels. In normal physiology, repeated muscle activity results in a process of depolarization and repolarization that allows for sustained muscle contraction. In paramyotonia, however, the altered behavior of sodium channels leads to prolonged depolarization and inability to repolarize effectively during and after exercise, resulting in increased muscle stiffness.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe underlying pathophysiology of paramyotonia congenita involves mutations in the SCN4A gene, which lead to defective sodium channels. These mutations can cause a range of functional abnormalities, such as:\n- Increased inactivation of sodium channels during activity.\n- Delayed recovery from inactivation after repetitive nerve stimulation.\n- Temperature sensitivity, where colder temperatures further impair channel function.\n\nAs a result, during exercise, there is a paradoxical increase in muscle stiffness due to prolonged depolarization of muscle fibers, leading to a failure to relax properly. Additionally, the transient weakness observed during episodes may be attributed to the overwhelming muscle stiffness that limits normal muscle function.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nPatients with paramyotonia congenita typically present with:\n- Muscle stiffness that exacerbates with exercise and cold exposure, often described as a \"tight\" feeling in muscles.\n- Paradoxical myotonia, where symptoms worsen instead of improving with activity.\n- Transient weakness following episodes of stiffness or exertion, which may last from minutes to several hours.\n- Symptoms may be triggered by environmental factors, particularly cold temperatures, which can lead to significant functional impairment.\n\nClinical manifestations can vary widely among individuals, with some experiencing milder symptoms while others may have more pronounced effects. Symptoms can start in childhood or adolescence and may progress over time.\n\n## 5.
