In pregnancy, acetaminophen is the first-line analgesic for acute migraine attacks due to its safety profile (FDA Category B). Triptans (option A) are generally avoided in the first trimester because of limited safety data, and corticosteroids (option B) are not indicated for acute migraine headache.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent unilateral throbbing pain with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. In ICHD-3 it is classified under code 1.1 (migraine without aura) or 1.2 (with aura). Pregnancy alters migraine frequency, often improving in the second and third trimesters but posing treatment challenges due to fetal safety.","pathophysiology":"Migraine involves activation of the trigeminovascular system, release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neurogenic inflammation, and central modulation in the brainstem. During pregnancy, hormonal fluctuations influence vascular tone and migraine susceptibility, but the fundamental pathophysiology remains similar.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute migraine in pregnancy presents as typical attacks, often unilateral and throbbing, with associated nausea and sensory sensitivities. Frequency may decrease as pregnancy advances, but first\u2010trimester attacks require safe management. Red flags such as sudden onset or focal deficits necessitate further evaluation.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on ICHD-3 criteria. Neuroimaging is reserved for atypical features or red flags. In pregnancy, avoid unnecessary radiation; MRI without contrast is preferred if indicated.","management_principles":"Non-pharmacologic strategies (hydration, rest, cold compresses) are first-line. Acetaminophen is the preferred analgesic. If insufficient, consider antiemetics like metoclopramide. Triptans (sumatriptan) may be considered only after risk\u2013benefit discussion in refractory cases but are not first-line in the first trimester. Corticosteroids are reserved for status migrainosus under specialist care.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes monitoring headache frequency and response to treatment, fetal growth, and maternal blood pressure. A headache diary helps guide therapy adjustments. Collaborate with obstetrics for comprehensive prenatal care.","clinical_pearls":"1. Acetaminophen is the safest first\u2010line analgesic for migraine in pregnancy. 2. Hydration and rest can abort mild attacks without medication. 3. Sumatriptan has the most safety data among triptans but is still second\u2010line. 4. Avoid NSAIDs in the third trimester due to risk of premature ductus arteriosus closure. 5.

What is the appropriate treatment?","options":["IV Depakin","Dihydroergotamine","Subcutaneous sumatriptan","Steroid"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Steroid","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D (Steroid). In status migrainosus during pregnancy, a short course of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone is recommended when first\u2010line therapies (hydration, antiemetics, NSAIDs) fail. Sumatriptan (option C) is Category C but typically reserved for episodic migraine rather than status migrainosus. Dihydroergotamine (option B) is contraindicated in pregnancy due to vasoconstrictive effects and risk of uterine contraction. IV valproate (Depakin, option A) is teratogenic and contraindicated especially in the first trimester (OR for neural tube defects \u2248 10; AAN 2013).","conceptual_foundation":"Status migrainosus is defined as a migraine attack lasting more than 72 hours and refractory to standard abortive treatment. During pregnancy, management is guided by maternal\u2013fetal safety and efficacy, with preferential use of non-teratogenic agents. Corticosteroids cross the placenta but short courses (e.g., 10\u201320 mg prednisone daily for 3\u20135 days or equivalent dexamethasone) have not been associated with major malformations when used judiciously (ACOG 2017). The pathophysiology involves prolonged trigeminovascular activation and central sensitization, which corticosteroids mitigate via anti-inflammatory and membrane-stabilizing effects.","pathophysiology":"Migraine pathophysiology centers on activation of the trigeminovascular system, release of vasoactive neuropeptides (e.g., CGRP, substance P), and neurogenic inflammation. In status migrainosus, persistent central sensitization in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis leads to refractory pain. Corticosteroids inhibit phospholipase A2, reducing arachidonic acid metabolism and downregulating inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) implicated in migraine chronification. This interrupts perpetual nociceptive input and restores homeostasis in pain processing pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with continuous moderate to severe unilateral or bilateral pulsatile headache lasting >72 hours, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. During pregnancy, frequency of status migrainosus is low (<1% of pregnant migraineurs) but poses high morbidity. Physical examination is unremarkable aside from discomfort; neurological exam is typically normal aside from photophobia and phonophobia. Atypical features require neuroimaging to exclude secondary causes.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical based on ICHD-3 criteria for status migrainosus: migraine attack lasting >72 hours despite treatment. In pregnancy, red flags (e.g., focal deficits, papilledema, seizures) warrant MRI without contrast. Laboratory studies (CBC, electrolytes) assess dehydration or secondary causes. No specific biomarkers exist; imaging reserved for atypical or new-onset headache. Pretest probability of secondary headache in pregnancy is low (<2%) in absence of focal signs (NPV of clinical criteria \u2248 98%).","management_principles":"First-tier: aggressive hydration, antiemetics (metoclopramide 10 mg IV Q6H), NSAIDs such as IV ketorolac (30 mg) if second trimester. Second-tier: short course of corticosteroids (dexamethasone 6\u201312 mg IV or oral prednisone 60 mg taper). Sumatriptan (25 mg SC) may be added if still refractory after steroids. Avoid ergots and valproate. Class IIa, Level B recommendation (AAN 2015).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor headache resolution daily during steroid taper. After relief, transition to preventive therapy safe in pregnancy, such as low-dose \u03b2-blockers (propranolol) or amitriptyline. Weekly follow-up to assess headache diary, side effects, and obstetric status. Postpartum review to adjust prophylaxis and counsel on breastfeeding safety.","clinical_pearls":"1. Status migrainosus in pregnancy often requires inpatient management with IV antiemetics and hydration. 2. A short course of corticosteroids is effective and generally safe in the second trimester. 3. Ergot derivatives are strictly contraindicated in pregnancy due to uterine vasoconstriction. 4. Sumatriptan usage in pregnancy has not shown increased major malformations in registry data. 5. Early transition to safe preventive therapies postpartum reduces recurrence risk.","references":"1. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

The American Academy of Neurology guidelines (2019) and International Headache Society ICHD-3 criteria emphasize immediate withdrawal of the offending agents, with supportive \u2018bridge\u2019 therapy if needed. Gradual taper is reserved for opioids and barbiturates but is not necessary for triptans or NSAIDs. Steroids have not been shown in randomized trials to improve outcomes in medication-overuse headache and are not guideline-recommended.","conceptual_foundation":"Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is classified under ICHD-3 as a secondary headache attributed to the overuse of acute headache medications. Criteria require headache \u226515 days/month in a patient with preexisting primary headache disorder and intake of simple analgesics \u226515 days/month or triptans/combination analgesics \u226510 days/month for >3 months. MOH represents a maladaptive chronification of episodic headache due to frequent analgesic exposure.","pathophysiology":"Chronic overuse of triptans and NSAIDs induces central sensitization via upregulation of nociceptive neurotransmitters (e.g., CGRP, substance P) in the trigeminovascular system. Repeated receptor agonism leads to receptor down-regulation and impaired endogenous pain control, fostering a lower threshold for headache generation. Key mechanisms include alterations in 5-HT1B/1D receptor density and dysregulation of descending inhibitory pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with daily or near-daily, often non-specific, bidirectional headaches that may lack classic migraine features. Medication use paradoxically prolongs and intensifies headache episodes. Comorbid anxiety and depression are common. Physical examination is typically normal apart from non-focal findings.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, per ICHD-3. Brain imaging is only indicated if red flags are present. A detailed medication history, headache diary, and application of ICHD-3 criteria are critical. No laboratory tests are required. Diagnostic certainty improves with prospective headache monitoring post-withdrawal.","management_principles":"First-line management is abrupt cessation of the overused medication, accompanied by short-term bridging therapy (e.g., naproxen 500 mg BID or a 5-day prednisone taper). Initiate or optimize preventive therapy (e.g., topiramate, beta-blockers, CGRP monoclonal antibodies) during withdrawal to reduce relapse risk. Behavioral therapies and patient education on limiting acute medication to \u22642 days/week are integral.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up at 2\u20134 weeks post-withdrawal to assess headache frequency and withdrawal symptoms. Continue preventive therapy adjustment based on response. Long-term follow-up every 3\u20136 months with headache diaries to identify any recurrent overuse.","clinical_pearls":"1. MOH requires \u226515 headache days/month plus analgesic overuse. 2. Triptans and NSAIDs can be stopped abruptly; reserve tapering for opioids/barbiturates. 3. Early initiation of preventive therapy during withdrawal reduces relapse. 4. Use headache diaries to monitor progress. 5. Educate patients to limit acute meds to \u22642 days/week.","references":"1.
