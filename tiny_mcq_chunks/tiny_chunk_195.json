[{"question_number":"6","question":"Histopathology for the attached magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows which of the following features indicative of Ependymoma grade II WHO?","options":["Pseudopalisading","Pseudorosette","Fried egg appearance","Psammoma bodies ## Page 37"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Pseudorosette","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. True ependymal rosettes and perivascular pseudorosettes are characteristic of ependymoma WHO grade II. In pseudorosettes, tumor cells form a radial arrangement around blood vessels, a feature seen in ependymomas arising from the ependymal lining. Option A (pseudopalisading) is seen in glioblastoma, C (fried egg) in oligodendroglioma, and D (psammoma bodies) in meningioma.","conceptual_foundation":"Ependymomas are glial tumors derived from ependymal cells lining ventricular systems and central canal. They are classified by WHO into subtypes: myxopapillary (I), grade II (classic and papillary), and anaplastic (III). Classic grade II shows pseudorosettes. Under ICD-11, code 2B21. Differential includes choroid plexus papilloma and medulloblastoma. Molecular subgroups (REL A fusion) refine prognosis. Historically, perivascular pseudorosettes were first described by Bailey and Cushing in 1926.","pathophysiology":"Normal ependymal cells regulate CSF flow. Neoplastic transformation involves aberrant Notch and Hedgehog signaling. In grade II ependymoma, tumor cells proliferate around capillaries, forming pseudorosettes. The pattern arises as neoplastic cells adhere to basal lamina of vessels. Genetic alterations include RELA fusion in supratentorial tumors and chromosome 22q loss in posterior fossa variants. These molecular drivers promote cell adhesion and perivascular growth.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinical features depend on tumor location. Posterior fossa ependymomas in children present with ataxia, hydrocephalus, and headaches. Spinal ependymomas in adults present with back pain and progressive myelopathy. Grade II tumors have intermediate aggressiveness. Seizures can occur in supratentorial lesions. Symptoms are subacute, evolving over weeks to months.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI shows a well-demarcated, contrast-enhancing mass within ventricles or spinal canal. T2 shows heterogeneous signal. Preoperative planning includes CSF cytology to rule out drop metastases. Diagnosis is confirmed by surgical biopsy demonstrating perivascular pseudorosettes and immunopositivity for GFAP, EMA dot staining, and S100. WHO recommends molecular profiling (RELA fusion, 1q gain) for prognostication (Level C evidence).","management_principles":"Standard treatment is maximal safe resection. Extent of resection is the strongest prognostic factor. Adjuvant radiotherapy (54\u201359 Gy) is recommended for grade II in adults, especially after subtotal resection. Chemotherapy has limited proven benefit but may be used in pediatric recurrent disease. Follow guidelines from the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) and the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO).","follow_up_guidelines":"Surveillance MRI every 3\u20136 months for 5 years, then annually. Neurological exam at each visit. Spinal imaging if initial CSF spread risk. Monitor for radiotherapy late effects and endocrine dysfunction if craniospinal irradiation used.","clinical_pearls":"1. Perivascular pseudorosettes are the hallmark of ependymoma grade II. 2. Extent of resection is the most important prognostic factor. 3. Supratentorial and posterior fossa ependymomas have distinct molecular subgroups. 4. Spinal ependymomas often present with pain and myelopathy in adults. 5. Adjuvant radiotherapy improves local control after subtotal resection.","references":"1. Louis DN et al. WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System. 4th ed. IARC; 2016.\n2.

What is your next step in management?","options":["Radiotherapy","Steroid","Chemotherapy","Debulking"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Steroid","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Steroid (dexamethasone). In patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) presenting with significant vasogenic edema and raised intracranial pressure (ICP), high-dose corticosteroids rapidly reduce capillary permeability and edema, improving neurologic status (Alavi JB et al. 2016, J Neurooncol). Radiotherapy (option A) and chemotherapy (option C) follow once clinical stability is achieved. Debulking surgery (option D) may worsen edema acutely unless preceded by steroids. The 2021 EANO guidelines recommend initial dexamethasone 4\u201316 mg/day in divided doses for symptomatic cerebral edema (Level II evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Vasogenic edema in intracranial tumors arises from blood\u2013brain barrier disruption and increased vascular permeability. Glucocorticoids stabilize endothelial tight junctions and decrease inflammatory mediators. In ICD-11, GBM is under malignant primary brain tumors. Differential includes metastatic lesions, meningioma, CNS lymphoma. Steroid efficacy in reducing peritumoral edema was first described in the 1960s; subsequent imaging and molecular studies refined dosing strategies. GBM originates from astrocytic lineage, WHO grade IV. Tumor metabolism relies on aberrant angiogenesis (VEGF overexpression) and hypoxia-inducible factors, which steroids may modulate indirectly.","pathophysiology":"Normal brain interstitial fluid balance is maintained by intact BBB. GBM induces neoangiogenesis with leaky vessels, leading to vasogenic edema. Dexamethasone binds glucocorticoid receptors in vascular endothelium, reducing VEGF production and transendothelial water flux. It also downregulates inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), stabilizing the BBB. Temporal dynamics: edema reduction occurs within 24\u201348 hours, whereas tumor cytoreduction requires a multimodal approach. Corticosteroids do not crosslink DNA like chemotherapeutics but mitigate peritumoral inflammation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with headache, nausea, vomiting, papilledema, altered consciousness from increased ICP. Focal deficits occur based on tumor location. GBM most commonly affects frontal and temporal lobes in adults aged 45\u201370 (mean 64). Without treatment, median survival is 3\u20134 months; steroids alone improve symptoms but not survival. Steroid\u2010responsive cerebral edema can cause transient improvement prior to definitive therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial MRI with contrast identifies ring\u2010enhancing lesion and quantifies edema. Steroid therapy may reduce contrast enhancement, so imaging before steroids is ideal if patient stable. ICP monitoring is rarely needed if symptoms respond. Perfusion MRI and MR spectroscopy help delineate tumor from radiation necrosis. Pre\u2010steroid imaging sensitivity ~95% for detecting edema; post\u2010steroid sensitivity decreases by ~20%. Biopsy and molecular profiling (IDH mutation, MGMT methylation) follow stabilization.","management_principles":"Administer dexamethasone 10 mg IV loading, then 4 mg every 6 hours, tapering over weeks once edema controlled (EANO 2021, Level B). Monitor for hyperglycemia, hypertension, myopathy, infection. First-tier: steroids for symptomatic edema. Second-tier: anti-VEGF therapy (bevacizumab) if refractory edema despite steroids. Third-tier: interventions such as osmotherapy or decompressive craniectomy reserved for malignant intracranial hypertension not responsive to steroids. Antiepileptic prophylaxis is not routinely recommended.","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess neurologic status daily while inpatient; follow-up MRI 2\u20134 weeks after steroid initiation to plan radiotherapy. Taper steroids by 1 mg every 3\u20135 days to lowest effective dose. Monitor blood glucose daily and bone density in long-term use. Quality of life scales (EORTC QLQ-BN20) used at baseline and every 3 months. Transition to outpatient neuro\u2010oncology clinic for chemoradiation planning and supportive care.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always administer dexamethasone before biopsy or radiotherapy in patients with symptomatic cerebral edema. 2. Steroids improve symptoms but not overall survival in GBM\u2014plan definitive therapy concurrently. 3. High-dose steroids can mask radiographic tumor contrast; if feasible, obtain MRI prior to steroid initiation. 4. Taper steroids gradually to avoid adrenal insufficiency. 5. Monitor for steroid side effects: hyperglycemia, muscle weakness, mood changes.","references":"1. Alavi JB, et al. Dexamethasone in brain tumor\u2013related edema: mechanisms and clinical effect.

No other primary intracranial tumors reliably demonstrate psammoma bodies as a diagnostic hallmark. Thus, option A, \u201cMeningioma,\u201d is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Meningiomas arise from arachnoid cap cells of the leptomeninges (meningothelial cells). They are classified by WHO into grades I (benign), II (atypical), and III (anaplastic) based on mitotic figures, brain invasion, and histological features. Psammoma bodies represent dystrophic calcification within these tumors and reflect the slow growth and chronicity of grade I lesions.","pathophysiology":"Meningiomas develop from arachnoidal cells proliferating under influence of hormonal and genetic factors, notably NF2 gene mutations on chromosome 22q. The resulting neoplastic tissue often undergoes repeated cycles of cell turnover and deposition of extracellular matrix, leading to calcification and formation of laminated psammoma bodies.","clinical_manifestation":"Most meningiomas present in middle-aged to elderly adults (peak 40\u201370 years), with a female predominance. They often manifest with seizures, focal neurologic deficits, or signs of raised intracranial pressure depending on location. Slow growth allows psammoma bodies to accumulate over years.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with contrast typically shows a dural-based, homogeneously enhancing extra-axial mass with a \u2018dural tail.\u2019 CT may reveal calcifications corresponding to psammoma bodies. Definitive diagnosis is by histopathology with immunopositivity for EMA and vimentin.","management_principles":"Complete surgical resection is the mainstay for symptomatic lesions, aiming for Simpson grade I removal. Adjuvant radiotherapy is reserved for subtotal resections or grade II/III tumors. No chemotherapy is routinely indicated for WHO grade I meningiomas.","follow_up_guidelines":"Surveillance MRI at 6 months post-resection, then annually for 5 years.

Cerebellopontine angle (CPA) masses with psammoma bodies on histopathology are characteristic of meningioma, which frequently exhibits whorled cell patterns and calcified psammoma bodies (Louis et al. 2021, WHO Classification). Ependymomas (option B) are intraventricular or spinal tumors without psammoma bodies. Schwannomas (option C) show Antoni A and B areas with Verocay bodies rather than psammoma bodies. Option D is incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"CPA lesions include vestibular schwannoma, meningioma, epidermoid, and metastases. In ICD-11, meningioma is under tumors of meninges, WHO grade I. Historically described by Cushing in the early 20th century, meningiomas arise from arachnoid cap cells. Psammoma bodies are concentric calcifications from apoptotic cell debris. Meningiomas are more common in middle\u2010aged women, often express progesterone receptors, and may be related to NF2 gene on chromosome 22.","pathophysiology":"Meningiomas grow from arachnoid villi, compressing adjacent neural structures. They are highly vascular, deriving blood from dural vessels (MMA). Molecularly, NF2 inactivation leads to merlin protein loss, promoting uncontrolled proliferation. Calcification (psammoma bodies) arises from dystrophic mineralization in slow\u2010growing tumors. Schwannomas derive from Schwann cells of cranial nerve VIII and demonstrate S100 positivity; their histology lacks psammoma bodies.","clinical_manifestation":"CPA meningiomas present with hearing loss, tinnitus, and facial numbness or weakness due to trigeminal and facial nerve involvement. Growth is slow; symptoms develop insidiously over months to years. Hydrocephalus and increased ICP can cause headache and ataxia. Vestibular schwannomas present with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss before facial symptoms. Ependymomas in the CPA are exceedingly rare.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with contrast shows a dural\u2010tail sign for meningioma, homogeneously enhancing extra-axial mass. CT demonstrates calcifications (psammoma bodies). Audiometry identifies asymmetric sensorineural loss. Angiography may show tumor blush from MMA. Biopsy confirms whorled architecture and psammoma bodies. Genetic testing for NF2 mutation indicated in bilateral lesions or family history.","management_principles":"Observation with serial MRI is appropriate for small, asymptomatic meningiomas. Symptomatic lesions or growth >2 mm/year warrant surgical resection (Simpson grade I) to achieve dural base removal. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an option for residual or deep lesions. No role for chemotherapy in grade I tumors. Pregnancy may accelerate growth via progesterone receptor stimulation; monitor closely.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients undergo MRI at 3 months post-surgery, then annually for 5 years, then every 2\u20133 years if stable. Monitor cranial nerve function, hearing (audiogram), and imaging for recurrence. Grade II and III require more frequent imaging and possible adjuvant radiotherapy.","clinical_pearls":"1. CPA meningiomas often present with trigeminal neuropathy and facial numbness before hearing loss\u2014contrast with schwannomas. 2. Psammoma bodies are pathognomonic for meningioma histology. 3. Dural-tail sign on MRI is highly specific (>95%) for meningioma. 4. NF2 gene mutations underlie familial and sporadic meningiomas, especially in younger patients. 5.
