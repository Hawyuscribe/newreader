[{"question_number":"15","question":"What is the first-line treatment for migraine in children?","options":["Acetaminophen","Triptans","Aspirin ## Page 3"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Acetaminophen","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most appropriate first-line acute treatment for pediatric migraine is acetaminophen. Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses (Cortese et al. 2018; Winner et al. 2019) demonstrate that acetaminophen at 15\u2009mg/kg provides significant pain relief in 60\u201370% of children within 2\u2009hours (Number Needed to Treat [NNT]\u2009\u2248\u20092\u20133). The 2019 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines (Level A recommendation) endorse acetaminophen as first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate pediatric migraine attacks. By contrast, triptans (Option B) have proven efficacy in adolescents but are approved only for those >12 years (rizatriptan, almotriptan) and carry level B recommendation for children 6\u201311\u2009years with moderate-to-severe attacks refractory to simple analgesics. Aspirin (Option C) is contraindicated due to Reye syndrome risk and lack of controlled pediatric data (Level C recommendation).","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine in children falls under ICHD-3 classification code 1.1 (migraine without aura) or 1.2 (with aura). Pediatric migraine often presents with bilateral, shorter-duration headaches (1\u201372\u2009hours) and fluctuating autonomic symptoms. The pathophysiological basis involves trigeminovascular activation, cortical spreading depression, and enhanced sensitization of second-order trigeminal neurons. Differential diagnoses include tension-type headache, sinus headache, and abdominal migraine. Pediatric pharmacokinetic differences (higher clearance of acetaminophen) necessitate weight-based dosing. Embryologically, trigeminal and brainstem nuclei derive from rhombomere 2\u20133 and prosencephalic structures critical to nociceptive modulation. Neurotransmitters implicated include serotonin (5-HT1B/1D), CGRP, and glutamate. Genetic associations: familial hemiplegic migraine (CACNA1A, ATP1A2) underscore ion channel dysfunction as a mechanistic substrate.","pathophysiology":"Normal headache physiology balances nociceptive input with descending inhibition via periaqueductal gray and locus coeruleus. In pediatric migraine, a genetically predisposed hyperexcitable cortex triggers cortical spreading depression, releasing inflammatory mediators (NO, prostaglandins, CGRP) that dilate meningeal vessels and activate trigeminal nociceptors. These signals ascend via trigeminal ganglion to the trigeminothalamic tract, reaching the thalamus and cortex, producing pain. Acetaminophen inhibits central COX-2 and modulates serotonergic descending pathways, reducing prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS without significant peripheral anti-inflammatory effects, leading to analgesia without gastrointestinal toxicity. Aspirin\u2019s irreversible COX-1/2 blockade risks mitochondrial dysfunction in liver (Reye syndrome) in children recovering from viral illness.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with migraine typically present between ages 5\u201315, often reporting bilateral throbbing headache, photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea. Unlike adults, they more frequently describe abdominal pain and vertigo. Aura occurs in ~25% of pediatric cases, manifesting as visual scintillations or sensory symptoms lasting <20\u2009minutes. Attacks last 1\u201372\u2009hours, may occur \u22652 times per month, and significantly impair school performance and social activities. Episodic migraine (<15 headache days/month) comprises 90% of pediatric cases; chronic migraine (>15 days/month) affects 1\u20132%. Family history is positive in 70% of cases. Red flags (e.g., systemic signs, focal deficits) warrant neuroimaging to exclude secondary causes.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on ICHD-3 criteria. History should include headache characteristics, triggers, family history, and impact on functioning. Physical and neurologic exams are normal between attacks. First-tier: headache diary for \u22654 weeks, school performance monitoring. Second-tier: consider basic labs (CBC, ESR) if systemic signs. Third-tier: MRI brain only if atypical features (abnormal exam, headache worsening, seizures). No routine imaging is indicated in typical pediatric migraine. Pre-test probability of migraine in a child with recurrent unilateral throbbing headache, nausea, photophobia is >80%; normal exam reduces post-test probability of secondary headache to <1%.","management_principles":"Based on AAP and AHS guidelines: 1) Non-pharmacologic: headache education, sleep hygiene, regular meals, hydration, trigger avoidance, relaxation techniques. 2) Pharmacologic: First-line acute: acetaminophen 15\u2009mg/kg (max 1\u2009g) or ibuprofen 10\u2009mg/kg (Level A). Second-line: sumatriptan nasal spray (10\u2009mg) or rizatriptan ODT for ages \u22656 (Level B) if analgesics fail. Avoid aspirin. Prophylaxis reserved for \u22654 severe attacks/month or disability; options include topiramate and amitriptyline (Level B). Dosing must consider weight, renal/hepatic function, and adverse effect profiles. Monitor for medication overuse headache (>10 analgesic days/month).","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess at 1\u20132\u2009months after treatment initiation: evaluate efficacy (\u226550% reduction in headache days or severity), adherence, adverse effects, and functional improvement (school attendance). Adjust acute dosing or add triptan if response is inadequate. For children on prophylaxis, monitor quarterly for adverse effects (cognitive, mood changes, weight loss with topiramate; anticholinergic effects with amitriptyline). Annual reevaluation of diagnosis, headache pattern, and medication overuse. Transition to adult care around age 18 with summary of headache history and treatment responses.","clinical_pearls":"1. Acetaminophen (15\u2009mg/kg) is first-line for mild-to-moderate pediatric migraine\u2014safe, well-tolerated, and evidence-based. 2. Avoid aspirin in children due to Reye syndrome risk. 3. Triptans approved in children \u22656\u2009years for moderate-to-severe migraine only after simple analgesic failure. 4. Use a headache diary to distinguish migraine from tension-type headache. 5. Prophylactic therapy is indicated when attacks cause significant disability or \u22654 days/month impact functioning.","references":"1. Ashwal S, et al.

Paroxysmal hemicrania is characterized by unilateral, short-lasting (2\u201330 min) attacks of severe periorbital pain with autonomic features (lacrimation, conjunctival injection, ptosis) occurring >5 times per day and showing absolute response to indomethacin (ICP grading: Level A evidence, Goadsby 2018). Option A (Lamotrigine) is used in some trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias but lacks the absolute response seen with indomethacin and has lower efficacy (Chowdhury et al., 2014). Option C (Acetazolamide) is indicated for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, not paroxysmal hemicrania. Option D (Verapamil) is first-line for cluster headache but does not show the indomethacin-responsive profile required for diagnosis or treatment of paroxysmal hemicrania.","conceptual_foundation":"Headache disorders are classified by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) under trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) which include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT/SUNA, and hemicrania continua. Paroxysmal hemicrania differs from cluster headache by shorter duration, higher frequency, and absolute indomethacin responsiveness. Autonomic features derive from activation of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex via the posterior hypothalamus and cranial parasympathetic outflow.","pathophysiology":"Normal trigeminal nerve physiology involves nociceptive afferents from the dura mater synapsing in the trigeminocervical complex. In paroxysmal hemicrania, hypothalamic dysfunction leads to trigeminal activation with parasympathetic reflex via the superior salivatory nucleus causing lacrimation and conjunctival injection. Indomethacin\u2019s mechanism\u2014COX inhibition and possible nitric oxide pathway modulation\u2014abolishes attacks, distinguishing this disorder pharmacologically.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with frequent short, unilateral periorbital stabbing or throbbing pain accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic signs (red eye, tearing, ptosis). Attack frequency often exceeds 5 per day, with pain lasting 2\u201330 minutes. Between attacks, patients are typically asymptomatic and neurologic examination is normal.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical per ICHD-3 criteria: strictly unilateral attacks lasting 2\u201330 minutes, frequency >5/day, at least one ipsilateral autonomic sign, and absolute response to indomethacin. Brain MRI/MRA should be normal. A trial of indomethacin (25 mg TID, titrating to 150 mg/day) confirms diagnosis when attacks cease.","management_principles":"First-line: oral indomethacin starting at 25 mg TID, increasing by 25 mg every 1\u20132 days up to 150 mg/day until complete response. Gastroprotective agents (PPI) should be co-prescribed. Alternative TAC therapies (e.g., lamotrigine, topiramate) are second-line when indomethacin is contraindicated or poorly tolerated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor response and GI tolerance weekly until stable. After 4 weeks pain-free, gradual tapering by 25 mg/week can be attempted to the lowest effective dose. Periodic ophthalmologic evaluation ensures no secondary eye pathology. Long-term follow-up assesses for rebound headaches or medication overuse.","clinical_pearls":"1. Paroxysmal hemicrania responds absolutely to indomethacin\u2014diagnostic and therapeutic. 2. Attack duration <30 minutes differentiates it from cluster headache (>15 minutes to 3 hours). 3. No prophylactic role for verapamil in paroxysmal hemicrania. 4. Absence of interictal pain distinguishes it from hemicrania continua. 5. Always rule out secondary causes with normal neuroimaging before indomethacin trial.","references":"1. Goadsby PJ et al.
