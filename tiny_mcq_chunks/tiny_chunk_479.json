Optic neuritis presents primarily with visual acuity loss and pain on eye movement rather than extraocular muscle weakness or ptosis. Basilar (brainstem) migraine manifests with brainstem aura (dysarthria, tinnitus, ataxia) but not isolated oculomotor palsy. Cluster headache attacks are brief (15\u2013180 minutes), severe, and associated with autonomic features (lacrimation, rhinorrhea) rather than prolonged ophthalmoplegia. Multiple case series (e.g., Prakash et al., Neurology 2020) report third-nerve enhancement on MRI in ophthalmoplegic migraine, supporting a neuropathic rather than vascular etiology.","conceptual_foundation":"Ophthalmoplegic migraine was classified in ICHD-2 as a migraine variant but reclassified in ICHD-3 (2018) under \"recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy\". Under ICD-11 it resides in \"Headache disorders attributable to cranial neuropathy.\" Differential diagnoses include Tolosa\u2010Hunt syndrome, diabetic ischemic third-nerve palsy, aneurysm, neoplasm, and inflammatory neuropathies. Unlike basilar migraine (ICHD-3 1.2.6) which involves posterior circulation aura, ophthalmoplegic migraine specifically involves neuritis of the oculomotor nerve. Embryologically, the oculomotor nerve arises from the midbrain motor nuclei which communicate with the trigeminovascular system; inflammation here may trigger migraine pathways.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology involves trigeminovascular nociceptive pathways converging on the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. In ophthalmoplegic migraine, inflammation/demyelination of the oculomotor nerve (CN III) occurs\u2014MRI shows gadolinium enhancement of the cisternal segment. Molecularly, elevated cytokines (IL-6) in nerve tissue have been documented (Smith et al., Cephalalgia 2019). The trigeminal autonomic reflex may mediate headache, while secondary inflammatory damage to the nerve causes ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. This differs from cluster headache, where hypothalamic activation triggers cranial autonomic symptoms rapidly; and from optic neuritis, in which myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies lead to optic nerve demyelination.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients\u2014often children or young adults\u2014experience recurrent unilateral headache preceding or accompanying extraocular muscle weakness. Attacks last days (mean 4\u201310 days) and recover over weeks. Ptosis and diplopia resolve between attacks. Visual acuity remains normal. Cluster headaches feature strictly unilateral, brief attacks with ipsilateral autonomic signs and no ophthalmoplegia. Optic neuritis has painful eye movement and visual field defects without ptosis.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: detailed history and neurological exam. MRI brain with contrast should assess CN III enhancement (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90% per Lee et al., AJNR 2021). MR angiography to exclude aneurysm compressing CN III. Second-tier: CSF analysis if demyelinating or infectious etiology suspected. Exclude Tolosa\u2010Hunt syndrome via MRI cavernous sinus study. Third-tier: nerve biopsy is not indicated routinely. Diagnostic criteria per ICHD-3 require \u22652 attacks, ipsilateral headache, paresis of one or more ocular cranial nerves, MRI or CSF evidence of inflammation, and exclusion of other causes.","management_principles":"Acute therapy: high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 1 mg/kg for 5\u20137 days) often hasten resolution of ophthalmoplegia (Level B evidence, AHS 2019 guidelines). Headache treated with standard migraine analgesics (NSAIDs, triptans). Prophylaxis: lower-dose steroids, calcium channel blockers (verapamil 80\u2013240 mg daily), or antiepileptics (topiramate 50\u2013100 mg nightly) may reduce attack frequency (small open-label studies). Avoid typical migraine triggers and monitor blood pressure with verapamil.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess clinically within 2\u20134 weeks to confirm resolution of ophthalmoplegia.

Multiple large cohort studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that patients with migraine with aura have approximately a two-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to non-migraineurs (Etminan et al., 2005; Kurth et al., 2006). The Women\u2019s Health Study (Bushnell et al., 2005) reported a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.62 (95% CI: 1.09\u20132.41) for ischemic stroke among women with migraine with aura. By contrast, migraine without aura does not consistently show a significant increase in stroke risk (HR ~1.0\u20131.2, often not statistically significant). Option B is incorrect because it ignores the demonstrated elevated risk in the aura subgroup. A common misconception is to generalize migraine overall as not associated with stroke risk; however, subgroup analyses clearly distinguish migraine with aura as the at-risk population according to AHA/ASA guidelines (2014).","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is classified under ICHD-3 as a primary headache disorder. Migraine with aura involves transient focal neurological symptoms, typically visual, preceding headache. In epidemiologic nosology (ICD-11 G43.x), migraine with aura has been consistently associated with vascular comorbidity. The differential for reversible visual disturbances includes transient ischemic attack, occipital seizures, and ophthalmologic pathology. Historically, the link between migraine aura and stroke was first suggested in 1950s observational reports; subsequent cohort studies in the 1990s refined the risk estimate. Embryologically, the cerebral cortex and vascular endothelium share origins in neuroectoderm, which may underlie shared susceptibility. Key structures include the occipital cortex (visual aura), the posterior circulation, and small vessel endothelium. Genetic studies implicate variants in MTHFR and NOTCH3 in familial hemiplegic migraine and CADASIL, respectively, illustrating overlaps in migraine, small-vessel disease, and stroke risk.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, cerebral blood flow is tightly regulated by neurovascular coupling. In migraine with aura, cortical spreading depolarization leads to transient hyperemia followed by prolonged oligemia, endothelial activation, and increased platelet aggregation. This transient dysfunction predisposes to microthrombi formation. Endothelial dysfunction in migraineurs is evidenced by impaired flow-mediated dilation and elevated markers of vascular inflammation (e.g., endothelin-1). Genetic predisposition (e.g., MTHFR C677T) may exacerbate hyperhomocysteinemia, further impairing endothelium. Chronic migraineurs exhibit increased white matter hyperintensities on MRI, correlating with microvascular injury. By contrast, migraine without aura lacks robust spreading depolarization and hence shows minimal endothelial perturbation, accounting for the absence of significant stroke risk elevation.","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine with aura presents with transient visual (90%), sensory (30%), or speech (10%) disturbances, typically developing over 5\u201320 minutes and lasting <60 minutes. Headache follows within an hour in 80% of cases. Stroke in migraineurs often occurs in young women (<45 years) with aura, especially smokers or on estrogen\u2010based contraceptives. Prodromal features (e.g., mood change, fatigue) may precede aura. In untreated cases, recurrent migraine attacks with aura can lead to progressive small\u2010vessel ischemic changes, white matter lesions, and rare transformation to migrainous infarction (ICHD-3 code 1.2.4). Migrainous infarction accounts for <0.5% of all ischemic strokes but is reported in up to 13% of migrainous stroke series.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes thorough history for aura characteristics and stroke risk factors (smoking, hypertension, OCP use). MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging is recommended (sensitivity ~96%, specificity ~98%) to distinguish migrainous infarction from benign aura (AHA/ASA 2014, Class I, Level B). Transcranial Doppler bubble study (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~80%) evaluates patent foramen ovale, which is enriched in migraine with aura. Second-tier tests: vascular imaging (MRA/CTA) to assess for vasculopathies; cardiac evaluation (echocardiography) if cardioembolism suspected. Third-tier: hypercoagulability panel in recurrent or cryptogenic events, especially in young patients. Pre-test probability is highest in women <45 with aura and additional risk factors (e.g., HR for OCP use ~2.4).","management_principles":"Management centers on migraine prophylaxis and stroke prevention. First-line prophylactics include beta-blockers (metoprolol 100\u2013200 mg/day) and topiramate (50\u2013100 mg BID); these reduce aura frequency by ~50% (Level A evidence, AAN 2015). Control of vascular risk factors: smoking cessation (NNT to prevent one stroke = 52 over 5 years), blood pressure control (target <130/80 mmHg), and avoidance of estrogen\u2010containing contraceptives in high-risk women (Class I recommendation, AHA/ASA 2014). Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75\u2013100 mg/day) may be considered in those with additional cardiovascular risk. Triptans should be used cautiously; no direct evidence linking them to increased stroke risk but avoided in those with known vasculopathy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3\u20136 months to monitor migraine frequency, aura characteristics, and vascular risk factor control. Repeat MRI recommended if neurological deficits evolve or new aura types occur. Annual cardiovascular risk assessment including lipid profile and blood pressure. Functional assessment using HIT-6 and MIDAS scales biannually to guide prophylaxis adjustments. Transition of care: discuss long-term contraceptive planning with patients of childbearing age. Monitor for white matter lesion progression on MRI every 2\u20133 years in patients with frequent aura and ischemic changes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Migraine with aura doubles ischemic stroke risk (HR ~1.8\u20132.3) and is distinct from migraine without aura. 2. Avoid estrogen\u2010based contraceptives in women with migraine aura plus vascular risk factors; switch to progestin\u2010only methods. 3. Migrainous infarction is diagnosed only when DWI-MRI confirms infarction in a vascular territory that correlates with aura symptoms. 4. Cortical spreading depolarization underlies aura and transient endothelial dysfunction\u2014key pathophysiologic link to stroke. 5. Patent foramen ovale is more prevalent in migraine with aura; consider closure only in cryptogenic stroke after multidisciplinary evaluation.","references":"1. Etminan M et al.

Option A accurately describes these features based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) criteria and multiple pediatric cohort studies (Lewis et al. 2010; Hershey et al. 2015). By contrast, Option B is incorrect because children more frequently experience gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea and vomiting, with vomiting reported in up to 70% of pediatric migraine attacks (Powers et al. 2013). Option C, although it correctly notes that aura is less common in children (<10\u201315%) than in adults (~25\u201330%), does not capture the primary distinguishing clinical differences of bilateral location and shorter duration, which are universally recognized as the hallmark pediatric features. Thus, A is the most correct answer.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding pediatric migraine requires familiarity with ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria and their pediatric modifications. The ICHD-3 defines migraine without aura as at least five attacks lasting 4\u201372 hours in adults, but pediatric criteria allow a shorter minimum duration of 2 hours (Oskoui et al. 2018). Historically, the IHS criteria evolved from demanding longer durations in IHS 1988 to more developmentally appropriate thresholds in ICHD-2 and ICHD-3. Pediatric migraine is coded in ICD-11 under 8A80.0\u20138A80.2. Differential diagnoses include tension-type headache, abdominal migraine, cyclical vomiting syndrome, and secondary causes such as intracranial masses or infection. Embryologically, trigeminal sensory neurons arise from the neural crest, and central pain modulatory circuits mature postnatally, influencing pediatric presentation. Neuroanatomically, the trigeminovascular system\u2014comprising the trigeminal ganglion, nucleus caudalis, and meningeal vasculature\u2014mediates headache pain. Neurotransmitters implicated include calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), serotonin, and glutamate. Genetic factors such as PRRT2 and CACNA1A mutations suggest channelopathy contributions. Thus, pediatric migraine fits within a neurodevelopmental framework, distinct from adult patterns due to ongoing maturation of nociceptive pathways and vascular responses.","pathophysiology":"Normal headache physiology centers on activation of the trigeminovascular system, release of vasoactive neuropeptides (e.g., CGRP, substance P), and central sensitization within the brainstem, thalamus, and cortex. In pediatric migraine, immature descending inhibitory pathways in the periaqueductal gray and rostral ventromedial medulla lead to faster onset and shorter attacks. Cortical spreading depression propagates more slowly in children, often failing to produce overt aura symptoms. Serotonin receptor (5-HT1B/1D) expression and function differ with age, altering vasoconstrictive responses. Genetic studies demonstrate familial hemiplegic migraine mutations affect ion channel gating, but in typical pediatric migraine, polygenic influences modulate neuronal hyperexcitability. Inflammatory mediators released by meningeal mast cells and endothelial activation further exacerbate pain transmission. Compensatory vascular autoregulation in children limits attack duration, resulting in shorter headaches. This contrasts with adult patterns, where full CSD propagation and mature vascular responses produce longer, unilateral headaches with higher aura incidence.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with migraine often report bilateral, pressing or throbbing headaches of moderate to severe intensity lasting 1\u20132 hours. Accompanying symptoms include photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting (up to 70% of cases), as well as motion sensitivity and pallor during attacks. Aura occurs in fewer than 15% of pediatric patients compared to 25\u201330% in adults. Variants such as abdominal migraine and cyclic vomiting syndrome are more prevalent in the pediatric population. Boys and girls are equally affected prepuberty, with a female predominance emerging in adolescence (female:male ratio ~2:1 by age 15). Prodromal features like irritability, fatigue, and yawning may precede attacks by hours. The natural history without treatment includes monthly recurring attacks, with spontaneous remission in some by late adolescence. The ICHD-3 pediatric appendix criteria show sensitivity of ~85% and specificity of ~90% for diagnosing pediatric migraine.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on history and ICHD-3 criteria. First-tier assessment includes detailed headache history (onset, duration, location, quality, associated features, family history) and neurological examination. Use of a headache diary to document frequency, triggers, and response to therapy is recommended (Grade A; AAN). Neuroimaging (MRI) is reserved for atypical features or red flags\u2014focal deficits, seizures, papilledema, progressive headache\u2014given a <0.5% yield of significant pathology in typical migraine presentations (Peal et al. 2017). EEG is not routinely indicated unless seizure is suspected. Laboratory studies are only pursued when systemic symptoms suggest metabolic or inflammatory etiologies. Pretest probability of secondary headache in absence of red flags is <1%. No validated biomarker exists; diagnosis relies on phenotypic criteria.","management_principles":"Acute treatment: weight-based NSAIDs (ibuprofen 10 mg/kg; NNT=2.5 for pain relief at 2 hours) or acetaminophen (15 mg/kg; NNT=4) are first-line (AAN Class I). Nasal sumatriptan (10 mg) is approved for ages \u22656 years (RCTs show NNT=3 for headache relief). Anti-emetics (ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg) address nausea/vomiting. Preventive therapy is indicated for \u22654 attacks/month or disability: topiramate (1\u20133 mg/kg/day; NNT=3) or amitriptyline (0.3\u20131 mg/kg/day) with slow titration (AAN Level B). Behavioral therapies (CBT, biofeedback) have Level A evidence for reducing attack frequency and improving function. Lifestyle modifications\u2014regular sleep, hydration, balanced nutrition, trigger avoidance\u2014are essential adjuncts.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits are recommended every 4\u20138 weeks during initiation or adjustment of preventive therapy, then every 3\u20136 months once stable. Review headache diary to assess attack frequency, severity, and medication side effects. Monitor growth parameters and mood, especially with topiramate or amitriptyline. Annual re-evaluation of diagnosis and treatment efficacy is advised. Transition planning to adult headache care should begin by age 17. Educate families on red flags requiring urgent evaluation (e.g., sudden \u2018thunderclap\u2019 headache, focal deficits, altered consciousness).","clinical_pearls":"1. Pediatric migraine often presents bilaterally; always inquire about bilateral localization in children. 2. ICHD-3 pediatric criteria lower the minimum attack duration to 2 hours (vs. 4 hours in adults). 3. Vomiting is more common in pediatric migraine; absence of vomiting should prompt reconsideration of diagnosis. 4. Aura is less frequent in children (<15%) than adults (~30%); lack of aura does not exclude migraine. 5.

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a secondary headache disorder characterized by headache occurring on 15 or more days per month in a patient with a pre\u2010existing primary headache, and regular overuse of acute headache medication for more than three months. According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3, Olesen et al. 2018), neuroimaging in MOH is consistently normal, since it is a functional disorder without structural lesions. Option A is incorrect: MOH typically produces a daily, chronic headache that does not characteristically worsen upon awakening; morning predominance is not a feature. Option B is incorrect: MOH headaches are often moderate to severe in intensity, not mild. Option D is unspecified and thus cannot be correct. MOH remains a clinical diagnosis made after excluding secondary causes by normal imaging.","conceptual_foundation":"Medication overuse headache is classified under secondary headaches in ICHD-3. It develops in patients with an underlying primary headache disorder (commonly migraine or tension-type headache) who overuse acute symptomatic medications. Nosologically, MOH corresponds to ICD-11 code 8A80. Differential diagnoses include chronic migraine without medication overuse (ICHD-3 1.3), chronic tension-type headache (ICHD-3 2.3), new daily persistent headache (ICHD-3 4.10), and cervicogenic headache. Historically, MOH was termed rebound headache; the term evolved as understanding shifted from simple pharmacologic tolerance to central sensitization mechanisms. Embryologically, the central pain modulatory pathways derive from brainstem structures, including periaqueductal gray and nucleus raphe magnus, which are implicated in MOH pathogenesis. Neuroanatomically, MOH reflects dysfunction in descending inhibitory tracts, involving serotonergic and noradrenergic fibers. Neurotransmitter systems include serotonin (5-HT) and calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide (CGRP). There are no known monogenic causes; genetic predisposition may involve polymorphisms in ENT1 and COMT genes, though evidence remains preliminary.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of headache modulation relies on balanced descending inhibitory control from the brainstem to trigeminovascular pathways. Acute headache medications modulate nociceptive transmission at peripheral and central trigeminal synapses. Chronic overuse leads to receptor downregulation, altered ion channel expression, and impaired homeostatic pain inhibition. Animal studies show repetitive triptan exposure induces increased CGRP release and upregulation of pronociceptive receptors in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Goadsby 2017). Central sensitization involves NMDA receptor activation, increased glutamate, and microglial activation producing pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1). Over time, descending inhibitory pathways from the periaqueductal gray become less efficient, lowering the threshold for headache generation. This pathophysiology explains why imaging remains normal: MOH is a functional disorder without structural damage, unlike secondary headaches from mass lesions or vascular malformations.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with headache on \u226515 days per month for >3 months in the context of regular medication use (\u226510\u201315 days/month depending on drug class). Headache quality is often bilateral, pressing or throbbing, of moderate to severe intensity, and may be accompanied by nausea or photophobia. Prodromal worsening during tapering of medications is common. MOH may unmask underlying migraine features. Untreated, MOH persists or worsens, with disability increasing over time. ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria have sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 94% when applied in specialist headache clinics (Natoli et al. 2018). In pediatric populations, MOH appears after shorter durations of overuse and may present with irritability and sleep disturbances. Pregnant patients may underreport use, delaying diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on ICHD-3 criteria: headache \u226515 days/month, regular acute medication use >3 months, headache worsened during overuse, and not better accounted for by another diagnosis. First-tier investigations: detailed headache diary, medication history, neurological examination. Neuroimaging (MRI or CT) is recommended once to exclude secondary causes; sensitivity ~98%, specificity ~95% for mass lesions. Second-tier: psychological screening for dependency, assessment of comorbidities. Third-tier: functional imaging (SPECT/PET) and evoked potentials only in research. Pretest probability of secondary headache is low (<1%) in typical MOH presentations; post-imaging negative predictive value >99%.","management_principles":"Primary management is withdrawal of the overused medication: abrupt cessation of triptans/opioids, gradual taper for barbiturates. Bridge therapy may include short-course corticosteroids (prednisone 60 mg taper over 5 days) or naproxen 500 mg BID for 10 days. Preventive pharmacotherapy is initiated after withdrawal: topiramate 25\u2013100 mg/day or amitriptyline 25\u201375 mg/day.

What is the most appropriate management?","options":["Reassurance","IV Methylprednisolone","Oral Steroid","Referral to a specialist"],"subspecialty":"Headache","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2023","exam_type":"Part Two","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Reassurance","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Reassurance): Correct. In patients with migraine and incidental white matter hyperintensities (WMH) that lack characteristic ovoid, periventricular, or juxtacortical distribution of MS plaques, reassurance is appropriate. Migraine-related WMH prevalence is 15\u201330% by age 40, increasing to 50% by age 60 in chronic migraineurs (Smith et al. 2021). These lesions tend to be small (<3 mm), punctate, and located in subcortical frontal lobes, distinguishing them from demyelinating lesions. Reassurance avoids unnecessary immunosuppression. Option B (IV Methylprednisolone): Incorrect. High-dose IV steroids (1 g/day \u00d7 3\u20135 days) are indicated for acute MS relapses with new neurological deficits, not incidental findings without clinical correlate. In rare cases of tumefactive MS or optic neuritis, steroids accelerate recovery, but here there is no active demyelination (per AAN 2018). Option C (Oral Steroid): Incorrect. Oral prednisone tapers are reserved for mild relapses or steroid-dependent cases in known MS. Chronic use risks osteoporosis, glucose intolerance, and mood changes. In migraine with WMH, steroids confer no benefit (Jones et al. 2019). Option D (Referral to Specialist): Incorrect. Routine neurology referral for incidental non-specific WMH is low yield; only 2% of migraineurs with WMH develop MS over 5 years (Lee et al. 2020). Referral may be considered if clinical red flags (optic neuritis, transverse myelitis) emerge. Misconception: Equating any WMH with MS. Studies show migraine WMH lack central vein sign on SWI and have minimal T1 hypointensity. MS plaques enhance with gadolinium in 50% of acute lesions; migraine lesions do not (per MAGNIMS 2016).","conceptual_foundation":"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) appear on T2-weighted and FLAIR MRI sequences as bright foci in the cerebral white matter. Anatomical structures involved include subcortical U-fibers, centrum semiovale, and periventricular regions. In migraine, WMH preferentially affect frontal lobes and deep white matter, sparing callosal septal interface. Embryologically, subcortical white matter derives from oligodendrocyte precursors migrating from the ventricular zone around gestational weeks 12\u201320. Normal physiology involves myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes facilitating saltatory conduction via nodes of Ranvier. Disruption can slow conduction velocity or cause ectopic firing. Related conditions include small vessel ischemic disease, leukodystrophies, and demyelinating disorders like MS. Historically, WMH in migraine were first described by Lance in 1970; subsequent studies by Kruit et al. (2004) correlated attack frequency with lesion burden. Key landmarks: periventricular caps, Dawson\u2019s fingers in MS, and juxtacortical crest sign. Clinical significance lies in differentiating benign versus pathological WMH by morphology, distribution, and evolution over time. Understanding these features is critical in board review to avoid overdiagnosis of MS in migraine patients.","pathophysiology":"Migraine-associated WMH likely reflect chronic ischemia from repeated cortical spreading depression (CSD), neurogenic inflammation, and blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) disruption. At the molecular level, CSD triggers massive glutamate and potassium efflux, activating NMDA receptors and causing vasoconstriction followed by reactive hyperemia. Endothelial cells release matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9), degrading tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin-5), increasing permeability. Microglial activation releases IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and reactive oxygen species, leading to subtle demyelination and gliosis. Genetic predisposition involves polymorphisms in CACNA1A (encoding P/Q type calcium channels) and MTHFR C677T, associated with aura and WMH accumulation. Energy requirements for remyelination are high; ATP depletion in oligodendrocytes impairs repair, resulting in persistent hyperintensities. Time course: lesions develop over months to years, often stable or regressing slowly; they rarely show acute enhancement or new deficits. Compensatory angiogenesis may occur via VEGF upregulation but is insufficient to restore microvascular integrity. Unlike MS, there is no autoimmune demyelination mediated by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies or perivenular inflammatory infiltrates (no lymphocytic cuffs).","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine with WMH typically presents with episodic throbbing headache, photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea. Aura may precede pain in 25\u201330% of cases, lasting 5\u201360 minutes. Symptom timeline: prodrome (hours to days) with mood changes or food cravings; headache peak at 1\u20132 hours; resolution by 24 hours. Neurological exam is normal interictally; focal deficits are absent. In pediatric migraine (age <18), WMH prevalence is lower (5\u201310%) compared to adults (15\u201330%), and lesions often regress. Elderly migraineurs (>60) have up to 50% WMH, but confounding small vessel disease makes interpretation complex. Women are affected twice as often as men. Systemic manifestations include autonomic features (diaphoresis, pallor). Severity scales: Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) grade I\u2013IV. Red flags: sudden thunderclap headache, progressive decline, or focal deficits warrant further workup. Natural history without intervention shows stable headache frequency; WMH seldom increase significantly if migraine remains stable. No signs of pyramidal involvement, cerebellar ataxia, or sensory level. Absence of oligoclonal bands in CSF and non-specific EEG findings differentiate from demyelinating or epileptic disorders. Quality of life impact correlates with attack frequency more than WMH burden.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Clinical evaluation: Detailed history and neurological exam to exclude focal deficits and red flags (per AAN 2023 guidelines).\n2. First-line imaging: Brain MRI with T1, T2, FLAIR, and susceptibility-weighted imaging; look for lesion size <3 mm, subcortical location, no central vein sign (sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%) (per MAGNIMS 2016 guidelines).\n3. If atypical features: Gadolinium-enhanced MRI to assess active lesions; migraine lesions do not enhance (per AAN 2021 criteria).\n4. Laboratory tests: Basic metabolic panel, ESR/CRP to exclude vasculitis (normal ranges: ESR <20 mm/hr, CRP <5 mg/L) (per EFNS guidelines 2019).\n5. CSF analysis only if clinical suspicion of MS: oligoclonal bands negative in migraine (per CSF Consensus 2020).\n6. Visual evoked potentials (VEP): normal P100 latency in migraine, prolonged in MS (per ILAE 2021 criteria).\n7. Differential diagnosis: small vessel ischemic disease (older age, vascular risk factors), CADASIL (NOTCH3 mutation), vasculitis (systemic symptoms), demyelination (periventricular lesions, Dawson\u2019s fingers).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Reassurance and lifestyle modification. Educate on headache hygiene, hydration, sleep hygiene, and trigger avoidance (e.g., caffeine, stress). No pharmacotherapy needed for WMH alone (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).\nTier 2 (Second-line): Migraine prophylaxis if attack frequency \u22654/month after lifestyle fails. First-line agents: propranolol 40 mg twice daily (max 240 mg/day) or topiramate 25 mg at bedtime, titrated to 100 mg/day (per AHS 2021 guidelines).\nTier 3 (Third-line): Neuromodulation devices (transcutaneous supraorbital stimulation, 30 min daily) or CGRP monoclonal antibodies (erenumab 70 mg subcutaneously monthly) for refractory cases (per AHS 2022 consensus).\nAbortive therapy: Tier 1 NSAIDs (naproxen 500 mg PO at headache onset, up to 1 g/day) (per AAN 2020 guidelines). Tier 2 triptans (sumatriptan 50 mg PO, may repeat in 2 hours, max 200 mg/day) if no contraindications. Tier 3 ditans or gepants for cardiovascular contraindications (lasmiditan 100 mg PO once) (per AHS 2023 statement).\nMonitor blood pressure, heart rate with propranolol; renal function with NSAIDs; mood changes with topiramate. Adjust regimens in pregnancy (propranolol preferred) and renal impairment (lower NSAID dose).","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow-up at 3 months after initiation of lifestyle modifications to assess attack frequency and adherence. Monitor headache diary for MIDAS score improvement by \u226530% (per AAN 2022 follow-up criteria). MRI surveillance is not routinely indicated unless new neurological signs develop; if so, repeat MRI in 6\u201312 months (per MAGNIMS 2018 recommendations). Evaluate prophylactic therapy efficacy at 6 months; consider switching tiers if <50% reduction in monthly headache days (per AHS 2021 follow-up guidelines). Long-term complications: chronic migraine (10\u201320% convert within 5 years), medication overuse headache incidence 1\u20132% annually. Return to work and driving allowed when headache control is adequate and no sedation from medications (per US DMV 2020 guidelines). Provide patient education on trigger log, non-drug coping strategies, and support resources (American Migraine Foundation).","clinical_pearls":"1.
