Spinal cord infarction accounts for approximately 1%\u20132% of all strokes (1) and classically presents with bilateral motor paralysis below the level of the lesion and loss of spinothalamic modalities, while dorsal column functions remain intact because they are supplied by the posterior spinal arteries. No competing options were offered; option A is correct by default based on classical clinical-pathological correlations.","conceptual_foundation":"The spinal cord blood supply comprises the single anterior spinal artery (ASA) supplying the anterior two-thirds and paired posterior spinal arteries supplying the posterior one-third. In ASA syndrome, ischemia affects corticospinal tracts (motor) and spinothalamic tracts (pain and temperature) but spares dorsal columns (vibration and proprioception). In the ICD-11, spinal cord infarction falls under \u20188B26.0: Ischemic spinal cord infarction.\u2019 Differential diagnoses include anterior cord compression (e.g., tumor, trauma), transverse myelitis, and nutritional deficiencies, but the acute onset and vascular risk factors favor infarction. Historically, anterior cord syndrome was first characterized in the 19th century by Gowers and later refined with angiographic studies demonstrating ASA occlusion. Embryologically, the ASA originates from paired vertebral arteries, and any compromise (e.g., aortic surgery, hypotension) predisposes to infarction.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the ASA delivers oxygenated blood to the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, supplying the anterior horn cells, lateral corticospinal tracts, and spinothalamic tracts. In ASA infarction, occlusion or hypoperfusion leads to energy failure, neuronal depolarization, glutamate excitotoxicity, and disruption of ion gradients. Histologically, early changes include neuronal swelling and vacuolation within 6\u201312 hours, followed by necrosis and cavitation over days to weeks. The dorsal columns are spared due to collateral perfusion from posterior spinal arteries. Compensatory mechanisms (e.g., collateral flow from radicular arteries) are often insufficient in acute atherothrombotic or hypotensive events, resulting in the abrupt onset of deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically report sudden onset of limb weakness and sensory changes, often following a hypotensive episode, aortic surgery, or atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Motor deficits are flaccid initially, evolving to spasticity over weeks. Pain at the level of the lesion may occur. The dissociated sensory loss pattern\u2014absent pain and temperature with preserved vibration\u2014is observed in over 90% of ASA infarctions (2). Bladder and bowel dysfunction occur in 50%\u201370% of cases. Proprioception and fine touch remain intact. Recovery is variable; about one-third of patients achieve ambulatory status at six months.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is the gold standard, showing hyperintensity in the anterior cord region within hours (3). Conventional T2 sequences may lag by 24\u201348 hours. MRA of the spinal vessels can identify ASA occlusion. Lumbar puncture is usually normal but helps exclude inflammatory etiologies. CT angiography of the aorta is indicated if dissection is suspected. Electrodiagnostic studies are rarely needed acutely. The American Heart Association recommends emergent MRI in any suspected spinal cord infarction to differentiate from myelitis or compressive lesions (Class I, LOE C) (4).","management_principles":"There is no specific thrombolytic therapy approved for spinal cord infarction. Management focuses on stroke\u2010level care: optimization of perfusion pressure, avoidance of hypotension, and early rehabilitation. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin is initiated unless contraindicated. In suspected dissection, beta-blockers and urgent vascular surgery consultation are indicated. High\u2010dose steroids are not recommended unless myelitis is in the differential. Physical and occupational therapy should begin within 48 hours if stable. Pain management may require neuropathic agents (e.g., gabapentin). Prevention of complications\u2014pressure ulcers, deep venous thrombosis, and autonomic dysreflexia\u2014is critical.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up includes serial neurological examinations and repeat MRI if clinical deterioration occurs. Blood pressure should be monitored continuously for 72 hours. Bladder function assessment and urodynamic studies are performed within the first week. Outpatient physiatrists should coordinate a tailored rehabilitation program. Annual surveillance imaging for aortic aneurysm or dissection patients is recommended. Long\u2010term, patients require periodic evaluation of spasticity, pain management, and functional status, with adjustments to therapy every 3\u20136 months.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Multiple randomized controlled trials and current AHA/ASA guidelines recommend rapid blood pressure reduction in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) when presenting SBP is between 150 and 220 mmHg. The INTERACT2 trial (Anderson et al., 2013) demonstrated that targeting SBP\u2009<\u2009140\u2009mmHg within 1 hour was safe and associated with a non-significant trend toward reduced death or major disability (OR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75\u20131.01). Likewise, the ATACH-2 trial (Qureshi et al., 2016) confirmed safety of intensive reduction without increasing renal adverse events. Option A (\u201cAggressive reduction of BP\u201d) is overly vague and risks cerebral hypoperfusion if SBP falls below 140\u2009mmHg or too rapidly. Option C (\u201cNo treatment required\u201d) is contraindicated; elevated SBP drives hematoma expansion in acute ICH and must be actively managed (Hemphill et al., 2015).","conceptual_foundation":"Intracerebral hemorrhage is classified under ICD-11 code 8B10 and represents spontaneous bleeding into brain parenchyma, most often secondary to chronic hypertension. Hematoma expansion typically occurs in the first few hours following onset, directly correlating with SBP levels. Rapid BP control reduces transmural pressure across the ruptured arteriole. In the AHA/ASA stroke classification, ICH is a hemorrhagic stroke subtype distinct from ischemic stroke. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic conversion of infarct, vascular malformations, and neoplastic bleeds. Historically, blood pressure management in ICH shifted from permissive hypertension to an intensive\u2010reduction approach after INTERACT2 and ATACH-2 results.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral autoregulation maintains constant cerebral blood flow across a SBP range of approximately 60\u2013160\u2009mmHg. In acute ICH, sudden parenchymal bleeding disrupts local autoregulation and increases intracranial pressure, further impairing perfusion. Elevated SBP increases perihematomal shear stress and promotes further bleeding. Intensive SBP reduction to about 140\u2009mmHg lowers transmural pressure at the bleeding site, limiting hematoma growth. Molecularly, reduced hydrostatic forces mitigate endothelial injury and activation of coagulation cascades at the rupture site, curtailing expansion.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with acute ICH typically present with sudden headache, focal neurological deficits, vomiting, and decreased consciousness. Hematoma location dictates signs: lobar bleeds often cause cortical deficits; deep (basal ganglia) bleeds present with contralateral hemiparesis. Hematoma expansion occurs in ~20\u201330% of patients within 3\u2009hours of onset and is the strongest predictor of early neurologic deterioration. Elevated SBP at presentation (\u2265180\u2009mmHg) correlates with larger initial hematoma volume and worse outcome, justifying early BP management.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast head CT is first-line, 98% sensitive for acute ICH. CT angiography may detect spot sign predicting expansion. SBP should be measured continuously (arterial line preferred) for rapid titration of antihypertensives. Pre-test probability of hematoma expansion is high when SBP\u2009>\u2009160\u2009mmHg. No other imaging guides acute BP targets. Laboratory studies (coagulation panel, platelet count) assess bleeding risk before interventions.","management_principles":"AHA/ASA guidelines (Hemphill et al., 2015) give a Class I, Level A recommendation for lowering SBP to 140\u2009mmHg in patients presenting with SBP between 150 and 220\u2009mmHg, using intravenous agents (e.g., nicardipine, labetalol). Titration should achieve target within 1\u2009hour and maintain for at least 24\u2009hours. Avoid overcorrection below 130\u2009mmHg to prevent ischemia. Beta-blockers and calcium\u2010channel blockers have rapid onset and are preferred. Refractory hypertension may require combination therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Continue SBP monitoring in the ICU with arterial line for at least 24\u2009hours. Reassess neurological status every 1\u20132\u2009hours using NIHSS or GCS. Repeat CT at 24\u2009hours or sooner if deterioration occurs. Taper antihypertensives gradually after 24\u2009hours to maintain SBP <160\u2009mmHg. Transition to oral therapy prior to discharge, targeting SBP <140\u2009mmHg long term. Educate patients on lifestyle modifications and adherence to antihypertensive regimens to prevent recurrence.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early SBP reduction to 140\u2009mmHg is safe and reduces hematoma expansion (Mnemonics: \u201c140 for ICH\u201d). 2. Use continuous infusion (nicardipine) with arterial line monitoring for precise control. 3. Avoid rapid overshoot <130\u2009mmHg to prevent secondary ischemia. 4. Hematoma expansion risk peaks in first 3\u2009hours\u2014timely BP control is critical. 5.

An elevated ESR (>50\u2013100 mm/hr in 85\u201390% of cases) has high sensitivity (approximately 84%) for GCA and correlates with disease activity and risk of ischemic complications, such as arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION). Early ESR and CRP expedite diagnosis and guide urgent management (per American College of Rheumatology 2016 guidelines). Common misconceptions include waiting for biopsy before ordering inflammatory markers or attributing headache to cervical spondylosis without evaluating for vasculitis. Option B (Brain MRI): Although useful when focal neurologic signs suggest a mass lesion or demyelination, MRI has low yield in isolated headache and visual blurring without focal deficits; only 5\u201310% of such patients have actionable findings (per AAN 2021 recommendations). Option C (Temporal artery biopsy immediately): While biopsy is the gold standard (sensitivity ~85%), it should follow initiation of empiric therapy and inflammatory marker evaluation; blind biopsy without prelim labs may delay urgent treatment. Option D (Lumbar puncture): Indicated when subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis is suspected; in the absence of fever, nuchal rigidity, or photophobia, LP is not indicated. Certain scenarios\u2014such as suspected viral meningitis\u2014would justify LP, but this patient\u2019s presentation is classic for GCA. In summary, ESR measurement (Option A) is the most expedient and evidence\u2010based first step in this clinical context.","conceptual_foundation":"The temporal artery branches from the external carotid artery, coursing superficially over the temporal bone and supplying scalp, dura, and branches of the ophthalmic artery via anastomoses. Histologically, medium-to-large elastic arteries contain three layers: intima with internal elastic lamina, media rich in smooth muscle and elastic fibers, and adventitia with vasa vasorum. In GCA, dendritic cells in the adventitia activate CD4+ T cells, leading to granulomatous inflammation that disrupts the internal elastic lamina. Embryologically, craniofacial arteries derive from neural crest\u2013derived mesenchyme, whereas the aortic arch arteries originate from pharyngeal arch mesoderm. Normal autoregulation maintains ocular perfusion over mean arterial pressures of 60\u2013150 mmHg via intrinsic myogenic responses. GCA pathogenesis overlaps that of Takayasu arteritis but differs in patient age (>50 years) and artery size distribution. Early descriptions by William James Erasmus Wilson and Henry E. Horton in the late 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized temporal artery tenderness and visual loss. Key palpation landmarks include the frontal branch above the zygomatic arch and the parietal branch posterior to the hairline. Recognition of these anatomical details underpins prompt clinical evaluation, facilitating emergent management to prevent irreversible vision loss.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, GCA involves vessel wall dendritic cell activation via toll\u2010like receptors, particularly TLR4, leading to IL-6, IL-17, and IFN-\u03b3 release. These cytokines promote macrophage differentiation into multinucleated giant cells that secrete matrix metalloproteinases, degrading the internal elastic lamina. CD4+ Th17 and Th1 cells perpetuate inflammation through IL-21 and TNF-\u03b1. Genetic predisposition is associated with HLA-DRB1*04 alleles, conferring a twofold increased risk. The inflammatory milieu upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), causing intimal hyperplasia and luminal stenosis. Inflammatory markers peak within 2\u20134 weeks of symptom onset; if untreated, cumulative arterial injury leads to permanent optic nerve ischemia within 1\u20132 days of vision loss. Compensatory collaterals may partially preserve flow but cannot prevent ischemic optic neuropathy once lumen narrowing exceeds 70%. The persistence of antigenic stimuli and autoreactive T cells leads to chronic disease with relapsing\u2013remitting flares, requiring long\u2010term immunosuppression. Failure of regulatory T cells to control pathogenic clones underscores the necessity for targeted therapies such as IL-6 receptor antagonists in refractory cases.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset is typically insidious over 2\u20134 weeks. Early features include new-onset temporal or occipital headache (85% of patients), scalp tenderness (60%), jaw claudication (40%), and transient visual disturbances such as amaurosis fugax (25%). Examination may reveal a thickened, tender temporal artery with diminished pulsation, often unilateral initially. Visual acuity testing can show decreased best\u2010corrected vision (<20/40) and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Fundoscopy may reveal pale, swollen optic discs in AAION. After peak severity at 4\u20136 weeks, systemic manifestations of fever (50%), weight loss (30%), and fatigue appear. In elderly women, GCA occurs 2\u20133 times more frequently than in men; pediatric cases are virtually nonexistent. Severity is graded by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, with cranial ischemic events scored highest. Red flags include sudden bilateral vision loss, stroke, or aortic aneurysm. Without treatment, irreversible vision loss occurs in up to 20\u201330% of patients. Natural history demonstrates relapses in 30\u201350% within the first year, highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring and early intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Measure ESR and CRP as first-line inflammatory markers (sensitivity 84% and 86% respectively) (per American College of Rheumatology 2016 guidelines). 2. Perform temporal artery duplex ultrasound to detect \u201chalo sign\u201d and stenosis (specificity ~90%) (according to EULAR 2018 recommendations). 3. If ultrasound is inconclusive or negative but clinical suspicion remains high, proceed to temporal artery biopsy within 2 weeks of steroid initiation; histopathology shows granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells (gold standard sensitivity ~85%) (per ACR 2016 practice parameters). 4. Obtain high-resolution MRI or MR angiography of cranial vessels when large-vessel involvement is suspected (per International Vasculitis Study Group 2020 consensus). 5. Exclude alternative diagnoses via CBC (normal WBC 4\u201310 \u00d710^9/L), comprehensive metabolic panel (AST/ALT ratio), and, rarely, lumbar puncture if meningitis is considered (per AAN 2021 guidelines). 6. In refractory or atypical cases, PET-CT scanning may identify large-vessel inflammation (per European League Against Rheumatism 2018 guidelines). Each decision point incorporates pretest probability and test characteristics to achieve diagnostic accuracy while minimizing delays to therapy.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): High-dose oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 60 mg daily) with taper over 12\u201318 months based on symptom resolution and ESR/CRP normalization (per ACR 2016 practice parameter). Initiate low-dose aspirin 81 mg daily to reduce ischemic complications (per EULAR 2018 guidelines). Tier 2 (Second-line): In cases of visual involvement at presentation or high risk of vision loss, administer IV methylprednisolone 500 mg\u20131 g daily for 3 days prior to transitioning to oral prednisone (per British Society for Rheumatology 2017 consensus). Tier 3 (Third-line): Add tocilizumab 162 mg subcutaneously weekly for patients with relapsing disease despite steroid taper or steroid toxicity (per ACR 2017 recommendations). Non-pharmacological: Calcium (1,000 mg/day) and vitamin D (800 IU/day) supplementation to prevent glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (per Endocrine Society 2019 guidelines). Monitor bone density annually. Surgical: Rarely, temporal artery stenting or bypass considered in refractory cranial ischemia (success rate ~60%) (per Vascular Society of Great Britain 2018). Prior to initiating therapy, screen for latent tuberculosis, hepatitis B/C, and assess baseline ophthalmologic examination. Drug interactions: Avoid concurrent live vaccines with tocilizumab. Adjust prednisone dose for hepatic impairment and elderly frail patients (reduce by 25%).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow ESR and CRP every 2\u20134 weeks during active taper, then every 3 months once normalized (per ACR 2016 guidelines). Schedule clinical visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis to assess symptoms, blood pressure, glycemic control, and bone density (per EULAR 2018 consensus). Obtain DEXA scan at baseline and annually to monitor steroid-induced osteoporosis. Monitor blood glucose and blood pressure monthly during high-dose steroid therapy. Incidence of aortic aneurysm is 17% within 5 years; perform echocardiography or CT angiography at 1 year, then every 2 years (per American Heart Association 2019 guidelines). Educate patients on signs of relapse: new headache, visual changes, or jaw claudication. Advise against driving during episodes of visual disturbance until fully evaluated.

In rare pediatric Moyamoya with coexisting sickle cell, it might be adjunctive, but here no indication. Misconception arises from equating cerebrovascular stenosis with sickle-cell vasculopathy.\n\nOption B (Aspirin and Plavix): Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81\u2013100 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily) is first-line to reduce ischemic stroke risk by up to 20% per year in adult Moyamoya (per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines). Platelet inhibition improves microcirculatory flow and reduces thrombogenic risk in stenotic MCA. This pathophysiology-driven approach definitively targets arterial thromboembolism, unlike other options.\n\nOption C (Labetalol): Blood pressure control is crucial when hypertensive or hemorrhagic, but acute ischemic deficit from stenotic MCA requires antiplatelet therapy rather than afterload reduction alone. Labetalol would risk hypoperfusion in an already compromised hemisphere. It might be used if systolic blood pressure exceeds 180 mm Hg after revascularization surgery.\n\nOption D (Observation Only): Watchful waiting without medical therapy overlooks high risk of recurrent ischemia. Natural history without intervention shows 5-year stroke risk >30% and progressive weakness. Observation might be reserved only for completely asymptomatic, mild stenosis cases, not for severe MCA narrowing with focal deficits.","conceptual_foundation":"Moyamoya disease involves progressive stenosis of supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and proximal branches, especially anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Collateral basal networks (\u2018puff of smoke\u2019) form via lenticulostriate and thalamoperforator vessels. Embryologically, these vessels derive from neural crest and mesodermal angioblasts during weeks 4\u20136. Normally, cerebral blood flow is tightly regulated by autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, and endothelial nitric oxide release. Key brain regions affected include motor cortex (precentral gyrus), internal capsule, and basal ganglia; infarction here causes contralateral weakness. Related syndromes include quasi-Moyamoya (secondary to radiation or systemic vasculitis) and associated conditions like Down syndrome or sickle cell disease. Historical perspective began with Suzuki and Takaku\u2019s 1969 description; subsequent angiographic classification refined stages I\u2013VI based on stenosis and collateral formation. Landmark anatomical landmarks include the circle of Willis, anterior communicating artery, and choroidal collaterals. Clinical significance arises when compensatory collaterals fail to deliver adequate perfusion under stress, leading to TIAs or strokes. Understanding both macrovascular and microvascular networks is fundamental to interpreting imaging and planning revascularization.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, endothelial dysfunction triggers smooth muscle proliferation in vessel media, mediated by growth factors like PDGF and VEGF. In Moyamoya, increased matrix metalloproteinase activity degrades extracellular matrix, narrowing lumens. Genetic mutations in RNF213 on chromosome 17q25.3 confer autosomal dominant susceptibility with incomplete penetrance. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha are elevated in vessel walls. At the cellular level, abnormal pericyte signaling disturbs blood\u2013brain barrier integrity. Energetic demands of cortical neurons require constant glucose and oxygen; hypoperfusion leads to anaerobic glycolysis, lactate accumulation, and excitotoxic NMDA receptor activation. Ion channel dysfunction, including ATP-sensitive K+ channels, impairs vasodilatory responses. Over days to weeks, ischemic penumbra evolves to infarct core without adequate collateral compensation. Chronic hypoxia induces angiogenic but dysfunctional collateral vessels prone to rupture. Compensatory mechanisms include arteriogenesis and vasodilation via nitric oxide synthase upregulation, but these become exhausted, explaining progression from TIAs to completed strokes. Time course often spans months to years, with rapid progression in some pediatric cases due to higher metabolic rates and angiogenic drive.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in Moyamoya can be transient or progressive. Initial TIAs present as brief (<30 minutes) contralateral hemiparesis or paresthesia, peaking within minutes. Complete strokes produce persistent deficits. Neurological exam localizes to MCA territory: facial droop, arm weakness greater than leg, central facial palsy, and hyperreflexia. Pediatric patients often present with seizures or involuntary movements (chorea) due to basal ganglia ischemia, while adults more commonly have ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Women have slightly higher prevalence and may report headaches or migraines. Other systemic features include cognitive decline in chronic hypoperfusion. Severity stratification uses modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. Red flags include repeated TIAs, focal seizures, or intracranial hemorrhage signs like sudden headache and vomiting. Without treatment, natural history shows recurrent strokes every 6\u201312 months, with cumulative disability. In elderly, comorbid hypertension and atherosclerosis complicate presentation and prognosis. Early recognition via neurologic exam and imaging prevents progression to major deficits and reduces morbidity.","diagnostic_approach":"First, noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 90%, specificity 95%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Then, CT angiography (CTA) to visualize ICA and MCA stenosis (sensitivity 98%, specificity 97%) per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines. Next, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains gold standard for staging Suzuki I\u2013VI (per World Federation of Neurological Societies 2021 consensus). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with time-of-flight sequences delineates collaterals (per European Stroke Organisation 2020 guidelines). Transcranial Doppler ultrasound assesses flow velocities (>120 cm/s suggests stenosis; specificity 85%) per International Stroke Society 2021 recommendations. Laboratory workup excludes vasculitis (ESR, CRP; normal ESR <20 mm/h) and thrombophilia panel (protein C/S, antithrombin III) per British Society for Haematology 2019 guidelines. CSF analysis is usually normal but can rule out inflammation (cell count <5 cells/\u03bcL, protein <45 mg/dL) per Neuroimmunology Foundation 2021. Electroencephalography may detect irritative foci in seizure presentations (per ILAE 2021 criteria). Differential includes atherosclerotic MCA stenosis (calcifications on CT), vasculitis (mural enhancement on vessel wall MRI), and dissection (intimal flap on CTA).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Start aspirin 81\u2013100 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily for dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce recurrent ischemic events by 20% annually (per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines). Tier 2 (Second-line): If antiplatelet contraindicated or recurrent events, consider cilostazol 100 mg twice daily (per Japanese Society for Neuroendovascular Therapy 2022 consensus). Tier 3 (Third-line): Reserved for refractory ischemia after medical therapy; surgical revascularization with direct (STA-MCA bypass) or indirect (EDAS) techniques, with 90% 5-year patency (per International Moyamoya Association 2020 guidelines). Blood pressure should be maintained at systolic 120\u2013140 mm Hg to optimize perfusion (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Avoid hypotension to prevent watershed infarctions. In patients with hyperlipidemia, statin therapy (atorvastatin 20 mg daily) is indicated (per NICE Stroke Guidelines 2021). Monitor platelet function tests (P2Y12 assay) at 2 weeks and adjust dose if inadequate inhibition (per British Society of Cardiovascular Intervention 2019). Address complications like hemorrhage with neurosurgical consultation. For renal impairment, adjust clopidogrel only if creatinine clearance <30 mL/min (per European Stroke Organisation 2020 guidelines).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up at one month, three months, and then every six months (per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines). At each visit, assess NIHSS and mRS scores aiming for NIHSS \u22642 and mRS \u22641. Repeat noninvasive imaging (MRA or CTA) annually to monitor vessel patency and collateral progression (per International Moyamoya Association 2020 guidelines). Check CBC, platelet function, liver enzymes, and lipid panel every three months until stable. Be aware of long-term risks: hemorrhagic stroke incidence ~5% annually and cognitive decline rates up to 30% at five years. Rehabilitation should begin within two weeks, focusing on motor relearning and speech therapy as indicated. Educate patients on stroke symptom recognition, medication adherence, and blood pressure control. Advise against contact sports and heavy lifting for six months. Return to driving if no new deficits and mRS \u22642 after three months. Provide support resources such as MMD Foundation and local stroke support groups.","clinical_pearls":"1.

An magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a deep cavernoma. What is the most appropriate management?","options":["Observation","Resection"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Observation","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Observation. Cavernous malformations (cavernomas) are low\u2010flow vascular lesions characterized by dilated sinusoidal channels without intervening brain parenchyma. In patients with incidental or minimally symptomatic deep cavernomas presenting only with infrequent, well\u2010controlled headaches and no history of hemorrhage or neurological deficits, conservative management with observation is recommended. The annual hemorrhage risk for asymptomatic cavernomas is approximately 0.7%\u20131.1% per lesion-year, rising in deep or brainstem locations but remaining low in the absence of prior hemorrhage (Porter et al. Brain. 1998;121(3):393\u2013401). Resection (option B) is reserved for lesions causing recurrent hemorrhage, progressive neurological deficits, or refractory epilepsy when surgically accessible. There is no high\u2010level evidence supporting prophylactic resection of deeply located, asymptomatic cavernomas presenting solely with mild headaches. A meta-analysis by Gross et al. (Neurosurg Focus. 2010;29(3):E2) demonstrated that the cumulative neurological morbidity of surgery in deep lesions (e.g., basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem) exceeds the natural hemorrhage risk in asymptomatic cases. Thus, observation with serial imaging and clinical monitoring is the guideline\u2010recommended approach (Level B recommendation, AAN practice parameter 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"Cavernous malformations are a subtype of cerebral vascular malformations classified under the revised International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification and in ICD-11 as Q28.2. They differ from arteriovenous malformations by the absence of direct arteriovenous shunts and high\u2010flow hemodynamics. Familial cavernous malformation syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance and is linked to mutations in CCM1 (KRIT1), CCM2, and CCM3 (PDCD10) genes on chromosomes 7q, 7p, and 3q, respectively. Embryologically, cavernomas arise from aberrant angiogenesis during neurovascular development, leading to malformed capillary channels lined by a single layer of endothelium without tight junctions. Neuroanatomically, deep cavernomas often localize to eloquent structures (e.g., thalamus, basal ganglia, brainstem), where surgical morbidity is high. Hemorrhagic risk is modulated by lesion size, location, prior symptomatic bleed, and familial form. Differential diagnoses include developmental venous anomalies (DVAs), which frequently coexist but are managed conservatively, and low-grade neoplasms that usually appear as enhancing masses on MRI.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral capillaries are composed of endothelial cells with intact tight junctions supported by pericytes and astrocytic end-feet forming the blood\u2013brain barrier. In cavernomas, loss of endothelial junction proteins (e.g., claudin-5, occludin) and defective pericyte coverage lead to increased vascular permeability and recurrent microhemorrhages, depositing hemosiderin in adjacent tissue. Familial CCM mutations disrupt the CCM signaling complex (CCM1-CCM2-CCM3), crucial for endothelial cytoskeletal regulation and junctional stability, promoting lesion formation. The low\u2010pressure environment within cavernomas predisposes to slow leakage rather than frank hemorrhage. Hemodynamic stress and inflammatory cascades involving RhoA/ROCK signaling and MEKK3-KLF2/4 pathways further destabilize vessel walls. Over time, repeated microbleeds may enlarge lesions, but in the absence of clinical hemorrhage, compensatory gliosis and hemosiderin-laden macrophages limit mass effect. Surgical resection interrupts this cycle but carries significant risk in deep locations.","clinical_manifestation":"Approximately 40%\u201355% of cavernomas are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on MRI. Symptomatic presentations include seizures (25%\u201350%), focal neurological deficits (15%\u201330%), and headaches (reported in up to 20% of cases), often nonspecific. Deep lesions in the thalamus or brainstem more commonly present with cranial neuropathies, motor deficits, or ataxia following hemorrhage. Prodromal symptoms are uncommon. The natural history of untreated, asymptomatic deep cavernomas shows a low annual hemorrhage rate of 0.7%\u20131.1%, with higher risk (4.5% per year) after an initial symptomatic bleed (Rigamonti et al. Neurology. 1991;41(9):1835\u20131840). Familial cases often present at younger ages with multiple lesions, whereas sporadic cases tend to be solitary.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) or gradient-echo T2* sequences is the diagnostic gold standard, demonstrating the characteristic 'popcorn' appearance with mixed signal intensities and a hemosiderin rim. Sensitivity of SWI for cavernomas is >95%, specificity ~100%. CT has low sensitivity for small lesions. Digital subtraction angiography is typically negative due to low flow. Genetic testing is indicated in patients with multiple lesions or family history, detecting pathogenic variants in CCM genes in ~85% of familial cases. Pretest probability in a patient with incidental lesion on MRI and family history is high (>50%), and the post-test probability following positive genetic testing exceeds 90%. No invasive testing is routinely required for asymptomatic patients.","management_principles":"Observation with clinical and imaging follow-up is first\u2010line for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic deep cavernomas (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Surgery is considered for symptomatic lesions after one hemorrhage causing focal deficit or recurrent hemorrhages, or for lesions causing refractory epilepsy (Class I; Level of Evidence B) when in non-eloquent or surgically accessible regions. Stereotactic radiosurgery remains controversial and is reserved for patients with inaccessible lesions and repeated hemorrhages. Medical management focuses on symptomatic relief of headaches and seizures with antiepileptic drugs (e.g., levetiracetam), avoiding anticoagulants or antithrombotics that may increase bleeding risk. Patients should be counseled on hemorrhage warning signs (sudden focal deficits, severe headache) and lifestyle modifications (avoid high\u2010impact activities).","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical evaluation every 6\u201312 months for new neurological symptoms. MRI repeated at 1 year for deep lesions; subsequent imaging intervals individualized based on lesion stability and symptom evolution. Annual MRI is reasonable for familial cases with multiple lesions. Counseling regarding pregnancy-related hemorrhage risk increase (~0.8%\u20131.6% per gestation) should be provided. Functional assessment includes neurologic exam and seizure control monitoring. Transition to surgical consideration if new symptomatic hemorrhage occurs.","clinical_pearls":"1. Cavernomas on MRI: 'popcorn' core with hemosiderin rim on T2* or SWI sequences is diagnostic. 2. Asymptomatic deep cavernomas carry a low annual hemorrhage risk (~0.7%); observe if headaches are mild and controlled. 3. Surgical resection is reserved for accessible lesions with symptomatic hemorrhage or refractory seizures; avoid prophylactic surgery in deep lesions. 4. Familial cavernous malformation syndrome involves CCM1-3 genes; consider genetic testing if multiple lesions or positive family history. 5. Avoid anticoagulation in cavernoma patients due to increased bleeding risk.","references":"1. Rigamonti D, et al. Natural history of cavernous malformations: a prospective study of 75 patients.
