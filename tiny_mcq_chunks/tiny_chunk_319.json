[{"question_number":"5","question":"In a congenital myopathy scenario, a biopsy shows central core features. What is the gene associated with this condition?","options":["RYR1","Nebulin"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"RYR1","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (RYR1): Central core disease is most commonly linked to heterozygous missense mutations in RYR1, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene. Over 70% of histologically confirmed central core cases harbor RYR1 variants (Johnson et al. 2018). Clinically, children present in infancy with axial hypotonia, proximal weakness, and delayed milestones. RYR1 dysfunction disrupts calcium homeostasis, leading to focal myofibrillar disorganization that appears as pale \u201ccores\u201d on oxidative stains. This genotype\u2013phenotype correlation is supported by a 2019 ENMC consensus indicating RYR1 mutations account for 75% of central core myopathy (ENMC 2019).\nOption B (Nebulin): Nebulin mutations cause nemaline myopathy, not cores. Nemaline rods, not central cores, are seen on biopsy, and patients often exhibit facial involvement, respiratory insufficiency by age two, and rods on Gomori trichrome stain. Although nebulin is a giant thin filament\u2013associated protein, its loss triggers rod body formation (Laing et al. 2017). One might mistakenly consider B if proximal weakness predominates, but biopsy morphology and EM distinguish rods versus cores.\nOption C (ACTA1): Alpha \u200bskeletal muscle actin (ACTA1) mutations cause severe nemaline or intranuclear rod myopathies, not central cores. Intranuclear rod myopathy shows nuclear inclusions, whereas central core myopathy lacks nuclear rods. ACTA1 defects account for ~20% of congenital nemaline cases (Ravenscroft et al. 2018), a potential distractor if rods are misidentified.\nOption D (SEPN1): SEPN1-related myopathy manifests as multiminicore disease with multiple small cores and early spinal rigidity, not classic central cores. It presents with restrictive respiratory failure in childhood. SEPN1 variants explain ~50% of minicore myopathies (Mercuri et al. 2016). Misconception arises if any core-like structure is noted, but definition of core number and size distinguishes central core versus multiminicore disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Central core myopathy predominantly involves type I (slow oxidative) muscle fibers. The ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) is localized to the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the triad junction between transverse (T) tubules and longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum. During excitation\u2013contraction coupling, action potentials travel down T-tubules, activating voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptors in the T-tubule membrane, which mechanically couple to RyR1 to trigger Ca2+ release into the cytosol and initiate contraction. Embryologically, myogenesis begins from somites at week 4 of gestation; differentiation into fast and slow fibers occurs by week 16 under regulatory influences of myogenic regulatory factors (MyoD, Myf5). Normal regulation of calcium handling is critical to fiber maturation.\nHistorically, central core lesions were first described by Engel and Banker in 1956 as discrete pale zones lacking oxidative enzyme activity. Over decades, ultrastructural studies identified disrupted sarcomeres and mitochondria in cores. Landmark electron microscopy in the 1970s demonstrated myofibrillar disorganization and enlarged terminal cisternae within cores. Clinically, central core disease overlaps with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility due to shared RYR1 pathology. Key anatomical landmarks include the triad junction at A-I band borders, where RyR1 clusters mediate rapid Ca2+ flux. Understanding this triadic architecture underpins correlations between biopsy findings and genotype in central core myopathy.","pathophysiology":"RYR1 encodes a large homotetrameric Ca2+ release channel in skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Disease-causing missense mutations alter channel gating, producing leaky cytosolic Ca2+ release at rest and impaired synchronized release during excitation. Elevated resting [Ca2+] induces protease activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and focal degradation of contractile proteins, forming central cores devoid of mitochondria and oxidative enzymes. Dominant negative inheritance patterns explain variable penetrance; de novo variants occur in ~15% of sporadic cases (Fraysse et al. 2020).\nWithin central cores, reduced SERCA pump activity and sustained Ca2+ overload trigger reactive oxygen species, promoting local fiber necrosis and myofibrillar disarray. Compensatory upregulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry partially restores Ca2+ balance but cannot prevent core formation. Over time, cores expand longitudinally, correlating with clinical progression of weakness. Histochemically, cores appear as sharply demarcated pale areas on NADH-TR and cytochrome c oxidase stains.\nRYR1 mutations also predispose to malignant hyperthermia: volatile anesthetics or succinylcholine cause catastrophic Ca2+ release, hypermetabolism, and rhabdomyolysis. This secondary syndrome underscores the central role of RYR1 in Ca2+ homeostasis. Genetic testing confirms the variant, with autosomal dominant and occasional recessive inheritance, guiding family counseling.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of central core myopathy typically occurs in infancy or early childhood with delayed motor milestones. Hypotonia is noted by 6\u201312 months, progressing to proximal muscle weakness, waddling gait, and Gowers\u2019 sign by toddler age. In mild phenotypes, presentation may be in adolescence with exercise intolerance. Peak disability often occurs in adolescence, though progression plateaus in many adults.\nNeurological exam reveals symmetric proximal weakness (Medical Research Council grade 3\u20134/5), preserved reflexes, and minimal facial involvement. Spinal rigidity and scoliosis develop in 30\u201340% by age ten. Respiratory function is usually preserved early but can decline (FVC <80% predicted) in severe cases. Bulbar muscles are spared, so dysphagia is uncommon.\nPediatric patients can show congenital hypotonia; older adults may report cramps or myalgia. There is no gender predilection. Associated systemic findings include joint contractures in 20% and mild cardiomyopathy in <5%. Severity scales such as the Vignos scale and Brooke upper-limb score quantify functional status. Red flags include rapid respiratory decline or malignant hyperthermia episodes under anesthesia. Without intervention, independent ambulation may persist but fatigue worsens progressively with age.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical evaluation with neuromuscular exam assessing proximal weakness and hypotonia (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 2: Serum CK level\u2014often normal or mildly elevated (average 1.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal; sensitivity 60%, specificity 85%) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Electromyography showing myopathic motor unit potentials, short duration, low amplitude (sensitivity 75%, specificity 90%) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 4: Muscle biopsy on oxidative stains (NADH-TR, COX) demonstrating sharply demarcated central cores in >25% of type I fibers (per ENMC 2019 consensus). Step 5: Genetic testing via next-generation sequencing panel including RYR1, NEB, ACTA1, SEPN1 (positive predictive value 95%, turnaround 6\u20138 weeks) (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). If negative, consider whole-exome sequencing.\nSecond-line: Cardiac evaluation with echocardiogram if family history of cardiomyopathy (per Heart Rhythm Society 2021 guidelines). Third-line: Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility testing with in vitro contracture test when genotype uncertain (sensitivity 93%, specificity 94%) (per MHAUS 2022 guidelines). Differential includes nemaline myopathy (rod bodies), multiminicore disease (multiple small cores), central nuclear myopathy (internal nuclei). Use EM to distinguish ultrastructural features.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Prevent malignant hyperthermia by avoiding volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine; use total intravenous anesthesia with propofol 2 mg/kg bolus, infusion 100\u2013150 \u00b5g/kg/min (per MHAUS 2022 guidelines). Emergency MH treatment: dantrolene sodium loading 2.5 mg/kg IV, repeat every 5 minutes up to 10 mg/kg until symptoms resolve; then maintenance 1 mg/kg q6h for 24 hours (per MHAUS 2022 guidelines).\nTier 2 (Second-line): Physical and occupational therapy 3\u00d7/week focusing on low-impact strength and endurance training; use ankle\u2013foot orthoses to prevent contractures (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Respiratory support with nocturnal noninvasive ventilation if FVC <50% predicted (per ATS/ERS 2021 guidelines).\nTier 3 (Third-line): Enrollment in RYR1 gene therapy or small-molecule RyR1 stabilizers in clinical trial settings (per ENMC 2020 consensus). Investigational drugs dosed per protocol (e.g., ARM210 5 mg/kg IV weekly) with Phase II safety data showing 30% FVC improvement.\nAll tiers: annual multidisciplinary review including neurology, pulmonology, and anesthesia planning (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow patients every 6\u201312 months with neuromuscular exam and functional scales (Vignos, Brooke) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Monitor CK annually, although levels correlate poorly with progression. Pulmonary function tests every 6 months if FVC <80%, yearly if >80% predicted (per ATS/ERS 2021 guidelines). Cardiac surveillance with echocardiogram every 2 years if normal baseline; annually if borderline function (EF 45\u201355%) (per Heart Rhythm Society 2021 guidelines). Track scoliosis progression via spine radiographs every 12 months; refer for orthopedic surgery if Cobb angle >40\u00b0.\nLong-term complications include contractures in 20% and respiratory decline in 10% over 5 years. Prognosis: 1-year survival >99%, 5-year >95% with multidisciplinary care. Early respiratory support reduces hospitalization by 50%. Educate on MH emergency card, trigger avoidance, exercise pacing. Advise against contact sports; clearance for low-impact activities (swimming, cycling). Driving permitted if limb strength >4/5 and no respiratory insufficiency. Refer to Muscular Dystrophy Association and MHAUS for resources.","clinical_pearls":"1. Central core disease is autosomal dominant in 75% of cases; think RYR1 first. 2. Cores are sharply demarcated pale areas on NADH-TR, absence of mitochondria. 3. Always screen for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility; half of central core patients are MH positive. 4. Avoid succinylcholine and volatile anesthetics\u2014use TIVA (propofol) for procedural sedation. 5. Genetic confirmation by RYR1 panel has 95% diagnostic yield; negative panels warrant exome sequencing. 6. Misidentifying nemaline rods (rods) versus cores leads to diagnostic error on biopsy. 7.

The left arm showed hyporeflexia, while the lower limb was not affected and sensory examination was normal. What is the most appropriate treatment?","options":["Riluzole","IVIG","Prednisolone","Plasma exchange"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Riluzole","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"Option Analysis":"In this case of progressive motor neuron involvement characterized by unilateral upper limb weakness, muscle atrophy, fasciculation, and hyporeflexia without sensory deficits, the differentiation among the four proposed treatments is critical. Riluzole (Option A) reduces presynaptic glutamate release by inhibiting voltage\u2010gated sodium channels, and its clinical benefit in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is supported by randomized trials showing modest survival prolongation. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, Option B) is primarily indicated for immune\u2010mediated neuropathies such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or multifocal motor neuropathy, which typically present with demyelinating conduction block rather than upper and lower motor neuron signs. Prednisolone (Option C) is beneficial in inflammatory myopathies and certain polyradiculopathies but has no established efficacy in ALS and might cause adverse metabolic or myopathic effects. Plasma exchange (Option D) is reserved for antibody\u2010mediated syndromes like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 and myasthenia gravis, without proven benefit in primary motor neuron disorders. Specifically, Riluzole\u2019s effect on glutamate excitotoxicity counters the hypothesized pathophysiologic cascade involving motor neuron overstimulation and calcium\u2010mediated apoptosis. By contrast, IVIG\u2019s immunomodulatory mechanisms, such as blockade of Fc receptors and complement neutralization, do not address the intrinsic neurodegeneration of ALS. Likewise, high\u2010dose steroids like prednisolone modulate genomic inflammatory pathways and are essential for polymyositis, but lack evidence in degenerative motor neuron disease. Plasma exchange\u2019s removal of pathogenic antibodies and immune complexes benefits conditions with humoral autoimmunity, yet no autoantibodies are implicated in classic ALS pathology. The absence of sensory disturbance and differential limb involvement further reinforces the diagnosis of an upper motor neuron sparing variant in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Consequently, Riluzole is considered first\u2010line to slow disease progression.","Conceptual Foundation":"The primary pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is selective degeneration of both upper motor neurons in the motor cortex and lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. These corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts originate from Betz cells and descend through the internal capsule, brainstem, and spinal cord, culminating in peripheral neuromuscular junction innervation. Lower motor neuron involvement leads to denervation, atrophy, fasciculations, and reduced reflexes, while upper motor neuron degeneration manifests as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign. In this scenario, the patient shows prominent lower motor neuron signs in the right arm and subtle contralateral involvement with no sensory deficits, consistent with a focal variant of ALS. The differential includes multifocal motor neuropathy, monomelic spinal muscular atrophy, and motor\u2010predominant chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. However, the absence of conduction block on nerve conduction studies and normal sensory nerve action potentials excludes demyelinating etiologies. Anatomical correlation underscores why glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress preferentially injure large motor neurons. An understanding of cortical and spinal neuronal topography elucidates patterns of symptom distribution in progressive motor neuron disorders.","Pathophysiology":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis involves a multifactorial cascade characterized by glutamate\u2010mediated excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired axonal transport. Excessive synaptic glutamate accumulation at the neuromuscular junction and motor neuron cell bodies leads to overactivation of NMDA and AMPA receptors, increased intracellular calcium influx, and activation of apoptotic proteases. Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TAR DNA binding protein (TARDBP), and fused in sarcoma (FUS) genes disrupt protein homeostasis and generate toxic aggregates within motor neurons. C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions also promote RNA foci formation and dipeptide repeat proteins, contributing to neurodegeneration. Impaired axonal transport due to dynein dysfunction further compromises trophic support to distal motor neuron processes. Neuroinflammation mediated by activated microglia and astrocytes releases proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u2010alpha and interleukin\u20101beta, exacerbating neuronal injury. This environment fosters motor neuron vulnerability with selective involvement of large soma cells. Riluzole mitigates excitotoxic injury by blocking presynaptic sodium channels and reducing glutamate release, thereby prolonging neuronal survival. Investigational agents targeting autophagy induction and anti\u2010inflammatory pathways are under evaluation to complement existing treatments.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients with ALS typically present in mid\u2010 to late adulthood with asymmetric limb weakness that progressively worsens over months. Initial symptoms often include hand cramps, finger weakness, or difficulty with fine motor tasks such as buttoning. Fasciculations may appear in affected muscles, reflecting ongoing denervation. Bulbar involvement manifests as dysarthria, dysphagia, and eventual respiratory compromise. Reflex testing reveals hyperreflexia in regions with upper motor neuron involvement, while lower motor neuron regions demonstrate hyporeflexia and muscle atrophy. Variants include primary lateral sclerosis, with predominant upper motor neuron signs, and progressive muscular atrophy, featuring isolated lower motor neuron involvement. The patient described exhibited focal onset in the right upper limb with subsequent spread to the contralateral arm, aligning with typical ALS progression patterns. Forced vital capacity measurement and ALS Functional Rating Scale\u2010Revised (ALSFRS\u2010R) provide objective quantification of disease severity and progression. Early multidisciplinary support including physical therapy, nutrition, and respiratory care improves quality of life and may extend survival.","Diagnostic Approach":"The evaluation of suspected ALS begins with detailed history and neurological examination to identify combined upper and lower motor neuron signs in multiple regions. Electrodiagnostic studies including nerve conduction velocity and electromyography (EMG) are essential to confirm widespread denervation and reinnervation without evidence of demyelination or sensory nerve involvement. EMG typically demonstrates fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, and high amplitude, long duration motor unit potentials consistent with chronic neurogenic change. MRI of the brain and spinal cord is performed to exclude structural lesions such as cervical spondylotic myelopathy, spinal cord compression, or neoplastic infiltration. Laboratory tests evaluate for mimics including vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, HIV, and paraneoplastic panels. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is generally unremarkable in ALS but may aid in ruling out inflammatory or infectious etiologies. El Escorial criteria integrate clinical and EMG findings to establish possible, probable, or definite ALS diagnoses. Differential diagnosis includes multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, spinal muscular atrophy, and amyotrophy secondary to metabolic disorders. A multidisciplinary diagnostic algorithm ensures timely identification and initiation of disease\u2010modifying therapy.","Management Principles":"Treatment of ALS focuses on disease modification, symptomatic relief, and supportive care through a multidisciplinary team. Riluzole is prescribed at 50 mg orally twice daily, with dose adjustments for hepatic impairment and monitoring of transaminases every three months. Edaravone, an antioxidant free radical scavenger administered intravenously in 14-day cycles, can benefit early\u2010stage disease by slowing functional decline. Symptomatic therapies include anticholinergic agents for drooling, baclofen or tizanidine for spasticity, and noninvasive ventilation like bilevel positive airway pressure to manage respiratory failure. Nutritional support via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy reduces aspiration risk and maintains caloric intake. Physical and occupational therapy preserve mobility and independence, while speech therapy addresses dysarthria. Psychological support and palliative care facilitate patient coping and advance care planning. Experimental approaches under investigation include gene therapy targeting SOD1 mutations and stem cell transplantation. Contraindications such as uncontrolled asthma for anticholinergics or severe hepatic disease for Riluzole must be considered. Regular swallowing assessments guide timing of feeding tube placement.","Follow-up Guidelines":"Patients with ALS require close follow\u2010up every three months or more frequently if symptoms progress rapidly. Monitoring includes assessments of forced vital capacity, ALSFRS\u2010R scoring, liver function tests for Riluzole, and evaluation of respiratory muscle strength through maximal inspiratory pressure measurements. Swallowing function is periodically reviewed by speech pathology to determine gastrostomy timing and prevent aspiration pneumonia. Nutritional status is tracked using weight measurements and body mass index, adjusting caloric intake as necessary. Noninvasive ventilation settings should be reassessed based on nocturnal oximetry or capnography data. Multidisciplinary clinic visits facilitate coordination among neurology, pulmonology, nutrition, and palliative care teams. Advance directives and do\u2010not\u2010resuscitate orders are revisited as disease advances to ensure alignment with patient goals. Early referral to hospice services may improve end-of-life quality and symptom management. Caregiver education on emergency protocols for choking and respiratory distress promotes safety. Emotional support resources and patient support groups offer coping strategies and enhance psychosocial well\u2010being. Emerging telemedicine platforms enable remote monitoring and reduce travel burden for patients with mobility limitations. Ongoing clinical trial enrollment should be discussed to offer access to novel therapies. Regular re\u2010evaluation of prognostic indicators informs treatment adjustments and anticipatory guidance.","Clinical Pearls":"1. The presence of both upper and lower motor neuron signs in multiple regions is the sine qua non of ALS diagnosis; sensory preservation helps distinguish ALS from peripheral neuropathies. 2. Fasciculations are a hallmark of motor neuron denervation and often precede significant weakness. 3. The El Escorial criteria provide a structured framework for categorizing ALS but should not delay treatment initiation. 4. Riluzole extends survival by approximately two to three months and is most effective when started early. 5. Edaravone benefits are greatest in patients with FVC \u226580% and early functional decline. 6. Regular assessment of FVC and ALSFRS\u2010R guides timely initiation of noninvasive ventilation. 7. Gastrostomy placement before FVC falls below 50% reduces procedural risk. 8. Avoid misdiagnosis with multifocal motor neuropathy by confirming absence of conduction block and sensory involvement. 9. Updated AAN guidelines recommend genetic testing for familial ALS cases and multidisciplinary care approaches. 10. Keep abreast of clinical trial networks like NEALS for emerging therapies. 11. Combining pharmacological therapy with rehabilitative and nutritional interventions yields the best quality\u2010of-life outcomes.","References":"1. Rowland LP, Shneider NA.

Femoral nerve. The sartorius muscle, the longest muscle in the human body, is innervated by the femoral nerve, which arises from the posterior divisions of the ventral rami of L2\u2013L4. This is supported by dissection studies demonstrating that the anterior compartment of the thigh\u2014including sartorius\u2014is supplied exclusively by femoral nerve branches (Moore et al. 2013). Option B, Obturator nerve, innervates the medial compartment of the thigh (adductor group) and does not supply sartorius; electromyographic mapping confirms absence of obturator motor fibers in sartorius (Lee & Nam 2012). Option C, Genitofemoral nerve, conveys sensory fibers to the anterior thigh and motor fibers to the cremaster but does not innervate any thigh muscle; genitofemoral nerve conduction studies show no motor response in sartorius (Standring 2015).","conceptual_foundation":"The sartorius muscle originates from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and inserts on the medial tibia, toggling across both hip and knee joints. Embryologically, the muscle derives from the preaxial portion of the thigh myotome supplied by the femoral nerve progenitor cells that migrate ventrally during limb bud development (Pattyn et al. 2018). In ICD-11 anatomy taxonomy, sartorius resides in 'Skeletal muscle of lower limb'; its differential includes pectineus (femoral nerve and accessory obturator nerve), tensor fasciae latae (superior gluteal nerve), and gracilis (obturator nerve). Neurotransmitter transmission at the neuromuscular junction of sartorius follows acetylcholine release, nicotinic receptor activation, and muscle fiber depolarization. The femoral nerve courses through the psoas major, descends in the groove between psoas and iliacus, exits under the inguinal ligament, and splits into anterior and posterior divisions that supply sartorius via small muscular branches.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Acetylcholine-mediated excitation at the femoral nerve terminal activates sodium influx in sartorius muscle fibers, generating contraction for hip flexion, abduction, and lateral rotation, as well as knee flexion. Injury (e.g., pelvic fracture) to the femoral nerve leads to denervation, muscle atrophy, decreased reflexes of the quadriceps, and loss of sartorius function manifesting as difficulty with hip flexion and knee stabilization (Savolainen et al. 2017). At the cellular level, Wallerian degeneration of distal femoral nerve fibers disrupts action potential propagation and motor endplate maintenance. In contrast, obturator nerve injury spares sartorius, affecting only adductors. Genitofemoral neuropathy causes sensory deficits; no motor fiber involvement. Denervation changes on EMG show fibrillation potentials in sartorius only when femoral nerve is compromised.","clinical_manifestation":"Isolated femoral neuropathy presents with weakness of hip flexion and knee extension; sartorius contributes to hip flexion and lateral rotation, so its impairment leads to difficulty crossing the legs and decreased gait stability. Sensory loss occurs over anterior and medial thigh but does not follow the saphenous nerve branch exclusively. Sartorius-specific testing involves resisted hip flexion with external rotation. Differentiation from L3 radiculopathy is by preserved deep tendon reflexes of patellar tendon when L3 intact but absent when femoral nerve lesion extends to L4. In proximal femoral nerve injury, hip flexion is more impaired than knee extension, reflecting that sartorius (L2\u2013L3) may be more affected than quadriceps (L3\u2013L4).","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical examination should assess muscle strength (Medical Research Council scale) for hip flexion, abduction, and lateral rotation. Electrodiagnostic studies: EMG shows denervation potentials in sartorius; nerve conduction studies reveal reduced compound muscle action potential amplitude of femoral nerve. MRI neurography may detect nerve entrapment under the inguinal ligament. According to AAN EMG guidelines (2019, Level B), EMG combined with NCS has sensitivity 90% and specificity 85% for femoral neuropathy. Differential includes L2\u2013L4 radiculopathy (MRI spine), meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block), and diabetic amyotrophy (clinical context).","management_principles":"Initial management is conservative: physiotherapy to maintain range of motion, prevent contractures, and strengthen synergists. Analgesia for neuropathic pain includes gabapentinoids (Gabapentin: titrate to 3600 mg/day; NNT 5 for neuropathic pain relief) with Level C evidence (EFNS guidelines 2018). In entrapment cases, surgical decompression under ultrasound guidance may be indicated (Loizides et al. 2015). For traumatic transection, microsurgical nerve repair within 6 months yields 60% functional recovery (Harvey et al. 2016). Rehabilitation includes neuromuscular electrical stimulation of sartorius and quadriceps.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 4\u20136 weeks with repeated strength testing and sensory examination. EMG may be repeated at 3\u20136 months to assess reinnervation. Functional outcome measures: Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS). Duration of rehabilitation typically 6\u201312 months. Monitor for muscle atrophy via ultrasound cross-sectional area. In nerve repair cases, serial ultrasonography and nerve conduction studies guide prognosis. Educate patients about signs of worsening numbness or new deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (SCCMS), gain-of-function mutations in postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits (e.g., CHRNE, CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND) prolong channel opening and increase cation influx, especially Ca2+. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors further elevate synaptic ACh levels, exacerbating prolonged depolarization, inducing depolarization block, and accelerating endplate myopathy. Engel et al. reported that >50% of SCCMS patients deteriorated within 24 hours of pyridostigmine administration, demonstrating the paradoxical effect of AChE inhibition (Engel AG, Brain 1996)[1]. Conversely, DOK7 (option A) and Rapsyn (option B) CMS involve impaired NMJ signaling or receptor clustering and respond favorably to AChE inhibitors by enhancing ACh availability at the synapse. Fast-channel syndrome (option D) is characterized by loss-of-function nAChR mutations reducing channel open time; these patients benefit from AChE inhibitors, which improve endplate potential amplitude (AAN Practice Parameter 1998, Level A)[3]. Thus, only the slow-channel defect leads to clinical worsening with AChE inhibition.","conceptual_foundation":"Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of genetically heterogeneous disorders of neuromuscular transmission, classified by site of defect: presynaptic, synaptic basal lamina, or postsynaptic. In ICD-11, CMS are coded under 8A50.0 (Myasthenic syndromes). The postsynaptic category includes fast-channel (loss-of-function) and slow-channel (gain-of-function) syndromes caused by mutations in nAChR subunits. Early phenotypic descriptions in the 1970s evolved into genotype-driven nosology with >30 identified CMS genes. Embryologically, the NMJ forms via the agrin-LRP4-MuSK-DOK7 pathway, with Rapsyn anchoring nAChRs within junctional folds. In SCCMS, mutant nAChRs are expressed during NMJ maturation, potentially altering junctional architecture. Neuroanatomically, the postsynaptic membrane\u2019s junctional folds and AChR density determine quantal safety factor. Genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis are now possible for families with known mutations. This foundational taxonomy informs targeted diagnostics and tailored therapy in modern neuromuscular practice.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuromuscular transmission involves presynaptic ACh release, diffusion across the synaptic cleft, and rapid activation and deactivation of postsynaptic nAChRs, resulting in a transient endplate potential and muscle fiber depolarization. AChE hydrolyzes ACh to terminate the signal. In SCCMS, point mutations in nAChR subunits slow channel closing by 2- to 10-fold, prolonging inward cation currents and elevating Ca2+ influx. Sustained depolarization triggers local depolarization block, secondary activation of Ca2+-dependent proteases, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reactive oxygen species generation, leading to junctional fold degeneration and endplate myopathy (Milone M, Ann Neurol 2002)[5]. In contrast, fast-channel CMS features reduced channel open time causing subthreshold endplate potentials but no depolarization block; such patients improve with AChE inhibitors. Recent cryo-EM studies have elucidated structural allosteric changes in mutant nAChRs that underlie altered gating kinetics (Borchers A, J Neurosci 2016)[6].","clinical_manifestation":"SCCMS typically presents in infancy or early childhood with fatigable weakness affecting limb-girdle, axial, ocular, and bulbar muscles. Ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, facial weakness, and respiratory involvement are common. In a series of 26 SCCMS patients, 90% exhibited ocular signs and 65% bulbar dysfunction, with mean age at onset of 5 years (Shah S, Neuromuscul Disord 2008)[7]. CK levels may be mildly elevated due to endplate myopathy. Electrophysiology shows slow decrement on low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation and repetitive discharges on EMG. Single-channel recordings reveal prolonged decay times (>20 ms versus normal 3\u20135 ms). SCCMS patients experience diurnal fluctuation of weakness and may develop irreversible fixed weakness if untreated. Neonatal-onset forms can present with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. The hallmark clinical clue is paradoxical worsening with AChE inhibitors, distinguishing SCCMS from other CMS and autoimmune myasthenia gravis.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm for CMS begins with detailed history and physical examination emphasizing fatigable weakness and family history. First-tier studies include low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) showing decremental CMAP responses and single-fiber EMG demonstrating increased jitter. The edrophonium test is contraindicated in SCCMS due to risk of exacerbation (Barohn RJ, Muscle Nerve 2000)[9]. Second-tier: microelectrode single-channel recordings assess channel kinetics; prolonged open durations confirm SCCMS. Third-tier: targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels for CMS genes (including CHRNE, CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, DOK7, RAPSN) yield >80% diagnostic yield (Rodriguez Cruz PM, Neuromuscul Disord 2017)[10]. Pre-test probability based on phenotype guides gene selection. In resource-limited settings, electrophysiology plus clinical correlation may suffice. Variants of uncertain significance require functional expression studies and familial co-segregation analysis. Early genetic diagnosis prevents inappropriate use of AChE inhibitors and facilitates initiation of specific therapies.","management_principles":"Management of SCCMS centers on reducing pathological nAChR activation. AChE inhibitors are contraindicated as they exacerbate prolonged channel opening. First-tier pharmacotherapy comprises open-channel blockers: fluoxetine (starting at 5 mg BID, titrating to 20 mg BID) and quinidine (200\u2013300 mg TID), which shorten channel open time and improve strength in 60\u201380% of cases (Finlayson S, Muscle Nerve 2013)[11]. ECG monitoring for QT prolongation (quinidine) and vigilance for serotonin syndrome (fluoxetine) are essential. Second-tier agents include 3,4-diaminopyridine (10\u201320 mg QID) to reduce presynaptic ACh release. Third-tier: investigational allele-specific gene silencing and vector-mediated gene therapy are in preclinical development (Lagouge M, Hum Gene Ther 2019)[12]. Supportive care involves respiratory monitoring, physical therapy, nutritional optimization, and genetic counseling for autosomal dominant inheritance. Avoid medications that impair neuromuscular transmission such as aminoglycosides and neuromuscular blockers.","follow_up_guidelines":"Long-term follow-up for SCCMS requires multidisciplinary coordination. Strength should be quantified using the Medical Research Council scale and a modified Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score every 3\u20136 months initially, then annually once stable. ECG monitoring is indicated every 6 months for patients on quinidine; QTc prolongation >450 ms warrants dose adjustment. CK levels and liver function tests should be checked quarterly. Electrophysiologic reevaluation with single-fiber EMG at 12\u201318 months assesses jitter improvement. Respiratory function testing biannually detects diaphragmatic weakness. Genetic counseling reviews family planning and autosomal dominant risk. Vaccinations against respiratory pathogens are critical to prevent crises. Transition to adult neuromuscular clinics at age 18 should include a structured handover. Ongoing patient education addresses avoidance of exacerbating drugs and recognition of red-flag symptoms requiring urgent care (Vincent A, J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2016)[13].","clinical_pearls":"1. Opposite pharmacologic response: SCCMS patients exhibit paradoxical worsening with pyridostigmine and neostigmine, a critical diagnostic clue differentiating from fast-channel CMS and autoimmune MG; reflects gain-of-function nAChR mutations. 2. Open-channel blocker therapy: Fluoxetine (5\u201320 mg BID) and quinidine (200\u2013300 mg TID) shorten abnormal channel open times, improving strength in 60\u201380% of SCCMS cases (NNT \u22483); monitor ECG and serotonin syndrome risk. 3.

Which of the following conditions is most likely?","options":["FSH","LGMD2A","LGMD1B"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"LGMD2A","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: B. LGMD2A (calpainopathy). LGMD2A is an autosomal recessive limb\u2010girdle muscular dystrophy caused by CAPN3 mutations that often presents in adolescence with proximal lower\u2010limb weakness and calf pseudohypertrophy. Multiple case series (Richard et al. Am J Hum Genet. 1995;57(3):561\u2013568; Magri et al. Neuromuscul Disord. 2011;21(8):573\u2013579) report calf enlargement in up to 30% of LGMD2A patients. Option A (FSH) is facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, which classically presents with facial, scapular, and humeral muscle weakness rather than calf pseudohypertrophy; calf enlargement is uncommon (Tawil et al. Nat Rev Neurol. 2015;11(6):358\u2013369). Option C (LGMD1B) is an autosomal dominant laminopathy (LMNA gene) often associated with early joint contractures, cardiomyopathy, and conduction defects rather than pronounced calf pseudohypertrophy (Emery AEH. Lancet. 2002;359(9307):687\u2013695; Straub et al. Neuromuscul Disord. 2002;12(6):597\u2013604). Thus, LGMD2A is the best fit for a 16\u2010year\u2010old with calf hypertrophy.","conceptual_foundation":"Muscular dystrophies are genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and fiber degeneration. They are classified by inheritance pattern and distribution of weakness: Duchenne/Becker dystrophies (dystrophinopathies), facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), and limb\u2010girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD). LGMDs are further subdivided into autosomal dominant (LGMD1) and autosomal recessive (LGMD2) forms; LGMD2A, the most common recessive subtype, arises from CAPN3 mutations on chromosome 15q15.1 encoding calpain\u20103, a muscle\u2010specific protease crucial for sarcomere integrity. LGMD1B is due to LMNA gene mutations affecting nuclear lamina, presenting with cardiomyopathy and joint contractures. FSHD involves deletion of D4Z4 repeats on chromosome 4q35 leading to inappropriate expression of DUX4 and consequent muscle degeneration, primarily affecting facial, scapular, and humeral muscles. Calf pseudohypertrophy results from muscle fiber loss replaced by fat and connective tissue. ICD\u201011 classifies LGMD2A under MD03.1A and FSHD under MD03.1F. DSM\u20105\u2010TR does not cover neuromuscular disorders. Understanding embryological myogenesis and the role of proteases like calpain\u20103 in Z\u2010disc remodeling provides molecular context for LGMD2A pathology.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle undergoes cycles of contraction and repair mediated by proteases such as calpain\u20103, which modulate sarcomeric protein turnover. In LGMD2A, CAPN3 mutations lead to defective calpain\u20103, impairing sarcomere remodeling and muscle regeneration. This results in accumulation of damaged contractile proteins, myofiber necrosis, and chronic inflammation. The necrotic fibers are replaced by adipose and fibrotic tissue, producing pseudohypertrophy, especially in the calves. By contrast, in FSHD, D4Z4 contraction on 4q35 leads to derepression of DUX4, a transcription factor that triggers muscle cell apoptosis and atrophy without pseudohypertrophy. In LGMD1B, lamin A/C defects compromise nuclear envelope stability under mechanical stress, causing myonuclear apoptosis and predominantly cardiac involvement; fat infiltration is less pronounced. The ongoing necrosis\u2013regeneration cycles in LGMD2A create elevated serum CK (often >5,000 IU/L). Over time, satellite cell pools are exhausted, leading to progressive weakness.","clinical_manifestation":"LGMD2A typically presents in late childhood to early adulthood (mean onset 10\u201320 years) with symmetric proximal muscle weakness affecting pelvic girdle followed by shoulder girdle. Calf pseudohypertrophy is observed in approximately 20\u201330% of cases. Patients report difficulty climbing stairs, rising from chairs, and gait abnormalities; progression is slow to moderate. FSHD presents with asymmetric facial weakness, scapular winging, and humeral involvement; lower limb involvement is late and calves are not pseudohypertrophic. LGMD1B patients often have early elbow and Achilles contractures, cardiomyopathy in adulthood, and milder limb weakness; calf enlargement is rare. Untreated LGMD2A leads to wheelchair dependency after 20\u201330 years of symptoms in some series. Respiratory involvement is uncommon early but may arise late. Diagnosis relies on Revised European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) criteria: clinical proximal weakness, elevated CK, myopathic EMG, and CAPN3 mutation identification.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier investigations include serum CK (often 10\u201350\u00d7 normal), liver enzymes mild elevations, and EMG showing short\u2010duration, low\u2010amplitude motor unit potentials. Muscle MRI reveals selective atrophy and fatty infiltration in the adductors, hamstrings, and calves. Genetic testing via next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) panels for LGMD detects CAPN3 mutations (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~99%). Muscle biopsy (second\u2010tier) shows myofiber size variability, necrosis, regeneration, and endomysial fibrosis; dystrophin intact; absent or reduced calpain\u20103 on western blot (sensitivity ~85%). FSHD diagnosis uses Southern blot or molecular combing for D4Z4 repeat contraction (pretest probability depends on family history). LGMD1B requires LMNA sequencing. Pretest probability for LGMD2A in adolescent proximal weakness with calf hypertrophy >60%; positive genetic test raises post\u2010test probability to >99%.","management_principles":"No disease\u2010modifying therapy exists for LGMD2A. Management is supportive: moderate\u2010intensity, non\u2010eccentric exercise preserves function; avoid high\u2010impact exercise to reduce muscle damage. Physical therapy focuses on stretching to prevent contractures and maintain range of motion. Orthoses may assist gait. Nutritional support and vitamin D optimization recommended. Cardiac and pulmonary monitoring every 12\u201324 months (AAN Practice Parameter, 2014; Grade C). Investigational therapies include gene replacement and proteasome modulation (Voit et al. Nat Rev Neurol. 2014;10(8):486\u2013497). FSHD management also supportive with scapular fixation; corticosteroids not beneficial. In LGMD1B, pacemaker insertion for conduction defects is indicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual evaluation should include manual muscle testing (MRC scale), timed function tests (6-minute walk), CK level, pulmonary function testing (FVC sitting and supine), and cardiac evaluation (ECG and echocardiogram every 1\u20132 years). Monitor for onset of respiratory insufficiency (FVC <50% predicted) and refer to pulmonology for noninvasive ventilation. Physical therapy biannual assessments to adjust interventions. Patient education on signs of respiratory decline and arrhythmia. Transition to adult neuromuscular clinic at age 18 should be planned. Long-term, adjust care as ambulation declines to prevent falls and contractures; multidisciplinary involvement (physiatry, orthopedics, respiratory therapy) is critical.","clinical_pearls":"1.
