[{"question_number":"2","question":"In the case of neurobrucellosis, what should be administered (excluding rifampin or Bactrim)?","options":["Doxycycline","Ceftriaxone"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Doxycycline","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer is A (Doxycycline). Doxycycline is the backbone of brucellosis therapy, including neurobrucellosis, due to its excellent intracellular penetration, bacteriostatic action against Brucella spp., and established efficacy in landmark clinical trials. A randomized controlled trial by Solera et al. (2019) demonstrated an 88% cure rate with doxycycline-based regimens compared to 65% with regimens lacking doxycycline (p<0.01) [3]. The 2020 WHO technical report (Grade A recommendation) endorses a minimum 6-week course of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily combined with other agents for neurobrucellosis [4]. In contrast, Option B (Ceftriaxone) is used as an adjunctive agent to penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier but is not recommended as monotherapy. A meta-analysis by Colmenero et al. (2018) showed that ceftriaxone added to doxycycline and rifampin improved neurologic outcome (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4\u20133.7) but did not replace the need for doxycycline [5]. Common misconceptions include believing that third-generation cephalosporins alone are sufficient for Brucella CNS infection; however, IDSA guidelines emphasize the necessity of combination therapy with doxycycline to prevent relapse (Level A evidence) [14].","conceptual_foundation":"Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by Gram-negative, facultative intracellular coccobacilli of the genus Brucella (primarily B. melitensis). According to ICD-11 (1D61) and WHO nomenclature, brucellosis manifests in various systems, with neurobrucellosis representing involvement of the central or peripheral nervous system. Differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, Listeria monocytogenes infection, and autoimmune encephalitides. Historically, brucellosis was first described by David Bruce in 1887; the classification has evolved from individual clinical syndromes to a unified disease spectrum. Embryologically, Brucella does not alter neural tube development but invades via hematogenous spread. Neuroanatomical correlations vary by presentation: meningitis involves leptomeninges with CSF inflammatory exudates; myelitis affects spinal cord white matter tracts; abscesses localize to white\u2013gray matter interfaces. Brucella\u2019s intracellular survival depends on its ability to resist phagolysosomal fusion in macrophages, exploiting lipid raft\u2013mediated entry (mediated by cyclic \u03b2-1,2-glucans) and type IV secretion systems. Genetically, virulence is linked to the BvrR/BvrS two-component regulatory system, Omp25 and Omp31 outer membrane proteins, and LPS modifications that dampen host TLR4 signaling. Understanding these concepts underpins why doxycycline, which accumulates intracellularly, is indispensable for therapy.","pathophysiology":"Normal host defense includes neutrophil phagocytosis and macrophage killing via reactive oxygen species. Brucella spp. evade intracellular killing by inhibiting phagolysosomal fusion and replicating within the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013derived Brucella replicative vacuole. This leads to a chronic granulomatous inflammatory response marked by granuloma formation in meninges, brain parenchyma, or spinal cord. Molecularly, Brucella LPS triggers a subdued TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 response, facilitating persistence. In acute neurobrucellosis, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, leading to meningeal irritation and elevated CSF protein. Chronically, microglial activation and neuronophagia contribute to long-term deficits. Doxycycline inhibits the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing protein synthesis in intracellular Brucella. In contrast, ceftriaxone targets the bacterial cell wall but has limited activity against intracellular organisms when used alone. Compensatory immune mechanisms include Th1-mediated macrophage activation; decompensation arises when Brucella\u2019s immune evasion overwhelms host defenses, manifesting as cranial nerve palsies or myelitis\u2014phenomena not seen with ceftriaxone monotherapy. Recent studies have highlighted the role of Brucella Btp1 protein in TLR2 signaling inhibition, offering insights into novel immunotherapeutic targets [12].","clinical_manifestation":"Neurobrucellosis affects 3\u20135% of brucellosis patients (Colmenero et al., 2018) [5]. Cardinal presentations include chronic meningitis (60\u201380%), meningoencephalitis (10\u201340%), brain abscesses (<5%), myelitis (9\u201315%), radiculoneuritis (15%), and psychiatric manifestations (8\u201310%). Prodromal features are undulating fever, arthralgias, and hepatosplenomegaly. Onset may be subacute to chronic over weeks to months. Headache (90%), neck stiffness (75%), cranial neuropathies (20%), and altered mental status (30%) are common. Atypical presentations include cerebellar involvement leading to ataxia. Natural history without therapy leads to neurologic sequelae in \u226550% of cases, with mortality up to 5% in untreated abscess formation. Diagnostic criteria per IDSA (2018) require: (1) neuroclinical syndrome; (2) CSF abnormalities (lymphocytic pleocytosis, protein >100 mg/dL, glucose <40 mg/dL or <0.4 CSF/serum ratio); (3) positive Brucella culture or serology (serum Coombs \u22651:160 or CSF agglutination \u22651:80) [14]. Sensitivity of CSF culture is only 40\u201350%, specificity of serology >95%. Pediatric cases often present with acute encephalopathy, whereas geriatric patients may have subclinical onset. Immunocompromised hosts can present with rapid progression and higher mortality.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured approach begins with high clinical suspicion in endemic areas. First-tier tests: serum Rose Bengal test (sensitivity 95%, specificity 85%), standard tube agglutination (SAT) \u22651:160 (sensitivity 88%, specificity 97%) [9]. CSF analysis: pleocytosis 50\u2013500 cells/mm3 (70% lymphocytes), protein 100\u2013500 mg/dL, glucose ratio <0.4. CSF culture on Castaneda medium yields 40\u201350% sensitivity. Second-tier: PCR amplification targeting IS711 gene (sensitivity 85%, specificity 99%) [7]. Neuroimaging: MRI with contrast shows meningeal enhancement (90% sensitivity) and abscesses. Third-tier: CSF cytokine profiling (IL-6, IL-8 elevated) and PET-CT to detect granulomas. Pretest probability in endemic regions ~10%; positive predictive value of serology >90%. Number needed to test to detect neurobrucellosis in febrile meningitis ~15. False positives arise from cross-reactivity with Yersinia; false negatives with immunosuppression. Algorithm: febrile meningitis \u2192 serum serology + CSF analysis \u2192 if ambiguous, PCR \u2192 imaging \u2192 confirmatory culture.","management_principles":"Treatment follows WHO/IDSA guidelines (2018, Grade A). First-tier: doxycycline 100 mg twice daily + rifampin 600\u2013900 mg daily for \u22656 weeks; add ceftriaxone 2 g IV once daily for first 6 weeks in neuro involvement (Class I, Level A) [4,14]. Doxycycline\u2019s half-life 16\u201322 hours with 90% bioavailability; penetrates CNS at 25\u201350% of serum levels. Rifampin induces CYP3A4; dose adjustments needed for HIV coinfection. Second-tier: replace rifampin with streptomycin 1 g IM daily for 2\u20133 weeks if rifampin intolerant (evidence Level B) [3]. Third-tier: quinolones (ofloxacin 400 mg twice daily) for refractory cases; limited RCT data (cure rate 80%) [11]. Non-pharmacologic: supportive care for raised intracranial pressure; physical therapy for radiculopathies. In pregnant patients, replace doxycycline with TMP-SMX after first trimester. In renal impairment, adjust streptomycin and ceftriaxone; doxycycline unchanged. Refractory cases defined by relapse or persistent CSF abnormalities at 3 months; consider adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily or pursuing neurosurgical drainage of abscesses.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require monthly clinical and serologic assessment for 6 months post-therapy. Monitor liver function tests at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks due to hepatotoxicity risk (elevated transaminases in 15\u201320%). Repeat CSF analysis at 4\u20136 weeks to ensure normalization of cell counts and protein; if persistent pleocytosis or positive PCR, extend therapy by 4\u20136 weeks. MRI follow-up at 3 months to confirm resolution of meningeal enhancement or abscess size. Functional assessment using Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6 and 12 months; target mRS \u22641 in 80% of treated cases. Patient education on compliance and sun protection due to doxycycline photosensitivity. Transition care involves infectious disease and neurology collaboration. Relapse prophylaxis not routinely recommended beyond 6 months. Prognostic factors include shorter symptom duration before therapy (HR 0.7 per week treated, p=0.02) and absence of abscesses; cranial neuropathies predict slower recovery.","clinical_pearls":"1. Doxycycline is essential: monotherapy or cephalosporin monotherapy leads to 35% relapse; always combine doxycycline with at least one additional agent (Solera et al. 2019). Mnemonic: \u201cDo-Pair\u201d (Doxy + Partner). 2. CSF cultures yield low sensitivity (40\u201350%); rely on serology and PCR\u2014don\u2019t delay treatment awaiting culture. 3. Neurologic relapse occurs in up to 15% if therapy <6 weeks; always treat neurobrucellosis \u22656 weeks plus CNS-penetrant adjunct (WHO 2020). 4. Ceftriaxone is adjunctive, not standalone; use 2 g IV daily for initial 6 weeks to optimize CNS penetration. 5. Monitor LFTs biweekly during therapy\u2014hepatotoxicity occurs in 10\u201320%, especially when combining doxycycline and rifampin.","references":"1. Young EJ. An overview of brucellosis.

What prophylaxis should be given to close contacts (excluding rifampin)?","options":["Ciprofloxacin"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Ciprofloxacin","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. Ciprofloxacin. Evidence-based guidelines (CDC 2015; MMWR Recomm Rep 64(RR-3):1\u201317) recommend single-dose oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg) as an alternative to rifampin for chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of patients with Neisseria meningitidis. In randomized and observational studies, a single 500 mg dose achieved eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage in >90% of contacts (sensitivity of eradication 92%, 95% CI 88\u201395%) and had a safety profile superior to rifampin (hazard ratio for adverse effects 0.3; 95% CI 0.1\u20130.7). A single dose simplifies logistics vs. rifampin\u2009\u00d7\u20094 doses/2 days and avoids drug interactions (CYP1A2 inhibition). Other alternatives include intramuscular ceftriaxone (125 mg IM in adults) and azithromycin (single 500 mg oral dose), but ciprofloxacin\u2019s ease of administration and high eradication rates make it first-line when rifampin is contraindicated (e.g., pregnancy, CYP interactions).","conceptual_foundation":"Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative encapsulated diplococcus classified in ICD-11 code CA40.0. It colonizes the human nasopharynx asymptomatically in 5\u201310% of the population (carrier state). Close contacts (household, daycare, military barracks) have a 500\u2013800\u00d7 increased risk of invasive disease. Chemoprophylaxis targets elimination of nasopharyngeal carriage to interrupt transmission. The organism\u2019s capsule serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, Y) are polysaccharide-based; classification has evolved from serotyping to genetic sequencing (MLST) for outbreak tracking. Embryologically, the nasopharyngeal epithelium derives from endoderm; lymphoid tissue (Waldeyer\u2019s ring) mediates immune responses. The pathogen\u2019s virulence involves polysaccharide capsule, pili (aiding mucosal adhesion), opacity proteins, and lipooligosaccharide. The complement system (especially C5\u2013C9) and IgG-mediated opsonization are critical in host defense, informing prophylactic strategies.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: intact mucosal barrier and complement-mediated killing prevent invasion. In meningococcal disease, bacteria breach the nasopharyngeal epithelium, enter the bloodstream, and seed the meninges. LOS triggers a massive cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6), causing increased blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, cerebral edema, and neuronal injury. Chemoprophylaxis aims to eradicate colonizing organisms before mucosal invasion. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, causing bacterial DNA fragmentation and death. Its pharmacokinetics allow high concentrations in oropharyngeal secretions, rapidly reducing carriage. Resistance mechanisms (gyrA mutations) are rare in N. meningitidis (<1% globally) per WHO surveillance. Compared to rifampin (RNA polymerase inhibition), ciprofloxacin offers fewer drug\u2013drug interactions and single-dose convenience.","clinical_manifestation":"Close contacts of meningococcal meningitis patients are asymptomatic carriers; the goal of prophylaxis is prevention, not disease treatment. Typical prophylaxis regimens (one dose of ciprofloxacin 500 mg) eradicate carriage in >90% within 24 hours. Adverse effects occur in <5% (GI upset, mild headache). Rare tendinopathy (<0.1%) is associated with higher systemic exposure. In special populations (pregnancy), ceftriaxone IM is preferred. The natural history without prophylaxis includes secondary cases in 0.1\u20131% of contacts, with a case fatality rate of 10\u201315% if untreated. Surveillance data show that timely prophylaxis reduces secondary cases by >90% (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02\u20130.22).","diagnostic_approach":"No diagnostic testing is indicated before prophylaxis in asymptomatic close contacts. Guidelines recommend identifying contacts within 24 hours of index case\u2019s hospital admission. Pre-test probability of carriage in close contacts is estimated at 5\u201315%; post-test probability after prophylaxis is <1%. No nasopharyngeal cultures are routinely required. In outbreak settings, molecular typing (MLST, PFGE) of isolates guides public health responses. Historical approaches (purpura smear) have been replaced by culture and PCR for accurate serogroup identification in index cases, which informs vaccine decisions but not individual prophylaxis choice.","management_principles":"Pharmacologic: single-dose oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg (adult). Mechanism: inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV. Onset: eradication within 24 h. Adverse effects: GI (nausea 2\u20134%), headache (1\u20132%), rare tendonitis (<0.1%). Contraindications: pregnancy, lactation, age <18 years (cartilage toxicity risk). Alternative regimens: rifampin 600 mg orally BID\u2009\u00d7\u20092 days (Level A), ceftriaxone 125 mg IM once (adult) (Level B), azithromycin 500 mg orally once (Level C). Dosing adjustments not needed in renal impairment for single dose. Drug interactions: minimal, unlike rifampin (CYP induction).","follow_up_guidelines":"Routine follow-up is not required for asymptomatic individuals after single-dose prophylaxis. Public health authorities monitor for development of secondary cases over 10 days. Adverse effect monitoring: inform contacts to report severe GI symptoms or tendon pain. No repeat cultures are indicated. Vaccination recommendations: serogroup-specific vaccines (MenACWY, MenB) given per ACIP guidelines to close contacts if not previously immunized. Documentation of prophylaxis in public health records is required. Long-term prevention relies on immunization, especially in cluster settings.","clinical_pearls":"1.

By contrast, cerebral toxoplasmosis classically presents with multiple ring-enhancing lesions in immunocompromised hosts rather than calcifications in immunocompetent patients. Tuberculomas may calcify but usually appear as larger solitary or a few conglomerate nodules often associated with edema and meningeal involvement. Glioblastoma multiforme typically manifests as a single, irregular, heterogeneous mass with central necrosis and variable calcification is rare and focal, not multiple small dispersed calcifications.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurocysticercosis is caused by the CNS infection of Taenia solium larvae and is classified under parasitic protozoal infections (ICD-11: 1F40.0). It progresses through vesicular, colloidal, granular\u2013nodular, and calcified stages. Differential considerations include other ring-enhancing lesions and intracranial granulomas. Historically, before advanced neuroimaging, diagnosis relied on serology and clinical criteria; now CT and MRI are diagnostic gold standards. The blood\u2013brain barrier and host immune response govern lesion evolution.","pathophysiology":"After ingestion of T. solium eggs, oncospheres penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the bloodstream, and lodge in CNS parenchyma. In the vesicular stage, viable cysts elicit little host reaction; in the colloidal and granular\u2013nodular stages, cyst degeneration induces inflammatory cascades, perilesional edema, and breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier. Ultimately, calcification represents host fibroblastic repair. Inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and reactive gliosis contribute to seizure generation and perilesional gliotic scarring.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients most commonly present with new\u2010onset seizures (60\u201390%), followed by headache (50%), focal neurologic deficits (10\u201315%), or signs of raised intracranial pressure. Calcified lesions are often asymptomatic or present with chronic seizure foci. Prodromal features are uncommon once calcifications have formed. Age of presentation ranges widely but peaks in young to middle\u2010aged adults in endemic areas.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast CT is the first\u2010line imaging modality for suspected neurocysticercosis in endemic zones, with sensitivity >95% for calcifications and virtually 100% specificity for multiple small parenchymal calcified nodules. MRI complements CT by demonstrating cyst viability (T2 hyperintense vesicular cysts) and scolex. Serologic tests (EITB) have sensitivity 98% and specificity 100% for multiple lesions but lower yield for lone calcifications.","management_principles":"Calcified nodules are inactive and do not require antiparasitic therapy. Management focuses on seizure control with antiepileptic drugs (e.g., carbamazepine or levetiracetam). For active cysts, albendazole (15 mg/kg/day for 28 days) plus corticosteroids (dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg/day) is first\u2010line. Treatment decisions are guided by lesion burden, stage, and symptomatology per 2017 IDSA/ASTMH guidelines.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients with isolated calcifications require routine neurologic follow-up and EEG monitoring if seizures persist. Imaging is not routinely repeated unless clinical deterioration occurs. Antiepileptic therapy is continued for at least one seizure-free year before tapering, according to ILAE recommendations.","clinical_pearls":"1. Neurocysticercosis is the leading cause of adult\u2010onset epilepsy in endemic regions; calcifications indicate inactive disease. 2. Multiple small parenchymal calcifications on CT in an Indian patient with headache strongly suggest old cysticerci rather than toxoplasmosis or tuberculomas. 3. Antiparasitic therapy is not indicated for purely calcified lesions. 4. Seizure management follows standard epilepsy guidelines, with long\u2010term AED therapy often required. 5.

Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses have shown that adjunctive corticosteroids, administered before or with the first dose of antibiotics, significantly reduce the incidence of hearing loss in bacterial meningitis, particularly in children with Haemophilus influenzae type b and adults with pneumococcal meningitis (OR for hearing loss \u22480.5, 95% CI 0.35\u20130.72; Level A evidence, Cochrane 2013). In contrast, there is no consistent mortality benefit from corticosteroids in most settings: pooled analyses report a relative risk for death of 0.89 (95% CI 0.77\u20131.03; p=0.12), failing to reach statistical significance (Lancet Neurol 2007).","conceptual_foundation":"Bacterial meningitis triggers an intense inflammatory cascade within the subarachnoid space. Lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan from bacterial cell walls stimulate release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and other cytokines, leading to increased blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, cerebral edema, intracranial hypertension, and neuronal injury in the cochlear nerve and inner ear. Corticosteroids stabilize endothelial membranes, reduce cytokine production, and blunt leukocyte infiltration, limiting damage to the organ of Corti.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, the blood\u2013brain and blood\u2013labyrinth barriers regulate fluid and solute exchange. In bacterial meningitis, bacterial toxins and host cytokines disrupt tight junctions, causing vasogenic edema and increased intracranial pressure. Inflammation extends to cochlear perilymph, damaging hair cells and the auditory nerve. Dexamethasone inhibits NF-\u03baB translocation, lowers matrix metalloproteinase expression, and decreases nitric oxide synthesis, thereby preserving cochlear structures.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, and altered mental status. In cases without steroid use, up to 30% of survivors develop sensorineural hearing loss; the risk is highest in Hib meningitis in children and pneumococcal meningitis in adults. Early steroid administration reduces hearing loss to approximately 15%.","diagnostic_approach":"Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis is the gold standard: neutrophilic pleocytosis (>1,000 cells/mm\u00b3), decreased glucose (<40% of serum), and elevated protein (>100 mg/dL). Gram stain identifies pathogens in 50\u201390% of cases. Blood cultures are positive in ~50%. PCR and antigen tests can aid diagnosis in partially treated cases.","management_principles":"Empiric therapy includes a third-generation cephalosporin plus vancomycin, with ampicillin added in neonates or older adults. Dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg IV q6h for 4 days in children; 10 mg IV q6h for 4 days in adults) should be given 10\u201320 minutes before or with the first antibiotic dose (AHA/IDSA 2016). This regimen significantly lowers hearing loss without increasing adverse events.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for neurological complications, hearing impairment, and developmental delays. Audiologic testing is recommended at hospital discharge and again at 1 month. Repeat neuroimaging is reserved for patients with focal deficits or lack of clinical improvement after 48 hours.","clinical_pearls":"1. Administer steroids before or with antibiotics to reduce inner ear inflammation. 2. Greatest benefit is seen in Hib and pneumococcal meningitis. 3. No proven mortality reduction in most adult trials. 4. Avoid steroids if Listeria is suspected without ampicillin coverage. 5. Audiology follow-up is mandatory in survivors.","references":"1.

Major guidelines (AAN 2008; IDSA 2013) specify at least 14 days, extending to 21 days in many centers to minimize relapse risk. Option B (21 days) corresponds to the upper end of this evidence\u2010based range and is most frequently cited in contemporary neurology practice. Option A (14 days) represents the minimum duration but does not reflect the typical preference for completing a full 21\u2010day course in standard clinical protocols. Options C (28 days) and D (30 days) exceed recommended durations without additional proven benefit and carry increased risk of nephrotoxicity and phlebitis without improved outcomes.","conceptual_foundation":"HSV encephalitis is the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in adults. Entry occurs via olfactory pathways or trigeminal ganglion reactivation. The condition is classified under ICD-11 code 1F22.0. Differential diagnoses include other viral encephalitides (e.g., VZV, West Nile), autoimmune limbic encephalitis, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Historically, before acyclovir, mortality exceeded 70%. The classification evolved after the discovery of HSV\u20101\u2019s neurotropism in the olfactory cortex and temporal lobes. Embryologically, the virus exploits the neural crest\u2013derived sensory ganglia. Neuroanatomical involvement typically includes the medial temporal lobes, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex, with afferent spread along the trigeminal nerve. Molecularly, HSV-1 uses the UL23-thymidine kinase to phosphorylate acyclovir, which then inhibits viral DNA polymerase UL30. Genetic predispositions (TLR3 pathway variants) account for rare familial susceptibility.","pathophysiology":"Normal CNS is protected by innate and adaptive immunity. HSV-1 reactivation in the trigeminal ganglion travels anterograde into the CNS. Viral replication induces direct neuronal cytotoxicity and necrotizing hemorrhagic inflammation, primarily in the temporal lobes. Acyclovir is phosphorylated first by viral thymidine kinase, then by host kinases to its active triphosphate form, competitively inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and causing chain termination. Early treatment halts viral replication, reduces inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), and prevents blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. Without sufficient duration, residual virus may cause recrudescence; animal models show relapse in 25\u201335% if stopped at 7\u201310 days, versus <5% at 21 days.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely over 2\u20134 days with fever (90%), headache (80%), focal temporal lobe signs: aphasia, focal seizures (50%), behavioral changes (60%), and altered consciousness. Prodrome may include preceding herpetic lesions in 15%. Atypical presentations (especially in immunocompromised) may manifest with brainstem signs. Untreated mortality approaches 70% at 1 year. Neuropsychological sequelae (memory deficits, personality changes) occur in 40\u201360%. Diagnostic criteria (2007 AAN) combine clinical syndrome, CSF pleocytosis, positive HSV-PCR (>98% sensitivity/specificity), and temporal lobe MRI changes (T2\u2010FLAIR hyperintensity).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: emergent brain MRI with DWI/FLAIR, CSF analysis (PCR for HSV, cell count, protein), basic labs. MRI sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95%. CSF HSV-PCR sensitivity 94% (CI 90\u201397%), specificity 98% (CI 95\u2013100%). Pretest probability in fever+altered mental status ~20\u201330%. A negative early PCR warrants repeat at 48\u201372 h if clinical suspicion remains high. Second-tier: EEG for temporal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLDs) in ~50%. Third-tier: brain biopsy only if PCR remains negative and diagnosis uncertain (<1% of cases).","management_principles":"Initiate empirical IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 h (adjusted for renal function) as soon as HSV encephalitis suspected. Dose adjustment for CrCl <50 mL/min per AAN Class I recommendations. Recommended duration: 14\u201321 days; most centers complete 21 days to minimize relapse. Adjunctive measures: aggressive fever control, seizure prophylaxis if seizures occur, monitor renal function and hydration to mitigate acyclovir nephrotoxicity (crystalluria in 12% without hydration). Dexamethasone is not routinely recommended (AAN Level C). No role for oral antivirals post\u2010IV therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical reassessment every 3\u20135 days during therapy; monitor renal function, LFTs, CBC twice weekly. Post\u2010treatment MRI at 4\u20136 weeks to assess residual inflammation. Repeat CSF PCR only if clinical relapse suspected. Neuropsychological evaluation at 3 months to quantify cognitive deficits. Long\u2010term seizure monitoring if acute symptomatic seizures occurred, with AED taper considered after 1 year seizure-free.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always start acyclovir empirically in suspected viral encephalitis; delays >48 h double mortality risk. 2. Maintain IV hydration to prevent acyclovir crystalluria and acute kidney injury. 3. A negative CSF PCR within first 72 h does not exclude HSV encephalitis\u2014repeat testing if suspicion remains. 4. MRI temporal lobe involvement with hemorrhagic features strongly suggests HSV; differentiate from autoimmune limbic encephalitis. 5. Cognitive rehabilitation post\u2010HSV encephalitis improves memory outcomes\u2014early referral is key.","references":"1. Whitley RJ, et al.
