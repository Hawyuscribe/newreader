[{"question_number":"3","question":"A 20-year-old presents with respiratory symptoms, an aneurysm, PAS on pathology, negative forearm exercise diagnosis, and no clinical but electrical myotonia. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Pompe"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Pompe","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A, Pompe disease, best fits the clinical and pathological features. Adult-onset Pompe presents with respiratory muscle weakness, PAS-positive vacuoles on muscle biopsy, a normal forearm exercise test (excluding neuromuscular junction disorder), and electrical myotonia due to muscle fiber membrane irritability. No other options are provided.","conceptual_foundation":"Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency (GAA gene mutations). It is coded as ICD-11 8C21. It spans a spectrum from infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with macroglossia and hypotonia to adult limb-girdle and respiratory-predominant phenotypes.","pathophysiology":"GAA deficiency leads to lysosomal accumulation of glycogen, causing vacuolar myopathy, disruption of autophagy, muscle fiber damage, and membrane irritability. Diaphragmatic involvement explains respiratory symptoms; vacuoles stain PAS-positive.","clinical_manifestation":"Adult-onset Pompe typically presents in the second to fourth decade with progressive proximal and respiratory muscle weakness, frequent respiratory infections, and exercise intolerance. Cardiac involvement is less prominent than in infantile form.","diagnostic_approach":"Measurement of GAA enzymatic activity in leukocytes or fibroblasts confirms the diagnosis. Genetic testing identifies GAA mutations. Muscle biopsy shows PAS-positive vacuoles. EMG may show myotonic discharges.","management_principles":"Enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa improves survival, pulmonary function, and motor outcomes. Supportive respiratory care (noninvasive ventilation), physical therapy, and nutritional support are adjunctive.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular monitoring of forced vital capacity (upright and supine), muscle strength assessments, antibody titers against ERT, and periodic cardiac evaluations are recommended every 3\u20136 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Respiratory weakness may precede limb weakness. 2. PAS-positive vacuoles on biopsy are diagnostic. 3. ERT is most effective when started early. 4. Infantile and adult forms differ by cardiac involvement. 5. Normal forearm exercise test excludes neuromuscular transmission disorders.","references":"1. Kishnani PS et al.

What would you expect to see on day 5 during nerve conduction studies (NCS) or electromyography (EMG)?","options":["Normal CMAP, SNAP, and latency","Prolonged latency, normal CMAP, absent SNAPs","No mention of decreased recruitment or late reflexes","(Option missing)"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Prolonged latency, normal CMAP, absent SNAPs","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B is correct because in early Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), typically around day 5, nerve conduction studies reveal demyelinating features including prolonged distal latencies and F-wave latencies, while compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes may still be preserved and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) can be absent or markedly reduced in severe demyelination. Option A is incorrect because completely normal CMAP, SNAP, and latencies are not expected by day 5 in a typical AIDP presentation. Option C is not an answer choice but suggests ignoring decreased recruitment or late reflexes, which is misleading\u2014early GBS often demonstrates decreased recruitment on voluntary EMG examination and absent F-waves. The absence of EMG denervation potentials this early helps distinguish demyelinating from axonal variants.","conceptual_foundation":"Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is an acute monophasic immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy classified under ICD-11 8A40. The most common form is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP). Differential diagnoses include acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Historically described by Guillain, Barr\u00e9, and Strohl in 1916, the understanding evolved from purely clinical syndrome to immunopathologic processes involving both humoral and cellular immunity directed at peripheral myelin. The target antigens include gangliosides (e.g., GM1, GD1a) leading to complement\u2010mediated demyelination. Key anatomic substrates are spinal nerve roots and peripheral nerves; Schwann cell dysfunction underlies conduction slowing.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, peripheral myelinated fibers conduct impulses rapidly via saltatory conduction. In GBS, autoantibody binding to myelin-associated glycoprotein and other epitopes triggers complement activation, macrophage recruitment, and segmental demyelination. This interrupts saltatory conduction, prolongs latencies, and may cause conduction block. Early changes appear within days: nodal sodium channels disperse, leading to reversible conduction failure. Axonal degeneration occurs later if demyelination is severe. The absence of denervation potentials on EMG by day 5 reflects the time needed for Wallerian-like degeneration to generate fibrillation potentials, which typically appear after 1\u20133 weeks.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients classically present with ascending symmetric weakness, areflexia, and variable sensory symptoms (paresthesia, pain). Bone pain can occur early. Peak weakness is reached within 2\u20134 weeks. Variants include Miller Fisher syndrome (ophthalmoplegia, ataxia), pharyngeal\u2013cervical\u2013brachial weakness, and bifacial diplegia. Respiratory involvement occurs in ~25% requiring ventilatory support. CSF albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein >0.55 g/L with <10 cells/mm\u00b3) appears after the first week in most cases.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: NCS/EMG and lumbar puncture. NCS shows slowed conduction velocity (<70% normal), prolonged distal latencies, conduction block, and prolonged or absent F-waves. Sensitivity ~80% by week 2. EMG early shows normal motor unit potentials with reduced recruitment. CSF demonstrates albuminocytologic dissociation in ~50% by day 5, rising to 80% by week 2. Second-tier: antiganglioside antibody testing may support AMAN variant (<50% sensitivity). MRI of spine with gadolinium may show root enhancement. Third-tier: nerve biopsy rarely indicated except to exclude vasculitis or amyloidosis.","management_principles":"First-line immunotherapy: intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days or plasmapheresis (4\u20136 exchanges over 1\u20132 weeks) both reduce time to recovery (Level A, AAN 2019). Supportive care includes monitoring for autonomic instability, DVT prophylaxis, and respiratory function. No proven benefit of corticosteroids. Experimental therapies (e.g., eculizumab) are under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor pulmonary function (vital capacity) daily until stable. Repeat NCS at 2\u20134 weeks to document conduction recovery. Assess functional status (e.g., MRC sum score) weekly. Long-term follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months to evaluate residual deficits. Physical and occupational therapy should begin early to prevent contractures and deconditioning.","clinical_pearls":"1. F-wave latency prolongation is the most sensitive early NCS abnormality in AIDP. 2. Albuminocytologic dissociation may be absent in the first week\u2014don\u2019t exclude GBS if initial CSF is normal. 3. IVIG and plasmapheresis are equally effective; do not combine them. 4. Respiratory decline can be rapid\u2014measure vital capacity every 4\u20136 hours in severe cases. 5. Pain occurs in up to 50% of patients and requires aggressive analgesia.","references":"1.
