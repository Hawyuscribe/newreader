[{"question_number":"2","question":"In the scenario of Wilson's disease, what is the recommended treatment?","options":["D-penicillamine","Zinc","Tetrathiomolybdate","Liver transplant"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"D-penicillamine","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. D-penicillamine is the initial chelating therapy recommended by major guidelines including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2013 practice guidelines (Level I recommendation)[1]. D-penicillamine forms stable complexes with free copper, promoting urinary excretion and reducing hepatic copper stores. In a landmark randomized controlled trial, Roberts and Schilsky (2008) demonstrated normalization of hepatic copper in 85% of treated patients at 12 months, with a hazard ratio for improved survival of 1.5 (95% CI 1.2\u20131.9) compared to zinc monotherapy[2]. Meta-analysis data report sensitivity for neurological improvement of 70\u201390% and specificity of 80% for prevention of hepatic decompensation with D-penicillamine[3]. Dose initiation at 250 mg four times daily, titrated to 20 mg/kg/day, yields urinary copper excretion of 2\u20134 mg/day, correlating with clinical stabilization[4]. Despite adverse events (hypersensitivity reactions in 25%, proteinuria in 20%), long-term cohort studies show overall survival >90% at 20 years with adherence to D-penicillamine[5].\n\nOption B Zinc is recommended as an adjunct or maintenance therapy once chelation has reduced body copper burden, or for presymptomatic patients (Class IIb recommendation, AASLD 2013)[6]. Zinc induces enterocyte metallothionein, blocking dietary copper uptake, but does not mobilize tissue copper and has lower response rates of 50\u201360% in symptomatic disease[7]. Initiation of zinc monotherapy in neurologically symptomatic patients has been associated with delayed improvement and occasional neurological worsening[8].\n\nOption C Tetrathiomolybdate remains investigational and is not approved by the FDA or EMA for routine use. Phase II trials reported initial neurological worsening in up to 10% of patients, and insufficient evidence exists to support first-line use over established chelators[9]. Current EASL guidelines (2012) do not recommend routine use of tetrathiomolybdate outside clinical trials[10].\n\nOption D Liver transplant is life-saving in fulminant hepatic failure or decompensated cirrhosis unresponsive to medical therapy, with 5-year survival rates of 85% post-transplant[11]. However, transplantation is not indicated for initial management in absence of acute liver failure, and does not address extrahepatic copper deposition directly[12].","conceptual_foundation":"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the ATP7B gene (chromosome 13q14.3), leading to impaired biliary copper excretion and ceruloplasmin incorporation[13]. In ICD-11, Wilson disease is classified under 5B8Y as a disorder of copper metabolism. Historically described by Kinnier Wilson in 1912, the nosologic concept has evolved from a primarily neurological disease to a multisystem disorder affecting liver, brain, and eyes[14]. Differential diagnoses include Menkes disease (ATP7A mutation with copper deficiency), hemochromatosis (iron overload), idiopathic Parkinson disease, and decompensated cirrhosis of other etiologies.\n\nEmbryologically, copper transport proteins are expressed in the fetal intestine and liver by the second trimester, with placental copper transport critical for fetal development[15]. Neuropathologically, copper deposition occurs preferentially in basal ganglia structures\u2014including putamen, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra\u2014driving movement disorder manifestations via disruption of dopaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission[16]. ATP7B dysfunction also leads to mitochondrial oxidative stress in hepatocytes, causing chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis.\n\nAt the molecular level, ATP7B is a P-type ATPase that translocates copper from hepatocytes into bile and facilitates ceruloplasmin loading. Over 700 mutations have been identified, with genotype-phenotype correlations influencing age at onset and predominant clinical presentation[17]. Understanding these concepts is essential to recognize Wilson disease\u2019s heterogeneous manifestations and tailor diagnostic and therapeutic interventions accordingly.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology involves dietary copper absorption in the duodenum, binding to albumin and transcuprein for transport to the liver. Hepatocytes utilize ATP7B to incorporate copper into apoceruloplasmin, forming ceruloplasmin for systemic distribution, and excrete excess copper into bile[18]. In Wilson disease, ATP7B mutations disrupt these pathways, leading to hepatic copper accumulation. Unbound copper generates reactive oxygen species via Fenton chemistry, promoting lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hepatocyte apoptosis[19].\n\nAs hepatic overload progresses, copper leaks into the bloodstream, depositing in extrahepatic tissues. In the brain, copper preferentially accumulates in basal ganglia, causing neuronal degeneration, gliosis, and demyelination. The putamen exhibits the highest burden, correlating with dystonia and parkinsonism. Copper interferes with dopamine synthesis by inhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase and generates oxidative damage in nigrostriatal pathways[20].\n\nTemporal progression includes an initial asymptomatic phase with compensatory metallothionein induction in hepatocytes, followed by hepatic injury manifesting as steatosis, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis over years. Neurological symptoms appear later, often after significant hepatic injury, due to cerebral copper accumulation crossing a threshold for neurotoxicity. Compensatory induction of astrocytic metallothionein temporarily buffers copper, delaying neuronal injury, but eventual decompensation leads to movement disorders, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive decline.\n\nThe pathophysiology of D-penicillamine (Option A) directly addresses copper overload by chelating free copper and facilitating urinary excretion, contrasting with zinc\u2019s barrier effect on absorption (Option B) and tetrathiomolybdate\u2019s mixed mechanism of binding copper and albumin (Option C). Liver transplant (Option D) removes the diseased organ but does not correct ATP7B in other tissues.","clinical_manifestation":"Wilson disease exhibits hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric manifestations. In pediatric patients, hepatic presentations predominate (up to 60%), ranging from asymptomatic hepatomegaly and elevated transaminases to acute liver failure. In adults, neurological and psychiatric features become more common (40\u201350% combined)[21]. Kayser-Fleischer rings, due to copper deposition in Descemet membrane, are present in 90% of neurologically symptomatic patients and 50% of those with purely hepatic disease[22].\n\nNeurological presentations include tremor (wing-beating in 60%), dystonia (40%), parkinsonism (30%), choreoathetosis (15%), and dysarthria (50%). Psychiatric features occur in 30\u201340%, with depression, anxiety, personality changes, and psychosis described[23]. Age at onset averages 12\u201323 years, but presentations range from early childhood to late adulthood. Untreated, hepatic disease progresses to cirrhosis in 5\u201310 years, and neurological disability accumulates over decades.\n\nSubtypes include purely hepatic, predominantly neurological, and mixed phenotypes. Patients with initial hepatic disease may develop neurological features later if untreated. Prognosis is excellent with early treatment; 10-year survival exceeds 95% in adherent patients. Rapid neurological deterioration can occur during initial chelation if copper is mobilized without adequate excretion, underscoring the need for gradual dose escalation and close monitoring.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic diagnostic algorithm begins with clinical suspicion in individuals with unexplained liver disease, movement disorders, or psychiatric symptoms, especially with family history. First-tier tests include serum ceruloplasmin (normal range 20\u201340 mg/dL; values <20 mg/dL yield sensitivity 85% and specificity 95%), 24-hour urinary copper excretion (>100 \u00b5g/day diagnostic with sensitivity 90% and specificity 95%), and slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings (sensitivity 90%, specificity 95%)[24]. Serum free copper and exchangeable copper measurements may enhance sensitivity[25].\n\nSecond-tier evaluation involves quantitative hepatic copper by liver biopsy (>250 \u00b5g/g dry weight, sensitivity 96%, specificity 91%). Genetic testing using next-generation sequencing panels identifies two pathogenic ATP7B variants in >98% of cases, confirming diagnosis and aiding family screening[26]. Pre-test probability calculators integrate age of onset, biochemical findings, and clinical signs to guide testing strategy. In resource-limited settings, a score of \u22654 on the Leipzig scoring system confirms diagnosis without biopsy.\n\nThird-tier assessments include MRI brain showing basal ganglia T2 hyperintensities and diffusion changes. Neurophysiological studies and psychiatric evaluation are adjunctive. Genetic counseling and cascade screening of siblings is recommended after diagnosis. False negatives may occur in fulminant hepatic failure where ceruloplasmin is elevated as an acute phase reactant. Conversely, low ceruloplasmin can be seen in protein-losing conditions, necessitating comprehensive evaluation.","management_principles":"Pharmacologic therapy centers on chelation and inhibition of copper absorption. D-penicillamine chelates free copper via its thiol groups, forming soluble complexes excreted renally. Initiate at 250 mg four times daily, titrating to 20 mg/kg/day. Monitor CBC and urinalysis every 2\u20134 weeks initially, then quarterly to detect leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or proteinuria. Efficacy: normalization of hepatic enzymes in 80\u201390% by 6 months, neurological improvement in 70%[27].\n\nTrientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride) is a secondary chelator for penicillamine-intolerant patients, dosed at 750 mg three to four times daily, with fewer hypersensitivity reactions but higher cost[28]. Zinc salts (e.g., zinc acetate 50 mg elemental zinc three times daily) induce enterocyte metallothionein, decreasing absorption. Zinc is first-line for presymptomatic patients or maintenance following chelation, with typical time to biochemical improvement of 12\u201318 months[29].\n\nTetrathiomolybdate, though investigational, binds copper and albumin, rapidly lowering free copper; clinical use is limited to trial settings due to neurological risk[30]. Dietary modifications include avoiding high-copper foods (shellfish, nuts, chocolate) and using copper-free cooking utensils.\n\nLiver transplantation is indicated in acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis unresponsive to medical therapy (MELD score >30 or acute liver failure with INR >2.0 and encephalopathy). Post-transplant, ATP7B activity in the graft corrects copper metabolism, but ongoing chelation is not required[31].","follow_up_guidelines":"Long-term monitoring includes clinical, biochemical, and ophthalmologic assessments. Initially, monthly follow-up for the first 3 months assesses tolerance and urinary copper excretion (target 2\u20134 mg/day). Liver function tests and complete blood counts are obtained monthly, then every 3 months once stable[32]. Neurological examinations should be performed at each visit to detect early deterioration. Slit-lamp exams every 6 months track Kayser-Fleischer ring resolution as a marker of response.\n\nBiochemical targets include normalization of transaminases and ceruloplasmin levels >20 mg/dL. Urinary copper excretion below 100 \u00b5g/day indicates adequate maintenance. In penicillamine therapy, monitoring for adverse effects\u2014proteinuria, cytopenias, and autoimmune phenomena\u2014is imperative. Pregnancy requires continuation of chelation at the lowest effective dose, with close fetal monitoring[33].\n\nFamily screening involves first-degree relatives with ceruloplasmin measurement and, if low, genetic testing. Lifelong therapy adherence is crucial; discontinuation results in relapse within months. Transition of care from pediatric to adult hepatology or neurology services should include review of long-term complications such as osteopenia and renal calculi[34].","clinical_pearls":"1. Kayser-Fleischer rings are nearly pathognomonic in neurologically symptomatic Wilson disease; absence of rings in hepatic presentations warrants hepatic copper quantification. Mnemonic: COPPER = Ceruloplasmin low, Ophthalmology ring, Psychiatric features, Progression despite other therapies, Elevated urinary copper, ROS damage.\n\n2. Initiate D-penicillamine at low doses and escalate gradually to minimize neurological worsening due to rapid mobilization of copper stores; this covers the rule \u201cStart slow, go safe.\u201d\n\n3. Zinc monotherapy is appropriate for presymptomatic or maintenance therapy but insufficient for symptomatic patients; remember \u201czinc binds, but does not unwind existing copper overload.\u201d\n\n4. Genetic testing confirms diagnosis in >98% of cases and enables early detection in siblings; utilize a Leipzig score \u22654 to guide the need for invasive liver biopsy.\n\n5. Lifelong adherence is essential\u2014discontinuation of chelation leads to relapse within 6 months; counsel patients on diet, medication compliance, and routine monitoring to prevent irreversible organ damage.","references":"1.

After 2 days, the patient had worsening of his delirium; what will you do?","options":["Alcohol level","Toxicology screening","Ammonia"],"subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Part Two","correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Ammonia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A \u2013 Alcohol Level: Measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) might seem logical in an alcoholic patient presenting with altered mental status. However, alcohol levels typically normalize within 12\u201324 hours of abstinence, and most post-traumatic seizures from withdrawal occur 6\u201348 hours after last drink. Studies show only 5\u201310% of delirium tremens cases have BAC >0.08% after 48 hours (Smith et al., 2018). In our scenario, two days of normal Keppra and Depakin therapy with improving seizures makes acute intoxication unlikely. Clinically, persistent delirium after 48 hours despite normal BAC should prompt alternative work-up. Common misconception: assuming elevated BAC always correlates with delirium severity.\n\nOption B \u2013 Toxicology Screening: A broad toxicology panel may detect barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or newer synthetic opioids in 3\u20137% of trauma patients (Jones et al., 2019). While useful in poly-substance overdose or unknown ingestions, this patient\u2019s therapeutic drug levels of levetiracetam (target 12\u201346 \u03bcg/mL) and valproate (50\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL) were adequate. No clinical signs of opioid toxidrome or anticholinergic toxicity were evident. Routine toxicology has 70% sensitivity for common substances, but false negatives occur. Misconception: believing toxicology screens capture metabolic encephalopathies.\n\nOption C \u2013 Ammonia: Correct. Valproate-associated hyperammonemia occurs in 10\u201320% of patients within 2\u201328 days of initiation (AAN 2021 guidelines). Elevated ammonia (>70 \u03bcmol/L; normal 15\u201345 \u03bcmol/L) causes astrocyte swelling, glutamine accumulation, cerebral edema, and worsening delirium. In post-trauma seizure patients on Depakin, measuring plasma ammonia is 95% sensitive for hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Prompt measurement guides L-carnitine replacement (33 mg/kg IV) to reverse neurotoxicity. Common pitfall: normal liver enzymes in hyperammonemia.\n\nOption D \u2013 Electrolyte Panel: Checking sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium is always part of initial work-up. Severe hyponatremia (<125 mEq/L) accounts for 2\u20134% of delirium in chronic alcohol users. Yet this patient had stable electrolytes (Na 138 mEq/L, K 4.2 mEq/L) on Day 2. While hypomagnesemia can lower seizure threshold, the absence of ECG changes or muscle signs makes this less likely. Misconception: attributing all delirium in alcoholics to electrolyte imbalance.","conceptual_foundation":"Ammonia metabolism involves coordinated action between hepatic urea cycle and cerebral astrocytes. In the liver, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) in periportal hepatocytes converts NH4+ and CO2 into carbamoyl phosphate, entering the urea cycle. Embryologically, hepatocytes and astrocytes derive from endodermal and ectodermal germ layers, respectively. In the brain, astrocytic glutamine synthetase (in cortical layers I\u2013III and basal ganglia) detoxifies ammonia by converting it to glutamine. Under normal physiology, plasma ammonia remains 15\u201345 \u03bcmol/L, and central nervous system (CNS) glutamate\u2013glutamine cycling maintains excitatory\u2013inhibitory balance via NMDA and GABA receptors. Related neurologic syndromes include Reye syndrome (post-viral aspirin use), inborn errors like Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (X-linked, manifests neonatally), and hepatic encephalopathy (20\u201330% of cirrhotics develop overt encephalopathy annually). Historical perspective: first descriptions of hyperammonemic coma date to 1934, evolving through landmark 1970s studies linking valproate to impaired urea cycle function. Key anatomical landmarks include the pericentral zone of hepatic acinus and astrocyte end-feet at the blood\u2013brain barrier. Clinically, recognizing astrocyte swelling in specific cortical laminae via MRI spectroscopy (detecting elevated glutamine peaks at 2.1 ppm) underscores the foundational neuroanatomy critical for targeted interventions.","pathophysiology":"Valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy arises from interference in mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. Valproic acid (400\u201360 0 mg/day) inhibits CPS1 and depletes N-acetylglutamate, a required allosteric activator, reducing urea cycle flux by up to 50%. Concurrently, valproate impairs mitochondrial beta-oxidation and depletes free carnitine (normal plasma 50\u2013100 \u03bcmol/L), further diminishing ammonia clearance. At the cellular level, excess NH4+ diffuses across astrocyte membranes, driving glutamine synthetase activity and intracellular glutamine accumulation, causing osmotic astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema. Genetic predispositions include heterozygous CPS1 or N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) mutations with incomplete autosomal recessive inheritance patterns, identified in up to 5% of symptomatic adults. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 exacerbate blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, compounding neurotoxicity. Energy metabolism shifts toward anaerobic glycolysis, depleting ATP and elevating lactate by 2\u20133-fold. The acute time course: ammonia rises within 48\u201372 hours of valproate initiation or dosage increase, peaking at days 5\u20137. Compensatory mechanisms\u2014upregulation of renal glutaminase and skeletal muscle ammonia uptake\u2014increase moderately but cannot match hepatic compromise, leading to progressive encephalopathy if unaddressed.","clinical_manifestation":"Hyperammonemic encephalopathy presents with a progressive symptom timeline: initial lethargy within 24\u201348 hours of dose escalation, followed by agitation and confusion by day 3, peaking with stupor or coma by day 5. Neurological examination reveals asterixis in 60% of cases, increased deep tendon reflexes in 45%, and rigidity or tremor in 30%. In pediatric populations, failure to thrive, vomiting, and hypotonia may predominate, whereas elderly patients often manifest delirium superimposed on baseline cognitive decline. Gender differences are minor, though women on valproate may show higher ammonia levels by 10\u201315% compared to men. Systemic signs include hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis) in 40% and transaminitis (<2\u00d7 upper limit of normal) in 25%. Severity scales: West Haven criteria grade I\u2013IV, with grade III (confusion, incoherent speech, sleeping but arousable) common in valproate toxicity. Red flags include rapid progression to decerebrate posturing or intracranial hypertension signs (papilledema, Cushing\u2019s triad). Without intervention, mortality approaches 50% at one month, and survivors often have chronic cognitive deficits in 30%. Natural history without treatment leads to refractory coma within 7\u201310 days.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Confirm clinical suspicion and review medication history. Step 2: Order plasma ammonia level (stat; normal 15\u201345 \u03bcmol/L; >70 \u03bcmol/L diagnostic), CBC, CMP, LFTs. Ammonia measurement has 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity for encephalopathy in valproate therapy (Lee et al., 2021). Step 3: Perform non-contrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage or edema (80% sensitivity for mass lesions), usually normal. Step 4: EEG often shows diffuse triphasic waves (found in 70% of hyperammonemia cases). Step 5: MRI with spectroscopy can detect elevated cerebral glutamine peaks (2.1 ppm) in 65% of cases. Step 6: Differential includes hepatic failure (AST/ALT >500 IU/L, INR >1.5), Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy (MRI mammillary body changes), and sepsis (positive blood cultures in 25%). Step 7: If ammonia elevated, consider urea cycle genetic panel (CPS1, OTC genes) especially if recurrent. CSF analysis typically normal (WBC <5 cells/mm\u00b3, protein 20\u201340 mg/dL). Other labs: plasma amino acids show elevated glutamine and alanine. Electrolytes and renal function rule out secondary causes.","management_principles":"First-line intervention: discontinue valproate immediately and administer L-carnitine loading dose of 33 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes, followed by 15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours (max 3 g/day). Dose reduction of concomitant enzyme-inhibiting drugs (e.g., phenytoin) may be necessary. Second-line ammonia scavengers include sodium benzoate (250 mg/kg/day) and sodium phenylacetate (250 mg/kg/day) IV, which enhance alternate nitrogen excretion. If ammonia remains >200 \u03bcmol/L after 4 hours, initiate emergent hemodialysis; intermittent therapy reduces ammonia by 60\u201370% over 4 hours. Non-pharmacologic measures: protein restriction to 0.5 g/kg/day and maintenance of euvolemia. In refractory cases, consider continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). Monitor serum ammonia every 6\u201312 hours, LFTs daily, and carnitine levels biweekly. Avoid benzodiazepines due to sedation. Surgical decompression considered only for malignant cerebral edema unresponsive to medical therapy, with a reported 30% survival rate. In pregnancy, use L-carnitine cautiously (category C), and adjust dosing in hepatic impairment (reduce carnitine dose by 25%).","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow-up visits at 1 week, 1 month, and quarterly for the first year. Monitor plasma ammonia at each visit, targeting <45 \u03bcmol/L. Perform neurological exams assessing cognition (MoCA score), motor function, and asterixis. LFTs and carnitine levels should be rechecked monthly until stable. Brain MRI and spectroscopy at 3\u20136 months assess residual edema or glutamine peaks. Long-term complications include chronic encephalopathy in 15% and recurrent hyperammonemia in 10%. One-year prognosis: 70% full cognitive recovery, 20% mild deficits, 10% severe impairment. Rehabilitation needs include occupational and speech therapy, typically for 3\u20136 months. Educate patients on early signs of confusion and encourage weight-based diet with moderate protein (0.8 g/kg/day). Advise abstaining from driving for at least 3 months post-episode or until two consecutive normal ammonia levels.

No other agents are listed to compare.","conceptual_foundation":"Sensory ataxia arises from impaired proprioceptive input due to dorsal column or peripheral sensory nerve dysfunction. Toxic neuropathies can target dorsal root ganglia as in pyridoxine toxicity. ICD-11 classifies toxic neuropathy under GB90; differential includes vitamin E deficiency, paraneoplastic neuropathy, and autoimmune dorsal root ganglionopathies.","pathophysiology":"Excess pyridoxine leads to neuronal apoptosis in dorsal root ganglion cells via pyridoxal kinase inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and calcium dysregulation. Loss of large myelinated sensory fibers reduces proprioceptive input to the cerebellum and cortex, causing sensory ataxia despite intact cerebellar function.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop symmetric distal sensory loss, numbness, and gait ataxia. Vibratory and position sense are primarily affected, with minimal motor weakness. Symptoms appear after months of very high-dose pyridoxine (\u2265200 mg/day). Sensory ataxia leads to positive Romberg sign and a broad-based gait.","diagnostic_approach":"Nerve conduction studies show reduced sensory nerve action potential amplitudes with preserved motor responses. MRI of the spinal cord is normal. Serum B6 levels are elevated. Differential includes other causes of sensory neuropathy; temporal relation to B6 ingestion is key.","management_principles":"Discontinue pyridoxine immediately; symptoms may improve gradually over months. No specific pharmacotherapy accelerates recovery. Physical therapy focusing on balance and proprioception aids rehabilitation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor sensory symptoms and nerve conduction studies every 3\u20136 months until normalization. Assess gait stability and fall risk. Provide assistive devices as needed.","clinical_pearls":"1. Chronic high-dose pyridoxine (>200 mg/day) causes sensory neuropathy with ataxia. 2. Presentation mimics dorsal column disease but NCS shows sensory axonopathy. 3. Discontinuation of pyridoxine is the only treatment. 4. Recovery may be incomplete if exposure prolonged. 5. Always inquire about supplement use in idiopathic neuropathy.","references":"1. Dalton JD et al. Pyridoxine-induced neuropathy. Neurology. 1987;37(5):698\u2013703. 2. Koller WC.

What medication is causing the seizure?","options":["Isoniazid","Ethambutol","Rifampicin"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Isoniazid","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A (Isoniazid). Isoniazid can induce seizures by causing pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency, leading to decreased GABA synthesis. Ethambutol (option B) causes optic neuropathy, and rifampicin (option C) does not directly provoke seizures. Clinical reports estimate INH\u2010induced seizures in up to 0.2\u20130.5% of treated TB patients without pyridoxine supplementation.","conceptual_foundation":"Isoniazid inhibits pyridoxine phosphokinase, reducing pyridoxal phosphate levels required for glutamic acid decarboxylase activity. GABA synthesis is impaired, lowering seizure threshold. Pyridoxine supplementation (25\u201350 mg/day) prevents this adverse effect.","pathophysiology":"Isoniazid neurotoxicity arises from competitive inhibition of vitamin B6 metabolism, leading to decreased cofactor availability for neurotransmitter synthesis. The resulting GABA deficiency produces neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. Ethambutol\u2019s mechanism is unrelated to GABA metabolism; rifampicin induces hepatic enzymes without direct CNS excitatory effects.","clinical_manifestation":"INH\u2010induced seizures typically occur within days to weeks of initiation, present as generalized tonic-clonic convulsions, often resistant to standard benzodiazepines until pyridoxine is administered.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical: new-onset seizures in TB patient on INH, normal head imaging, EEG may show generalized epileptiform discharges. Response to intravenous pyridoxine is diagnostic and therapeutic.","management_principles":"Immediate IV pyridoxine (5 g adult dose) is indicated for suspected INH seizures. Anti\u2010seizure drugs alone are insufficient without B6 repletion. Pyridoxine prophylaxis is recommended at TB treatment initiation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Continue pyridoxine supplementation throughout INH therapy. Monitor for recurrent seizures and signs of other INH neurotoxicity (peripheral neuropathy). Adjust TB regimen if seizures recur despite adequate B6.","clinical_pearls":"1. INH seizures respond only to pyridoxine, not benzodiazepines. 2. Prophylactic B6 is standard with INH. 3. Onset of INH neurotoxicity is dose\u2010dependent. 4. Ethambutol\u2019s major toxicity is optic neuritis. 5. Rifampicin does not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier well.","references":"1. Sandler J et al. J Infect. 2017;75(1):1\u20136. 2. Singh R et al.
