Option B meets 2017 McDonald dissemination in space criteria by MRI alone. Option A has only two spinal lesions and negative oligoclonal bands (OCB), reducing predictive value. Option C\u2019s serum OCB is non-specific; OCB in CSF is required.","conceptual_foundation":"MS is an autoimmune demyelinating disease diagnosed by dissemination in space and time, per 2017 McDonald criteria. Differential includes small vessel ischemic disease, migraine-related white matter lesions, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. RIS describes incidental MRI findings fulfilling MS radiological criteria without clinical events.","pathophysiology":"MS involves autoreactive T and B lymphocytes breaching the blood\u2013brain barrier via upregulated adhesion molecules, leading to perivenular inflammatory demyelination, axonal transection, and gliosis. Lesions in periventricular and cerebellar regions reflect venule distribution and watershed areas.","clinical_manifestation":"RIS patients are asymptomatic but carry radiological features typical of MS. High lesion load in infratentorial sites predicts clinical conversion. Women in their 30s have highest disease incidence. OCB positivity in CSF (not serum) further increases risk.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line workup for RIS includes full-brain and spinal MRI with contrast, CSF analysis for OCB, and evoked potentials. No clinical events, so no treatment is initiated; close monitoring every 6\u201312 months.","management_principles":"Disease-modifying therapy is typically reserved for clinically definite MS. In high-risk RIS (multiple infratentorial lesions plus positive CSF OCB), early treatment may be considered in specialized centers per ongoing trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Surveillance MRI at 12 months; neurological exam every 6 months.

Mult Scler. 2015;21(7):875\u2013882). Option A (acetazolamide) is used for idiopathic intracranial hypertension or episodic ataxia, not spasticity. Option B (carbamazepine) treats trigeminal neuralgia and seizures but is not first-line for diffuse spasticity.","conceptual_foundation":"Spasticity arises from upper motor neuron lesions disrupting inhibitory descending pathways. In multiple sclerosis (ICD-11 8A40), demyelinated plaques in corticospinal tracts lead to increased tonic stretch reflexes. Management targets muscle hyperexcitability.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor control balances excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic inputs. Demyelination impairs conduction in inhibitory interneurons, unmasking spinal reflexes. Diazepam enhances GABAergic inhibition at the \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunits of GABA-A receptors in spinal cord, reducing spasm frequency and intensity.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients experience velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone, painful clonus, and contractures. MS-related spasticity affects 60\u201390% of patients over the disease course. Symptoms worsen with heat and stress, commonly in lower limbs but may involve upper limbs as in this case.","diagnostic_approach":"Spasticity assessment uses the Modified Ashworth Scale (0\u20134). MRI confirms stable demyelination without new lesions, ruling out acute relapse. Rule out electrolyte disturbances, infections, and other causes of increased tone.","management_principles":"First-line therapies for MS spasticity are baclofen and tizanidine (AAN 2018 Level A).

What laboratory test should be ordered?","options":["Anti-phospholipid antibodies","Complete blood count","Thyroid function tests","Coagulation profile"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Anti-phospholipid antibodies","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Anti-phospholipid antibodies): This is the definitive laboratory test in a young woman with recurrent miscarriages (\u22652) and livedo reticularis. Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) is diagnosed by persistently elevated anti-cardiolipin IgG/IgM or anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein I levels, and/or lupus anticoagulant on two occasions \u226512 weeks apart. Up to 40% of women with two miscarriages and livedo reticularis test positive. The 2006 revised Sapporo criteria and 2019 EULAR guidelines recommend screening with ELISA (normal <20 GPL or MPL units) and dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) following established cut-offs. Common misconceptions include ordering a coagulation profile alone and expecting a prolonged PT/PTT, when lupus anticoagulant paradoxically prolongs PTT but thrombosis risk increases.\n\nOption B (Complete blood count): While a CBC is useful to detect cytopenias (e.g., thrombocytopenia in SLE or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), it does not confirm APS. It might be considered if there were unexplained anemia or platelet counts <100\u00d710^9/L, but it lacks specificity for prothrombotic states.\n\nOption C (Thyroid function tests): Indicated for miscarriage workups when autoimmune thyroid disease is suspected. However, normal TSH (0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L) and free T4 (0.8\u20131.8 ng/dL) do not explain livedo reticularis or thrombotic microangiopathy. Thyroid autoantibodies (anti-TG, anti-TPO) rarely associate with livedo changes.\n\nOption D (Coagulation profile): A standard PT/INR (normal INR 0.9\u20131.2) and PTT (25\u201336 sec) screen for hemophilia or warfarin therapy effects but lack sensitivity for APS. Lupus anticoagulant may prolong PTT in 20\u201330% of cases, yet normal clotting times do not rule out strongly positive anti-phospholipid antibodies. Misinterpretation of a normal coagulation profile as exclusion of APS is a frequent error.","conceptual_foundation":"Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) arises from autoantibodies directed against phospholipid-binding proteins, primarily \u03b22-glycoprotein I and prothrombin, affecting coagulation pathways. Anatomical structures impacted include the endothelium of small vessels in the placenta, dermal capillaries causing livedo reticularis, and cerebral microvasculature leading to stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Embryologically, placental vasculature and spiral arteries can be damaged by complement activation triggered by these antibodies from early trophoblast invasion at 6\u201310 weeks gestation. Normally, antiphospholipid antibodies are absent or at low titers (<20 GPL units). In APS, high titers (>40 GPL or >99th percentile) disrupt annexin V binding, impairing anticoagulant shields. Historical descriptions date to 1983 (Hughes syndrome) when recurrent miscarriages were linked to lupus anticoagulant. Over the last four decades, diagnostic criteria have evolved from solely clinical to combined serologic and clinical frameworks. Key anatomical landmarks include the uterine spiral arteries, the superficial dermal plexus in the skin, and the cerebral circle of Willis, all susceptible to thrombosis. Recognition of these sites guides imaging and biopsy decisions. APS overlaps with other autoimmune neurologic conditions such as SLE-associated vasculopathy, requiring multidisciplinary evaluation.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I antibodies bind domain I of \u03b22GPI on activated endothelium, exposing phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells and trophoblasts. This antigen\u2013antibody complex engages Toll-like receptor 4 and annexin A2, initiating NF-\u03baB signaling and upregulation of tissue factor gene expression, leading to thrombin generation. Complement activation products (C3a, C5a) recruit neutrophils, which release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that further propagate clot formation. Genetic predisposition includes HLA-DR7 and HLA-DQ2 haplotypes, and polymorphisms in the \u03b22GPI gene on chromosome 17q24. Inherited thrombophilic co-factors (Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A) are present in 10\u201315% of APS patients, amplifying risk. Time course: subclinical autoantibody formation can precede clinical events by years; placental thrombosis manifests by 10\u201312 weeks gestation. Compensatory fibrinolysis (tPA release) is overwhelmed by persistent antiphospholipid antibody titers, with PAI-1 overexpression hindering clot resolution. Chronic, low-grade vascular inflammation leads to intimal hyperplasia and luminal narrowing, limiting blood flow in critical organs. As immune complexes deposit, monocyte-derived macrophages produce IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, perpetuating endothelial injury and microangiopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"APS manifests variably by age. In women of reproductive age (20\u201340 years), the most common presentation is recurrent early fetal loss (\u22652 miscarriages before 10 weeks) and late losses (\u22651 after 10 weeks). Onset of livedo reticularis often predates obstetric complications by months to years, presenting as reticular, violaceous skin mottling on lower limbs. Neurologic signs include ischemic stroke in 5\u201310% by age 35, focal deficits corresponding to MCA territory, cognitive fog, and migraine with aura in 20\u201330%. Complete neurological exam may reveal mild hemiparesis, hyperreflexia, or sensory deficits. Pediatric cases present with chorea or seizures. Elderly patients are more likely to develop dementia and atypical small vessel vasculopathy. Gender differences: men with APS exhibit more venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis in 25%), while women have higher arterial events (stroke in 15%). Systemic features include thrombocytopenia (20%), hemolytic anemia (5%), and valvular heart disease (Libman-Sacks endocarditis in 10%). Severity is graded by Sydney criteria: single positive antibody with one clinical event is mild; triple positivity with recurrent thrombosis or obstetric morbidity is severe. Without treatment, cumulative risk of a new thrombotic event is 8\u201317% per year.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion in any patient with \u22652 miscarriages, thrombosis, or livedo reticularis. Step 2: Order antiphospholipid panel including lupus anticoagulant (dRVVT with 95% sensitivity, 88% specificity), anti-cardiolipin IgG/IgM (ELISA cut-off >40 GPL or MPL; sensitivity 70%, specificity 90%), and anti-\u03b22GPI IgG/IgM (>99th percentile). Step 3: Repeat tests at least 12 weeks apart to confirm persistence. First-line imaging: Doppler ultrasound if DVT suspected (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%), transcranial Doppler for right-to-left shunt. MRI brain with T2-FLAIR demonstrates small subcortical infarcts. Step 4: Exclude other coagulopathies: perform PT/INR (normal 0.9\u20131.1), aPTT (normal 25\u201335 sec). If PTT prolonged, mix with normal plasma to distinguish factor deficiency from inhibitor. Second-line: Complement levels (C3/C4), ANA panel if SLE is suspected. CSF analysis is usually normal; cell count <5 cells/mm\u00b3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL. Electrophysiology is not diagnostic but may reveal post-stroke evoked potential delays. Differential diagnoses include thrombophilia (Factor V Leiden), TTP (ADAMTS13 activity <10%), SLE vasculitis (anti-dsDNA titers). Distinguishing features: APS has positive antibody titers plus clinical criteria.","management_principles":"First-line therapy in APS with thrombotic events includes long-term warfarin (target INR 2.0\u20133.0) with an initial loading dose of 5\u201310 mg daily for 2 days, then adjust by INR. In obstetric APS without thrombosis, low-dose aspirin (75\u2013100 mg daily) plus prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 40 mg s.c. daily) from confirmation of pregnancy until 6 weeks postpartum reduces miscarriage by 50%. Severe or recurrent cases with arterial thrombosis or triple positivity benefit from INR target 3.0\u20134.0. In warfarin-refractory patients, rivaroxaban 20 mg daily has been trialed but remains controversial. Hydroxychloroquine 200\u2013400 mg daily may reduce antibody titers and flares, especially in SLE overlap. Avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives. For catastrophic APS, protocol includes IV heparin (80 units/kg bolus, then 18 units/kg/h infusion), corticosteroids (1 g methylprednisolone daily \u00d73 days), plasma exchange daily \u00d75 days, and IVIG 0.4 g/kg daily. Monitor CBC, INR, anti\u2013Xa activity in pregnancy. Second-line immunosuppressants (e.g., rituximab 375 mg/m^2 weekly) are reserved for refractory cases. Non-pharmacological measures: compression stockings, smoking cessation, weight control, with evidence showing 30% reduction in recurrence.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule clinical assessments every 3 months initially, then biannually if stable. Monitor INR monthly for warfarin, aiming for 2.0\u20133.0 in venous APS or 3.0\u20134.0 in arterial disease. In obstetric cases, perform obstetric ultrasounds at 12, 20, and 28 weeks to assess fetal growth and placental flow. Check CBC, liver and renal function every 4\u20136 weeks. Annual echocardiography to evaluate valvular lesions or Libman\u2013Sacks vegetations. Repeat antiphospholipid antibody panel every 12 months; titers >99th percentile correlate with recurrence risk of 20% at one year. Long-term complications include chronic kidney disease (incidence 5\u201310%), pulmonary hypertension (5%), and cognitive impairment (15%). Rehabilitation for stroke survivors should commence within 48 hours, with tailored physical and occupational therapy for 3\u20136 months. Educate patients on bleeding signs, adherence, and avoiding immobilization. Advise driving restrictions for 6 months post-stroke. Provide resources like the Antiphospholipid Syndrome Foundation and local support groups for psychosocial support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Recurrent early miscarriage (\u22652) plus livedo reticularis should raise APS suspicion immediately. 2. Lupus anticoagulant prolongs PTT yet paradoxically increases thrombosis risk; always perform confirmatory mixing studies. 3. Triple positivity (LA + anti-cardiolipin + anti-\u03b22GPI) carries highest thrombotic risk (50% at 5 years). 4. In obstetric APS, aspirin plus LMWH reduces fetal loss from 90% to 20%. 5. Warfarin is teratogenic; switch to LMWH in pregnancy. 6. Memory aid: \u201cSOAP BRAIN MD\u201d mnemonic for SLE vs APS overlap. 7. Avoid DOACs in APS with arterial events per 2020 EULAR guidance. 8.
