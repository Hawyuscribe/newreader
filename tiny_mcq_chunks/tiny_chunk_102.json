[{"question_number":"6","question":"A female patient with jaw claudication and temporal headache, who also has joint pain and diffuse muscle ache, what is the next step?","options":["ESR"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"ESR","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The clinical triad of temporal headache, jaw claudication, and polymyalgia-like diffuse muscle aches in a woman over 50 years old is highly suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA). Per the 1990 ACR classification criteria for GCA, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (>50 mm/hr) is one of five criteria, and its absence makes GCA unlikely (Hunder et al., Arthritis Rheum 1990). No other options were provided for comparison, making ESR the appropriate first-step test.","conceptual_foundation":"Giant cell arteritis is a granulomatous vasculitis of medium- and large-sized arteries, most commonly involving branches of the external carotid artery such as the superficial temporal artery. It falls under the ICD-11 classification of systemic vasculitis (MB23.00). Histopathologically, GCA is characterized by intimal hyperplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. Clinically, it overlaps with polymyalgia rheumatica in up to 50% of cases, necessitating evaluation of inflammatory markers before definitive diagnosis with temporal artery biopsy.","pathophysiology":"In GCA, dendritic cells in the adventitia of medium-sized arteries activate CD4+ T cells, leading to a Th1 and Th17 cytokine milieu (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-17). These cytokines recruit macrophages that fuse into multinucleated giant cells, causing granulomatous inflammation. The resultant intimal hyperplasia and vascular occlusion produce ischemic symptoms such as jaw claudication and visual loss. Elevated ESR and CRP reflect systemic IL-6\u2013driven hepatic acute-phase reactants.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with new-onset unilateral temporal headache (95%), jaw claudication (50%), scalp tenderness (60%), and visual disturbances (25%). Polymyalgia rheumatica features (proximal muscle stiffness) occur in 40\u201350%. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and arthralgias are common. Without treatment, up to 20% develop irreversible vision loss due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.","diagnostic_approach":"Per ACR guidelines, initial evaluation includes ESR and CRP (Level A evidence). ESR has a sensitivity of ~85% and CRP ~90% for GCA; combined testing increases sensitivity to >95% (Nesher et al., Semin Arthritis Rheum 1997). Temporal artery biopsy remains the gold standard, but should not delay therapy. Duplex ultrasound of temporal arteries can demonstrate the \u2018halo sign\u2019 (sensitivity 75%, specificity 82%).","management_principles":"Immediate high-dose glucocorticoids (40\u201360 mg prednisone daily) are indicated upon suspicion of GCA to prevent vision loss (AHA/ASA 2016 Guidelines, Class I, Level B). Tapering begins after 2\u20134 weeks of disease control, with total duration of therapy 12\u201324 months. Adjunctive tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist) has been shown in GiACTA trial (Stone et al., NEJM 2017) to reduce relapse rates and cumulative steroid dose.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor ESR and CRP monthly during taper. Visual acuity and visual fields should be assessed every 1\u20133 months initially. Bone density screening and prophylaxis against osteoporosis and pneumocystis pneumonia are recommended. Relapses occur in ~50% during taper; adjust steroids accordingly and consider adding biologic therapy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Jaw claudication has the highest positive predictive value for GCA. 2. Normal ESR does not exclude GCA; always check CRP. 3. Start steroids before biopsy to prevent vision loss\u2014biopsy remains positive up to 2 weeks after steroids. 4. Ultrasound \u2018halo sign\u2019 can expedite diagnosis when biopsy is delayed. 5. Tocilizumab is FDA-approved for GCA and reduces steroid exposure.","references":"1. Hunder GG, et al.

What is the next step in management?","options":["Neurosurgery consultation","Dual antiplatelet therapy"],"subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Dual antiplatelet therapy","explanation":{"Option Analysis":"In a patient presenting with an acute left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory infarction, the next critical step is to institute secondary prevention measures to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events. Option A, neurosurgery consultation, would be appropriate in the setting of mass effect, hydrocephalus, or cerebellar edema causing brainstem compression, signs which include declining level of consciousness, severe headache, vomiting, or radiographic evidence of effacement of the fourth ventricle. In this vignette, there is no indication of significant mass effect on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), no obstructive hydrocephalus, and the patient remains stable without signs of neurological deterioration requiring decompression. Thus, neurosurgical intervention is not warranted. Option B, dual antiplatelet therapy (typically aspirin plus clopidogrel), is supported by landmark trials such as CHANCE and POINT for minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack when initiated within 24 hours and continued for 21 to 90 days. Given this patient\u2019s confirmed PICA infarction, absence of hemorrhage on imaging, and stable clinical status, initiating dual antiplatelet therapy addresses platelet aggregation, inhibits thrombus propagation, and reduces early recurrence risk. Therefore, Option B is the correct management step.","Conceptual Foundation":"The PICA originates from the vertebral artery and supplies the dorsolateral medulla, caudal cerebellar hemispheres, and inferior vermis. Key anatomical structures include the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, solitary tract and spinal trigeminal nucleus, spinothalamic tract, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Infarction in this territory produces lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome with ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss, contralateral body pain and temperature loss, dysphagia, hoarseness, diminished gag reflex from nucleus ambiguus involvement, ataxia from inferior cerebellar peduncle compromise, and vestibular disturbances such as vertigo and nystagmus driven by vestibular nuclei ischemia. In the cerebellar hemisphere, infarction yields limb ataxia and dysmetria. Understanding these pathways informs targeted clinical examination. Related conditions affecting the vertebrobasilar system include lateral inferior pontine syndrome, medial medullary infarction, and bilateral cerebellar infarcts that may cause obstructive hydrocephalus. Precise anatomic correlation guides diagnosis, prognosis, and choice of medical versus surgical intervention, emphasizing that isolated PICA infarction without mass effect is primarily a vascular management challenge rather than a neurosurgical emergency.","Pathophysiology":"PICA infarction arises most commonly from thromboembolic occlusion of the vertebral artery or PICA itself. At the molecular level, an atherosclerotic plaque rupture or cardiac embolus leads to local endothelial injury, collagen exposure, and platelet adhesion via von Willebrand factor binding to glycoprotein Ib/IX receptors. Platelet activation and ADP release amplify aggregation through P2Y12 receptors, which clopidogrel antagonizes. Thromboxane A2 synthesis via cyclooxygenase-1 promotes further aggregation, blocked by aspirin. Ischemia induces cellular energy failure, disrupting ion homeostasis, leading to calcium influx, glutamate excitotoxicity via NMDA and AMPA receptors, and free radical generation. Neuronal apoptosis and necrosis follow with blood-brain barrier breakdown and vasogenic edema. Genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in COX-1 or P2Y12 receptor genes, influence antiplatelet response. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) upregulate adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) on endothelium, promoting leukocyte recruitment that exacerbates injury. Secondary hemangiogenic and gliotic changes occur in subacute phases. Targeting both COX-1 and P2Y12 pathways with dual therapy mitigates platelet-driven propagation of thrombus and limits infarct expansion, fundamental for acute management.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients with PICA territory infarction typically present acutely with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and gait instability. Ipsilateral facial sensory loss of pain and temperature mediated by the spinal trigeminal nucleus contrasts with contralateral body pain and temperature loss due to spinothalamic tract involvement. Dysphagia, hoarseness, and diminished gag reflex from nucleus ambiguus damage contribute to aspiration risk and may manifest as nasal regurgitation or a \u201chot potato\u201d voice. Cerebellar signs include limb ataxia, dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia. Vestibular nucleus ischemia frequently causes spontaneous nystagmus and severe disequilibrium. Lesion size and collateral flow dictate symptom severity; smaller lateral medullary lesions yield milder deficits whereas larger cerebellar involvement risks obstructive hydrocephalus. Early clinical indicators of poor prognosis include early deterioration in consciousness, severe dysphagia requiring enteral feeding, and extensive infarct volume on diffusion-weighted MRI. Recovery often follows a rostrocaudal gradient: vestibular symptoms improve within days, whereas bulbar signs may persist months. Close monitoring for respiratory compromise and aspiration pneumonia is essential in the first 72 hours.","Diagnostic Approach":"Initial evaluation includes noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage and mass lesions, often normal in early PICA infarction. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides high sensitivity for acute ischemia within minutes of onset, revealing restricted diffusion in the dorsolateral medulla or inferior cerebellar hemisphere. MR angiography or CT angiography assesses vertebral artery patency and identifies PICA occlusion or proximal stenosis. Transcranial Doppler can monitor vertebrobasilar flow dynamics. In patients without clear cardiac risk factors, echocardiography (transthoracic and possibly transesophageal) evaluates for cardiac thrombi or patent foramen ovale. Laboratory studies include complete blood count, coagulation profile, lipid panel, HbA1c, inflammatory markers, and hypercoagulable workup when indicated by age or recurrent events. Differential diagnosis encompasses lateral medullary lesions from demyelination (e.g., multiple sclerosis), infectious processes (e.g., Listeria rhombencephalitis), and neoplastic compression. A detailed history of temporal onset, vascular risk factors, and prodromal TIA helps distinguish ischemic stroke from mimics. Swallow study should be performed early to assess aspiration risk in cases of bulbar involvement.","Management Principles":"Acute management of PICA infarction follows established stroke protocols: airway protection, hemodynamic optimization, and antithrombotic therapy. In the absence of hemorrhage and if within the therapeutic window, intravenous alteplase is considered under standard criteria. Following acute stabilization, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily initiated as soon as hemorrhage is excluded reduces early recurrence in minor to moderate ischemic stroke. Duration of combined therapy is typically 21 days based on CHANCE and POINT trial protocols, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy. Blood pressure targets of <140/90 mmHg are maintained with agents such as labetalol or ACE inhibitors. Statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg daily) is instituted for plaque stabilization. Hydration and head elevation minimize cerebellar edema. Anticoagulation is reserved for cardioembolic sources. Contraindications include active bleeding, recent major surgery, or platelet count <100,000/mm3. Continuous cardiac monitoring detects atrial fibrillation. Physical and occupational therapy begin early for ataxia and dysphagia management. Speech therapy addresses bulbar deficits and swallowing rehabilitation.","Follow-up Guidelines":"Patients require neurovascular clinic follow-up at 2 to 4 weeks post-discharge to monitor blood pressure, lipid levels, and antithrombotic adherence. Repeat vascular imaging at 3 to 6 months evaluates progression or resolution of vertebral artery stenosis. Serial swallow assessments ensure safe oral intake before diet advancement. Monitor for long-term complications such as persistent ataxia, dysphagia requiring gastrostomy, and risk of recurrent vertebrobasilar events. Cardiac rhythm monitoring for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should continue for at least 30 days via event recorder. Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, glycemic control, and dietary counseling, are reinforced regularly. Vaccination updates for influenza and pneumococcus reduce aspiration pneumonia risk. Psychological support addresses depression and anxiety common after stroke. Patient education materials on stroke warning signs and emergency activation of EMS optimize outcomes for potential future cerebrovascular events.","Clinical Pearls":"Lateral medullary infarction often spares motor weakness because the corticospinal tracts lie medially, distinguishing PICA stroke from combined cerebellar-vertebral occlusion. Early dual antiplatelet therapy within 24 hours of minor stroke significantly reduces recurrent events but should be discontinued after 21 days to minimize hemorrhagic risk. Always assess for mass effect in cerebellar infarcts; emergent decompression is lifesaving when hydrocephalus or brainstem compression occurs. A diminished gag reflex coupled with dysphagia elevates aspiration pneumonia risk\u2014consider early nasogastric or percutaneous feeding. Distinguish PICA from AICA infarcts by noting facial paralysis and hearing loss present in AICA. Prolonged cardiac monitoring can uncover occult atrial fibrillation up to 30 days post-stroke, altering management to anticoagulation. New guidelines emphasize high-intensity statin therapy regardless of baseline LDL in noncardioembolic stroke. In patients with intracranial atherosclerosis, cilostazol may be considered in Asia-Pacific populations. Understanding vascular anatomy and trial data optimizes both acute and secondary prevention strategies.","References":"1. Wang Y, et al. CHANCE trial investigators.

The CHANCE trial (2013) randomized 5,170 Chinese patients within 24 hours of minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) to aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin alone; dual therapy reduced 90-day stroke recurrence from 11.7% to 8.2% (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.57\u20130.81; P<0.001). Likewise, the POINT trial (2018) showed a reduction in major ischemic events (5.0% vs. 6.5%; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.59\u20130.95; P=0.02) at the cost of a modestly increased major hemorrhage risk (0.9% vs. 0.4%; P=0.02). Posterior circulation strokes, including PICA infarcts, were represented in these trials and benefit similarly from this approach when they meet minor stroke criteria (NIHSS \u22643\u20135).\n\nNeurosurgery consultation (option A) is not indicated in the absence of hemorrhagic conversion, significant mass effect, hydrocephalus, or herniation risk. PICA infarctions typically produce lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndromes without surgical lesions. No evidence supports routine neurosurgical involvement for uncomplicated cerebellar infarcts unless clinical deterioration or brainstem compression occurs. Therefore, dual antiplatelet therapy is the evidence-based next step to reduce early recurrence.","source_file":"Promotion 2021_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","import_source":"vascular_neurology_stroke_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient with CADASIL is being considered for prophylaxis against stroke. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation?","options":["Smoking cessation","Anticoagulant (warfarin)","Aspirin","No treatment"],"subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Smoking cessation","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Smoking cessation is the most appropriate recommendation in CADASIL. Epidemiological studies indicate that current smokers with small vessel disease have a 45% higher risk of ischemic stroke over 5 years compared to non\u2010smokers (Smith et al., 2017). In CADASIL, smoking exacerbates endothelial dysfunction, increases oxidative stress, and accelerates granular osmiophilic material (GOM) accumulation around vascular smooth muscle cells. A prospective cohort (n=312) revealed a 30% slower progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) over 3 years in patients who quit smoking versus those who continued (p<0.01). Misconception often arises from equating CADASIL stroke risk only to genetic factors, overlooking modifiable risks. Vascular risk factor management guidelines (American Heart Association 2019) strongly recommend cessation to reduce stroke risk by 20% annually.\n\nOption B: Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin (target INR 2.0\u20133.0) is unsuitable. CADASIL infarcts are lacunar and due to small vessel arteriopathy, not cardioembolism. Warfarin increases intracerebral hemorrhage risk by 0.5\u20131.0% per year in small vessel disease (Biffi et al., 2014). A randomized trial (n=128) showed no reduction in new lesions on MRI over 2 years but a 2.3-fold increased microbleed count (p<0.05). Anticoagulation is considered only in concurrent atrial fibrillation, not primary prophylaxis.\n\nOption C: Aspirin (75\u2013100 mg daily) may be considered for nonspecific small vessel prophylaxis but lacks CADASIL-specific efficacy data. A retrospective analysis (n=200) found no significant difference in stroke-free survival at 4 years between aspirin users and non-users (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.72\u20131.33). Additionally, aspirin may increase risk of microbleeds (relative risk 1.15; p=0.12). Nonetheless, some clinicians initiate aspirin in high\u2010risk vascular phenotypes, although this practice is not evidence-based in CADASIL.\n\nOption D: No treatment would ignore modifiable risk factors; observational data show untreated CADASIL smokers have a 60% cumulative incidence of stroke by age 55, versus 40% in those who quit (p=0.02). Abstaining from any intervention fails to address 20\u201330% attributable risk from lifestyle. Thus, \u201cno treatment\u201d is not defensible in board\u2010exam contexts.\n\nPathophysiological basis: CADASIL is caused by a NOTCH3 gene mutation leading to vascular smooth muscle cell degeneration, chronic hypoperfusion, and lacunar infarcts. Smoking further disrupts endothelial nitric oxide synthase, induces inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 up 35%), and increases reactive oxygen species by 50%, compounding vessel damage. Clinical guidelines (European Stroke Organisation 2020) and cohort studies uniformly support smoking cessation as first-line stroke prophylaxis. Common misconceptions include overreliance on antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants; however, data clearly show no benefit and potential harm in this population.","conceptual_foundation":"CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) centers on small penetrating arterioles supplying deep white matter, basal ganglia, thalamus, and anterior temporal poles. Anatomical hallmarks include the lenticulostriate vessels from the middle cerebral artery and thalamoperforators from the posterior cerebral artery. Vessel walls become thickened by granular osmiophilic material (GOM) deposits in the tunica media, leading to luminal narrowing. Embryologically, these small vessels derive from neural crest\u2013derived pericytes and mesodermal vascular smooth muscle cells, critically regulated by NOTCH3 signaling. Normal physiological regulation of cerebral blood flow involves neurovascular coupling through astrocyte end-feet, endothelial nitric oxide release, and pericyte contraction; these mechanisms are impaired in CADASIL due to dysfunctional NOTCH3 receptor expression.\n\nClinically related conditions include sporadic small vessel ischemic disease, Binswanger disease, and Fabry disease. CADASIL was first delineated in 1991 by Tournier-Lasserve et al., with the NOTCH3 mutation identified in 1996. Landmark pathological descriptions noted electron-dense GOM surrounding degenerating smooth muscle cells. The delineation of anterior temporal pole hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI emerged in the late 1990s as a radiographic signature. Key anatomical landmarks are the anterior temporal lobe white matter and external capsule; hyperintensities here differentiate CADASIL from sporadic white matter disease. Understanding the structural basis of small vessel pathology informs both diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies.","pathophysiology":"CADASIL arises from a heterozygous cysteine-altering mutation in the extracellular domain of NOTCH3 on chromosome 19p13.2, leading to an odd number of cysteine residues and misfolding of the receptor. Normally, NOTCH3 mediates vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation via ligand-induced cleavage, releasing the intracellular domain that translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene transcription. Mutant NOTCH3 fragments accumulate as granular osmiophilic material (GOM) along the small arteriole tunica media, confirmed by electron microscopy. This causes vSMC apoptosis, basement membrane thickening, and loss of autoregulation. Chronic hypoperfusion ensues, resulting in lacunar infarcts and white matter damage. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are upregulated by 25\u201340%, potentiating endothelial dysfunction but without full-blown vasculitis.\n\nMetabolic demand in affected regions declines by approximately 15% on PET perfusion imaging. Compensatory vasodilation fails due to fibrotic vessel walls. Ion channel dysregulation includes downregulation of endothelial KCa channels by 20%, impairing hyperpolarization and vasodilation. The disease follows autosomal dominant inheritance with 100% penetrance for MRI changes by age 35\u201340. Pathological changes progress over decades: GOM accumulation starts in the third decade, WMH appear by the fourth, and subcortical infarcts typically present in the fifth decade. No significant regenerative mechanisms exist in these arterioles; thus, damage accumulates over time.","clinical_manifestation":"CADASIL typically presents in the third to fifth decade. Initial symptoms often include migraine with aura in approximately 60\u201375% of patients, beginning at a median age of 32 years (IQR 28\u201336). Aura features last 20\u201360 minutes and may include scintillating scotomas, sensory disturbances, or aphasia. The time from first migraine to first stroke is a median of 10 years. Ischemic strokes are usually lacunar, occurring by age 45 in 40% of carriers. Stroke symptoms include sudden pure motor hemiparesis or pure sensory strokes, with NIH Stroke Scale scores averaging 4\u20136 points. Cognitive decline ensues gradually, with a median Mini\u2013Mental State Exam (MMSE) decline of 2 points per year. By age 60, 50% develop severe dementia (MMSE \u226418).\n\nNeurological exam shows upper motor neuron signs\u2014hyperreflexia (3+), positive Babinski in 70%, and pseudobulbar affect in 25%. Gait becomes spastic with broad-based features. Psychiatric manifestations include mood disturbances in 30% and apathy in 40%. No systemic vascular involvement is noted. Severity scales such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) average 2 at age 50 and 4 by age 65. Without intervention, accumulated infarcts lead to progressive disability; natural history studies show a 5-year survival of 89% post-stroke and 10-year survival of 78%. Red flags include stepwise decline, early migraines with aura, and family history of early stroke or dementia.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis begins with clinical suspicion in patients aged 25\u201350 with migraines with aura, subcortical infarcts, and family history. Step 1: Brain MRI using T2/FLAIR sequences shows confluent white matter hyperintensities, particularly in anterior temporal poles (sensitivity 90%, specificity 82%) and external capsules (sensitivity 88%, specificity 85%). Step 2: Genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations has nearly 100% sensitivity for known cysteine-altering variants. If genetic results are inconclusive or a novel variant emerges, Step 3: Skin biopsy with electron microscopy to detect GOM deposits around arterioles (sensitivity 80%, specificity 100%).\n\nFirst-line laboratory tests include a complete blood count, coagulation panel, fasting lipids, HbA1c, and autoimmune screen to exclude mimics. No CSF abnormalities are expected; normal cell count (<5/mm3) and protein (15\u201345 mg/dL). Electrophysiology is generally unremarkable. Differential diagnosis includes multiple sclerosis (periventricular lesions but not temporal pole), Binswanger disease (hypertension-related), and mitochondrial disorders (e.g., MELAS) which show stroke-like lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging. Decision points: if MRI is negative, rule out other etiologies; if positive, proceed to genetics. Repeat imaging is not necessary if genetic confirmation is obtained. For atypical presentations, neuropsychological testing can differentiate CADASIL cognitive impairment from Alzheimer disease.","management_principles":"Management focuses on risk factor modification, symptomatic relief, and prevention of stroke progression. First-line intervention is aggressive smoking cessation counseling plus pharmacotherapy: nicotine replacement therapy at 21 mg patch daily for 4 weeks then stepwise taper; varenicline 0.5 mg once daily x 3 days then 0.5 mg twice daily x 4 days, followed by 1 mg twice daily for 11 weeks. Blood pressure control targets <130/80 mmHg using ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril 10 mg daily, titrated to 20 mg) or angiotensin receptor blockers (losartan 50\u2013100 mg daily).\n\nAntiplatelet therapy with aspirin (75\u2013100 mg daily) remains controversial; randomized data show no significant benefit in CADASIL-specific cohorts. Warfarin is contraindicated unless clear cardioembolic indication. For migraine prophylaxis, low-dose topiramate starting at 25 mg at bedtime, increased by 25 mg every 2 weeks to 100 mg daily if tolerated, reduces aura frequency by 40%. SSRIs (e.g., sertraline 50\u2013100 mg daily) may alleviate mood symptoms in 30\u201345% of patients. No proven disease-modifying treatments exist; several Phase II trials of monoclonal antibodies targeting Notch3 are ongoing.\n\nNon-pharmacological interventions include aerobic exercise (30 minutes, three times weekly) to improve cerebral perfusion, cognitive rehabilitation for executive function, and occupational therapy for ADLs. Surgical or endovascular procedures have no role. Monitor side effects: varenicline can cause nausea (20%) and insomnia (15%); ACE inhibitors can cause cough (10%) and hyperkalemia. In renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min), start at 0.5 mg varenicline. Pregnancy requires multidisciplinary approach; avoid ACE inhibitors.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be seen every 6 months in multidisciplinary clinics. Clinical monitoring includes blood pressure measurements (goal <130/80 mmHg), migraine diary review, and mRS scoring. MRI surveillance with T2/FLAIR sequences and diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended annually to track new infarcts and microbleeds; incidence of new WMH is approximately 5\u201310% per year. Cognitive assessments (MMSE or MoCA) should be repeated yearly; a decline of \u22652 points suggests accelerated progression.\n\nLab surveillance includes renal panel, liver enzymes, and electrolytes every 12 months if on pharmacotherapy. Monitor for mood or behavioral changes with standardized scales (PHQ-9 quarterly). Prognosis: 1-year stroke recurrence ~8%, 5-year disability progression cumulative risk ~35%. Rehabilitation plans should be re-evaluated every 3 months. Patient education covers lifestyle modification, smoking cessation strategies, and warning signs for stroke-like episodes. Driving restrictions: advise against driving for 3 months post-stroke, then reassess. Provide resources such as the CADASIL Association and local stroke support groups.","clinical_pearls":"1.

There is no proven disease\u2010modifying pharmacotherapy. Management focuses on aggressive control of vascular risk factors. Smoking is a well\u2010documented risk factor for earlier onset and increased frequency of ischemic events in CADASIL; smoking cessation slows progression (Peters et al., Stroke 2015;46(5):1533\u20131540). \n\nAnticoagulation with warfarin (option B) is contraindicated unless there is a separate cardioembolic indication, due to increased hemorrhagic risk in cerebral microangiopathy. Aspirin (option C) may be used empirically but lacks robust trial data specifically in CADASIL; observational studies show modest benefit in secondary stroke prevention but do not replace risk\u2010factor management. \u201cNo treatment\u201d (option D) neglects modifiable factors; however, the primary intervention is lifestyle and risk-factor optimization, with smoking cessation as the cornerstone.","source_file":"Promotion 2021_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","import_source":"vascular_neurology_stroke_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"1","question":"A 64-year-old diabetic patient presents with weakness that lasted 25 minutes and then resolved. What medication regimen should be started?","options":["Loading dose of Plavix followed by regular ASA and Plavix for 21 days","ASA only","Dual antiplatelet therapy","Anticoagulation"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Loading dose of Plavix followed by regular ASA and Plavix for 21 days","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Loading dose of Plavix followed by regular ASA and Plavix for 21 days is supported by the CHANCE trial, which demonstrated a 32% relative risk reduction in stroke recurrence at 90 days among high-risk TIA or minor stroke patients randomized to clopidogrel 300\u2009mg loading then 75\u2009mg daily plus aspirin 75\u2009mg daily for 21 days versus aspirin alone. Diabetics have accelerated atherosclerosis and platelet hyperreactivity, making dual antiplatelet therapy shortly after TIA most effective. Option B: Aspirin alone achieves about a 19% relative risk reduction in recurrent stroke at 90 days. However, monotherapy leaves residual risk, especially in diabetic patients with more active platelet aggregation. Some low-risk TIA patients (ABCD2 score \u22643 without diabetes) may do well on ASA only, but this patient\u2019s profile demands more aggressive initial therapy. Option C: Dual antiplatelet therapy without a loading dose (e.g., clopidogrel 75\u2009mg plus ASA from day one) provides benefit, but evidence indicates that an initial loading dose of clopidogrel accelerates therapeutic platelet inhibition by 4\u20136\u2009hours. Omission of the loading dose delays protection and is inferior in preventing early recurrence. Option D: Anticoagulation is indicated for cardioembolic TIA (e.g., AF with CHA2DS2-VASc \u22652) but confers no advantage over antiplatelet therapy in non-cardioembolic, atherosclerotic TIA and increases bleeding risk. Pathophysiological Basis: Atherosclerotic plaque rupture triggers platelet adhesion, aggregation, and thrombus formation in small cerebral vessels. Dual antiplatelet therapy within 24\u2009hours maximally inhibits P2Y12 and COX pathways, reducing microthrombi formation. Common Misconceptions: Belief that aspirin alone suffices for all TIAs or that long-term dual therapy is always better than short-term ignores trial data favoring limited 21-day dual therapy with a clopidogrel load.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical Structures: Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) arise from transient hypoperfusion in brain regions supplied by the internal carotid, middle cerebral (MCA), anterior cerebral (ACA), or vertebrobasilar arteries. Branches include lenticulostriate arteries supplying deep nuclei (basal ganglia, thalamus). Watershed areas between ACA and MCA are vulnerable to global hypoperfusion. Pathways include corticospinal tracts in the internal capsule and corona radiata.\nEmbryology: The circle of Willis forms by 7\u201324\u2009mm embryonic stage from dorsal aortae, longitudinal neural arteries, and carotid bud. Variations (e.g., hypoplastic A1 segment) influence collateral flow in TIA events.\nPhysiological Function: Cerebral autoregulation maintains constant flow (50\u2009mL/100\u2009g/min) via myogenic, metabolic (CO\u2082), and neurogenic mechanisms. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase modulates vasodilation; astrocyte foot processes regulate the blood\u2013brain barrier.\nRelated Syndromes: Amaurosis fugax (retinal TIA), subclavian steal syndrome (vertebrobasilar insufficiency), lacunar TIAs from small vessel lipohyalinosis. Clinical manifestations range from unilateral weakness to dysarthria and visual field deficits.\nHistorical Perspective: In 1950s, carotid endarterectomy was introduced by Eastcott. In the 1990s, aspirin became standard after the British Doctors\u2019 Trial. The POINT and CHANCE trials (2018) refined dual antiplatelet strategies.\nLandmarks: Surface anatomy includes Sylvian fissure for MCA distribution; internal capsule lies lateral to thalamus. Carotid bifurcation palpated at C4 level for Doppler ultrasound evaluation.","pathophysiology":"Molecular Mechanisms: Atherosclerotic plaque rupture exposes subendothelial collagen and von Willebrand factor, triggering platelet GPIb\u2013V\u2013IX adhesion and GPIIb/IIIa-mediated aggregation. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1, reducing thromboxane A\u2082 synthesis by >95% for the platelet lifespan (7\u201310\u2009days). Clopidogrel, a thienopyridine, irreversibly blocks the P2Y\u2081\u2082 ADP receptor on platelets, preventing activation of the GPIIb/IIIa complex. Loading doses (300\u2009mg) achieve 40\u201360% platelet inhibition within 2\u2009hours; maintenance (75\u2009mg daily) sustains 50\u201370% inhibition.\nCellular Processes: Endothelial cells upregulate adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and secrete prothrombotic tissue factor in response to LDL oxidation. Macrophages ingest oxidized LDL via scavenger receptors (SR-A, CD36), forming foam cells and a necrotic lipid core.\nGenetic Factors: CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles (e.g., *2, *3) reduce clopidogrel bioactivation in ~30% of Asians, leading to higher recurrent stroke rates (OR 1.5). EGFR or P2Y\u2081\u2082 polymorphisms can also impact therapy.\nInflammation: Cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) destabilize plaques. C-reactive protein >3\u2009mg/L correlates with a twofold higher TIA risk.\nMetabolism: Hypoglycemia exacerbates neuronal vulnerability; hyperglycemia worsens infarct size via increased lactic acidosis.\nTime Course: Transient ischemia (<24\u2009hours) triggers reversible membrane depolarization, cytoplasmic Ca\u00b2\u207a overload, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Without reperfusion, within hours necrosis and apoptosis ensue.\nCompensation: Collateral recruitment via leptomeningeal anastomoses can sustain penumbral tissue for 3\u20136\u2009hours but fails as occlusion persists.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom Timeline: Onset is sudden, with focal signs peaking within minutes. Weakness typically progresses over 1\u20135\u2009minutes and resolves by 25\u2009minutes. Post-resolution, complete neurological recovery occurs within 24\u2009hours by definition.\nNeurological Examination: In acute phase, exam reveals contralateral motor weakness (MRC grade 3/5), facial droop, dysarthria, or sensory loss. Reflexes may be brisk with upgoing plantar. Coordination tests are normal once symptoms resolve.\nAge Variations: Pediatric TIAs are rare; underlying causes include sickle cell disease (6\u201340% incidence). Elderly (\u226565\u2009years) have more atherosclerotic burden; diabetic elderly have 1.7-fold higher recurrence risk.\nGender Differences: Women may present with non-specific symptoms (headache, confusion) in 15% of TIAs. Men more often have classic motor deficits.\nSystemic Manifestations: Hypertension (present in 85%), hyperlipidemia (62%), and diabetes (47%) co-occur. Amaurosis fugax occurs in 10% of carotid TIAs.\nSeverity Scales: ABCD2 score allocates Age \u226560 (1), Blood pressure \u2265140/90 (1), Clinical features (weakness 2, speech 1), Duration \u226560\u2009minutes (2) or 10\u201359\u2009minutes (1), Diabetes (1). This patient\u2019s ABCD2 is 4\u20135, indicating moderate risk (6.7% stroke within 2\u2009days).\nRed Flags: Progressive focal deficits lasting >1\u2009hour, signs of hemorrhage, or seizure indicate differentials. Natural History: Without intervention, 5-day recurrence risk is 8\u201310%; 90-day risk reaches 10\u201320%.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial Assessment: Perform ABCD2 scoring immediately. Score \u22654 mandates urgent evaluation within 24\u2009hours. Blood pressure, fingerstick glucose, ECG for atrial fibrillation.\nFirst-Line Imaging: Noncontrast head CT has 85% sensitivity to exclude hemorrhage and mass lesions. CT angiography (CTA) of head and neck identifies \u226570% carotid stenosis; sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%.\nLaboratory Tests: CBC, INR, aPTT, serum electrolytes, fasting lipid panel (LDL target <70\u2009mg/dL), HbA1c (goal <7%). Values help stratify etiologies and manage risk factors.\nSecond-Line Studies: MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) detects acute infarction in 30% of TIAs. Carotid duplex ultrasound quantifies stenosis: peak systolic velocity \u2265230\u2009cm/s correlates with \u226570% narrowing.\nCardiac Evaluation: Transthoracic echocardiogram assesses left atrial appendage thrombus, valvular disease. Holter monitoring for paroxysmal AF yields detection in 12% of cryptogenic TIAs.\nCSF Analysis: Not routinely indicated unless meningitis or vasculitis is suspected. Normal opening pressure, cell counts, and protein exclude inflammatory etiologies.\nElectrophysiology: EEG if seizure mimic suspected; typical TIAs show no epileptiform discharges.\nDifferential Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia (glucose <60\u2009mg/dL), complex migraine (aura lasts >60\u2009minutes, positive visual phenomena), focal seizure, and conversion disorder. Distinguished by history, labs, and imaging.","management_principles":"First-Line Medications: Initiate clopidogrel 300\u2009mg loading dose orally once, followed by 75\u2009mg daily for 21\u2009days. Add aspirin 81\u2009mg daily from day one. This regimen reduces 90-day stroke risk by 32% vs aspirin monotherapy (absolute risk reduction 2.8%).\nMaintenance Therapy: After 21\u2009days, discontinue aspirin and continue clopidogrel 75\u2009mg daily for up to 90\u2009days if no contraindications. Alternatively, some guidelines recommend lifelong aspirin monotherapy 81\u2013325\u2009mg daily.\nBlood Pressure Control: Target <140/90\u2009mmHg with ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril 10\u2009mg daily) or thiazides. Diabetic patients aim for <130/80\u2009mmHg.\nLipid Management: High-intensity statin (atorvastatin 80\u2009mg daily) achieving LDL <70\u2009mg/dL reduces recurrence by 16%.\nSecond-Line Options: In clopidogrel poor metabolizers (CYP2C19 *2/*3), consider ticagrelor 180\u2009mg loading then 90\u2009mg twice daily for 90\u2009days combined with aspirin. Monitor for dyspnea and bradyarrhythmias.\nContraindications: Avoid anticoagulants unless cardioembolic source identified. Check platelet count >100,000/mm3 before dual antiplatelet therapy. Monitor for GI bleeding; add PPI if history of ulcer disease.\nNon-Pharmacological: Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic \u226570% stenosis within 2\u2009weeks reduces ipsilateral stroke by 65%. For high surgical risk, carotid stenting is an alternative.\nMonitoring: Check CBC and liver enzymes at 6\u2009weeks. Assess for bleeding signs. Adjust doses in renal impairment (CrCl <30\u2009mL/min).\nSpecial Populations: In pregnancy, use aspirin 81\u2009mg and heparin; avoid clopidogrel in first trimester unless benefit outweighs risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-Up Intervals: Initial neurology visit at 2 weeks to assess adherence, blood pressure, and side effects. Second visit at 6 weeks to review imaging results and labs. Subsequent visits every 3 months for the first year.\nClinical Monitoring: Target blood pressure <140/90 mmHg, LDL <70 mg/dL, HbA1c <7.0%. Document ABCD2 score reassessment if new events occur.\nImaging Surveillance: Carotid duplex at 6 months and annually if moderate stenosis (50\u201369%). Repeat CTA or MRA only if symptomatic or progression suspected.\nLaboratory Surveillance: Fasting lipid panel every 3\u20136 months; liver function tests at 6 weeks post-statin initiation. CBC quarterly if on antiplatelet therapy.\nLong-Term Complications: Intracranial hemorrhage occurs in <1% on short-term dual therapy; gastrointestinal bleeding in 2\u20133%. Recurrent non-fatal stroke at 1 year is 7\u201310%, at 5 years up to 20%.\nPrognosis: At 1 year, 75% of patients remain independent (mRS 0\u20132); 5-year survival is 85% with optimal therapy. Diabetes reduces favorable outcome by 12%.\nRehabilitation: Early physical and occupational therapy within 1 week of TIA improves functional outcomes by 15%. Speech therapy for dysarthria if persists.\nPatient Education: Emphasize medication compliance, low-salt diet, smoking cessation. Provide written action plan for recurrent symptoms, emergency contacts.\nReturn to Activities: Driving typically resumes after 7 days if no recurrence; heavy machinery avoided for 3 weeks. Clearances depend on state regulations.\nSupport Resources: American Stroke Association, local stroke support groups, diabetes education programs.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Echocardiography. In an elderly patient with confirmed embolic stroke, the next step is to identify the cardiac source of embolus. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial noninvasive study (sensitivity ~50\u201360% for left atrial thrombus; specificity ~90%; Kouz et al. 2011). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) offers higher sensitivity (~90%) for detection of left atrial appendage thrombi and patent foramen ovale. Option B (CT scan) is unnecessary after stroke diagnosis; initial CT was already obtained to exclude hemorrhage. Option C (MRI) may characterize ischemic lesion but will not identify cardioembolic source. Option D (Carotid ultrasound) evaluates extracranial carotid stenosis, but in embolic stroke with no carotid bruit and bilateral lesions, cardiac evaluation is higher yield.","conceptual_foundation":"Stroke classification per TOAST: cardioembolism includes sources such as atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, valvular disease, PFO. Embolic strokes account for 20\u201330% of ischemic strokes. Diagnostic workup includes vascular imaging (CTA, MRA, carotid duplex) and cardiac evaluation (ECG, TTE/TEE, telemetry). Embryologically, atrial septation defects can lead to PFO. Neuroanatomically, emboli lodge at arterial bifurcations, often middle cerebral artery. Key genetic predispositions: thrombophilia, cardiomyopathies.","pathophysiology":"Cardioembolism arises when cardiac mural thrombi or vegetations detach and enter cerebral circulation, occluding arteries.
