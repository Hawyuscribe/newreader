[{"question_number":"4","question":"A young patient presented with weakness and cannot extend his elbow; he has toe walking, and ECG showed RBBB. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) presents in childhood or adolescence with early contractures (Achilles leading to toe walking, elbow contractures impairing extension), humeroperoneal muscle weakness, and cardiac conduction defects such as bundle branch blocks or complete heart block. The combination of toe walking, inability to extend the elbow, and ECG showing right bundle branch block is classic for EDMD. No other muscular dystrophy presents with this triad.","conceptual_foundation":"EDMD is an inherited myopathy due to mutations in nuclear envelope proteins: emerin (X-linked EDMD1) or lamins A/C (autosomal EDMD2). It is coded in ICD-11 under hereditary muscular dystrophy (MG30.1). Differential diagnoses include Duchenne (onset earlier, calf pseudohypertrophy, no contractures), limb-girdle (proximal weakness without early contractures or conduction defects), and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (facial involvement). Emerin interacts with the nuclear lamina to maintain nuclear integrity.","pathophysiology":"Mutations in EMD or LMNA disrupt nuclear envelope structure, leading to muscle fiber fragility and apoptosis, especially in mechanically stressed tissues (skeletal muscle and cardiac conduction system). Early fibrosis in tendon-muscle junctions causes contractures. Cardiac muscle involvement leads to conduction block due to fibrotic replacement of the conduction pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"EDMD typically presents before age 20 with Achilles tendon contractures (toe walking), elbow flexion contractures, and humeroperoneal weakness. Cardiac complications include conduction block, arrhythmias (RBBB, complete heart block), and dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to syncope or sudden death. Serum CK is mildly elevated (2\u20135\u00d7 ULN).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is by clinical triad, ECG (conduction block), EMG (myopathic pattern), genetic testing for EMD/LMNA mutations, and muscle biopsy showing fibrosis and nuclear envelope alterations. Cardiac MRI may assess fibrosis.","management_principles":"Physiotherapy to maintain range of motion, orthopedic surgery for severe contractures, and cardiac pacing for conduction defects are mainstays. Annual ECG and Holter monitoring guide pacemaker timing. Genetic counseling is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6 months with neuromuscular and cardiac evaluation. Annual echocardiography and ECG. Pacemaker or ICD placement as indicated by conduction delays or arrhythmias.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early elbows and Achilles contractures with humeroperoneal weakness suggest EDMD. 2. Cardiac conduction defects occur early, requiring yearly ECG. 3. X-linked form due to emerin deficiency; autosomal due to lamin A/C. 4. Mild CK elevation distinguishes from Duchenne. 5. Management focuses on contracture release and pacemaker insertion.","references":"1.

CT chest. An elderly patient with a subacute, distal sensorimotor neuropathy accompanied by weight loss and malaise raises suspicion for a paraneoplastic neuropathy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer. CT chest is the initial imaging modality to identify an occult thoracic malignancy. Option B (Anti-Hu) antibody testing may follow tumor screening. Option C (electrophoresis) screens for monoclonal gammopathies but neglects systemic signs of malignancy; electrophoresis is less urgent than chest imaging in this context.","conceptual_foundation":"Paraneoplastic neuropathies often precede cancer diagnosis by months. ICD-11 classifies these under G62.8 Other specified polyneuropathies. Differential diagnoses include diabetic neuropathy, paraproteinemic neuropathy, and vasculitic neuropathy. Anti-Hu antibodies are associated with small-cell lung cancer but have 40\u201350% sensitivity. CT chest provides high sensitivity (~85\u201390%) for lung masses.","pathophysiology":"Tumor cells express neural antigens (Hu proteins), triggering an immune response that cross-reacts with dorsal root ganglia neurons, causing neuronal apoptosis via CD8+ T lymphocytes and complement activation. This results in sensory ganglionopathy and distal axonal degeneration.","clinical_manifestation":"Paraneoplastic sensory-motor neuropathy presents with symmetric distal paresthesias, lancinating pain, and dorsiflexion weakness. Systemic signs include weight loss and malaise. Onset is subacute (weeks to months), distinguishing it from chronic degenerative neuropathies.","diagnostic_approach":"First tier: Basic labs (CBC, ESR, CRP), glucose, TSH, B12. Second tier: CT chest, abdomen, pelvis for malignancy screening. Electrophysiological studies confirm axonal sensorimotor neuropathy. Anti-Hu and other paraneoplastic antibodies have supportive value. Third tier: PET-CT if CT is nondiagnostic.","management_principles":"Primary: Treat underlying malignancy, as tumor control can stabilize or improve neuropathy. Immunotherapy (IVIG, plasmapheresis, steroids) may have limited benefit. Supportive care with neuropathic pain agents (gabapentin, duloxetine) and physiotherapy is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic symptoms monthly, repeat imaging every 3\u20136 months for tumor surveillance. NCS/EMG repeated if symptoms worsen. Assess quality of life and functional status regularly.","clinical_pearls":"1. Subacute distal sensorimotor neuropathy with systemic features should prompt malignancy screening first. 2. Anti-Hu antibodies are supportive but not sensitive; imaging is key. 3. Paraneoplastic neuropathy often stabilizes with tumor treatment. 4. Electrophoresis screens for monoclonal protein, but weight loss and malaise prioritize cancer search. 5. PET-CT may uncover occult malignancy when CT is negative.","references":"1. Graus F et al. Paraneoplastic Neurologic Syndromes.

After administering potassium, what is the next step in treatment?","options":["Daily potassium supplement","Acetazolamide","Dextrose infusion","Sodium bicarbonate"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Acetazolamide","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that prevents recurrent attacks of hypokalemic periodic paralysis by inducing a mild metabolic acidosis and promoting renal potassium retention. Option A (Daily potassium supplement) does not reliably prevent attacks and risks hyperkalemia during interictal periods. Option C (Dextrose infusion) is contraindicated because glucose stimulates insulin release, exacerbating hypokalemia. Option D (Sodium bicarbonate) alkalinizes the serum, further driving potassium into cells and worsening paralysis.","conceptual_foundation":"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is a hereditary channelopathy usually caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle voltage-gated calcium channel gene CACNA1S or sodium channel gene SCN4A. It is classified under neuromuscular ion channel disorders in ICD-11 (8A40.00) and DSM-5-TR doesn\u2019t directly address it as a psychiatric disorder. Differential diagnoses include hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. The condition often presents in adolescence with transient episodes of flaccid weakness triggered by carbohydrate-rich meals, rest after exercise, or stress.","pathophysiology":"In HypoPP, mutated ion channels cause paradoxical depolarization of the muscle fiber resting membrane potential under hypokalemic conditions. Low extracellular potassium hyperpolarizes normal muscle but with mutant channels, an aberrant inward current leads to sustained depolarization, inactivation of sodium channels, and failure of action potential generation. Acetazolamide\u2019s induced acidosis shifts the potassium equilibrium and stabilizes membrane excitability.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients experience episodic flaccid paralysis predominantly of the proximal limbs, sparing cranial muscles in most cases. Attacks last hours to days and may be precipitated by carbohydrate ingestion or rest after strenuous exercise. Serum potassium during attacks typically falls below 3.0 mmol/L. Between episodes, neuromuscular examination and CK levels are normal.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: measure serum potassium during an attack, perform EMG with long exercise test showing characteristic decrement post-exercise, and genetic testing for CACNA1S/SCN4A (sensitivity ~65\u201380%). Second-tier: provocative testing with glucose-insulin (not routinely recommended due to risk). Third-tier: muscle biopsy is obsolete. Pretest probability is high in familial cases with typical triggers.","management_principles":"Acute: oral or IV potassium chloride to restore serum K+ to 3.5\u20134.0 mmol/L. Prophylaxis: acetazolamide 125\u2013500 mg daily (NNT ~2 to prevent one attack per year), or potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone in intolerant patients. Avoid triggers and maintain normal dietary potassium intake.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor serum electrolytes and renal function every 3\u20136 months. Adjust prophylaxis based on attack frequency. Genetic counseling and screening of first-degree relatives are recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are first-line prophylaxis by inducing mild acidosis. 2. Avoid glucose-containing IV fluids in acute attacks. 3. The long exercise EMG test is highly sensitive (>80%). 4. Attacks are often triggered by rest after strenuous exercise. 5. Thyrotoxicosis must be excluded in new-onset cases.","references":"1.
