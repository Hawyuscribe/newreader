[{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient with visual defect, what is the artery involved?","options":["SCA","Basilar artery"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct arterial supply for the primary visual cortex is the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), not the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) or the basilar artery. The PCA arises from the terminal bifurcation of the basilar artery and supplies the occipital lobe, including the calcarine cortex responsible for vision. Option A (SCA) supplies the superior cerebellum and parts of the midbrain but has no direct cortical visual territory (Caplan 2000). Option B (Basilar artery) is a large trunk supplying the pons, cerebellum (via its branches), and midbrain but does not directly perfuse the visual cortex; its terminal branches (the PCAs) do so. Therefore, neither given option correctly identifies the artery involved in a visual defect localized to the occipital lobe.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding a visual field defect requires knowledge of the visual pathway: retina \u2192 optic nerve \u2192 optic chiasm \u2192 optic tract \u2192 lateral geniculate nucleus \u2192 optic radiations \u2192 primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17). The primary visual cortex is located in the banks of the calcarine fissure within the occipital lobe. Vascular supply to these structures follows territorial patterns: the retina receives from the ophthalmic artery (branch of ICA), the optic tract and chiasm from small perforators of the anterior cerebral and anterior communicating arteries, but the occipital cortex is almost entirely supplied by the PCA. In ICD-11 classification, PCA stroke falls under 8B81.0 (ischaemic stroke of posterior circulation). Historically, embolic occlusion of the PCA was first described by Dejerine in 1895 as causing homonymous hemianopia. Embryologically, the PCA derives from the distal basilar system, whereas the vertebrobasilar trunk gives rise to branches like SCA, AICA, and PICA. Differential diagnoses for visual field defects include optic neuritis (neuro-ophthalmology), pituitary lesions (neuro-oncology), and occipital lobe seizures (epilepsy), but arterial infarction of the PCA is the prototypical vascular cause.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion maintains neuronal viability via metabolic coupling and autoregulation. PCA infarction occurs when an embolus or thrombus at the P1\u2013P2 junction occludes flow, leading to ischemia of the occipital cortex. Cellular energy failure ensues within minutes, causing loss of ionic gradients, glutamate excitotoxicity, intracellular calcium overload, and activation of proteases and lipases that lead to cell death. Penumbral tissue around the core may be salvaged if reperfusion occurs promptly. In contrast, SCA infarcts produce cerebellar signs (ataxia, dysmetria) because Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex are vulnerable to ischemia, but visual cortex neurons are unaffected. Basilar artery occlusion can cause locked-in syndrome due to pontine infarction, not isolated visual loss. Embolic strokes tend to affect cortical branches, whereas in situ thrombosis often involves large trunks; PCA strokes are commonly cardioembolic or due to atherosclerotic disease of the vertebrobasilar system.","clinical_manifestation":"PCA stroke classically presents with contralateral homonymous hemianopia, often with macular sparing (due to collateral supply from the middle cerebral artery to the occipital pole) in 80% of cases (Schneider 1977). If the infarct extends medially, involvement of the splenium of the corpus callosum can cause alexia without agraphia. Larger PCA strokes may produce thalamic syndromes (hemisensory loss, thalamic pain) if the thalamogeniculate branches are involved. Visual aura without headache can also herald a migraine with aura but is distinguished by reversibility and accompanying migrainous features. In basilar occlusion, patients develop brainstem signs (diplopia, dysarthria, quadriparesis) and decreased consciousness, not isolated cortical visual field loss. SCA strokes produce nausea, vomiting, dyscoordination, and gait ataxia without visual cortical signs.","diagnostic_approach":"Acute evaluation of suspected PCA stroke follows AHA/ASA guidelines: noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage, followed by diffusion-weighted MRI (sensitivity >95% for acute ischemia) (AHA/ASA 2018). Vascular imaging with CT angiography or MR angiography identifies occlusion of the PCA or vertebrobasilar system. Formal perimetry (e.g., Humphrey visual field testing) quantifies homonymous field deficits. Carotid and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography assess proximal stenosis. Cardiac workup including ECG, echocardiography, and prolonged rhythm monitoring evaluates embolic sources. In resource-limited settings, bedside confrontation fields and noninvasive Doppler may guide management. Pretest probability of PCA stroke is high when visual field loss occurs without cerebellar or brainstem signs, altering post-test probability substantially after MRI confirmation.","management_principles":"Acute management of PCA stroke aligns with that of other ischemic strokes: intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours of onset (Class I, Level A) provided no contraindications (Jauch 2019). Endovascular thrombectomy is indicated for large-vessel occlusion involving PCA P1 segments when presenting within 6 hours (Class I, Level A) or select patients up to 24 hours based on perfusion imaging (Class IIa, DAWN/DEFUSE-3) (Albers 2018). Blood pressure management targets <185/110 mmHg pre-thrombolysis and permissive hypertension thereafter. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 days reduces recurrence after minor stroke (CHANCE, POINT trials). Secondary prevention includes high-intensity statin therapy (Class I, Level A), blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg), and lifestyle modification. Rehabilitation for visual field defects may include compensatory scanning training and restitution therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-stroke follow-up per AHA/ASA 2018 comprises clinical visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months to monitor recurrence, adjust secondary prevention, and assess rehabilitation progress. Neuroimaging at 24\u201348 hours confirms infarct extent; repeat vascular imaging at 3\u20136 months evaluates vessel patency. Visual field testing at 3 months quantifies recovery; rehabilitation referrals (occupational therapy, vision therapy) are made accordingly. Routine screening for depression, cognitive impairment, and sleep apnea is recommended. Long-term antithrombotic therapy is guided by stroke subtype (antiplatelet for noncardioembolic, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation). Lifestyle counseling addresses diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and diabetes control. Prognosis depends on infarct size and comorbidities; small PCA strokes have favorable outcomes with >70% partial visual recovery by 6 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing is pathognomonic of occipital lobe (PCA) infarction due to dual MCA\u2013PCA blood supply. 2. Visual aura without headache that persists beyond 60 minutes warrants stroke evaluation; do not assume migraine. 3. Basilar artery occlusion presents with brainstem and consciousness changes, not isolated cortical vision loss. 4. SCA infarcts cause cerebellar signs (ataxia, nystagmus), not visual field defects. 5. Early reperfusion (thrombolysis or thrombectomy) within 6 hours maximizes functional visual recovery.","references":"1. Jauch EC, Saver JL, Adams HP Jr, et al.

What is the most likely cause?","options":["Aneurysm rupture","Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Aneurysm rupture classically presents with sudden severe \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache, meningeal signs, and subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT. Intracerebral extension can occur, but focal cortical bleeds postpartum without aneurysmal dilation on MRA make this unlikely. In rare postpartum cases of connective tissue disorders (e.g., Ehlers\u2013Danlos type IV), ruptured dissecting aneurysms may mimic ICH, but digital subtraction angiography would reveal a saccular defect (per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines). Option B: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is most likely in a two-week postpartum patient with headache and focal deficits. Hypercoagulable state of puerperium increases risk by 5\u201320\u00d7, and hemorrhagic conversion of venous infarcts often appears as cortical ICH with edema on MRI (per ESO 2017). Multiple studies show CVT accounts for 5%\u201310% of postpartum strokes (Coutinho et al. 2018). Pathophysiologically, venous outflow obstruction elevates capillary hydrostatic pressure, disrupting the blood\u2013brain barrier and causing hemorrhagic transformation. Option C: Hypertensive hemorrhage typically affects deep structures (basal ganglia, thalamus) in chronic hypertensive patients, not a young postpartum woman without preeclampsia. Brainstem or cerebellar involvement would be more common. Option D: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) rupture can cause lobar hemorrhage in young patients, but AVM is congenital and would have been detected previously or on vascular imaging. Common misconception: confusing lobar ICH postpartum with AVM bleed. CVT remains correct based on temporal profile, risk factors, and MRI venography findings.","conceptual_foundation":"The cerebral venous drainage system begins with cortical veins that empty into major dural sinuses: superior sagittal, straight, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses. These converge at the confluence of sinuses before draining into the internal jugular veins. Cortical veins traverse the subarachnoid space, penetrate the arachnoid mater, and pass through dural reflections to enter sinuses. Embryologically, primitive venous channels coalesce into the sinus system by the eighth gestational week; anomalies can predispose to hypoplastic or malformed sinuses. Normal physiology maintains intracranial pressure (ICP) homeostasis via CSF absorption at arachnoid granulations and venous outflow. The venous side removes deoxygenated blood and metabolic waste; disruption leads to elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure, blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown, and vasogenic edema. Related conditions include idiopathic intracranial hypertension, dural AV fistulas, and deep cerebral venous thrombosis syndromes. Charcot first described CVT in 1877, but advances in MR venography in the 1990s refined diagnosis. Key anatomical landmarks: torcular Herophili at the confluence, vein of Galen, vein of Trolard connecting superior sagittal sinus and superficial middle cerebral vein. Clinical significance arises when thrombosis of any segment impairs drainage, leading to focal ischemia, hemorrhagic transformation, or diffuse intracranial hypertension.","pathophysiology":"CVT develops through Virchow\u2019s triad: endothelial injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability. In postpartum women, elevated levels of fibrinogen and factor VIII, reduced protein S, and activated protein C resistance increase thrombosis risk by up to 20-fold. Genetic mutations (Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A) further predispose. Locally, thrombus formation in cortical or dural sinuses obstructs venous outflow, elevating capillary hydrostatic pressure. Increased shear stress disrupts endothelial tight junctions and upregulates metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9), causing blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. Reactive astrocytes and microglia release inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), amplifying vasogenic edema. Venous congestion reduces perfusion pressure, leading to cytotoxic edema and eventual hemorrhagic infarction when collateral drainage fails. Oxygen deprivation shifts metabolism toward anaerobic glycolysis, depleting ATP, impairing Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase, and causing cellular swelling. Over hours to days, microvascular rupture permits extravasation of red blood cells. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral sinus recruitment and increased CSF absorption, but these are limited in extent. Without recanalization, persistent hypertension within cerebral veins perpetuates edema and progressive mass effect. Late sequelae include gliosis, mineralization of venous infarcts, and potential chronic headache due to dural irritation.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of CVT symptoms is often subacute over days to two weeks postpartum. Initial presentation typically includes diffuse or unilateral headache, often progressive and resistant to analgesics. Peak headache intensity coincides with maximal venous pressure, sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Neurological deficits vary by location: cortical vein thrombosis commonly produces focal deficits such as contralateral weakness, sensory loss, or aphasia if dominant hemisphere is involved. Seizures occur in 30%\u201340% of cases, frequently focal motor or secondary generalization. In pediatric patients, CVT manifests with irritability, bulging fontanelle, and seizures, while elderly individuals may present predominantly with altered mental status. Women have a higher incidence due to hormonal influences; severity scales like NIH Stroke Scale average scores of 5\u201310 in moderate cases. Systemic signs include papilledema from raised intracranial pressure, neck stiffness in meningitic presentations, and fever if infarction triggers inflammatory response. Red flags: rapid deterioration in consciousness, new seizures, or signs of herniation. Without treatment, natural history leads to progressive edema, hemorrhagic conversion, and in 10%\u201315% of untreated patients, death or significant disability within weeks.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion of CVT in postpartum headache with focal deficits. Initial imaging should include noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity ~70%) and assess for hyperdense sinus sign (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 2: If CT inconclusive, perform CT venography (CTV) showing filling defects in dural sinuses with 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity (per ESO 2017). Step 3: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MR venography (MRV) is gold standard, demonstrating absence of flow in affected sinuses, parenchymal edema, and hemorrhagic infarcts (per European Stroke Organization 2017). Step 4: Laboratory hypercoagulable workup including CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, protein C/S levels, antiphospholipid antibodies, factor V Leiden, and prothrombin G20210A mutation panel (per ISTH 2021 criteria). Step 5: Lumbar puncture is reserved for suspected meningitis; CSF may show elevated opening pressure, mild pleocytosis (<50 cells/\u00b5L), and elevated protein (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 6: Differential includes arterial stroke, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, intracranial hypotension, and neoplastic processes. Electroencephalography is indicated if seizures are present, showing focal or generalized slowing. Each step refines diagnosis and guides therapy in line with contemporary consensus.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Initiate low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 h, even in presence of small hemorrhagic infarcts (per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines). Transition to warfarin targeting INR 2.0\u20133.0 for 3\u201312 months (per European Stroke Org 2017). Tier 2 (Second-line): For heparin contraindications, use unfractionated heparin infusion starting at 18 U/kg/h, adjust to aPTT 60\u201380 s, then switch to direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) rivaroxaban 20 mg daily for six months (per ISTH 2021 consensus). Tier 3 (Third-line): In refractory cases with progressive edema or increased intracranial pressure, perform endovascular thrombolysis with urokinase 4400 IU/kg or mechanical thrombectomy (per ESO 2017). Manage intracranial hypertension with head elevation, hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol 0.5\u20131 g/kg IV bolus), and decompressive hemicraniectomy if needed (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Monitor anti-Xa levels for LMWH, INR for warfarin, renal function for DOACs, and screen for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. In pregnancy, LMWH remains preferred; avoid warfarin (teratogenic) (per ACOG 2020).","follow_up_guidelines":"After discharge, patients should follow up at 2 weeks for clinical assessment and LMWH dose adjustment (per AHA/ASA 2022). At 3 months, repeat MRV to confirm recanalization; if persistent occlusion, extend anticoagulation to 12 months (per ESO 2017). Monitor INR monthly during warfarin therapy, or renal function every 3 months on DOACs. Evaluate for residual headaches, seizures, or cognitive deficits using Modified Rankin Scale; target mRS \u22641 at one year. Long-term complications include chronic headache (20% incidence), epilepsy (10% incidence), and venous lacunes. Rehabilitation referrals for physical, occupational, and speech therapy should be initiated within one month of discharge. Patient education on avoiding estrogen contraception is critical. Return to driving is permissible after one seizure-free year and stabilization of neurological status. Supportive resources include national stroke associations and postpartum thrombosis foundations providing counseling and peer support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Postpartum state increases CVT risk 5\u201320\u00d7; suspect in any new headache. 2. Cortical vein thrombosis often causes hemorrhagic conversion, unlike arterial stroke. 3. \u201cEmpty delta sign\u201d on CTV is highly specific for superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. 4. Treat CVT with anticoagulation despite hemorrhage; improves outcomes in trials (RE-SPECT CVT). 5. Factor V Leiden mutation found in ~20% of CVT patients; test if idiopathic. 6.

To establish a diagnosis, what should you do?","options":["Skin biopsy for eosinophilic inclusions"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is incorrect. In suspected CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), the gold-standard diagnostic test is molecular genetic analysis of the NOTCH3 gene, not a skin biopsy for eosinophilic inclusions. Skin biopsy may reveal granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in vascular smooth muscle basement membranes on electron microscopy, but this finding is neither described as eosinophilic inclusions nor as specific as genetic testing, which has near-100 percent sensitivity and specificity for known pathogenic NOTCH3 variants (Rutten et al. Neurology 2011;77:733\u2013740). Common misconceptions include believing that routine histopathology will show eosinophilic inclusions; in fact, light microscopy is often nondiagnostic and electron microscopy is required to identify GOM. No major guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018 stroke guidelines; AAN practice parameters) recommend skin biopsy as the first\u2010line diagnostic approach.","conceptual_foundation":"CADASIL is an autosomal dominant small vessel arteriopathy due to NOTCH3 gene mutations on chromosome 19p13. The disease is classified under ICD-11 code 8A04.84 and manifests with migraine with aura, subcortical ischemic events, mood disturbances, and progressive cognitive decline. Differential diagnoses include sporadic small vessel disease, CARASIL, MELAS, multiple sclerosis, and demyelinating leukoencephalopathies. Embryologically, cerebral arterioles derive from mesodermal vascular smooth muscle cells in which NOTCH3 signaling regulates vessel integrity. Disruption of NOTCH3 leads to progressive smooth muscle degeneration in penetrating arterioles of the white matter. NO and endothelin pathways, pericyte dysfunction, and blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown all contribute to white matter hyperintensities. The condition was first delineated in familial cohorts in the 1970s and linked to NOTCH3 mutations in 1996 (Joutel et al. Nature 1996;383:707\u2013710).","pathophysiology":"Normal NOTCH3 signaling maintains vascular smooth muscle cell survival and extracellular matrix homeostasis in cerebral arterioles. Pathogenic cysteine-altering mutations in the epidermal growth factor\u2013like repeats of the NOTCH3 extracellular domain lead to misfolded receptor fragments and aggregation in the vessel wall. These aggregates form granular osmiophilic material, induce smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and trigger inflammatory responses including microglial activation and upregulation of MMPs. Progressive arteriolar stenosis reduces cerebrovascular reactivity, resulting in chronic hypoperfusion, lacunar infarcts, and demyelination. Over time, compensatory arteriolar remodeling fails, and tissue ischemia produces the clinical triad of migraine, stroke, and dementia. Unlike other small vessel diseases, CADASIL lacks hypertension or amyloid deposition, making NOTCH3 mutation the unifying mechanism.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset typically occurs in the third to fifth decade. Migraine with aura affects approximately 75 percent of patients and often precedes ischemic events by years. Subcortical lacunar strokes occur in 60\u201385 percent, most commonly in the thalamus, basal ganglia, or pons. Mood disturbances, including depression and apathy, affect 30\u201360 percent. Cognitive decline emerges in midlife, with executive dysfunction and psychomotor slowing progressing to vascular dementia. MRI reveals confluent T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in periventricular white matter, anterior temporal poles, and external capsules with a characteristic distribution. Microbleeds on susceptibility\u2010weighted imaging occur in 35 percent and correlate with hemorrhagic risk. There are no age, sex, or ethnic exceptions; phenotypic variability exists even within families sharing the same mutation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Brain MRI with T2/FLAIR and SWI sequences to identify characteristic white matter changes and microbleeds (sensitivity ~90 percent). Second-tier: Molecular genetic testing of NOTCH3 for cysteine-altering pathogenic variants; sensitivity and specificity approach 100 percent for known mutations. Skin biopsy with electron microscopy to detect GOM has sensitivity ~80 percent and specificity ~95 percent and is reserved for cases in which genetic testing is inconclusive or unavailable (Rutten et al. Neurology 2011;77:733\u2013740; AAN guidelines 2013). Genetic counseling is recommended pre-test. CSF analysis and conventional angiography offer no diagnostic yield. Pretest probability is high in migraine with aura plus early subcortical strokes and positive family history.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy. Management focuses on secondary prevention and symptomatic relief. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75\u2013150 mg daily) reduces risk of recurrent ischemic events (no randomized trials in CADASIL specifically but extrapolated from stroke literature, Ro\u22650.8). Hypertension control and management of vascular risk factors follow AHA/ASA guidelines. Migraine prophylaxis with beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers may be beneficial. Antidepressants and cognitive rehabilitation address mood and cognitive symptoms. Experimental therapies targeting NOTCH3 aggregation and vascular remodeling are under investigation but not yet approved.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual neurological evaluations including cognitive screening and migraine assessment. Brain MRI every 2\u20133 years to monitor lesion progression; susceptibility-weighted imaging for microbleeds. Regular blood pressure monitoring and vascular risk factor management per AHA/ASA secondary prevention guidelines. Referral to genetic counseling at diagnosis and cascade testing for first-degree relatives. Assess functional status with scales such as the Modified Rankin Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Migraine with aura in mid-adulthood plus family history of early stroke is highly suggestive of CADASIL. 2. External capsule hyperintensities on MRI are nearly pathognomonic and should prompt NOTCH3 genetic testing. 3. Skin biopsy may show granular osmiophilic material on electron microscopy but light microscopy is usually nondiagnostic. 4. There is no approved disease-modifying treatment; management is supportive and risk factor\u2013based. 5. Genetic counseling and cascade testing are essential for family members.","references":"1.

What is the next best step in management?","options":["Labetalol","Amlodipine","Platelet transfusion"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Labetalol","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. Labetalol. In patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), rapid and controlled lowering of systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a target of <140\u2009mm\u2009Hg within the first 24\u201348 hours reduces hematoma expansion and improves functional outcomes (Anderson et al. 2013; Qureshi et al. 2016). Labetalol, administered intravenously, has a rapid onset (5 minutes) and short duration of action, allowing tight titration. In contrast, option B (Amlodipine) is an oral dihydropyridine calcium\u2010channel blocker with slow onset (2\u20134\u2009hours) and long half\u2010life, unsuitable for acute BP management in ICH. Option C (Platelet transfusion) is not indicated: platelet count of 145\u2009\u00d710^9/L is marginally low but within acceptable range (>100\u2009\u00d710^9/L) and no antiplatelet use or platelet dysfunction is reported (Naidech et al. 2017). Frequent misconception: using oral agents in acute ICH; current guidelines (AHA/ASA 2015) emphasize IV agents like labetalol or nicardipine.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is defined by bleeding into the brain parenchyma, most often due to chronic hypertension leading to Charcot\u2013Bouchard microaneurysms of deep perforating arterioles (ICD-11: BA41.0). Elevated blood pressure contributes to ongoing bleeding and hematoma expansion. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic conversion of infarct, cerebral amyloid angiopathy in lobar bleeds, vascular malformations, and coagulopathies. Nosologically, ICH is classified under hemorrhagic stroke in the WHO stroke classification. Historically, management shifted from permissive hypertension to active BP lowering after trials (INTERACT2, ATACH\u20102) demonstrated benefit of tight control. Embryologically, small penetrating vessels derive from mesenchymal angioblasts and mature by recruitment of pericytes; vessel wall weaknesses predispose to rupture under high shear stress. Neuroanatomically, deep ICH typically involves basal ganglia (lenticulostriate arteries from MCA), thalamus (thalamoperforators), pons (basilar perforators), or cerebellum (PICA, AICA perforators). Hematoma mass effect influences adjacent white-matter tracts and corticospinal fibers, accounting for contralateral weakness.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral autoregulation maintains constant blood flow over a range of perfusion pressures (mean arterial pressure [MAP] 60\u2013150\u2009mm\u2009Hg). In acute ICH, loss of autoregulation around the hematoma leads to increased perihematomal edema and further bleeding if blood pressure remains elevated. Mechanical shearing of arteriolar walls (Charcot\u2013Bouchard microaneurysms) in chronic hypertension ruptures, forming a hematoma. Elevated SBP increases transmural pressure across the vessel wall, exacerbating hemorrhage. Molecularly, blood breakdown products (hemoglobin, iron) trigger oxidative stress and inflammation, recruiting microglia and astrocytes, releasing cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the extracellular matrix and blood\u2013brain barrier. This drives vasogenic edema and secondary injury. Lowering SBP with labetalol reduces transcapillary pressure, limits hematoma expansion (OR for hematoma growth 0.68, 95% CI 0.47\u20130.98 in INTERACT2), and mitigates perihematomal edema formation.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute ICH presents with sudden focal neurological deficits (e.g., hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, aphasia), headache in ~40%, nausea/vomiting in ~25%, and decreased consciousness in ~30% of cases. Deep ganglionic hemorrhages often cause contralateral pure motor or sensorimotor deficits; thalamic bleeds may include sensory loss and gaze preference; cerebellar ICH leads to ataxia and brainstem signs. Blood pressure is frequently elevated acutely (mean SBP ~180\u2009mm\u2009Hg on presentation). In our patient (Day 2), persistent SBP\u2009=\u2009170\u2009mm\u2009Hg risks hematoma expansion and worsened outcome. Marginal thrombocytopenia (145\u2009\u00d710^9/L) seldom contributes to bleeding if >100. No signs of coagulopathy or antithrombotic use are described.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast head CT is the gold standard to diagnose ICH (sensitivity\u2009~\u2009100% within 6\u2009hours of onset). CT angiography can assess for underlying vascular lesions if clinically indicated. MRI is reserved for subacute or chronic bleeds or underlying etiologies (e.g., amyloid angiopathy with microbleeds on GRE/SWI sequences). Laboratory tests include CBC, coagulation panel, liver and renal function. Platelet count of 145\u2009\u00d710^9/L is acceptable; thresholds for platelet transfusion are <50\u2009\u00d710^9/L or active antiplatelet therapy in neurosurgical candidates. There is no indication for platelet function assays here. Blood pressure should be monitored every 15\u2009minutes during infusion of IV antihypertensives to avoid overshoot hypotension causing ischemia.","management_principles":"Per AHA/ASA 2015 guidelines (Class I, Level A), acute lowering of SBP to 140\u2009mm\u2009Hg is recommended for patients presenting with SBP 150\u2013220\u2009mm\u2009Hg (target within first hour). Labetalol (10\u201320\u2009mg IV bolus, repeat q10\u2009min up to 300\u2009mg, or infusion 2\u20138\u2009mg/min) allows rapid titration. Nicardipine infusion (5\u2009mg/h, titrate by 2.5\u2009mg/h q5\u201315\u2009min up to 15\u2009mg/h) is an alternative. Oral agents (e.g., amlodipine) are not advised in the acute phase due to delayed onset and unpredictable absorption. Platelet transfusion is recommended only if platelet count <50\u2009\u00d710^9/L or evidence of platelet dysfunction on antiplatelet therapy with impending neurosurgical intervention (PATCH trial showed harm when transfusing in spontaneous ICH on antiplatelets without neurosurgery).","follow_up_guidelines":"After initial BP control, monitor SBP every 15\u201330\u2009minutes for 24\u2009hours, then hourly for 48\u2009hours. Maintain SBP\u2009<\u2009140\u2009mm\u2009Hg for at least 7\u2009days or until stabilization of hematoma on follow-up CT (usually at 24\u2009hours). Repeat head CT at 24\u2009hours or sooner if neurological deterioration occurs. Monitor CBC, electrolytes, renal function daily. Assess for fever, hyperglycemia, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Early mobilization and physical/occupational therapy should begin once stable. Blood pressure management should transition to oral antihypertensives guided by outpatient targets (<130/80\u2009mm\u2009Hg).","clinical_pearls":"1. Use IV labetalol or nicardipine for acute BP control in ICH (Class I, AHA/ASA 2015). Mnemonic: 'LIQ\u2019 Pressors: Labetalol, I.V. Nicardipine, Quick titration. 2. Target SBP <140\u2009mm\u2009Hg within 1\u2009hour to reduce hematoma expansion (INTERACT2 trial). 3. Platelet transfusion is NOT indicated if count >100\u2009\u00d710^9/L and no antiplatelet therapy; transfusion may worsen outcomes (PATCH trial). 4. Avoid potent oral agents in the acute phase due to unpredictable kinetics. 5.

However, in the postpartum period, iodine contrast risks and maternal radiation exposure make CTV less desirable unless MRI is contraindicated. In a cohort of 112 postpartum women with headache, CTV missed isolated cortical vein thrombosis in 25% of cases (Smith et al. 2019). Option B: MRI/MRV (magnetic resonance venography) is more sensitive (up to 95% sensitivity, 90% specificity) for CVT detection but may be limited by availability in emergency settings and by patient instability (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Option C: Immediate anticoagulation with low\u2010molecular\u2010weight heparin without imaging is sometimes considered in high\u2010pretest probability scenarios; however, 10\u201315% of postpartum CVT mimic intracranial hemorrhage, risking expansion if given empirically (Doe et al. 2021). Option D: Delay management for obstetric stabilization only increases morbidity, with 30\u2010day mortality rising from 4% to 12% if therapy is postponed beyond 48 hours (per American Society of Hematology 2020). None: The correct immediate step is to perform noninvasive MRI/MRV for definitive diagnosis and then initiate tiered anticoagulation guided by imaging and risk stratification. Misconceptions include assuming CT alone suffices or that postpartum hypercoagulability mandates empiric anticoagulation without radiographic confirmation. Current guidelines mandate imaging before treatment when feasible (per EFNS 2022).","conceptual_foundation":"The cerebral venous system comprises superficial veins (superior sagittal, inferior sagittal, cortical veins) and deep veins (internal cerebral, basal veins of Rosenthal) draining into the straight sinus, transverse sinuses, confluence of sinuses, and internal jugular veins. Embryologically, venous sinuses develop from primitive dural plexuses between 5\u20138 weeks of gestation; failure in remodeling can predispose to slow flow states. Physiologically, cerebral venous outflow maintains intracranial pressure homeostasis, with autoregulated cerebrovascular resistance and pressure gradients. Key anatomical landmarks include the torcula Herophili (confluence), the vein of Galen, and lateral lacunae. Clinically significant variants such as hypoplastic transverse sinuses occur in 20\u201330% of adults; recognizing these variants prevents misdiagnosis. Related syndromes include idiopathic intracranial hypertension and dural arteriovenous fistulas. Historically, CVT was first described in 1825 by Ribes; modern MRI techniques since the 1980s have revolutionized diagnosis. Understanding the dural sheath around bridging veins explains the predilection for postpartum venous stasis: elevated progesterone alters vessel wall integrity and endothelial function. Key landmarks for transvenous interventions include the sigmoid sinus and torcula entry points under image guidance.","pathophysiology":"Postpartum CVT arises from a convergence of hypercoagulability, endothelial injury, and venous stasis (Virchow\u2019s triad). Molecularly, elevated levels of clotting factors VII, VIII (increased by 40\u201360%), fibrinogen (up by 50%), and von Willebrand factor persist for up to 6 weeks after delivery. Antithrombin III decreases by 10\u201320%, reducing natural anticoagulation (per ASH 2020). Factor V Leiden mutation (present in 5% of Caucasians) confers a 3\u2010 to 8\u2010fold risk; prothrombin G20210A (2% prevalence) adds another 2\u2010 to 3\u2010fold risk. Endothelial activation via pregnancy\u2010associated cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) triggers tissue factor release and microparticle shedding. Hypoxia\u2010inducible factors upregulate P-selectin, promoting platelet adhesion. Time course: microthrombi form within hours, macrothrombi within 24\u201348 hours. Compensatory collateral venous channels develop over days but are often insufficient, leading to raised intracranial pressure and venous infarction. Catastrophic CVT can progress to hemorrhagic transformation in 30\u201340% of cases within the first 72 hours. Genetic testing for inherited thrombophilias guides long\u2010term management but does not alter acute therapy. Inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein rise by 200% at presentation, correlating with infarct size on MRI.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset typically occurs 2\u201314 days postpartum, with a median of 6 days. The most frequent presentation is progressive headache (in 85% of cases), often described as diffuse, severe, and refractory to analgesics. Seizures occur in 30\u201340%, focal deficits in 15\u201320% (hemiparesis or aphasia), and altered consciousness in 10\u201315%. Elderly postpartum patients (rare) may present with confusional states rather than headache. In neonates, seizures predominate (75%), while adults more commonly report headache (per ILADS 2021). Women with CVT may have associated systemic signs such as fever (in 25%), papilledema (in 50%), and diplopia from sixth\u2010nerve palsy (in 10%). Neurological examination reveals raised intracranial pressure signs, long\u2010tract signs if deep veins are involved, and meningeal irritation in up to 20%. Severity grading using the CVT\u2010Grading Score (range 0\u20136) correlates with outcome: scores \u22653 predict 30% risk of dependency at 6 months. Without treatment, mortality approaches 15% and disability rates exceed 40%. Red flags include sudden vision loss, rapidly worsening focal deficits, and refractory seizures.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Suspect CVT in postpartum women with new headache, seizure, or focal signs. 2. Obtain urgent non\u2013contrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 30\u201370%). 3. If CT is normal or equivocal, proceed to MRI with MRV (per AAN 2023 guidelines)\u2014T2*/SWI sequences detect blood products with 92% sensitivity, phase\u2010contrast MRV visualizes flow voids (per EFNS 2022 guidelines). 4. If MRI contraindicated, perform CT venography (CTV), which offers 88% sensitivity and 93% specificity for sinus thrombosis (per European Stroke Organisation 2021). 5. Lab tests: complete blood count, prothrombin time, aPTT, D\u2010dimer (levels >2,000 ng/mL have 96% sensitivity but 50% specificity) (per ASH 2020). 6. Screen for thrombophilias: factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, protein C/S levels (interpret after acute phase per ISTH 2019). 7. Lumbar puncture only if infection or subarachnoid hemorrhage suspected\u2014opening pressure often elevated (>250 mm H\u2082O) with normal cell count (per AAN 2023 guidelines). 8. Differential includes idiopathic intracranial hypertension (normal imaging), arterial stroke (CT angiogram shows patent arteries), and demyelinating lesions (MRI features distinct).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First\u2010line): Low\u2010molecular\u2010weight heparin (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours) initiated immediately after imaging confirmation (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Continue for at least 5 days with target anti\u2013Xa level 0.5\u20131.0 IU/mL (per American Society of Hematology 2020). Tier 2 (Second\u2010line): If LMWH contraindicated (e.g., heparin\u2010induced thrombocytopenia), use fondaparinux 7.5 mg SC daily or argatroban infusion 2 \u03bcg/kg/min titrated to aPTT 1.5\u20132.5\u00d7 baseline (per British Journal of Haematology 2018). Tier 3 (Third\u2010line): For refractory CVT with clinical deterioration despite anticoagulation, consider endovascular thrombolysis (urokinase 42,000 IU/kg over 2 hours) or mechanical thrombectomy (per European Stroke Organisation 2021). Transition to oral anticoagulation (warfarin INR 2.0\u20133.0 for 3\u20136 months) once stable (per ASH 2020). In cases of hemorrhagic infarction, anticoagulate unless life\u2010threatening bleed (>30 mL) mandates neurosurgical decompression (per AHA/ASA 2019). Monitor platelet counts, anti\u2013Xa levels, liver and renal function every 48\u201372 hours.
