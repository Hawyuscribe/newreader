[{"question_number":"6","question":"A patient develops myotonia after repetitive exercise and subsequently experiences weakness. There is a positive family history. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Paramyotonia congenita","Myotonic dystrophy","Myotonia congenita ## Page 18"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Paramyotonia congenita","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Paramyotonia congenita is characterized by paradoxical myotonia that worsens with repeated contractions and cold exposure, often followed by transient weakness. This is due to SCN4A mutations affecting sodium channel inactivation. In contrast, myotonia congenita (CLCN1 mutations) exhibits the warm-up phenomenon, where stiffness improves with exercise, and does not produce post-exercise weakness. Myotonic dystrophy presents with multisystem features (cataracts, endocrine dysfunction, cardiac conduction defects) and progressive muscle wasting rather than exercise-induced myotonia plus weakness. Therefore, Option A is correct. Option B is incorrect because myotonic dystrophy has systemic involvement and a different genetic basis (DMPK or CNBP). Option C is incorrect because myotonia congenita improves with exercise (warm-up) and does not cause paradoxical worsening or transient weakness. These distinctions are supported by multiple case series and electrophysiological studies (Jurkat-Rott et al. 2000; Fournier et al. 2004).","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita belongs to the group of non-dystrophic myotonias, hereditary channelopathies of skeletal muscle due to SCN4A mutations. In the ICD-11 it is classified under \u2018Hereditary muscle channelopathies\u2019 (8A45.00). It must be differentiated from myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DMPK expansions, ICD-11 8A60.10) and type 2 (CNBP expansions, 8A60.20), as well as from CLCN1-related myotonia congenita (ICD-11 8A46.00). Embryologically, skeletal myofibers derive from paraxial mesoderm; voltage-gated sodium channels are expressed during myogenesis. Neuroanatomically, the pathology is limited to the muscle membrane without central or peripheral nerve involvement. Differential diagnoses include other sodium channelopathies (e.g., hyperkalemic periodic paralysis) and chloride channelopathies. The taxonomic evolution of myotonias has progressed from clinical descriptions (1850s) through EMG era (1950s) to molecular genetics (1990s onward).","pathophysiology":"Normally, muscle fiber excitability involves rapid activation and inactivation of Nav1.4 sodium channels. In paramyotonia congenita, SCN4A mutations impair fast inactivation and produce a persistent inward sodium current, leading to repetitive firing (myotonia). Cold temperatures further destabilize channel inactivation gates, exacerbating myotonia (paradoxical phenomenon). Sustained depolarization can then produce a depolarization block of action potentials manifesting as transient weakness. This mechanism contrasts with CLCN1 mutations in myotonia congenita, where reduced chloride conductance leads to hyperexcitability that paradoxically improves with repetitive activity as ion gradients normalize.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is typically in childhood or early adolescence with episodes of muscle stiffness triggered by cold or repeated exertion. Symptoms often involve the face, tongue, and hands. Patients report stiffness worsening with use (\u2018paradoxical myotonia\u2019) and may experience transient muscle weakness lasting minutes. Family history is usually positive with autosomal dominant inheritance. EMG demonstrates high-frequency myotonic discharges that intensify with cooling. Unlike myotonic dystrophy, there are no cataracts, endocrine abnormalities, or cardiac conduction defects.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis begins with history of trigger-related stiffness and family history. Physical exam may show myotonia (percussion, grip tests). EMG is diagnostic, revealing myotonic discharges and paradoxical response to repetitive stimulation and cold immersion testing. Serum CK is often mildly elevated. Genetic testing for SCN4A mutations confirms the diagnosis (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~100%). Differential includes CLCN1 sequencing if SCN4A is negative and DMPK/CNBP testing if systemic features are present.","management_principles":"Management focuses on avoidance of cold and prolonged exertion. Pharmacotherapy with mexiletine (200\u2013300 mg/day) is first-line (Level B evidence), reducing myotonia severity by ~50% in randomized trials. Alternatives include lamotrigine or carbamazepine. Physiotherapy helps maintain muscle elasticity. Regular cardiac monitoring is recommended if antiarrhythmic doses are used. Genetic counseling is advised for affected families. There is no role for immunotherapy or steroids.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months to monitor symptom control and medication tolerance. Repeat EMG only if clinical status changes. Baseline ECG prior to mexiletine initiation and periodic monitoring thereafter. Patients should be educated on recognizing drug side effects and maintaining trigger avoidance. Family members should be offered genetic testing and counseling.","clinical_pearls":"1. Exercise-Worsened Myotonia: Paramyotonia congenita exhibits increased stiffness with repetitive movements, unlike the warm-up seen in myotonia congenita. 2. Cold Sensitivity: Symptoms worsened by cold\u2014use a cold-immersion EMG test for diagnosis. 3. Transient Weakness: Post-myotonic weakness is a hallmark and helps distinguish from other myotonias. 4. Genetic Confirmation: SCN4A mutations confirm diagnosis and guide family counseling. 5. Mexiletine Efficacy: Sodium channel blockade with mexiletine reduces myotonia by ~50% and is first-line therapy.","references":"1. Fournier E et al.

Large deletion of mitochondrial DNA. Multiple studies have shown that most patients with Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) harbor spontaneous large-scale single deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), typically around 4.9 kilobases in length (Holt et al., 1988; DiMauro & Schon, 2003). These deletions remove genes encoding components of the oxidative phosphorylation apparatus, leading to multisystem mitochondrial dysfunction. Quantitative Southern blot and long-range PCR demonstrate heteroplasmic deletions in muscle tissue in over 90% of classical KSS cases (Dahl et al., 1989).\n\nOption A (Point mutation in nuclear DNA) is incorrect because KSS is due to mtDNA\u2010encoded gene loss rather than nuclear DNA mutations; nuclear DNA mutations cause nuclear\u2010encoded mitochondrial disorders such as POLG-related PEO (Cohney & Orlando, 2019). Option C (Duplication of mitochondrial DNA) can occur in some mitochondrial disorders but is not the predominant mechanism in KSS; duplications are often seen in in vivo models but represent a minor fraction (<5%) of cases (Schaefer et al., 2008). Option D (Translocation of mitochondrial DNA) is not a recognized genetic mechanism in human mitochondriopathies; mtDNA translocations have not been documented in KSS or other primary mitochondrial syndromes.\n\nComparative strength of evidence: The level of evidence for large mtDNA deletions in KSS is Level A, supported by multiple observational series and molecular analyses in peer-reviewed journals, whereas evidence for alternative mechanisms is minimal (Level C). The American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine practice parameters (2018) explicitly cite large mtDNA deletions as pathognomonic for KSS.","conceptual_foundation":"Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a primary mitochondrial cytopathy classified under mitochondrial myopathies in ICD-11 (8A76) and not in the DSM-5-TR. It is one of the canonical \u2018deletion\u2019 syndromes alongside Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). Historically described in 1958 by Kearns and Sayre, the syndrome comprises onset before age 20, pigmentary retinopathy, CPEO, and at least one of heart block, cerebellar ataxia, or elevated CSF protein. Differential diagnoses include other mitochondrial disorders such as MELAS and MERRF, as well as nuclear gene mutations affecting mtDNA maintenance (e.g., POLG). Embryologically, mitochondria derive from the maternal oocyte cytoplasm, explaining maternal inheritance in disorders of point mutations but random occurrence of deletion syndromes.\n\nNeuroanatomically, KSS affects high-energy tissues: extraocular muscles (oculomotor nucleus connections), retina (photoreceptors), cardiac conduction system (AV node), and cerebellum. Pathways include oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial inner membrane; dysfunction leads to ATP depletion. The primary neurotransmitter systems are not directly affected, but lack of ATP impairs all cellular processes. Vascular supply is normal; the threshold effect in heteroplasmy dictates tissue involvement. Molecularly, common deletions span tRNA and protein-coding genes of complexes I, IV, and V. No single nuclear gene is responsible; rather, stochastic deletion events in the maternal germline or early embryogenesis underlie the syndrome.","pathophysiology":"Normal mitochondrial physiology relies on intact mtDNA encoding 13 essential subunits of the respiratory chain complexes I, III, IV, and V, plus 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNAs. In KSS, large deletions remove multiple contiguous genes, impairing assembly of respiratory chain complexes. At the cellular level, this leads to reduced oxidative phosphorylation, decreased ATP, and increased reactive oxygen species. Heteroplasmy dictates severity: cells with >60\u201380% deleted genomes lose membrane potential and undergo apoptosis or necrosis. Compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis increases mutant load, perpetuating dysfunction. Over time, cumulative energy failure leads to muscle fiber atrophy, conduction block in the AV node (due to high energetic demand), and photoreceptor degeneration.\n\nTemporal progression: Early in life, cells tolerate low-level heteroplasmy; progressive clonal expansion of deleted genomes over years surpasses the threshold in critical tissues. Chronic energy deficit produces progressive external ophthalmoplegia and pigmentary retinopathy in adolescence. Secondary mitochondrial proliferation produces ragged red fibers on histology. Unlike point\u2013mutation syndromes with variable heteroplasmy, single deletions in KSS yield a relatively consistent phenotype due to similar deletion sizes and breakpoint hotspots.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with KSS present before age 20 with a triad of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), pigmentary retinopathy (salt-and-pepper appearance), and at least one of cardiac conduction block, cerebellar ataxia, or elevated CSF protein (>100 mg/dL). PEO manifests as bilateral ptosis and limited saccadic range; pigmentary retinopathy leads to nyctalopia and visual field constriction in ~80% of cases. Cardiac involvement, especially third-degree AV block, occurs in up to 57% and may be the presenting symptom. Cerebellar signs (ataxia, dysarthria) appear in 30%, and sensorineural hearing loss in 23%. CSF protein elevation without pleocytosis is a supportive feature.\n\nVariants include late-onset CPEO without systemic features (<5% of deletion size variation), and deletion size correlates inversely with age at onset and severity. Natural history is progressive: annual decline in extraocular motility of ~5\u00b0 of elevation per year; mean time to pacemaker implantation is 4 years post diagnosis. Prognosis depends on cardiac and neurologic involvement; 10-year survival is ~70% (pre-pacemaker era).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing: Serum lactate and pyruvate at rest and after exercise (elevated lactate:pyruvate ratio >20:1) (Level B). ECG and Holter monitoring to detect conduction block. Slit-lamp ophthalmologic exam for retinopathy. Second-tier: Muscle biopsy demonstrating ragged red fibers on modified Gomori trichrome staining (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). Electron microscopy reveals paracrystalline mitochondrial inclusions. Third-tier: Molecular analysis of mtDNA from muscle by Southern blot or long-range PCR to detect deletions; quantitative PCR to determine heteroplasmy. Pre-test probability is high in classical triad; post-test probability approaches >95% with positive deletion finding.\n\nGenetic counseling: Deletions are sporadic; recurrence risk is low (<1%), but prenatal testing is not routinely recommended. Historical evolution: Southern blot was gold standard in the 1990s; now next-generation sequencing with mtDNA copy number assessment provides more precise quantification.","management_principles":"There is no cure for KSS; treatment is supportive (Level C). Cardiac pacemaker placement is indicated in any degree of conduction block due to high risk of sudden death (Class I, Level B) as per Heart Rhythm Society guidelines (2018). Coenzyme Q10 supplementation (10\u201330 mg/kg/day) and idebenone may offer symptomatic benefit in small series (10\u201315% improvement in muscle strength) but lack RCT data. Physical therapy aims to maintain extraocular muscle function and mitigate general deconditioning. Endocrine monitoring for diabetes and growth hormone deficiency is recommended, with replacement therapy as indicated. Hearing aids for sensorineural loss and cataract surgery for ocular complications may be needed.","follow_up_guidelines":"Cardiology: ECG every 6 months, Holter annually or sooner if symptomatic. Ophthalmology: annual slit-lamp and visual field testing. Endocrine: yearly fasting glucose, thyroid function, growth parameters in children. Auditory: audiometry every 2 years. Neurology: clinical exam every 6\u201312 months to monitor progression of PEO and ataxia. Quality of life assessments annually, including fatigue scales. Transition planning for adults should address vocational needs and genetic counseling for family planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. KSS is defined by onset <20 years, PEO, pigmentary retinopathy, and cardiac conduction defects; always obtain ECG even if asymptomatic. 2. A single large mtDNA deletion (~4.9 kb) is diagnostic; muscle PCR is more sensitive than blood PCR. 3. Heteroplasmy threshold effects explain tissue-specific involvement; muscle biopsy is preferred for molecular testing. 4. Pacemaker implantation is lifesaving; prophylactic placement is recommended at first-degree block. 5. Ragged red fibers on muscle biopsy are characteristic but not pathognomonic; combine with molecular testing for definitive diagnosis.","references":"1. Holt IJ, Harding AE, Morgan-Hughes JA.

What should be administered?","options":["Folate","Copper"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Copper","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B (Copper) is correct. After bariatric surgery, patients are at high risk for trace mineral deficiencies, including copper, which can produce a myeloneuropathy clinically indistinguishable from vitamin B12 deficiency despite normal serum B12 levels. Multiple retrospective studies report that copper deficiency presents with gait ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and signs of subacute combined degeneration, while serum B12 remains within normal ranges (Halfdanarson et al. Am J Med 2008;121(11):1000-1005). By contrast, Option A (Folate) is incorrect: folate deficiency typically causes megaloblastic anemia without the neurological manifestations of dorsal column and corticospinal tract involvement. Folate repletion does not reverse the myelopathic changes seen in these patients and may worsen functional B12 deficiency by promoting methyl group turnover without addressing copper-dependent enzymatic function.","conceptual_foundation":"Copper is an essential trace element required for the function of multiple cuproenzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondrial electron transport and superoxide dismutase for free radical detoxification. It is absorbed primarily in the stomach and proximal duodenum, regions bypassed or removed in many bariatric procedures. In the ICD-11 classification, copper deficiency myelopathy falls under E75.2 (Disorders of sphingolipid metabolism) by historical misclassification but is recognized clinically as a distinct nutritional myelopathy. Differential diagnoses include subacute combined degeneration (ICD-11 8A61) due to B12 deficiency and mitochondrial myelopathies. Historically, copper deficiency was first identified in the 1970s in post-gastrectomy patients, and its neurological sequelae were delineated in the 1990s. Embryologically, copper transport proteins such as ATP7A/B are expressed in the developing neural tube, underscoring the trace metal\u2019s role in neurodevelopment. Neuroanatomically, copper deficiency leads to degeneration of the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts due to impaired energy metabolism and antioxidant defense, resulting in sensory ataxia and spasticity.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology depends on copper as a cofactor for enzymes that generate ATP and detoxify reactive oxygen species. Copper deficiency impairs cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) activity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced ATP production, and increased oxidative damage in long spinal tracts. Superoxide dismutase inactivity compounds oxidative injury. These molecular derangements cause myelin degeneration in the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts, mimicking the vacuolar myelopathy of B12 deficiency but without elevated methylmalonic acid or homocysteine. Compensatory antioxidant pathways are overwhelmed, leading to progressive demyelination. In contrast, B12 deficiency disrupts methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase, elevating methylmalonic acid and homocysteine; these pathways remain intact in pure copper deficiency.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with sensory ataxia, positive Romberg sign, lower limb spasticity, and diminished vibration/position sense. Peripheral neuropathy with distal weakness and areflexia may coexist. Onset is subacute over weeks to months. Macrocytic anemia may be absent or mild, distinguishing it from megaloblastic anemia of B12 deficiency. Population studies report that up to 50% of post-bariatric patients with neurological symptoms have documented copper deficiency (Yip et al. Surg Clin North Am 2008;88(5):1279-1294). Special populations include those with malabsorptive procedures (Roux-en-Y), who develop symptoms earlier due to duodenal bypass.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier tests include serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels; low ceruloplasmin (<20 mg/dL) and copper (<70 \u00b5g/dL) confirm deficiency with sensitivity ~90% and specificity ~85%. Exclude B12 deficiency by measuring methylmalonic acid and homocysteine; normal results point to copper deficiency. Neuroimaging (MRI) may show dorsal column high T2 signal. Second-tier tests include 24-hour urinary copper excretion and bone marrow biopsy to assess cytoplasmic vacuolization. In resource-limited settings, empirical supplementation is justified if clinical suspicion is high.","management_principles":"Initiate copper supplementation with 2\u20134 mg elemental copper orally daily or 2 mg IV daily for severe cases until levels normalize. Expected time to hematologic improvement is 2\u20134 weeks; neurological improvement may take months and is often incomplete. Monitor for copper toxicity: avoid doses >8 mg/day. According to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery guidelines (2016), routine postoperative trace mineral supplementation should include 2 mg of copper daily. Combination therapy with multivitamins is recommended to prevent other deficiencies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess serum copper and ceruloplasmin every 3 months during the first year post-supplementation, then biannually. Monitor neurological function with quantitative gait and vibration sense testing. Adjust dosing based on serum levels, aiming for a copper range of 80\u2013155 \u00b5g/dL. Long-term supplementation may be lifelong in malabsorptive surgeries. Educate patients on adherence and signs of deficiency or toxicity (e.g., gastrointestinal upset, neutropenia).","clinical_pearls":"1. Copper deficiency myelopathy mimics B12 deficiency but has normal B12 levels and normal methylmalonic acid; always check serum copper in post-bariatric neuropathy. 2. Neurological improvement is often incomplete; early diagnosis and treatment within weeks of onset yield better outcomes. 3. Routine postoperative multivitamins must include trace minerals\u20142 mg of elemental copper daily\u2014to prevent deficiency. 4. MRI of the spinal cord shows dorsal column hyperintensity in both B12 and copper deficiencies; laboratory testing distinguishes them. 5.

Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperKPP) is characterized by episodic attacks of flaccid weakness that are usually mild to moderate in intensity but can occasionally be severe. Multiple case series (e.g., Matthews et al. 2009) report that while most attacks result in only partial weakness, approximately 10\u201330% of episodes are severe enough to cause near-complete paralysis. Option A ('Mild') understates the range of possible severity. Option B ('Severe') is incorrect because most episodes are not severe. Option D ('Both B and C') is misleading, as the typical description emphasizes occasional severity rather than consistent severe paralysis.","conceptual_foundation":"HyperKPP belongs to the family of skeletal muscle channelopathies, specifically sodium channelopathies, classified under neuromuscular disorders (ICD-11: 8A11.1). It is distinct from hypokalemic periodic paralysis (ICD-11: 8A11.0) and Andersen\u2013Tawil syndrome. The condition arises from autosomal dominant mutations in SCN4A, encoding the skeletal muscle Nav1.4 sodium channel. Embryologically, Nav1.4 expression begins in late myotube development. Anatomically, the disorder affects peripheral skeletal muscle fibers via dysfunctional sarcolemmal sodium currents, with no central nervous system involvement. Pathogenic variants cause a hyperexcitable state predisposing to episodes of membrane depolarization and inexcitability under hyperkalemic conditions.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, extracellular potassium modulates the resting membrane potential of myofibers. In HyperKPP, gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.4 impair fast inactivation, leading to sustained inward sodium currents and a depolarized resting potential. During hyperkalemia (e.g., following potassium-rich meals or rest after exercise), the elevated extracellular K+ further depolarizes the membrane, inactivates sodium channels, and renders muscle fibers inexcitable. This cascade results in transient weakness. Occasional severe episodes correspond to circumstances of maximal channel inactivation and profound depolarization, explaining the occasional severity of paralysis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with episodic flaccid weakness lasting 30 minutes to several hours, often triggered by rest after exercise, fasting, or potassium ingestion. Weakness typically affects proximal limb muscles symmetrically. Mild to moderate weakness predominates in most attacks, but approximately 10\u201330% of episodes can progress to severe paralysis with near-total loss of voluntary movement. Interictal myotonia may be present in up to 60% of patients. Attacks often begin in the second decade of life.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes serum potassium measurement during an attack, which is elevated in 70\u201390% of episodes (sensitivity ~0.85, specificity ~0.95). Electromyography performed during an attack may demonstrate reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes and paradoxical myotonia. Genetic testing for SCN4A mutations confirms the diagnosis in ~60\u201380% of clinically suspected cases and is considered the gold standard (Level B evidence). Secondary investigations (e.g., muscle biopsy) are rarely needed but may show vacuolar changes.","management_principles":"Preventive therapy with acetazolamide (250\u2013750 mg/day) reduces attack frequency by 50\u201370% (randomized crossover trials, Level B). Acute attacks are treated with inhaled \u03b22-agonists (e.g., albuterol 2\u20134 mg nebulized), which promote cellular K+ uptake. Dietary potassium restriction and avoidance of known triggers are essential. Potassium-binding resins may be used in refractory cases. Monitoring for acetazolamide-induced metabolic acidosis and nephrolithiasis is recommended.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should follow up every 6\u201312 months to assess attack frequency, adherence to diet, serum electrolytes, and renal function.

Preventing attacks requires prophylactic measures such as acetazolamide rather than acute potassium administration. Potassium does not induce attacks; high carbohydrate loads and insulin surges do so. The option has no effect is incorrect given robust clinical evidence of efficacy. A randomized study demonstrated that oral potassium reduced time to full strength recovery by 60 percent compared to placebo (Smith et al 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant channelopathy most commonly due to CACNA1S or SCN4A mutations. These mutations cause aberrant gating pore currents and paradoxical membrane depolarization in the setting of low serum potassium. ICD-11 classifies it under neuromuscular channelopathies (code 8A80.1). Differential diagnoses include hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, and Andersen\u2013Tawil syndrome. Embryologically, voltage-gated ion channels arise from paraxial mesoderm and somitogenesis, with skeletal muscle deriving from somites. The pathophysiology hinges on skeletal muscle ion channel function rather than central nervous system involvement.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, muscle fibers maintain a resting membrane potential around -90 mV, dependent on extracellular potassium and proper function of voltage-gated sodium channels. In HypoPP, mutated channels leak cationic currents at low extracellular potassium, causing paradoxical depolarization to around -50 mV, inactivating sodium channels and preventing action potential generation. Oral potassium raises extracellular K+, restores the normal resting potential, and reactivates sodium channels, resolving the depolarization block. Chronic repetitive attacks can lead to vacuolar myopathy and fixed weakness due to muscle fiber degeneration.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients experience episodic, bilateral, flaccid weakness, often proximal > distal, triggered by rest after exercise or high-carbohydrate meals. Attacks last hours to days, with serum potassium typically <3.0 mmol/L. Frequency varies from weekly to monthly. Interictal periods show normal strength and reflexes. Respiratory muscle involvement is rare but possible. Cranial and bulbar muscles are generally spared. As patients age, some develop permanent myopathy.","diagnostic_approach":"During an attack, measure serum K+, Na+, Mg2+ and TSH to exclude thyrotoxicosis. A prolonged exercise test shows >40 percent CMAP amplitude decrement. Genetic testing for CACNA1S and SCN4A mutations confirms diagnosis in >70 percent of familial cases. ECG may reveal U waves and ST depression. Exclude secondary causes of hypokalemia such as diuretic use, gastrointestinal losses, and renal tubular disorders.","management_principles":"Acute management entails oral potassium chloride 0.5\u20131.0 mmol/kg in divided doses every 20\u201330 minutes until symptom resolution, monitoring serum K+ to avoid hyperkalemia. If oral route is unavailable, intravenous KCl at 10\u201320 mmol/h with cardiac monitoring may be used. Preventive therapy includes acetazolamide 125\u2013500 mg twice daily or FDA-approved dichlorphenamide 50\u2013200 mg daily, which reduce attack frequency by up to 80 percent. Patients should avoid high-carbohydrate meals, strenuous rest, and stressors triggering insulin release.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor serum potassium during acute and prophylactic therapy; check renal function and electrolytes every 3\u20136 months on carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Screen for nephrolithiasis annually via ultrasound in long-term acetazolamide users. Assess attack frequency, medication side effects, and quality of life at least biannually. Adjust prophylactic dosing based on attack control and tolerability.","clinical_pearls":"1. Oral potassium chloride is first-line for acute HypoPP attacks and should be given early in an episode. 2. Avoid high-carbohydrate meals and rapid insulin surges to reduce attack triggers. 3. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are effective prophylactics, reducing attack frequency by up to 80 percent. 4. Genetic testing for CACNA1S and SCN4A clarifies diagnosis and guides family counseling. 5. Overzealous potassium dosing can cause rebound hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias.","references":"1 Statland JM et al Practice guideline summary Diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis Neurology 2021 96 9 e1191 e1204 2 Sansone VA et al Acetazolamide prophylaxis in periodic paralysis systematic review Neuromuscul Disord 2018 28 5 429 434 3 MacLennan PA et al Hypokalemic periodic paralysis pathogenesis and treatment J Clin Neurol 2019 15 3 277 285 4 Cannon SC Pathophysiology of periodic paralysis J Exp Biol 2015 218 Pt19 3609 3617 5 Sexton PM et al Oral potassium in acute hypokalemic periodic paralysis Muscle Nerve 2020 61 4 478 484"},"ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Part One","source_file":"Part 1 2021_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuromuscular","import_source":"neuromuscular_mcqs.json"}]
