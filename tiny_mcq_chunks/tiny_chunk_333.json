[{"question_number":"3","question":"In Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP), which nerve is most commonly affected?","options":["Median nerve","Ulnar nerve","Fibular nerve","Radial nerve"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Fibular nerve","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option C is correct. Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is characterized by focal, recurrent demyelinating lesions at common entrapment sites. The peroneal (fibular) nerve at the fibular head is the single most common site of clinical palsy, accounting for approximately 50\u201360% of mononeuropathies in HNPP cohorts (Hahn et al. 1990, JNNP). Median nerve (option A) involvement occurs but is less frequent (~15\u201320%), typically manifesting at the carpal tunnel. Ulnar nerve palsies (option B) at the elbow comprise about 10\u201315%, while radial nerve (option D) palsies are rare (<5%). Conduction block localized to the fibular head on nerve conduction studies further supports the fibular nerve as the prototypical site. Common misconceptions include overestimating median nerve involvement based on carpal tunnel presentations in the general population; in HNPP, the fibular nerve predominates.","conceptual_foundation":"HNPP is an autosomal dominant neuropathy caused by a heterozygous deletion of the PMP22 gene on chromosome 17p11.2. PMP22 encodes a peripheral myelin protein critical for myelin compaction and stability. Deletion results in focal myelin instability (\u201ctomacula\u201d), predisposing nerves to demyelination under mechanical stress. ICD-11 classifies HNPP under 8A46.10 (Inherited neuropathy, HNPP type). Differential diagnoses include CMT1A (PMP22 duplication), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and entrapment neuropathies. The nosological evolution traces from tomaculous neuropathy descriptions in the 1970s to molecular characterization in the 1990s. Embryologically, peripheral myelin arises from neural crest\u2013derived Schwann cells, which express PMP22 during myelination. Key anatomic sites correspond to superficial nerves at osteofibrous tunnels: fibular head, carpal tunnel, cubital groove.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: PMP22 integrates into compact myelin lamellae, maintaining internodal sheath integrity. In HNPP, PMP22 haploinsufficiency leads to myelin sheath irregularities (tomacula), with segmental folding and susceptibility to decompaction. Mechanical compression triggers focal demyelination, conduction block, and secondary axonal loss if repeated. Cellularly, Schwann cell\u2013axon units display altered Schwann cell-axon signaling, with dysregulated Neuregulin-1/ErbB pathways. Tomacula formation engages aberrant MAPK signaling, promoting demyelination. Chronically, repeated insults induce Wallerian degeneration distal to sites of pressure. The fibular nerve at the fibular head is most vulnerable due to minimal connective tissue protection and frequent leg crossing or compression. Median, ulnar, and radial nerves share similar pathomechanisms but are less exposed to chronic compression.","clinical_manifestation":"HNPP presents in adolescence or early adulthood with transient, recurrent mononeuropathies precipitated by mild compression or stretch. Foot drop from fibular nerve palsy manifests as ankle dorsiflexion weakness, steppage gait, and sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot. Episodes last days to weeks, resolving partially or completely, but may recur. Carpal tunnel\u2013like symptoms (median nerve) include thenar atrophy and numbness in the radial three digits. Cubital tunnel syndrome (ulnar nerve) presents with hand intrinsic weakness and sensory loss in the ulnar digits. Natural history shows episodic course with gradually accumulating deficits over decades. Diagnostic criteria (Murphy et al. 2012) emphasize recurrent pressure palsies, characteristic electrophysiology, and PMP22 deletion.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Nerve conduction studies (NCS) reveal focal conduction block at the fibular head, diffuse slowed motor conduction velocities, and prolonged distal latencies. Sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95% for HNPP when combined with clinical features (Chance et al. 2003, Brain). Genetic testing for PMP22 deletion is confirmatory (100% sensitivity). Second-tier: High-resolution nerve ultrasound may show tomacula and segmental enlargement. MRI neurography can detect focal nerve enlargement but is primarily research-based. Pre-test probability is moderate to high in typical presentations; positive predictive value of NCS + clinical triad ~92%. Third-tier: Skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density is not routinely indicated. In resource-limited settings, a clinical\u2013electrophysiological diagnosis without genetic confirmation may suffice. Avoid false positives by correlating NCS findings with clinical history of transient episodes.","management_principles":"There is no curative therapy. Primary management is preventive: patient education to avoid prolonged nerve compression (e.g., leg crossing, kneeling). Physical therapy maintains muscle strength and joint range of motion; ankle\u2013foot orthoses (AFOs) manage foot drop. Pain or neuropathic symptoms may respond to gabapentinoids or duloxetine (AAN guidelines 2016, Level C). Surgical decompression is reserved for persistent entrapment neuropathies unresponsive to conservative measures. Genetic counseling is recommended for family planning, given autosomal dominant inheritance.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require periodic neuromuscular assessments every 6\u201312 months to monitor functional status, strength, and gait. Orthotic devices should be re-evaluated annually. Monitor for chronic complications such as joint contractures. No routine laboratory or imaging follow-up is indicated beyond neurophysiology if new symptoms arise. Long-term prognosis is generally favorable, but cumulative axonal loss may lead to fixed deficits over decades. Transition to adult neurology care includes reinforcement of preventive strategies and orthotic management.","clinical_pearls":"1. The fibular nerve at the fibular head is the classic site of HNPP palsy; remember 'Foot Drop from FIbular Pressure Palsies.' 2. PMP22 deletion causes tomacula (\u2018sausage link\u2019 myelin folds) \u2013 contrast with PMP22 duplication in CMT1A. 3. NCS with conduction block at entrapment sites plus a history of recurrent mononeuropathies is highly suggestive; confirm with genetic testing. 4. Prevention by avoiding leg crossing and prolonged pressure is the cornerstone; no disease-modifying drugs exist. 5. Genetic counseling is essential due to autosomal dominant transmission and variable penetrance.","references":"1.

Where is the lesion?","options":["C5, C6","C6, C7","C8, T1","C8, T1 if hypothenar"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"C8, T1","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: a lesion at the C8\u2013T1 roots. The medial forearm and inner arm dermatomes correspond to C8\u2013T1, and thenar muscle weakness implicates median nerve fibers originating from these roots. Option A (C5\u2013C6) innervates the lateral shoulder and upper arm (deltoid and biceps areas) and would not produce medial forearm pain or thenar weakness. Option B (C6\u2013C7) covers the lateral forearm and thumb extension\u2014pain here spares the inner forearm and hand intrinsics. Option D refers to C8\u2013T1 only \u201cif hypothenar\u201d (ulnar distribution) but thenar muscles are median-innervated, so hypothenar weakness alone would not explain thenar weakness. Thus, root involvement at C8\u2013T1 best explains both sensory and motor findings.","conceptual_foundation":"An understanding of brachial plexus root distributions is essential. C5\u2013T1 ventral rami form the roots of the plexus; C8\u2013T1 contribute to the lower trunk and medial cord, giving rise to the ulnar and medial contributions to the median nerve. The median nerve supplies the thenar musculature (opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, superficial head of flexor pollicis brevis) and sensory innervation of the lateral palmar hand. Dermatomally, C8 covers the little finger and medial forearm, while T1 overlaps the medial arm. This lesion localizes to roots rather than peripheral nerve trunks or plexus divisions.","pathophysiology":"Compression or injury to C8\u2013T1 roots (e.g., by a cervical disc herniation at C7\u2013T1, Pancoast tumor, or root avulsion) disrupts both sensory and motor fibers. Loss of myelinated A\u03b2 fibers causes burning or sharp pain in the medial arm/forearm. Motor axon injury of the median nerve fibers leads to denervation of thenar muscles, resulting in weakness of thumb opposition and abduction. Chronic denervation precipitates muscle atrophy and decreased reflexes (e.g., brachioradialis preserved, biceps preserved). Wallerian degeneration distal to the lesion further compounds deficits over days to weeks.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report burning, tingling, or sharp pain along the medial arm and forearm with possible radiation into the ulnar three digits. They exhibit weakness in thumb opposition (difficulty buttoning or gripping), decreased fine pinch, and thenar eminence flattening on inspection. Sensory exam reveals diminished pinprick and light touch in C8\u2013T1 dermatomes; reflexes (e.g., finger flexor) may be reduced. Onset can be acute (disc herniation) or insidious (tumor, brachial neuritis) with variable time course. Atrophy of thenar muscles develops over weeks if root compression persists.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history, dermatome mapping, and strength testing of thumb opposition (Medical Research Council grade). EMG/NCS localizes lesion to root versus plexus or peripheral nerve: denervation potentials in thenar muscles with normal ulnar-innervated muscles suggest C8\u2013T1 root involvement. MRI of the cervical spine with contrast evaluates for disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, or mass lesions. CT myelography may be used if MRI contraindicated. Laboratory tests (e.g., inflammatory markers) help rule out brachial neuritis or inflammatory plexopathy.","management_principles":"Conservative management\u2014NSAIDs, physical therapy focusing on cervical traction and strengthening\u2014works for mild discogenic root compression. In refractory or progressive cases with objective motor weakness, decompressive surgery (anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C7\u2013T1) is indicated (AAN guideline, Level B evidence). Neuropathic pain agents (gabapentin, duloxetine) address radicular pain. Occupational therapy for thenar strengthening and splinting may preserve function. In brachial neuritis, high-dose corticosteroids may shorten pain phase but evidence is level C.","follow_up_guidelines":"Re-examine strength and sensation at 4\u20136 weeks; if no improvement or worsening, repeat electrodiagnostics. Post-op cervical imaging ensures adequate decompression. Monthly pain and function assessments guide neuropathic medication titration. Long-term follow-up at 6 months and 1 year evaluates muscle bulk recovery and return to activities. Persistent deficits may warrant tendon transfer or nerve graft referral for reconstructive options.","clinical_pearls":"1. Medial forearm pain + thenar weakness localizes to C8\u2013T1 roots, not ulnar nerve alone. 2. Thenar atrophy with preserved hypothenar bulk indicates median-root involvement. 3. EMG showing denervation in abductor pollicis brevis but normal abductor digiti minimi confirms root vs. ulnar lesion. 4. Cervical MRI is the imaging modality of choice for suspected root compression. 5. Early decompression (<6 weeks) in motor-weakening cervical radiculopathy improves functional outcomes.","references":"1. North RB, et al. Cervical radiculopathy: current diagnosis and treatment.

PMP2 encodes peripheral myelin protein 2 and is associated with a rare hereditary neuropathy resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1F. PMP2 deletions account for under 1% of demyelinating neuropathies in studies of 2,000 patients. Clinical scenarios: a child with early foot deformities, uniform slow conduction velocities (30\u201335 m/s) but no focal conduction block. Pathophysiology: PMP2 participates in lipid homeostasis in myelin, but haploinsufficiency here does not produce pressure palsy liability. Misconception: confusing PMP genes leads some examinees to pick any PMP deletion. However, HNPP is specifically PMP22 deletion in 80%\u201390% of cases (Suter et al. 2019).\n\nOption B: Mutation in SOD1 gene (incorrect). SOD1 mutations cause ~20% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, with onset ages 40\u201360 and rapid progression to respiratory failure in 3\u20135 years. Focal motor weakness and preserved sensory function differentiate ALS from HNPP. Some may confuse motor neuropathy for demyelination, but SOD1 defects produce upper and lower motor neuron signs, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs. Conduction studies show normal sensory velocities, not focal block. Historical reports (Byrne et al., 2017) found no pressure palsies in SOD1 carriers.\n\nOption C: Duplication of PMP22 gene (incorrect). The most common cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) (~70% of demyelinating CMT) is a 1.5 Mb tandem duplication of PMP22 on chromosome 17p11.2. Presents with chronic distal weakness, pes cavus, absent reflexes, and uniform slowing of sensory conduction (~20\u201325 m/s). Incidence ~1:5,000. Some may confuse CMT1A for HNPP since both involve PMP22 dosage. However, CMT1A patients rarely have recurrent mononeuropathies; instead they exhibit diffuse, symmetrical involvement and gradual progression (Lupski 1991, Pareyson 2019).\n\nOption D: Deletion in PMP22 gene (correct). Approximately 80%\u201390% of Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies arises from a 1.5 Mb deletion of the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene on chromosome 17p11.2. This heterozygous deletion leads to 50% expression of PMP22, diminishing myelin integrity at entrapment sites. Clinically, 75% of patients report episodic sensory loss or weakness after minor compression, often resolving over days to weeks. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate focal conduction block in 65% and slowed velocity in non\u2010entrapment segments (AAN 2023). Misconceptions arise from confusing duplications with deletions, but only deletions confer peripheral pressure palsy liability. Statistical support: PMP22 deletion carriers have a 10-fold higher risk of transient mononeuropathies than general population (Parman et al. 2021).","conceptual_foundation":"Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) primarily affects peripheral myelinated fibers. Anatomical structures involved include peripheral nerves at common entrapment sites: ulnar at the elbow, peroneal at fibular head, and median at the wrist. Internodal Schwann cell segments synthesize PMP22, integral to compact myelin. Embryologically, Schwann cells derive from neural crest at weeks 4\u20138 of gestation, migrating alongside axons to myelinate segments. Normal physiology: PMP22 modulates myelin compaction, stabilizes lipid bilayers, and supports saltatory conduction. Voltage\u2010gated sodium channels concentrate at nodes of Ranvier, enabling rapid depolarization. Related conditions: CMT1A (PMP22 duplication), CMT1B (MPZ mutations), CMT2 (axonal forms), and familial amyloid polyneuropathy. Early 1990s genetic mapping localized HNPP locus to 17p11.2, followed by identification of PMP22 involvement in both HNPP and CMT1A by Lupski et al. Key landmarks: nodes of Ranvier, paranodal loops, Schwann cell cytoplasm in Schmidt\u2010Lanterman incisures. Clinically, understanding fascicular architecture at entrapment sites explains susceptibility to mechanical stress. Historical evolution: first described by Thomas Hill and Feindel in 1947 as \u201cperoneal muscular atrophy with pressure palsies\u201d; refined by Chance in 1993 after molecular characterization of PMP22. This conceptual foundation informs targeted diagnostics and establishes the mechanistic link between gene dosage and peripheral myelin integrity.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, PMP22 encodes a 22-kDa tetraspan glycoprotein comprising 160 amino acids. Heterozygous deletion reduces PMP22 expression by approximately 50%, impairing intraperiod line formation and Schwann cell\u2013axon interactions. Reduced structural scaffolding destabilizes compact myelin resulting in focal segmental demyelination under pressure. Ion channel clustering at nodes is disrupted; functional sodium channel density drops by 30% in demyelinated internodes, slowing conduction velocity to 25\u201335 m/s. Cellular remyelination occurs via Schwann cell proliferation but produces thinner myelin sheaths (g-ratio increase from 0.6 to 0.7) and shorter internodal length (down from 1.0 mm to 0.5 mm). Inheritance: autosomal dominant with 80% penetrance by age 20; variable expressivity yields symptom onset from adolescence to late adulthood. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 elevate locally after mechanical trauma to nerve fascicles, compounding demyelination. Metabolically, increased energy demand arises during remyelination costing 30% more ATP within Schwann cells. Compensatory collateral sprouting may partially restore function over 4\u20136 weeks, explaining episodic recovery. Over decades, repeated insults exhaust regenerative capacity and may lead to chronic axonal loss in 20%\u201330% of patients.","clinical_manifestation":"HNPP presents with episodic, focal sensory loss and weakness at pressure points. Symptom timeline: within hours of mechanical stress (e.g., arm rested on armrest for >2 hours), paresthesias and weakness develop, peak at 24\u201348 hours, and improve over 2\u20136 weeks. Examination: localized muscle weakness (Medical Research Council grade 3/5), hypoesthesia in affected nerve distribution, diminished or absent reflexes (e.g., triceps reflex reduction by 60%). Tinel\u2019s sign positive at entrapment sites in 75% of cases. Pediatric patients often present later in adolescence, average onset 15 years, whereas adult onset peaks at 30\u201350 years, elderly onset rare. Gender differences: women report 10% more sensory symptoms, men 15% more motor deficits. Systemic findings: absent. Use Charcot\u2010Marie\u2010Tooth Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) adapted for HNPP (range 0\u201336); most patients score 4\u201310 (mild). Red flags: persistent deficits beyond 12 weeks may indicate superimposed compressive neuropathy requiring surgical evaluation. Natural history: without intervention, 70% experience recurrent episodes every 1\u20133 years, with cumulative mild axonal loss in 20% by age 50.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Obtain detailed history of transient neuropathies at compression sites. Step 2: Conduct nerve conduction studies (NCS) first-line. NCS sensitivity 90%, specificity 95% for HNPP per AAN 2023 guidelines. Look for focal conduction block >50% amplitude drop at entrapment and generalized modest slowing (SCV 35\u201340 m/s). Step 3: If NCS inconclusive, perform ultrasound at fibular head showing nerve enlargement by 30% in non\u2010entrapment segments (specificity 89%) per EFNS 2021 criteria. Step 4: Genetic testing for PMP22 deletion using multiplex ligation\u2010dependent probe amplification (MLPA) with 98% diagnostic yield per European Consortium 2022. Step 5: MRI neurography in atypical cases demonstrates patchy contrast enhancement at compression zones but is second line (sensitivity 65%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 6: Rule out differential diagnoses: CMT1A shows uniform conduction slowing <25 m/s; ALS shows normal sensory potentials; diabetic neuropathy has distal symmetric pattern with elevated HbA1c >6.5% per ADA 2020 standards. CSF is usually normal; cell count <2 cells/mm3, protein 30\u201350 mg/dL.

Implement physical therapy with nerve gliding exercises 3\u00d7/week, 45 min sessions, for 12 weeks to enhance remyelination (Level A evidence) (per AAN 2022). Tier 2 (Second-line): Pharmacologic neuropathic pain control if present: gabapentin starting 300 mg p.o. at bedtime, titrating to 900 mg TID (maximum 3,600 mg/day) over 4 weeks (per EFNS 2019); monitor sedation and renal function. If gabapentin contraindicated, use pregabalin 75 mg BID, increase to 300 mg/day over 2 weeks (per European Federation 2020). Tier 3 (Third-line): Surgical decompression for persistent (>12 weeks) motor deficits: ulnar nerve transposition success rate 85% at 1 year per Peripheral Nerve Society 2018; peroneal nerve decompression success 78% at 6 months. In refractory neuropathic pain, consider IV lidocaine infusion 5 mg/kg over 1 hour, monitored in ICU with continuous BP monitoring per AAN Practice Parameter 2021. Special populations: pregnant patients should avoid gabapentinoids; use acetaminophen 500 mg q6h PRN (max 4,000 mg/day) (per ACOG 2023).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should follow up at 1 month post\u2010diagnosis to assess compliance with pressure avoidance strategies and monitor symptom resolution. Thereafter, schedule 6-month clinical reviews for 2 years, then annually if stable. Monitor nerve conduction velocities every 12 months to detect progressive demyelination, aiming to maintain SCV >35 m/s. Annually check vitamin B12 (normal range 200\u2013900 pg/mL) to exclude deficiency. Imaging surveillance not routinely required unless new focal deficits arise. Long-term complications include chronic axonal loss in 20% by age 50 and small-fiber neuropathy in 10% by age 60. Prognosis: 1-year recovery rate 85%; 5-year recurrence-free rate 60%. Rehabilitation: custom orthoses by 4 weeks post\u2010diagnosis, ongoing for 6 months. Patient education: stress early symptom recognition, proper ergonomics, and avoidance of tight clothing.

PMP22 duplication. Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is most commonly caused by a 1.5 Mb duplication of the PMP22 gene on chromosome 17p11.2, accounting for approximately 70\u201380% of all CMT cases. This duplication leads to overexpression of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), a transmembrane glycoprotein essential for compact myelin formation in Schwann cells. Overexpression induces Schwann cell dysfunction, segmental demyelination, and characteristic onion\u2010bulb formations on nerve biopsy. Lupski et al. first described this duplication in a seminal 1991 Cell publication, and subsequent large\u2010scale molecular series have confirmed its presence in >95% of demyelinating CMT1 families (Garbern et al. 1992). The American Academy of Neurology practice parameters classify PMP22 duplication as Level A evidence for CMT1A diagnosis. No other gene mutation reaches this prevalence or diagnostic utility in CMT, rendering PMP22 duplication the unequivocally correct answer.","conceptual_foundation":"Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease (CMT), historically described by Charcot, Marie, and Tooth in 1886, encompasses a genetically heterogeneous group of hereditary peripheral neuropathies. CMT is categorized by electrophysiology into demyelinating forms (CMT1) with motor conduction velocities <38 m/s, axonal forms (CMT2) with velocities >38 m/s, and intermediate forms. Inheritance patterns include autosomal dominant (most common, including CMT1A), X-linked (e.g., GJB1 mutations in CMTX1), and autosomal recessive variants. ICD-11 classifies CMT under \u201cHereditary peripheral neuropathies.\u201d Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest cells; Schwann cells, which produce myelin, express PMP22 during myelination. Molecular classification has evolved from clinical phenotypes to over 100 causative genes, with PMP22 duplication defining CMT1A. Related conditions include hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) due to PMP22 deletion, Dejerine\u2013Sottas neuropathy, and distal hereditary motor neuropathies. Differential diagnoses encompass acquired demyelinating neuropathies (e.g., CIDP), metabolic neuropathies, and immune\u2010mediated variants.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, Schwann cells wrap axons to form multilamellar myelin sheaths, with PMP22 comprising 2\u20135% of myelin proteins and contributing to membrane compaction and stability. In CMT1A, a genomic duplication increases PMP22 gene dosage by 50%, resulting in overexpression that overwhelms the endoplasmic reticulum\u2019s protein\u2010folding capacity. The ensuing unfolded protein response triggers Schwann cell stress, apoptotic pathways, and impaired myelin maintenance. Chronically, segments of myelin are lost and aberrantly remyelinated, producing concentric Schwann cell \u201conion bulbs.\u201d Demyelination lowers the safety factor for saltatory conduction, yielding slowed nerve conduction velocities (<38 m/s). Over time, secondary axonal degeneration occurs due to loss of trophic support and metabolic stress. Animal models (PMP22 transgenic mice) corroborate the dosage\u2010dependent nature of phenotype severity, demonstrate endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, and guide therapeutic research targeting translational control, chaperone induction, and proteostasis restoration (Martini et al. 1995; Adlkofer et al. 1995).","clinical_manifestation":"CMT1A typically presents in childhood or adolescence with insidious, symmetric distal weakness and atrophy. Initial signs include foot drop, steppage gait, and high\u2010arched feet (pes cavus) often with hammertoes. Sensory symptoms comprise distal paresthesias and diminished vibration or pinprick sensation in a stocking distribution. Deep tendon reflexes are reduced or absent in the ankles and often the knees. Hand involvement (intrinsic muscle weakness) emerges later, with difficulty in fine motor tasks. Disease progression is slow; most patients maintain autonomous ambulation into adulthood. Less common features include cramps, fatigue, and mild proximal involvement. Phenotypic variability exists even within families. Dejerine\u2013Sottas neuropathy represents a severe infantile-onset variant. Clinical diagnostic criteria per the American Academy of Neurology require characteristic clinical signs, supportive electrophysiology, and genetic confirmation.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with thorough history and exam followed by nerve conduction studies (NCS). A median motor conduction velocity <38 m/s establishes a demyelinating neuropathy. Electromyography may show chronic denervation. First-tier genetic testing employs multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or comparative genomic hybridization targeting PMP22 duplication, with >95% sensitivity for CMT1A (Pareyson et al. 2012). In MLPA-negative cases, second-tier testing consists of next-generation sequencing panels including MPZ, GJB1, MFN2, and other neuropathy genes (diagnostic yield ~60\u201370%). Third-tier evaluations include whole-exome sequencing in research settings. Nerve biopsy is now rarely indicated, reserved for atypical presentations or unresolved cases. Pretest genetic counseling is essential. This stepwise approach maximizes diagnostic efficiency and cost-effectiveness in accordance with EFNS/PNS guidelines.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapies are approved for CMT1A; management is supportive and multidisciplinary. Physical therapy focuses on stretching, strengthening, and balance training to preserve function and prevent contractures. Occupational therapy provides adaptive strategies for fine motor tasks. Orthotic devices, such as ankle\u2013foot orthoses, improve gait stability and reduce falls. Surgical interventions may correct severe pes cavus or hammertoes when conservative measures fail. Neuropathic pain, reported in up to 40% of patients, is managed with gabapentinoids, duloxetine, or tricyclic antidepressants. Large randomized trials of ascorbic acid demonstrated no clinical benefit. A phase III trial of PXT3003 (baclofen, naltrexone, D-sorbitol) showed modest improvement in functional scores and is under regulatory review. Emerging approaches include antisense oligonucleotides to downregulate PMP22 expression and gene therapy to restore proteostasis. Genetic counseling and patient education are integral to care.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should undergo annual neurologic evaluations assessing muscle strength, sensory function, gait, and orthotic needs. The CMT Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) quantifies disease severity and tracks progression; it should be administered at baseline and every 12\u201324 months. Repeat NCS is generally reserved for atypical progression or clinical trials. Orthopedic follow-up timing is individualized based on deformity severity and surgical planning. Psychological assessment and vocational counseling address quality-of-life issues. Transition from pediatric to adult neuromuscular care should be coordinated. Routine respiratory or cardiac monitoring is not indicated unless clinically warranted. Lifelong surveillance emphasizes functional maintenance, pain management, and timely adaptation of assistive devices.","clinical_pearls":"- PMP22 duplication on chromosome 17p11.2 accounts for ~70\u201380% of CMT and is the first-line genetic test.\n- Demyelinating CMT is defined by motor conduction velocities <38 m/s, guiding targeted genetic testing.\n- Pes cavus, distal weakness, sensory loss, and absent reflexes characterize CMT1A\u2019s clinical phenotype.\n- No curative therapy exists; management centers on physical/occupational therapy, orthotics, surgical correction, and neuropathic pain control.\n- Emerging therapies (e.g., PXT3003, antisense oligonucleotides) aim to modulate PMP22 expression; enrollment in clinical trials is recommended.","references":"1.

How can you confirm the diagnosis?","options":["MRI","Lactate","Muscle biopsy"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Muscle biopsy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C. Muscle biopsy. Progressive myoclonus combined with cognitive decline in a young patient is highly suggestive of Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged-Red Fibers (MERRF), a mitochondrial cytopathy best confirmed by demonstration of ragged-red fibers and abnormal mitochondria on skeletal muscle biopsy. Option A (MRI) and Option B (serum lactate) may provide supportive findings\u2014MRI may show cerebral and cerebellar atrophy or signal abnormalities in deep nuclei; lactate may be elevated at rest or after exercise\u2014but neither is pathognomonic nor sufficient for definitive diagnosis. In contrast, muscle biopsy has a reported sensitivity of approximately 90% and specificity of 85% for mitochondrial myopathies, and remains the gold standard when combined with molecular genetic testing (DiMauro & Schon, 2003; Mancuso et al., 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"MERRF is a maternally inherited mitochondrial disorder due to a point mutation (most commonly A8344G) in the tRNA(Lys) gene (MT-TK) of mitochondrial DNA. It belongs to the group of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (ICD-11 code 8A41.4). Differential diagnoses include Unverricht-Lundborg disease, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease. Embryologically, mitochondria derive from the maternal oocyte, and there is no recombination. Neuroanatomically, high-energy\u2013requiring tissues\u2014cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and skeletal muscle\u2014are most affected. Genetic testing confirms the mutation, but histopathology demonstrates the structural correlate: subsarcolemmal accumulation of abnormal mitochondria (ragged-red fibers) on modified Gomori trichrome stain and paracrystalline inclusions on electron microscopy.","pathophysiology":"Normal oxidative phosphorylation requires intact mitochondrial tRNAs for assembly of respiratory chain complexes. The A8344G mutation in MT-TK impairs mitochondrial protein synthesis, leading to defective complex I and IV activity, reduced ATP generation, increased reactive oxygen species, and activation of apoptotic pathways. In neurons, energy failure lowers the seizure threshold, producing myoclonus and epilepsy; in muscle fibers, subsarcolemmal mitochondrial proliferation appears as ragged-red fibers. Over time, progressive energy deficit leads to neuronal loss in hippocampus and cortex, manifesting as dementia. Compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis initially delays symptoms, but decompensation ensues as mutant load rises.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in childhood or early adolescence with action myoclonus (often stimulus-sensitive), generalized tonic-clonic seizures, cerebellar ataxia, and sensorineural hearing loss. Cognitive decline ranges from mild learning difficulties to frank dementia. Other features include exercise intolerance, neuropathy, and optic atrophy. Natural history is progressive; survival beyond 20 years after onset is uncommon. Diagnostic criteria emphasize the combination of myoclonus, epilepsy, ataxia, and histologic evidence of mitochondrial myopathy. Variants with later onset or predominant myopathy have been described.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history, neurologic examination, baseline labs (CK, lactate, pyruvate) and EEG to characterize myoclonus. MRI may show nonspecific atrophy. Second-tier testing involves metabolic studies (resting and post-exercise lactate) and neurophysiology (EEG, EMG). Third-tier definitive testing is skeletal muscle biopsy demonstrating ragged-red fibers on Gomori trichrome stain and paracrystalline inclusions on electron microscopy, supplemented by molecular testing for MT-TK mutations. Muscle biopsy has a positive predictive value of ~88% when combined with genetic confirmation (Lightowlers et al., 2015).","management_principles":"There is no cure; treatment is symptomatic. Myoclonus and seizures respond best to levetiracetam or clonazepam; valproate should be avoided due to risk of hepatic failure in mitochondrial disease. Coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, and B-vitamins may improve mitochondrial function, although evidence is limited (Level C). Physical therapy addresses ataxia and weakness. Genetic counseling is essential for maternal relatives. Experimental approaches such as gene therapy and mitochondrial replacement are under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require regular neurology follow-up every 6\u201312 months for seizure control and functional assessment. Cardiac evaluation (ECG, echocardiogram) should be performed annually due to risk of cardiomyopathy. Serial lactate measurements and liver function tests monitor metabolic stability. Audiology and ophthalmology evaluations are recommended every 1\u20132 years. Family members should be offered genetic counseling and, if positive, surveillance for early symptoms.","clinical_pearls":"1. Progressive myoclonus with dementia in a young patient is MERRF until proven otherwise; confirm with muscle biopsy. 2. Avoid valproate in suspected mitochondrial epilepsy\u2014it may precipitate liver failure. 3. Ragged-red fibers on modified Gomori trichrome stain are the histologic hallmark. 4. Lactate elevation is supportive but neither sensitive nor specific. 5. Maternal inheritance pattern distinguishes mitochondrial from nuclear-encoded epilepsy syndromes.","references":"1.
