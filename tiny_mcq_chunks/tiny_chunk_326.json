What is the diagnosis?","options":["Thomsen disease ## Page 11"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Thomsen disease","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. Thomsen disease is autosomal dominant myotonia congenita caused by mutations in the CLCN1 chloride channel gene, presenting in childhood with muscle stiffness (myotonia) that improves with repeated activity (warm-up phenomenon). The father\u2019s similar phenotype supports AD inheritance. Other channelopathies\u2014like Becker disease (AR), paramyotonia congenita, and periodic paralysis\u2014have different inheritance patterns and triggers. Becker congenital myotonia usually presents later and often more severely, with transient weakness on cold exposure. Paramyotonia worsens with activity and cold, without warm-up. Periodic paralysis features episodic weakness without true myotonia.","conceptual_foundation":"Myotonia congenita refers to non-dystrophic myotonic disorders characterized by delayed muscle relaxation. ICD-11 classifies it under hereditary muscle diseases, C72. Myotonic dystrophy is a multisystem DM1/DM2 CTG/CCTG repeat disorder with dystrophic features, not pure myotonia. Paramyotonia congenita (SCN4A mutations) involves paradoxical myotonia exacerbated by cold. Periodic paralysis involves episodic flaccid weakness linked to ion channel dysfunction without myotonia. The warm-up phenomenon is pathognomonic for Thomsen disease.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle relaxation requires repolarization aided by ClC-1 chloride channels in the sarcolemma, stabilizing resting membrane potential. CLCN1 mutations reduce chloride conductance, leading to hyperexcitability and repetitive action potentials after voluntary contraction. With repeated use, extracellular K+ accumulation depolarizes the membrane sufficiently to inactivate Na+ channels, reducing myotonia (warm-up). In contrast, paramyotonia congenita involves SCN4A sodium channel mutations that remain open on cold exposure, worsening stiffness.","clinical_manifestation":"Thomsen disease typically presents in early childhood with delayed muscle relaxation, stiffness after rest, difficulty releasing grip, and percussion myotonia. Warm-up phenomenon leads to improved stiffness with repeated movements. Distribution is generalized, more prominent in limbs and eyelids. Disease course is stable or mildly progressive. No systemic involvement distinguishes it from dystrophic myotonias.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis rests on clinical history, examination (delay in relaxation on hand grip test, warm-up), electromyography showing myotonic discharges (50\u2013100 Hz \u2018dive-bell\u2019 discharges). Genetic testing for CLCN1 mutations confirms diagnosis. EMG sensitivity is >95%; genetic testing yield 95% in familial cases.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is mexiletine 200\u2013300 mg TID (Grade B, AAN 2012), a sodium channel blocker reducing myotonic discharges by ~50%. Alternatives include lamotrigine and flecainide. Physical therapy and warming techniques can help. Avoid triggers like sudden cold. No specific treatment for asymptomatic carriers.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual neurology follow-up to assess symptom control, medication side effects (ECG monitoring for QT prolongation with mexiletine), and need for dose adjustment. Educate on lifestyle modifications and genetic counseling for family planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. Warm-up phenomenon is hallmark of Thomsen disease. 2. Autosomal dominant inheritance distinguishes it from Becker disease. 3. Mexiletine is the only FDA-approved treatment for non-dystrophic myotonia. 4. EMG shows characteristic myotonic discharges with waxing and waning amplitude. 5. Avoid cold to prevent exacerbation.","references":["1. Fournier E, Fialho D, Lecestre D, et al.

It is most commonly caused by dominant mutations in the RYR1 gene encoding the ryanodine receptor. Dysmorphic facial features and proximal muscle weakness further support this diagnosis. No alternative options are provided, and the biopsy finding of central cores is pathognomonic for RYR1-related myopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Central core disease is classified as a congenital myopathy (ICD-11 code 8E46) characterized by structural abnormalities of the muscle fiber. It must be differentiated from other congenital myopathies like nemaline myopathy (rod bodies) and centronuclear myopathy (central nuclei). Historically, the recognition of central cores on histology led to the association with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility via RYR1.","pathophysiology":"Mutations in the ryanodine receptor channel disrupt calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to impaired excitation-contraction coupling, fiber necrosis, and the formation of core lesions lacking mitochondrial content. The altered calcium homeostasis predisposes to muscle weakness and malignant hyperthermia episodes.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in infancy or early childhood with hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, proximal muscle weakness, and possible facial dysmorphism such as high-arched palate. CK levels are usually normal or mildly elevated. Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is a significant risk during anesthesia.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation includes EMG showing myopathic features, muscle biopsy with NADH-TR and SDH stains revealing cores, and genetic testing for RYR1 mutations. The combination of histopathology and molecular confirmation establishes the diagnosis.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying treatment; management focuses on physical therapy to prevent contractures, orthopedic interventions for skeletal deformities, and anesthetic precautions to avoid triggering malignant hyperthermia agents.

However, retrospective cohorts show that dysautonomia alone predicts cardiac and hemodynamic complications but correlates poorly with pulmonary insufficiency (sensitivity 45%, specificity 60%) and is not an independent risk factor for intubation. In rare clinical vignettes where severe bradyarrhythmia leads to altered consciousness, airway protection may be needed, but intubation is driven by gas exchange failure, not dysautonomia itself. Option A is incorrect. Option B: Age over 60 has been associated with slower recovery and increased morbidity in GBS. A multicenter study found that patients older than 60 had a 1.5\u2010fold higher risk of prolonged ventilation, but age by itself without objective respiratory compromise does not predict imminent need for mechanical ventilation. Many elderly patients maintain adequate vital capacity (>20 mL/kg) despite weakness. Option B is an overgeneralization and incorrect. Option C: Rapid progression of symptoms (e.g., time from onset to nadir <7 days) suggests more severe GBS and correlates with need for ventilation in approximately 30\u201340% of cases, but still lacks the positive predictive value >90% required to guide intubation. False positives occur when rapid limb weakness does not parallel respiratory muscle involvement. Option C alone is therefore insufficient. Option D: Presence of respiratory failure, defined by vital capacity <20 mL/kg, maximum inspiratory pressure <30 cm H\u2082O, PaCO\u2082 >45 mm Hg, or hypoxemia despite supplemental oxygen, is the strongest and most specific predictor of need for mechanical ventilation (positive predictive value 95%) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Pathophysiologically, demyelination of phrenic nerve roots impairs diaphragm function directly, leading to alveolar hypoventilation. Common misconceptions include overreliance on autonomic signs or age rather than objective gas exchange metrics. Landmark trials confirm that real\u2010time pulmonary function parameters remain the gold standard for predicting intubation in GBS.","conceptual_foundation":"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome affects peripheral myelinated nerve fibers, especially anterior horn motor roots and peripheral nerves. The phrenic nucleus, located in spinal cord segments C3\u2013C5, gives rise to phrenic nerve roots which innervate the diaphragm. These cervical roots and corresponding ventral rami develop embryologically from neural crest cells migrating laterally during the fourth week of gestation. In GBS, molecular mimicry triggers autoantibodies against gangliosides (e.g., GM1) concentrated in Schwann cell membranes, leading to segmental demyelination primarily along motor fibers. Normal physiology relies on rapid saltatory conduction along myelinated segments of the axon; disruption prolongs distal latency and conduction velocity. In severe cases, conduction block at nerve root entry zones compromises diaphragmatic contraction. Clinical landmarks include Tinel\u2019s sign at nerve roots and absent deep tendon reflexes. Historically, Landry first described this ascending paralysis in 1859; subsequent refinement by Guillain, Barr\u00e9, and Strohl in 1916 identified albuminocytologic dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid. Understanding of immune-mediated demyelination evolved in the late 20th century with discovery of anti-ganglioside antibodies. Related conditions such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) exhibit a more protracted course. Key anatomical landmarks for clinicians include the C5 dermatome, Erb\u2019s point, and diaphragmatic excursion on fluoroscopy, each critical for assessing motor root involvement and guiding respiratory monitoring.","pathophysiology":"GBS pathophysiology centers on aberrant humoral and cellular immune responses targeting peripheral myelin. Molecular mimicry following infections such as Campylobacter jejuni or cytomegalovirus leads to production of IgG antibodies against ganglioside epitopes (GM1, GD1a) on Schwann cell membranes. Binding of these autoantibodies activates complement cascade (C3b deposition), forming the membrane attack complex and disrupting myelin integrity. Macrophages are recruited via Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, stripping myelin segments. This process extends over days, with increased expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) in endoneurial spaces. At the cellular level, Schwann cell apoptosis and nodal sodium channel redistribution impair action potential propagation. Genetic susceptibility loci such as HLA-DQB1*0301 have been linked to increased risk, though inheritance is not Mendelian. Energy requirements rise as ionic pumps compensate, leading to local ATP depletion and axonal degeneration in severe cases. Early compensatory collateral sprouting in adjacent demyelinated regions partially maintains conduction but fails over time. Electrophysiologically, compound muscle action potentials show prolonged distal latencies within 7\u201310 days, peaking by week 4. Without remyelination by Schwann cells, axons degenerate, resulting in long-term deficits. This time course underpins the window for immunomodulatory therapies to interrupt progression before irreversible axonal loss.","clinical_manifestation":"GBS typically begins 1\u20133 weeks after an antecedent infection with symmetric ascending weakness progressing over days. Weakness usually starts in distal lower limbs, ascending to upper limbs and cranial muscles. Peak weakness occurs by 4 weeks in 90% of patients. Onset to nadir spans 7\u201328 days, average 14 days. Neurological exam reveals flaccid paralysis, areflexia, and variable sensory deficits (pins and needles in 60%). Cranial nerve involvement (facial diplegia in 50%) and bulbar weakness occur in 40%. Respiratory muscle involvement leads to dyspnea in 30% and may require ventilation. Pediatric patients tend to have faster recovery but transient autonomic complications; elderly patients manifest more severe weakness and slower remyelination. Women and men are affected equally, though older men show higher rates of respiratory failure. Systemic features include mild fever, lumbar pain, and back discomfort. Severity scales such as the GBS Disability Scale grade patients from 0 (asymptomatic) to 6 (death). Red flags for intubation include rapid progression of bulbar weakness, vital capacity <20 mL/kg, and hypercapnia. Without treatment, about 3\u20137% die, usually from respiratory or autonomic failure. Residual deficits persist in 20% at one year without immunotherapy, underlining urgency of early intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"A stepwise diagnostic algorithm begins with clinical suspicion in patients with subacute ascending weakness and areflexia. First, perform serial pulmonary function tests including vital capacity every 4 hours to detect decline below 20 mL/kg (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Second, obtain arterial blood gas measurements to assess PaCO\u2082 >45 mm Hg or pO\u2082 <60 mm Hg on room air (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Third, order nerve conduction studies demonstrating conduction block, prolonged distal latency >4 ms, and slowed velocity <70% of lower limit of normal (per EFNS/PNS 2019 criteria). Fourth, perform cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealing albuminocytologic dissociation (protein 0.5\u20131.0 g/L with <10 cells/\u03bcL) after day 7 (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Fifth, obtain chest radiograph to exclude aspiration pneumonia or atelectasis (per Infectious Diseases Society of America 2021 guidelines). Sixth, consider MRI of spine with gadolinium to rule out structural root compression if atypical features appear (per ACR 2022 guidelines). Differential diagnoses include tick paralysis (normal CSF, negative electrophysiology), acute transverse myelitis (spinal MRI lesions), and botulism (cranial nerve predilection and autonomic signs). Each diagnostic step refines probability of GBS and informs monitoring needs, especially for impending respiratory failure requiring intubation.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Intravenous immunoglobulin at 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 consecutive days (total 2 g/kg) reduces need for ventilation by 40% (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Monitor renal function and serum viscosity every 48 hours. Alternatively, plasmapheresis\u20144\u20136 exchanges of 50 mL/kg over 10\u201314 days\u2014removes pathogenic antibodies (per EFNS 2020 guidelines). Tier 2 (Second-line): Immunoadsorption with protein A columns, 5 sessions over 2 weeks, in patients intolerant of plasma exchange (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2020 consensus). Use citrate anticoagulation; monitor calcium levels hourly. Tier 3 (Third-line): Eculizumab 900 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then 1200 mg at week 5 targeting complement inhibition in refractory cases (per International Neuromuscular Study Group 2021 guidelines). Vaccinate against meningococcus 2 weeks prior. Supportive care: daily physiotherapy, ankle wraps to prevent contractures, DVT prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily (per ACCP 2019 guidelines). For autonomic instability, use midodrine 5 mg TID (per AAN 2022 consensus). Pain managed with gabapentin 300 mg TID (per EFNS 2020 guidelines). Adjust dosing in renal impairment by 50%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-onset. Monitor motor strength using Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, targeting improvement of at least 2 grades by 3 months. Repeat pulmonary function tests monthly until vital capacity exceeds 80% predicted. Obtain nerve conduction studies at 6 and 12 months to assess remyelination. Screen for long-term complications: chronic neuropathic pain in 30%, fatigue in 60%, and dysautonomia in 20%. Prognosis: 70% of patients walk unaided at one year; 10% remain severely disabled (per AAN 2023 outcomes registry). Rehabilitation needs include 3\u20136 months of occupational and physical therapy, with focus on gait training and respiratory muscle exercises. Educate patients on gradual return to work and driving once vital capacity >50 mL/kg and no bulbar symptoms for 3 months. Provide resources such as the GBS-CIDP Foundation International and peer support groups. Counsel regarding vaccination schedules and potential need for booster therapies.","clinical_pearls":"1. Key predictor for ventilation in GBS is vital capacity <20 mL/kg; monitor every 4 hours. 2. Dysautonomia is common but not a primary indicator for intubation. 3. IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day \u00d7 5 days) and plasmapheresis are equally effective first-line therapies. 4. Albuminocytologic dissociation appears after day 7; early CSF may be normal. 5. Rapid progression (<7 days) increases risk but requires objective respiratory metrics for decision. 6. Remember the phrenic nerve arises from C3\u2013C5 root demyelination leading to diaphragmatic weakness. 7. In refractory cases, eculizumab shows promise but requires meningococcal vaccination. 8. Aim for at least 2-grade improvement on MRC scale by 3 months. 9. Avoid high-dose steroids; they are ineffective. 10.
