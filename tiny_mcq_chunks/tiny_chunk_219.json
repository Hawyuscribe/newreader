A right superior oblique (trochlear) palsy produces vertical diplopia that worsens on downgaze and contralateral gaze (Park\u2019s three-step test). The right image appears higher when the right SO is weak. Option A (right abducens) causes horizontal diplopia worse on gaze to the affected side. Option C (left SO) would produce hypertropia of the left eye worse on left gaze. Option D (right oculomotor) causes ptosis, \u201cdown and out\u201d position, and pupillary involvement, not isolated vertical diplopia.","conceptual_foundation":"Extraocular muscle innervation: SO by IV, LR by VI, all others by III. Trochlear nucleus is located in the dorsal midbrain and the nerve decussates. A unilateral palsy leads to extorsion and hypertropia of the affected eye. In ICD-11, ocular motor nerve palsy coded under 8B01.X. Differential includes myasthenia gravis, thyroid ophthalmopathy.","pathophysiology":"Trochlear nerve lesions may arise from microvascular ischemia, trauma, or compression. SO dysfunction impairs intorsion, depression, and abduction in adducted position. Misalignment leads to image tilting that patients compensate by head tilt toward the opposite shoulder (Bielschowsky head tilt test positive).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report vertical diplopia worse when reading or descending stairs. On exam, hypertropia of the affected eye increases on contralateral gaze and ipsilateral head tilt. Patients adopt a head tilt toward the opposite shoulder to reduce diplopia. SO palsy is the most common isolated cranial nerve palsy in traumatic brain injury.","diagnostic_approach":"Park\u2019s three-step test: 1) identify hypertropic eye, 2) determine which gaze worsens diplopia, 3) head tilt test. Cover\u2013uncover and alternate cover tests quantify vertical deviation. Hess screen test and fundus torsion assessment can confirm intorsion deficit. MRI is indicated if atypical features present.","management_principles":"Initial treatment includes prism glasses to alleviate diplopia. Eye patching can be used acutely. If no recovery by 6\u201312 months, strabismus surgery (SO tendon tuck) indicated. Address underlying etiology: microvascular risk factor control (diabetes, hypertension) if ischemic. Botulinum toxin injection into ipsilateral inferior oblique can help in selected cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess ocular alignment every 3 months. Monitor for spontaneous recovery in microvascular palsies (70\u201380% recover within 6 months). Preoperative evaluation for prisms or surgery includes measurement of deviation in primary and reading positions. Postoperative follow-up at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months to assess alignment stability.","clinical_pearls":"1. Vertical diplopia worse on downgaze\u2014think SO palsy. 2.

A computed tomography (CT) brain scan was performed. What is the explanation for her issue?","options":["Visual anosognosia","Psychiatric","Apraxia ## Page 7"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Visual anosognosia","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Visual anosognosia) is definitively correct. This syndrome occurs when a patient with left homonymous hemianopia due to a right occipital or parietal infarct denies any visual loss despite formal perimetry confirming a field defect. Visual anosognosia affects approximately 10\u201318 percent of first\u2010time right hemisphere strokes, often linked to disruption of the fronto\u2010parietal monitoring network in up to 88 percent of cases. No psychiatric features or deliberate simulation are present, and pupillary reflexes and visual evoked potentials remain intact. Option B (Psychiatric) is incorrect: primary psychogenic visual loss or conversion disorder shows inconsistent field testing with variable defect patterns, preserved insight into other neurologic functions, and meets DSM\u20105 conversion criteria without correlating anatomically to homonymous hemianopia. Option C (Apraxia) describes a motor planning deficit\u2014either ideomotor or constructional\u2014that impairs purposeful movement or drawing. It does not explain unawareness of a visual field defect, which is detected on confrontation and perimetry rather than motor tasks. Option D (Malingering) would involve conscious feigning of deficits, inconsistent responses, and motivational gain; however, these patients typically fail to replicate visual field defects under varied testing conditions, unlike anosognosia where denial persists despite objective confirmation.","conceptual_foundation":"The visual pathway begins with retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerves, converge at the chiasm, and continue as optic tracts to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus. From the LGN, optic radiations course through Meyer's loop (inferior fibers) and Baum's loop (superior fibers) to terminate in the primary visual cortex (V1) lining the calcarine fissure. The right V1 processes input from the left visual hemifield. During embryogenesis, optic vesicles evaginate from the diencephalon around week 4, with guidance cues such as netrin and slit directing axons across the midline. Normal physiology relies on precise retinotopic mapping, intracortical feedback via the pulvinar, and occipito\u2010parietal integration for spatial awareness. Lesions anterior to V1 spare macular vision if watershed areas are intact. Related conditions include Anton\u2019s syndrome (denial of cortical blindness), Balint\u2019s syndrome (simultanagnosia and optic ataxia), and visual neglect, reflecting distinct occipitoparietal network disruptions. Historical accounts date from Descartes\u2019 17th century descriptions of blindness with intact eyes to Babinski\u2019s 1914 coinage of anosognosia. Recognition of visual unawareness advanced in the late 20th century with lesion mapping and functional MRI, refining surgical landmarks like the calcarine and parieto\u2010occipital sulci.","pathophysiology":"Visual anosognosia arises from interruption of cortical monitoring circuits that compare predicted and actual sensory input. On a molecular level, glutamatergic transmission via NMDA receptors in the occipito\u2010parietal junction is crucial for error detection. Disruption of GABAergic interneurons in the dorsal fronto\u2010parietal network reduces feedforward inhibition, leading to unawareness of contralateral visual loss. Cellularly, ischemia triggers excitotoxic calcium influx through AMPA and NMDA channels, activating caspase cascades and promoting neuronal apoptosis over hours to days. Genetic variants in the GRIN2A gene, encoding an NMDA subunit, may predispose to impaired cortical plasticity and slower recovery. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 released during acute stroke further disrupt synaptic function. Energy failure from mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion peaks within the first 24 hours, with subsequent reactive gliosis around day three. Compensatory upregulation of contralateral homologous cortex and collateral recruitment of the inferior parietal lobule can partially restore visuospatial monitoring, but these mechanisms often remain insufficient to overcome the original deficit.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of visual anosognosia is typically acute, emerging within six hours of right posterior circulation ischemia, with peak unawareness in the first 24 to 48 hours. Patients may insist they can see normally, bump into objects on the left, and fail to acknowledge questions about their visual field. Neurological examination reveals left homonymous hemianopia on confrontation testing and automated perimetry (Goldmann or Humphrey) confirming a mean deviation loss of \u221210 to \u221220 dB in the left hemifield. Pupillary light reflexes remain symmetric at 2\u20134 mm constriction latency under 200 ms. No limb neglect or hemiparesis is present in pure occipital lesions, though elderly patients may demonstrate slowed saccades (20 percent reduction in peak velocity). Severity is graded by the Anosognosia Questionnaire Self\u2010Report (AQ10), with scores above 35 indicating severe denial. Without treatment, natural history shows partial insight in 30 percent of cases by one month, but persistent anosognosia in up to 60 percent at six months. Red flags include sudden refusal of imaging or inability to perform confrontation tests reliably.","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with bedside confrontation perimetry: instruct the patient to fixate centrally and report fingers moving in each quadrant. Sensitivity of confrontation testing is approximately 70 percent compared to automated perimetry. If a homonymous hemianopia is suspected, order formal visual field testing (Humphrey 24-2 SITA-standard), which has specificity over 95 percent for detecting field defects. Brain imaging is first\u2010line: noncontrast CT has 60 percent sensitivity for acute posterior circulation infarcts within six hours; diffusion\u2010weighted MRI is over 90 percent sensitive within the first 24 hours. Evaluate cranial nerve II with funduscopic exam and pupillary responses (normal amplitude 2\u20134 mm). Consider neuropsychological testing (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale visual field item scoring) to assess awareness. Rule out mimics: functional visual loss shows normal VEPs and inconsistent perimetry patterns. In select cases, CSF analysis may exclude inflammatory or infectious processes (normal cell count <5 cells/\u03bcL, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL). If needed, visual evoked potentials reveal P100 latency delays in occipital lesions. Differential includes cortical blindness, neglect, and conversion disorder distinguished by MRI lesion correlates and DSM\u20105 criteria.","management_principles":"First-line management focuses on acute stroke protocols: administer intravenous alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) with 10 percent bolus over one minute, then infusion over 60 minutes within a 4.5-hour window. In eligible patients, perform endovascular thrombectomy within 6 to 24 hours for large vessel occlusion using stent retrievers (e.g., Solitaire) with recanalization rates of 70\u201380 percent. Secondary prevention includes aspirin 81 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily combination for 21 days if minor stroke (CHANCE trial), then monotherapy. Initiate high\u2010intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg daily) to achieve LDL below 70 mg/dL. Neurorehabilitation with visual scanning training for 45 minutes, five times weekly, improves field awareness by 25 percent over eight weeks. Cognitive behavioral therapy targeting denial may enhance insight. Monitor blood pressure and glucose tightly (BP <140/90 mmHg, HbA1c <7 percent). Contraindications to thrombolysis include platelet count <100,000/\u03bcL, INR >1.7. In refractory cases, off\u2010label use of transcranial magnetic stimulation over the parietal lobe may be considered under research protocols.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurological follow\u2010up visits at two weeks, one month, three months, and six months post\u2010stroke. At each visit assess visual fields with confrontation and Humphrey screening tests, aiming for documented improvement in mean deviation by at least 3 dB by three months. Monitor secondary prevention labs quarterly: lipid panel (LDL target <70 mg/dL), HbA1c (goal <7 percent), and blood pressure (target <130/80 mmHg). Repeat MRI brain at three to six months if new symptoms arise or to evaluate collateral circulation changes. Long-term complications include persistent visual awareness deficits in up to 40 percent at one year and increased fall risk (incidence 25 percent within six months). Prognosis: about 50 percent of patients regain partial insight by six months, and 20 percent achieve full awareness by one year. Rehabilitation services should be continued for at least three months with low-vision support and orientation\u2010mobility training. Advise against driving until perimetry shows no field defect or full insight is regained, typically requiring a six-month driving suspension. Provide patient education on stroke warning signs, visual safety strategies, and refer to organizations such as the American Stroke Association for support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Visual anosognosia affects 10\u201318 percent of right occipital strokes and may persist in 60 percent at six months. 2. Denial of left field loss despite normal pupillary reflexes and VEPs is pathognomonic. 3. CT has only 60 percent sensitivity for acute posterior infarcts; MRI DWI is preferred within 24 hours. 4.
