[{"question_number":"1","question":"A 60-year-old male presented with a history of falls, dyskinesia, and depression. His sister died at age 50 from the same condition. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Dystonia","Huntington's Disease","Depression","Parkinson's Disease"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Huntington's Disease","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Huntington's Disease. Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by choreiform movements (dyskinesia), psychiatric manifestations such as depression, and cognitive decline. A positive family history with early death in a first-degree relative, as described in the sister dying at age 50, strongly supports HD. Option A (Dystonia) refers to sustained muscle contractions causing twisting and repetitive movements but lacks the inherited chorea and psychiatric features seen here. Option C (Depression) is a symptom, not a primary diagnosis explaining dyskinesia and family history. Option D (Parkinson's Disease) presents with bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor rather than chorea, and has a more insidious onset without the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern seen in this pedigree.","conceptual_foundation":"Huntington's Disease belongs to the group of hereditary choreas under movement disorders. It is classified under ICD-11 code 8A40. HD arises from CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene on chromosome 4p16.3. Normal alleles contain up to 35 repeats; pathogenic alleles exceed 36 repeats, with full penetrance typically above 40 repeats. The mutant huntingtin protein leads to neuronal dysfunction and death, especially in the striatum and cerebral cortex. Differential diagnoses include Wilson disease, neuroacanthocytosis, and drug-induced chorea. Historically, HD was first described by George Huntington in 1872; genetic confirmation followed in 1993.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of the basal ganglia involves balanced direct and indirect pathways modulating movement. In HD, mutant huntingtin leads to selective loss of medium spiny GABAergic neurons in the indirect pathway of the striatum, resulting in excessive thalamocortical drive and chorea. On a molecular level, expanded polyglutamine tracts cause protein misfolding, aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity via NMDA receptor overactivation, and impaired transcription. The result is progressive neuronal death with increasing CAG repeat length correlating with earlier onset (anticipation).","clinical_manifestation":"HD typically presents in mid-adulthood (30\u201350 years) with chorea, psychiatric symptoms (depression, irritability), and cognitive decline. Late-onset (>60 years) can occur with milder chorea but prominent rigidity. Falls may result from choreiform movements and postural instability. Depression affects up to 40\u201350% of patients. The disease progresses over 15\u201320 years to severe motor impairment and dementia.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is based on clinical examination demonstrating chorea and family history, confirmed by genetic testing for HTT CAG repeat expansion. Molecular testing has >99% sensitivity and specificity. Brain MRI may show caudate atrophy but is not diagnostic. Genetic counseling is essential for at-risk relatives.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy. Symptomatic treatment includes tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine for chorea (VMAT2 inhibitors), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression, and atypical antipsychotics for behavioral symptoms. Multidisciplinary care involves physical therapy, speech therapy, and psychiatric support.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up every 3\u20136 months for motor and psychiatric symptoms. Monitor for drug side effects (e.g., depression with tetrabenazine). Genetic counseling updates and advance care planning are integral.","clinical_pearls":"1. HD inheritance is autosomal dominant with anticipation due to CAG repeat expansion. 2. Chorea in HD results from striatal GABAergic neuron loss in the indirect pathway. 3. Tetrabenazine is first-line for chorea but requires depression monitoring. 4. Genetic testing confirms diagnosis with >99% sensitivity. 5. Psychiatric symptoms often precede motor signs by years.","references":"1. Roos RA. Huntington's disease: a clinical review. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2010;5:40. doi:10.1186/1750-1172-5-40 2. Walker FO.

Neuropathologically. Definitive confirmation of any synucleinopathy\u2014including Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA)\u2014requires demonstration of abnormal \u03b1-synuclein accumulation in affected brain regions on postmortem histopathological examination. The 2006 AAN practice parameter and the 2018 Movement Disorder Society criteria both emphasize that neuropathology remains the gold standard, with \u03b1-synuclein immunohistochemistry demonstrating Lewy bodies and neurites in PD/DLB (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~98%) or glial cytoplasmic inclusions in MSA (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~99%) (1,2).\n\nOption A (Clinically): While clinical diagnostic criteria for PD (UK Brain Bank, MDS) and DLB (McKeith et al. 2017) achieve moderate sensitivity (~80%) and specificity (~85%), they cannot definitively distinguish synucleinopathies from other parkinsonian or dementing disorders without pathological confirmation. Clinical misdiagnosis rates approach 15\u201325% in early disease (3). Thus, clinical diagnosis alone is insufficient for confirmation.\n\nOption B (Radiologically): Advanced neuroimaging modalities (e.g., dopamine transporter SPECT, cardiac MIBG scintigraphy, PET \u03b1-syn tracers under investigation) improve diagnostic accuracy but still lack the positive predictive value to serve as the definitive diagnostic test. For example, DaTscan offers ~85% sensitivity and ~80% specificity for PD vs. essential tremor but cannot definitively identify \u03b1-syn aggregates (4).\n\nOption D (Not applicable): This option is incorrect since there is an established gold standard. The only way to confirm synucleinopathy with maximal specificity and sensitivity is neuropathological examination, per current guidelines. No proposed substitute matches the diagnostic certainty of postmortem histopathology.","conceptual_foundation":"Synucleinopathies represent a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by misfolded \u03b1-synuclein protein aggregates. In the current ICD-11 classification, synucleinopathies fall under \u2018G20\u2013G23: Parkinson disease and other degenerative diseases of basal ganglia.\u2019 DSM-5-TR recognizes DLB under \u2018Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Lewy Body Disease.\u2019 Historically, James Parkinson first described parkinsonism in 1817, but the pathological hallmark\u2014Lewy bodies composed of \u03b1-syn\u2014was identified by Sch\u00f6rner and Lewy in the early 20th century. Classification has evolved from purely clinical subtypes to pathology-based entities, distinguishing PD, DLB, and MSA by the distribution of \u03b1-syn aggregates.\n\nEmbryologically, the substantia nigra pars compacta and other basal ganglia nuclei derive from the mesencephalic portion of the neural tube around week four of gestation, establishing dopaminergic pathways critical for motor control. \u03b1-Syn is a 140\u2013amino-acid presynaptic protein encoded by SNCA on chromosome 4q22.1. In health, \u03b1-syn regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking. In disease, misfolded \u03b1-syn forms \u03b2-sheet\u2013rich oligomers that aggregate into Lewy bodies (neuronal) or glial cytoplasmic inclusions (MSA).\n\nNeuroanatomically, synucleinopathies primarily affect dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, cholinergic nuclei in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, and cortical projection neurons in DLB. MSA involves oligodendroglial \u03b1-syn deposition in striatonigral and olivopontocerebellar pathways. Key neurotransmitter systems include dopamine, acetylcholine, and glutamate. Vascular supply to these regions (posterior cerebral artery branches for substantia nigra; anterior choroidal artery for basal ganglia) may modulate vulnerability. Differential considerations include tauopathies (progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTD).","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of \u03b1-syn involves regulation of synaptic vesicle endocytosis and neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals. Under stress, posttranslational modifications (phosphorylation at serine-129, nitration) favor misfolding. Misfolded \u03b1-syn oligomers propagate via a prion-like mechanism along interconnected neuronal pathways. Cellular mechanisms include impaired autophagy-lysosomal clearance, mitochondrial dysfunction with complex I inhibition, and oxidative stress (elevated reactive oxygen species). Microglial activation and neuroinflammation with release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 exacerbate neuronal injury.\n\nIn PD, initial \u03b1-syn accumulation in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and olfactory bulb (Braak stage 1) then advances rostrally through the brainstem to the substantia nigra (stages 3\u20134), manifesting motor symptoms. In DLB, cortical regions accumulate pathology earlier, correlating with early dementia. In MSA, oligodendrocyte inclusion formation leads to demyelination and neuronal loss in striatonigral and olivopontocerebellar systems. Genetic factors include SNCA multiplications and point mutations (A53T), LRRK2, GBA variants which modify \u03b1-syn handling.\n\nSymptomatically, dopaminergic neuronal loss leads to bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor. Cortical synucleinopathy underlies visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Secondary trophic failure leads to autonomic dysfunction in MSA, including orthostatic hypotension and urogenital impairment. Comparative pathophysiology: tauopathies exhibit tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles rather than \u03b1-syn inclusions, leading to different clinical and histological patterns.","clinical_manifestation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) typically presents after age 60 with asymmetric bradykinesia (96%), rigidity (80%), and resting tremor (65%). Nonmotor features include hyposmia (90%), REM sleep behavior disorder (50%), constipation (60%), and depression (35%). DLB presents with early cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations (80%), fluctuating cognition, parkinsonism (70%), and sensitivity to neuroleptics. MSA is subdivided into MSA-P (parkinsonian; 60% of cases) and MSA-C (cerebellar; 40%), with early autonomic failure\u2014orthostatic hypotension (75%), urinary incontinence (70%)\u2014and poor levodopa response (<20%).\n\nProdromal features span years: isolated REM sleep behavior disorder confers a 75% risk of conversion to a synucleinopathy within 10 years. Hyposmia has positive predictive value ~90% for developing PD when combined with other prodromes. Natural history: untreated PD progresses at an average Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) increase of 2.5 points/year. DLB median survival 5\u20137 years post-diagnosis; MSA median survival 6\u20139 years.\n\nDiagnostic criteria: MDS clinical PD criteria (2015) require bradykinesia plus rigidity or rest tremor, supportive criteria (e.g., response to levodopa). McKeith 2017 DLB consensus: two core features (visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations) or one core feature plus one suggestive feature (REM sleep behavior disorder, reduced DaT uptake). Controversies include the overlap between PD dementia and DLB if dementia onset occurs within one year of parkinsonism. Special populations: early-onset PD (<50 years) often have slower progression; juvenile synucleinopathies (rare SNCA mutations) can present in the third decade.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation begins with a detailed history and neurological exam applying MDS and McKeith criteria. Baseline labs (CBC, metabolic panel, thyroid function) rule out mimics. DaTscan SPECT is recommended (AAN level B) with sensitivity 88% and specificity 88% for parkinsonism vs. essential tremor; cardiac MIBG scintigraphy (level C) has sensitivity 85%, specificity 90% for DLB vs. Alzheimer\u2019s disease. MRI may show putaminal atrophy and \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign in MSA (specificity ~90%).\n\nSecond-tier tests include olfactory testing (UPSIT), polysomnography for REM sleep behavior disorder (sensitivity 98%, specificity 95%), and autonomic function testing. Emerging PET ligands for \u03b1-syn (under investigational protocols) offer promise but lack clinical validation. Genetic testing for SNCA, LRRK2, GBA mutations is indicated in familial cases or early onset.\n\nThird-tier diagnostics: skin or submandibular gland biopsy with \u03b1-syn immunohistochemistry shows aggregated \u03b1-syn in peripheral tissues (sensitivity 70%, specificity 100%) but remains research-level. Ultimately, definitive diagnosis still relies on postmortem neuropathology. Pretest probability stratification uses prodromal markers to guide testing algorithms. In resource-limited settings, clinical criteria and bedside autonomic tests may suffice to establish probable diagnosis pending confirmatory pathology.\n\nDiagnostic challenges include differentiating atypical parkinsonian syndromes (progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome) where tau rather than \u03b1-syn predominates. False-positive DaTscan results occur in drug-induced parkinsonism. Strategies include serial examinations, trial of levodopa, and multidisciplinary evaluation.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy for synucleinopathies; management is symptomatic. Levodopa remains first-line for PD motor symptoms (Class I, Level A), starting at 300\u2013600 mg/day divided doses with titration guided by motor fluctuations; NNT to achieve 30% improvement on UPDRS is 2.3. Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole) reduce daily \u201coff\u201d time by 1\u20132 hours (Level B). MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline) offer modest benefit (20% UPDRS improvement).\n\nDLB management includes cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, donepezil) to address cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Class II, Level B), with rivastigmine achieving 3-point MMSE improvement vs. placebo. Neuroleptics are contraindicated due to severe sensitivity. MSA autonomic failure is managed with fludrocortisone and midodrine for orthostatic hypotension, and intermittent catheterization for bladder dysfunction.\n\nSecond-tier treatments: deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus in PD reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias by 70% and improves quality of life (Class I, Level A). Apomorphine infusion provides rescue therapy for refractory \u201coff\u201d periods. Third-tier: investigational gene therapies targeting SNCA, immunotherapies (anti\u2013\u03b1-syn antibodies) in early-phase trials (Phase II). Nonpharmacological: tailored physical therapy, speech therapy for dysphagia and hypophonia, occupational therapy for activities of daily living, and cognitive rehabilitation in DLB.\n\nSpecial populations: reduce levodopa dosage in elderly to minimize dyskinesias; adjust for renal impairment in pramipexole; avoid anticholinergics in dementia. Multidisciplinary care including nursing and social work optimizes outcomes. Refractory cases may benefit from referral to specialized movement disorders centers for advanced therapies and clinical trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Routine follow-up every 3\u20136 months for stable PD; more frequent visits during titration or complication onset. Monitor motor scores (MDS-UPDRS), nonmotor scales (NMSS), cognitive (MoCA) and mood (GDS) assessments annually. Laboratory monitoring for COMT inhibitors (liver function) and levodopa (homocysteine levels) every 6\u201312 months. Imaging follow-up not routinely required unless atypical features emerge.\n\nLong-term care: anticipate motor fluctuations by year 5 in ~50% of patients, requiring advanced therapies. Surveillance for dyskinesias, orthostatic hypotension, and cognitive decline guides management adjustments. Transition to nursing home care may be needed when advanced dysphagia or falls become refractory. In MSA, follow autonomic parameters monthly early in disease; consider palliative care referrals by year 3\u20134.\n\nPrognostic factors include age at onset (younger onset = slower progression), presence of nonmotor symptoms (RBD confers rapid progression to dementia), and levodopa response (poor response suggests atypical parkinsonism). Predictive models integrating clinical and imaging data yield individualized prognoses. Regular cognitive screening in PD detects early PD dementia in ~30% by year 5. Patient education on \u201cred flags\u201d (acute visual hallucinations, rapid postural instability, dysphagia) prompts timely specialist referral. Multidisciplinary clinics enhance care continuity and reduce hospitalization rates by 30%.","clinical_pearls":"1. Neuropathology is the only definitive diagnostic modality for synucleinopathies\u2014clinical and imaging criteria remain supportive (high-yield for boards; 95% specificity postmortem confirmation).\n2. Prodromal features\u2014RBD, hyposmia, constipation\u2014precede motor symptoms by years; early recognition allows enrollment in neuroprotective trials (memory aid: \u201cOlfaction, Autonomic, Behavior = Early Synucleinopathy\u201d).\n3. DaTscan SPECT distinguishes presynaptic parkinsonism from essential tremor but cannot confirm \u03b1-synuclein aggregation; use in appropriate clinical context to avoid false positives.\n4. In DLB, severe neuroleptic sensitivity mandates avoidance of typical antipsychotics; choose cholinesterase inhibitors for cognitive and neuropsychiatric management to reduce hallucinations with minimal extrapyramidal side effects.\n5. MSA often presents with poor levodopa responsiveness and prominent autonomic failure\u2014presence of early orthostatic hypotension and urogenital dysfunction should raise suspicion of MSA-P over PD (board exam emphasis on early autonomic signs).","references":"1.

The treatment of choice for EA2 is acetazolamide (250\u20131000 mg/day) or 4-aminopyridine, neither of which appears among the options. Option A (Propranolol) is indicated for essential tremor (Level A evidence per AAN 2018) but does not reduce episodic ataxia attacks. Option B (Clonazepam) can modulate GABAergic tone and is used off-label for certain myokymias or tremor, but offers no robust clinical benefit in EA2 (no controlled trials). Option C (Lamotrigine) is an anticonvulsant without proven efficacy in EA2 and may worsen ataxia via sodium\u2010channel blockade.

Thus none of the provided treatments target the underlying P/Q\u2010type calcium channel dysfunction or effectively reduce attack frequency.","conceptual_foundation":"Episodic ataxias are rare autosomal dominant channelopathies characterized by paroxysmal cerebellar dysfunction. The two major types, EA1 (KCNA1 mutation) and EA2 (CACNA1A mutation), are classified in ICD-11 under 8A60.00 (Episodic ataxia 2). EA2 typically presents in childhood or early adulthood with recurrent attacks of vertigo, ataxia, and interictal myokymia. Differential diagnoses include vestibular migraine, multiple sclerosis, metabolic ataxias, and paroxysmal movement disorders. Historically, EA2 was described by Ziyeh et al. in 1997 as a distinct clinical entity linked to calcium channel gene mutations. Embryologically, CACNA1A gene expression in Purkinje cells arises from rhombencephalic developmental segments. Neuroanatomically, P/Q\u2010type calcium channels are abundant in cerebellar Purkinje and granule cells; afferent mossy and climbing fiber transmission depends on these channels for synaptic vesicle release. Clinically, EA2 links molecular genetics to episodic dysfunction of cerebellar output via deep cerebellar nuclei, manifesting as gait ataxia and vestibular symptoms.","pathophysiology":"Normal Purkinje cell pacemaking and synaptic integration depend on P/Q\u2010type (Cav2.1) voltage\u2010gated calcium channels encoded by CACNA1A. In EA2, missense or truncating CACNA1A mutations reduce channel open probability, impairing calcium influx at presynaptic terminals. This leads to episodic cerebellar disinhibition, erratic Purkinje cell firing, and transient cerebellar deep nuclear hyperactivity manifesting as ataxia and vertigo. Interictal peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (myokymia) arises from repolarization changes in motor axons due to altered channel kinetics. Acetazolamide\u2019s proposed mechanism\u2014mild metabolic acidosis\u2014enhances residual channel function and stabilizes neuronal excitability. In contrast, propranolol, clonazepam, lamotrigine, and DBS do not restore calcium channel function or correct aberrant Purkinje cell discharge patterns.","clinical_manifestation":"EA2 attacks typically last 30 minutes to several hours, triggered by stress, caffeine, or exertion, with complete interictal recovery. Symptoms include gait ataxia (90%), dysarthria (70%), vertigo (60%), and interictal myokymia (50%). Onset is often in the first two decades but can present in adulthood. Natural history shows reduction in attack frequency with age, though progressive interictal cerebellar atrophy may lead to persistent ataxia in some patients. Diagnostic criteria per Jen et al. 2004 require \u22652 attacks of ataxia/vertigo, EMG evidence of myokymia, and exclusion of other causes. Sensitivity of clinical criteria approaches 85% and specificity 90%. Atypical presentations may lack myokymia or have longer attacks (>24 h). Special populations\u2014children may exhibit more frequent attacks; pregnant patients tolerate acetazolamide with caution.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history, neurological examination focusing on ataxia and oculomotor function, and EMG to document myokymia (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~95%). Genetic testing for CACNA1A mutations is second-tier (yield 60\u201375% in familial cases). Brain MRI rules out structural lesions. Pre-test probability is high in familial cases (50% prior); a positive genetic test yields post-test probability >99%. Third-tier testing (e.g., functional calcium channel assays) remains research\u2010only. NNT to identify a mutation in sporadic adult-onset cases approaches 10. In resource-limited settings, a combination of clinical criteria and EMG may suffice to commence empiric therapy.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is acetazolamide 250\u2013500 mg BID, titrated to effect (NNT ~2 to achieve \u226550% reduction in attack frequency; Level B evidence). Monitor serum bicarbonate and electrolytes monthly. Second-line is 4\u2010aminopyridine 5\u201310 mg TID in refractory cases (Class IIa; improves attack frequency by ~60%). Avoid precipitants (caffeine, stress). Physical therapy can address interictal coordination deficits. No role for propranolol, clonazepam, lamotrigine, or DBS. Pregnancy: acetazolamide is Category C\u2014use lowest effective dose. Pediatric dosing is weight\u2010based, start at 5 mg/kg/day. In renal impairment, adjust dose; avoid in hepatic failure.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3\u20136 months initially to assess attack frequency and tolerability. Monitor electrolytes and bicarbonate quarterly. Annual neurologic exam and EMG if symptom pattern changes. Long-term acetazolamide beyond 5 years requires DEXA scan for bone density. Prognostic factors: earlier treatment initiation predicts better control; homozygous truncating mutations may lead to residual ataxia. Transition care to adult neurology by age 18. Relapse prevention focuses on continued therapy even after prolonged remission to avert rebound episodes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Episodic ataxia type 2 attacks resolve after sleep\u2014a key distinguishing feature from vestibular migraine. 2.

He has a history of dystonia, depression, chorea, and ataxia. There is no family history of a similar condition. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Dystonia","Anderson Disease","Neuroacanthocytosis","Parkinson's Disease"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Neuroacanthocytosis","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most correct answer is C: Neuroacanthocytosis. Neuroacanthocytosis syndromes (including chorea-acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome) present in childhood or early adulthood with movement disorders\u2014particularly chorea, dystonia, and ataxia\u2014alongside psychiatric manifestations such as depression and cognitive impairment. Atonic (negative myoclonus) jerks can occur in neuroacanthocytosis, reflecting basal ganglia and cortical involvement. There is often no family history in sporadic chorea-acanthocytosis due to autosomal recessive inheritance or de novo mutations. \n\nOption A (Dystonia) is too limited, as pure dystonia does not explain ataxia, chorea, or psychiatric symptoms. Option B (Anderson Disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type IIb) manifests with hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and muscle weakness, not chorea or dystonia. Option D (Parkinson\u2019s disease) typically presents after age 50 with bradykinesia, rigidity, rest tremor, and postural instability\u2014not atonic jerks or chorea\u2014and rarely has prominent psychiatric depression early in the disease. Thus, neuroacanthocytosis best accounts for the combination of atonic jerks, dystonia, chorea, ataxia, and depression in a young adult.","conceptual_foundation":"Neuroacanthocytosis syndromes are rare hereditary neurodegenerative disorders characterized by movement abnormalities and red blood cell acanthocytosis. In ICD-11, chorea-acanthocytosis is coded under 8A31.01 (other choreas) and McLeod syndrome under 8A30 (other neuroacanthocytosis). Differential diagnoses include Huntington\u2019s disease, Wilson\u2019s disease, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), and primary dystonias. Historically, the term \"neuroacanthocytosis\" was coined in the 1970s when acanthocytes were first observed on peripheral smear in choreiform disorders. Embryologically, basal ganglia derive from the telencephalon; mutations in VPS13A (chorea-acanthocytosis) or XK (McLeod) disrupt neuronal vesicle trafficking and membrane stability. The basal ganglia\u2013thalamocortical circuits involved include the direct and indirect pathways, mediated by GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. Dopaminergic modulation from the substantia nigra pars compacta is altered, leading to hyperkinetic movements. The blood supply involves the lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery. Genetically, VPS13A encodes chorein; loss-of-function leads to membrane trafficking deficits, while XK gene mutations cause the McLeod blood group phenotype and neurodegeneration.  ","pathophysiology":"Normal motor control depends on balanced basal ganglia direct (facilitatory) and indirect (inhibitory) pathways. In chorea-acanthocytosis, VPS13A mutations cause chorein deficiency, leading to neuronal membrane instability, disrupted autophagy, and neuroinflammation. Loss of medium spiny neuron function in the striatum diminishes indirect pathway inhibition, resulting in excessive thalamocortical excitation manifesting as chorea and atonic jerks. Dystonia arises from abnormal inhibitory output from the internal globus pallidus, altering sensorimotor integration. Depression and psychiatric features relate to limbic circuit dysfunction. Pathologically, there is striatal atrophy, gliosis, and neuronal loss. In contrast, Parkinson\u2019s disease features nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron loss, Anderson disease involves lysosomal glycogen accumulation, and primary dystonias often involve DYT gene mutations without widespread neuronal loss.","clinical_manifestation":"Chorea-acanthocytosis commonly presents in the second to fourth decade with chorea (90%), orofacial dyskinesias (lip- and tongue-biting), neck and trunk dystonia, and gait ataxia. Atonic myoclonus occurs in ~30%. Psychiatric manifestations (depression, obsessive\u2013compulsive behaviors) occur in >50%. Cognitive decline is variable. Acanthocytes are present in peripheral blood smear (~70\u201390%). McLeod syndrome features late-onset chorea, peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and elevated creatine kinase. Natural history shows progressive disability over 10\u201320 years. Diagnostic criteria include movement disorder plus acanthocytosis and absence of chorein on Western blot. Wilson\u2019s disease must be excluded (normal ceruloplasmin).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier tests: peripheral blood smear for acanthocytes (sensitivity ~0.7); creatine kinase (elevated in ~80%); neuroimaging (MRI shows caudate head atrophy). Second-tier: Western blot for chorein deficiency (specificity ~0.95); genetic testing for VPS13A mutations (gold standard, sensitivity ~0.99). Third-tier: muscle biopsy (rarely needed). Pre-test probability is high with characteristic movement disorder and acanthocytosis. Differential includes Huntington\u2019s (HTT gene test), Wilson\u2019s (ceruloplasmin, 24-hr copper), NBIA (iron deposition on MRI).","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists. Symptomatic treatments include tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine for chorea (Class II, Level B evidence), botulinum toxin for focal dystonia (Class I, Level A), antipsychotics for behavioral issues, and physical therapy for gait. Seizures managed with standard antiepileptics. Deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS) may improve dystonia and chorea (Class III). Supportive care focuses on nutrition, wound care for self-injury, and psychiatric support.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular neurologic assessments every 6\u201312 months with evaluation of movement severity (Unified Huntington\u2019s Disease Rating Scale adapted), psychiatric screening, and cardiac monitoring (in McLeod). Laboratory: CK every 6 months. MRI every 2\u20133 years to monitor atrophy. Multidisciplinary care with neurology, psychiatry, physical therapy, and social work.","clinical_pearls":"1. Acanthocytes on smear in a young adult with chorea and dystonia strongly suggest neuroacanthocytosis. 2. Orofacial self-mutilation (lip and tongue biting) is virtually pathognomonic for chorea-acanthocytosis. 3. VPS13A gene testing confirms the diagnosis (>98% sensitivity). 4. Tetrabenazine can reduce chorea but may worsen depression\u2014use with caution. 5. GPi-DBS provides symptomatic relief of dystonia and chorea in refractory cases.","references":"1.
