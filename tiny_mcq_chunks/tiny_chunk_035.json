Multiple randomized controlled trials and pooled analyses demonstrate that early hemicraniectomy performed within 48 hours of symptom onset reduces mortality from approximately 80% to 50% and increases the proportion of survivors with favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale \u22644). No alternative surgical or medical option has shown comparable benefit. There are no other options provided; thus, decompressive craniectomy remains the single correct management step in this scenario.","conceptual_foundation":"Malignant MCA infarction describes a large territory ischemic stroke involving the full MCA distribution, leading to rapid cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and risk of herniation. In the ICD-11, this falls under NA91.2. The nosology has evolved from descriptive syndrome labels (\u2018space-occupying infarction\u2019) to well\u2010defined protocols for early surgical intervention. Embryologically, the MCA arises from the stapedial artery complex (branch of the internal carotid), supplying lateral cerebral cortex and deep perforators. Anatomically, infarction of the proximal MCA affects Broca\u2019s area, motor cortex, and internal capsule via lenticulostriate branches. The resulting cytotoxic and vasogenic edema follows the classic Monro\u2013Kellie doctrine pathophysiology. Differential diagnoses include large posterior cerebral infarction and space-occupying hemorrhage; management differs substantially.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, autoregulation maintains cerebral blood flow despite perfusion pressure fluctuations. In malignant MCA stroke, large\u2010vessel occlusion causes cytotoxic edema from failure of Na+/K+ ATPase, leading to neuronal swelling and extracellular fluid accumulation. This raises intracranial pressure, decreases cerebral perfusion pressure, triggers vasogenic edema via blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown, and sets off inflammatory cascades (upregulation of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1). Progressive midline shift compresses contralateral structures, risks transtentorial herniation, and causes brainstem compression. Decompressive craniectomy disrupts the rigid cranial vault, allowing the edematous hemisphere to expand outward, normalizing intracranial pressure and preserving brainstem function.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with malignant MCA infarction present within 24\u201348 hours of stroke onset with hemiparesis/hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, aphasia (if dominant hemisphere), and a declining level of consciousness due to intracranial hypertension. Headache, nausea, and vomiting may accompany rising intracranial pressure. On examination, an ipsilateral dilated pupil may herald uncal herniation. Without surgical intervention, the natural history is rapid neurological deterioration over 2\u20135 days, with >70% mortality by day 7.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial non-contrast CT confirms a large MCA territory hypodensity with early signs of edema (loss of gray\u2013white differentiation, sulcal effacement) and midline shift >5 mm. CT angiography identifies vessel occlusion; CT perfusion defines penumbra. MRI DWI can detail infarct core but is less practical in unstable patients. Serial imaging every 12\u201324 hours assesses edema progression. Prognostic models (e.g., Hijdra score) may aid risk stratification but do not replace the indication for decompression.","management_principles":"Per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level A evidence), decompressive hemicraniectomy is recommended in patients \u226460 years with space-occupying MCA infarction within 48 hours. The surgical procedure entails removal of a large bone flap (12 \u00d7 15 cm) and duraplasty. Medical management includes head elevation, sedation, hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol or hypertonic saline), normothermia, and careful blood pressure control. Blood glucose should be maintained between 140\u2013180 mg/dL. In patients >60 years, hemicraniectomy has a Class IIa recommendation based on DECIMAL and DESTINY II trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative care in a neurocritical care unit includes intracranial pressure monitoring, serial neurological examinations, and repeat CT at 24\u201348 hours. Cranioplasty is typically performed 6\u201312 weeks after decompression once cerebral edema subsides. Early mobilization and multidisciplinary rehabilitation (physical, occupational, speech therapies) should commence within days of surgery. Long-term follow-up includes monitoring for complications: hydrocephalus, syndrome of the trephined, seizures, and neurocognitive deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early hemicraniectomy (within 48 h) halves mortality in malignant MCA strokes; do not delay. 2.

What is the recommended treatment?","options":["Aspirin","Warfarin","PFO closure","Aspirin and Plavix"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Aspirin","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"Option Analysis":"Choice A (Aspirin) is the preferred initial therapy for secondary prevention in a patient with a lacunar infarct involving the internal capsule and uncontrolled hypertension. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 in platelets, reducing thromboxane A2 formation and preventing platelet aggregation. Clinical trials (e.g., CAPRIE, IST) demonstrate aspirin\u2019s efficacy in small vessel stroke with a favorable safety profile. Choice B (Warfarin) is reserved for cardioembolic sources such as atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves; it carries a higher bleeding risk without additional benefit in small non-cardioembolic ischemic strokes. Choice C (PFO closure) may be indicated in patients younger than 60 with cryptogenic stroke after thorough evaluation and absence of alternative mechanisms; uncontrolled hypertension and lacunar infarction indicate a small vessel etiology rather than paradoxical embolism, making closure less beneficial and more invasive. Choice D (Aspirin and Plavix) is supported for 21 days in minor stroke or high-risk TIA per CHANCE and POINT trials but is not recommended long term due to increased hemorrhage without added benefit beyond three weeks in lacunar syndromes. Therefore, single-agent antiplatelet therapy with aspirin is the correct recommendation, along with aggressive blood pressure management.","Conceptual Foundation":"The internal capsule is a white matter structure through which corticospinal, corticobulbar, and corticopontine fibers traverse. Its anterior limb carries frontopontine fibers, while the genu contains corticobulbar tracts; the posterior limb harbors corticospinal fibers destined for contralateral limbs and sensory thalamocortical projections. Lacunar infarctions in the posterior limb produce pure motor hemiparesis, often sparing cortical functions (speech, cognition). The deep perforating lenticulostriate arteries, branches of the middle cerebral artery, supply this region and are vulnerable to lipohyalinosis from chronic hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Neurologically, damage to corticospinal fibers results in upper motor neuron signs\u2014spasticity, hyperreflexia, and a Babinski sign. Understanding this anatomy clarifies why small vessel pathology causes discrete syndromes. Related conditions include pontine lacunes (dysarthria\u2013clumsy hand syndrome) and thalamic lacunes (pure sensory stroke). Recognizing the vascular territory and mechanism directs targeted prevention and guides acute management strategies in vascular neurology board review.","Pathophysiology":"Lacunar infarcts stem from occlusion of small penetrating arterioles due to lipohyalinosis and microatheroma formation. Chronic hypertension induces hyaline deposition in vessel walls, narrowing lumens and increasing susceptibility to thrombotic occlusion. Endothelial dysfunction triggers inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) that upregulate adhesion molecules, promoting leukocyte adherence and further vessel wall injury. Reactive oxygen species from NADPH oxidase exacerbate lipid peroxidation. At a molecular level, decreased nitric oxide bioavailability compromises vasodilation, while endothelin overexpression enhances vasoconstriction. Genetic predispositions, such as polymorphisms in the NOTCH3 gene, can influence small vessel disease, though most lacunes are sporadic. Demyelination and gliosis follow ischemia, leading to gliotic scar formation visible on T2-weighted MRI as hyperintense foci. No significant excitotoxicity or reperfusion injury occurs compared with cortical strokes. These microvascular events reflect the intersection of hemodynamic stress, vascular remodeling, and low-grade inflammation characteristic of hypertensive small vessel ischemic disease.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients with an internal capsule lacunar stroke present acutely with contralateral pure motor hemiparesis affecting face, arm, and leg without cortical signs (aphasia, visual field cuts, neglect). On examination, strength is reduced (Medical Research Council grade 2\u20134/5), tone is increased, reflexes are brisk, and Babinski sign is present. Sensory function remains intact, distinguishing from thalamic lacunes. Onset is often rapid, reaching maximal deficit within hours, and remains stable thereafter. Variations include dysarthria\u2013clumsy hand syndrome when pontine perforators are involved. Prognosis is generally favorable: many regain independent ambulation within weeks. However, uncontrolled hypertension portends recurrent lacunes and vascular cognitive impairment. Early motor recovery correlates with diffusion-weighted MRI lesion size (<15 mm) and absence of white matter hyperintensities on FLAIR. Functional outcome scales (modified Rankin Scale) at three months predict long-term disability. Recognizing this presentation ensures prompt targeted therapy and secondary prevention to reduce recurrence risk.","Diagnostic Approach":"Initial evaluation starts with noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, followed by MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging to confirm acute lacune in the internal capsule. MR angiography assesses large vessel patency; carotid duplex rules out high-grade stenosis. Echocardiography (transthoracic and bubble study) identifies patent foramen ovale and cardiac sources of emboli, although a PFO in the presence of hypertension and lacunar pattern likely represents incidental finding. Continuous cardiac monitoring (Holter or telemetry) for 24\u201348 hours excludes paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Laboratory workup includes fasting lipid profile, hemoglobin A1c, inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) to assess risk factors. Differential diagnoses include acute demyelinating lesions, mild intracerebral hemorrhages, or metabolic hemiparesis. Neurovascular ultrasound may detect microemboli but is not routine. The combination of lacunar pattern on MRI, uncontrolled hypertension, and absence of high-risk cardioembolic features supports small vessel pathology as the stroke mechanism, guiding appropriate management.","Management Principles":"Acute management includes blood pressure control (target systolic 140\u2013160 mm Hg acutely, then <130/80 mm Hg chronically), initiated with intravenous labetalol or nicardipine, transitioning to oral antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors, thiazides). Secondary prevention mandates single-agent antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily. Statin therapy (atorvastatin 40\u201380 mg) is indicated for LDL targets <70 mg/dL. Glycemic control and lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, smoking cessation) mitigate progression of small vessel disease. Dual antiplatelet therapy is limited to 21 days post minor stroke, not indefinitely. Warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants are contraindicated absent atrial fibrillation or large cardioembolic sources. Monitor liver function and platelet count with statins and antiplatelets. Contraindications include active bleeding or aspirin allergy; consider clopidogrel 75 mg daily if aspirin intolerant. Non-pharmacological interventions include supervised physical and occupational therapy to maximize motor recovery and prevent contractures.","Follow-up Guidelines":"Follow-up visits are scheduled at two weeks, three months, and six months. Blood pressure should be monitored weekly until stable, then quarterly. MRI may be repeated at six months if new symptoms arise. Assess for recurrent TIA or stroke signs and adjust therapy accordingly. Lipid panels and HbA1c are rechecked every six months. Lifestyle adherence and medication compliance are reinforced through motivational interviewing. Long-term complications include vascular cognitive impairment and recurrent lacunar infarcts; screen annually for cognitive decline using the Mini-Mental State Examination or Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Educate patients on symptom recognition and the importance of blood pressure logs. Referral to hypertension specialists or multidisciplinary stroke prevention clinics can optimize risk factor control and prevent further small vessel damage over time.","Clinical Pearls":"1. Lacunar infarcts often lack cortical signs; pure motor strokes suggest internal capsule involvement. 2. Chronic uncontrolled hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor driving lipohyalinosis in perforating arterioles. 3. PFO closure is indicated only in select cryptogenic strokes under age 60 without alternate etiologies; incidental PFOs in lacunar strokes do not warrant closure. 4. Dual antiplatelet therapy beyond 21 days increases hemorrhagic risk without added benefit in small vessel disease. 5. MRI diffusion-weighted imaging is the gold standard to confirm lacunar infarct size and location. 6. Aggressive BP control (<130/80 mm Hg) reduces recurrence of lacunar events. 7. Always exclude atrial fibrillation with extended cardiac monitoring before ruling out anticoagulation. 8. Statins confer plaque stabilization and anti-inflammatory effects beyond lipid lowering.","References":"1. Sacco RL, et al. Lacunar stroke. N Engl J Med. 1998;339(17):1217\u201324.

What should be done regarding his blood pressure?","options":["No management","Oral amlodipine","IV labetalol","IV nicardipine"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"No management","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A \u2013 No blood pressure lowering: This is the correct approach in a patient presenting more than six hours after symptom onset with systolic blood pressure under 220 mm Hg and diastolic under 120 mm Hg. Permissive hypertension up to 220/120 mm Hg is supported to maintain collateral perfusion and penumbral viability. The 2018 AHA/ASA Acute Ischemic Stroke Guidelines recommend no acute BP reduction in such scenarios (per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines). Clinically, patients who present late without indications for thrombolysis benefit from higher perfusion pressures to reduce infarct expansion. Common misconceptions include an assumption that every hypertensive stroke patient requires immediate treatment; in fact, aggressive lowering can worsen ischemia. Several observational studies report up to 15% increased infarct growth when BP is lowered prematurely at this stage.\n\nOption B \u2013 Oral amlodipine: Oral dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine 5\u201310 mg daily) are rarely indicated acutely in ischemic stroke unless hypertension >220/120 mm Hg persists beyond 24 hours or if there is coexistent hypertensive emergency affecting other organs. In chronic outpatient management, amlodipine reduces stroke recurrence by 20% over five years but has no role in acute permissive hypertension (for chronic stroke prevention per JNC 8, 2014). Initiating oral amlodipine in the acute setting risks dropping cerebral perfusion pressure.\n\nOption C \u2013 IV labetalol: Intravenous labetalol (10\u201320 mg bolus, repeat every 10\u201320 minutes to a maximum of 300 mg or continuous infusion at 2\u20138 mg/min) is indicated when acute systolic BP exceeds 185 mm Hg prior to IV tPA administration, or when hypertensive emergency threatens end-organ damage (per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines). In cases of intracerebral hemorrhage or before tPA, rapid lowering to <185/110 mm Hg is required. In our late-presenting scenario with no thrombolytic indication and BP below 220/120 mm Hg, labetalol would unnecessarily reduce perfusion.\n\nOption D \u2013 IV nicardipine: Continuous infusion of nicardipine (starting 5 mg/hr, titrating up by 2.5 mg/hr every 5\u201315 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/hr) is preferred in acute hypertensive emergencies to allow tight control (per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines). It is indicated when BP >220/120 mm Hg or when preparing for endovascular therapy or tPA. Initiating nicardipine in a stable, late-presenting ischemic stroke patient risks exceeding autoregulatory capacity, leading to infarct exacerbation. While nicardipine achieves smooth reductions, it is not indicated here.\n\nPathophysiological basis: In acute ischemic stroke, cerebral autoregulation is impaired in the penumbra. Permissive hypertension sustains collateral flow. Rapid BP reduction below the lower limit of autoregulation (~140 mm Hg) increases infarct volume by an average of 30% (observational cohort data). Thus, Option A is definitively correct, avoiding iatrogenic worsening of ischemia.","conceptual_foundation":"The acute ischemic stroke involves occlusion of a cerebral artery\u2014commonly the middle cerebral artery (MCA) \u2013 leading to ischemia in the corresponding cortical and subcortical regions including the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus), somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus), and adjacent white matter tracts (internal capsule). Embryologically, these vessels derive from the cranial portion of the dorsal aorta, with the primitive internal carotid network forming by the 6th week of gestation. Normal physiology relies on tight autoregulation between 50 and 150 mm Hg mean arterial pressure (MAP), mediated by myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms in the arteriolar smooth muscle and perivascular nerves. In acute stroke, local autoregulation is abolished in the core, partially maintained in the penumbra, demanding higher systemic pressure to drive collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomoses.\n\nHistorical perspectives date back to Cushing\u2019s descriptions of cerebral perfusion in the early 20th century. The concept of permissive hypertension emerged in the 1970s when animal models demonstrated that maintaining systolic pressure above 180 mm Hg limited infarct growth. Key anatomic landmarks include the Sylvian fissure (dividing frontal and temporal lobes), the lenticulostriate branches from the MCA supplying the basal ganglia, and the watershed zones at the junction of anterior and middle cerebral artery territories. Clinical significance arises when deficits such as contralateral hemiparesis or hemisensory loss map precisely to MCA distribution. Recognition of these structures guides imaging protocols\u2014CT angiography focusing on the circle of Willis and diffusion-weighted MRI identifying penumbral tissue under perfusion-diffusion mismatch algorithms.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, acute ischemic stroke begins with energy failure when ATP-dependent Na+/K+ ATPases cease function within seconds of arterial occlusion. Neuronal depolarization releases glutamate into the synaptic cleft, overactivating NMDA and AMPA receptors, leading to calcium influx and activation of calcium-dependent enzymes (proteases, lipases, endonucleases). This excitotoxic cascade results in cell membrane breakdown and necrosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial permeability transition pores amplify injury. Genetically, variants in the MTHFR gene (C677T polymorphism) increase homocysteine levels, predisposing to endothelial dysfunction, while NOTCH3 mutations cause CADASIL with recurrent lacunar infarcts.\n\nInflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9) degrade the blood\u2013brain barrier, promoting vasogenic edema and hemorrhagic transformation. Microglial activation peaks at 24\u201372 hours, releasing further cytokines. Metabolically, anaerobic glycolysis generates lactic acid, lowering pH and contributing to neuronal death. The time course: core infarction within minutes, penumbra salvageable up to six hours, but evolving oligemia may persist for 24 hours in select patients. Compensatory collateral recruitment provides partial perfusion but is limited by high vascular resistance and endothelial dysfunction\u2014hence the rationale for permissive hypertension. However, unopposed BP elevation beyond 220/120 mm Hg risks hemorrhagic conversion due to weakened vessel walls and MMP-mediated basement membrane breakdown.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset is abrupt, peaking within minutes: focal weakness, speech disturbance, visual field cuts. A typical timeline: minutes\u2013hours \u2013 maximal deficit; hours\u2013days \u2013 risk of progression; days\u2013weeks \u2013 stabilization and edema peak at 3\u20135 days. Neurological exam reveals contralateral upper motor neuron signs: spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign; cortical signs such as aphasia for dominant hemisphere infarcts; neglect in nondominant lesions. Sensory deficits follow motor patterns due to involvement of postcentral gyrus and thalamocortical projections.\n\nAge variations: pediatric strokes often present with seizures (30% incidence) and nonfocal signs, while elderly patients may have more subtle confusion or delirium. Gender differences: women report more severe headaches and nausea. Associated systemic features include elevated blood pressure (seen in up to 80%); hyperglycemia in 30% correlates with worse outcomes. Severity scales: NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores correlate strongly with infarct volume and prognosis; a score >16 predicts 90-day mortality near 60%. Red flags include sudden headache, vomiting, decreased consciousness suggesting hemorrhagic transformation. Without treatment, natural history indicates 50% of untreated MCA strokes result in severe disability or death at 30 days, with 10% risk of recurrence within three months.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Immediate noncontrast head CT within 20 minutes to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 95%, specificity 100% for acute hemorrhage) per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines. Step 2: CT angiography of head and neck to identify large vessel occlusion (sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%) per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines. Step 3: CT perfusion or MR perfusion-diffusion mismatch to quantify penumbra vs core infarct (per ESO-ESMINT 2019 Recommendations). Step 4: Laboratory tests: CBC (normal WBC 4\u201311 \u00d710^9/L), INR (target <1.7 if considering tPA), serum glucose (ideal 140\u2013180 mg/dL) per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines; electrolytes and renal function for contrast administration (normal creatinine 0.6\u20131.3 mg/dL). Step 5: Electrocardiogram and continuous telemetry to detect atrial fibrillation (per ESC 2020 Guidelines). Step 6: Transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble study if cardioembolism suspected (per AHA/ASA 2019 Guidelines). Step 7: Carotid duplex ultrasound for stenosis >50% in symptomatic carotid disease (per SVS 2017 Guidelines).

Each investigation is ordered based on initial CT findings and potential interventions.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Permissive hypertension up to 220/120 mm Hg\u2014no antihypertensive therapy acutely in late-presenting ischemic stroke (per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines). Tier 2 (Second-line): If systolic BP >220 or diastolic >120 mm Hg, initiate IV nicardipine infusion starting at 5 mg/hr, titrating by 2.5 mg/hr every 5 minutes to target BP <220/120 mm Hg (per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines). Tier 3 (Third-line): For refractory cases or labile pressures despite nicardipine, add IV labetalol infusion at 2 mg/min, adjusting to achieve target within 1 hour (per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines).\n\nNon-pharmacological: Head elevation 30\u00b0, maintain euvolemia (fluids isotonic saline 1\u20131.5 mL/kg/hr) to optimize cerebral perfusion (per WSO 2021 Consensus).

Superior cerebellar artery (SCA) infarction classically produces cerebellar hemisphere signs due to ischemia of the superior portion of the cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei. Multiple studies, including Kim JS (Neurology, 2010), have demonstrated that limb and truncal ataxia occur in approximately 80\u201390% of SCA infarcts, making ataxia the most common presenting neurologic deficit. Option B: Vertigo may occur in cerebellar infarction but is more characteristic of PICA (posterior inferior cerebellar artery) or AICA (anterior inferior cerebellar artery) infarcts where vestibular nuclei or labyrinthine connections are involved; vertigo is reported in only 30\u201340% of SCA strokes (Schmahmann JD, Brain, 2000). Option C: Nystagmus can be seen in cerebellar lesions but is a non-specific finding and occurs less frequently (20\u201330%) in isolated SCA infarction (Schmahmann JD, 2000). Option D: Dysarthria is a feature of cerebellar strokes but is secondary to ataxia of bulbar musculature and occurs in about 50\u201360% of SCA infarcts (Kim JS, 2010), making it less common than ataxia.","conceptual_foundation":"An in-depth understanding of SCA infarction begins with cerebellar vascular anatomy. The cerebellum receives blood from three pairs of arteries: the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), and the superior cerebellar artery (SCA). The SCA arises from the distal basilar artery just below its bifurcation into the posterior cerebral arteries. It supplies the superior cerebellar hemispheres, dentate nucleus, superior vermis, and superior cerebellar peduncle. In the current ICD-11 classification, cerebellar infarctions are coded under 8B41.Y cerebrovascular diseases affecting the cerebellum. In the TOAST classification, etiology is often large artery atherosclerosis involving the basilar artery or cardioembolism. Embryologically, the SCA develops from the rostral division of the longitudinal neural artery with contributions from the circumferential metencephalic arteries. Afferent fibers enter via the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles, while Purkinje cells project inhibitory outputs to the deep nuclei and ultimately to the red nucleus and thalamus. Lesions produce ipsilateral deficits due to the double-crossing of cerebellar efferents. Key related conditions include demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis, cerebellar tumors, and degenerative ataxias.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the SCA delivers oxygenated blood to Purkinje cell layers, granule cells, and the deep cerebellar nuclei, enabling coordination by fine-tuning cortical motor signals. Occlusion leads to ischemia, energy failure, and ion pump dysfunction within minutes, resulting in cytotoxic edema of Purkinje neurons and disruption of inhibitory GABAergic outputs to the deep nuclei. The subsequent excitotoxic cascade involves excessive glutamate release, calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reactive oxygen species generation. Within the superior vermis, loss of Purkinje-mediated inhibition of the fastigial nucleus leads to truncal ataxia, while hemisphere infarction impairs limb coordination via the dentate nucleus pathway to the motor cortex. Collateral flow from AICA or PICA may be transiently protective but often insufficient, resulting in infarct expansion. Microvascular inflammation and platelet aggregation further propagate vessel occlusion. Over time, gliotic scar formation replaces necrotic tissue, permanently disrupting neural circuits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with SCA infarction typically present acutely with ipsilateral limb ataxia, gait instability, dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia. In a cohort study by Kim JS (2010), 88% exhibited limb ataxia, 72% truncal ataxia, 56% dysarthria, 34% nystagmus, and 28% vertigo. Gait ataxia manifests as a wide-based, unsteady gait often requiring assistance. Truncal ataxia leads to difficulty sitting without support. Dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing are hallmark signs. Nystagmus, when present, is gaze-evoked and ipsipultal. Vertigo tends to be less severe than in PICA strokes. Dysarthria presents as scanning speech due to incoordination of bulbar muscles. Without reperfusion therapy, large cerebellar infarcts may lead to edema, fourth ventricle compression, hydrocephalus, and herniation, with mortality up to 25% (Dorsch NW et al., 2017).","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic workup begins with non-contrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage and large masses (sensitivity ~60% for acute posterior fossa infarcts). MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has sensitivity ~95% and specificity ~98% for acute cerebellar infarction within 24 hours (AHA/ASA 2018). CT angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA) evaluate vessel patency; CTA sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95%. Transcranial Doppler can detect flow deficits in basilar and SCA vessels. Cardiac monitoring (ECG, telemetry) and echocardiography (TEE sensitivity ~90%) assess embolic sources. Laboratory tests include CBC, coagulation profile, lipid panel, and glucose. A stroke code with door-to-needle time <60 minutes is recommended (Class I, Level A). Perfusion imaging may guide endovascular therapy decisions beyond 4.5 hours.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines: intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) within 4.5 hours (Class I, Level A) and endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions within 6 hours (Class I, Level A). BP should be maintained <180/105 mmHg during and after thrombolysis. Aspirin (162\u2013325 mg) initiated 24\u201348 hours post-stroke reduces recurrence by 22% (CAST trial). High-intensity statin therapy is recommended regardless of baseline LDL (Class I). In cases of cerebellar swelling with clinical deterioration, suboccipital decompressive craniectomy is life-saving (Class I). Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation focusing on balance, gait training, and coordination improves functional outcomes (Neurorehabil Neural Repair, 2016).","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-discharge, patients should have neurology follow-up at 2 weeks, 3 months, and annually. BP monitoring weekly for 1 month, then monthly until target <140/90 mmHg. Lipid profile at 4\u201312 weeks post-stroke. Carotid or transcranial Doppler at 3 months to assess stenosis. Secondary prevention includes short-term dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke or high-risk TIA, followed by monotherapy (POINT trial). In atrial fibrillation, direct oral anticoagulants reduce recurrence by 60% (ROCKET AF trial). Structured education, lifestyle modification, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation decrease 1-year recurrence risk to 5%.","clinical_pearls":"1. Ipsilateral limb ataxia is the hallmark of SCA infarction: \"I-P-L-Ataxia\" mnemonic (Ipsilateral Purkinje Loss). 2. Vertigo and nausea occur in <30% of pure SCA strokes; consider PICA/AICA if prominent. 3. MRI-DWI is essential when CT is negative\u2014posterior fossa infarcts are missed in up to 40% on CT. 4. Monitor for cerebellar edema and hydrocephalus with large infarcts; suboccipital decompression may be required. 5. High-intensity statins and antiplatelet therapy are critical for secondary prevention; aim for BP <140/90 mmHg and LDL <70 mg/dL.","references":"1.
