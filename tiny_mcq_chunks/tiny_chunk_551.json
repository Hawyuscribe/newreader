MRI of the spine (\u224855 words): Spinal MRI is indicated when patients present with myelopathic signs, limb weakness, sensory level, bladder dysfunction, or longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). In a scenario with paraparesis or Baclofen\u2010responsive spasms and T2\u2010hyperintense lesions spanning \u22653 vertebral segments, spinal imaging is essential. However, isolated diencephalic hypersomnia without motor or sensory deficits makes spinal MRI low yield.\n\nB. AQP4 antibody test (\u224875 words): Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) may involve periventricular and diencephalic nuclei, causing refractory hypersomnia. Aquaporin-4 IgG testing has 75\u201390% sensitivity and >95% specificity. In Wingerchuk\u2019s 2015 revised criteria, diencephalic MRI lesions plus hypersomnolence meet NMOSD diagnostic flags. Positive AQP4 confirms autoimmune astrocytopathy and guides immunotherapy. Misconceptions: confusing narcolepsy\u2019s PFH loss with diencephalic inflammatory lesions delays immunologic testing.\n\nC. Lumbar puncture (\u224850 words): CSF analysis is vital in suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) or infectious encephalitis (elevated oligoclonal bands in 85% of MS, pleocytosis >50 cells/mm3 in viral meningitis). But pure sleep\u2010wake disturbance without fever, headache, or focal signs rarely yields diagnostic cell counts or oligoclonals that change management as directly as AQP4 serology in NMOSD.\n\nD. Sleep study (\u224850 words): Polysomnography is first-line in suspected OSA, narcolepsy, or idiopathic hypersomnia (Multiple Sleep Latency Test with mean latency <8\u2009min, SOREMPs). Here, structural diencephalic lesions on MRI point to secondary hypersomnia. A sleep lab won\u2019t detect aquaporin-4\u2013mediated astrocytopathy or guide immunosuppression, so it isn\u2019t definitive.","conceptual_foundation":"The diencephalon consists of the thalamus, hypothalamus, epithalamus, and subthalamus. The hypothalamic lateral and posterior nuclei regulate wakefulness via orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, while the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus promotes sleep by inhibitory GABAergic output. Embryologically, the diencephalon arises from prosencephalon (forebrain vesicle) by week 5. Thalamic relay nuclei (e.g., dorsomedial nucleus) project to prefrontal cortex, integrating arousal and cognition. Damage to midline thalamic\u2013hypothalamic circuits, for instance in Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy or NMOSD, disrupts orexin and histamine pathways, causing hypersomnolence. Historical context: von Economo first described encephalitis lethargica (1917) affecting these regions; subsequent neuroanatomical mapping by Brodal (1950s) localized sleep\u2013wake regulation. Key landmarks in diencephalic imaging: the third ventricle lateral walls (thalamic nuclei), mamillary bodies (posterior hypothalamus), and interthalamic adhesion. Recognition of periventricular and hypothalamic T2 hyperintensities is clinically significant in differentiating secondary narcolepsy from idiopathic forms.","pathophysiology":"In NMOSD, autoantibodies target aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels on astrocyte foot processes, especially abundant in the periventricular diencephalon. Binding of IgG1 AQP4\u2013Ab activates complement cascade (C1q, C3b deposition), leading to membrane attack complex formation and astrocyte lysis. Microglial activation releases IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and nitric oxide, further damaging neurons and oligodendrocytes secondarily. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DRB1*03:01 in 30\u201340% of Caucasian NMOSD patients. Pathological changes evolve over days to weeks: initial BBB disruption, astrocyte loss within 48\u201372\u2009hours, then demyelination and axonal transection by day 7. Compensatory upregulation of AQP1 in ependyma is insufficient to restore fluid homeostasis, perpetuating edema and lesion expansion. Mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes reduces lactate shuttle to neurons, impairing local energy metabolism. Thus, diencephalic lesions disrupt orexinergic and cholinergic arousal systems, clinically manifesting as hypersomnia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop progressive hypersomnolence over 2\u20134 weeks, with total sleep time exceeding 16\u2009hours/day, and sleep attacks lasting 30\u2013120\u2009minutes. Examination reveals poor arousal, vertical gaze palsy if the rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF is involved, and autonomic dysregulation (thermoregulatory instability in 20\u201330%). In adults, median age of onset is 35\u2009years; pediatric cases often show severe diencephalic syndrome with failure to thrive. Females account for 70\u201380% of NMOSD with diencephalic involvement. Use of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (>16 suggests pathological sleepiness) and Stanford Sleepiness Scale guides severity grading. Associated systemic signs include area postrema syndrome in 40% (intractable hiccups, nausea), optic neuritis in 50\u201360%, and LETM in 50%. Without treatment, natural history entails relapse median interval 8\u2009months, accumulating disability from recurrent attacks.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Brain MRI with 3T scanner, using FLAIR, T2, and contrast\u2010enhanced T1 sequences. Diencephalic T2 hyperintensity periependymal to third ventricle suggests NMOSD (sensitivity 60%, specificity 90%).\nStep 2: Serum AQP4\u2013IgG by cell\u2010based assay (sensitivity 75\u201390%, specificity >95%).\nStep 3: If AQP4\u2013IgG negative, test MOG-IgG (10\u201315% of seronegative NMOSD).\nStep 4: CSF analysis: mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u201350 cells/mm3), elevated protein (50\u201380\u2009mg/dL), negative OCB in 80%. CSF IL-6 levels (>7\u2009pg/mL) support NMOSD over MS.\nStep 5: Visual evoked potentials: prolonged P100 latency (>120\u2009ms) if optic pathways involved. Somatosensory EP may show central conduction delay.\nDifferential: MS (periventricular Dawson\u2019s fingers), CLIPPERS (ping-pong contrast pattern), sarcoidosis (nodular leptomeningeal enhancement).","management_principles":"First\u2010line acute therapy: IV methylprednisolone 1\u2009g/day for 5\u2009days. If incomplete response by day\u20097, add plasma exchange: 5 exchanges (1.0\u20131.5\u2009plasma volume each) every other day. Long-term immunosuppression: Rituximab 375\u2009mg/m2 weekly \u00d74 doses, then 1\u2009g every 6\u2009months; reducing annualized relapse rate by 70%. Alternative agents: Eculizumab 900\u2009mg IV weekly for 4\u2009weeks, then 1,200\u2009mg biweekly for AQP4+ NMOSD (complement C5 inhibitor; reduces relapses by 94%). Mycophenolate mofetil 1\u2009g BID and azathioprine 2\u20133\u2009mg/kg/day also used (efficacy ~60\u201370%). Monitor CBC, LFTs monthly. Vaccinate against meningococcus before Eculizumab. Manage complications: osteoporosis prophylaxis during steroids, PJP prophylaxis with TMP-SMX. In pregnancy, Azathioprine preferred; avoid Rituximab during first trimester.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinic visits every 3\u2009months in first year, then every 6\u2009months if stable. Monitor EDSS (target \u22642.0), serum CD19+ B-cell counts (target <1%), and annual brain MRI to detect subclinical lesions. Lab surveillance: CBC, LFTs, complement levels quarterly. Assess bone density at baseline and at 2\u2009years. One-year relapse\u2010free rate should exceed 80%; 5\u2010year disability\u2010free survival in treated NMOSD approaches 60%. Implement rehabilitation: occupational and speech therapy as needed. Educate on infection prophylaxis, recognition of new myelitis or optic neuritis signs, and emergency steroid protocols. Driving may resume 6\u2009months after last relapse if no severe visual or motor deficits. Provide patient with NMOSD society resources and peer-support groups.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is driven by a pathogenic autoantibody (NMO-IgG) against aquaporin-4 on astrocytes, leading to complement-mediated astrocyte injury, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, and secondary demyelination. Options A (Demyelination) and B (Axonal degeneration) describe downstream tissue damage rather than the primary immunopathology. Option C (Vascular occlusion) is not part of NMO pathobiology.","conceptual_foundation":"NMO is classified as an antibody-mediated astrocytopathy in the 2015 International Panel for NMO Diagnosis criteria. It differs from multiple sclerosis by having serum anti-AQP4 autoantibodies, a distinct lesion distribution (optic nerves and spinal cord), and frequent longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. The underlying immunology involves B cell maturation, IgG1 class switching, complement activation, and recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils to perivascular spaces.","pathophysiology":"Normal aquaporin-4 channels regulate water flux across astrocyte end-feet. In NMO, anti-AQP4 IgG1 binds these channels, activates the classical complement cascade (C1q\u2192C3b\u2192MAC), and triggers astrocyte lysis. Astrocyte loss disrupts blood\u2013brain barrier integrity, permits entry of inflammatory cells, and results in secondary demyelination and neuronal loss.","clinical_manifestation":"NMO presents with severe optic neuritis (often bilateral) and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (>3 vertebral segments). Attacks are more severe than in MS, with poorer recovery. Patients often have area postrema syndrome (intractable hiccups, vomiting) or brainstem symptoms. Relapse risk is high without immunosuppression.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: serum anti-AQP4 antibody assay by cell-based assay (sensitivity ~75%, specificity > 95%). MRI of brain and spinal cord to demonstrate LETM and optic nerve lesions. CSF may show neutrophilic pleocytosis. Second-tier: anti-MOG testing if anti-AQP4 negative and clinical features suggest MOG-IgG disease.","management_principles":"Acute attacks are treated with high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 5 days). Plasma exchange is added for steroid-refractory attacks. Long-term relapse prevention uses B-cell depleting therapies (rituximab, inebilizumab), complement inhibition (eculizumab), or IL-6 receptor blockade (satralizumab).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor B-cell counts and complement activity every 3\u20136 months.

In patients with multiple sclerosis presenting with subacute worsening of neurological function, the first step is to exclude reversible triggers of pseudo-relapse, most commonly urinary tract infection. Urinalysis has a sensitivity of approximately 85% and specificity of 90% for detecting bacteriuria in symptomatic patients (Dykstra et al., J Neurol Sci 2018). MRI with contrast (Option B) is not appropriate initially because imaging findings do not distinguish infection from true relapse, and change of disease-modifying therapy (Option C) should not be undertaken until infections are excluded. Common misconceptions include over-reliance on MRI to guide acute management and prematurely escalating DMT in the setting of infection.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis relapses are defined by new or worsening neurological symptoms lasting >24 hours in the absence of fever or infection. Pseudo-relapse refers to transient worsening of MS symptoms triggered by systemic factors like infection, heat, or metabolic disturbances. The distinction is critical because steroids are indicated only for true relapses. Urinary tract infections are the most frequent cause of pseudo-relapse, present in up to 30% of relapses (Thorpe et al., Mult Scler 2019).","pathophysiology":"UTIs lead to systemic inflammatory cytokine release (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and pyrexia, which transiently impair conduction in demyelinated axons via temperature-dependent sodium channel dysfunction. This results in reversible worsening of MS symptoms without new inflammatory demyelination.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report subacute worsening of baseline deficits, often with low-grade fever, dysuria, or urinary frequency. True relapses present with new focal deficits, often objective on examination, without systemic symptoms.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Urinalysis (leukocyte esterase, nitrite) and urine culture. Sensitivity of nitrite test ~50%, leukocyte esterase ~75%, combined sensitivity ~85%. Second-tier: Serum inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) if suspicion persists.

It requires varicella-zoster virus serology and, if negative, vaccination 4\u20136 weeks prior to initiation. However, no routine antiviral prophylaxis is recommended because infection risk (herpes zoster reactivation ~1.1% per year) is mitigated by vaccination rather than chronic antivirals (New Engl J Med 2010;362:387\u2013401). Clinically, one might consider antivirals if severe lymphopenia (<200 cells/\u03bcL) persists beyond six months, but guidelines do not mandate prophylaxis.  Option B (Alemtuzumab): Alemtuzumab is a humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody causing profound depletion of T and B lymphocytes with nadir counts at 1\u20133 months post-infusion. In pivotal CARE-MS I/II trials, viral reactivation (HSV/VZV) occurred in 8%\u201312% of patients without prophylaxis. ECTRIMS/EAN guidelines and the FDA label mandate acyclovir 200 mg twice daily or valacyclovir 500 mg daily starting on Day 1 of infusion, continuing until absolute lymphocyte count recovers >200 cells/\u03bcL or for a minimum of six months. Pathophysiologically, CD52 is expressed on mature lymphocytes and the prolonged depletion leaves patients at high risk for herpesvirus reactivation, necessitating prophylaxis. Misconceptions include confusing natalizumab\u2019s JC-virus monitoring with antiviral needs.  Option C (Natalizumab): Natalizumab blocks \u03b14-integrin, preventing leukocyte CNS entry. Major concern is PML, managed by JC-virus antibody index monitoring and extended-interval dosing, not antivirals.  Option D (Teriflunomide): As a reversible dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor, teriflunomide induces mild cytopenias and hepatotoxicity but does not require antiviral prophylaxis.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical structures in multiple sclerosis (MS) include periventricular white matter tracts, corpus callosum, optic nerves, brainstem pathways (MED\u2014middle cerebellar peduncles), and cervical spinal cord dorsal columns. Embryologically, the neural tube forms from ectoderm between weeks 3\u20134 of gestation; oligodendrocytes derive from ventral germinal zones at 12\u201314 weeks. Normal physiology relies on compact myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes, enabling saltatory conduction along axons at velocities up to 100 m/s. Myelin integrity is regulated by microglial surveillance and astrocyte-mediated homeostasis. Related demyelinating conditions include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (antibody to aquaporin-4), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (monophasic post-infectious), and leukodystrophies. Historically, Jean-Martin Charcot (1868) first described MS plaques (\u201csclerose en plaques\u201d), while the concept of immune-mediated demyelination was confirmed by pathological studies in the 20th century. Key landmarks include Dawson\u2019s fingers oriented perpendicular to ventricles and T1 hypointense \u201cblack holes\u201d denoting axonal loss. Understanding perivenular inflammatory infiltrates around small veins underpins current imaging criteria. High-yield clinical significance revolves around lesion dissemination in space and time on MRI and pathological confirmation of inflammatory demyelination with relative axonal preservation in early MS plaques.","pathophysiology":"Multiple sclerosis is characterized by an aberrant immune response against CNS myelin. At the molecular level, autoreactive CD4+ Th1 cells recognize myelin basic protein (MBP) peptides presented by HLA-DRB1*15:01 on antigen-presenting cells, leading to activation of NF-\u03baB and production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, and TNF-\u03b1. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and B cells (anti-MOG and anti-MBP antibodies) contribute to complement activation and membrane attack complex deposition. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DRB1*15:01 (OR ~3.0), IL2RA, and IL7R polymorphisms. Innate immune cells, including microglia and macrophages, secrete MMP-9 to disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier, allowing further lymphocyte infiltration. Demyelinated axons exhibit sodium channel redistribution (Nav1.2/1.6) to maintain conduction but incur increased energy demand, leading to mitochondrial damage and axonal degeneration over months to years. Compensatory remyelination by oligodendrocyte precursor cells occurs early but fails as lesions become chronic. Over time, chronic gliosis replaces active plaques, and neurodegeneration accelerates. The recurrent relapse\u2013remission pattern correlates with waves of immune reactivation, whereas progressive MS features smoldering lesions and compartmentalized inflammation within the CNS. Understanding these cascades underlies targeted therapies from interferon-\u03b2 to anti-CD20 monoclonals.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms often begin in young adults aged 20\u201340 (female:male ratio ~3:1). Subacute onset spans days to weeks; peak neurological deficit occurs by 4\u20136 weeks if untreated. Early manifestations include unilateral optic neuritis (painful vision loss in 30% of patients), internuclear ophthalmoplegia causing diplopia, and sensory disturbances (paresthesias in ~50%). Motor involvement presents as spastic weakness, hyperreflexia, and positive Babinski sign. Cerebellar involvement yields ataxia and dysarthria. Autonomic symptoms include bladder urgency (40%), sexual dysfunction, and bowel dysfunction. Phenotypes vary with age: pediatric MS may start with ADEM-like presentation; elderly onset often presents with progressive myelopathy. Relapse severity is graded by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): mild (EDSS \u22643), moderate (4\u20136), severe (\u22656.5). Systemic signs such as fatigue (80%) and depression (30%) are common. Red flags for alternative diagnoses include fever, rapid progression over days, and encephalopathy. Without treatment, average annual relapse rate is 0.8\u20131.2 and 50% progress to secondary progressive MS by 15 years. Progressive forms manifest slow accrual of disability without clear relapses over 1\u20132 years.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with clinical suspicion based on dissemination in space and time. First-line imaging is brain MRI with and without contrast, using T2-FLAIR (sensitivity ~95%) and gadolinium-enhanced T1 sequences for active lesions. Typical findings include periventricular ovoid lesions, juxtacortical U-fiber involvement, and spinal cord lesions (<3 vertebral segments). If MRI is equivocal or normal, consider a second-line MRI at three months or spinal cord imaging. CSF analysis reveals oligoclonal IgG bands in 85% of MS patients (specificity ~95%) and an elevated IgG index (>0.7). Cell count (0\u20135 WBC/mm3) and protein (15\u201345 mg/dL) are generally normal. Evoked potentials (visual, somatosensory) show delayed latencies (P100 >115 ms). Differential diagnoses include NMO (AQP4 antibody positive), MOG-IgG disease, sarcoidosis, and CNS lymphoma. NMO shows longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (>3 segments) on MRI. Sarcoidosis often has systemic granulomas; ACE levels may be elevated. In suspected primary progressive MS, spinal MRI and neurofilament light chain levels can assist. Revised 2017 McDonald criteria integrate MRI and CSF oligoclonal bands to confirm dissemination in space and time without waiting for new clinical events.","management_principles":"First-line DMTs for relapsing MS include interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b21a 30 \u03bcg IM weekly or IFN-\u03b21b 250 \u03bcg SC every other day) and glatiramer acetate (20 mg SC daily). Dimethyl fumarate is dosed at 120 mg BID for 7 days then 240 mg BID. Teriflunomide is 14 mg PO daily. Alemtuzumab, reserved for highly active disease, is given as 12 mg IV daily for five consecutive days (Course 1) and 12 mg daily for three days at month twelve (Course 2). Prophylactic acyclovir 200 mg BID starts with first infusion and continues until lymphocyte recovery (>200 cells/\u03bcL) or for six months minimum. Second-line therapies include natalizumab 300 mg IV every 28 days; screening for anti-JC virus index >0.9 guides risk mitigation. Fingolimod 0.5 mg PO daily requires ECG monitoring for first-dose bradycardia. Drug interactions: teriflunomide and warfarin (CYP interactions), natalizumab and immunosuppressants increase PML risk. Non-pharmacological: supervised exercise reduces fatigue; cognitive rehabilitation improves processing speed (Class I evidence). In refractory cases with aggressive rebound, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation shows sustained EDSS improvements in 70% at five years. Pregnancy requires cessation of teriflunomide (washout with cholestyramine) and careful planning. Hepatic/renal impairment mandates dose adjustment or avoidance of specific DMTs per FDA labeling.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits are recommended every three months during the first year of DMT and every six months thereafter if clinically stable. Clinical monitoring includes EDSS assessment, relapse history, and cognitive evaluation with Symbol Digit Modalities Test. Laboratory surveillance entails CBC, LFTs, and lymphocyte counts every three months for immunomodulators, and monthly JC virus index for natalizumab. MRI brain with gadolinium is performed at baseline, after six months, then annually to detect subclinical activity; spinal imaging if symptoms arise. Long-term complications include secondary progressive transition (incidence ~2.0% per year) and PML (risk 1:1000 for natalizumab JCV index >1.5). One-year relapse rates target <0.2, while five-year disability progression should be <15% by EDSS. Rehabilitation needs are reassessed every six months: physical therapy for spasticity management and occupational therapy for fine motor skills. Patient education covers recognition of infection signs, adherence importance, and vaccination schedules.

Imaging modalities such as conventional angiography, MRA, and intracranial Doppler lack the spatial resolution needed to detect changes in arterioles and capillaries and may be normal in up to 30\u201340% of cases. Brain biopsy sensitivity ranges from 50% to 75% when guided by areas of MRI abnormality. Option B (conventional angiography) is more sensitive for medium\u2010 to large\u2010vessel vasculitis but insufficient for small vessels. Option C (MRA) and D (intracranial Doppler) are noninvasive but have low specificity and sensitivity for small\u2010vessel disease and cannot replace tissue diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS) is an isolated inflammatory vasculitis confined to CNS vessels, classified under vasculitides in the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature and ICD\u201011. PACNS predominantly affects small leptomeningeal and parenchymal vessels, leading to multifocal ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions. Differential diagnoses include secondary CNS vasculitis (due to systemic autoimmune disease, infection, or malignancy), reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and moyamoya disease. Historically recognized since the 1950s, PACNS remains a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneous presentation and overlap with other CNS disorders. Anatomically, small\u2010vessel involvement leads to white\u2010matter and deep\u2010gray\u2010matter lesions; embryologically, these vessels derive from mesodermal angioblasts. Immune mechanisms involve activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, and, in some cases, granulomatous inflammation. Genetic predisposition is poorly defined but may involve HLA associations.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, CNS small vessels maintain blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and regulate cerebral blood flow through endothelial and perivascular support cells. In PACNS, immune dysregulation leads to antigen\u2010driven transmural inflammation. Activated CD4+ T cells and macrophages infiltrate vessel walls, releasing cytokines (e.g., IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1) and matrix metalloproteinases that disrupt the vessel basement membrane. Fibrinoid necrosis ensues, causing luminal narrowing, ischemia, and microhemorrhages. The inflammatory cascade also increases blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, resulting in vasogenic edema and radiographic contrast enhancement. Over time, chronic vascular occlusion leads to gliosis and permanent neurologic deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"PACNS typically presents in middle\u2010aged adults with a subacute to chronic course. Common symptoms include headache (60\u201370%), cognitive dysfunction or dementia (50\u201360%), focal neurologic deficits (40\u201350%), and seizures (20\u201330%). Psychiatric manifestations such as mood changes and psychosis occur in up to 15%. On MRI, multifocal T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are seen in subcortical white matter, deep gray nuclei, and leptomeninges. Contrast enhancement is patchy. CSF analysis reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis (up to 80%) and elevated protein (mean 100\u2013200 mg/dL). Natural history without treatment is progressive neurologic decline over months to years.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with MRI of the brain with contrast (sensitivity ~90%), which guides biopsy targeting. CSF examination provides supportive evidence (lymphocytic pleocytosis in 80%, elevated protein in 75%). Conventional catheter angiography detects medium\u2010 to large\u2010vessel changes (sensitivity 30\u201350%) but often misses small\u2010vessel lesions. A negative angiogram does not exclude PACNS. Brain biopsy remains the definitive diagnostic test; optimal yield requires at least two biopsy specimens including leptomeninges and cortex from radiographically abnormal regions. Biopsy specificity approaches 100%, and sensitivity increases when multiple sites are sampled.","management_principles":"First\u2010line induction therapy consists of high\u2010dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3\u20135 days followed by oral prednisone taper over 6\u201312 months) combined with cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2 IV monthly for 6 months). Adjunctive PJP prophylaxis (e.g., trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole) and bone\u2010loss prevention (calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates) are recommended. Maintenance immunosuppression (azathioprine or methotrexate) follows induction for 12\u201318 months total therapy. Recent AAN guidelines (2011) classify this regimen as Level B evidence.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should undergo clinical and MRI evaluations at 3, 6, and 12 months post\u2010treatment initiation. Laboratory monitoring includes CBC, CMP, ESR/CRP monthly during induction and every 3 months during maintenance. Relapse occurs in ~25% within 5 years; persistent or new MRI lesions warrant repeat CSF analysis and possible rebiopsy. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up extends for at least 2 years after therapy completion due to relapse risk.","clinical_pearls":"1. Brain biopsy is required to confirm small\u2010vessel CNS vasculitis; imaging alone is insufficient. 2. MRI often shows multifocal white\u2010matter lesions with variable enhancement. 3. CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein support but do not confirm diagnosis. 4. Conventional angiography may be normal in up to 40% of PACNS cases. 5. Combined high\u2010dose steroids and cyclophosphamide induction yields the best outcomes.","references":"1.
