Flu\u2010like symptoms (minor illness) occur in about 4\u20138%, aseptic meningitis in 1\u20132%, and paralytic poliomyelitis in less than 1%. Option A is correct based on epidemiological studies and WHO data. Option B (meningitis) is seen in \u223c1\u20132% and thus far less common. Option C (flu\u2010like symptoms) occurs in fewer cases than asymptomatic infection. Option D (flaccid weakness) reflects paralytic disease, the rarest manifestation (<1%).","conceptual_foundation":"Poliovirus, an enterovirus in the Picornaviridae family, is transmitted via the fecal\u2013oral route. After ingestion, it replicates in the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract, then disseminates via lymphatics and bloodstream. Most infections never reach the central nervous system due to host immune responses. CNS invasion occurs in a small minority of cases, leading to aseptic meningitis or anterior horn cell destruction and flaccid paralysis.","pathophysiology":"Following mucosal replication, poliovirus enters the bloodstream (primary viremia) and may seed the central nervous system (secondary viremia). Neuroinvasion involves retrograde axonal transport and infection of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. The majority of infections neutralize peripherally without CNS involvement, hence the high rate of asymptomatic cases.","clinical_manifestation":"Asymptomatic infection predominates. Minor illness presents as nonspecific flu\u2010like symptoms (fever, malaise, sore throat) in \u223c4\u20138%. Aseptic meningitis presents with fever, headache, and neck stiffness in \u223c1\u20132%. Paralytic poliomyelitis presents with acute onset flaccid paralysis, areflexia, and muscle pain in <1%.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis in asymptomatic contacts relies on virus isolation from stool and throat specimens or PCR. In CNS disease, CSF may show lymphocytic pleocytosis and normal glucose; PCR or viral culture confirms poliovirus. Serology (neutralizing antibodies) can support retrospective diagnosis.","management_principles":"No specific antiviral exists; management is supportive. Acute paralytic cases require respiratory support (ventilation), analgesics, and intensive physiotherapy. Early mobilization and muscle strengthening reduce long\u2010term disability.","follow_up_guidelines":"Long\u2010term follow\u2010up focuses on rehabilitation and monitoring for post\u2010polio syndrome (fatigue, new muscle weakness 15\u201340 years post\u2010infection). Multidisciplinary care addresses orthopedic complications and quality of life.","clinical_pearls":"1. >90% of poliovirus infections are asymptomatic. 2. Paralytic disease occurs in <1%. 3.

In a 64-year-old patient with suspected bacterial meningitis presenting with fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status, empiric coverage must include Listeria monocytogenes (ampicillin), gram-negative rods including Pseudomonas (ceftazidime), and synergistic aminoglycoside coverage (gentamicin) when renal function allows. Option A (penicillin G alone) is insufficient for gram-negative coverage. Option C (acyclovir) addresses viral encephalitis but not bacterial meningitis. Option D (ceftazidime and metronidazole) lacks Listeria coverage and is appropriate for brain abscess, not meningitis. Although current IDSA guidelines recommend vancomycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) plus ampicillin, ceftazidime plus gentamicin is an acceptable alternative where ceftriaxone is unavailable or the patient is at risk for Pseudomonas (Clin Infect Dis. 2004;39:1267\u20131284).","conceptual_foundation":"Acute bacterial meningitis in adults over 50 is most commonly due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. ICD-11 classifies meningitis under \u2018Infective diseases of the central nervous system.\u2019 Differential includes viral meningitis, fungal meningitis (e.g., Cryptococcus), subarachnoid hemorrhage, and drug-induced aseptic meningitis. The blood\u2013brain barrier and meningeal inflammation are key to pathogenesis and guide antimicrobial penetration. Age-related immunosenescence and comorbidities increase risk for Listeria and gram-negative organisms.","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF is produced at 0.3 mL/min by the choroid plexus, circulates through ventricles and subarachnoid space, then is reabsorbed by arachnoid granulations. In bacterial meningitis, pathogens enter via bloodstream, nasopharyngeal invasion, or direct extension. They adhere to meningeal endothelium, cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, and proliferate in the subarachnoid space. Bacterial cell wall components activate toll-like receptors on resident macrophages and microglia, releasing cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), causing vasodilation, increased permeability, and neutrophil infiltration. Elevated intracranial pressure and cerebral edema result from blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Listeria\u2019s intracellular lifecycle permits evasion of humoral immunity, requiring ampicillin\u2019s cell-penetrating action and gentamicin synergy to eradicate.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status occurs in ~50\u201370% of cases. Headache is present in up to 90%. Nausea, photophobia, and seizures occur in 20\u201330%. Cranial nerve palsies (esp. VI) may be seen. In older adults, presentation can be subtle with only fever and confusion. CSF typically shows neutrophilic pleocytosis (>1000 cells/mm\u00b3), low glucose (<40 mg/dL), and high protein (>200 mg/dL). Blood cultures are positive in 50\u201360%.","diagnostic_approach":"Immediate blood cultures followed by lumbar puncture unless contraindicated by raised ICP signs. CT scan prior to LP if focal deficits or papilledema. CSF analysis sensitivity/specificity: Gram stain (positive in 60\u201390%), culture (70\u201385%). PCR for Listeria and other pathogens in CSF is adjunctive. Empiric antibiotics should be administered within 30 minutes of presentation. Pre-test probability is high with classic presentation and CSF findings.","management_principles":"IDSA guidelines (Clin Infect Dis. 2004;39:1267\u20131284) recommend empiric vancomycin plus ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime) plus ampicillin for adults >50 years. In penicillin-allergic patients, moxifloxacin plus vancomycin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used. Gentamicin is added for synergy against Listeria when bacteremia is present. Adjunctive dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg IV q6h for four days) reduces hearing loss and neurological sequelae in pneumococcal meningitis (Level A).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status and hearing. Repeat LP only if clinical deterioration or lack of improvement after 48 hours. Audiometry at discharge. Duration of therapy: 10\u201314 days for N. meningitidis and H. influenzae; 14\u201321 days for S. pneumoniae; \u226521 days for Listeria. Rehabilitation for cognitive and motor deficits as needed.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always cover Listeria in >50 years with ampicillin \u2013 it is not covered by cephalosporins. 2. Dexamethasone before or with first antibiotic dose reduces pneumococcal meningitis morbidity. 3. Gram stain of CSF yields rapid preliminary diagnosis \u2013 sensitivity varies by organism load. 4.

In patients with advanced HIV (CD4 count <100 cells/\u00b5L), cerebral toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of ring-enhancing lesions and brain abscesses. Meta-analyses (Antinori et al., 2010) report toxoplasma as the etiology in ~60\u201370% of such cases. Option A (TB) is less frequent for focal abscess formation in HIV, more often causing meningitis. Option C (CMV) does not typically form abscesses but rather encephalitis or ventriculoencephalitis.","conceptual_foundation":"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan. In immunocompetent hosts, infection is often latent; in immunosuppressed patients (especially HIV-infected with CD4 <100), reactivation in the brain leads to multiple abscesses. HIV-associated brain abscesses differential includes Toxoplasma, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and less commonly fungal pathogens.","pathophysiology":"Reactivation of encysted bradyzoites in the CNS leads to parasite replication, local necrosis, and abscess formation with ring-enhancing lesions. An inflammatory response forms a perivascular cuff and central necrosis. In HIV, loss of CD4+ T-cell\u2013mediated immunity allows unchecked tachyzoite proliferation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with headache, fever, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and altered mental status. Multiple lesions in basal ganglia or corticomedullary junction are typical. Symptoms evolve over days to weeks.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes contrast-enhanced MRI or CT demonstrating multiple ring-enhancing lesions. Serum Toxoplasma IgG positivity has high negative predictive value; PCR of CSF is less sensitive. Empiric anti-toxoplasma therapy with pyrimethamine\u2013sulfadiazine is diagnostic and therapeutic, with clinical and radiographic improvement by 2 weeks confirming diagnosis.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["HSV encephalitis","Cerebral toxoplasmosis","Temporal lobe epilepsy","None of the above"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"HSV encephalitis","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: HSV encephalitis is the definitive diagnosis in this 19-year-old with acute onset visual and auditory hallucinations, fever (38.9\u00b0C), meningeal signs, and generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure within 48 hours of admission. Over 90% of HSV encephalitis cases involve the temporal lobes, explaining the psychiatric prodrome (hallucinations occur in 60% of patients) and focal neurological signs. PCR of CSF for HSV DNA has a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 99%. Early treatment with IV acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours) reduces mortality from 70% to below 20%. Common misconceptions include misattributing seizures to primary psychiatric illness or temporal lobe epilepsy without fever. Option B: Cerebral toxoplasmosis typically occurs in immunocompromised patients (75% of HIV+ cases), presents subacutely with focal deficits, headaches, and ring-enhancing lesions on MRI rather than rapid meningoencephalitis. CSF PCR for Toxoplasma gondii is <60% sensitive. Option C: Temporal lobe epilepsy can present with auditory or visual aura but rarely causes fever or meningeal signs. Interictal EEG shows focal sharp waves in 80% of cases; our patient was postictal with fever and meningismus. Option D: \u201cNone of the above\u201d is incorrect because the clear clinical syndrome and diagnostic yield for HSV encephalitis meet criteria. According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines (2013), acute febrile encephalopathy with temporal lobe involvement mandates empiric acyclovir pending CSF PCR results, reaffirming option A as correct.","conceptual_foundation":"HSV encephalitis primarily affects the limbic system, especially the medial temporal lobes (hippocampus, amygdala) and inferior frontal cortex. These regions are richly innervated by the trigeminal nerve, the presumptive route for viral entry via retrograde axonal transport. Embryologically, the telencephalon develops into the cerebral hemispheres, including temporal lobes, by week 8; disruption of neuronal migration pathways predisposes to focal viral tropism. Under normal conditions, the temporal lobe processes auditory and visual memories via the perforant pathway and connects to the hypothalamus through the fornix. In HSV encephalitis, inflammation in the limbic cortex leads to psychiatric symptoms, disorientation, and seizures. Historically, first descriptions date to the 1850s by Rudolf Virchow, with viral etiology proposed by Crile in 1919 and confirmed by viral isolation in the 1930s. Key anatomical landmarks on MRI include hyperintense T2/FLAIR signal in the medial temporal lobes, insular cortex, and cingulate gyrus. Clinically significant landmarks on CT may be obscured, making MRI the gold standard. Differential involvement of the Sylvian fissure and involvement of adjacent insular cortex can mimic stroke but temporal lobe predilection directs towards HSV infection.","pathophysiology":"HSV-1 gains entry into neurons by binding glycoproteins gB and gD to host cell receptors, such as Nectin-1 and herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM). Fusion of viral envelope via gH/gL complex allows capsid transport along microtubules using dynein motors to the nucleus, initiating lytic replication. Viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates acyclovir, allowing chain termination. Innate immune sensing via Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in neurons and glial cells triggers type I interferon release (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), but HSV-1 encodes ICP47 to inhibit antigen presentation via TAP complex, delaying adaptive immunity. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells release perforin and granzyme B, limiting spread but also causing collateral neuronal damage. Elevated IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in CSF correlate with severity. Genetic TLR3 pathway defects account for about 4% of sporadic HSV encephalitis in children. Mitochondrial energy failure due to cytochrome c release and oxidative stress contributes to necrosis in 24\u201372 hours. Microglial activation and astrocyte proliferation (gliosis) develop over days leading to increased intracranial pressure. Limited neurogenesis in affected hippocampal regions impairs recovery. Compensatory hyperplasia of contralateral temporal hippocampal fibers may occur but does not fully restore memory function.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset typically begins with prodromal headache, fever, and malaise 1\u20133 days before focal symptoms. Days 0\u20132: psychiatric changes including hallucinations (visual in 40%, auditory in 35%), confusion, and irritability. Days 2\u20134: seizures occur in 50\u201360% of adults, commonly focal evolving to bilateral tonic\u2013clonic within 24 hours. Meningeal signs (neck stiffness, photophobia) are present in approximately 75% of cases. Neurological examination can reveal focal temporal lobe findings: aphasia in 45%, dysphasia, memory impairment on verbal recall tests (<5/10 items), and olfactory hallucinations. Pediatric patients often present with more seizures (80%) but less prominent hallucinations. Elderly may have lower fever response (<38\u00b0C in 30%) and present with delirium rather than frank psychosis. Gender differences are minimal, though males have a slightly higher incidence (1.3:1). Associated systemic manifestations include autonomic dysfunction (hypertension, tachycardia) in 25%. Severity grading by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) correlates with outcome: GCS <8 predicts 60% mortality. Without treatment, mortality at 30 days approaches 70%, and survivors face severe cognitive deficits in 80%. Red flags: rapid progression (<72 hours), refractory seizures, and declining consciousness warrant urgent CSF evaluation.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Stabilize airway, breathing, circulation, and perform urgent noncontrast head CT to exclude mass lesions (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%). Step 2: If no contraindications, perform lumbar puncture within 30 minutes in the ED. CSF typically shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013500 cells/mm3, 80% lymphocytes), elevated protein (100\u2013500 mg/dL), and normal to low glucose (40\u201360 mg/dL). PCR for HSV-1 DNA in CSF is first-line with sensitivity 96% and specificity 99%. Step 3: Brain MRI with FLAIR and diffusion-weighted imaging reveals hyperintense lesions in temporal lobes and insula in 95% of cases; gadolinium enhancement in 80%. Step 4: EEG may show periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in temporal regions in 50\u201360%. Step 5: Exclude differential diagnoses: CSF bacterial culture (negative), cryptococcal antigen (<1:2), acid-fast bacilli smear for TB (sensitivity 50%). CT chest/abdomen if metastatic or paraneoplastic encephalitis suspected. Consider autoimmune panel (anti-NMDA receptor) if HSV PCR negative after 72 hours. Advanced tests: brain biopsy only if all other tests inconclusive (yield ~70%). Decision point: start empiric acyclovir immediately when HSV encephalitis suspected, never delay for imaging beyond CT.","management_principles":"First-line therapy: IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14\u201321 days (adjust to creatinine clearance: e.g., 10 mg/kg q12h if CrCl <50 mL/min). Loading dose not required. Maintenance dosing follows same regimen without taper. Monitor renal function daily; ensure hydration to prevent crystalline nephropathy. Second-line: if acyclovir resistance (mutations in UL23 thymidine kinase gene in \u22641% cases), use IV foscarnet 60 mg/kg q8h or 90 mg/kg q12h for 14\u201321 days. Third-line: cidofovir 5 mg/kg weekly for 2 weeks if foscarnet fails. Concomitant seizure management: IV levetiracetam loading 20 mg/kg then 500 mg BID, or fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg. Avoid phenytoin in hepatic impairment. Nonpharmacological: intracranial pressure control with head elevation, hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV bolus) for refractory intracranial hypertension. Surgical decompression (external ventricular drain) indicated for herniation signs; success rate ~65%. In pregnancy, acyclovir is category B and considered safe; dose adjust for renal impairment. Prophylactic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin recommended to reduce venous thromboembolism risk by 50%. Regular monitoring of CBC, renal, and liver panels is mandatory every 48 hours.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurology follow-up at 2 weeks postdischarge, then monthly for 3 months, then quarterly up to 1 year. Monitor cognitive recovery using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) targeting a score >26 by 6 months. Repeat brain MRI at 4\u20136 weeks to confirm resolution of temporal lobe hyperintensities and monitor for sequelae (gliosis, encephalomalacia). CSF analysis can be repeated only if new neurological decline occurs; HSV PCR positive conversion after treatment is rare (<2%). Monitor for long-term complications: epilepsy develops in 30\u201350% at 1 year; start prophylactic antiepileptics if unprovoked seizures recur. Cognitive rehabilitation should begin within 1 month; incidence of persistent memory deficits at 1 year is 40%. Prognosis: 1-year survival 75\u201380%, 5-year 70%, with moderate-to-severe disability in 50%. Provide patient education on medication adherence, seizure precautions (no driving for at least 6 months after last seizure), and neuropsychiatric support (support groups such as Encephalitis Society). Occupational therapy evaluation within 4 weeks to address daily living skills and return-to-work planning.","clinical_pearls":"1.
