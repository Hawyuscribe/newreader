Options A (SCA3), B (ataxia with ocular apraxia), and C (Leber hereditary optic neuropathy) are hereditary disorders with chronic progressive courses and do not present acutely with this classic triad. Therefore, none of the listed options is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute neurologic emergency resulting from deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1), a cofactor for key enzymes in cerebral energy metabolism. It is not classified under spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA3) or autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias with ocular apraxia; nor does it fit mitochondrial Leber optic neuropathy. In ICD-11 it is coded as 8A60.0 (nutritional and metabolic encephalopathies), and historically was first described by Carl Wernicke in 1881. Differential diagnoses include alcohol-related cerebellar degeneration, paraneoplastic cerebellar syndromes, and demyelinating disorders.","pathophysiology":"Thiamine is required for pyruvate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase. Deficiency impairs ATP production and increases oxidative stress, leading to neuronal death and petechial hemorrhages in vulnerable regions such as the mammillary bodies, medial thalami, periaqueductal gray, and cranial nerve nuclei. Early cellular changes include endothelial dysfunction, blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown, astrocyte swelling, and microhemorrhages.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely, often in the setting of alcoholism, malnutrition, or malabsorption, with confusion (65\u201385%), gait ataxia (up to 80%), and ocular abnormalities including nystagmus, conjugate gaze palsies, and blurred vision. Only 10\u201316% exhibit the full triad. Without treatment, up to 20% die, and survivors may develop Korsakoff syndrome with irreversible memory impairment.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical; do not wait for laboratory confirmation. MRI has a sensitivity of ~50% and specificity of ~93% for typical lesions (T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in medial thalami, mammillary bodies, periaqueductal region).

Huntington disease. Bilateral caudate atrophy on axial brain CT or MRI is a classic imaging marker of Huntington disease (HD). In HD, neuronal loss and gliosis predominantly affect the medium spiny neurons of the striatum (caudate and putamen), producing enlargement of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles and characteristic \"boxcar\" ventriculomegaly. Option B (Chorea-acanthocytosis) can show striatal atrophy but typically presents with peripheral acanthocytes, orofacial dyskinesias, and elevated CK\u2014features not specified here. Option C (Huntington disease\u2013like 2) is a rare, HD phenocopy seen primarily in individuals of African descent and associated with a different gene (JPH3); it is clinically indistinguishable from HD but far less common. Option D (FTLD-FUS) is a frontotemporal lobar degeneration subtype marked by behavioral and language changes, not prominent chorea or caudate atrophy on imaging. The pattern of imaging and typical epidemiology most strongly support classic HD.","conceptual_foundation":"Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene on chromosome 4p16.3. According to ICD-11, it falls under 8A60.0 (Huntington disease). Pathologically, HD is characterized by selective vulnerability of striatal medium spiny neurons projecting to the external globus pallidus. The caudate atrophy evolves over decades and correlates with clinical onset and progression. Differential diagnoses for bilateral caudate atrophy include other hereditary choreas (HD-like syndromes), Wilson disease, neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, pantothenate kinase\u2013associated neurodegeneration, and HIV-associated dementia, among others. Historically described by George Huntington in 1872, the genetic basis was elucidated in 1993 with identification of the CAG repeat expansion. Embryologically, the striatum arises from the telencephalic portion of the basal ganglia; medium spiny neurons depend on DARPP-32 and require BDNF trophic support from cortical afferents. Neurotransmitter systems most affected include GABAergic and enkephalinergic pathways, with secondary dopaminergic dysfunction.","pathophysiology":"Normal striatal medium spiny neurons integrate cortical glutamatergic input and nigrostriatal dopaminergic modulation to regulate motor control. In HD, mutant huntingtin protein with expanded polyglutamine tract undergoes aberrant cleavage, translocates to the nucleus, and disrupts transcriptional regulation (e.g., downregulation of BDNF), mitochondrial function, and axonal transport. This leads to excitotoxicity, increased intracellular calcium, activation of caspases, and neuronal apoptosis primarily in the indirect pathway (D2-receptor expressing neurons) of the basal ganglia circuitry. Loss of indirect pathway inhibition results in chorea. Progression involves eventual involvement of the direct pathway and cortical atrophy, producing bradykinesia and rigidity in later stages. Inflammatory microglial activation and astrocytosis exacerbate neuronal loss. Genetic anticipation (earlier onset in successive generations) correlates with CAG repeat length. Unlike HD, HD-like 2 arises from JPH3 repeat expansions and displays overlap in pathophysiology but is epidemiologically distinct, while chorea-acanthocytosis involves VPS13A gene mutations affecting chorein and red cell morphology.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic HD presents in mid-adulthood (average onset 35\u201345 years) with chorea, impaired voluntary movements, and psychiatric symptoms. Early hyperkinetic movements include facial tics, finger tapping irregularities, and trunk movements. Behavioral changes such as irritability, depression, apathy, and executive dysfunction often precede motor signs by years. Cognitive decline leads to subcortical dementia. Juvenile HD (<20 years) shows rigidity, bradykinesia, seizures, and rapid progression. Natural history without treatment spans ~15\u201320 years from onset to death, often due to pneumonia or heart disease. Diagnostic criteria rely on unequivocal motor signs in a person at risk with genetic confirmation (\u226536 CAG repeats). Penetrance is nearly complete by 65 years when repeat length \u226540.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes thorough family history, clinical exam for chorea, and baseline neuroimaging. MRI reveals caudate and putaminal atrophy with ventricular enlargement; CT can show similar findings. Genetic testing for HTT CAG repeat expansion is confirmatory; a repeat length \u226540 repeats establishes diagnosis with complete penetrance. Repeats of 36\u201339 show reduced penetrance. Sensitivity and specificity of genetic testing approach 99%. Second-tier tests exclude mimics: serum ceruloplasmin and copper studies for Wilson disease, peripheral smear for acanthocytes in neuroacanthocytosis, neuropsychological assessment for frontotemporal dementia. Third-tier specialized tests include JPH3 gene testing for HD-like 2 in appropriate ethnic groups.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy. Symptomatic management includes tetrabenazine (FDA-approved; depletes presynaptic dopamine; Class I evidence showing ~40% reduction in chorea scores) or deutetrabenazine. Antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone, haloperidol) can reduce chorea and manage behavioral symptoms. SSRIs treat depression and obsessive-compulsive features. Supportive therapies include physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Emerging gene-silencing therapies (antisense oligonucleotides targeting HTT mRNA) have shown promising reductions in mutant huntingtin in early-phase trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require multidisciplinary care. Neurology follow-up every 6\u201312 months to monitor motor progression and medication side effects. Psychiatric evaluation as needed.

PKD is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance; PRRT2 gene mutations are identified in ~60% of familial cases. Embryologically, basal ganglia development from lateral ganglionic eminence underlies movement regulation circuits. Neuroanatomically, PKD implicates dysfunctional thalamocortical\u2013striatal\u2013pallidal circuits, particularly the indirect pathway. Neurotransmitters: GABAergic pallidal outputs, glutamatergic cortico-striatal inputs; PRRT2 protein interacts with synaptic vesicle release machinery.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: balanced basal ganglia direct and indirect pathways modulate movement initiation. In PKD, PRRT2 mutations or unknown sporadic mechanisms cause increased striatal excitability upon sudden movement triggers.
