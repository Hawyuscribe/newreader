[{"question_number":"1","question":"An elderly patient came with low-grade fever, meningism, encephalopathy, and acute flaccid paralysis. What is your diagnosis?","options":["WNV","Polio","HIV"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"WNV","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. West Nile Virus (WNV) infection. Elderly patients with low-grade fever, meningism, encephalopathy, and acute flaccid paralysis classically point to WNV neuroinvasive disease. WNV can cause meningoencephalitis and a poliomyelitis-like syndrome with anterior horn cell involvement leading to acute flaccid paralysis (Sejvar JJ. Lancet Infect Dis. 2014). Polio (option B) is eradicated in most regions and rarely seen in the elderly; it presents without meningism and encephalopathy. HIV (option C) does not typically cause acute flaccid paralysis with meningism in this pattern nor present with an acute febrile meningoencephalitis picture.","conceptual_foundation":"WNV is a Flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes. Neuroinvasive disease occurs in <1% of infected individuals, more commonly in the elderly or immunocompromised. Clinical syndromes include meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. The poliomyelitis-like syndrome results from viral invasion of anterior horn cells similar to poliovirus.","pathophysiology":"After mosquito bite, WNV replicates in dendritic cells, travels to lymph nodes, and enters systemic circulation. In some, it crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier, infecting neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, brainstem, and spinal anterior horn cells. The resulting neuronal injury and inflammation cause encephalopathy, meningism, and flaccid paralysis.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms of WNV neuroinvasive disease include fever (100%), headache (90%), neck stiffness (60%), altered mental status (50%), and acute asymmetric flaccid limb weakness (20\u201350%). The time course is days to weeks after infection. MRI may show T2 hyperintensities in spinal cord anterior horns.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Serum and CSF WNV IgM antibody (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~99%). MRI spine with contrast if acute flaccid paralysis. EMG/nerve conduction studies demonstrate denervation. Exclude other viral etiologies and GBS.","management_principles":"No specific antiviral therapy exists. Supportive care includes hospitalization, IV fluids, respiratory support if needed, and physical rehabilitation. Immunoglobulin therapy remains investigational.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes serial neurologic exams, repeat neuroimaging if clinical deterioration, and long-term rehabilitation for residual weakness. Prognosis: around 50% of those with flaccid paralysis have persistent deficits after 1 year.","clinical_pearls":"1. WNV can mimic poliomyelitis with asymmetric flaccid paralysis. 2. CSF IgM remains positive for months\u2014useful diagnostic marker. 3. Elderly are at highest risk for neuroinvasive disease. 4. MRI anterior horn cell T2 hyperintensity is characteristic. 5. No approved antiviral\u2014supportive care only.","references":"1. Sejvar JJ. Lancet Infect Dis. 2014;14(5):491-499. doi:10.1016/S1473-3099(14)70736-5 2. Petersen LR, et al.

The most common etiology for spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is hematogenous seeding, accounting for 50\u201360% of cases (Darouiche, 2006). Option A (Osteomyelitis) and B (Penetrating trauma) are less frequent. Option C (Lumbar puncture) is a rare iatrogenic cause.","conceptual_foundation":"SEA is an accumulation of purulent material in the epidural space. Sources include hematogenous spread from skin infections, endocarditis, urinary tract infections, and intravenous drug use. Direct extension from vertebral osteomyelitis is also seen but secondary to bacteremia.","pathophysiology":"Bacteria enter the epidural space via the valveless Batson plexus or arterial circulation. An inflammatory response leads to abscess formation, compression of spinal cord/cauda equina, resulting in ischemia and neurological deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic presentation: back pain (90%), fever (50%), and neurologic deficits (33\u201350%). Progression through stages: localized pain, radicular pain, motor weakness, sensory deficits, and paralysis.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with gadolinium is gold standard (sensitivity >95%, specificity >90%). Blood cultures positive in ~60% of cases. CT myelography if MRI contraindicated.","management_principles":"Empiric broad\u2010spectrum IV antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin plus third\u2010generation cephalosporin) followed by culture\u2010directed therapy for 6 weeks. Urgent neurosurgical decompression indicated for neurologic deficits or spinal instability.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat MRI at 4\u20136 weeks to confirm resolution. Monitor inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) weekly until normalization.","clinical_pearls":"1. Back pain out of proportion to exam is an early SEA sign. 2. Elevated CRP (>10 mg/L) is sensitive (90%) for SEA. 3. MRI is diagnostic modality of choice. 4. Neurologic deficits require surgical decompression within 24 h. 5. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen.","references":"1. Darouiche RO. Spinal epidural abscess. N Engl J Med. 2006;355(19):2012\u20132020. DOI:10.1056/NEJMra055111. 2. Sendi P et al.

Option A (7 days) is too short and has been associated with higher relapse rates. Option C (21 days) reflects the maximal duration in refractory cases but is not the standard initial course. Option D (72 hours) refers to prophylactic regimens, not treatment.","conceptual_foundation":"HSV encephalitis is most often caused by HSV-1 reactivation in the central nervous system, leading to necrotizing hemorrhagic inflammation predominantly of the temporal lobes. It is classified as viral encephalitis (ICD-11: 1D80.0) and must be distinguished from autoimmune and other infectious encephalitides. The virus resides latent in trigeminal ganglia and invades the brain via olfactory or trigeminal pathways.","pathophysiology":"HSV-1 invades neurons and glia, triggering a cascade of viral replication, cell lysis, and inflammation. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and microglial activation contribute to necrosis and hemorrhage. The blood\u2013brain barrier disruption allows influx of inflammatory cells, leading to characteristic CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely with fever, headache, altered mental status, focal seizures, and sometimes hemiparesis or aphasia. CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013500 cells/mm3), elevated protein (100\u2013500 mg/dL), and normal to low glucose. MRI typically demonstrates bilateral temporal lobe hyperintensities on T2/FLAIR.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010line tests include CSF PCR for HSV DNA (sensitivity ~96%, specificity ~99%) and MRI brain. EEG may show periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges. A negative PCR early in the disease warrants repeat testing if suspicion remains high.","management_principles":"Administer IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (adjusted for renal function) for 14 days. Ensure adequate hydration and monitor renal function to prevent crystal nephropathy. Empiric therapy should be initiated upon suspicion, before confirmatory tests return.","follow_up_guidelines":"Perform clinical re-evaluation and consider repeat MRI if no improvement by day 7\u201310. Neurocognitive testing is recommended post-treatment. Outpatient follow-up should include renal monitoring and assessment for residual deficits.","clinical_pearls":"\u2022 Always start acyclovir empirically in suspected viral encephalitis. \u2022 CSF red blood cells may be elevated in HSV encephalitis. \u2022 Temporal lobe MRI findings are highly suggestive. \u2022 Early treatment reduces mortality from ~70% to ~20%. \u2022 Consider repeat PCR if initial test is negative and clinical suspicion persists.","references":"Whitley RJ et al.

Amoxicillin alone (option A) is insufficient. Vancomycin (option B) has no activity against Brucella. Rifampin (option D) is used in combination regimens but not as monotherapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Brucella species are facultative intracellular Gram-negative coccobacilli causing systemic brucellosis; neurobrucellosis is a rare but serious complication involving the meninges or CNS parenchyma (ICD-11: 1F6P). Differential includes tuberculous meningitis and Lyme neuroborreliosis.","pathophysiology":"Brucella invades and survives within macrophages, disseminating hematogenously and causing granulomatous inflammation in the meninges and parenchyma.
