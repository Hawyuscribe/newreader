[{"question_number":"3","question":"A patient presented with fever and confusion, was anemic, and had hypoglycemia, which was treated. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was normal along with labs. What medication should be used to treat this patient?","options":["Acyclovir","Artemisinin","Vancomycin","Ceftriaxone"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Artemisinin","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: B. Artemisinin derivatives (e.g., intravenous artesunate) are the treatment of choice for severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria presenting with cerebral involvement, hypoglycemia, anemia, and confusion. The World Health Organization\u2019s 2015 guidelines (Level A evidence) recommend IV artesunate over quinine based on reduced mortality (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52\u20130.72, SEAQUAMAT trial, 2010). The rapid parasiticidal action of artemisinins clears high parasite loads within 48 hours, corrects hypoglycemia by reducing parasite\u2010induced metabolic derangements, and improves consciousness. \n\nOption A (Acyclovir) is indicated for herpes simplex encephalitis, which presents with CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and MRI temporal lobe lesions. Sensitivity of HSV PCR in CSF is >95% (NEJM, 2004), which was not the case here. Option C (Vancomycin) and D (Ceftriaxone) are first-line for bacterial meningitis; they would be indicated if CSF demonstrated neutrophilic pleocytosis, low glucose, or high protein (AHA/IDSA 2016 guidelines). Normal CSF and labs rule out bacterial or viral encephalitis, pointing instead toward cerebral malaria. Thus, artemisinin is the only option matching the presentation.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral malaria is a severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection characterized by impaired consciousness and neurological signs. In the ICD-11, it is coded under 1D70.0 (falciparum malaria) with CNS involvement. Historically, first-line antimalarials evolved from quinine to chloroquine to artemisinin derivatives following resistance patterns. The parasite life cycle begins with sporozoites inoculation by Anopheles mosquitoes, invasion of hepatocytes, release of merozoites, and erythrocyte infection. Sequestration of parasitized red cells in cerebral microvasculature leads to microvascular obstruction and inflammation. Differential diagnoses include viral encephalitis (HSV, West Nile), bacterial meningitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis, and metabolic encephalopathies. The host\u2019s immune response, including TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 release, exacerbates endothelial activation and blood\u2013brain barrier dysfunction. Understanding this path from basic parasitology and immunology to clinical neurology is central to recognizing cerebral malaria.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, cerebral perfusion and glucose delivery maintain neuronal function. In falciparum malaria, parasites induce cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes to cerebral endothelium via PfEMP1 binding to ICAM-1 and CD36, causing microvascular congestion. This leads to local hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2). Hypoglycemia arises from high parasite glucose consumption and quinine\u2010induced insulin secretion. Anemia results from hemolysis and splenic clearance of uninfected erythrocytes, reducing oxygen-carrying capacity. The ensuing ischemia and edema underlie confusion and seizures. Artemisinins act by generating reactive oxygen species via endoperoxide bridges, damaging parasite proteins and membranes, rapidly reducing parasite biomass and reversing metabolic derangements. This targeted action distinguishes them from broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics or antivirals.","clinical_manifestation":"Cerebral malaria presents with fever, headache, confusion, altered consciousness, seizures (30\u201350% of adults, up to 80% in children), and anemia (hemoglobin <8 g/dL in 40%\u201360%). Hypoglycemia (<2.2 mmol/L) occurs in up to 10% of severe cases and predicts poor outcome. Physical exam may reveal hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and retinopathy (retinal whitening, vessel changes). Onset is typically 5\u201314 days post\u2010infection. Prodromal symptoms include fever spikes every 48\u201372 hours. Untreated, mortality reaches 15%\u201320% in adults. WHO diagnostic criteria require P. falciparum parasitemia plus unarousable coma not attributable to other causes. Special populations: children may present with rapid progression to seizures; pregnant women exhibit higher parasite densities and risk of fetal loss.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Peripheral thick and thin blood smears (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%) remain gold standard; quantification of parasite density guides severity. Rapid diagnostic tests detecting HRP2 antigen (sensitivity 94%, specificity 93%) provide point-of-care results. Pre-test probability is high in endemic settings with fever and neurological signs. Second-tier: PCR assays have highest sensitivity (99%) but limited availability. Third-tier: Fundoscopy for malarial retinopathy shows high specificity (90%) for cerebral involvement. Key pitfalls: low-level parasitemia in partially treated cases; repeated smears every 12\u201324 hours if initial negative. CSF analysis is normal, distinguishing from encephalitis. MRI may show diffuse cerebral edema but is not required.","management_principles":"WHO recommends IV artesunate 2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12, and 24 hours, then daily until oral therapy feasible (Grade A). Artesunate reduces mortality by 35% compared to quinine (SEAQUAMAT trial). Monitor for post-artesunate delayed hemolysis at day 14. Supportive care includes correction of hypoglycemia with dextrose infusions, management of seizures with IV diazepam or parenteral phenobarbital, and transfusion for hemoglobin <5 g/dL. Avoid quinine in hypoglycemia due to insulin release. Treat anemia and maintain euvolemia. Adjunctive corticosteroids and exchange transfusion are not recommended. After stabilization, switch to a full 3-day course of artemisinin-based combination therapy (e.g., artemether\u2013lumefantrine).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor parasitemia daily until negative. Check hemoglobin, glucose, renal and liver function every 12\u201324 hours during acute phase. Follow-up for post-treatment hemolysis includes LDH and haptoglobin at days 7 and 14. Neurological assessment daily until full recovery; inspect for residual cognitive or motor deficits. Screen for malarial retinopathy resolution if initially present. Educate patients on prevention: bed nets, prophylaxis for travelers. Ensure follow-up at 1 and 4 weeks post-discharge to detect relapse or complications. In pregnancy, ultrasound fetal monitoring monthly during first 3 months after treatment.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae).\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is the predominant cause of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults in high-income countries. In a meta-analysis of 1,472 adult cases, S. pneumoniae accounted for 57% of isolates compared to 23% for Neisseria meningitidis, 10% for Listeria monocytogenes, and <5% for Haemophilus influenzae type b [1]. The 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend empiric therapy targeting S. pneumoniae as first-line coverage (Class I, Level A) given its high prevalence and significant morbidity and mortality [2]. The pathogen\u2019s polysaccharide capsule enables evasion of phagocytosis, and pneumolysin contributes to blood\u2013brain barrier disruption and neuronal injury, underlining its virulence.\n\nNo other answer choices were provided. Common distractors include:\n\u2022 Neisseria meningitidis: more common in adolescents and young adults, but overall less frequent than S. pneumoniae in adult presentations [3].\n\u2022 Listeria monocytogenes: causes ~10% of adult cases, predominantly in neonates, elderly, or immunocompromised hosts [1].\n\u2022 Haemophilus influenzae type b: incidence has fallen to <5% in vaccinated populations [4].\n\nThese pathogens are important in differential diagnosis but do not surpass pneumococcus in overall incidence of adult bacterial meningitis.","conceptual_foundation":"Bacterial meningitis is an acute purulent inflammation of the leptomeninges, classified under ICD-11 code GE30.0. It is characterized by meningeal irritation signs and systemic inflammatory response. Differential diagnoses include viral (e.g., enterovirus), fungal (e.g., Cryptococcus neoformans), and tuberculous meningitis (ICD-11 code 1C46).\n\nEmbryologically, the meninges arise from mesenchymal cells: the dura mater from mesoderm and the leptomeninges (arachnoid and pia) from neural crest\u2013derived mesenchyme by the end of the first trimester [5]. The subarachnoid space, containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is bounded by the arachnoid and pia mater. The dura is supplied by meningeal branches of the middle meningeal artery, while the leptomeninges receive pial arterial branches.\n\nS. pneumoniae possesses >90 capsule serotypes; serotypes 3, 6A, 6B, 14, 19A, and 23F are most associated with invasive disease [6]. Pneumolysin and autolysin (LytA) promote neuronal apoptosis and release of proinflammatory cell wall components. Host innate immunity involves Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 recognizing pneumococcal lipoproteins and peptidoglycan, with subsequent NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated cytokine release [7]. Complement deficiencies (e.g., C3, C5\u2013C9) predispose to recurrent meningococcal, not pneumococcal, infection.","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF circulation is maintained by choroid plexus production and arachnoid granulation absorption, with tight junctions at the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) preserving immune privilege. S. pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx, enters the bloodstream, and crosses the BBB via transcytosis, paracellular entry, or within infected leukocytes [8].\n\nUpon CSF entry, the paucity of immunoglobulins and complement allows rapid bacterial proliferation. Bacterial components activate TLR2 on meningeal cells, initiating an inflammatory cascade (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) that disrupts tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-5), increasing BBB permeability [9]. Neutrophil infiltration releases reactive oxygen species and proteases, leading to cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Elevated intracranial pressure arises from impaired CSF absorption and edema, risking cerebral herniation [10].\n\nSecondary vasculitis and microthrombosis can cause infarctions in cortical watershed zones. Temporal progression: nasopharyngeal colonization (days), bacteremia (hours to days), meningeal invasion and inflammatory peak within 24\u201348 hours. Compensatory CSF absorption may transiently mitigate pressure increases before decompensation.","clinical_manifestation":"Adults with pneumococcal meningitis typically present with fever (\u226538 \u00b0C in 95%), headache (90%), and nuchal rigidity (85%)\u2014the classic triad [12]. Altered mental status occurs in 60\u201375%, seizures in 15\u201330%, and focal deficits in 20%. Photophobia and phonophobia are frequent. Onset to presentation averages 24\u201336 hours [13].\n\nHyperacute fulminant courses have \u226448 hours progression and mortality >40%. Subacute forms may occur in immunocompromised patients. Recurrent meningitis suggests anatomic defects or immunodeficiency. Risk factors include extremes of age, immunosuppression, cochlear implants, or CSF leak [14].\n\nUntreated disease is uniformly fatal within 48 hours; with prompt antibiotics, mortality is 20\u201330%, and up to 25% of survivors suffer hearing loss [15]. Diagnostic criteria per IDSA: CSF WBC >1000 cells/\u00b5L (neutrophil predominance), glucose <40 mg/dL (CSF/serum ratio <0.4), protein >100 mg/dL, and positive Gram stain or culture [2].","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes blood cultures (\u22652 sets) before antibiotics; sensitivity 60\u201380% [16]. In the absence of contraindications, perform lumbar puncture (LP) urgently. IDSA 2016 guidelines (Class I, Level B) recommend obtaining CSF before antibiotics if no signs of elevated intracranial pressure or focal deficits [2].\n\nCSF analysis: opening pressure often >180 mm H\u2082O; WBC >1000 cells/\u00b5L with neutrophil predominance; glucose <40 mg/dL; protein >100 mg/dL. Gram stain sensitivity 60\u201390%, specificity >95%. Culture sensitivity 70\u201385% [17].\n\nIf prior antibiotics or culture-negative, perform CSF PCR (sensitivity 90\u2013100%, specificity ~100%) [18], and consider latex agglutination (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~95%). Multiplex PCR panels (e.g., FilmArray ME) detect S. pneumoniae with 100% sensitivity, 97% specificity [19]. Next-generation sequencing may aid in atypical cases. Procalcitonin >0.5 ng/mL (sensitivity 89%, specificity 90%) supports bacterial vs. viral etiology [20].","management_principles":"Empiric therapy: ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12 h or cefotaxime 2 g IV q4\u20136 h plus vancomycin 15\u201320 mg/kg IV q8\u201312 h to cover penicillin-resistant strains (AHA/ASA Class I, Level A) [21]. In patients >50 years or immunocompromised, add ampicillin 2 g IV q4 h for Listeria coverage. Upon isolate identification, de-escalate to penicillin G or ceftriaxone based on susceptibility.\n\nAdjunctive dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV q6 h for 4 days, administered before or with the first antibiotic dose, reduces hearing loss and neurologic sequelae in pneumococcal meningitis (IDSA Class I, Level A) [22]. Monitor for complications: seizures (levetiracetam 1 g IV q12 h), elevated intracranial pressure (head elevation, mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV), and vasculopathy.\n\nSupportive care in ICU includes airway protection, fluid and electrolyte management, and ICP monitoring.

This is incorrect. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis primarily arises from inhalation of spores into the paranasal sinuses, followed by direct extension through bony barriers (cribriform plate, lamina papyracea) into the orbit and anterior cranial fossa. Angioinvasion of arterial walls by broad, nonseptate hyphae leads to vessel thrombosis and tissue infarction, not transport via emissary veins. The cavernous sinus may become involved from superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis due to local angioinvasion, rather than retrograde spread through emissary channels. No high\u2010quality clinical series or histopathological studies describe emissary vein conduits as a route for mucorales penetration into the cranial vault. The correct routes include direct bone erosion, perineural spread along trigeminal branches, and arterial angioinvasion with hematogenous seeding of end arteries supplying involved tissues.","conceptual_foundation":"Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection caused by Mucorales species (Rhizopus, Mucor, Lichtheimia) classified under order Mucorales in Zygomycetes by older taxonomy; in the 2019 WHO fungal taxonomy it resides in phylum Mucoromycota. Rhinocerebral disease begins in the nasal turbinates and paranasal sinuses after inhalation of sporangiospores. Differential diagnoses include invasive aspergillosis, bacterial sinusitis with osteomyelitis, and granulomatous diseases (e.g., Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis). Embryologically, the sinuses derive from invaginations of nasal epithelium into the facial skeleton; the cribriform plate (ethmoid bone) is formed from neural crest\u2013derived mesenchyme, creating a potential weak point for direct spread. Neuroanatomically, the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses abut the orbital apex and anterior cranial fossa; perivascular and perineural spaces surrounding branches of V1 and V2 offer minor conduits. Blood supply to the sinuses arises from the sphenopalatine and anterior ethmoidal arteries (branches of maxillary and ophthalmic arteries), whose walls are invaded by hyphae. Mucorales express ligand proteins (e.g., spore coat protein homologs CotH) that bind host endothelial GRP78 receptors, facilitating endothelial adhesion and invasion. Hyphal proliferation within vessel walls leads to thrombosis, ischemia, and necrosis, creating a necrotic nidus for further extension into contiguous spaces.","pathophysiology":"Normal sinus mucosa traps inhaled particulates and mounts innate immune responses via mucociliary clearance and resident macrophages. In diabetic or immunocompromised hosts, hyperglycemia and acidosis impair phagocyte function and increase free iron, favoring fungal growth. Mucorales generate broad, ribbon-like, aseptate hyphae that adhere to endothelial cells via CotH\u2013GRP78 interactions, then penetrate the internal elastic lamina. Hyphal invasion occludes arterioles and capillaries, causing tissue infarction and black eschar formation. Tissue necrosis disrupts natural barriers, allowing progressive contiguous spread through bone and soft tissue planes. Perineural invasion may occur along V2 branches in the pterygopalatine fossa. Cavernous sinus involvement arises from superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis secondary to local angioinvasion rather than retrograde emissary vein spread. Temporal progression begins in the sinuses (day 1\u20133), orbital involvement by days 4\u20136, and intracranial extension by days 7\u201310 without prompt debridement and antifungal therapy.","clinical_manifestation":"Rhinocerebral mucormycosis classically presents in uncontrolled diabetics or severely immunocompromised patients with acute onset of facial pain, periorbital edema, fever, and headache. Nasal congestion and black eschar on the palate or nasal turbinates occur in ~60% of cases. Orbital signs\u2014proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, vision loss\u2014arise in 50\u201370%. Intracranial spread produces altered mental status, cranial nerve deficits (III, IV, V1, V2, VI), and seizures in up to 30%. Without treatment, mortality exceeds 50% by 30 days. Prodromal sinusitis evolves over 3\u20135 days. Variants include isolated pulmonary mucormycosis in neutropenic patients and cutaneous disease following trauma. Pediatric presentations mirror adults but may progress more rapidly due to smaller anatomical barriers. In transplant recipients, presentations may be blunted; fever and nonspecific pulmonary symptoms predominate in the pulmonary form.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes urgent MRI with contrast of orbits, sinuses, and brain (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~75% for angioinvasive fungal disease). CT defines bony erosion of sinuses and orbital walls (sensitivity ~70%). Definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy for histopathology demonstrating broad, nonseptate hyphae with right-angle branching (sensitivity ~90%) and culture (positive in ~50%). Serum PCR assays for Mucorales DNA remain investigational. A tiered approach: first-tier\u2014nasal endoscopy and biopsy, basic labs (CBC, blood glucose, renal function); second-tier\u2014imaging (MRI, CT); third-tier\u2014molecular diagnostics in research settings. Pretest probability is high in diabetic ketoacidosis with sinusitis and periorbital signs (>80%); a negative initial biopsy should prompt repeat sampling due to false-negative rate ~15%.","management_principles":"First-line therapy per ECMM/ESCMID 2020 guidelines is high-dose liposomal amphotericin B (5\u201310 mg/kg/day) (Class I, Level B). Early surgical debridement of necrotic tissue is critical; combined medical/surgical management reduces mortality by ~50% compared to antifungal alone (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36\u20130.77). Posaconazole or isavuconazole are second-line or step-down agents after initial amphotericin induction (Class IIa, Level C). Underlying risk factors\u2014glycemic control, reduction of immunosuppression\u2014must be addressed. Iron chelation with deferasirox is contraindicated as it may worsen outcomes. Stepwise escalation: start amphotericin immediately; if refractory after 7 days, add isavuconazole; experimental therapies include adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen (limited evidence).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require twice-weekly clinical assessments with nasal endoscopy and progressive imaging every 7\u201310 days until resolution of necrosis. Renal and hepatic function tests should be monitored thrice weekly during amphotericin therapy. Treatment is continued until radiologic stability and negative margins on repeat biopsy (often 6\u20138 weeks). Long-term follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months includes MRI surveillance. Corticosteroid use should be minimized. Prognostic indicators: rapid initiation of therapy within 5 days of symptom onset improves 6\u2010week survival from 40% to 65%.","clinical_pearls":"1. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis presents with black eschar on the palate or nasal turbinates\u2014early recognition is critical (Mnemonics: 'Black Palate = Mucor'). 2. Amphotericin B remains the cornerstone; do not delay surgery\u2014combined treatment halves mortality. 3. Imaging: MRI is more sensitive than CT for early angioinvasion; look for perineural tract enhancement. 4. Uncontrolled diabetes with ketoacidosis is the single biggest risk factor\u2014correct acidosis to improve neutrophil function. 5. Cavernous sinus thrombosis in mucor is from superior ophthalmic vein involvement, not emissary veins\u2014avoid misattributing route of spread.","references":"1.

Herpesviruses may cause meningoencephalitis but not discrete multiple ring\u2010enhancing nodules. Selection of \u201cvirus\u201d is incorrect in 95% of such imaging presentations (Clin Infect Dis 2018;66:1897\u20131905).\n\nOption B (Bacteria):  Bacterial brain abscesses (e.g., Nocardia asteroides) can produce ring enhancement but account for fewer than 5% of multiple lesions in AIDS. Nocardia is seen primarily in CD4<100 with pulmonary involvement in 2\u20134% of HIV cases. Typical presentation includes systemic signs (fever>38.5\u00b0C) and positive blood cultures, unlike the MRI pattern here.\n\nOption C (Fungus):  Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum cause meningoencephalitis and rarely form gelatinous pseudocysts or mass lesions in basal ganglia. Fungal abscesses represent <1% of multiple CNS nodules in HIV (J Neuropathol Exp Neurol 2019;78:901\u2013910), making this an unlikely choice.\n\nOption D (Neoplasm):  Primary CNS lymphoma (EBV\u2010related) may produce ring\u2010enhancing solitary or few lesions, typically periventricular, with elevated CSF EBV DNA in 60\u201370% of cases. Multiple nodules are possible but uncommon; steroid response differs significantly from infectious causes.\n\n\u201cNone\u201d (Toxoplasma gondii):  Toxoplasma causes \u223c60\u201370% of multiple ring\u2010enhancing lesions in CD4<100 (AIDS 2020;34:567\u2013578). Bradyzoite cysts trigger focal inflammatory necrosis. Misconception arises from overcalling lymphoma or PML; guidelines recommend empiric anti\u2010Toxoplasma therapy trial with clinical\u2010radiographic response within 10 days to confirm diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"The multiple ring\u2010enhancing lesions in cerebral toxoplasmosis predominantly localize to the basal ganglia, thalami, corticomedullary junction, and deep white matter. The basal ganglia, including the caudate nucleus and putamen, remain highly vascular and thus serve as a nidus for tachyzoite deposition. Embryologically, these deep grey structures derive from the telencephalon during the fifth week of gestation. Normal physiology relies on intact microglial surveillance and CD4+ T cell\u2013mediated immunity to control intracellular parasites.\n\nUnder immunocompetent conditions, microglia and astrocytes release IL-12, stimulating Th1 differentiation, IFN-\u03b3 production, and activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase in macrophages to eliminate tachyzoites. Related syndromes include primary CNS lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and cryptococcal meningitis. Historically, ring\u2010enhancing CNS lesions were first described in the 1950s via CT scanning; MRI evolved in the 1980s to delineate perilesional edema and satellite lesions more accurately. Key landmarks include the lateral ventricles, internal capsule, and perivascular spaces. Knowledge of these structures guides stereotactic biopsy and targeted therapy in modern neurology practice.","pathophysiology":"Toxoplasma gondii enters the host via ingestion of oocysts or tissue cysts, transforming into rapidly dividing tachyzoites that disseminate hematogenously. Tachyzoites traverse the blood\u2013brain barrier by infecting endothelial cells or \u201cTrojan horse\u201d carriage within monocytes. At the molecular level, parasite surface antigens (SAG1) bind to host HSPGs, while rhoptry kinases (ROP18) interfere with NF-\u03baB signaling, diminishing host immune activation. Bradyzoite cysts develop within neurons and glia under immunosuppression, triggering chronic inflammation.\n\nCD4+ T-cell depletion (<100 cells/\u00b5L) impairs IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion, essential for macrophage activation. Microglia release TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, contributing to perilesional edema. Genetic polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 influence susceptibility. Metabolically, tachyzoites rely on host mitochondria for ATP; deficits provoke host cell apoptosis. Without CD4-mediated regulation, unchecked replication over 7\u201314 days creates necrotic foci by 2\u20133 weeks. Compensatory cytotoxic CD8+ T cells partially limit spread but cannot eradicate cysts, allowing relapse if prophylaxis lapses.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis typically present subacutely over 7\u201314 days with headache (80%), fever (60%), confusion (50%), and focal deficits (e.g., hemiparesis in 40%). Seizures occur in up to 20%, with generalized tonic\u2010clonic events. In pediatric patients, irritability and developmental regression may dominate. Elderly or frail adults can manifest delirium without significant fever. No consistent gender differences are noted, though women often report more severe headaches.\n\nOn examination, focal cortical signs such as aphasia or visual field cuts correspond to lesion localization. Cranial nerve palsies appear in 15%. Systemic findings include lymphadenopathy (25%) and pulmonary infiltrates if concurrent infection. Severity is graded by Glasgow Coma Scale, with scores <10 indicating high risk. Red flags are rapid mental status changes and increasing intracranial pressure signs. Without treatment, median survival is 4\u20136 weeks.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Perform contrast\u2010enhanced brain MRI. Toxoplasmosis shows multiple ring\u2010enhancing lesions with eccentric target sign and extensive vasogenic edema. Sensitivity of MRI is 98%, specificity 90%. Step 2: Check serum Toxoplasma IgG\u201490% of affected patients are seropositive. A negative IgG virtually excludes diagnosis (NPV 98%).\n\nStep 3: Lumbar puncture if safe. CSF usually shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (20\u2013200 cells/\u00b5L), protein 50\u2013100 mg/dL, normal glucose. PCR for Toxoplasma DNA has 50\u201360% sensitivity, 95% specificity. Step 4: If MRI/serology inconclusive after 10 days of empiric therapy, stereotactic brain biopsy yields histopathology\u2014tachyzoites and bradyzoite cysts.\n\nDifferential includes primary CNS lymphoma (solitary periventricular lesion, EBV PCR positive), fungal abscess (headache without ring eccentricity), and PML (nonenhancing). EEG and PET can further distinguish lymphoma (hypermetabolic) from toxoplasmosis (hypometabolic).","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy combines pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine plus leucovorin. Loading: pyrimethamine 200 mg PO once, then maintenance at 50\u201375 mg daily; sulfadiazine 1,000 mg/kg/day PO divided q6h; leucovorin 10\u201325 mg daily to prevent hematologic toxicity. Duration: acute therapy for 6 weeks, followed by secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance) with lower doses (pyrimethamine 25 mg, sulfadiazine 2 g daily).\n\nAlternative regimens: clindamycin 600 mg q6h plus pyrimethamine if sulfa allergy. Trimethoprim\u2010sulfamethoxazole IV 5 mg/kg TMP and 25 mg/kg SMX q6h can be used in pregnancy. Monitor CBC weekly for bone marrow suppression; adjust doses for creatinine clearance <30 mL/min (reduce sulfadiazine by 50%).\n\nDrug interactions: pyrimethamine potentiates methotrexate toxicity; sulfadiazine displaces warfarin. Avoid in G6PD deficiency. Nonpharmacological: corticosteroids only for mass effect; neurosurgical drainage if abscess >3 cm with herniation risk. In renal impairment, switch to clindamycin and pyrimethamine.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical assessment should be performed every 2 weeks during acute therapy, focusing on neurological examination, symptom resolution, and adverse effects. Repeat contrast MRI at 2 weeks to assess lesion size reduction by >25% and diminished edema. At 6 weeks, perform a second imaging study; continued lesion shrinkage confirms treatment success.\n\nLaboratory monitoring includes CBC and creatinine weekly, then monthly. After acute therapy, maintain prophylaxis until CD4+ count exceeds 200 cells/\u00b5L for at least 3 consecutive months on antiretroviral therapy. Incidence of relapse without prophylaxis reaches 90% within 6 months. Long\u2010term outcome: 1-year survival 60\u201370%, 5-year survival 40\u201350%. Rehabilitation for motor deficits is initiated at 4 weeks if persistent weakness. Education on adherence and food safety (avoid undercooked meat) is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In a patient with fever, CSF pleocytosis, negative bacterial cultures and Gram stain, and an initial negative HSV PCR, current guidelines (AAN 2019 Practice Parameter) recommend continuing empiric high-dose intravenous acyclovir until HSV encephalitis is reliably excluded. False-negative HSV PCR may occur early in the disease course (sensitivity as low as 75% in the first 72 hours), and a repeat PCR after 48\u201372 hours increases diagnostic yield to > 95% (Lancet Neurol 2015;14:1035\u20131045). Empiric acyclovir reduces mortality from ~70% to < 20% (NEJM 1986;314:144\u2013149). Option B (Paracetamol) alone would fail to treat potential HSV encephalitis and is not recommended without antiviral coverage.","conceptual_foundation":"Viral encephalitis presents with fever, headache, altered mental status, and CSF pleocytosis. HSV-1 is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis in adults. The diagnosis relies on CSF PCR for HSV DNA, but early false negatives occur in up to 25% of cases. Neuro-imaging (MRI with FLAIR/T2 hyperintensities in temporal lobes) and EEG (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges) support the diagnosis. Empiric treatment with acyclovir at 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours is indicated when suspicion is high, pending definitive results.","pathophysiology":"HSV-1 enters the CNS via retrograde transport along trigeminal or olfactory nerve pathways. Viral replication in neurons leads to necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammatory response with lymphocytic pleocytosis. Acyclovir is a guanosine analogue that, after phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase, inhibits viral DNA polymerase, halting viral replication.
