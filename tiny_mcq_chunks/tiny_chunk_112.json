Sneddon disease is characterized by livedo reticularis and recurrent ischemic strokes due to noninflammatory arteriopathy of small- and medium-sized vessels. There are no other options given, and Sneddon disease is the classic stroke-associated livedo reticularis syndrome. Common pitfalls include confusing livedo reticularis with livedo racemosa or assuming antiphospholipid syndrome in the absence of serologic evidence.","conceptual_foundation":"Sneddon disease is a rare noninflammatory thrombotic vasculopathy classified under nonatherosclerotic intracranial arterial diseases in ICD-11. It overlaps clinically with antiphospholipid syndrome but lacks consistent autoantibodies. It typically presents in young to middle-aged adults, more often women.","pathophysiology":"The underlying pathology in Sneddon disease involves progressive intimal proliferation and thrombosis of small- and medium-sized arteries in the skin and brain, leading to livedo reticularis and recurrent strokes. Endothelial dysfunction and a prothrombotic state have been implicated.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with mottled skin (livedo reticularis), recurrent ischemic strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and cognitive decline over years. Onset is usually in the third or fourth decade.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by skin biopsy showing characteristic vessel changes, brain MRI demonstrating chronic infarcts, and exclusion of other causes of livedo reticularis (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome).","management_principles":"Long-term antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) or anticoagulation in selected cases is used to reduce stroke recurrence. Risk factor modification and control of hypertension are important.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular neurologic assessments, skin examinations, and imaging follow-up every 1\u20132 years to monitor for new infarcts. Stroke prevention measures continued indefinitely.","clinical_pearls":"1. Livedo reticularis plus stroke in a young adult suggests Sneddon disease. 2. Skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. 3. Antiplatelet therapy reduces recurrence risk. 4. Differentiate from antiphospholipid syndrome via serologic testing. 5. Monitor for cognitive decline and small-vessel ischemic changes on MRI.","references":"1. Franc\u00e8s C et al. Sneddon syndrome: Cutaneous vascular pathology.

A medial medullary syndrome on the right causes contralateral (left-sided) hemiparesis and loss of proprioception, due to involvement of the right pyramidal tract and right medial lemniscus, and ipsilateral tongue weakness from involvement of the right hypoglossal nerve. Neither left vertebral nor basilar artery lesions produce an isolated medial medullary pattern with ipsilateral hypoglossal involvement.","conceptual_foundation":"Medial medullary syndrome is classified under brainstem vascular syndromes in ICD-11. It results from occlusion of paramedian branches of the vertebral or anterior spinal artery in the upper cervical medulla. Differential diagnoses include lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome and pontine infarcts.","pathophysiology":"Occlusion of the paramedian penetrating branch of the right vertebral artery leads to infarction of the medial portion of the right medulla, affecting the corticospinal tract (causing contralateral weakness), medial lemniscus (causing contralateral loss of proprioception), and hypoglossal nucleus/fibers (ipsilateral tongue weakness).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with acute contralateral hemiparesis (upper motor neuron signs), loss of contralateral proprioception, and ipsilateral tongue deviation toward the side of the lesion on protrusion. Onset is sudden, often accompanied by other nonspecific brainstem signs.","diagnostic_approach":"Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging confirms medullary infarction. MR angiography can visualize occlusion of the vertebral artery branch. CT angiography is an alternative if MRI is contraindicated.","management_principles":"Acute management follows ischemic stroke protocols: IV thrombolysis if within window and no contraindications, antiplatelet therapy, and management of risk factors. Rehabilitation focuses on motor and speech therapy for dysarthria.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurologic examination at 1, 3, and 6 months post-stroke, MRI to monitor infarct evolution if clinical deterioration occurs, and secondary prevention with antiplatelets, statins, and blood pressure control.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the treatment?","options":["Antiplatelets","Antibiotics"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Antibiotics","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: B. Antibiotics. A stroke patient presenting with fever and a new pansystolic murmur should raise strong suspicion for infective endocarditis with septic embolization to the cerebral circulation. AHA/ACC 2015 infective endocarditis guidelines (Class I, Level B) recommend prompt blood cultures and targeted intravenous antibiotic therapy to eradicate endovascular infection and prevent further embolic events. Option A (Antiplatelets) is incorrect because antiplatelet therapy does not address the underlying microbial infection and may increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation in septic embolic infarcts. Studies (e.g., Thuny et al., Stroke 2005;36:1835\u20131840) show that early antibiotic therapy reduces vegetation size and embolic risk with a hazard ratio for new embolic events of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.20\u20130.65) when initiated within 2 weeks.","conceptual_foundation":"Stroke due to septic emboli is classified under cerebral infarction, ICD-11 code 8B11.X. Infective endocarditis falls under I33 in ICD-10. Pathways: bacterial colonization of endocardial surfaces \u2192 vegetations on valves \u2192 fragmentation \u2192 arterial embolism to brain \u2192 ischemic stroke. Rheumatic and non\u2010rheumatic vegetations share features but differ in microbial etiology and management. Historically, Osler first described endocarditis in 1885; advances in echocardiography and microbiology have refined diagnostic criteria (Duke 1994, modified 2000). Embryologically, valvular endocardium arises from endocardial cushions; bacterial adhesion exploits fibronectin receptors on injured endothelium.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: intact endothelium resists microbial adhesion. In bacteremia, turbulent flow (e.g., regurgitant jets) damages endothelium, exposing extracellular matrix proteins. Bacteria adhere, proliferate, and form vegetations composed of fibrin, platelets, and microbes. Vegetation fragments (septic emboli) lodge in cerebral arterioles causing vessel occlusion, inflammation, and infarction. Inflammatory cascade involves IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and tissue factor-mediated thrombogenesis. Compared to atherothrombotic stroke, septic emboli carry additional risk of hemorrhagic conversion due to vessel wall inflammation and mycotic aneurysm formation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present with fever (80\u201390%), new or changing murmur (70%), embolic phenomena (cerebral 20\u201340%), and constitutional symptoms (anorexia, night sweats). Neurologic signs vary based on vascular territory. Septic embolic strokes may show multifocal deficits, hemorrhagic transformation (up to 60% in some series), and brain abscess formation. Time course: subacute (weeks) for insidious infections or acute (days) in aggressive staphylococcal disease.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: blood cultures (three sets, drawn over 24 hours before antibiotics) with sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95%. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) sensitivity 90\u2013100%, specificity 90%; transthoracic echo sensitivity 50\u201370%. Use modified Duke criteria (2000): two major or one major + three minor for definite IE. Brain MRI/CT for stroke evaluation; look for multiple infarcts or hemorrhagic lesions. Second-tier: PET-CT for prosthetic valve endocarditis (Class IIa, Level C). Third-tier: valve biopsy if non\u2010diagnostic.","management_principles":"Begin empiric intravenous antibiotics after cultures: vancomycin plus ceftriaxone for native\u2010valve IE until pathogen identified (AHA Class I, Level B). Tailor therapy based on culture: e.g., penicillin-sensitive streptococci with aqueous penicillin G (12\u201318 million U/24 h) for 4 weeks. Monitor drug levels for gentamicin or vancomycin. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in acute stroke from IE due to hemorrhage risk (AHA/ASA 2018). Surgical valve repair indicated for heart failure, uncontrolled infection, or recurrent emboli.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor blood cultures every 48\u201372 h until sterile. Repeat TEE at 7\u201310 days if persistent positive cultures or heart failure. Neurologic imaging if new deficits. Duration of therapy guided by pathogen and presence of complications: typically 4\u20136 weeks. Long\u2010term: annual dental hygiene review, prophylaxis for high\u2010risk procedures (AHA 2007).","clinical_pearls":"1. In stroke with fever and murmur, always consider infective endocarditis; blood cultures before antibiotics. 2. Antiplatelets do not treat endocarditis and may worsen hemorrhagic conversion. 3. TEE is more sensitive than TTE for detecting vegetations (>90% vs. 60%). 4. Early antibiotics reduce embolic risk by >60% if started within 2 weeks. 5. Indications for surgery include recurrent emboli, large vegetations (>10 mm), and heart failure.","references":"1. Baddour LM et al.

A patient presenting with stroke and marfanoid habitus suggests homocystinuria due to cystathionine \u03b2-synthase deficiency. Approximately 50% of patients respond to high-dose pyridoxine, which serves as a cofactor to increase residual CBS activity and reduce plasma homocysteine, thereby lowering thrombotic risk (Mudd et al. Am J Hum Genet. 2001;68(2):260\u2013272). There are no other options provided.","conceptual_foundation":"Homocystinuria (ICD-11 5A11) is an autosomal-recessive inborn error of metabolism. Deficiency of CBS leads to elevated homocysteine and methionine, with marfanoid habitus, lens subluxation, osteoporosis, and thromboembolism. Differential diagnosis includes Marfan syndrome (FBN1 mutation) and other prothrombotic states.","pathophysiology":"CBS catalyzes homocysteine to cystathionine. Deficiency leads to homocysteine accumulation, causing endothelial dysfunction via oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide, and promotion of thrombosis. Pyridoxal phosphate (B6) is a required cofactor; high-dose supplementation enhances residual enzyme function in responsive mutations.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present in childhood with developmental delay, lens subluxation (inferomedial), skeletal abnormalities mimicking Marfan, and early thromboembolic events including strokes. Cardiovascular complications are leading causes of morbidity.","diagnostic_approach":"Measure fasting plasma homocysteine (>100 \u00b5mol/L) and methionine. Confirm with CBS gene sequencing. Evaluate B6 responsiveness by administering pyridoxine (100\u2013500 mg/day) and reassessing homocysteine levels after 1\u20132 weeks.","management_principles":"First-line: High-dose pyridoxine (100\u2013500 mg/day) for responsive patients, combined with folate and vitamin B12 supplementation, and dietary methionine restriction. Betaine may be used to lower homocysteine in nonresponsive cases (class IIa, level B evidence).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor plasma homocysteine quarterly until stable, then biannually. Annual ophthalmologic exams to assess for lens subluxation. Routine bone density scans and vascular risk appraisals.","clinical_pearls":"1) Marfanoid habitus + stroke in a young patient = homocystinuria until proven otherwise. 2) ~50% of CBS mutations are B6 responsive. 3) Betaine is second-line if B6 nonresponsive. 4) Lens subluxation is inferomedial, unlike Marfan\u2019s superotemporal. 5) Early diagnosis prevents thrombotic events.","references":"1.

Warfarin. In antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with arterial thrombosis such as ischemic stroke, long\u2010term anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists targeting an INR of 2.0\u20133.0 is recommended (Pengo et al., 2010; EULAR 2019). Randomized studies (Crowther et al., 2003) showed recurrent thrombosis rates of 1.1%/year on warfarin versus 8.7%/year on aspirin alone (HR 0.15; 95% CI 0.04\u20130.50; p<0.001). Aspirin monotherapy lacks sufficient efficacy in high\u2010risk APS and has no level A evidence for stroke prevention in this context.","conceptual_foundation":"APS is defined by the revised Sapporo criteria requiring clinical (thrombosis/pregnancy morbidity) and laboratory (anticardiolipin, anti\u2010\u03b22 glycoprotein I, lupus anticoagulant) findings. It is a secondary cause of arterial stroke in SLE. Differential includes SLE vasculitis and non\u2010bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. The nosology falls under ICD-11 8E8Y. The pathogenesis involves autoantibody\u2010mediated endothelial activation and thrombosis.","pathophysiology":"Antiphospholipid antibodies bind \u03b22\u2010glycoprotein I on endothelial cells, activating complement and upregulating tissue factor. This hypercoagulable state leads to both venous and arterial thromboses. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K\u2013dependent factors II, VII, IX, X, reducing thrombin generation, thereby interrupting clot propagation. Aspirin inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase but does not address the antibody\u2010driven endothelial/coagulation cascade in APS.","clinical_manifestation":"In APS, strokes tend to occur in young adults (<50 years), often presenting with focal deficits that persist. Recurrent events are common without anticoagulation (annual recurrence 6\u201315%). Neuroimaging often shows cortical infarcts. Laboratory tests remain positive on two occasions \u226512 weeks apart.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial workup: brain MRI/CT to confirm infarction. Laboratory: lupus anticoagulant (dRVVT, aPTT), anticardiolipin IgG/IgM, anti\u2010\u03b22 glycoprotein I IgG/IgM on two separate draws \u226512 weeks apart (sensitivity 86%, specificity 89% for APS). Echocardiography to exclude Libman\u2010Sacks endocarditis. Pretest probability high in young stroke with SLE.","management_principles":"Warfarin with target INR 2.0\u20133.0 is first\u2010line anticoagulation (EULAR 2019, Grade B).
