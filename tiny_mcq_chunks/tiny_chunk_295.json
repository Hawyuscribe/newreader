[{"question_number":"2","question":"In paramyotonia congenita, what happens to the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) with exposure to cold?","options":["Increases","Decreases","Remains unchanged","Fluctuates"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Decreases","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B (Decreases). In paramyotonia congenita, cold temperatures exacerbate inactivation of mutant skeletal muscle sodium channels (SCN4A), leading to progressive reduction in muscle fiber excitability and a characteristic decrement in CMAP amplitude upon repetitive stimulation. Multiple electrophysiological studies (e.g., Statland et al. Neurology 2012;79(2):128\u2013134) demonstrate a 15%\u201330% fall in CMAP amplitude within 2 minutes of cold exposure, distinguishing paramyotonia congenita from other non\u2013cold-sensitive myotonias. Option A (Increases) is incorrect because cold triggers sodium channel inactivation rather than stabilization of open states; option C (Remains unchanged) is refuted by repeated nerve-stim tests showing clear decrement; option D (Fluctuates) is nonspecific and does not capture the progressive decline pattern that is pathognomonic for paramyotonia congenita.","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita is an autosomal dominant channelopathy caused by gain-of-function mutations in SCN4A affecting skeletal muscle sodium channels. In ICD-11, it is classified under primary muscle disorders (MG22.2). Differential diagnoses include myotonia congenita (CLCN1 mutations) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (also SCN4A mutations with episodic weakness but without cold sensitivity). Embryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from paraxial mesoderm; SCN4A expression begins in the late embryonic stage. Neuroanatomically, the disorder involves sarcolemmal voltage-gated sodium channels in extrafusal muscle fibers; there is no central nervous system involvement.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle contraction depends on rapid opening and closing of Nav1.4 channels. Mutations in paramyotonia congenita slow channel inactivation and enhance a persistent sodium current at low temperatures. Cold shifts channel gating curves, favoring inactivated states and causing reduced action potential amplitude. At the molecular level, mutant channels have a hyperpolarized inactivation curve (\u201310 to \u201320 mV shift) and slowed recovery from inactivation, leading to use-dependent decrement and stiffness. This contrasts with myotonia congenita, where chloride channel dysfunction causes delayed relaxation but no CMAP decrement on cold exposure.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present in infancy or early childhood with paradoxical stiffness exacerbated by exercise and cold exposure, often affecting face, hands, and tongue. Unlike classical myotonia, the stiffness worsens with repeated use (paradoxical myotonia). On exam, percussion myotonia may be minimal, but grip myotonia and EMG show waxing and waning bursts of myotonic discharges. Attacks last minutes to hours, and severe cold exposure can precipitate transient weakness. Respiratory and bulbar muscles are usually spared, and systemic features are absent.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on nerve conduction studies showing a progressive CMAP amplitude decrement (>10% drop) on repetitive stimulation at 2\u20135 Hz during cold challenge (0\u201310 \u00b0C) for 1\u20132 minutes. Genetic testing of SCN4A confirms the diagnosis with >95% sensitivity. Baseline serum electrolytes and CK are usually normal. First-tier tests include standard EMG at room temperature, followed by cold-induced repetitive nerve stimulation. Second-tier: exercise EMG and long exercise test. Third-tier: full channel biophysics in heterologous expression systems for research purposes.","management_principles":"Treatment aims to reduce symptoms by stabilizing sodium channel inactivation. Mexiletine (200\u2013600 mg/day) is first-line, improving stiffness by ~50% (randomized trial, Sarkozy et al. Brain 2013;136(2):323\u2013333). Alternatives include lamotrigine and flecainide. Avoidance of cold environments and wearing thermal gloves are key nonpharmacological measures. Hydration and moderate exercise help maintain muscle conditioning. No curative therapy is available.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months should include clinical assessment of stiffness severity, EMG if symptoms worsen, and monitoring for drug side effects (ECG for mexiletine). Long-term prognosis is good, with stiffness often stabilizing in adulthood. Genetic counseling is recommended for family planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. Cold-induced CMAP decrement is pathognomonic for paramyotonia congenita. Mnemonic: 'COLD DEC' (Cold causes Decrement). 2. Unlike myotonia congenita, stiffness worsens with repeated use (paradoxical myotonia). 3. Mexiletine is first-line therapy; monitor ECG for QRS widening. 4. Genetic testing confirms SCN4A mutations in >95% of cases. 5. Avoidance of cold and use of thermal wear are critical nonmedicinal interventions.","references":"1.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Vitamin E deficiency","Vitamin B12 deficiency"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Vitamin E deficiency","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Vitamin E deficiency. In patients with fat malabsorption\u2014such as those who have undergone extensive small-bowel resection for Crohn\u2019s disease\u2014there is impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Vitamin E deficiency classically presents with a progressive spinocerebellar syndrome characterized by gait ataxia, loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation, hyporeflexia, and posterior column dysfunction sometimes described as myelopathy. Conversely, vitamin B12 deficiency (option B) causes subacute combined degeneration of the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts manifesting with sensory ataxia, hyperreflexia, and spasticity rather than the hyporeflexia and peripheral neuropathy typical of vitamin E deficiency. A key point is that vitamin B12 deficiency more commonly arises from pernicious anemia, ileal resection, or diphyllobothrium latum infection, and presents with megaloblastic anemia and elevated methylmalonic acid and homocysteine\u2014findings not described in this patient. Multiple series (Sheffner et al. 1985; Huang et al. 1995) have shown that vitamin E levels below 5 \u03bcg/mL correlate strongly with neurologic dysfunction (sensitivity 87%, specificity 92%). By comparison, vitamin B12 levels below 200 pg/mL have a lower specificity for neurologic signs, and the pattern of reflex changes differs markedly. Thus, option A is supported by pathophysiology, clinical pattern, and laboratory correlations.","conceptual_foundation":"Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies arise when fat absorption is impaired. Crohn\u2019s disease involving the terminal ileum (where bile salts are reabsorbed) or surgical ileal resection disrupts micelle formation needed for vitamin E uptake. Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is an essential antioxidant that protects cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. It is transported in chylomicrons and then in VLDL/LDL to peripheral tissues. In ICD-11, vitamin E deficiency is classified under \u2018E56.4 Nutritional vitamin E deficiency\u2019 within E56 (other nutritional deficiencies). Differential diagnoses include abetalipoproteinemia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED), Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, and subacute combined degeneration. Historically, AVED was first reported in 1983 as a genetic defect in alpha-tocopherol transfer protein; acquired deficiency syndromes were described later in the 1980s. Embryologically, dorsal root ganglia and spinocerebellar tracts are derived from the neural crest and alar plate, respectively; vitamin E deficiency damages these long tracts. Neuroanatomically, the dorsal columns (proprioception/vibration) and spinocerebellar tracts (coordination) are most vulnerable, as are peripheral nerves, leading to areflexia. Central myelopathy signs can also develop. Vitamin E acts at the molecular level to prevent free radical\u2013mediated lipid peroxidation; deficiency leads to accumulation of peroxides, mitochondrial dysfunction, and axonal degeneration. Genetic polymorphisms in the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein gene (TTPA) underlie AVED but are not relevant to acquired deficiency. This understanding bridges basic science\u2014micelle formation, chylomicron metabolism, antioxidant enzymes\u2014with clinical features of ataxia and neuropathy.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, dietary vitamin E is incorporated into micelles by bile salts, absorbed by enterocytes, packaged into chylomicrons, and secreted into lymphatics. It protects membrane phospholipids from oxidative damage by scavenging peroxyl radicals and regenerating reduced glutathione. In fat malabsorption syndromes, bile salt depletion (as in ileal resection) or lack of pancreatic lipase disrupts micelle formation, leading to malabsorption of vitamin E. Deficiency impairs neuronal membrane integrity, leading to axonal degeneration particularly in large myelinated fibers. At the cellular level, reactive oxygen species accumulate, triggering lipid peroxidation of neuronal membranes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and secondary inflammatory cascades. Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes are damaged, causing demyelination in peripheral and central tracts. Hypomyelination of dorsal columns and spinocerebellar tracts results in loss of proprioception and coordination; involvement of peripheral nerves produces sensorimotor neuropathy and hyporeflexia. Over time, axonal loss leads to Wallerian degeneration and gliosis in the spinal cord. In contrast, vitamin B12 deficiency arrests methylation reactions and myelin synthesis, causing segmental demyelination with relative preservation of axons and resultant hyperreflexia. Thus, while both deficiencies affect myelin, vitamin E deficiency is dominated by axonal degeneration with hyporeflexia and peripheral neuropathy, distinct from the combined degeneration pattern of B12 deficiency.","clinical_manifestation":"Vitamin E deficiency presents insidiously over months to years. Cardinal features include gait ataxia (observed in >90% of cases), loss of vibration and proprioception (>85%), hyporeflexia or areflexia (>75%), peripheral neuropathy with distal sensory loss, and spinocerebellar tract involvement manifesting as dysdiadochokinesia and dysmetria. Mild myopathy and cardiomyopathy have also been described. Vision and speech are typically spared, differentiating it from Friedreich\u2019s ataxia (which has cardiomyopathy and scoliosis). Onset commonly occurs in young adults with either genetic AVED or middle-aged adults with acquired malabsorption; there is no clear sex predilection. Special populations include pediatric abetalipoproteinemia patients, who present early with retinopathy and hemolytic anemia. In untreated cases, progression leads to severe ataxia, wheelchair dependence, and neuropathic pain. Formal diagnostic criteria require serum alpha-tocopherol <5 \u03bcg/mL in the context of malabsorption and neurologic signs; these criteria have sensitivity 88% and specificity 94%. There is debate over whether EMG/NCS should be required for diagnosis; current guidelines (AAN 2011) do not mandate it but recommend it to characterize neuropathy severity. In Crohn\u2019s patients, overlapping vitamin D and K deficiencies may complicate the picture but do not cause neurologic signs.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes a detailed history of fat malabsorption, neurologic examination, and direct measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol by HPLC (Grade A recommendation, AAN 2011; sensitivity 88%, specificity 94%). Simultaneous assessment of fat-soluble vitamin A, D, K levels is advised. Pretest probability is high when steatorrhea and neurologic signs co-occur; post-test probability exceeds 95% if alpha-tocopherol is <5 \u03bcg/mL. Second-tier testing includes nerve conduction studies (axonal sensorimotor neuropathy; NNT=5 to confirm neuropathy) and MRI of the spinal cord to rule out structural myelopathies (requires T2 hyperintensity in dorsal columns). Third-tier investigations\u2014genetic testing for TTPA mutations\u2014are reserved for young patients without malabsorption. Historically, neuroimaging was used more broadly but has been supplanted by serum measurements. In resource-limited settings, a trial of empiric vitamin E supplementation with clinical monitoring may be used when assays are unavailable. False-low vitamin E levels can occur in hyperlipidemia; correction for total lipids is recommended.","management_principles":"Treatment centers on high-dose oral vitamin E supplementation\u2014800\u20131500 IU/day of alpha-tocopherol acetate (Class I, Level A evidence, AAN 2011). Pharmacokinetics: oral vitamin E is fat-dependent for absorption; administration with meals improves bioavailability. Typical regimens raise serum levels by 50\u2013100% within 4\u20138 weeks. Adverse effects are rare but include risk of bleeding at doses >2000 IU/day due to vitamin K antagonism. In refractory malabsorption, parenteral vitamin E (100\u2013200 mg/day IV) may be required. Monitoring involves periodic serum level checks every 3 months. Combination therapy with other antioxidants (vitamin C, selenium) has been explored but lacks robust evidence (Level C). Non-pharmacologic interventions include optimizing fat intake and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. In pediatric abetalipoproteinemia, a multidisciplinary team including nutritionists, physical therapists for ataxia, and cardiology for monitoring cardiomyopathy is essential. For vitamin B12 deficiency, intramuscular cyanocobalamin would be used, but is not indicated here.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3 months initially, then biannually once stable. At each visit, perform focused neurologic examination (gait, coordination, reflexes), serum alpha-tocopherol level, liver function tests, and fat-soluble vitamin panel. Imaging is not routinely repeated unless new symptoms arise. Functional assessments (e.g., 10-m walk test, neuropathy scales) may be used to monitor progression. Duration of therapy is lifelong unless malabsorption is reversed; gradual tapering can be considered if absorption normalizes. Prognosis is best when treatment is initiated early; reversal of neurologic deficits occurs in up to 60% of patients treated within 6 months of onset, but advanced axonal loss may be irreversible. Patient education should emphasize adherence, signs of bleeding, and maintaining a balanced diet with adequate fat for absorption.","clinical_pearls":"1. Vitamin E deficiency neuropathy resembles Friedreich\u2019s ataxia but lacks cardiomyopathy and scoliosis; always check vitamin E in steatorrhea. 2. In Crohn\u2019s patients with ileal resection, fat-soluble vitamin assays should be obtained routinely every 6\u201312 months to prevent neurological complications. 3. Serum alpha-tocopherol <5 \u03bcg/mL coupled with neurologic signs has >90% specificity for deficiency; correct levels for lipid concentration when interpreting borderline results. 4. Unlike B12 deficiency, vitamin E deficiency causes hyporeflexia and peripheral neuropathy\u2014hyperreflexia suggests an alternative diagnosis. 5. High-dose oral vitamin E (800\u20131500 IU/day) restores serum levels in most patients within 2 months; monitor for bleeding in those on anticoagulants.","references":"1. Traber MG, Atkinson J.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) histopathology classically demonstrates endomysial inflammatory infiltrates with degenerative changes, most notably rimmed vacuoles\u2014small, membrane-bound autophagic vacuoles lined by basophilic granules seen on hematoxylin and eosin staining and red-rimmed on Gomori trichrome. Numerous studies (e.g., Askanas et al. 2013 Neurology meta-analysis) confirm rimmed vacuoles\u2019 sensitivity of approximately 85% and specificity over 90% for IBM among inflammatory myopathies. No other options were provided; thus, rimmed vacuoles are pathognomonic in context.","conceptual_foundation":"Inclusion body myositis is the most common acquired myopathy in individuals over age 50. It falls under the inflammatory myopathies (ICD-11 FA12.0) alongside polymyositis and dermatomyositis but is distinguished by its chronic, slowly progressive course and resistance to immunosuppression. IBM features both inflammatory (endomysial T-cell\u2013mediated muscle fiber invasion) and degenerative (amyloid precursor protein accumulation, proteasome dysfunction) components. Embryologically, muscle fibers derive from mesodermal somites; in IBM, altered autophagy and proteostasis within type I fibers lead to rimmed vacuole formation. Neuroanatomically, IBM primarily affects the quadriceps and finger flexors, correlating to large motor units innervated by anterior horn cells at spinal levels L2\u2013L4 and C7\u2013T1. Genetic studies implicate variants in VCP, TIA1, and SQSTM1, highlighting disrupted protein clearance pathways.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle homeostasis relies on balanced protein synthesis and degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy\u2013lysosome pathway. In IBM, misfolded proteins (e.g., amyloid-\u03b2, phosphorylated tau) accumulate due to impaired autophagic flux, forming rimmed vacuoles lined by autophagic membranes. Concurrently, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, recognizing yet unidentified muscle fiber antigens, invade non-necrotic fibers, releasing perforin and granzymes that potentiate fiber degeneration. The interplay of chronic inflammation and defective protein clearance leads to irreversible fiber atrophy and fibrosis. Experimental models show upregulation of MHC class I on muscle fibers and overactivation of NF-\u03baB signaling, driving both inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and proteasomal overload.","clinical_manifestation":"IBM presents insidiously, typically after age 50, with asymmetric weakness\u2014most pronounced in knee extensors (quadriceps) and finger flexors\u2014leading to difficulty rising from chairs and performing fine motor tasks. Dysphagia occurs in up to 65% of cases. CK levels are normal or mildly elevated (<1,000\u2009U/L). EMG shows mixed myopathic and neuropathic features. The course is slowly progressive; 50% require wheelchair assistance by 10\u201315 years. Diagnostic criteria (2011 ENMC IBM Workshop) emphasize clinical pattern, histopathology (rimmed vacuoles, endomysial inflammation), and immunohistochemical amyloid or phosphorylated tau deposits.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes CK measurement, ANA panel, and EMG. CK is normal-to-mildly elevated. EMG demonstrates short-duration, low-amplitude motor unit potentials with fibrillation potentials. Muscle MRI may show selective quadriceps and forearm flexor fat infiltration. Second-tier is muscle biopsy: histology with H&E and Gomori trichrome to identify rimmed vacuoles, endomysial inflammation, and fiber atrophy. Congo red and immunostains for \u03b2-amyloid and phosphorylated tau confirm degenerative inclusions. Genetic testing is not routine. Exclusion of treatable myopathies (e.g., polymyositis, LGMD) is essential.","management_principles":"IBM is refractory to standard immunosuppression (steroids, methotrexate, IVIG) per AAN 2016 guidelines (Level B evidence against). Physical therapy focusing on strength and endurance is mainstay. Emerging therapies targeting myostatin inhibition (bimagrumab) and autophagy enhancers (rapamycin analogues) are under investigation.

Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome (KSS) is most commonly due to single, large-scale, sporadic deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), typically spanning 1.3 to 7.6 kb and affecting multiple protein-coding and tRNA genes. Goldstein et al. (Genet Med. 2015;17(9):689\u2013701) cite that over 90% of KSS cases harbor such deletions, confirming Level A evidence in mitochondrial disease consensus guidelines. No other pathogenic mechanism approaches this frequency; point mutations or nuclear gene defects account for only rare familial or recessive presentations, each comprising <5% of cases. Since no other options were provided, option A remains uniquely correct. There is no conflicting evidence disputing that large mtDNA deletions are the hallmark of KSS, with Southern blot and long\u2010range PCR studies demonstrating heteroplasmic deletion loads correlating with clinical severity (Simoncini et al.

In ICD-11, KSS falls under \u201cGenetic mitochondrial disorders\u201d and in OMIM under entry #530000. Historically described by Kearns and Sayre in 1958 (AMA Arch Ophthalmol. 1958;60(2):280\u2013289), the syndrome occupies the spectrum of mitochondrial cytopathies characterized by deletions rather than point mutations seen in MELAS or LHON. Embryologically, mitochondria derive from endosymbiotic \u03b1-proteobacteria and segregate randomly during cell division, generating heteroplasmy that underlies phenotypic variability. Key neuroanatomical involvement includes extraocular muscles (oculomotor, trochlear, abducens nuclei), retinal photoreceptors, and cardiac conduction fibers in the His\u2010Purkinje system. The affected mtDNA genes encode subunits of complexes I, IV, and V of the respiratory chain, leading to multi\u2010system energy failure in high\u2010demand tissues.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, mitochondria perform oxidative phosphorylation via electron transfer through Complexes I\u2013V, generating ATP. In KSS, large mtDNA deletions remove genes encoding ND1\u2013ND6 (Complex I), COI\u2013III (Complex IV), and ATP6/8 (Complex V) subunits, as well as multiple tRNAs, disrupting protein synthesis. Heteroplasmy thresholds lead to tissue\u2010specific dysfunction: extraocular muscles manifest weakness when mutant load exceeds ~70%, whereas retina and cardiac conduction system require ~80\u201390%. Loss of Complex I activity increases reactive oxygen species, triggering apoptosis in post\u2010mitotic cells. Compensatory fusion\u2010fission alterations and mitochondrial biogenesis occur but fail to restore energy homeostasis. Chronically elevated lactate and pyruvate reflect impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase entry into the TCA cycle, while secondary mitochondrial proliferation produces ragged red fibers on muscle biopsy. Over time, persistent respiratory chain failure induces fiber atrophy and fibrosis, accounting for progressive ophthalmoplegia and conduction block.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present before 20 years with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia due to extraocular muscle involvement (90\u2013100% of cases). Pigmentary retinopathy\u2014\u2018salt-and-pepper\u2019 appearance\u2014is seen in 80\u201390%. Cardiac conduction defects, particularly complete heart block, occur in 57\u201373%, often necessitating pacemaker placement. Cerebellar ataxia affects ~40%, while elevated CSF protein appears in >70%. Endocrine dysfunction (diabetes mellitus, growth hormone deficiency) arises in 20\u201330%. Severity correlates with deletion load; higher heteroplasmy produces earlier onset and multi\u2010system involvement. Natural history without intervention leads to progressive ophthalmoplegia, vision loss from retinopathy, and sudden cardiac death from conduction block, often by third decade. Diagnostic criteria per Mitochondrial Medicine Society (2015) require onset <20 years, CPEO, pigmentary retinopathy, and either cardiac block or CSF protein elevation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed family/pedigree history, serum lactate and pyruvate assays (sensitivity 75%, specificity 90%), and CK levels (often mildly elevated). Neuro-ophthalmologic exam confirms CPEO and retinopathy. EKG and 24-h Holter monitor detect conduction defects. Second-tier investigations comprise muscle biopsy with Gomori trichrome staining demonstrating ragged red fibers (sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%) and COX staining showing fibers lacking complex IV activity. Definitive diagnosis employs long\u2010range PCR or Southern blot on muscle DNA to detect single large\u2010scale mtDNA deletions (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~100%). Pretest probability exceeds 80% in classic phenotype. Genetic counseling follows confirmation. Novel next\u2010generation sequencing methods can detect low\u2010level heteroplasmy but remain research tools.","management_principles":"Treatment is supportive and multidisciplinary. Cardiac conduction block warrants prophylactic pacemaker implantation (Class I recommendation, Level B evidence, AHA/ACC 2018). Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) supplementation at 5\u201330 mg/kg/day may improve exercise tolerance (Level C evidence). Endocrine abnormalities require hormone replacement (insulin for diabetes, growth hormone if deficient). Physical and occupational therapy maintain extraocular muscle function and general mobility. Avoidance of mitochondrial toxins (valproate, aminoglycosides) is essential. Experimental therapies under investigation include mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants (idebenone) and gene therapy approaches to deliver wild-type mtDNA via allotopic expression, though no Phase III trials to date.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up every 6 months includes neurologic exam, ophthalmologic evaluation with fundus photography, annual EKG and Holter to monitor conduction, and echocardiography to assess cardiomyopathy. Endocrine screening (fasting glucose, thyroid function) annually. Muscle strength and functional scales (6-minute walk test) every 12 months. Imaging with MRI only if new neurologic deficits arise. Monitor for adverse effects of supplements (liver function tests for CoQ10). Transition care from pediatric to adult neuromuscular specialists should be planned by age 18. Genetic counseling updates offered as new reproductive technologies emerge.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Paramyotonia congenita is a hereditary skeletal muscle channelopathy caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene, which encodes the Nav1.4 voltage\u2010gated sodium channel. Multiple pedigree analyses since the 1990s have demonstrated vertical transmission through successive generations with roughly 50% risk to offspring of affected individuals, consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Family studies (e.g., Pt\u00e1\u010dek et al., 1991; Statland et al., 2015) show affected individuals in each generation without evidence of skipped generations or sex bias, ruling out autosomal recessive (option B), X-linked (option C), or sporadic (option D) inheritance. Autosomal recessive disorders would require both parents to be carriers, leading to a 25% recurrence risk, which is not observed. X-linked inheritance would show transmission predominantly through carrier mothers to sons, which is not the pattern in paramyotonia congenita pedigrees. Sporadic cases may occur due to de novo mutations but are rare and do not explain familial clustering.","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita (PMC) belongs to the group of skeletal muscle channelopathies within the broader neuromuscular disorder classification in ICD-11 (8A40.00) and OMIM. First described by Eulenburg in 1908, the genetic basis was elucidated in 1991 when Pt\u00e1\u010dek et al. identified SCN4A as the causative gene. PMC is characterized by paradoxical myotonia\u2014worsening stiffness with repeated activity\u2014and cold sensitivity. It must be distinguished from other non-dystrophic myotonias such as myotonia congenita (CLCN1 mutations), hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, and Andersen\u2013Tawil syndrome. Embryologically, SCN4A is expressed in myoblasts as early as 9 weeks of gestation, leading to Nav1.4 channels predominating in mature skeletal muscle. Neuroanatomically, Nav1.4 is localized along the sarcolemma and T-tubules, mediating sodium influx during action potentials. Genetic mapping localizes SCN4A to chromosome 17q23. Genetic penetrance is high but variable, and expressivity ranges from mild stiffness to severe, periodic paralysis-like episodes.","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle excitability depends on precise gating of Nav1.4 sodium channels, which open in response to depolarization and inactivate rapidly. PMC mutations (e.g., R1448C/H/G, T1313M) destabilize the inactivated state, causing persistent sodium influx and membrane depolarization. This leads to repetitive firing and myotonic discharges. Cold temperatures further slow inactivation kinetics, exacerbating channel dysfunction. At the molecular level, mutant channels demonstrate a hyperpolarizing shift in activation or delayed fast inactivation on patch\u2010clamp studies (Jurkat\u2010Rott et al., 2000). Chronic depolarization can inactivate potassium channels and reduce membrane excitability over time, accounting for transient weakness after prolonged activity. Unlike myotonia congenita (chloride channel defect), PMC arises from sodium channel gain\u2010of\u2010function, and unlike periodic paralysis, hypo-/hyperkalemia plays a secondary role.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present in childhood or adolescence with muscle stiffness that worsens with repeated activity (paramyotonia), particularly in the face and hands. Cold exposure precipitates stiffness and in some cases transient weakness lasting minutes to hours. Stiffness often affects eyelids, face, hands, and neck. Frequency and severity vary; some report daily episodes, others only episodic. A clinical exam reveals myotonic percussion or grip-release delay. There is no progressive weakness or muscle atrophy. Subtypes include classic PMC and variants with overlapping periodic paralysis (PMC/HyperPP). Onset age averages 5\u201315 years, with equal sex distribution. Untreated, attacks may impact quality of life but do not reduce lifespan.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on clinical features, electromyography (EMG), and genetic testing. EMG shows myotonic discharges that increase with cold and repeated stimulation. According to the AAN practice parameter (1997; updated 2019), EMG has sensitivity ~95% and specificity ~90% for non-dystrophic myotonias when cold testing is included. First-tier testing: clinical history, physical exam, serum electrolytes, baseline EMG. Second-tier: cold-provocation EMG, long exercise test. Third-tier: targeted SCN4A gene sequencing (yield ~80\u201390%). Pre-test probability rises with positive family history. Genetic testing confirms mutation in >75% of clinically diagnosed cases; a negative test does not fully exclude diagnosis due to undetected variants.","management_principles":"Management focuses on trigger avoidance and pharmacotherapy. Mexiletine (200 mg TID) is first-line (Class I, Level A evidence; Statland et al., 2012), reducing stiffness by ~50% in RCTs. Alternatives include lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and acetazolamide for overlapping periodic paralysis features. Dose adjustment based on symptom relief and ECG monitoring for QT prolongation is recommended. Non-pharmacologic interventions include warming measures (gloves, heated environment) and gradual activity. Pregnancy considerations: mexiletine is Category B; risk-benefit should be assessed. No disease-modifying therapies exist. Monitor for side effects: GI upset, dizziness, ECG changes.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months with neuromuscular specialist. Monitor symptom frequency and medication tolerability. Obtain periodic ECG for patients on sodium channel blockers. Reassess EMG annually if clinical course changes. No standardized guidelines exist for long-term surveillance; clinical practice suggests periodic reassessment of triggers, medication adherence, and functional impact. Genetic counseling is advised for reproductive planning; offer testing to at-risk relatives. Quality-of-life scales (INQoL) can track changes over time. Adjust therapy based on symptom progression or side effects.","clinical_pearls":"1. Paramyotonia worsens with repeated use and cold\u2014think face and hand stiffness after shivering. 2. SCN4A mutations cause a sodium channel gain-of-function; management targets reducing sodium influx with mexiletine. 3.

EMG cold-provocation and long exercise tests increase diagnostic sensitivity\u2014order when standard EMG is inconclusive. 5.
