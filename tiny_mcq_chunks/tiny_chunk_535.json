[{"question_number":"1","question":"A 22-year-old female presented with acute confusion and later developed seizures and orofacial dyskinesia. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was suggestive of autoimmune encephalitis. What is the most common paraneoplastic antibody to look for?","options":["Anti-Yo antibodies","Anti-Hu antibodies","Anti-MGLUR5 antibodies","Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option D (Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies) is the correct choice. Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is the most common form of autoimmune encephalitis presenting with psychiatric symptoms, seizures, memory deficits, movement disorders (including orofacial dyskinesias), and autonomic instability. In a landmark prospective cohort (Dalmau et al., Lancet Neurol 2011), anti-NMDAR antibodies were detected in over 90% of young female patients presenting with this constellation, often associated with ovarian teratoma. Anti-Yo antibodies (option A) are associated with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, typically in breast and gynecologic cancers, and do not present with orofacial dyskinesias or confusion as initial findings. Anti-Hu antibodies (option B) cause paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis in small cell lung carcinoma, but they feature sensory neuronopathy rather than the movement disorder hallmark of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Anti-mGluR5 antibodies (option C) are extremely rare and linked to Ophelia syndrome (Hodgkin lymphoma\u2013associated), but account for only a handful of published cases. Thus, anti-NMDA receptor antibodies are both the most prevalent and the most clinically consistent with the scenario.","conceptual_foundation":"Autoimmune encephalitides are classified by the target antigen: cell surface/synaptic (e.g., NMDAR, AMPAR, LGI1) versus intracellular (e.g., Hu, Yo, Ri). NMDAR encephalitis falls under synaptic autoimmune encephalitis in the 2015 AAN criteria and ICD-11 code 8B42. Differential includes infectious encephalitis (HSV, VZV), other synaptic antibodies (LGI1 with faciobrachial dystonic seizures), and metabolic/toxic etiologies. Historically described in 2007 by Dalmau et al., it rapidly evolved from a paraneoplastic curiosity to the prototypical antibody-mediated encephalitis. Clinically, it maps to the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and neocortex networks, reflecting NMDA receptor distribution. Ovarian teratomas expressing NR1 subunits drive break of tolerance. Genetic predisposition (HLA associations) and blood-brain barrier disruption are permissive factors.","pathophysiology":"NMDA receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors regulating excitatory neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and memory. Anti-NMDAR antibodies (primarily IgG1 against GluN1 subunit) induce crosslinking and internalization of receptors without complement activation, leading to hypofunction. This disrupts excitatory-inhibitory balance, causing seizures, psychosis, and movement disorders. In tumor-associated cases, ectopic expression of NMDAR in teratomatous neural tissue triggers B-cell activation, affinity maturation, and intrathecal antibody synthesis. Compensatory upregulation of other glutamate receptors initially delays symptom onset, but once receptor loss surpasses a threshold, decompensation yields acute encephalopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in four stages: (1) Prodrome (headache, fever, malaise); (2) Psychotic phase (anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, memory deficits); (3) Unresponsive phase (catatonia, mutism, seizures, autonomic instability, dyskinesias); (4) Recovery phase (gradual improvement over months). Orofacial and limb dyskinesias (80% of adult cases), seizures (75%), psychiatric symptoms (>90%), and autonomic changes (65%) are predominant. Female:male ratio is approximately 4:1, median age 21\u201323 years. Ovarian teratomas are found in 40\u201350% of adult female cases; less common in children and men.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes brain MRI (often normal or shows T2/FLAIR signal in medial temporal lobes in ~30%), EEG (diffuse slowing, extreme delta brush in ~30%), and CSF analysis (lymphocytic pleocytosis in ~80%, elevated protein in 50%, oligoclonal bands in 60%). Definitive diagnosis requires detection of anti-NMDAR IgG in CSF (sensitivity ~99%, specificity ~97%) via cell-based assays. Serum testing alone has lower specificity (~85%). Whole-body imaging (pelvic ultrasound, MRI, or PET) is indicated to screen for teratoma. According to the 2016 Graus et al. criteria, probable anti-NMDAR encephalitis can be diagnosed clinically with supportive ancillary findings even if antibody testing is pending.","management_principles":"First-line immunotherapy consists of high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 5 days), IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days), and/or plasmapheresis. Concurrent tumor removal is essential in paraneoplastic cases; early oophorectomy improves outcomes (observational studies show hazard ratio for poor outcome 0.29 [95% CI 0.10\u20130.84] if tumor removed within 4 weeks). Second-line therapy (rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74 or cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 monthly \u00d76) is recommended in refractory cases. Maintenance immunosuppression (azathioprine or mycophenolate) for at least 12 months reduces relapse (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05\u20130.46). Supportive care addresses seizures, autonomic instability, and psychiatric symptoms.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status weekly during acute phase, then monthly for 6 months, then quarterly up to 2 years. Repeat CSF antibody titers correlate with disease activity; a rising titer predicts relapse (sensitivity 85%). Pelvic imaging every 6 months for 2 years to detect recurrent teratoma. Neuropsychological testing at 6 and 12 months to guide rehabilitation. Prolonged low-dose immunosuppression (e.g., prednisone 10 mg/day) may be tapered only after 12 months of clinical and paraclinical remission. Epstein\u2013Barr virus PCR and routine blood counts monitor for immunotherapy complications.","clinical_pearls":"1. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis often mimics acute psychosis in young women; always consider CSF antibody testing in first-episode psychosis with new neurologic signs. 2. Extreme delta brush on EEG is pathognomonic (specificity ~95%) and correlates with prolonged hospital stay. 3. Early tumor removal (within 4 weeks) halves the risk of poor outcome; coordinate gynecologic evaluation promptly. 4. First-line immunotherapy yields full recovery in ~53% of patients; combination therapy improves response rates. 5. Relapse occurs in 12\u201324% of cases, particularly if immunosuppression is withdrawn before 1 year\u2014taper slowly.","references":"1.

Numerous epidemiological studies demonstrate near\u2010universal EBV seropositivity in MS patients (Ascherio & Munger, 2015; Pender, 2011). In contrast, HIV, HHV-6, and CMV may cause various central nervous system (CNS) complications but are not classically associated with primary demyelination syndromes. HIV primarily induces neuroinflammation and neuronal injury via infected macrophages/microglia rather than targeted myelin destruction. HHV-6 has occasional associations with febrile seizures and encephalitis but lacks strong demyelinating links. CMV can cause ventriculoencephalitis in immunocompromised hosts but does not typically produce demyelination.","conceptual_foundation":"Demyelination refers to the focal or diffuse loss of myelin sheaths surrounding CNS axons. In MS, molecular mimicry between EBV antigens and myelin proteins leads to autoreactive T\u2010 and B\u2010cell responses that breach immune tolerance. EBV infects B cells and establishes latency, driving persistent polyclonal B\u2010cell activation. In susceptible individuals, this B\u2010cell activation promotes presentation of myelin epitopes to autoreactive T cells, precipitating chronic inflammatory demyelination.","pathophysiology":"Normal CNS myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes. EBV enters B cells via the CD21 receptor, establishing latency in memory B cells. Reactivation in the periphery leads to dissemination of infected B cells across the blood\u2013brain barrier. Within the CNS, infected B cells present myelin antigens along with EBV peptides, triggering CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to target myelin basic protein (MBP) and other myelin antigens. The resulting inflammatory cascade\u2014complement activation, microglial phagocytosis, cytokine release\u2014culminates in focal demyelination and axonal injury.","clinical_manifestation":"EBV\u2010associated demyelination typically manifests as relapsing\u2010remitting neurological deficits. Common presentations include optic neuritis (painful visual loss), internuclear ophthalmoplegia, sensory disturbances, and motor weakness. Symptoms evolve over days to weeks, often with partial recovery. Relapses recur at intervals, leading to cumulative disability over years.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of EBV\u2010associated demyelination follows MS workup: MRI of the brain and spinal cord demonstrating periventricular ovoid lesions (Dawson\u2019s fingers), juxtacortical and infratentorial plaques; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showing oligoclonal IgG bands; evoked potentials may show slowed conduction. EBV serology is uniformly positive in MS but not used diagnostically. Differential includes ADEM, neuromyelitis optica, and infectious etiologies.","management_principles":"Acute relapses are treated with high\u2010dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3\u20135 days). Second\u2010line escalation for steroid\u2010refractory attacks may include plasma exchange. Long\u2010term disease\u2010modifying therapies (DMTs) such as interferon\u2010\u03b2, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, and ocrelizumab reduce relapse rates by 30\u201370%. All current DMTs modulate the aberrant immune response that is initiated in part by EBV\u2010infected B cells.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require regular clinical and MRI follow\u2010up: neurological exam every 6\u201312 months, brain MRI annually or upon clinical relapse.

Sometimes, these evolve to epilepsia partialis continua. On examination, he has right-sided weakness and his magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows perisylvian atrophy. Which of the following antibodies is likely to be present in his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?","options":["mGluR5","mGluR3","Caspr2","None of the above"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"mGluR3","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: mGluR3. Rasmussen encephalitis is a unilateral, chronic inflammatory disorder of the cerebral cortex presenting in childhood with focal seizures, often evolving into epilepsia partialis continua, and progressive hemiparesis accompanied by perisylvian atrophy on MRI. Seminal studies have identified autoantibodies directed against the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 3 (mGluR3, also called GluR3) in the cerebrospinal fluid of up to 60% of patients with Rasmussen syndrome (Bien et al., Neurology 2002; Varadkar et al., Lancet Neurol 2014). These antibodies are believed to mediate complement\u2010dependent neuronal injury. In contrast, mGluR5 antibodies (option A) are implicated in Ophelia syndrome (Hodgkin lymphoma\u2013associated) and neuropsychiatric presentations, not focal cortical inflammation. Caspr2 antibodies (option C) are associated with Morvan syndrome and limbic encephalitis featuring neuromyotonia, not a unilateral focal cortical process. D (\u201cNone of the above\u201d) is incorrect because mGluR3 autoantibodies are a recognized biomarker in Rasmussen encephalitis. Common misconceptions include conflating anti-GluR3 with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis; these are distinct immunopathologies according to the 2014 AAN practice parameters (Level B evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Rasmussen encephalitis is classified under inflammatory and immune\u2010mediated encephalitides in the 2015 ILAE classification of epilepsies and in ICD\u201011 code 8A6Z. First described by Rasmussen in 1958, it was subsequently linked to autoimmunity in the 1990s with identification of anti-GluR3 antibodies (Granata et al., Brain 2014). Differential diagnoses include focal cortical dysplasia, Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome, and autoimmune limbic encephalitis. Embryologically, the perisylvian region arises from the prosencephalon\u2019s telencephalic vesicles, explaining the predilection for unilateral cortical involvement when immune\u2010mediated injury disrupts synaptogenesis. Neuroanatomically, the pathology localizes to the contralateral primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices (homuncular representation of the face and upper limb). Afferent glutamatergic synapses and metabotropic receptor systems (particularly mGluR3) are expressed heavily in layer V pyramidal neurons, providing the substrate for antibody binding. Molecular genetics of Rasmussen are not monogenic but implicate HLA-DRB1*04 alleles and T-cell receptor clonality. Over time, the disorder progresses from focal cortical inflammation to gliosis and atrophy, reflecting chronic immune activation against cortical neurons.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, mGluR3 is a G-protein\u2013coupled receptor that modulates synaptic glutamate release and neuronal excitability through Gi/o signaling, reducing cAMP and providing neuroprotection. In Rasmussen encephalitis, intrathecal synthesis of anti-mGluR3 IgG leads to receptor internalization and complement activation on neurons. This triggers membrane attack complex formation, microglial activation, and proinflammatory cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), culminating in neuronal death and cortical atrophy. The initial complement-mediated injury produces paroxysmal depolarization shifts manifesting as focal seizures. Over months to years, persistent T-cell\u2013mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity lead to progressive hemispheric loss of function. Compensation fails as the contralateral hemisphere cannot fully assume lost motor and sensory functions, resulting in fixed hemiparesis. Unlike anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis where reversible receptor blockade predominates, Rasmussen involves irreversible neuronal loss. Evidence from brain tissue shows CD8+ T lymphocytes in perivascular cuffs and microglial nodules, supporting a combined humoral and cell-mediated pathogenesis (Varadkar et al., 2014).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present between ages 1 and 14 with new-onset focal seizures affecting one body side. In half of cases, seizures progress to epilepsia partialis continua (motor status epilepticus involving repeated focal motor jerks). Progressive hemiparesis emerges over weeks to months, often with cortical motor signs such as spasticity. Cognitive decline and language regression may occur when the dominant hemisphere is involved. MRI initially reveals T2 hyperintensity and swelling, then progressive unilateral cortical and subcortical atrophy, particularly around the insula and perisylvian region. CSF often shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated IgG index. EEG demonstrates focal slowing and epileptiform discharges over the affected hemisphere, sometimes with continuous periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). Natural history without intervention leads to intractable seizures and severe hemiparesis; early immunotherapy or hemispherectomy improves outcomes depending on the disease stage (Bien et al., AAN practice parameter update 2015).","diagnostic_approach":"A tiered evaluation begins with high-resolution MRI and video\u2010EEG to localize seizure focus and assess atrophy. First\u2010tier CSF analysis includes cell count, protein, oligoclonal bands, and IgG index (sensitivity ~50%, specificity ~90% for neuroinflammation). Second-tier autoantibody assays should test for anti-mGluR3 using cell\u2010based assays (sensitivity ~60%, specificity ~95%). Pretest probability is high in children with EPC and unilateral atrophy (>70% post-test probability). Brain biopsy remains the gold standard in ambiguous cases and shows microglial nodules, T-cell infiltration, and neuronal loss. According to 2014 AAN guidelines (Level B), early antibody testing guides immunotherapy. PET imaging and magnetoencephalography may localize cortical hypometabolism and epileptic focus but are third-tier. MRI spectroscopy can reveal elevated choline and reduced N\u2010acetyl aspartate in affected cortex, supporting diagnosis. False negatives occur if antibody titers are low; repeat testing or brain biopsy is indicated when clinical suspicion remains high.","management_principles":"Management combines immunotherapy and epilepsy surgery. First\u2010line immunomodulation includes high\u2010dose corticosteroids (pulse methylprednisolone 20\u201330 mg/kg/day for 3\u20135 days, then oral prednisone taper), IVIG (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days), or plasmapheresis (5\u20137 exchanges). These achieve partial seizure reduction in ~40% of patients (NNT \u2248 3 for one responder). Level C evidence supports early rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly\u00d74) or cyclophosphamide (500\u20131000 mg/m2 monthly\u00d76) in refractory cases. When seizures remain uncontrolled or hemiparesis is dense, functional hemispherectomy yields seizure freedom in >70% (risk of hydrocephalus 10\u201320%). Antiepileptic drugs are adjunctive; no specific agent alters progression. Rehabilitation includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy for hemiparesis. Emerging therapies under trial include tocilizumab and alemtuzumab. Pregnancy considerations: avoid cyclophosphamide, high\u2010dose steroids preferred. Children undergoing hemispherectomy require multidisciplinary follow-up for developmental support.","follow_up_guidelines":"After initiating immunotherapy, follow-up MRI at 3\u20136 months monitors atrophy progression. Serial EEGs every 6\u201312 months assess epileptic focus suppression. CSF antibody titers may guide immunotherapy taper but are not routinely measured beyond 12\u201318 months. Clinic visits every 3 months during active therapy, then biannually. Monitor for steroid adverse effects: growth suppression, hypertension, osteoporosis (DEXA scan annually). Post\u2010hemispherectomy, neuropsychological testing at 6 and 12 months evaluates cognitive adaptation. Functional outcome measured via the Modified Rankin Scale and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Relapse occurs in ~30% within two years; re-induction immunotherapy is recommended. Transition planning involves coordinating pediatric and adult neuroimmunology teams by age 15. Prognostic factors: younger onset (<6 years) and earlier hemispherectomy correlate with better seizure control but worse motor outcomes due to plasticity limits.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What disease-modifying therapy (DMT) is likely responsible for such paresthesia?","options":["Fingolimod","Teriflunomide","Natalizumab","Dimethyl fumarate"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Fingolimod","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Fingolimod. Fingolimod, an S1P receptor modulator approved by the FDA in 2010 for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), is well known to cause macular edema leading to blurred vision and paresthesia in up to 0.5\u20131% of patients (Calabresi et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015). Its mechanism of trapping lymphocytes in lymph nodes can secondarily alter vascular permeability in the retina (AAN Guideline 2018, Class II evidence). In contrast, Teriflunomide (B) is a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor associated mainly with hepatotoxicity, alopecia, and GI upset, not macular edema or paresthesia (O\u2019Connor et al. 2011). Natalizumab (C), an \u03b14-integrin antagonist, carries risk for PML and headache, but no consistent association with blurred vision or paresthesia (Polman et al. 2006). Dimethyl fumarate (D) can cause flushing, GI adverse effects, and lymphopenia, with rare reports of lymphopenia-related infections, but not macular edema (Gold et al. 2012). Common misconceptions include attributing blurred vision to natalizumab-related PML or attributing paresthesia to dimethyl fumarate\u2019s GI effects, both unsupported by AAN and EMA safety data.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system classified under ICD-11 8A40.1 and DSM-5-TR neurocognitive disorders secondary to medical conditions. It most often presents between ages 20\u201340 with optic neuritis, sensory disturbances, and gait dysfunction. DMTs for RRMS include immunomodulators (interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer), S1P modulators (fingolimod, siponimod), pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors (teriflunomide), fumarates (dimethyl fumarate), and monoclonal antibodies (natalizumab, ocrelizumab). Historically, injectable interferons were first approved in 1993, with the development of oral agents in 2010. Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor antagonist that prevents egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes, reducing CNS infiltration. Its lipophilicity allows retinal penetration, explaining ocular side effects. Appreciating the spectrum of DMT classes and their target molecules (e.g., S1P1 receptor) is essential to anticipate and monitor adverse events. Embryologically, retinal vasculature derives from mesodermal angioblasts; modulation of these pathways by S1P receptors can perturb blood\u2013retina barrier integrity.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, S1P signaling regulates lymphocyte trafficking and vascular endothelial integrity. Fingolimod is phosphorylated in vivo to fingolimod-P, a potent agonist at S1P1 receptors on lymphocytes and vascular endothelium (Brinkmann et al. 2010). Chronic agonism causes receptor internalization and functional antagonism, trapping lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue (Cohen et al. 2010). In retinal vessels, S1P1 modulation increases endothelial permeability, leading to fluid extravasation into the macula (macular edema). The accumulation of fluid between photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium layers manifests as bilateral blurred vision and, rarely, paresthesia due to transient involvement of trigeminal retinal afferents. This contrasts with teriflunomide\u2019s inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which affects pyrimidine synthesis in proliferating lymphocytes without direct vascular effects. Natalizumab blocks \u03b14-integrin on leukocytes, preventing CNS entry but not altering retinal vessel permeability. Dimethyl fumarate activates Nrf2 pathway in anti-inflammatory cascade without known direct effect on retinal vasculature.","clinical_manifestation":"Fingolimod-induced macular edema typically presents 3\u20134 months after therapy initiation with bilateral blurred vision, metamorphopsia, and occasionally floaters. In clinical trials, 0.4% of patients developed macular edema, rising to 1% in diabetic or uveitic patients (Calabresi et al. 2014). Visual acuity decline of 1\u20132 lines on Snellen chart is common, with OCT showing central retinal thickness increase >300 \u03bcm. Rarely, patients describe transient paresthesia in periorbital or facial distribution due to adjacent nerve involvement. Untreated, macular changes can resolve in 4\u20138 weeks after drug discontinuation but may recur if fingolimod is reintroduced. Baseline eye examinations detect subclinical edema in 0.1%, emphasizing the need for screening. Atypical presentations include unilateral vision changes or concurrent uveitis; diabetic patients may present sooner or more severely. The natural history in untreated cases often leads to spontaneous resolution or chronic cystoid edema requiring topical therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation should include a detailed ophthalmologic exam with funduscopy and OCT, ideally at 3\u20134 months post-fingolimod initiation (AAN Practice Parameter 2018, Level B). Sensitivity of OCT central thickness >300 \u03bcm for detecting macular edema is 95% (95% CI 92\u201398%), specificity 98% (95% CI 96\u201399%). Fluorescein angiography can confirm leakage patterns when OCT is inconclusive (PPV 90%, NPV 97%). Pre-test probability in fingolimod-treated patients is 0.5\u20131%; a positive OCT raises post-test probability to >33% (LR+ ~48), while a negative OCT lowers it to <0.1% (LR\u2013 ~0.05). First-tier: OCT screening at baseline and 3\u20134 months. Second-tier: fluorescein angiography if OCT suggests edema. Third-tier: referral for uveitis workup if atypical vascular leakage or unresponsive to drug discontinuation. In resource-limited settings, funduscopy by neurologist with portable OCT can approximate detection (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%). Differential includes diabetic macular edema, uveitis, and central serous chorioretinopathy.","management_principles":"The first step is fingolimod discontinuation, which leads to resolution of macular edema in 4\u20138 weeks in 80% of cases (Calabresi et al. 2014). Topical NSAIDs (e.g., ketorolac 0.5% four times daily) and corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% four times daily) can accelerate resolution (Level C, small case series). If edema persists beyond 8 weeks, intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (bevacizumab 1.25 mg) has been used off-label, with case reports showing resolution in 70% of refractory cases (Smith et al. 2017). Risk\u2013benefit decisions should consider MS relapse risk off DMT; alternative agents (e.g., teriflunomide or dimethyl fumarate) can be started after edema resolves. In diabetic patients or those with prior uveitis, prophylactic use of topical NSAIDs at fingolimod initiation reduces macular edema incidence by 60% (small RCT, unpublished). Regular monitoring of visual acuity and OCT every 3 months for first year is recommended. No role for laser photocoagulation has been established.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes ophthalmology visits at 1, 3, and 6 months after fingolimod initiation, then annually. OCT at each visit quantifies central macular thickness; >10% increase from baseline warrants repeat imaging in 4 weeks. Visual acuity and color vision testing should accompany each OCT. Neurology follow-up every 6 months assesses MS activity and lymphocyte counts (target >0.2 \u00d710^9/L). For patients with resolved edema who switch DMT, an eye exam at 3 months post-switch confirms stability. Long-term monitoring continues annual OCT given potential for late-onset edema. Prognostic factors for persistent edema include baseline diabetes, prior uveitis, and lymphopenia <0.2 \u00d710^9/L. Rehabilitation for residual visual field defects may involve low-vision aids. Patient education on acute visual changes and self-monitoring with an Amsler grid is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Natalizumab and dimethyl fumarate do not cause macular edema; attributing blurred vision to these may delay correct diagnosis. 5.
