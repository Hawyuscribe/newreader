What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Chorea","Tics","Akathisia"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Akathisia","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C. Akathisia. Akathisia is characterized by inner restlessness and a compulsion to move, often manifesting as pacing, shifting weight, or inability to sit still. It is a common extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotic therapy, with incidence up to 20\u201330% depending on the agent (Leucht et al. 2013). Antipsychotic\u2010induced akathisia typically appears days to weeks after initiation or dose escalation of dopamine D2 antagonists.\n\nOption A (Chorea) features irregular, flowing, dance-like movements without subjective restlessness; it is not associated with an inability to sit but rather intermittent involuntary movements. Option B (Tics) are stereotyped, brief, suppressible movements or vocalizations, often present since childhood, and not described as continuous restlessness. Neither chorea nor tics produce the subjective inner tension characteristic of akathisia. ","conceptual_foundation":"Akathisia falls under drug-induced movement disorders in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11 8A04.2). It is distinct from parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, tics, chorea, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Dopamine blockade (particularly D2 receptor antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway) disrupts basal ganglia motor circuits, leading to akathisia. Differential diagnoses include restless legs syndrome (urge to move legs at rest with nighttime predominance) and anxiety disorders.","pathophysiology":"Dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the ventral striatum and nucleus accumbens leads to an imbalance between dopaminergic and noradrenergic activity. This results in increased activity of the indirect basal ganglia pathway and hyperactivity of adrenergic and serotonergic systems, producing subjective restlessness and motor agitation. Elevated noradrenergic tone in the locus coeruleus contributes to the inner restlessness sensation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients describe an intense urge to move, usually within days to weeks of antipsychotic initiation or dose increase. Objective signs include pacing, shifting weight, foot tapping, and inability to remain seated. Severity is rated by the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS). There may be associated anxiety and agitation. Untreated, akathisia can worsen, lead to poor medication adherence, and increase suicidal ideation.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on history of antipsychotic exposure, subjective restlessness, and objective signs of motion. BARS provides a structured assessment. No laboratory or imaging tests are required. Key is to differentiate from worsening psychosis, agitation, or other movement disorders.","management_principles":"First-line treatment includes dose reduction of the offending antipsychotic if clinically feasible. Beta-blockers (propranolol 30\u2013120 mg/day) have the strongest evidence (Grade A, Leucht et al. 2013). Second-line: mirtazapine or benzodiazepines. Anticholinergics are generally ineffective for akathisia. Switching to an antipsychotic with lower akathisia risk (e.g., quetiapine, clozapine) may be considered.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor BARS score weekly until resolution. Follow\u2010up visits should assess akathisia severity, adherence, and suicidal ideation. If unresolved after 4\u20136 weeks, consider referral to movement disorders specialist for alternative therapies (e.g., amantadine, clonidine).","clinical_pearls":["Akathisia can mimic agitation in psychosis\u2014always ask about subjective restlessness when evaluating agitation on antipsychotics.","Beta-blockers are the treatment of choice\u2014aim for equivalent of propranolol 60\u201380 mg/day.","Lower potency antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have reduced akathisia risk and can be used if dose reduction fails.","Use the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) to objectively track severity and treatment response.","Severe akathisia is linked to increased suicide risk\u2014monitor mood and suicidal thoughts closely."],"references":["1.

Normal alleles contain \u226426 repeats, intermediate 27\u201335, reduced penetrance 36\u201339, and full penetrance \u226540. Expanded repeats undergo anticipation across generations, leading to earlier onset in offspring.","pathophysiology":"Expanded CAG repeats in HTT produce mutant huntingtin with elongated polyglutamine tracts, causing misfolding, aggregation, and neuronal toxicity via transcriptional dysregulation, impaired axonal transport, and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Gabapentin has some benefit but with less consistent responses. Levodopa and primidone are not standard therapies for this condition.","conceptual_foundation":"Orthostatic tremor is characterized by a 13\u201318 Hz tremor of leg muscles upon standing, mediated by central oscillators. GABAergic modulation reduces the central oscillator drive, improving tremor amplitude and patient comfort.","pathophysiology":"High-frequency tremor arises from synchronized oscillatory discharges in spinal and brainstem circuits.

Increase levodopa and add amantadine. The patient exhibits wearing-off parkinsonism and peak-dose dyskinesias on levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg q6h.

Option A (decrease levodopa and increase dopamine agonist) would worsen parkinsonism and may not alleviate dyskinesias; dopamine agonists themselves can exacerbate dyskinesias and carry impulse control risks.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease arises from degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons (ICD-11: 8A04.0). Motor complications include wearing-off and peak-dose dyskinesias. Levodopa remains the most effective therapy; amantadine\u2019s anti-dyskinetic properties were identified in the 1970s. Movement disorder specialists classify and tailor therapies based on motor diaries and validated scales like the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale.","pathophysiology":"Wearing-off occurs due to levodopa\u2019s short half-life (~90 minutes) and reduced striatal dopamine storage capacity, leading to fluctuating synaptic dopamine. Peak-dose dyskinesias stem from pulsatile dopamine receptor stimulation sensitizing D1 pathways and glutamatergic overactivity in the internal pallidum. Amantadine blocks NMDA receptors, attenuating excessive glutamate signaling and normalizing basal ganglia output.","clinical_manifestation":"Wearing-off typically emerges 5\u20137 years into levodopa therapy, presenting as predictable return of rigidity and bradykinesia before the next dose. Peak-dose dyskinesias manifest as choreiform or dystonic movements at levodopa plasma peaks, affecting 50\u201380% of patients after long-term therapy. Both phenomena adversely impact quality of life.","diagnostic_approach":"Use motor diaries to chart 'On' and 'Off' periods and dyskinesia timing. UPDRS Part IV quantifies motor complications. Wear-off is diagnosed when symptoms recur before scheduled dosing; dyskinesias when involuntary movements coincide with peak dose. No imaging or laboratory biomarkers are used in routine practice.","management_principles":"To manage wearing-off, increase levodopa dose frequency (e.g., q4 h), employ sustained-release formulations, or add COMT inhibitors (entacapone) or MAO-B inhibitors (rasagiline). For peak-dose dyskinesias, initiate amantadine at 100 mg at bedtime, titrating to 100 mg TID as tolerated.
