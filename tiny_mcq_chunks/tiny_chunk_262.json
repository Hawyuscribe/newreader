[{"question_number":"3","question":"A patient on pramipexol for Parkinson's Disease (PD) develops hallucinations. What is the recommended action?","options":["Stop pramipexol"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Stop pramipexol","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Stop pramipexol. In Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) patients who develop visual hallucinations on dopamine agonists, the recommended action is dose reduction or discontinuation of the offending agent (AAN Guideline 2018, Class I evidence). Dopamine agonist\u2013induced psychosis occurs in up to 17% of patients (Weintraub et al., 2006). Option A directly addresses the causative medication. Common misconceptions include adding antipsychotics without first adjusting dopaminergic therapy; however, reducing or stopping the dopamine agonist often resolves hallucinations in 60\u201370% of cases within 2\u20134 weeks (AAN, 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Pramipexole is a nonergot dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist used in early and advanced PD (ICD-11 8A00). PD psychosis falls under ICD-11 code 6A24. Hallucinations represent drug-induced psychosis, distinct from Lewy body dementia psychosis. Dopamine agonist psychosis reflects overstimulation of mesolimbic D3 receptors. Historical classifications of PD psychosis have evolved from purely dopaminergic toxicity to include cholinergic deficiency hypotheses.","pathophysiology":"Normal dopaminergic transmission in nigrostriatal pathways modulates motor control, while mesolimbic dopamine mediates perception and reward. Pramipexole\u2019s high affinity for D3 receptors in the ventral striatum and limbic system leads to overstimulation, causing visual misperceptions and hallucinations. Chronic agonist therapy also downregulates postsynaptic dopamine receptors, altering cortical\u2013subcortical loops. Anticholinergic balance is disrupted, as cholinergic interneurons in the striatum modulate visual processing; decreased cholinergic tone exacerbates hallucinations.","clinical_manifestation":"Dopamine agonist\u2013induced hallucinations are typically visual, well-formed, and nonthreatening (animals, people), often occurring in dim lighting. Onset is subacute, within weeks to months of dose escalation. Insight is usually preserved. Risk factors include advanced age, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy. Without intervention, hallucinations can progress to delusions and behavioral disturbances, increasing caregiver burden and fall risk.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnose by temporal correlation between agonist initiation/dose increase and onset of hallucinations. First-tier evaluation includes thorough history to exclude delirium, infection, metabolic causes. MMSE or MoCA assess cognitive status. Brain imaging if atypical features to rule out Lewy body dementia. EEG is generally low-yield. Rule out other medications (anticholinergics, amantadine) that can contribute to psychosis.","management_principles":"Per AAN 2018 guidelines, reduce or discontinue dopamine agonist (Level A). If psychosis persists, reduce levodopa regimen. Antipsychotic therapy (quetiapine or clozapine) is second-line (Level B); quetiapine starting 12.5 mg at bedtime, titrate to 25\u201350 mg, monitoring for sedation. Pimavanserin is FDA-approved for PD psychosis but used after dopamine reduction. Rivastigmine may be considered if cognitive decline present.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess within 2\u20134 weeks of dopamine agonist discontinuation. Monitor for motor symptom worsening; adjust levodopa accordingly. Follow-up every 1\u20132 months for psychosis resolution and motor stability. Use Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) to track changes. Long-term, evaluate for development of dementia or Lewy body disease.","clinical_pearls":"1. Visual hallucinations in PD often reflect treatment effect, not primary psychiatric illness. 2. Always adjust dopaminergic therapy before adding antipsychotics. 3. Quetiapine is preferred off-label antipsychotic due to minimal motor side effects. 4. Pimavanserin is a serotonin inverse agonist approved for PD psychosis. 5. Insight is preserved in drug-induced hallucinations, distinguishing from psychotic disorders.","references":"11. Trenkwalder C, et al. Mov Disord. 2018;33(2):281\u2013289. doi:10.1002/mds.27127\n12.

Parkinson\u2019s disease (A) typically manifests with asymmetric rest tremor, bradykinesia, and a robust response to levodopa. Multiple sclerosis (B) presents with relapsing demyelinating features and does not cause vertical gaze palsy. Essential tremor (D) is characterized by bilateral action tremor without gaze palsy or axial rigidity.","conceptual_foundation":"PSP is a 4-repeat tauopathy classified under ICD-11 code 8D53 among atypical parkinsonian syndromes. First described by Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski in 1964, PSP\u2019s NINDS-SPSP 1996 and MDS 2017 diagnostic criteria emphasize vertical gaze palsy and early falls. Differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple system atrophy, and corticobasal syndrome. Embryologically, tau protein is involved in microtubule assembly; pathological hyperphosphorylation leads to neuronal dysfunction in midbrain and basal ganglia.","pathophysiology":"Normal vertical gaze is mediated by the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the midbrain. In PSP, tau aggregation causes neuronal loss in the midbrain tectum, subthalamic nucleus, and globus pallidus, disrupting supranuclear gaze pathways. Dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta contributes to rigidity and bradykinesia. Unlike Parkinson\u2019s disease, PSP shows limited response to levodopa due to widespread postsynaptic pathology.","clinical_manifestation":"PSP presents in the seventh decade with early unexplained falls, vertical gaze limitation (down > up), axial rigidity, pseudobulbar palsy, and frontal cognitive disturbances. Prevalence is ~5\u20136 per 100 000. MRI may demonstrate \u2018hummingbird\u2019 sign\u2014midbrain atrophy with preserved pons. Progressive decline leads to dysphagia and axial disability within 5\u20137 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Use MDS PSP criteria: mandatory presence of akinetic-rigid syndrome, supranuclear gaze palsy or slow vertical saccades, and supportive MRI findings. First-tier imaging: MRI brain (midbrain atrophy ratio sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%). Exclude metabolic and structural mimics. Second-tier: PET shows reduced midbrain metabolism. Third-tier: tau PET tracers are investigational.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists. Symptomatic management includes trial of levodopa (initial 300 mg/day) although <30% show mild transient benefit. Amantadine and physical therapy may improve gait and reduce falls. Speech therapy addresses dysphagia. Experimental tau-targeted therapies are under clinical trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess gait and fall risk every 3 months. Monitor swallowing annually with video fluoroscopy. Neuropsychological testing yearly to track frontal dysfunction. Adjust supportive therapies as disability progresses.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early falls and vertical gaze palsy strongly suggest PSP. 2. Hummingbird sign on MRI is a useful radiologic marker. 3. Poor levodopa response differentiates PSP from PD. 4. Frontal cognitive impairment often precedes motor disability. 5. Tau PET imaging remains investigational but promising in PSP diagnosis.","references":"1. H\u00f6glinger GU, et al.

Temporal lobe lesions (B) produce memory and language deficits; parietal lobe (C) produce sensory neglect; occipital lobe (D) produce visual field cuts.","conceptual_foundation":"The frontal lobes integrate planning, motivation, and goal\u2010directed behavior. The medial frontal system connects limbic structures (ventral striatum, thalamus) to modulate affect and motivation. Disruption leads to reduced initiative and flattened affect, clinically manifesting as apathy.","pathophysiology":"Normal function relies on dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area to the medial prefrontal cortex. Traumatic shearing forces disrupt white matter tracts (cingulum bundle), impairing dopaminergic signaling and producing apathy. Secondary inflammation may exacerbate neuronal dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"Post-TBI apathy occurs in up to 40% of patients with frontal damage. It is characterized by diminished motivation, reduced spontaneous speech, and decreased emotional responsiveness, distinct from depression by lack of dysphoria.","diagnostic_approach":"Assess with the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Neuroimaging (MRI) shows lesions in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Neuropsychological testing differentiates from depression.","management_principles":"Treat with dopaminergic agents (e.g., methylphenidate) or amantadine to enhance frontal dopamine. Behavioral activation therapy may improve initiation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor motivation and function monthly. Repeat imaging only if new deficits arise.
