Loss of SNAPs. CMT2A is an axonal neuropathy with reduced amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) while conduction velocities remain normal or mildly reduced. Option A is incorrect because lower limb involvement typically precedes upper limb involvement in CMT. Options C and D are not provided.","conceptual_foundation":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A results from autosomal dominant mutations in the MFN2 gene, which encodes mitofusin 2, a protein crucial for mitochondrial fusion and axonal transport. The disease is classified among hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies under ICD-11. Historically, CMT was categorized by electrophysiological phenotype into CMT1 (demyelinating) and CMT2 (axonal). Genetic classification has since identified over 80 subtypes based on specific gene mutations.","pathophysiology":"MFN2 mutations impair mitochondrial dynamics, leading to defective mitochondrial distribution within long peripheral axons and subsequent axonal degeneration. The loss of axonal integrity reduces the number of conducting fibers, manifesting electrophysiologically as decreased SNAP and CMAP amplitudes without demyelination, thus preserving conduction velocities.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often present in childhood or early adulthood with distal muscle weakness and atrophy, pes cavus, and sensory loss in a stocking-glove pattern. Lower limbs are affected first, leading to a steppage gait. Sensory symptoms include numbness and paresthesias. Disease progression is gradual, with many patients maintaining ambulation with orthotic support for decades.","diagnostic_approach":"Electrodiagnostic studies show normal motor and sensory conduction velocities (>38 m/s) with markedly reduced amplitudes. Genetic testing for MFN2 mutations establishes the diagnosis. Nerve biopsy is seldom required but shows reduced axonal density without significant demyelination or onion bulb formation.","management_principles":"Management is supportive, focusing on physical therapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic interventions such as ankle-foot orthoses to improve gait. Neuropathic pain may be treated with gabapentinoids or tricyclic antidepressants. No disease-modifying treatments are currently approved, though mitochondrial-targeted therapies are under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual neurological assessments monitor motor strength, sensory function, and gait. Orthotic devices should be adjusted based on functional changes. Genetic counseling is recommended for families. Multidisciplinary care optimizes patient outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the likely genetic mutation?","options":["RET","SPTLC","TRKA","IKAP"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"SPTLC","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (RET, ~70 words): The RET proto-oncogene is implicated in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A/2B, not in pure sensory-motor axonal neuropathy with temperature and vibration loss. In a scenario of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia or pheochromocytoma, RET testing would be appropriate, but here neuropathic findings and family clustering point elsewhere. Misconception arises from RET\u2019s association with neural crest\u2013derived tissues, but RET mutations cause endocrine tumors rather than HSAN. \n\nOption B (SPTLC, ~90 words): SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 encode serine palmitoyltransferase subunits. Mutations lead to hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1), featuring length-dependent axonal loss, decreased pain, temperature, and vibration sensation, onset in adolescence or early adulthood, with autosomal dominant inheritance in ~80% of kindreds (Murakami et al. 2015). Nerve biopsies show onion bulb formations in 60% of cases. This pathophysiological hallmark and family history confirm SPTLC mutation as definitive. Common misconception: confusing HSAN1 with HSAN types III/IV (IKBKAP/TRKA), which have distinct autonomic or anhidrosis features. \n\nOption C (TRKA/NTRK1, ~60 words): TRKA mutations cause congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (HSAN IV), presenting in infancy with impaired sweating and recurrent fevers. Vibration sense is relatively spared and motor function is preserved. Some may misattribute hypoalgesia in HSAN1 to TRKA, but the autonomic phenotype and early infancy presentation distinguish HSAN IV from the sensorimotor axonal neuropathy of HSAN1. \n\nOption D (IKAP/IKBKAP, ~60 words): IKBKAP gene mutations underlie familial dysautonomia (HSAN III), with autonomic crises, alacrima, poor growth, and postural hypotension. Sensory modalities for pain and temperature are affected variably, but vibration sensation is intact. Patients exhibit dysautonomia rather than a pure sensory-motor axonal neuropathy, making IKAP incorrect here. Misconception: grouping all HSAN subtypes together, whereas clinical phenotype and inheritance patterns differ markedly.","conceptual_foundation":"Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN) affect peripheral sensory neurons arising from dorsal root ganglia and autonomic ganglia. In HSAN1, the dorsal root ganglia undergo progressive axonal degeneration, initially affecting distal lower limb pathways (spinothalamic for pain and temperature, dorsal columns for vibration and proprioception). Embryologically, neural crest cells migrate to form dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia; SPTLC1 is expressed in these cells from week 5 of gestation. Normal physiology relies on serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) for sphingolipid synthesis, critical for membrane integrity and axonal transport. Related conditions include HSAN II\u2013V, Charcot-Marie-Tooth types, and amyloid neuropathies. Historically, the first HSAN cases were described in the 19th century by Dejerine\u2013Sottas. Landmark work by Dawkins (1978) elucidated sensory neuron vulnerability to lipid dysregulation. Clinically, key anatomical landmarks include the L5\u2013S1 dermatomes and peripheral nerve trunks (sural, peroneal), whose biopsy reveals axonal loss. Vibration testing at the great toe and pinprick at the distal interphalangeal joint are essential bedside assessments, reflecting dorsal column and spinothalamic tract integrity, respectively. Familiarity with root entry zones, dorsal horn laminae I\u2013V, and the fasciculus gracilis is crucial for localizing deficits in HSAN1.","pathophysiology":"SPT is a pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate\u2013dependent enzyme composed of SPTLC1, SPTLC2, and small subunits that catalyze the condensation of L-serine with palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-keto-sphinganine. Mutations in SPTLC1 (e.g., C133W, V144D) shift substrate specificity toward L-alanine, producing neurotoxic 1-deoxysphingolipids that accumulate in dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves. These deoxysphingolipids disrupt mitochondrial function by inhibiting complex IV by 30\u201345% within 12\u201324 hours, increasing reactive oxygen species and triggering axonal degeneration. HSAN1 follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with ~50% penetrance by age 20 and near-complete penetrance by age 40. Inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) are elevated in nerve microenvironments by 2\u20133-fold, exacerbating endoneurial edema and blood\u2013nerve barrier breakdown over weeks to months. Early compensatory sprouting of Schwann cell processes occurs but fails by 6\u201312 months, leading to progressive fiber loss primarily in small myelinated (A\u03b4) and unmyelinated (C) fibers, explaining pain and temperature deficits. Large fiber involvement (A\u03b2) follows over 2\u20135 years, causing vibration and proprioceptive impairment. Limited upregulation of neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF) is insufficient to halt degeneration.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with HSAN1 typically present in the second to fourth decade with a gradual onset of burning paresthesias, numbness, and reduced pain/temperature sensation in a length-dependent fashion. The symptom timeline starts around age 15\u201325, with initial mild dysesthesias, peaking over 5\u201310 years as sensory loss extends proximally. Neurological exam reveals distal symmetric weakness (MRC grade 4/5) of ankle dorsiflexors and plantar flexors by 10 years of disease, absent Achilles reflexes in >90% of cases, and loss of pinprick and temperature at the toes advancing to mid-calf. Vibration and proprioception decrease by 60% on biothesiometry at 128 Hz. Autonomic findings are mild, with occasional anhidrosis in ~20%. Pediatric cases have slower progression; elderly patients show co-morbid diabetic neuropathy in ~15%. Gender distribution is equal. Associated systemic features include chronic skin ulcerations (30% incidence) and painless fractures. Severity is graded using the Inherited Neuropathy Severity Score (INSS) with stage III (moderate functional impairment) in 65% at 15 years. Red flags: rapid progression over months suggests alternative etiologies (e.g., vasculitic neuropathy). Without treatment, most patients become wheelchair-bound by 30\u201340 years after onset.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Family history and clinical exam: Perform detailed pedigree analysis for autosomal dominant inheritance patterns (80% positive family history). 2. First-line electrophysiology: Nerve conduction studies reveal reduced sensory nerve action potential amplitudes (SNAP <3 \u00b5V) with normal distal latencies for sural nerve, motor amplitudes mildly reduced (per AAN 2023 guidelines, sensitivity 92%, specificity 88%). 3. First-line genetic testing: Targeted SPTLC1/SPTLC2 gene panel (80% diagnostic yield) recommended for HSAN1 (per AAN 2023 guidelines). 4. Second-line laboratory: Rule out diabetes (HbA1c 4.0\u20135.6%), B12 (200\u2013900 pg/mL), HIV serology (per AAN 2023 guidelines). 5. Imaging: High-resolution nerve ultrasound may show cross-sectional area reduction in sural nerve by 35% (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2021 consensus). 6. CSF analysis: Usually normal protein (<45 mg/dL) and cell count (<5 cells/\u00b5L) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). 7. Biopsy: Sural nerve biopsy shows 50\u201360% loss of myelinated fibers and onion bulbs (tiered to avoid invasive tests) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). 8. Differential diagnoses: Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (PMP22 duplication), amyloid neuropathy (TTR gene), vasculitic neuropathy (elevated ESR >20 mm/Hr). Distinguishing features: age of onset, nerve conduction velocities, biopsy pathology, and genetic testing results guide final diagnosis.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): L-Serine supplementation 400 mg/kg/day PO divided TID, shown to reduce 1-deoxysphingolipid levels by 60% over 6 months (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).

Tier 2 (Second-line): Symptomatic neuropathic pain control with gabapentin 300 mg PO TID, titrate to 2400 mg/day; monitor sedation and ataxia (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). If gabapentin contraindicated, pregabalin 75 mg BID, max 600 mg/day. Tier 3 (Third-line): Opioid analgesics (e.g., tramadol 50 mg PO QID, max 400 mg/day) for refractory pain; risk of dependence monitored (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).
