Nicardipine. After intravenous tPA administration for acute ischemic stroke, current AHA/ASA guidelines recommend maintaining systolic blood pressure below 180 mm Hg and diastolic below 105 mm Hg for at least 24 hours post-thrombolysis (Jauch et al. 2013). Nicardipine is a potent intravenous dihydropyridine calcium\u2010channel blocker with rapid onset and a titratable infusion, allowing precise blood pressure control. In randomized studies, nicardipine achieved target SBP reduction within a median of 15 minutes with fewer episodes of overshoot compared with labetalol (Saver et al. 2007). Option A, amlodipine, is an oral agent with slow onset and prolonged duration, unsuitable for acute tight BP control. Option C, observation, is inappropriate because persistent hypertension above guideline thresholds increases risk of hemorrhagic transformation by up to threefold (Hacke et al. 2008). Option D, diazepam, may reduce anxiety but does not lower blood pressure reliably and carries risk of respiratory depression and sedation, complicating neurologic monitoring.","conceptual_foundation":"Key principles in acute ischemic stroke management include balancing perfusion and hemorrhagic risk. Before reperfusion, permissive hypertension up to SBP 220 mm Hg may support collateral flow. After tPA, strict BP control (SBP <180/DBP <105 mm Hg) is mandated to minimize blood\u2013brain barrier disruption and reduce hemorrhagic transformation. Intravenous agents (nicardipine, labetalol, clevidipine) are preferred for their rapid, titratable effects; oral antihypertensives lack real-time adjustability and may overshoot, risking hypotension. This scenario aligns with ICD-11 code 8B01 (acute ischemic stroke) and is governed by AHA/ASA stroke care pathways.","pathophysiology":"Acute arterial occlusion causes ischemia and potential penumbra salvage. tPA induces fibrinolysis but also transiently increases blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Elevated systemic BP post-tPA exacerbates capillary hydrostatic pressure, promoting hemorrhagic conversion. Nicardipine inhibits L-type calcium channels on vascular smooth muscle, reducing arterial tone and systemic pressure without significantly altering cerebral autoregulation. This preserves cerebral perfusion pressure while lowering intracapillary stress, mitigating hemorrhage risk (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2019).","clinical_manifestation":"Post-tPA, patients should undergo frequent neurologic exams and BP checks. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurs in approximately 6\u201310% of tPA\u2010treated patients, with uncontrolled hypertension as a major predictor. Anxiety and restlessness are common but secondary to stroke stress; they should not delay antihypertensive treatment. Nicardipine\u2019s common side effects\u2014reflex tachycardia and headache\u2014are generally transient and manageable with dose adjustment.","diagnostic_approach":"Continuous noninvasive BP monitoring (or arterial line if available) is recommended. First-tier: BP readings every 15 minutes for first 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then hourly until 24 hours. Head CT at 24 hours (or immediately upon neurologic deterioration) is indicated before starting antiplatelet therapy. Pre-test probability of hemorrhagic transformation significantly increases with SBP >180 mm Hg; tight control reduces number needed to treat (NNT\u224815) to prevent one hemorrhagic event.","management_principles":"First-line: nicardipine infusion starting at 5 mg/h, increasing by 2.5 mg/h every 5 minutes to target SBP 140\u2013180 mm Hg (Class I, Level A; AHA/ASA 2018). Alternative: labetalol 10\u201320 mg IV bolus. Oral agents are not recommended acutely. Diazepam addresses only anxiety, not hypertension, and carries sedation risk. Maintain target BP for 24 hours post-tPA, then transition to oral antihypertensives per chronic stroke prevention guidelines.","follow_up_guidelines":"Continue intensive BP monitoring as above. Repeat noncontrast head CT at 24 hours or immediately upon neurologic change. Educate patient on home BP monitoring and adherence. After 24 hours, introduce antiplatelet therapy if no hemorrhage.

What will you do next?","options":["LP","Blood patch","MRV"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"MRV","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C (MRV). In a postpartum patient presenting one day after cesarean delivery with a headache that worsens on sitting and with Valsalva maneuvers, normal brain MRI and normal neurological examination, cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a leading concern. Noncontrast MRI can miss dural sinus thrombosis in up to 30% of cases; therefore, MR venography (MRV) is required to visualize venous flow voids and identify filling defects in the dural sinuses (Einh\u00e4upl et al. 2010). Option A (LP) could worsen an existing thrombosis by lowering CSF pressure further and is contraindicated without first excluding elevated intracranial pressure. Option B (blood patch) treats post\u2013dural puncture headache (PDPH) following neuraxial anesthesia; however, PDPH improves when supine and is pressure\u2010dependent, whereas CVT headaches worsen with maneuvers that increase intracranial venous pressure. Thus, MRV is the evidence\u2010based next step (AHA/ASA 2011 Guidelines, Class I, Level B).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding CVT in the postpartum period begins with the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy. The Virchow triad\u2014venous stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability\u2014is accentuated in late pregnancy and the puerperium (ICD-11: 8B42). Related conditions include sagittal sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, and cortical vein thrombosis; differential diagnoses include PDPH, preeclampsia, bacterial meningitis, and intracranial hemorrhage. Historically, sinus thrombosis was diagnosed at autopsy until the advent of pneumoencephalography and later CT venography in the 1980s; MRV was introduced in the 1990s. The postpartum hypercoagulability is mediated by increases in fibrinogen, factors VII, VIII, X, and von Willebrand factor, along with decreased protein S levels. Neuroanatomically, the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses drain cortical veins, converge at the confluence of sinuses, and empty into the internal jugular veins; disruption leads to impaired CSF absorption and increased intracranial pressure. Genetic thrombophilias (Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A) further raise risk.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral venous circulation maintains intracranial pressure and CSF absorption via arachnoid granulations. In CVT, thrombus formation in dural sinuses obstructs outflow, elevating venous and capillary hydrostatic pressure, causing vasogenic edema, reduced CSF absorption, and intracranial hypertension. Endothelial injury triggers local inflammation with release of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), increasing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Elevated venous pressure can lead to venous infarction with hemorrhagic transformation. In contrast, PDPH is due to CSF leakage from a dural puncture, causing low CSF volume and sagging of intracranial contents, relieved when supine. LP in CVT risks downward herniation if intracranial pressure is elevated. CVT pathophysiology is an acute prothrombotic cascade, whereas PDPH is mechanical CSF hypovolemia.","clinical_manifestation":"CVT often presents subacutely over days to weeks. Headache is the most common feature (>90%), often progressive, diffuse, and worsened by Valsalva or upright posture. Focal neurologic deficits (30\u201340%), seizures (30\u201350%), and papilledema (40\u201360%) may develop. In the postpartum period, CVT risk peaks within the first 4 weeks. PDPH typically begins 24\u201348 hours after dural puncture, is postural (worse upright, relieved supine), and associated with neck stiffness, tinnitus, and photophobia. In CVT, headaches are not relieved by supine positioning and can be associated with vomiting and altered consciousness. Natural history of untreated CVT carries a mortality up to 10\u201315% and risk of chronic sequelae such as persistent headache and epilepsy.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Noncontrast head MRI combined with MRV is the gold standard (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%) for CVT (Einh\u00e4upl et al. 2010). Pretest probability in postpartum women with atypical headache is ~10\u201315%. MRV shows absence of flow in thrombosed sinuses. CT venography is an alternative (sens 85\u201390%, spec 85\u201388%) if MRI unavailable. Second-tier: Digital subtraction angiography reserved for equivocal cases. D-dimer has limited negative predictive value in isolated headache presentations. Routine LP is not indicated. Testing for thrombophilias (protein C/S, antithrombin, antiphospholipid antibodies) should be performed but does not guide acute imaging. In resource-limited settings, CT head and CT venogram may suffice. Imaging contraindications: MRI incompatible implants.","management_principles":"Immediate anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended even with hemorrhagic infarcts (Class I, Level B). Initial dosing: enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours. Transition to warfarin (target INR 2.0\u20133.0) for 3\u20136 months for provoked CVT. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are emerging options (RESPECT-CVT trial, 2020). Management of intracranial hypertension includes head elevation, analgesia, and acetazolamide for papilledema. Seizures require antiepileptic therapy. Decompressive hemicraniectomy considered in malignant CVT with mass effect (Class IIb, Level C). In pregnancy, LMWH is preferred; warfarin contraindicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months with neurological exam, headache assessment, and funduscopic exam. MRI/MRV at 3\u20136 months to assess recanalization; recanalization rates approach 85% by 6 months. Monitor INR monthly until stable, then every 2\u20133 months. Long-term follow-up for residual headaches, seizures, and cognitive deficits. Thrombophilia results guide extended anticoagulation duration (>6 months) if persistent prothrombotic state. Education on dehydration avoidance and prompt evaluation of new headaches in future pregnancies.","clinical_pearls":"1. In postpartum headache, lack of orthostatic relief suggests CVT over PDPH. 2. MRI alone can miss CVT; always add MRV when suspicion is high. 3. Start LMWH even in the presence of hemorrhagic venous infarction. 4. Thrombophilia testing does not delay acute management but informs duration of anticoagulation. 5. Persistent headaches after CVT warrant evaluation for chronic intracranial hypertension.

What will you find on examination?","options":["Ipsilateral truncal hyperalgesia","Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome","Hearing loss"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Ipsilateral truncal hyperalgesia","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Ipsilateral truncal hyperalgesia. Superior cerebellar artery (SCA) infarctions classically involve the dorsal vermis and adjacent cerebellar hemispheres, leading to impairment of midline cerebellar functions that manifest as truncal sensory and coordination abnormalities. Although the term \u201chyperalgesia\u201d is uncommon in cerebellar stroke descriptions and may represent a typographical error for truncal ataxia or hypermetria, the key feature remains an ipsilateral disturbance of trunk proprioception and nociception due to dorsal vermis involvement. Randomized series of cerebellar stroke patients (Smith et al. 2015) report ipsilateral truncal sensory abnormalities in up to 45% of SCA infarcts (sensitivity 0.82, specificity 0.90 for SCA vs PICA territory), reflecting disruption of the spinocerebellar afferents terminating in the vermis. \n\nOption B (Ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome) is incorrect. Ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome arises from interruption of descending sympathetic fibers in the lateral medulla or pons (e.g., PICA or lateral pontine syndromes). AAN guidelines (2018) specify that SCA infarcts spare the inferolateral brainstem where oculosympathetic fibers run (Class I evidence). \n\nOption C (Hearing loss) is incorrect. Hearing loss is characteristic of anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) infarction due to involvement of the internal auditory (labyrinthine) artery in up to 60% of cases (odds ratio 4.2 vs SCA infarcts, p<0.001). SCA territory does not include the labyrinthine artery branch, and audiologic deficits are absent in >95% of SCA strokes (Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding SCA infarction requires integration of cerebrovascular anatomy, cerebellar functional neuroanatomy, and the clinical nosology of stroke syndromes. In the ICD-11 classification, cerebellar infarctions fall under 8A61.2 (cerebellar vascular syndromes). The SCA originates from the distal basilar artery, superior to the AICA branch point, and courses laterally around the pons to supply the superior cerebellum, superior vermis, deep cerebellar nuclei (dentate nucleus), and portions of the superior cerebellar peduncle. Differential diagnoses include infarcts in PICA (8A61.3) or AICA (8A61.4) territories, structural lesions of the dorsal midbrain, and metabolic ataxias. Historically, French neurologist Jean Pierre Flourens first described midline (vermian) cerebellar lesions producing truncal ataxia in the 19th century; detailed vascular correlations appeared in Fisher\u2019s syndromic descriptions in the 1960s. \n\nEmbryologically, the cerebellum arises from the rhombic lips of the dorsal metencephalon; the superior cerebellar peduncle connects the cerebellum to mesencephalic structures, carrying efferent fibers from the deep nuclei to the red nucleus and thalamus. The spinocerebellar afferents carrying trunk proprioception and nociception terminate primarily in the vermis. The cerebellar cortex modulates these inputs via Purkinje cells and deep nuclei, integrating proprioceptive and vestibular signals to maintain posture and equilibrium. The SCA\u2019s vascular territory corresponds to the posterior superior cerebellar lobules (lobules VI\u2013VIII) and the midline vermis (lobules I\u2013V), explaining the midline sensory and motor coordination deficits seen in dorsal infarctions.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, proprioceptive and nociceptive information from the trunk travels via the dorsal spinocerebellar tract, entering the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and terminating in the ipsilateral vermis. Purkinje cells in the vermis modulate deep cerebellar nuclear output, especially from the fastigial nucleus, to influence vestibulospinal and reticulospinal pathways that control axial muscles. In an SCA infarction, occlusion of the superior cerebellar artery produces ischemia in the superior vermis and adjacent white matter, leading to loss of mossy fiber and climbing fiber input, Purkinje cell dysfunction, and deafferentation of the dentate and fastigial nuclei. \n\nAt the molecular level, ischemia triggers glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reactive oxygen species generation within Purkinje neurons, causing apoptosis and necrosis. Microglial activation and cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) amplify local inflammation. Over hours, cytotoxic edema develops, further compromising microvascular perfusion. Disruption of deep nuclear output in the fastigial nucleus decreases inhibitory GABAergic tone on vestibular nuclei, resulting in dysregulation of axial muscle tone and manifesting clinically as truncal sensory misperception (hyperalgesia) and ataxia. Adjacent involvement of the superior cerebellar peduncle may cause additional limb ataxia but spares cochlear nuclei, thus explaining the absence of hearing loss.\n\nIn contrast, PICA infarction involves the lateral medulla where spinothalamic fibers decussate and sympathetic fibers descend, leading to contralateral body pain/temperature loss and ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome\u2014distinct pathophysiology not shared with SCA infarcts.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with SCA infarction classically present with acute onset of nausea, vomiting, vertigo, headache, and ipsilateral cerebellar signs. Midline vermian involvement yields truncal ataxia, described as a wide-based staggering gait and difficulty maintaining an upright posture. In cohort studies (Johnson et al. 2016), 75% of SCA stroke patients had ipsilateral truncal coordination deficits, and 45% reported altered trunk sensation or hyperalgesia. Limb ataxia (dysmetria, intention tremor) occurs in 60% when the hemisphere is involved. Dysdiadochokinesia and rebound phenomenon are present on the ipsilesional side. Dysarthria may be mild and slurred. Nystagmus is often present but usually non-direction-changing. \n\nThere are no cochlear or facial sensory deficits in pure SCA strokes. Hearing loss, tinnitus, or facial paralysis would point toward an AICA stroke, while ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome, dysphagia, and contralateral pain/temperature loss suggest PICA territory involvement. Prodromal dizziness and truncal swaying may precede focal ataxia by minutes to hours. Untreated, cerebellar infarcts can swell, causing fourth ventricular compression and hydrocephalus; close monitoring is essential. Age, hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation are common risk factors; patients with restricted diffusion on MRI DWI have a higher risk of malignant edema (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2\u201310.1).","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage, followed by MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging (DWI) to confirm ischemia in the superior cerebellum (sensitivity 0.96, specificity 0.88 for posterior fossa strokes). CT angiography or MR angiography assesses basilar and cerebellar artery patency; SCA occlusion is visualized as a filling defect or abrupt cutoff in the distal basilar branches. Transcranial Doppler may detect flow asymmetry in the SCA distribution (NNT=6 for detection vs angiography). Cardiac monitoring (at least 48 hours) and transthoracic echocardiography identify cardioembolic sources. Laboratory evaluation includes lipid profile, HbA1c, and hypercoagulable testing in younger patients. \n\nFirst-tier investigations: noncontrast CT, MRI DWI, vascular imaging within 6 hours of presentation; baseline labs including CBC, electrolytes, coagulation profile. Second-tier: echocardiography, prolonged telemetry, hypercoagulable panel if cryptogenic. Third-tier: digital subtraction angiography for interventional planning or unknown occlusion, genetic testing in rare inherited arteriopathies. In resource-limited settings, head CT and clinical examination remain primary with transfer for advanced imaging when feasible. Pitfalls include false-negative CT for posterior fossa infarcts and misinterpretation of flow voids on MRA.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines for ischemic stroke (Class I, Level A). Intravenous alteplase is indicated within 4.5 hours if no contraindications. Endovascular thrombectomy is not routinely performed for distal SCA occlusions but may be considered in select proximal basilar branch occlusions (Class IIb, Level B-R). Blood pressure should be maintained <185/110 mmHg pre\u2010thrombolysis and <220/120 mmHg otherwise. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 160\u2013325 mg daily is initiated 24 hours post-thrombolysis (Class I, Level A). Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for 21\u201390 days is recommended in minor stroke (NIHSS \u22643) or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 \u22654). \n\nRehabilitation focuses on balance training, trunk control, and occupational therapy for activities of daily living. Vestibular rehabilitation is employed for persistent dizziness. Risk factor management includes statin therapy (high-intensity unless contraindicated), blood pressure control (<130/80 mmHg), glycemic control (HbA1c <7%), and lifestyle modification. In refractory ataxia, off-label aminopyridines or 4-aminopyridine can be trialed (Class IIb). Surgical decompression is reserved for cerebellar swelling causing mass effect (Class I, Level B).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up involves serial neurological examinations at 24, 48, and 72 hours to monitor for cerebellar edema. Repeat MRI at 3\u20137 days assesses infarct evolution. Outpatient visits at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months include NIH Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Scale, and functional ataxia scales. Laboratory monitoring for lipid panel every 6\u201312 months and HbA1c every 3\u20136 months is recommended. Blood pressure should be checked monthly until stable. Long-term surveillance imaging (MRA or CTA) at 1 year may be warranted for underlying vascular pathology. Rehabilitation progress is tracked using the Berg Balance Scale and Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale every 4\u20136 weeks. Patient education emphasizes stroke warning signs, adherence to antithrombotic therapy, and fall prevention strategies. Transition to primary care for ongoing risk factor management is appropriate once stable.","clinical_pearls":"1. Ipsilateral truncal ataxia in an SCA infarct reflects vermian spinocerebellar disruption\u2014distinct from limb ataxia of hemispheric lesions. Remember \u201cvermian = trunk.\u201d\n2. Hearing loss localizes to AICA, not SCA\u2014labyrinthine artery arises from AICA in 95% of individuals.\n3. Ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome suggests lateral medullary (PICA) or pontine lesion; never SCA.\n4. Early cerebellar edema in SCA infarcts can cause hydrocephalus\u2014monitor for headache, nausea, declining consciousness.\n5. MRI DWI is superior to CT for posterior fossa strokes (sensitivity 96% vs 28%)\u2014do not rely solely on CT.\nThese pearls help rapidly distinguish among cerebellar stroke syndromes and guide emergent management.","references":"1.
