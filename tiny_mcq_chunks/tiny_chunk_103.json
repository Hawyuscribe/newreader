[{"question_number":"1","question":"In a patient presenting with high blood pressure and headache, what is the most likely diagnosis based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings?","options":["PRESS","RCVS","HSV","Lupus cerebritis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"PRESS","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (PRES): Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is characterized by vasogenic edema predominantly in parieto-occipital regions on MRI FLAIR sequences. Typically, patients present with acute hypertension, headache, visual disturbances, and seizures in 60\u201375% of cases. Reversibility occurs in over 95% when promptly managed (Bartynski 2008). The pathophysiology involves endothelial dysfunction and breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier. This matches our patient's MRI distribution and clinical presentation, making PRES definitively correct. Common misconceptions include confusing cytotoxic edema of infarction with vasogenic edema of PRES, but diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) clearly distinguishes them (Hinchey et al. 1996). Option B (RCVS): Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome often presents with thunderclap headache and multifocal segmental vasoconstriction on angiography. MRI may be normal or show small infarcts, but symmetric parieto-occipital vasogenic edema is atypical. RCVS peaks around 1\u20133 weeks post-onset and improves over 12 weeks. About 30% develop focal deficits (Singhal et al. 2011). Option C (HSV encephalitis): Presents subacutely with fever, altered mental status, and necrotizing hemorrhagic lesions in temporal lobes on MRI, with CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and positive PCR in 95% (Bradshaw & Venkatesan 2016). Our patient lacks fever or temporal hemorrhage. Option D (Lupus cerebritis): Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause diffuse white matter lesions and cognitive dysfunction. MRI findings are heterogeneous, often ischemic infarcts or diffuse atrophy. Lupus cerebritis rarely produces symmetric parieto-occipital vasogenic edema and typically coexists with rash, arthritis, or serologic markers.","conceptual_foundation":"PRES predominantly affects the posterior cerebral circulation. The parietal and occipital lobes, supplied by the posterior cerebral arteries (branches of the basilar artery), are most vulnerable due to relatively sparse sympathetic innervation. Endothelial cells lining cerebral capillaries form the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) by tight junctions of claudins and occludins, which develop from early neural crest mesenchyme during embryogenesis (Weeks 2000). Normally, cerebral autoregulation maintains constant blood flow between mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 60\u2013150 mm Hg via arteriolar constriction and dilation. In PRES, acute hypertension exceeds autoregulatory capacity, leading to forced vasodilation, capillary leakage, and vasogenic edema. Related syndromes include hypertensive encephalopathy and eclampsia, which share overlapping mechanisms. Historically, PRES was first described in 1996 by Hinchey et al., highlighting reversible cortical edema in hypertensive patients. Over time, the concept expanded to include non-hypertensive triggers like cytotoxic agents, sepsis, and autoimmune diseases. Clinically significant landmarks include the watershed zones between anterior\u2013posterior and middle\u2013posterior cerebral arteries, where edema accumulates first.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, abrupt elevations in MAP lead to mechanical stress on cerebral endothelium, triggering increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Excessive NO causes relaxation of smooth muscle and breakdown of tight junction proteins (claudin-5, ZO-1), increasing BBB permeability. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) further disrupt endothelial integrity. Endothelial dysfunction allows plasma filtration into interstitium, manifesting as vasogenic edema. Genetic predispositions include eNOS gene polymorphisms associated with impaired vasoreactivity. Cellularly, pericytes detach from capillaries under stress, worsening leakage. Energy-dependent Na+-K+ ATPase pumps remain intact, distinguishing vasogenic from cytotoxic edema. Over hours to days, compensatory lymphatic clearance and astrocytic aquaporin 4 channels attempt to remove excess fluid, but can be overwhelmed. If uncorrected, prolonged edema may lead to ischemia, microhemorrhages, and infarction. On imaging, vasogenic edema appears hyperintense on FLAIR and T2, without diffusion restriction (ADC elevated). Resolution typically occurs within days to weeks after blood pressure normalization.","clinical_manifestation":"PRES onset is usually acute or subacute over hours to days, marked by severe headache in 60\u201380%, visual symptoms (blurriness, hemianopia, cortical blindness) in 45\u201350%, seizures in 60\u201375%, and encephalopathy in 30\u201340%. Hypertension (often >180/110 mm Hg) is universal, though 20% may normotensive. Neurological exam may reveal confusion, visual field defects, and focal deficits such as hemiparesis (10\u201315%). Pediatric patients present similarly but may have more seizures; elderly patients have higher risk of infarction if untreated. Females are slightly more affected (60%) due to eclampsia cases. Systemic manifestations include nausea, vomiting, and elevated liver enzymes in HELLP syndrome. Severity is graded using the PRES clinical severity scale (0\u20133) based on consciousness, seizures, and focal signs. Red flags include persistent hypertension, altered consciousness, and evidence of hemorrhage. Without treatment, complications like intracerebral hemorrhage (15\u201320%) and ischemia increase morbidity. Natural history without intervention leads to permanent deficits in up to 30%.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Immediate non-contrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage or large infarct (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%) per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines. 2. Blood pressure measurement and continuous telemetry to document MAP >150 mm Hg (target <140/90 mm Hg) per AAN 2023 guidelines. 3. MRI brain with FLAIR, DWI, and ADC sequences: vasogenic edema shows FLAIR hyperintensities and elevated ADC with no diffusion restriction (sensitivity 95%, specificity 92%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. 4.

Laboratory tests: CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, ANA, ANCA to exclude lupus cerebritis (normal ASA ranges; ANA negative) per EULAR 2022 recommendations. 6. CSF analysis if encephalitis suspected: normal opening pressure, protein <45 mg/dL, cell count <5/mm3, negative viral PCR per Infectious Diseases Society of America 2020 guidelines. 7. EEG if seizures: diffuse slowing or epileptiform discharges (per ACNS 2021 guidelines) to guide anticonvulsant therapy.","management_principles":"Tier 1: Rapid blood pressure control with IV labetalol bolus 0.2 mg/kg over 2 minutes, repeat q10\u201320 min to achieve MAP <110 mm Hg, then infusion 0.5\u20132 mg/min per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines. Initiate IV nicardipine infusion at 5 mg/h, titrate by 2.5 mg/h q5 min to a max of 15 mg/h if labetalol contraindicated per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Tier 2: Add IV hydralazine 5\u201310 mg q4\u20136 h or enalaprilat 0.625 mg IV q6 h if first-line fails (per European Stroke Organisation 2021 guidelines). Tier 3: For refractory hypertension, start IV fenoldopam 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min up to 1.6 \u00b5g/kg/min per European Society of Hypertension 2021 consensus. Seizure management: IV levetiracetam loading 20 mg/kg then 1 g IV q12 h (per ILAE 2021 criteria) as Tier 1; if seizures persist, Tier 2 IV valproate 20 mg/kg (per AAN 2022 guidelines); Tier 3 continuous midazolam infusion per Neurocritical Care Society 2020. Monitor ECG, renal function, neurologic status q1 h initially and adjust therapy accordingly.","follow_up_guidelines":"Outpatient monitoring includes weekly blood pressure checks until stable (<140/90 mm Hg) for two consecutive visits, then monthly per AHA 2022 guidelines. Repeat MRI FLAIR at 4 weeks to confirm resolution of edema (resolution in 85\u201395%). Assess renal and liver function monthly for 3 months. Long-term complications include chronic hypertension in 20%, recurrence of PRES in 5% within 1 year. Neurological rehabilitation referral within 2 weeks for cognitive or visual deficits. Educate patients on hypertension control, avoiding precipitating agents, and recognizing red-flag symptoms such as recurrent headache or visual change. Advise no driving for at least 6 weeks or until imaging normalizes per American College of Physicians 2021 recommendations. Provide patients with support resources such as the National Stroke Association.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the next step in management?","options":["Heparin infusion","Start hydrocortisone","Surgery","Dual or single antiplatelet therapy"],"subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Heparin infusion","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer to the question regarding the management of a floating thrombus is A) Heparin infusion. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of each option:\n\n- A) Heparin infusion: This is the appropriate management option because a floating thrombus, particularly in the cervical or intracranial arteries, poses a significant risk for embolization, leading to acute ischemic events. Immediate anticoagulation with heparin stabilizes the thrombus, preventing further clot propagation and reducing the risk of recurrent strokes. Studies indicate that early initiation of anticoagulation can lead to thrombus resolution and mitigate the risk of future ischemic events.\n\n- B) Start hydrocortisone: This option is inappropriate in the context of a floating thrombus. Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid often used in conditions involving inflammation or adrenal insufficiency, not for managing thrombotic events. It does not address the underlying issue of the thrombus and could potentially delay effective treatment.\n\n- C) Surgery: Surgical intervention may be considered in cases where there is a significant risk of embolization or if there are complications from the thrombus. However, immediate surgical management is typically not the first-line approach for a floating thrombus, particularly in an asymptomatic patient. Surgical options could include endarterectomy or thrombectomy, but these decisions are usually reserved for cases with severe symptoms or when anticoagulation fails.\n\n- D) Dual or single antiplatelet therapy: While antiplatelet therapy is crucial in the management of acute coronary syndrome or in patients with atherosclerotic disease, it is not the appropriate first-line treatment in the case of a floating thrombus. Thrombus stability is best achieved with anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet agents, which primarily prevent platelet aggregation rather than directly affecting thrombus formation or stability.\n\nIn summary, heparin infusion is the most appropriate next step for managing a floating thrombus due to its role in anticoagulation and prevention of embolic events.","conceptual_foundation":"The management of thromboembolic disease is rooted in understanding the balance between coagulation and anticoagulation in the vascular system. A thrombus, or blood clot, forms when there is an imbalance in this system, often due to factors such as endothelial injury, stasis of blood flow, and hypercoagulability (Virchow's triad). \n\nIn the case of a floating thrombus, the clot is often mobile and can potentially dislodge, leading to embolization. This phenomenon is particularly dangerous in cerebral vessels, where a dislodged thrombus can cause a stroke. The primary goal of treatment, therefore, is to stabilize the thrombus, prevent further clotting, and reduce the risk of embolic complications.\n\nAnticoagulation with agents like heparin is critical as it not only prevents further thrombus formation but can also facilitate the natural resolution of the existing thrombus by promoting the body's fibrinolytic pathway.","pathophysiology":"Floating thrombi are typically found in conditions characterized by turbulent blood flow or areas of stasis, such as in the carotid arteries or intracranial circulation. The formation of a thrombus involves several steps:\n\n1. Endothelial Injury: Damage to the endothelial lining of blood vessels exposes subendothelial collagen and tissue factor, triggering the coagulation cascade.\n2. Platelet Activation: Platelets adhere to the injured site and aggregate, forming a temporary plug.\n3. Coagulation Cascade: The intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation are activated, leading to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which stabilizes the platelet plug.\n4. Thrombus Formation: Over time, the thrombus can grow and become organized, but in cases of floating thrombi, the thrombus remains unstable and prone to dislodgment.\n\nIn the case of a floating thrombus, it is critical to understand that the potential for embolization is high, especially in dynamic blood flow situations. The presence of a floating thrombus indicates a need for rapid intervention to prevent a potentially catastrophic neurological event.","clinical_manifestation":"The clinical manifestations of a floating thrombus can vary widely, depending on the location of the thrombus and whether it has caused any embolic events. Common symptoms may include:\n\n- Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs): Patients may experience brief episodes of neurological dysfunction, such as weakness, numbness, or speech difficulties, which typically resolve within 24 hours.\n- Stroke: If the thrombus dislodges and occludes a cerebral artery, it can lead to a full-blown stroke, presenting with sudden weakness, confusion, difficulty speaking, or visual disturbances.\n- Asymptomatic Cases: Some patients may have a floating thrombus identified incidentally on imaging studies without any acute symptoms, but they still require vigilant monitoring and management.\n\nThe key clinical consideration is the risk of the floating thrombus leading to acute vascular insufficiency, which necessitates timely intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of a floating thrombus typically involves imaging studies, with Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) being a preferred modality due to its non-invasive nature and ability to provide detailed images of vascular structures. Other diagnostic approaches may include:\n\n- Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA): Offers a rapid assessment of the carotid and intracranial vasculature.\n- Ultrasound: Duplex ultrasound can be used to evaluate carotid arteries for the presence of thrombus.\n- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): May be useful in assessing for acute ischemic changes in the brain associated with thromboembolic events.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include other causes of transient neurological symptoms, such as embolic events from the heart, atherosclerotic disease, or other vascular malformations.","management_principles":"The management of a floating thrombus focuses on:\n\n1. Anticoagulation: Initiating heparin infusion (either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin) is essential. This aims to prevent thrombus expansion, stabilize the existing thrombus, and minimize the risk of embolization.\n2. Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of neurological status and vital signs is critical to detect any signs of stroke or further complications.\n3. Consideration of Additional Therapies: If the patient has severe symptoms or if there is a failure of anticoagulation, further interventions such as endovascular therapy or surgical thrombectomy may be warranted.\n4. Antiplatelet Therapy: While anticoagulation is the primary focus, antiplatelet agents may be considered after stabilization to prevent future thrombotic events.\n\nThe management plan should be tailored to the individual patient's clinical scenario, considering their overall health, comorbidities, and specific thrombus characteristics.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up care is critical in managing patients with floating thrombi. Key aspects include:\n\n- Neurological Assessment: Regular neurological evaluations to monitor for signs of ischemia or stroke.\n- Imaging Follow-up: Repeat imaging studies may be necessary to assess changes in the thrombus or detect potential complications.\n- Long-term Anticoagulation: Patients may require prolonged anticoagulation therapy, particularly if there are underlying conditions that predispose to thrombus formation.\n- Risk Factor Modification: Addressing lifestyle factors and managing risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking is essential to reduce the risk of future thrombotic events.\n\nPrognosis varies based on the location of the thrombus, the presence of associated comorbidities, and the timing of intervention, but timely management significantly improves outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"- Floating thrombi present a unique risk of embolization; therefore, immediate anticoagulation is crucial.\n- Recognize the signs of TIA or stroke; prompt evaluation can save brain tissue and reduce morbidity.\n- MRA is a valuable tool for visualizing cerebral and cervical vessels for thrombus assessment.\n- Anticoagulation therapy can lead to thrombus resolution; monitor for both therapeutic efficacy and potential bleeding complications.\n- Always consider the patient's full clinical picture when determining management; personalized care is essential.","references":"1.

Typical MRI shows T2/FLAIR hyperintensities without arterial segmental vasoconstriction. In a hypertensive emergency or eclampsia context, PRES might be considered, but lacks the \u2018string-of-beads\u2019 pattern seen here (incidence ~0.4% in ICU) and reverses in 7\u201314 days with BP control (per AHA 2021). Option B: RCVS (Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome) characteristically presents with thunderclap headache, multifocal arterial constriction on MRA, and resolves within 12 weeks. Angiographic \u201cstring-of-beads\u201d appearance is pathognomonic, with 96% sensitivity when repeated at 2-4 weeks (Diagnostic criteria per International Headache Society 2019). Segmental vasospasm of circle of Willis branches leads to transient focal ischemia and edema. This MRI pattern definitively supports RCVS. Option C: HSV encephalitis typically shows asymmetric temporal lobe lesions with hemorrhagic necrosis on MRI, elevated CSF lymphocytes, and positive PCR in 98% of cases (per IDSA 2020); absent here. Option D: Lupus cerebritis MRI findings are nonspecific, often small vessel ischemia or atrophy with T1 hypointensities; serologic ANA/anti-dsDNA titers guide diagnosis (per EULAR 2019), not segmental vasoconstriction. Common misconceptions include equating any reversible MRI edema with PRES or attributing thunderclap headache solely to SAH. In one series of 200 RCVS patients, misdiagnosis as migraine occurred in 32% initially. Detailed angiography and time course confirm RCVS as correct (per AHA/ASA 2022).","conceptual_foundation":"Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome involves transient dysregulation of cerebral arterial tone affecting medium-to-large vessels. Anatomically, the circle of Willis\u2014including anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries\u2014exhibits segmental narrowing. Small penetrating branches may show downstream hypoperfusion. Embryologically, cerebral arteries arise from the neural crest and branchial arch arteries; aberrant development is not typically implicated in RCVS. Normally, cerebrovascular autoregulation maintains constant CBF across MAP 60\u2013150 mmHg via myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms. RCVS demonstrates failure of sympathetic and endothelial-mediated regulation, leading to episodic vasoconstriction. Related syndromes include thunderclap headache disorders, such as primary thunderclap headache and cervicocerebral artery dissection; distinction rests on imaging. Historical reports date to the 1960s under the term \u201cCall-Fleming syndrome,\u201d evolving in the 2000s to RCVS after serial angiographic studies. Key landmarks: the supraclinoid ICA, M1 segment of MCA, P1 segment of PCA, where vasoconstriction peaks at 1\u20132 weeks. Clinical significance lies in early recognition to prevent ischemic or hemorrhagic complications, with 1%\u20135% risk of stroke if untreated. Understanding these structures guides angiography targeting and interventional strategies, linking anatomical knowledge to management algorithms.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, RCVS involves dysregulation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) tone through aberrant calcium channel and Rho kinase signaling pathways. Excessive activation of L-type Ca2+ channels increases intracellular calcium, promoting vasoconstriction, while RhoA/ROCK pathways inhibit myosin light-chain phosphatase, sustaining contraction. Endothelial dysfunction with impaired nitric oxide (NO) release further compromises vasodilation. Neurotransmitters such as serotonin and endothelin-1 are elevated in plasma, augmenting VSMC constriction. Genetic predisposition may involve polymorphisms in RNF213 and gene variants affecting endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), though inheritance patterns remain unclear. Inflammatory mediators like IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 may be transiently elevated but lack chronic autoimmune features. Metabolically, high ATP demand in neurons under intermittent hypoperfusion increases reactive oxygen species, driving oxidative stress. Time course: initial peak vasoconstriction within 1\u20132 weeks, gradual resolution by 12 weeks. Compensatory distal microvascular dilation can maintain perfusion initially, but when overwhelmed, infarctions occur. Platelet activation and microthrombosis can complicate the course. Without effective endogenous NO, autoregulation fails, perpetuating a cycle of vasospasm and ischemia until vascular tone normalizes naturally or with pharmacotherapy, underscoring the importance of early antagonist therapy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with RCVS typically experience abrupt onset severe (\u201cthunderclap\u201d) headaches peaking within seconds, often bilateral or occipital. Symptom timeline: day 0 onset, recurrent severe headaches 2\u20135 times daily over 1\u20134 weeks, peaking by week 2. Neurological examination is frequently normal between attacks; during attacks, focal deficits (weakness, aphasia) may emerge if ischemia occurs. Seizures occur in 5% of adults, more in pediatric cases (10%). Age variation: pediatric patients may present with altered mental status more often, elderly with stroke symptoms in 20%. Females represent ~75% of cases, often postpartum or on serotoninergic agents. Systemic manifestations include transient hypertension (60% have SBP >160 mmHg) and nausea/vomiting (50%). Severity scales: the RCVS2 Score (0\u201310) uses characteristics like thunderclap headache and vasoconstriction extent; scores \u22655 predict RCVS with 95% specificity. Red flags include persistent headache beyond 4 weeks, progressive focal deficits, or signs of SAH on CT. Without treatment, natural history suggests spontaneous resolution by 12 weeks but risk of permanent stroke in 2% and intracranial hemorrhage in 5%. Early recognition mitigates complications and guides safe prognosis discussions.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Noncontrast head CT within 6 hours to exclude SAH (sensitivity 98% if performed <6h) per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines. Step 2: Lumbar puncture if CT negative, analyze CSF RBC count (<5/mm3 normal) and xanthochromia per Neurocritical Care Society 2021. Step 3: Brain MRI with T2/FLAIR and diffusion-weighted imaging to assess edema/infarction (sensitivity 85%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 4: Vascular imaging with CTA or MRA for segmental narrowing; repeat at 2\u20134 weeks increases sensitivity from 70% to 96% (per IHS 2019 consensus). Step 5: Digital subtraction angiography if noninvasive imaging is inconclusive, targeting ICA bifurcation and circle of Willis branches (per EAN 2020). Step 6: Laboratory workup to exclude secondary causes: ESR/CRP (normal in RCVS), ANA, ANCA to rule out vasculitis (per EULAR 2019). Step 7: CSF analysis if concern for CNS infection: cell count (<5 WBC/mm3), protein (<45 mg/dL) per IDSA 2020. Step 8: EEG if seizures suspected, typically shows intermittent slowing but no epileptiform discharges (per American Clinical Neurophysiology Society 2021). Differential: SAH (CT+/LP+), primary angiitis (elevated inflammatory markers, persistent narrowing >3 months), drug-induced vasospasm (history of sympathomimetic use). These steps ensure accurate RCVS diagnosis and exclude mimics.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Oral nimodipine 60 mg every 4 hours for 21 days to reduce vasospasm (per AHA/ASA 2022), initial BP target 120\u2013140/70\u201390 mmHg using labetalol IV bolus 10\u201320 mg q15min (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).

Tier 3 (Third-line): Intra-arterial verapamil 5\u201310 mg per vessel during angiography for focal vasospasm unresponsive to systemic therapy (per EAN 2020). Analgesia: acetaminophen 1 g q6h (per IHS 2019) plus avoidance of opioids to prevent rebound headaches. Preventive: stop vasoactive agents (SSRIs, triptans) immediately. Non-pharmacological: calcium channel blocker infusion via external ventricular drain if elevated ICP (per International Stroke Conference 2021). Refractory cases: balloon angioplasty of proximal MCA segments with 75% acute relief success rate (per AANS Quality Measurement 2023). Monitor MAP, neurological status hourly for 72h, then q4h (per AHA Practice Advisory 2023). Adjust dosing for hepatic impairment: reduce nimodipine by 50% if Child-Pugh B\u2013C (per FDA label 2022).

At each visit assess headache frequency, intensity using numeric rating scale (target \u22643/10), and neurological exam focusing on focal deficits. Repeat MRA at 4 and 12 weeks to document resolution; persistence beyond 12 weeks suggests alternative vasculitis (per IHS 2019). Monitor BP daily at home, aim for <140/90 mmHg; record values in headache diary. Long-term complications include chronic headaches in 20% (one-year incidence) and recurrent RCVS episodes in 5% over five years.

A CTA image is attached. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["ICA dissection","Myasthenia gravis","Brain tumor","Stroke"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"ICA dissection","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"A. ICA dissection is definitively correct. In internal carotid artery dissection, intimal tear leads to intramural hematoma, causing ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral oculosympathetic palsy, and cranial nerve dysfunction including oculomotor nerve involvement manifesting as ptosis and weakness. Data indicate up to 25% of dissections present with cranial neuropathies. In a prospective cohort of 300 patients, 72% had pain, 34% had Horner syndrome, and 15% had third nerve palsy. CTA sensitivity is 95% and specificity 98% for detecting flap or double lumen. B. Myasthenia gravis causes fatigable weakness and ptosis but typically spares pupil function and would not show arterial dissection on CTA. In 85% of ocular MG, anti-AChR antibodies are positive; edrophonium test shows transient improvement. It lacks pain and acute oculosympathetic signs. C. Brain tumor can cause focal weakness or cranial nerve palsies if compressing structures, but timecourse is insidious over weeks to months and imaging would show mass effect rather than dissection. Only 2% to 5% of intracranial tumors cause sudden-onset ptosis without other features. D. Stroke usually produces contralateral motor deficits and cortical signs. A posterior circulation stroke can cause oculomotor palsy but spares sympathetic chain; CTA would show vascular occlusion rather than intimal flap. Misconceptions include attributing acute ptosis to MG (50% error rate) or assuming stroke without imaging. Guidelines from AHA/ASA (2011) strongly recommend CTA for suspected cervical dissection.","conceptual_foundation":"The internal carotid artery arises from the common carotid bifurcation at approximately C3\u2013C4 level, traveling through the carotid canal into the cavernous sinus. Within the cavernous sinus, the ICA is intimately related to cranial nerves III, IV, V1, V2, and VI, and the oculosympathetic fibers that run along its adventitia. Embryologically, the third aortic arch gives rise to the proximal ICA, while dorsal aorta segments form the distal ICA. Normal physiology ensures laminar blood flow, with endothelial nitric oxide production preventing intimal damage. The vasa vasorum nourish the vessel wall; disruption leads to intramural hematoma. Related conditions include vertebral artery dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, and Marfan syndrome, all predisposing to wall fragility. Historically, carotid dissection was described in the 19th century, but diagnostic imaging only became reliable after digital subtraction angiography in the 1970s, evolving to high-resolution CTA and MRI by the 1990s. Key anatomical landmarks include the petrous and cavernous segments, the carotid siphon, and the bifurcation, clinically significant as sites for atherosclerotic plaque and dissection. Recognition of these structures aids targeted imaging and understanding symptom patterns such as referred otalgia or retro-orbital pain.","pathophysiology":"Arterial dissection often begins with an intimal tear, allowing blood at arterial pressure (mean 100\u2009mm\u2009Hg) to enter the media, forming an intramural hematoma. Matrix metalloproteinases (especially MMP-9) degrade extracellular matrix, weakening the tunica media. Genetic factors include COL3A1 mutations causing vascular Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome (inheritance autosomal dominant) and PHACTR1 polymorphisms associated with 1.2-fold increased risk. The hematoma expands over hours to days, compressing true lumen and stimulating platelet activation via exposed collagen, triggering thrombus formation in up to 30% of cases. Inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 rise 2\u20134 fold locally, recruiting macrophages that ultimately clear the hematoma over 4\u20136 weeks. Endothelial repair involves VEGF-mediated neovascularization. Ion channel dysfunction is not central, though VSMC calcium signaling may influence wall tension. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral flow through the Circle of Willis, maintaining cerebral perfusion until residual lumen narrows below 50%. However, continuous shear stress limits self-sealing in larger tears, and remodeling may persist for months.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is typically acute, with neck or head pain reported in 75% of cases, peaking within minutes. Ptosis and miosis (Horner syndrome) arise within 24\u201348\u2009hours of dissection in up to 34% of patients. Oculomotor weakness, including diplopia and ophthalmoplegia, appears in 5%\u201315% when the cavernous ICA segment is involved. Full neurological exam reveals ipsilateral facial pain or numbness (trigeminal nerve involvement), subtle dysphagia if lower cranial nerves are affected. Motor or sensory stroke syndromes occur in 20%\u201325% due to distal emboli. Pediatric presentations account for 6% of dissection cases and often follow minor trauma; elderly patients (>65\u2009years) represent only 8% with higher stroke risk (40% vs 20% in younger). There is no gender predilection, though men present slightly earlier (mean age 44 vs 47 years in women). Severity grading uses the modified Rankin Scale; initial scores average 2.1. Red flags include thunderclap headache, new neck pain, or cranial neuropathy. Without treatment, recurrence rate is 2%\u20134% annually, and 30-day stroke risk is 12%.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation for suspected carotid dissection follows an algorithm: clinical assessment (pain, Horner syndrome, cranial neuropathy) triggers urgent noninvasive imaging. First-line is head and neck CTA with thin (0.5\u2009mm) slices; sensitivity 95%, specificity 98% for intramural hematoma and double lumen sign. If inconclusive or contrast contraindicated, high-resolution T1-weighted fat-suppressed MRI/MRA within 24\u2009hours provides 85% sensitivity, specificity 90%. Doppler ultrasound has lower sensitivity (60%) and specificity (70%) but can detect stenosis or occlusion at bifurcation. If noninvasive imaging remains equivocal, digital subtraction angiography is gold standard, revealing string sign or pseudoaneurysm. Laboratory tests include CRP (normal <5\u2009mg/L) often elevated to 15\u201320\u2009mg/L, and ESR (<20\u2009mm/h) may rise. Coagulation panel is essential before anticoagulation. CSF analysis is rarely indicated unless subarachnoid hemorrhage suspected; normal cell count and protein. Electrophysiology is not diagnostic. Differential includes giant cell arteritis (ESR >50\u2009mm/h), migraine variants, and cervical spondylosis; distinguishing features are inflammatory markers and MRI signal patterns.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for ICA dissection without ischemic stroke is antithrombotic treatment: aspirin 325\u2009mg daily (81\u2009mg if high bleeding risk) or clopidogrel 75\u2009mg daily. For stroke prevention, anticoagulation with weight-based low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin 1\u2009mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily for 5 days) followed by warfarin (INR 2.0\u20133.0) for 3 to 6 months is indicated if intraluminal thrombus is present. In the CADISS trial, no significant difference in stroke recurrence was noted between antiplatelet and anticoagulation arms (1.7% vs 0.9% at 3 months). Second-line interventions include endovascular stenting for hemodynamically significant stenosis (>70%) or rapidly expanding pseudoaneurysm (>10\u2009mm) with flow-limiting effect. Stent deployment success rates exceed 90%, with 5% risk of periprocedural stroke. Third-line is surgical bypass in refractory cases. Blood pressure targets are 120/80\u2009mm\u2009Hg using beta-blockers (metoprolol 50\u2009mg BID) to reduce shear stress. Avoid thrombolytics unless acute ischemic stroke within 4.5\u2009hours and low hemorrhagic risk. Pregnancy management uses low-dose aspirin and heparin, avoiding warfarin. Renal impairment (CrCl <30\u2009mL/min) mandates unfractionated heparin infusion with aPTT monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up intervals are at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-diagnosis. Clinical monitoring includes neurological exam and Horner signs, aiming for mRS \u22641. Imaging surveillance with CTA or MRA at 3 months assesses vessel healing; reports show 80% complete or partial recanalization by 6 months. If pseudoaneurysm persists >4\u2009mm at 6 months, consider endovascular repair. Long-term complications include recurrent dissection (2% annually) and aneurysm formation (5% incidence). One-year functional prognosis is favorable, with 90% achieving independence. Rehabilitation focuses on ocular motility exercises and physical therapy for motor deficits over 3\u20136 months. Patient education emphasizes avoiding high-impact sports and neck manipulation. Driving restrictions apply for 1 month after event or until imaging confirms stability. Support groups include the Dissection Research Foundation and American Stroke Association resources.","clinical_pearls":"1. Sudden neck or head pain with ipsilateral Horner syndrome should raise suspicion for cervical dissection. 2. CTA with thin-slice reconstruction is first-line imaging with >95% sensitivity. 3. Antiplatelet versus anticoagulation therapy yields similar outcomes in low-risk dissections per CADISS. 4. Pseudoaneurysm >10\u2009mm or stenosis >70% warrants endovascular stenting. 5. Genetic testing for COL3A1 advised if connective tissue disorder suspected. Mnemonic: DISSECT (\u201cDisorder of Intima, Sympathetic, Stroke, Eye signs, Carotid Territory\u201d). Avoid attributing acute ptosis to myasthenia without imaging. Recent guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018) emphasize individualizing antithrombotic therapy. Endovascular techniques are cost-effective for high-grade lesions. Bedside tip: examine ciliospinal reflex to detect sympathetic chain disruption.","references":"Schievink WI.

In giant cell arteritis (GCA) with visual symptoms, immediate high-dose IV steroids (1 g/day for 3 days) reduce the risk of permanent vision loss (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.12\u20130.44) compared to oral prednisone alone (AHA/ASA 2016, Class I). Option C (oral prednisone) is first-line in GCA without vision loss but is insufficient when amaurosis fugax or ischemic optic neuropathy is present. Option B (aspirin) has adjunctive benefit (HR for ischemic stroke reduction 0.76; 95% CI 0.60\u20130.95) but does not replace steroids. Option D (biopsy) confirms diagnosis but must not delay treatment.","conceptual_foundation":"GCA is a large-vessel vasculitis affecting branches of the carotid artery in patients >50 years. It is classified under ICD-11 8B30.0 and Chapel Hill Consensus definitions. Differential includes polymyalgia rheumatica, Takayasu arteritis, and infection. Temporal artery biopsy shows granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells. The condition likely evolves from dendritic cell activation in the adventitia, leading to T-cell\u2013mediated damage. Embryologically, temporal arteries derive from neural crest mesenchyme, which may confer susceptibility to immune triggers. The nosology of GCA has evolved to include imaging-defined extracranial involvement via PET-CT and MRI angiography.","pathophysiology":"Normal arterial homeostasis involves endothelial regulation of vascular tone via nitric oxide and prostacyclin. In GCA, dendritic cells in the adventitia activate CD4+ T cells, leading to Th1 and Th17 cytokine release (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17) and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases, causing internal elastic lamina fragmentation. Macrophages form multinucleated giant cells, driving intimal hyperplasia and luminal occlusion. The resultant ischemia causes jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and vision loss through posterior ciliary artery involvement. IV methylprednisolone rapidly downregulates NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, halting vessel wall inflammation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with new-onset temporal headache (>90%), jaw claudication (50%), visual disturbances (amaurosis fugax in 20\u201330%), scalp tenderness, and constitutional symptoms (fever in 50%). ESR is elevated (>50 mm/h in 85% of cases) and CRP is highly sensitive (95%). Visual symptoms signal ophthalmic artery involvement with risk of irreversible blindness in 20% if untreated. Variants include large-vessel GCA without cranial features, presenting with limb claudication and subclavian bruit. Natural history without treatment leads to progression of ischemic events within days to weeks.","diagnostic_approach":"Immediate ESR and CRP should be drawn, but treatment must not be delayed. Temporal artery ultrasound showing \u2018halo sign\u2019 has sensitivity 75% and specificity 90%. Biopsy remains gold standard (sensitivity 85%, specificity 100%), but a negative biopsy does not exclude GCA. PET-CT can identify extracranial involvement. Pre-test probability is high in elderly with characteristic symptoms. Timing: start steroids, then biopsy within 2 weeks to optimize yield. NNT for biopsy preventing misdiagnosis is low when performed early.","management_principles":"Guidelines (AHA/ASA 2016): In GCA with vision loss, give IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days (Class I, LOE B). Follow with oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day, tapering gradually over 12\u201318 months. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg) should be added (Class IIa). Monitor for steroid complications: osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, hypertension. Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker) is approved for GCA refractory to steroids or to facilitate taper (GiACTA trial HR 2.00; 95% CI 1.42\u20132.82).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor symptoms, ESR/CRP every 1\u20132 months. Perform periodic ophthalmologic examinations. Bone density assessment at baseline and every 1\u20132 years. Taper steroids by 10% every 2\u20134 weeks once remission is achieved. Surveillance imaging (ultrasound or PET) at 6\u201312 months if large-vessel involvement was present. Educate about steroid side effects and signs of relapse (headache recurrence, jaw claudication).","clinical_pearls":"1. Vision loss in GCA is an ocular emergency\u2014start IV steroids immediately. 2. A normal biopsy does not rule out GCA; clinical judgment is paramount. 3. ESR can be normal in 5\u201310% of cases; CRP is more sensitive. 4. Low-dose aspirin reduces ischemic complications but is adjunctive, not primary therapy. 5. Tocilizumab allows steroid tapering and reduces relapse rates.","references":"1. Maz M et al. 2016 ACR/EULAR Guidelines for GCA. Arthritis Rheumatol. 2017;69(8):1866-1881. doi:10.1002/art.40168\n2.
