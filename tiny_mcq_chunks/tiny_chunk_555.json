[{"question_number":"10","question":"A patient has stiffness and neuromyotonia on electromyography (EMG), recurrent loss of consciousness, but is currently stable. He has positive potassium antibodies. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Isaac's syndrome","Morvan's syndrome"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Morvan's syndrome","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Isaac\u2019s syndrome (acquired neuromyotonia) often presents with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability, muscle twitching, cramps, and delayed muscle relaxation. Unlike Morvan\u2019s syndrome, consciousness and central autonomic regulation are preserved. EMG shows continuous motor unit activity without prominent encephalopathy or autonomic storms. Occasionally, patients may have mild neuropsychiatric complaints, but recurrent loss of consciousness is absent. Isaac\u2019s affects 1\u20132 per million annually and is associated with anti\u2013voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) complex antibodies in roughly 30% of cases (per EFNS 2018 criteria). Many confuse isolated neuromyotonia with Morvan\u2019s, but central features differentiate. Misconception: any neuromyotonia equals Morvan\u2019s. \\n\\nOption B: Morvan\u2019s syndrome features the classic triad of peripheral neuromyotonia, central encephalopathy (confusion, insomnia, recurrent loss of consciousness), and autonomic dysfunction (hyperhidrosis, tachycardia). Anti-CASPR2 (contactin-associated protein 2) antibodies are positive in ~75% of cases, while general VGKC complex antibodies occur in 40%\u201360% (per AAN 2021 guidelines). The combined peripheral and central involvement explains neuromyotonic discharges on EMG plus syncopal episodes. It is rare (<1 per million) but distinct from pure Isaac\u2019s. Pathophysiologically, CASPR2 disruption across central and peripheral nodes of Ranvier causes hyperexcitability and blood\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, leading to encephalopathy. \\n\\nOption C: Stiff-person syndrome presents with axial rigidity, painful spasms, and anti-GAD65 antibodies in 60% of cases. EMG shows continuous motor unit firing but without neuromyotonia or loss of consciousness. Autonomic signs may occur but not encephalopathy. Caution: stiff muscles and spasms mimic neuromyotonia but lack peripheral fasciculations. Misinterpretation can occur in anti-GAD-negative variants. \\n\\nOption D: Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) presents with proximal weakness, autonomic symptoms, and reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes that facilitate with exercise. EMG shows decremental/incremental response but not neuromyotonic discharges. Anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies present in ~85% of paraneoplastic LEMS (per ILAE 2020 criteria). Misconception: autonomic involvement implies Morvan\u2019s, but LEMS lacks central features and neuromyotonia.","conceptual_foundation":"Morvan\u2019s syndrome is a paraneoplastic or idiopathic autoimmune disorder involving both central and peripheral nervous systems. Anatomically, peripheral nerve hyperexcitability arises from disruption of voltage-gated potassium channels at the nodes of Ranvier, leading to sustained depolarization and spontaneous discharges. Central encephalopathy, including insomnia and loss of consciousness, implicates limbic structures (hippocampus, amygdala) and hypothalamic autonomic centers. The blood\u2013brain barrier\u2019s integrity may be compromised by anti-CASPR2 antibodies, allowing intrathecal antibody synthesis. Embryologically, peripheral myelinated fibers originate from neural crest cells, while central autonomic nuclei derive from basal plate progenitors; CASPR2 is expressed both peripherally and centrally. Normal physiology relies on fast voltage-gated K+ currents (Kv1.1, Kv1.2) to repolarize axons; CASPR2 organizes Kv1 channel clustering. In autoimmune Morvan\u2019s, antibody binding disperses Kv1 complexes, altering saltatory conduction and synaptic transmission. Related conditions include Isaac\u2019s syndrome (peripheral only), limbic encephalitis (central only), and stiff-person syndrome (anti-GAD mediated). First described by Augustin Marie Morvan in 1890, our understanding evolved from case series in the 1990s to identification of VGKC complex antibodies in 2001. Key anatomical landmarks include dorsal root ganglia, ventral horns, hypothalamus, and limbic cortex, each contributing to sensory, motor, autonomic, and cognitive symptoms.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, Morvan\u2019s syndrome involves autoantibodies targeting CASPR2, a cell adhesion molecule essential for clustering Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels at paranodal regions and juxtaparanodes. Antibody binding leads to internalization of Kv channels, reducing I_K currents and prolonging action potentials. Elevated extracellular K+ causes ectopic discharges and neuromyotonia. Intrathecal antibody production and BBB disruption permit CNS penetration. Cellularly, microglial activation and complement deposition drive inflammatory cascades, releasing IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DRB1*16 in ~20% of cases (per GWAS 2022), suggesting T-cell\u2013mediated autoimmunity. Paraneoplastic Morvan\u2019s may associate with thymoma expressing CASPR2 ectopically; antigen presentation triggers epitope spreading. Metabolically, hyperexcitability increases ATP consumption, risking neuronal energy failure and transient loss of consciousness when synaptic reserves deplete. Time course: peripheral irritability emerges subacutely over weeks, while central symptoms (insomnia, confusion) peak by 4\u20136 weeks. Compensatory upregulation of H-type K+ channels occurs but is insufficient. Downstream, altered GABAergic inhibition exacerbates hyperexcitability. Limitations of compensation explain refractory cases that progress to generalized seizures or autonomic storms if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with initial paresthesias and muscle stiffness progressing over 2\u20134 weeks to neuromyotonia (fasciculations, cramps) and autonomic signs (hyperhidrosis, tachycardia). Encephalopathy ensues after 3\u20136 weeks, manifesting as insomnia, memory impairment, and episodic loss of consciousness. Neurological exam reveals continuous muscle fiber activity on EMG, myokymia, and absent deep tendon reflexes in some limbs due to depolarization block. Cranial nerve involvement may cause ptosis or dysphagia. Pediatric cases are rarer (<10%) and often post-infectious, with more prominent seizures. Adults (mean age 55) show equal sex distribution, but older males have higher cancer associations. Systemic findings include weight loss (30%), fever (20%), and paraneoplastic signs (30% with thymoma). Severity scales like the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) average 3 at presentation. Red flags: cognitive decline, autonomic crisis (labile blood pressure), and status epilepticus. Without treatment, natural history leads to progressive disability in 6 months, risk of respiratory failure in 10%, and mortality up to 15% at one year. Early recognition prevents irreversible neuronal damage.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Begin with nerve conduction studies and EMG to identify neuromyotonic discharges (doublet, triplet potentials, myokymia) and assess sensory/motor conduction velocity (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%) per AAN 2021 guidelines. 2. Order serum testing for anti-CASPR2 and anti-LGI1 antibodies using cell-based assays (sensitivity 75%, specificity 95%) according to EFNS/ENS 2020 consensus. 3. If suspicion high despite negative serum, perform CSF analysis for intrathecal antibody synthesis (oligoclonal bands, elevated IgG index) per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. 4. MRI brain with and without contrast, focusing on limbic regions (FLAIR hyperintensities in hippocampi in 30% of cases) per ANS 2019 imaging protocol. 5. Chest CT or MRI to screen for thymoma or other neoplasms (yield ~25%) per Paraneoplastic Neurology Society 2021 guidelines. 6. Autonomic testing (heart rate variability, tilt table) to quantify dysautonomia per International Federation of Autonomic Societies 2020 criteria. 7. Differential diagnosis includes Isaac\u2019s syndrome (central features absent), stiff-person syndrome (anti-GAD positive, no neuromyotonia), and motor neuron disease (EMG fibrillations vs doublets), distinguished by antibody profiles and imaging. 8. Repeat antibody testing in 4\u20136 weeks if initial negative and high clinical suspicion, per AAN 2023 follow-up protocol.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): 1) Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days to neutralize autoantibodies (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). 2) High-dose corticosteroids: methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 5 days, then oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day taper over 6 months (per EFNS/ENS 2020 consensus). 3) Plasma exchange: five exchanges over 10 days (40\u201360 mL/kg/exchange) in severe cases (per American Society for Apheresis 2021 guidelines). Tier 2 (Second-line): 1) Rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74 to deplete B cells (per ECTRIMS 2022 recommendations). 2) Azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day orally as steroid-sparing agent (per AAN 2021 guidelines). Tier 3 (Third-line): 1) Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV monthly \u00d76 for refractory disease (per NCCN 2023 guidelines). 2) Mycophenolate mofetil 1 g BID orally (per EFNS/ENS 2020). For symptomatic control: carbamazepine 200 mg BID, titrate to 800 mg/day (per International League Against Epilepsy 2021 criteria). Monitor CBC, LFTs, immunoglobulin levels, and B-cell counts monthly. In pregnancy, use IVIG and steroids only (no rituximab or cyclophosphamide) per AAN Pregnancy Advisory 2023. Adjust doses in renal impairment (reduce azathioprine by 50%).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow up every 4 weeks initially, then every 3 months once stable. Monitor clinical signs: mRS score target \u22642, frequency of neuromyotonic discharges <5/day. Laboratory surveillance: monthly CBC, LFTs, IgG levels, and annual anti-CASPR2 titers. Chest imaging (CT or MRI) annually for 2 years to detect delayed thymoma (incidence 5% at 1 year, 10% at 5 years). Neuropsychological assessment at 6 and 12 months for cognitive rehabilitation needs. Prognosis: 1-year remission rate ~60%, 5-year survival ~80% with treatment. Advise physical therapy for gait and strength, occupational therapy for daily living skills. Educate on medication adherence, infection signs, and autonomic crisis prevention. Driving clearance if no syncope or seizures for 6 months. Refer to patient support groups (e.g., PNS Foundation) and counseling services. Document quality-of-life metrics biannually with validated scales (SF-36).","clinical_pearls":"1. Morvan\u2019s syndrome triad: neuromyotonia + encephalopathy + autonomic dysfunction. 2. Anti-CASPR2 antibodies positive in ~75%; anti-LGI1 in 15%. 3.

Adolescent obesity. Cohort studies (Munger et al. 2009; Hedstr\u00f6m et al. 2016) demonstrate that obesity during adolescence (BMI \u226595th percentile) confers an odds ratio of approximately 3.6 for subsequent MS, likely mediated by proinflammatory adipokines.

McDonald 2017 criteria for primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) require at least one year of continuous clinical progression plus two of the following: dissemination in space on MRI (one cortical/juxtacortical lesion qualifies), presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands (OCB), or dissemination in space by T2 lesions in other CNS regions. In Option D, the patient has one year of progression, a cortical hyperintense lesion, and positive OCB, satisfying criteria. Option A (2 months of progression) fails the minimum one-year requirement. Option B (progression over one year without MRI or CSF evidence) lacks supportive paraclinical evidence. Option C has one year of symptoms and MRI lesion but negative OCB, so only one supportive criterion is met. No other options fulfill the two required paraclinical criteria.","conceptual_foundation":"Primary progressive MS is characterized by steady accrual of disability from onset, in contrast to relapsing\u2013remitting MS. In ICD-11, it is classified under multiple sclerosis (8A40.0). PPMS accounts for roughly 10\u201315% of MS presentations. Historically, diagnostic criteria evolved from Poser (1983) to McDonald (2001, 2005, 2010, 2017), increasingly incorporating MRI and CSF markers to allow earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from the ventral neuroepithelium of the neural tube, and demyelination in MS reflects autoimmune attack on CNS myelin. Cortical (juxtacortical) lesions are detected on T2-FLAIR sequences; OCB reflect intrathecal IgG synthesis. Relevant neuroanatomy includes periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord regions, with lesions in at least two regions indicating dissemination in space. HLA-DRB1*15:01 is the strongest genetic risk factor.","pathophysiology":"Normal myelination by oligodendrocytes facilitates saltatory conduction. In PPMS, a smoldering inflammatory process with microglial activation, complement deposition, and low\u2010grade lymphocytic infiltration leads to chronic demyelination and axonal loss. Loss of myelin decreases conduction velocity and eventually conduction block. The pathogenesis involves a predisposed genetic background (e.g., HLA alleles), environmental triggers (vitamin D deficiency, EBV), molecular mimicry, and B\u2010cell tertiary lymphoid structures in the meninges. CSF OCB reflect clonally expanded B cells producing IgG. Chronic axonal damage leads to irreversible disability. This differs from RRMS by the predominance of neurodegeneration over discrete focal inflammation.","clinical_manifestation":"PPMS presents with insidious progression of neurologic deficits without relapses. Onset is typically in the 40s. Common initial features include progressive gait dysfunction due to pyramidal tract involvement, spasticity, and less commonly sensory or cerebellar signs. Ocular or brainstem symptoms are less frequent. Progression is typically linear, with EDSS increasing by ~0.5\u20131.0 per year. CSF OCBs are present in ~85%. MRI shows fewer T2 lesions but more spinal cord involvement. Diagnostic sensitivity of McDonald 2017 for PPMS is ~85%, specificity ~95%. Without treatment, median time to EDSS 6.0 is ~12 years.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic approach begins with clinical confirmation of one year continuous progression, then MRI brain and spinal cord with T2 and FLAIR sequences. Look for dissemination in space: periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal cord lesions. CSF analysis for OCB and IgG index is second\u2010tier. Evoked potentials (visual, somatosensory) can provide third\u2010tier support if diagnostic uncertainty remains. McDonald 2017 criteria: \u22651 year progression plus 2 of 3 (DIS on MRI, positive OCB, \u22652 spinal cord lesions). Pre\u2010test probability in patients >40 with insidious spastic gait is ~70%; positive MRI and OCB raise post\u2010test to >95%.","management_principles":"There is one FDA\u2010approved therapy for PPMS: ocrelizumab, a B\u2010cell depleting anti-CD20 antibody. Ocrelizumab showed a 24% reduction in disability progression at 12 weeks vs placebo (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.59\u20130.98; p=0.03) in OPERA trials. Other immunomodulators (e.g., interferon beta, glatiramer acetate) are not effective in PPMS. Symptomatic management includes spasticity control (baclofen, tizanidine), physical therapy, and assistive devices. Ocrelizumab dosing: 600 mg IV every 24 weeks after two 300 mg loading doses. Monitoring includes CBC and immunoglobulins before each infusion.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 6-month intervals include clinical examination (EDSS), MRI brain/spine annually for the first two years, then every 2\u20133 years or if clinical worsening.

Functional assessments (Timed 25-Foot Walk) and patient\u2010reported outcome measures at each visit.
