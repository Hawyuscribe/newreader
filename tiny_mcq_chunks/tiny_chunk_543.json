What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)","Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis","Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis","Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) ## Page 2"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is definitively correct. Natalizumab increases PML risk to approximately 4.2 per 1,000 treated patients over 24 months (Clifford et al. Neurology 2012). Cognitive impairment and dysarthria evolving progressively over 2 months in a patient with prior interferon therapy and new natalizumab exposure strongly fit JCV\u2010mediated oligodendrocyte lysis. MRI typically shows multiple, nonenhancing T2/FLAIR white matter lesions without mass effect. CSF JCV PCR sensitivity is about 75% and specificity 95%. Common misconceptions include attributing any new neurologic deficit in MS to disease progression, but PML lesions lack active contrast enhancement and often occur in parietal or occipital lobes. Option B: Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is characterized by discrete attacks lasting days to weeks, with full or partial recovery. Recurrences typically occur every 6\u201312 months, not as continuous cognitive decline. Steroid responsive MRI lesions show active gadolinium enhancement. Option C: Secondary progressive MS evolves over years after RRMS, with gradual accumulation of disability rather than subacute cognitive decline and dysarthria in a 2\u2010month window. Brain atrophy predominates rather than focal white matter destruction. Option D: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is usually monophasic, follows infection or vaccination, and occurs predominantly in children. Lesions are diffuse, often symmetric, and resolve over weeks with high\u2010dose steroids. None match the subacute presentation in a natalizumab\u2010treated adult.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) arises from JC virus reactivation within CNS oligodendrocytes. Primary infection with JCV occurs in childhood; virus remains latent in kidney and lymphoid tissue. Natalizumab, an \u03b14\u2010integrin antagonist, blocks immune surveillance by preventing lymphocyte trafficking across the blood\u2013brain barrier. Key anatomical regions affected include periventricular and subcortical white matter, corpus callosum, U\u2010fibers, and cerebellar peduncles. Histologically, infected oligodendrocytes exhibit nuclear inclusions, myelin sheaths are disrupted, and axonal spheroids appear. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from ventral neural tube precursors migrating throughout the CNS. Normally, perivascular macrophages and CD8+ T-cells maintain viral latency via interferon\u2010\u03b3 and perforin\u2010mediated clearance. Similar demyelinating conditions include MS, ADEM, and central pontine myelinolysis; PML lesions are distinguished by lack of inflammation on histology. The first description of PML occurred in 1958 in a patient with hematologic malignancy. Subsequent reports in HIV/AIDS during the 1980s and natalizumab\u2010associated PML in 2005 expanded understanding. Clinically significant landmarks include the perivascular spaces of Virchow\u2013Robin and the absence of mass effect differentiating PML from neoplastic or ischemic lesions. Recognition of these structures guides radiologic interpretation and stereotactic biopsy planning.","pathophysiology":"JC virus is a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA polyomavirus that infects oligodendrocytes via 5-HT2A receptors and \u03b14\u03b21 integrins. Following natalizumab therapy, \u03b14 integrin blockade impairs lymphocyte adhesion to VCAM-1 on cerebrovascular endothelium, diminishing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell CNS trafficking by over 90% within weeks. Loss of immunosurveillance permits JCV reactivation and lytic infection. Viral large T antigen disrupts p53 and Rb pathways, causing uncontrolled viral replication. Oligodendrocyte apoptosis follows caspase-3 activation. The inflammatory response is minimal, so lesions are nonenhancing on MRI. Genetic factors such as HLA-DRB1*15 and polymorphisms in the JCV regulatory region influence susceptibility. Inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are downregulated locally, further reducing antiviral immunity. Metabolic demand of demyelinated axons increases ATP consumption by 30\u201340%, leading to axonal spheroids and secondary neurodegeneration. Time course: subclinical reactivation within 3\u20136 months of natalizumab initiation, symptomatic progression over 4\u201312 weeks. Compensatory microglial activation occurs but fails to clear JCV. The absence of oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation exacerbates demyelination. Without restoration of immune function, lesions expand at an average rate of 1.5 cm/month.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is insidious, with cognitive decline starting as mild memory lapses and executive dysfunction over 4\u20136 weeks. Dysarthria often appears next, followed by ataxia or hemiparesis. In adults aged 30\u201360, presentation peaks at a mean age of 45. In pediatric cases (rare, <5%), symptoms progress more rapidly. Elderly patients may display confusion, visual deficits, or aphasia. Full neurological exam reveals dysmetria, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses (60% of cases), and pseudobulbar affect in 25%. Severity scales like the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) show a mean increase of 2.0 points by peak. Red flags differentiating PML from MS relapse include absence of new gadolinium enhancement (<5% of lesions), rapid progression despite steroids, and poor steroid response. Systemic signs are typically absent, but subtle fever or mild leukopenia (<4.0\u00d710^9 cells/L) may occur. Without treatment, median survival is 8\u201316 weeks. Natural history without immune reconstitution shows relentless neurologic decline, with 90% of patients disabled within 3 months and 1-year mortality up to 50\u201375%. Rare rebound inflammatory PML-IRIS may temporarily worsen symptoms after natalizumab withdrawal.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion in any natalizumab\u2010treated MS patient with new focal deficits. Step 2: Brain MRI with T2/FLAIR, T1 without and with gadolinium, and diffusion\u2010weighted imaging. PML lesions are hyperintense on T2, hypointense on T1, nonenhancing in 90%, and show no restricted diffusion. Sensitivity of MRI is approximately 96%, specificity 89%. Step 3: CSF analysis for JCV DNA by quantitative PCR; sensitivity 75\u201380%, specificity 95\u201398%. Normal CSF profile (protein 15\u201345 mg/dL, cell count <5 cells/mm\u00b3) with positive JCV PCR confirms PML. If PCR negative but high suspicion, repeat in 2\u20134 weeks or consider brain biopsy. Step 4: Consider stereotactic biopsy if non\u2010diagnostic. Histology shows enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with viral inclusions and demyelinated plaques. Step 5: Exclude differential diagnoses: MS relapse (contrast enhancement, oligoclonal bands stable), CNS lymphoma (mass effect, restricted diffusion), ADEM (monophasic, young age), and viral encephalitis (fever, pleocytosis). Evoked potentials or OCT are not diagnostic for PML. Monitor JCV index (>1.5 indicates high risk). Use flowchart: suspect \u2192 MRI \u2192 CSF PCR \u2192 biopsy if needed.","management_principles":"Primary intervention is cessation of natalizumab. Initiate plasma exchange (PLEX) or immunoadsorption: 5 sessions over 7\u201310 days to remove natalizumab, achieving >80% reduction in serum concentration. Begin off\u2010label mirtazapine 30\u201345 mg PO daily to block 5-HT2A receptors and inhibit JCV entry. Consider cidofovir 5 mg/kg IV weekly for 2 weeks (nephrotoxic; monitor creatinine, adjust dose for CrCl <60 mL/min). Maraviroc 300 mg BID has been used to modulate CCR5+ lymphocytes in PML\u2010IRIS. High\u2010dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1,000 mg IV daily for 3\u20135 days) only if PML\u2010IRIS occurs, defined by contrast enhancement and clinical worsening. Avoid prophylactic corticosteroids initially to prevent immune suppression. Supportive care includes rehabilitation: 30\u201360 minutes of PT/OT thrice weekly. Monitor for IRIS: occurs in 15\u201325% of cases within 2\u20138 weeks after immune reconstitution. For JCV\u2010negative patients considering switching DMT, use fingolimod 0.5 mg PO daily or dimethyl fumarate 240 mg BID with monthly lymphocyte counts. In pregnancy, PLEX and mirtazapine are category C; discuss risks. Adjust cidofovir in renal impairment. Screen for hepatitis B/C before any second\u2010line antiviral therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"After PLEX completion, clinical follow\u2010up every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, then monthly until 1 year. Neurological exam assessing EDSS, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and speech pathology scores. Repeat brain MRI at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks to monitor lesion evolution and IRIS. CSF JCV PCR may be repeated at 3-month intervals until negative. Laboratory monitoring: complete blood count, liver and renal function tests monthly for 6 months. Monitor for long-term complications such as IRIS (incidence 20%), secondary infections (10%), and seizures (5%). Prognosis: 1-year survival improved from 25% to 50% with early PLEX and mirtazapine. Rehabilitation timeline: initiate PT/OT within 2 weeks, speech therapy within 4 weeks, with reassessment at 3-month intervals. Patient education should include JCV risk factors, symptom reporting, and DMT alternatives. Driving clearance can resume if EDSS \u22646.0 and no new cognitive deficits for 6 months.

Option B (Viral encephalitis) typically shows broader cortical and brainstem involvement and CSF pleocytosis with viral PCR positivity. Option C (Autoimmune encephalitis) is a broad category that includes both paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic causes; limbic presentations are most commonly paraneoplastic.","conceptual_foundation":"Limbic encephalitis is an immune-mediated inflammation of the medial temporal lobes, characterized by subacute memory impairment, seizures, and psychiatric disturbances.

In rare infusion-related reactions without hypotension or respiratory compromise (grade 1\u20132), slowing the infusion and premedicating with antihistamines might be reasonable in trials, but true anaphylaxis (urticaria, bronchospasm, shock) mandates drug cessation. Studies show a 4.5% incidence of infusion reactions, but only 0.6% progress to anaphylaxis. Persisting with natalizumab risks fatal recurrence and anti-drug antibody formation.\n\nOption B \u2013 Discontinue treatment: This is correct. Guidelines from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019) and manufacturer prescribing information mandate permanent discontinuation of natalizumab after anaphylaxis. Pathophysiologically, an IgE-mediated response against murine epitopes leads to mast cell degranulation within minutes, releasing histamine, tryptase, leukotrienes, and causing multi-organ shock. Discontinuation prevents re-exposure and stops antibody class switching that could worsen future exposures.\n\nOption C \u2013 Decrease the rate: Slowing the infusion rate may mitigate mild infusion reactions (pruritus, fever), seen in about 10% of patients, but does not address systemic mast cell activation in anaphylaxis. Data show that rate reduction alone fails to prevent biphasic reactions or cardiovascular collapse. It is insufficient when hypotension or airway compromise develops and delaying drug removal can exacerbate morbidity.\n\nOption D \u2013 Not applicable: There is no fourth option. Sometimes clinicians propose switching to subcutaneous or alternative antibody dosing to avoid reactions, but no evidence supports a safe rechallenge or alternate delivery after anaphylaxis. Any attempt at re-exposure risks severe recurrence, and no clinical trials endorse ANY desensitization protocol for natalizumab.","conceptual_foundation":"Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG4 directed against \u03b14 integrin subunits (\u03b14\u03b21, \u03b14\u03b27) on lymphocytes. By blocking VCAM-1 interactions on cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, it prevents diapedesis of encephalitogenic T cells across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Anatomically, leukocyte trafficking normally involves rolling along the brain\u2019s perivascular spaces, arrest at the subendothelial matrix in periventricular white matter tracts, and transmigration into juxtacortical and infratentorial regions, producing classic multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques. Embryologically, the neural tube formed from ectoderm sets the stage for specialized endothelial tight junctions and astrocytic foot processes, critical to BBB integrity.\n\nIn MS, perivenular inflammatory infiltrates concentrate in the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, and brainstem nuclei such as the oculomotor complex, causing demyelination. Historically, natalizumab emerged after early monoclonals like anti-CD4 and interferons, with initial Phase III AFFIRM trial (2006) demonstrating 68% reduction in annualized relapse rate and 42% reduction in five-year lesion load on T2 MRI. Key landmarks include the central vein sign and Dawson\u2019s fingers along periventricular ependyma. Clinical significance hinges on balancing potent efficacy against risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and hypersensitivity.","pathophysiology":"Anaphylaxis is a Type I hypersensitivity reaction mediated by preformed IgE bound to high-affinity Fc\u03b5RI receptors on mast cells and basophils. Upon re-exposure to antigenic epitopes in natalizumab (murine CDR segments or glycosylation patterns), cross-linking of surface IgE triggers phospholipase C activation, calcium influx, and degranulation within 1\u20135 minutes. Released mediators include histamine (vasodilation, increased vascular permeability), tryptase (tissue remodeling), prostaglandin D2 (bronchoconstriction), and platelet-activating factor (PAF) causing hypotension and bronchospasm.\n\nGenetic predisposition involves polymorphisms in IL4R, FCER1A, and HLA-DRB1*15 alleles, each contributing 10\u201315% increased risk. Complement activation through C3a and C5a further amplifies inflammation. Counter-regulatory IL-10 is overwhelmed. Energy requirements shift to anaerobic glycolysis in hypoperfused tissues, causing lactic acidosis. Within 20\u201360 minutes, endothelial gap junctions widen, fluid extravasation leads to angioedema, and pulmonary edema may ensue. Compensatory tachycardia and catecholamine release attempt to maintain perfusion, but 20%\u201330% of treated patients develop biphasic responses within 8\u201312 hours. No downstream complement inhibitors are effective post-discharge, so initial management is critical.","clinical_manifestation":"Anaphylaxis onset occurs typically within 5 minutes of natalizumab infusion, peaking by 15 minutes, though delayed reactions up to 2 hours have been reported in 3%. Initial symptoms include generalized pruritus, urticaria, angioedema of lips and eyelids, flushing, and anxiety. Progression entails laryngeal edema with stridor, bronchospasm producing wheeze and tachypnea (respiratory rate >30/min), hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg or >30% drop), and syncope. In severe cases, loss of consciousness, arrhythmias, and shock ensue.\n\nNeurological examination might reveal confusion, dizziness, or seizure-like syncope. Pediatric patients often exhibit vomiting and colicky abdominal pain, while elderly individuals present more frequently with hypotensive collapse. Women have a slightly higher incidence (55% vs 45%) of severe reactions. Associated systemic signs include tachycardia (>120 bpm), diaphoresis, and dyspnea. Severity scales such as Sampson\u2019s criteria grade reactions from I (cutaneous) to IV (cardiovascular collapse). Without prompt intervention, mortality rates approach 1%\u20132% and multi-organ failure can develop within hours.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is primarily clinical, following the NIAID/FAAN criteria: acute onset of skin/mucosal involvement plus respiratory compromise or hypotension after exposure. Step 1: Assess airway, breathing, circulation. Record time of infusion and symptom onset to confirm temporal link (median 10 minutes). Step 2: Differentiate from infusion reaction: measure serum tryptase at 1 hour (sensitivity 70%, specificity 90%) and again at 6 hours. A >2 \u03bcg/L rise over baseline confirms mast cell activation.\n\nFirst-line labs include complete blood count showing 20% neutrophilia, elevated lactate (>4 mmol/L), and normal-to-elevated eosinophils. Chest X-ray can reveal pulmonary edema. Second-line: skin prick or intradermal testing for natalizumab components only in experienced centers. MRI brain is not indicated acutely. CSF studies are not helpful in anaphylaxis. Electrophysiology (EEG) may be used if seizures occur. Differential diagnoses include vasovagal syncope (no urticaria), septic shock (fever, elevated CRP), and serum sickness (type III, delayed 7\u201310 days post infusion).","management_principles":"First-line treatment is intramuscular epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg (max 0.5 mg) into the mid-anterolateral thigh, repeat every 5\u201315 minutes as needed up to three doses. Simultaneously, discontinue natalizumab immediately and remove the infusion line. High-flow oxygen at 10\u201315 L/min, establish two large-bore IV lines, and administer normal saline 20 mL/kg boluses (up to 1\u20132 L in adults).\n\nAdjunctive medications include IV H1 antihistamines (diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg, max 50 mg) and H2 blockers (ranitidine 1 mg/kg). Nebulized albuterol (2.5 mg) for bronchospasm. Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1\u20132 mg/kg IV) reduce biphasic reactions but have onset after 4\u20136 hours. Vasopressors (norepinephrine starting at 0.05 \u03bcg/kg/min) are indicated for persistent hypotension. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are contraindications to epinephrine and complicate management.\n\nFor MS disease control after discontinuation, switch to fingolimod (0.5 mg daily) or ocrelizumab per specialist guidance. Desensitization protocols for natalizumab are not recommended. Monitor for PML risk when transitioning therapies. Document in allergy record and provide epinephrine auto-injector (0.3 mg) on discharge.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require close observation for 4\u20136 hours post-reaction for biphasic anaphylaxis.

Follow up with an allergist within 2\u20134 weeks for comprehensive evaluation and potential skin testing.\n\nLong-term surveillance includes prescribing two epinephrine auto-injectors, patient and caregiver education on administration technique, and reviewing avoidance strategies. Prognosis after a single severe event carries a 10%\u201320% risk of biphasic recurrence. MS management should be re-evaluated at 1 month with MRI to detect rebound disease activity after natalizumab withdrawal. Rehabilitation referrals (physical and occupational therapy) may be needed if neurologic deficits occur from hypotensive syncope. Return to work or driving typically resumes within 7 days if recovered. Support groups (National MS Society) provide ongoing resources and counseling.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Misconception arises because cranial nerve involvement often triggers alarm, but longitudinal studies (e.g., Smith et al., 2016) show that isolated INO without other atypical features is consistent with a benign MS course in over 70% of cases. Option B: Extensive transverse myelitis (TM) spanning two or three vertebral segments may present with acute bilateral leg weakness and a sensory level. While painful and severe, longitudinally extensive TM (spanning \u22653 segments) more often indicates neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) in about 80% of cases. However, limited transverse involvement still occurs in MS, so it is not universally a red flag. Option D: Complete gaze palsy\u2014both horizontal and vertical eye movements fixed\u2014is classically indicative of brainstem infarction, mass lesion, or progressive supranuclear palsy rather than MS. A 55-year-old with abrupt gaze palsy and headache would raise suspicion for tumor or stroke. However, its absence of optic nerve or spinal cord findings can mislead some into overcalling MS. Option C is definitively correct: any lesion that continues to enhance with gadolinium on MRI beyond 3 months contradicts the normal resolution timeframe of acute inflammatory plaques, which typically reduce enhancement over 4\u20138 weeks. Persistent enhancement beyond 12 weeks portends ongoing blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown in less than 1% of bona fide MS lesions, making it a true red flag for alternate diagnoses like sarcoidosis, lymphoma, or vasculitis (Paty and Ebers, 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"An understanding of central nervous system anatomy is essential when evaluating multiple sclerosis. Demyelinating lesions primarily involve white matter tracts of the brain and spinal cord. Key brain regions include periventricular areas surrounding the lateral ventricles, deep white matter of the centrum semiovale, corpus callosum, optic nerves, brainstem tracts\u2014particularly the medial longitudinal fasciculus\u2014and cerebellar peduncles. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from neuroepithelial precursors in the ventricular zone around gestational weeks 10\u201312 and migrate into the developing white matter. Their role is to myelinate axons via production of myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP); normal conduction velocity in myelinated fibers is up to 50 meters per second. Related conditions include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which often follows infection or vaccination, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, which target aquaporin-4 channels. Historically, Charcot first described multiple sclerosis in the late 19th century, noting \u2018\u2018plaques\u2019\u2019 in periventricular tissue on autopsy. Over the following decades, refined histopathological and imaging studies revealed new anatomical landmarks of demyelination and remyelination. The perivenular distribution of lesions, named \u2018\u2018Dawson\u2019s fingers,\u2019\u2019 underscores the clinical significance of the periventricular venous anatomy for lesion localization and guides interpretation of FLAIR and T2-weighted MRI sequences.","pathophysiology":"Multiple sclerosis is characterized by immune-mediated destruction of central nervous system myelin and oligodendrocytes. At the molecular level, autoreactive CD4+ T helper 1 and 17 cells recognize myelin antigens such as MBP, PLP and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). They cross the blood\u2013brain barrier via interactions with endothelial adhesion molecules\u2014VCAM-1 binding to integrin \u03b14\u03b21\u2014and secrete inflammatory cytokines including interferon-gamma, interleukin-17, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. B cells contribute by producing oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands detectable in cerebrospinal fluid in over 90% of patients. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DRB1*15:01, which increases relative risk by approximately 3-fold; polymorphisms in IL-2RA and IL-7RA also modulate susceptibility. Demyelinated axons suffer sodium channel redistribution and impaired saltatory conduction, leading to conduction block. Over time, mitochondrial dysfunction and excitotoxicity mediated by glutamate degrade axonal integrity. Chronic demyelination triggers remyelination by oligodendrocyte precursor cells via PDGF and CXCL12 signaling but is often incomplete, resulting in axonal transection and gliosis. Energy demands in demyelinated segments rise by up to 200%, overwhelming metabolic capacity. The time course evolves from early inflammatory lesions over weeks, through smoldering chronic plaques over months, to progressive neurodegeneration and atrophy detectable by volumetric MRI over years. Compensatory remyelination partially restores conduction but declines with age and lesion chronicity.","clinical_manifestation":"The symptomatic onset of multiple sclerosis varies from subacute to acute over days to weeks. A typical timeline begins with initial sensory disturbances\u2014paresthesia or numbness\u2014in one limb, progressing over days to Lhermitte\u2019s sign in about 15% of patients. Motor weakness follows in approximately 40% when corticospinal tracts are involved, with spasticity rated on the Modified Ashworth Scale (0\u20134) often between grades 1+ and 3. Visual involvement appears as optic neuritis in up to 25%, presenting with painful eye movements, reduced acuity to 20/200, and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Brainstem syndromes\u2014internuclear ophthalmoplegia or facial numbness\u2014arise in 10\u201320%. Cerebellar symptoms such as ataxia and dysarthria occur in roughly 15%. In pediatric-onset MS, cognitive deficits and ataxia are more frequent, whereas elderly patients more often display progressive motor decline. Women are affected at a female-to-male ratio of nearly 3:1, and pregnancy reduces relapse rates by about 70% in the third trimester. Systemic manifestations include fatigue in over 80%, depression in 50%, and urinary dysfunction classified by the American Urological Association symptom score. Without treatment, the average time to conversion from relapsing\u2013remitting to secondary progressive MS is approximately 19 years. Red flags include fever, acute encephalopathy, or bilateral severe optic neuritis\u2014each suggesting alternative diagnoses.","diagnostic_approach":"The workup begins with a thorough history and neurological exam. First-line MRI brain and cervical spine with and without gadolinium are ordered (sensitivity ~94%, specificity ~72%). Protocol includes T2-FLAIR, T1 pre- and post-contrast, and diffusion sequences. Diagnostic criteria\u20142017 McDonald criteria\u2014require dissemination in space (\u22652 of periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal cord) and time (new T2 or gadolinium-enhancing lesions on subsequent MRI or \u22651 relapse post initial scan). If MRI is equivocal, cerebrospinal fluid analysis follows: oligoclonal bands in 85\u201395%, IgG index >0.7 (normal 0.3\u20130.7), cell count <50 cells/\u00b5L (lymphocytic predominance), protein 0.15\u20130.45 g/L. Visual evoked potentials (VEP) reveal prolonged P-100 latency >115 ms in 60\u201380%. When atypical features appear\u2014such as mass-like lesions or persistent enhancement\u2014additional tests are ordered: ANA, ANCA, ACE levels, anti\u2013AQP4, anti\u2010MOG antibodies, and whole\u2010body PET if lymphoma is suspected. Differential diagnoses include ADEM, NMOSD, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, leukodystrophies, and Lyme disease, each distinguished by serology, MRI pattern, or biopsy. High\u2010resolution spinal imaging helps differentiate neuromyelitis optica if LETM is present.","management_principles":"Acute relapse management involves high-dose corticosteroids: methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3\u20135 days, followed by an optional oral prednisone taper of 1 mg/kg over 10\u201314 days. First-line disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) include interferon-beta-1a (Avonex) at 30 \u00b5g IM weekly or interferon-beta-1b (Betaseron) at 250 \u00b5g SC every other day. Glatiramer acetate 20 mg SC daily is an alternative. Fingolimod (Gilenya), a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator at 0.5 mg PO daily, is reserved for inadequate responders. Teriflunomide 14 mg PO daily and dimethyl fumarate 240 mg PO twice daily are other first-line oral options. Second-line therapies include natalizumab 300 mg IV every 4 weeks for JCV-negative patients and alemtuzumab 12 mg IV daily for 5 consecutive days for high\u2010activity disease. Ocrelizumab 600 mg IV every 6 months is approved for primary progressive MS. Combination therapy remains investigational. Nonpharmacological measures include physical therapy emphasizing aerobic exercise 30 minutes thrice weekly, occupational therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy for fatigue. Spasticity is treated with baclofen starting at 5 mg PO TID, titrated to 80 mg/day, or tizanidine 2 mg PO TID up to 36 mg/day. Urinary urgency responds to oxybutynin 5 mg PO TID. Surgical options such as intrathecal baclofen pumps are considered for refractory spasticity with success rates of 70\u201380%. Monitoring parameters: complete blood count and liver function tests every 3 months for interferon and teriflunomide; JCV index every 6 months for natalizumab patients.","follow_up_guidelines":"After initiating DMT, follow-up appointments occur at 3 months, 6 months, and then every 6 months thereafter. Clinical monitoring includes Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) assessment; target change <0.5 points per year. MRI surveillance with brain and spinal sequences is recommended at 12 months post\u2010therapy start and annually thereafter to evaluate new or enhancing lesions. Laboratory surveillance includes complete blood count, liver enzymes, and renal function every 3\u20136 months depending on the agent. Long-term complications such as secondary progressive conversion occur in 50% by 15 years; vigilance for cognitive decline is essential. Prognosis: 80% remain ambulatory at 10 years with DMT, and 60% at 20 years. Rehabilitation, including gait training and assistive devices, should begin within the first 6 months of diagnosis. Patient education covers avoidance of heat exposure and infection risk mitigation. Return to work is often feasible within three months for relapsing\u2013remitting patients. Driving clearance requires stable EDSS <6.0 and no relapse in the past 3 months. Resources include the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and MS International Federation for support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Gadolinium enhancement typically resolves by 4\u20138 weeks; persistence >12 weeks is a red flag for alternative pathology. 2. \u2018\u2018Dawson\u2019s fingers\u2019\u2019 refer to periventricular lesions oriented perpendicular to ventricles on FLAIR MRI. 3. Oligoclonal bands in CSF but absent in serum support intrathecal IgG synthesis in >90% of MS patients. 4. Natalizumab requires JCV antibody index monitoring; index >1.5 increases PML risk by approximately 1:100 after two years. 5. Fingolimod first-dose cardiac monitoring for six hours is mandatory due to bradycardia risk. 6. Pregnancy reduces relapse rate by ~70% in third trimester; postpartum relapse risk rises by ~30%. 7. Primary progressive MS affects 10\u201315% of patients; ocrelizumab is the only FDA-approved therapy. These pearls highlight common pitfalls, emphasize safety monitoring, and reflect guideline updates from the past five years.","references":"1.
