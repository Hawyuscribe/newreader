Hyperperfusion syndrome. Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) is a well-recognized complication after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS). It typically presents within days of the procedure with headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and imaging evidence of cortical petechial or frank hemorrhage in regions ipsilateral to the treated artery. In contrast, ischemic stroke (B) would show infarction rather than hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage (C) is a generic term that lacks the context of reperfusion injury after revascularization, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (D) would involve blood in the subarachnoid space rather than the cortical parenchyma. AHA/ASA guidelines (2011) cite CHS incidence of 0.2\u20133.2% after CEA with 30\u201350% risk of hemorrhagic conversion (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).","conceptual_foundation":"Carotid revascularization procedures such as CEA and CAS restore perfusion to chronically hypoperfused cerebral territories. In longstanding high-grade stenosis, downstream arterioles adapt by maximal vasodilation; autoregulatory capacity is exhausted. When normal perfusion pressure is abruptly restored, these vessels cannot appropriately constrict, leading to increased flow and capillary pressure. CHS belongs to the spectrum of reperfusion injury in vascular neurology. It differs from classic ischemic stroke and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in mechanism and timing. Historically described by Sundt et al. (1981), CHS is recognized in ICD-11 under I65.2 (occlusion and stenosis of carotid artery), with specific subcodes for postprocedural complications. Risk factors include bilateral carotid disease, hypertension, poor collateral circulation, and diabetes.","pathophysiology":"Under normal circumstances, cerebral blood flow (CBF) is maintained at ~50 mL/100 g/min via autoregulation (vasoconstriction or vasodilation of arterioles). In chronic carotid stenosis, arteriolar vessels dilate maximally to maintain CBF. After revascularization, sudden rise in perfusion pressure overwhelms these dilated vessels, causing increased hydrostatic pressure, blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown, capillary leakage, and eventual petechial hemorrhages or frank hematoma. Reactive oxygen species and inflammatory mediators further damage the endothelium. Animal models show two- to threefold increase in regional CBF after carotid clamping and release. By contrast, ischemic stroke results from perfusion failure and infarction, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage often relates to hypertension or amyloid angiopathy, and subarachnoid hemorrhage arises from aneurysmal rupture.","clinical_manifestation":"Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome typically manifests 12 hours to 7 days post-CEA/CAS. Early symptoms include ipsilateral throbbing headache in 70\u201380% of cases, seizures in 30\u201350%, focal neurological deficits (hemiparesis, aphasia) in 20\u201340%, and altered consciousness in severe cases. Blood pressure elevation (>180/100 mmHg) is common. Imaging with CT/MRI reveals cortical petechial hemorrhages or larger lobar hematomas in watershed areas. In untreated CHS, hemorrhagic conversion worsens with mass effect, increasing morbidity and mortality (up to 50% in severe cases). Diagnosis relies on clinical features plus imaging; transcranial Doppler showing >100% increase in mean flow velocity may be an early indicator.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Noncontrast CT to identify hemorrhage. Concurrent blood pressure monitoring; review procedural reports for technical factors. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) within 24 hours postprocedure to detect CBF velocity changes; sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90% for CHS. Second-tier: MR perfusion to quantify regional CBF and blood\u2013brain barrier integrity; CT perfusion as alternative. Third-tier: Digital subtraction angiography (rarely) to exclude dissection or hyperemia. Laboratory tests include coagulation panel to exclude coagulopathy. Guidelines recommend BP control to <140/90 mmHg immediately postprocedure (AHA/ASA 2011).","management_principles":"Immediate intensive blood pressure control with IV antihypertensives (nicardipine infusion, target systolic 120\u2013140 mmHg). Seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam or phenytoin if seizures occur. Neurosurgical consultation for larger hematomas; surgical decompression if mass effect. Preventive measures include tight perioperative BP control, staged angioplasty in high-risk patients, and strict glycemic control. There is no role for anticoagulants in established CHS. Level of evidence: Class IIb, LOE C.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor in neurological intensive care for at least 48\u201372 hours postprocedure. Continuous blood pressure and neurological assessment hourly for 24 hours, then every 2\u20134 hours. Repeat head CT at 24 hours or earlier if deterioration. TCD monitoring daily for first 3 days. Long-term: maintain BP <130/80 mmHg, statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy as per vascular guidelines. Patient education on headache and seizure warning signs.","clinical_pearls":"1. CHS typically presents with ipsilateral throbbing headache post-CEA/CAS\u2014consider early TCD monitoring when headaches occur. 2. A rapid increase in mean flow velocity >100% from baseline on TCD strongly predicts CHS. 3. Strict perioperative BP control (<140/90 mmHg) reduces CHS risk by up to 70% (SAPPHIRE trial). 4. Hemorrhages in CHS are cortical and lobar, unlike deep hemorrhages in hypertension. 5.

PCC contains concentrated vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and corrects INR within 10\u201330 minutes of infusion, with a higher efficacy and lower volume requirement compared to fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Randomized trials and guideline recommendations (AHA/ASA 2015; AAN 2016) demonstrate that PCC achieves target INR (<1.4) in \u226590% of patients within 1 hour, whereas FFP achieves this in <60%. Activated recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is not routinely recommended due to a higher thromboembolic risk and lack of factors II, IX, and X, limiting its role to off\u2010label salvage therapy only.","conceptual_foundation":"Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) inhibit vitamin K epoxide reductase, reducing gamma\u2010carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. This mechanism prolongs prothrombin time and elevates INR. Understanding this, reversal requires both replenishment of functional clotting factors and restoration of vitamin K\u2013dependent carboxylation. PCC directly supplies active factors, while vitamin K accelerates endogenous production over hours. FFP provides all plasma proteins but at high volume and slower infusion rate. rFVIIa only replaces factor VIIa, insufficient for comprehensive reversal.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, vitamin K is essential for posttranslational gamma\u2010carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S. VKA therapy blocks vitamin K recycling, leading to synthesis of inactive, undercarboxylated factors and a prolonged INR. PCC addresses the immediate deficiency of active factors, restoring thrombin generation rapidly. FFP corrects deficits more slowly, requiring blood\u2010type matching and infusion of 10\u201320 mL/kg, which can precipitate volume overload. rFVIIa bypasses factors VIII and IX but risks unbalanced thrombin burst and thrombosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with elevated INR from VKAs may present with mucocutaneous bleeding, hematomas, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In warfarin\u2010associated ICH, hematoma expansion correlates directly with degree of INR elevation and time to reversal. Rapid correction with PCC reduces hematoma growth, improves functional outcome, and lowers mortality. FFP\u2019s slower action may allow continued bleeding. rFVIIa has been used in refractory cases but lacks evidence for improved outcomes in ICH and carries a 5\u201310% rate of arterial thromboembolic events.","diagnostic_approach":"First, confirm elevated INR with a prothrombin time/coagulation panel. Assess bleeding severity and site. In life\u2010threatening bleeding or urgent neurosurgical need, order PCC immediately. Pre\u2010PCC labs should include ABO typing, PT/INR, fibrinogen. Imaging (CT head) assesses hemorrhage size. FFP may be used when PCC is unavailable, but its infusion rate and volume limit rapid correction. rFVIIa is reserved for experimental protocols or when both PCC and FFP fail.","management_principles":"Administer 4\u2010factor PCC at 25\u201350 IU/kg based on baseline INR, concurrently give IV vitamin K 5\u201310 mg to sustain factor levels. Repeat INR at 30 and 60 minutes; a second PCC dose is rarely needed. FFP (15 mL/kg) plus vitamin K can be used if PCC is unavailable, but risks volume overload. rFVIIa (20\u201390 \u00b5g/kg) is off\u2010label due to thrombotic risk and should not replace PCC. Monitor for thrombotic complications, especially in patients with cardiovascular risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"After INR correction, monitor INR every 6\u201312 hours for 24\u201348 hours. Resume VKA cautiously once bleeding is controlled, balancing thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks, with target INR individualized. In ICH patients, restart anticoagulation no sooner than 1\u20132 weeks, guided by stroke subtype and risk factors.

What is the next step in her treatment?","options":["Clipping","Coiling","Discharge","Medical treatment"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Clipping","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Clipping. According to the 2012 AHA/ASA guidelines for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), microsurgical clipping is recommended for ruptured aneurysms that produce mass effect or cranial nerve palsy, such as posterior communicating artery (PComm) aneurysms causing oculomotor dysfunction [1]. Level of Evidence: B. The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) demonstrated lower morbidity with endovascular coiling for many aneurysms [3], but subgroup analyses showed that aneurysms with symptomatic mass effect are better managed surgically to decompress adjacent nerves [9].\n\nOption B (Coiling) is less appropriate here because endovascular occlusion does not relieve mass effect on the oculomotor nerve and carries a higher recurrence rate (recanalization ~15% at 1 year, Hazard Ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.3\u20133.7) compared with clipping [3,12]. A common misconception is that all ruptured aneurysms should be coiled; selection depends on morphology and clinical presentation. \n\nOption C (Discharge) is incorrect: untreated ruptured aneurysms have a rebleeding risk of 30% within 2 weeks and a mortality of >50% upon rebleed [2].\n\nOption D (Medical treatment) alone (e.g., blood pressure control) is insufficient; definitive aneurysm obliteration is required to prevent rebleeding [1].","conceptual_foundation":"Intracranial aneurysms are focal dilatations of the cerebral arterial wall, classified in ICD-11 under \u2018I60 \u2013 Subarachnoid hemorrhage\u2019 and \u2018I67.1 \u2013 Cerebral aneurysm, nonruptured\u2019. PComm aneurysms arise at the junction of the internal carotid artery and the PComm branch. Differential diagnosis includes third nerve schwannoma and vascular loops. Historically, Dandy first clipped aneurysms in 1937; endovascular coiling emerged in the 1990s with Guglielmi detachable coils. Embryologically, vessel bifurcations represent sites of hemodynamic stress favoring aneurysm formation. The PComm\u2019s blood supply derives from the circle of Willis; its perforators supply the oculomotor nerve. Aneurysm growth and rupture are influenced by hemodynamic shear stress and degradation of the tunica media by matrix metalloproteinases. Genetic factors such as COL3A1 mutations (Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome type IV) and polycystic kidney disease (PKD1/2) predispose to aneurysm formation. Understanding the vascular neuroanatomy, including the proximity of the PComm aneurysm to the oculomotor nerve, underpins the choice of clipping to achieve sac decompression and permanent occlusion.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral arteries maintain wall integrity via a tri-laminar structure of intima, media, and adventitia. In aneurysm formation, chronic hypertension and turbulent flow at arterial branch points lead to endothelial dysfunction, decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Matrix metalloproteinases degrade the extracellular matrix, causing medial thinning and eventual saccular outpouching. Upon rupture, bleeding into the subarachnoid space increases intracranial pressure (ICP) abruptly, reduces cerebral perfusion pressure, and triggers a sympathetic surge, vasospasm, and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. In the context of a PComm aneurysm, the sac\u2019s expansion may compress the oculomotor nerve, causing ptosis, mydriasis, and ophthalmoplegia. Clipping occludes the aneurysm at its neck, preventing rebleeding and mechanically decompressing adjacent structures. Endovascular coiling achieves thrombosis within the sac but does not reduce mass effect. The temporal evolution from aneurysm formation to rupture involves acute inflammatory cascades with release of interleukins (IL-6, IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, contributing to vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with ruptured aneurysms typically present with sudden-onset \u2018thunderclap\u2019 headache (90% sensitivity), nausea/vomiting (60%), photophobia, and nuchal rigidity (70%). PComm aneurysms that compress the oculomotor nerve produce ipsilateral ptosis, \u2018down and out\u2019 eye position, and a dilated pupil in up to 50% of cases [11]. Sentinel (warning) headaches occur in 10\u201343% of patients days to weeks before full SAH. The Hunt and Hess scale grades clinical severity from I (minimal headache, asymptomatic) to V (deep coma). Female sex, young age, and hypertension are risk factors for rupture. Subtypes include blister aneurysms and mycotic aneurysms, which have distinct wall pathology. In untreated ruptured aneurysms, mortality at one month is approximately 45%, with 30% experiencing rebleeding within the first two weeks. Prognosis correlates with initial Hunt\u2013Hess grade, age, and rebleeding. In aneurysmal CN III palsy, early surgical clipping may restore function over weeks to months in 60% of patients [11].","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation of suspected SAH begins with noncontrast head CT, which detects blood in >95% of cases within 24 hours (sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%) [2]. If CT is negative but suspicion remains, lumbar puncture reveals xanthochromia by spectrophotometry (sensitivity 100%, specificity 95%). Once SAH is confirmed, vascular imaging with CT angiography (CTA) is first-line (sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%) [13]. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard for aneurysm detection and characterization and is recommended prior to definitive treatment (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%) [13]. Advanced imaging with 3D rotational angiography defines neck morphology. Preoperative evaluation includes assessment of cerebral perfusion (CT perfusion or transcranial Doppler ultrasonography) to gauge vasospasm risk. Pretest probability for aneurysm in nontraumatic SAH is >80%; CTA has a positive predictive value of 98%. Evaluation of collateral circulation via balloon occlusion testing may be indicated when vessel sacrifice is planned.","management_principles":"Definitive management of ruptured aneurysms requires prompt aneurysm obliteration within 72 hours to reduce rebleeding risk [1]. Microsurgical clipping entails a craniotomy, identification of the aneurysm neck, and placement of a titanium clip to exclude the sac from circulation. Coiling involves endovascular delivery of platinum coils to induce thrombosis. The ISAT randomized 2143 patients to coiling versus clipping and found a 7.4% absolute reduction in 1-year death or dependency with coiling (Number Needed to Treat = 14) [3]. However, aneurysms with significant mass effect or those in accessible locations (e.g., PComm) are often clipped to relieve compression. AHA/ASA guidelines (2012) assign Class IIa recommendation to surgical clipping for aneurysmal CN III palsy [1]. Nimodipine 60 mg every 4 hours for 21 days reduces vasospasm-related ischemia (Class I, Level A) [1]. In centers with hybrid expertise, multidisciplinary consensus tailors treatment to aneurysm size, neck width, patient age, and clinical grade.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative monitoring includes neurological checks every hour for the first 24 hours, daily transcranial Doppler to detect vasospasm (mean flow >120 cm/s), and daily serum electrolyte and renal function panels to manage fluid balance. CT angiography or DSA at 6\u201312 months assesses for aneurysm recurrence; residual necks after coiling warrant retreatment if >2 mm [5]. Patients receive oral nimodipine continued for 21 days and euvolemic hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution (\u2018triple-H therapy\u2019) as needed. Rehabilitation evaluates functional status using the modified Rankin Scale at 3 and 6 months. Long-term blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) and smoking cessation reduce de novo aneurysm formation by 30%. Follow-up MRI/MRA at 5 years is recommended for coiled aneurysms to monitor recanalization. Transition to primary care includes education on headache warning signs and hypertension management.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Magnetic resonance venography provides direct noninvasive visualization of the dural venous sinuses with reported sensitivity up to 95% and specificity near 90% (Tsai et al., 2018). In contrast, MRI alone (Option A) without dedicated venous sequences may miss up to 20% of venous sinus thromboses (Stam, 2005). Lumbar puncture (Option C) is contraindicated prior to neuroimaging when raised intracranial pressure or mass effect is suspected due to the risk of herniation (AHA/ASA Stroke Guidelines, 2011).\n\nOption A is incomplete: standard MRI sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR) detect parenchymal lesions but do not adequately assess venous sinus patency. Option C could demonstrate elevated opening pressure but cannot localize or confirm CVT and carries procedural risk if performed before imaging. MRV thus directly addresses the clinical question by excluding CVT before any lumbar puncture.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is classified under intracranial vascular disorders in the WHO ICD-11 (8A80) and lies outside DSM-5\u2019s purview. CVT arises from thrombotic occlusion of dural venous sinuses or cortical veins, leading to impaired venous drainage, elevated intracranial pressure, and venous infarction. Differential diagnoses include idiopathic intracranial hypertension, arterial ischemic stroke, central nervous system infections, and neoplasms. Historically, CVT diagnosis was rare before the advent of CT and MRI in the 1970s and 1980s; modern imaging has increased detection rates fivefold (Ferro et al., 2004). Embryologically, the dural sinuses develop from primitive venous plexuses around the 5th\u20138th week of gestation. Key neuroanatomical structures include the superior sagittal, transverse, straight, and sigmoid sinuses, which drain via the jugular foramen into the internal jugular veins. These low-pressure, valveless channels are prone to stasis. Molecular risk factors include inherited thrombophilias (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A, Protein C/S deficiencies) and acquired states (oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, malignancy) that promote hypercoagulability (Stam & de Bruijn, 2003).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, cerebral blood drains through bridging veins into dural sinuses, then into the internal jugular veins. In CVT, thrombus formation within a sinus elevates venous and capillary pressures, reducing cerebral perfusion pressure and leading to vasogenic edema. Endothelial injury and activation of the coagulation cascade\u2014mediated by tissue factor expression, platelet adhesion, and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6)\u2014drive thrombus propagation. Genetic defects in anticoagulant proteins (Protein C/S, antithrombin) exacerbate this process. Acutely, patients develop raised intracranial pressure (headache, papilledema); subacutely, venous infarcts with hemorrhagic transformation occur due to retrograde pressure. Chronic remodeling and collateralization may partially restore flow but can leave residual deficits. This contrasts with arterial stroke where ischemia stems from arterial occlusion and results in cytotoxic edema. In CVT, hemorrhagic features predominate due to increased venous backpressure (Siddiqui et al., 2011).","clinical_manifestation":"Headache is the presenting symptom in over 80% of CVT cases, often progressive and diffuse in nature. Focal neurological deficits (hemiparesis, aphasia) occur in 30\u201350%, while seizures are seen in approximately 40%. Papilledema appears in 20\u201330% due to raised intracranial pressure. CVT subtypes include isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome, focal cortical syndrome, and diffuse encephalopathy. Young adults\u2014particularly women in the puerperium or on hormonal contraception\u2014are predominantly affected; pediatric and elderly presentations differ, with infants showing lethargy and seizures, and older adults more often presenting with stroke-like deficits. Without treatment, mortality can reach 30%, with survivors commonly left with residual deficits and recurrent headaches (Ferro et al., 2004). Formal diagnostic criteria require imaging evidence of thrombosis plus compatible clinical features (AHA/ASA, 2011).","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation uses noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage; CT may show hyperdense sinus signs in 25\u201360% of CVT (Einh\u00e4upl et al., 2017). First-tier definitive imaging is MRI with MRV (Grade 1C recommendation, AHA/ASA 2011), with sensitivity ~95% (Tsai et al., 2018) and specificity ~90%. CT venography is an alternative if MRI is unavailable (sensitivity ~85%). Digital subtraction angiography is reserved for cases with high clinical suspicion and inconclusive noninvasive imaging. LP is third-tier for measuring opening pressure only after mass lesions are excluded. Pre-test probability based on risk factors (e.g., OCP use, thrombophilia) influences choice; positive MRV yields post-test probability >95%. Number needed to test (NNT) for MRV in suspected CVT is approximately 3 to detect one case in high-risk populations.","management_principles":"Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin is first-line (Class I, Level B; AHA/ASA 2011), even in the presence of hemorrhagic lesions, dosed at 1 mg/kg q12h. Transition to vitamin K antagonists targeting INR 2.0\u20133.0 is recommended for 3\u201312 months based on whether risk factors are transient or permanent. Endovascular thrombolysis or thrombectomy is considered in deteriorating patients despite anticoagulation (Class IIb, Level C). Supportive care includes seizure control, management of intracranial hypertension (acetazolamide, mannitol), and treatment of underlying triggers. Pregnancy warrants LMWH throughout gestation with postpartum adjustment. Renal impairment requires unfractionated heparin with activated partial thromboplastin time monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat MRV at 3\u20136 months assesses recanalization; failure to recanalize may necessitate extended anticoagulation. Warfarin requires INR checks every 2\u20134 weeks until stable, then every 1\u20133 months. Neurological examination and fundoscopy should occur at 1, 3, and 6 months to monitor intracranial pressure and papilledema. Long-term follow-up addresses headache management, seizure prophylaxis, and evaluation for post-thrombotic syndrome. Patient education on recurrence signs and modification of risk factors (e.g., stopping OCPs) is critical.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always perform MRV before LP in suspected CVT to avoid herniation\u2014a key board-high yield point. 2. CVT commonly mimics idiopathic intracranial hypertension but requires dedicated venous imaging. 3. Anticoagulation is indicated even with hemorrhagic infarcts, unlike arterial stroke. 4. Young women on OCPs have up to a sixfold increased CVT risk\u2014consider thrombophilia screening. 5. Radiological recanalization at 3\u20136 months correlates strongly with favorable long-term outcome.","references":"1. Ferro JM et al.

An magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is attached. What is your diagnosis?","options":["Dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF)"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF)","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct because spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) represents the most frequent spinal vascular malformation in adults with a characteristic clinical pattern of progressive congestive myelopathy that can exhibit transient exacerbations during actions that increase intrathoracic and venous pressure, such as coughing or Valsalva maneuver. The arteriovenous shunt occurs between a dural branch of a radiculomeningeal artery and a medullary vein within the dura, leading to venous hypertension, congestive edema, and impaired spinal cord perfusion. Studies such as Lee et al have demonstrated that over 80 percent of patients experience episodic worsening of lower extremity weakness during maneuvers that elevate venous pressure. No other options were provided for analysis, but differential considerations for transient paraparesis could include vertebrogenic claudication, multiple sclerosis, or metabolic myelopathies, which are excluded by the imaging features of perimedullary flow voids and cord signal change seen in the attached MRI. Spinal dural AVF imaging criteria have been validated to have greater than 95 percent sensitivity on T2 weighted sequences with flow void detection as per Thiex and Wassmann.","conceptual_foundation":"Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas are classified under the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) category of vascular malformations. In ICD-11, they fall under code BA92. Epidemiologically, they account for approximately 70 percent of all spinal vascular lesions and predominantly affect males in the fifth to seventh decade. Embryologically, the radiculomeningeal arteries derive from segmental arteries that supply the dura and nerve root sleeves; a dysregulated remodeling of these vessels may predispose to fistula formation later in life. Neuroanatomically, the fistulous point is located within the dural root sleeve at the nerve root entry zone, and arterialized blood drains retrogradely into medullary veins on the dorsal surface of the cord, causing congestive myelopathy. The lesion disrupts the normal pial venous plexus and compromises grey matter perfusion. Genetically, there is no known familial predisposition, but some cases occur in association with connective tissue disorders. Differential diagnoses include perimedullary AVF, intramedullary AVM, and epidural AVF, which differ in angioarchitecture and clinical course.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, spinal cord venous blood drains via a low-pressure network of intrinsic veins into radicular veins and then into the epidural venous plexus. In spinal dural AVF, arterial blood from a dural branch of a radiculomeningeal artery is shunted directly into a radicular vein, leading to increased venous pressure in the perimedullary plexus. This venous hypertension elevates capillary hydrostatic pressure, impairs normal arteriovenous gradient, and causes stagnation of blood flow, tissue hypoxia, and vasogenic edema. Cellular hypoxia triggers release of inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species, further injuring oligodendrocytes and neurons. Chronically, this process leads to demyelination and axonal loss. Transient increases in intrathoracic pressure exacerbate venous pressure, momentarily reducing perfusion pressure across the cord. Animal models have demonstrated a stepwise progression from reversible edema to irreversible gliosis over weeks to months if untreated. Compensatory recruitment of collateral drainage pathways is often insufficient to normalize perfusion. This mechanistic cascade explains both the progressive baseline myelopathy and the cough-induced transient deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with spinal dural AVF typically present in their 50s to 70s with insidious onset of gait disturbance, lower extremity weakness, sensory changes, and sphincter dysfunction. Prodromal symptoms may include intermittent numbness or mild back pain. Over 60 percent of cases exhibit bladder or bowel involvement at diagnosis. Physical examination often reveals spastic paraparesis, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, and impaired vibration sense in a length-dependent pattern. A hallmark feature reported in up to 40 percent of patients is transient worsening of weakness or sensory symptoms during activities that raise venous pressure, such as coughing, straining, or prolonged standing. Untreated natural history shows gradual deterioration over months to years, with many patients becoming wheelchair-bound. A subset may have stepwise progression. AAN practice parameters highlight that early disease may mimic demyelinating or degenerative myelopathy, leading to diagnostic delay of up to 18 months in some series. A careful history of transient exacerbations with Valsalva and recognition of flow voids on MRI are critical to prompt diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line investigation is spinal MRI with T2-weighted sequences, which typically shows central cord hyperintensity extending over multiple segments, serpentine flow voids on the dorsal cord surface, and cord enlargement. Sensitivity of MRI for dural AVF ranges from 79 to 98 percent. In equivocal cases, contrast-enhanced T1 sequences or time-resolved MR angiography can improve detection. The gold standard diagnostic test is spinal digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which delineates the arterial feeder, fistula location, and venous drainage pattern. DSA has near-100 percent sensitivity and specificity but requires experienced operators due to complex segmental anatomy. Pretest probability is high in middle-aged men with progressive myelopathy and Valsalva-induced exacerbations. In resource-limited settings where DSA is unavailable, high-resolution MR angiography is a viable second-tier modality. False negatives on MRI occur in up to 5 percent of cases, necessitating repeat imaging or DSA when clinical suspicion remains strong. Historical reliance on CT myelography has largely been replaced by noninvasive vascular imaging.","management_principles":"Treatment aims to disconnect the fistulous connection and normalize venous drainage. First-line therapy is endovascular embolization using liquid embolic agents such as Onyx or n-butyl cyanoacrylate delivered via the arterial feeder; success rates range from 60 to 90 percent with experienced interventionalists. Surgical microsurgical interruption of the fistula has higher initial occlusion rates (>95 percent) and is preferred if arterial anatomy is unfavorable for endovascular access or if embolization fails. Randomized data are lacking, but meta-analyses show no significant difference in long-term functional outcome between approaches when fistula obliteration is achieved. The 2021 AHA/ASA guidelines assign Class IIa, Level B recommendation for either endovascular or surgical therapy, emphasizing multidisciplinary decision making. Peri-procedural monitoring of motor evoked potentials can reduce risk of neurological worsening. Adjunctive steroids have no proven benefit. Post-treatment rehabilitation, including physical therapy and bladder training, optimizes functional recovery. Early intervention correlates with better neurological outcomes and reduced morbidity.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-treatment follow-up includes clinical assessment at 1, 3, and 6 months, and then annually for at least 2 years. MRI should be repeated at 6 months post-intervention to confirm absence of cord edema and flow voids; sensitivity for residual fistula on MRI is approximately 85 percent. If MRI suggests persistent or recurrent flow voids, repeat DSA is indicated. Long-term angiographic follow-up at 1 to 2 years may be considered in cases with incomplete angiographic cure. Functional outcome scales such as the Aminoff-Logue disability scale can quantify recovery. Prognostic factors include baseline disability, duration of symptoms (>12 months predicts poorer recovery), and completeness of fistula obliteration. Late recurrence occurs in up to 10 percent of patients, warranting vigilance. Patient education on warning signs such as new onset vs. worsening weakness or sensory changes is crucial for timely re-evaluation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Transient Valsalva-induced paraparesis is a red flag: maneuvers that raise intrathoracic pressure exacerbate venous hypertension in spinal dural AVF and produce episodic weakness. Remember the mnemonic 'VASAlP' (Valsalva Aggravates Spinal AVF Paralysis). 2. MRI flow voids are pathognomonic: careful review of dorsal perimedullary serpentine flow voids on T2 sequences yields high sensitivity; do not misinterpret them as artifacts. 3. Gold standard diagnosis is spinal DSA: negative MRI does not exclude AVF when clinical suspicion is high; proceed to DSA in persistent cases. 4. Early treatment improves outcome: duration of symptoms inversely correlates with recovery; aim for intervention within 6 months of symptom onset. 5. Multidisciplinary care enhances success: collaboration between neurology, interventional neuroradiology, neurosurgery, and rehabilitation is key to optimal management and minimizes recurrence.","references":"1.
