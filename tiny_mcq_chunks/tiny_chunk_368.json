Classic presentation includes nocturnal hand numbness, paresthesia in median nerve distribution (thumb, index, middle, radial half of ring finger), and relief by shaking or flicking the hand (Phalen\u2019s and flick sign) (Padua et al. Lancet Neurol 2016). The flick sign has sensitivity ~70% and specificity ~90% (Padua et al. 2016). Option B (ulnar nerve entrapment) causes numbness in ulnar distribution (ring and small finger), often worsened by elbow flexion (Tinel\u2019s at elbow), not improved by shaking. Option C (cervical radiculopathy) produces neck pain radiating to the hand, often with motor deficits and reflex changes, and is positional (spurling\u2019s). Option D (peripheral neuropathy) is usually symmetric and distal, not focal and intermittent nocturnal. Nerve conduction studies in CTS show prolonged distal latency of median nerve (sensory latency >3.5 ms, motor latency >4.2 ms) with high sensitivity (>85%) and specificity (>90%) (AAN 2016).","conceptual_foundation":"CTS is an entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist within the carpal tunnel (ICD-11 code 8E44.0). Commonly associated with repetitive wrist flexion (typing), diabetes, hypothyroidism, pregnancy. Differential includes pronator syndrome, cervical radiculopathy, diabetic neuropathy. Historically described by Sir James Paget (1854). Embryologically, median nerve fibers derive from neural crest cells; the carpal tunnel is anatomically bounded by carpal bones and flexor retinaculum. Repetitive microtrauma and ischemia lead to endoneurial edema and fibrosis, causing conduction block.","pathophysiology":"Normal median nerve conduction requires intact myelinated fibers and adequate endoneurial blood flow. Increased pressure in the carpal tunnel (>30 mmHg during flexion) impairs venous return, causes endoneurial edema, demyelination, and eventual axonal loss. Chronic compression leads to segmental demyelination, onion bulb formation, and loss of large-diameter fibers, manifesting as sensory loss and then motor weakness (Graham et al. Muscle Nerve 2008). Cytokine-mediated fibroblast proliferation thickens perineurium, worsening compression.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report nocturnal paresthesias, pain radiating to forearm, relieved by hand shaking within seconds (flick sign). Weakness in thumb abduction/opposition may develop later. Tinel\u2019s sign (percussion at wrist) is positive in ~50%, Phalen\u2019s test (wrist flexion) positive in ~80%. Severe cases have thenar atrophy. Natural history untreated: progressive demyelination leads to irreversible axonal loss over months to years.","diagnostic_approach":"Grade sensory-motor nerve conduction studies (NCS) as first-tier: median sensory distal latency >3.5 ms (sens 85\u201390%, spec 95%); motor distal latency >4.2 ms (sens 80\u201385%, spec 90%); EMG for denervation in severe cases. Ultrasound (second-tier) shows cross-sectional area >10 mm2 at the tunnel inlet (sens 78%, spec 86%). MRI (third-tier) reserved for atypical cases or mass lesions. Pre-test probability high with nocturnal symptoms and flick sign.","management_principles":"First-line: wrist splinting at neutral position at night; NSAIDs. Local corticosteroid injection into carpal tunnel (1 mL triamcinolone 10 mg/mL) yields 60\u201370% symptom relief at 3 months (AAOS guidelines 2016). Second-line: surgical decompression (open or endoscopic) indicated for refractory or severe cases; success rate ~90% with low complication rates. Nonpharmacologic: activity modification, ergonomic adjustments.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess clinically at 6 weeks after conservative therapy; repeat NCS only if symptoms persist or worsen.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP)","Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP)","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common variant of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and typically follows an antecedent infection, such as diarrhea due to Campylobacter jejuni. The classic presentation is an acute, ascending, symmetric weakness with areflexia. Option B, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), by definition has a progressive or relapsing course over at least 8 weeks, making it inconsistent with a 10-day post\u2010diarrhea onset. Multiple studies (Asbury and Cornblath, 1990; van Doorn et al., 2008) confirm that AIDP accounts for >90% of GBS cases in Western countries. AIDP shows albuminocytologic dissociation on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and slowed nerve conduction velocities on electrodiagnostic testing, findings that CIDP would not present so acutely.","conceptual_foundation":"Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is an acute, immune\u2010mediated polyradiculoneuropathy classified under ICD-11 code 8A60.0. It encompasses several variants: AIDP, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor\u2010sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), and Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). AIDP is the demyelinating form, whereas CIDP involves chronic demyelination with relapses or progression over at least 8 weeks. Pathogenically, molecular mimicry between microbial antigens (e.g., Campylobacter lipooligosaccharide) and peripheral nerve myelin proteins triggers complement\u2010mediated demyelination. The dorsal root ganglia, spinal roots, and peripheral nerves are primarily affected, leading to slowed conduction velocity and conduction block. Related differential diagnoses include toxin\u2010mediated neuropathies, vasculitic neuropathy, and acute myelopathy.","pathophysiology":"In AIDP, host antibodies against myelin epitopes activate complement, leading to macrophage\u2010mediated stripping of myelin sheaths. Demyelination slows saltatory conduction and produces conduction block. Structural changes include segmental demyelination and onion\u2010bulb formations in chronic cases but are absent early. This contrasts with CIDP, where chronic immune attack leads to repeated demyelination/remyelination cycles and pronounced Schwann cell hyperplasia. The acute timing (<4 weeks) and monophasic course reflect the sudden immune activation post\u2010infection, whereas CIDP\u2019s pathophysiology involves a more indolent, T\u2010cell\u2013mediated component over months.","clinical_manifestation":"AIDP presents with rapidly progressive, symmetric weakness typically beginning in the legs and ascending to arms and cranial muscles over days. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished or absent. Sensory symptoms (paresthesias, numbness) are common but less prominent. Autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension) may occur. Peak weakness usually occurs by 2\u20134 weeks. CSF shows elevated protein with normal cell count (albuminocytologic dissociation) in ~80% by week 2. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies reveal prolonged distal latencies, slowed conduction velocities, and conduction block, findings not seen in pure axonal variants.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: CSF analysis and nerve conduction studies (NCS)/EMG. CSF protein >45 mg/dL with <10 cells/mm3 has sensitivity ~82% and specificity ~80% by week 2 (Doets et al., 2009). NCS evidence of demyelination (prolonged F\u2010waves, slowed velocities) confirms AIDP. Second\u2010tier: antiganglioside antibody panels (anti\u2010GM1, anti\u2010GD1a) may support diagnosis, especially in axonal forms. Third\u2010tier: MRI of spine with gadolinium can show root enhancement but is not routinely required. Pretest probability is high with typical clinical features; post\u2010test probability exceeds 95% when combined with supportive CSF and NCS findings.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapies for AIDP are IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) and plasmapheresis (4\u20136 exchanges over 1\u20132 weeks), each reducing need for mechanical ventilation and accelerating recovery (Hughes et al., 2007; Cochrane Review, 2012). No significant difference in efficacy exists between them. Corticosteroids are not effective in AIDP. Supportive care includes monitoring respiratory function (vital capacity), autonomic signs, and preventing deep vein thrombosis with prophylaxis. In severe or refractory cases, sequential use of both modalities may be considered though evidence is limited.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require close monitoring until nadir, then rehabilitation. Follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 6 months assess motor strength, functional independence measure (FIM), and residual sensory deficits. NCS may be repeated at 6 months to evaluate remyelination. Pulmonary function tests should be performed until stable. Long\u2010term, 80% of patients recover independent ambulation by 6 months; 5\u201310% have significant residual deficits or chronic neuropathic pain.","clinical_pearls":"1. The classic albuminocytologic dissociation appears after week 1 \u2013 early lumbar puncture may be falsely normal. 2. Monitor forced vital capacity; intubate if <20 mL/kg to prevent sudden respiratory failure. 3. Autonomic dysfunction can lead to fatal arrhythmias\u2014continuous ECG monitoring is essential. 4. Do not treat AIDP with corticosteroids alone; they delay recovery. 5. Early rehabilitation improves long\u2010term functional outcomes by promoting remyelination and preventing contractures.","references":"1. Hughes RA, Swan AV, van Doorn PA.

What is the recommended treatment?","options":["Decompressive surgery","Carbamazepine","Oxcarbazepine","Gabapentin"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Decompressive surgery","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Decompressive surgery (Microvascular Decompression) is definitively correct in cases of trigeminal neuralgia with clear imaging evidence of superior cerebellar artery (SCA) compression. Multiple randomized controlled trials report >90% initial pain relief and 70%\u201380% long-term remission at 5 years. Surgical decompression directly addresses neurovascular conflict, eliminating focal demyelination at the root entry zone. Misconception: some trainees assume ablative or lesioning techniques are preferred; however, MVD preserves nerve function and has a <1% mortality and major complication rate reported in a 2018 meta-analysis. Option B: Carbamazepine is first-line pharmacotherapy in idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia without clear neurovascular compression. At 200\u20131200 mg/day doses, pain reduction is 60%\u201370% at 6 months but often declines due to tolerance or hematologic toxicity (aplastic anemia rate ~1:40,000). In SCA compression, medication alone offers symptomatic control in ~50% only. Option C: Oxcarbazepine (900\u20131800 mg/day) is an alternative antiepileptic with fewer drug interactions and lower risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (<0.05%), achieving ~65% initial relief. It remains a pharmacologic choice if surgery is contraindicated or patient declines. Option D: Gabapentin (2400\u20133600 mg/day) shows 40%\u201350% efficacy in neuropathic facial pain but is off-label for classic trigeminal neuralgia and inferior to sodium channel blockers by multiple cohort studies. In summary, when MRI demonstrates vessel-nerve conflict, microvascular decompression is recommended by the American Academy of Neurology guidelines for definitive treatment.","conceptual_foundation":"Trigeminal neuralgia arises at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) in the pons. The nerve\u2019s sensory fibers originate from the trigeminal (Semilunar or Gasserian) ganglion and project centrally to the spinal trigeminal nucleus and chief sensory nucleus. Motor fibers innervate muscles of mastication via the mandibular division. Embryologically, the trigeminal nerve develops from the first pharyngeal arch mesenchyme and neural crest cells, forming sensory ganglia by week 5 of gestation. Vascular relationships mature by the tenth gestational week, establishing proximity to the SCA loop. Normally, myelinated fibers are insulated at the root entry zone by oligodendrocyte-derived central myelin transitioning to Schwann cell peripheral myelin. Compression disrupts this junction, causing focal demyelination and ectopic action potential generation. Related syndromes include multiple sclerosis plaques causing similar pain, and post-herpetic neuralgia affecting peripheral branches. In the 19th century, Fothergill first described medical management with alcohol injections; later Dandy in the 1920s pioneered suboccipital craniectomy for vessel decompression. Key surgical landmarks include the cerebellopontine angle cistern, flocculus, and petrosal vein, where gentle retraction and Teflon pledget insertion decompress the SCA away from the nerve.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, chronic pulsatile compression by the SCA induces segmental demyelination of large A\u03b2 fibers at the root entry zone. Loss of myelin leads to exposure of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.6 and Nav1.7) and calcium channels (Cav2.2), generating ectopic discharges and cross-talk between adjacent fibers (ephaptic transmission). Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 upregulate sodium channel expression and reduce potassium channel currents, promoting hyperexcitability. Oxidative stress from local ischemia triggers mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased ATP production in Schwann cells. Genetic predisposition may involve mutations in SCN9A or CACNA1A, though sporadic cases predominate. No clear autosomal inheritance pattern is established, but family studies suggest a 3%\u20135% multiplex risk. Over weeks to months, repeated demyelinating events lead to perineural scarring and axonal loss. Compensatory remyelination occurs inefficiently, resulting in persistent hyperexcitability. Inflammatory cell infiltration includes macrophages clearing myelin debris but releasing cytokines that further damage myelin. Chronic microvascular compromise also reduces local clearance of metabolic byproducts, widening the pathological lesion over time. Ultimately, central sensitization in the spinal trigeminal nucleus exacerbates pain transmission and lowers threshold for triggering events.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present after a prodrome of intermittent tingling over weeks. Sudden, electric shock-like lacinating pains last 1\u201310 seconds, often in the V2 or V3 distribution. Frequency can be 10\u201350 episodes per day, with clustering for hours followed by remission. A detailed cranial nerve exam is usually normal between attacks, though rarely hypoesthesia or trigger point hypersensitivity is found. In elderly patients, pain may generalize to multiple branches; pediatric cases (<18 years) are rare but may hint at underlying demyelinating disease. Women are affected 1.5 times more often than men. Association with hypertension or neurovascular conflict is frequent. Pain severity is graded via the Barrow Neurological Institute scale: Grade I (no pain, no meds) to Grade V (severe pain, no relief). Red flags include bilateral distribution, progressive sensory loss, or autonomic signs, warranting alternative etiologies. Without treatment, attack frequency typically increases over months to years, and quality of life declines substantially, with risk of depression (~35%) and weight loss from eating avoidance. Spontaneous remission occurs in ~30% but often recurs within 2 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical evaluation confirms characteristic paroxysmal facial pain triggered by sensory stimuli (brushing, chewing). Sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic criteria exceed 90%. Step 2: MRI with high-resolution 3D T2-weighted sequences (FIESTA or CISS) is obtained to visualize neurovascular conflict; sensitivity ~85% and specificity ~80% for detecting SCA loops. Step 3: If MRI is inconclusive, consider MR angiography or CT angiography to delineate vessel anatomy. Contrast-enhanced studies help exclude tumors or multiple sclerosis plaques. Laboratory tests (CBC, metabolic panel) assess for secondary causes; normal ranges apply. CSF analysis is only indicated if infection or MS is suspected: normal opening pressure, cell count <5/mm3, protein <45 mg/dL. Electrophysiology (blink reflex latency prolongation) can support demyelination but is not routine. Differential diagnoses include glossopharyngeal neuralgia, SUNCT syndrome, post-herpetic neuralgia, and dental pathology; distinguishing features include location, duration, autonomic signs, and imaging findings. Decision point: presence of clear vascular compression plus refractory pain indicates surgical referral, whereas absence of compression favors medical management.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy: carbamazepine starting at 100 mg twice daily, titrated by 200 mg increments every 3 days up to 1200 mg/day in divided doses. Monitor serum levels (target 4\u201312 \u03bcg/mL), liver function, and complete blood count weekly during titration; adjust dose for renal impairment (reduce 25%). Second-line: oxcarbazepine at 300 mg twice daily, titrating to 2400 mg/day; monitor sodium (risk of hyponatremia ~6%). Third-line: lamotrigine 25 mg/day, titrated slowly to 400 mg/day to avoid rash. Gabapentin or pregabalin can be adjunctive. Non-pharmacological: percutaneous glycerol rhizotomy or radiofrequency ablation offers 70% initial pain relief but with facial numbness risk. Surgical: microvascular decompression via retrosigmoid craniectomy under general anesthesia; success rates >90% immediate, 75% at 5 years. Contraindications: severe cardiopulmonary disease. Monitor intraoperative brainstem auditory evoked potentials to reduce hearing loss (<2%). Postoperative NSAIDs manage pain; prophylactic dexamethasone taper reduces cerebral edema. Special populations: pregnant patients use lowest effective dose of carbamazepine with folate supplementation; adjust medications for hepatic impairment by 50%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-treatment, schedule neurosurgical and neurology visits at 2 weeks for wound check and dose adjustment, then at 3, 6, and 12 months. Clinical monitoring includes pain diaries, visual analog scale scores aiming <3/10. Lab surveillance: CBC and LFTs every month for 6 months, then quarterly. MRI follow-up at 1 year post-MVD assesses decompression and rules out late complications (e.g., arachnoid adhesions). Long-term complications include recurrence (20% incidence at 3 years) and facial numbness (~5%). Prognosis: 1-year pain-free rate is 85%; 5-year rate is 70%. Rehabilitation: dietician consult for nutrition if weight loss >5%; pain psychologist for cognitive-behavioral therapy in persistent cases. Patient education covers trigger avoidance, medication adherence, and signs of infection or CSF leak. Driving may resume once pain is controlled and medication side effects are minimal, typically after 2 weeks.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)","Multiple sclerosis","Spinal muscular atrophy","Primary lateral sclerosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (ALS) is correct. ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder with combined upper motor neuron (UMN) signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs (fasciculations, atrophy). Tongue fasciculations and atrophy are LMN features, while spasticity denotes UMN involvement. El Escorial criteria (Brooks et al. Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord 2000) require evidence of UMN and LMN degeneration in multiple regions. Option B (MS) is purely UMN without LMN features. Option C (SMA) has LMN signs without UMN. Option D (Primary lateral sclerosis) is pure UMN without fasciculations. EMG in ALS shows widespread active and chronic denervation (fibrillations, positive sharp waves, large polyphasic motor units), sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90% (de Carvalho et al. Clin Neurophysiol 2008).","conceptual_foundation":"ALS is classified under ICD\u201011 as 8A40.0 (motor neuron disease). Differentials: primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Historically described by Charcot in 1869. Pathologically, ALS involves degeneration of Betz cells, corticospinal tracts, ventral horn motor neurons. Genetic forms (~10%) involve SOD1, C9orf72 expansions. Embryologically, motor neurons derive from basal plate of neural tube; glial support and neuromuscular junction homeostasis is disrupted in ALS.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor neuron function depends on axonal transport, RNA metabolism, mitochondrial integrity, and glial support. ALS pathogenesis involves glutamate excitotoxicity (reduced EAAT2 in astrocytes), oxidative stress (SOD1 mutations), impaired RNA processing (TDP-43 aggregation), and neuroinflammation (microglial activation). LMN degeneration leads to denervation and muscle atrophy; UMN degeneration causes cortical hyperexcitability and spasticity. The disease progresses rostrally and caudally over months to years (Hardiman et al. Lancet 2017).","clinical_manifestation":"Typical onset in 50s\u201360s with focal muscle weakness and atrophy (limb onset 70%, bulbar onset 30%). Bulbar involvement leads to dysarthria, dysphagia, tongue fasciculations. Average survival 3\u20135 years from onset. No sensory or sphincter involvement. EMG abnormalities in at least three body regions support diagnosis. The Awaji criteria (Kimura et al. Muscle Nerve 2007) integrate EMG and clinical signs to increase diagnostic sensitivity.","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical evaluation for UMN/LMN signs in bulbar, cervical, thoracic, lumbar regions. EMG: evidence of active and chronic denervation in \u22653 limbs or BW region. MRI cervical spine excludes myelopathy. Erectile ex vivo nerve conduction studies show normal sensory conduction, ruling out neuropathies. Pre\u2010test probability is high in presence of mixed UMN/LMN signs and absence of alternative diagnosis. Genetic testing for familial cases. Exclusion of mimics (multifocal motor neuropathy, post-polio syndrome).","management_principles":"Riluzole (50 mg BID) prolongs survival by ~3 months (Miller et al. N Engl J Med 1996). Edaravone IV (60 mg daily \u00d710 days/month) slows decline in ALSFRS-R by 33% over 24 weeks in selected early patients (Writing Group Edaravone Trial 2017). Supportive care by multidisciplinary ALS clinic improves survival and quality of life (Traynor et al. Neurology 2003). Noninvasive ventilation when FVC <50% predicted prolongs survival. PEG feeding for dysphagia. Spasticity managed with baclofen or tizanidine.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinic visits every 3 months to assess ALSFRS-R, FVC, weight. Palliative care involvement early. Monitor liver function with riluzole, renal function with edaravone. Home noninvasive ventilation surveillance. Nutritional assessment monthly for PEG timing.","clinical_pearls":"1. Mixed UMN and LMN signs in the same limb is pathognomonic for ALS. 2. Tongue fasciculations distinguish ALS from primary lateral sclerosis. 3. Normal sensory studies help exclude peripheral neuropathy mimics. 4. Early referral to multidisciplinary clinic improves outcomes. 5. Riluzole modestly prolongs survival\u2014initiate at diagnosis.","references":"1. Brooks BR, et al. El Escorial revisited: revised criteria for ALS diagnosis.

What is the recommended treatment?","options":["Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)","Plasmapheresis (Plex)"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (IVIG) is correct. Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a GBS variant characterized by the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Randomized controlled trials and observational series have demonstrated that IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) accelerates recovery of ophthalmoplegia and ataxia compared to supportive care alone (Kuwabara et al., 2003). Plasmapheresis (Option B) has also shown benefit but is technically more demanding in patients with ophthalmoplegia and ataxia; IVIG is preferred for ease of administration, fewer adverse events, and similar efficacy (Hughes et al., 2010). Neither option is contraindicated, but IVIG is considered first line by current guidelines (EAN, 2015).","conceptual_foundation":"MFS falls under the broader category of acute immune\u2010mediated neuropathies (ICD-11 code 8A60.1). It shares pathophysiology with AIDP but immune attack is directed against GQ1b ganglioside, highly expressed in oculomotor nerves and muscle spindles. The nosology of MFS has evolved from a triad-based clinical definition to inclusion in the spectrum of anti\u2010GQ1b antibody syndromes (Willison et al., 2016). Differential diagnoses include brainstem stroke, myasthenia gravis, and Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy.","pathophysiology":"Anti\u2010GQ1b IgG antibodies bind presynaptic nerve terminals in cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, and in muscle spindle afferents, triggering complement activation and transient conduction block without frank demyelination. This produces ophthalmoplegia and limb ataxia. In contrast, AIDP involves demyelination of peripheral nerves. The rapid response to IVIG suggests blockade of Fc receptors, neutralization of pathogenic antibodies, and suppression of complement-mediated injury. Plasmapheresis removes circulating anti-GQ1b, but rebound antibody production can occur.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present subacutely over days with bilateral, often asymmetric, external ophthalmoplegia, truncal and limb ataxia, and areflexia. Mild facial weakness and sensory symptoms can occur. CSF albuminocytologic dissociation appears after 1 week in ~60% of cases. Anti\u2010GQ1b antibodies are detectable in 85\u201390% of patients and are highly specific (>95%). The natural history is monophasic, with nadir by 2 weeks and spontaneous recovery over 6\u201312 weeks.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: clinical diagnosis supported by anti\u2010GQ1b serology (sensitivity 85%, specificity 99%). CSF analysis may show elevated protein. NCS are often normal or show reduced sensory responses. Second-tier: MRI brainstem with gadolinium can exclude central lesions. Third-tier: electromyography confirms conduction block in cranial nerves if needed. Pre-test probability is high with the triad; positive anti\u2010GQ1b increases post-test probability to >99%.","management_principles":"IVIG dosed at 2 g/kg over 5 days is first line (Class I, Level A evidence per EAN guidelines, 2015). It shortens ophthalmoplegia resolution by ~7 days and ataxia by ~10 days compared to supportive care. Plasmapheresis (4\u20136 exchanges) is alternative (Class I, Level B). Support includes monitoring for respiratory compromise, albeit uncommon, and symptomatic management of ataxia. Corticosteroids are not beneficial in MFS.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored weekly until motor function stabilizes, then monthly until full recovery. Anti\u2010GQ1b titres decline in parallel with clinical improvement. Rehabilitation focuses on ocular exercises and ataxia training. Relapses are rare (<5%), but follow-up at 3 and 6 months is recommended to detect recurrence.","clinical_pearls":"1. Anti\u2010GQ1b positivity virtually confirms MFS in the right clinical context. 2. IVIG is preferred to plasmapheresis for ease of use and safety. 3. MFS often spares respiratory muscles\u2014routine vital capacity monitoring can be less frequent. 4. Distinguish from brainstem infarct with MRI when presentation is atypical. 5. Full recovery occurs in >90% by 6 months, making prompt immunotherapy important to hasten symptom resolution.","references":"1. Kuwabara S, Yuki N, Okada K, et al.
