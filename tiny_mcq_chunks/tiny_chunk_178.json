Zidovudine, lamivudine, and maraviroc have far lower risk of inducing seizures. Efavirenz\u2019s lipophilicity allows high CNS penetration, where it interferes with GABAergic and NMDA receptor function, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability.","conceptual_foundation":"Efavirenz is a non\u2010nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that readily crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier. Within the CNS, it interacts with neurotransmitter receptors, causing direct neurotoxicity. Unlike nucleoside analogues (zidovudine, lamivudine) which act intracellularly on viral DNA synthesis without significant off-target receptor interactions, efavirenz\u2019s chemical structure predisposes to CNS adverse events.","pathophysiology":"Efavirenz modulates GABA_A and NMDA receptors, reducing inhibitory tone and promoting excitotoxicity. It may also alter mitochondrial function in neurons, leading to oxidative stress. The net effect is neuronal hyperexcitability and lowered seizure threshold, particularly in patients with preexisting risk factors.","clinical_manifestation":"CNS adverse effects usually occur within 2\u20136 weeks of therapy initiation and can include dizziness, sleep disturbances, mood changes, rarely progressing to new\u2010onset seizures. Symptoms often resolve or lessen after dose adjustment or drug switch.","diagnostic_approach":"In HIV patients presenting with seizures, review HAART regimen. If on efavirenz, consider drug as precipitant. EEG may show generalized discharges but is non\u2010specific. Exclude CNS opportunistic infections, metabolic derangements, and neoplasms via imaging and laboratory testing.","management_principles":"Mild neuropsychiatric side effects may be managed with dose splitting or bedtime dosing. For seizures, discontinue or replace efavirenz with alternative NNRTI (e.g., rilpivirine) or integrase inhibitor, and initiate antiepileptic therapy as needed.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for resolution of neurotoxic symptoms after regimen change. Periodically assess mood, sleep patterns, and any recurrent seizures.","clinical_pearls":["Efavirenz\u2019s CNS penetration accounts for both its efficacy against HIV reservoirs and its neurotoxicity.","Risk factors for efavirenz\u2010induced seizures include low body weight and rapid metabolism (CYP2B6 polymorphisms).","Switching to an integrase inhibitor often resolves neuropsychiatric side effects.","Seizures emerging on HAART warrant review of drug interactions with antiepileptics.","Monitor HIV viral load after any regimen changes to ensure continued virologic suppression."],"references":["4.

Excessive pyridoxine (>200\u2009mg/day chronically) causes a sensory neuronopathy targeting dorsal root ganglia, leading to predominant large-fiber loss and resultant sensory ataxia (Parry & Bredesen, 1985). Motor weakness (A) can occur but is secondary and mild. Cranial nerve palsies (C) and seizures (D) are not features of pyridoxine toxicity. Sensory ataxia manifests as positive Romberg sign and impaired joint position sense. Level B evidence supports dorsal root ganglion toxicity with high-dose pyridoxine.","conceptual_foundation":"Pyridoxine is water-soluble; excess is excreted but chronic high doses can accumulate. In ICD-11, toxic neuropathy due to drugs is coded under 6C61. Dorsal root ganglia are uniquely susceptible due to fenestrated capillaries and reliance on active transport of B6. Differentials include tabes dorsalis, B12 deficiency, and other toxic neuropathies (cisplatin).","pathophysiology":"High B6 levels paradoxically inhibit pyridoxal kinase, leading to neuronal energy failure. Dorsal root ganglion neurons accumulate toxic B6 metabolites, causing apoptosis. Large-myelinated fibers degenerate first, impairing proprioceptive input. This results in sensory ataxia without significant motor fiber involvement until late stages.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report gait imbalance, impaired position sense, and vibration loss in lower limbs. Sensory ataxia worsens in low\u2010light or with eyes closed. Onset is insidious over weeks to months of high\u2010dose therapy. Tendon reflexes are diminished. Motor strength is relatively preserved until severe cases.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: clinical exam showing Romberg positivity. Nerve conduction studies reveal absent or reduced sensory action potentials with preserved motor responses. Serum B6 levels >2000\u2009nmol/L support toxicity. Second-tier: dorsal root ganglion biopsy if needed, showing neuronal loss.","management_principles":"Immediate cessation of pyridoxine. Gradual reduction leads to partial recovery over months as dorsal root ganglia regenerate. No specific antidote exists. Symptomatic management includes balance training and physical therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess neurologic function monthly. Repeat nerve conduction studies at 3 and 6\u2009months. Provide rehabilitation to address ataxia. Counsel against re-initiation of high\u2010dose supplements.","clinical_pearls":"1. Pyridoxine neuropathy is a pure sensory ganglionopathy\u2014look for Romberg sign. 2. Toxicity threshold is ~200\u2009mg/day chronically. 3. Recovery may be incomplete if exposure >6\u2009months. 4. Distinguish from B12 deficiency by normal motor conduction. 5. Educate patients on risks of OTC high-dose B6 supplements.","references":"1. Parry GJ, Bredesen DE.

Which medication is most likely responsible?","options":["Keppra","Lacosamide","Phenytoin","Valproate (VA)"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Phenytoin","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: Phenytoin. Maternal phenytoin use during pregnancy increases risk of fetal bleeding complications, including vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factor inhibition leading to neonatal hemorrhages such as intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Multiple cohort studies (e.g., Vajda et al. 2015) report odds ratios of 4.2 for neonatal hemorrhages with phenobarbital or phenytoin. Phenytoin induces hepatic cytochromes, accelerating vitamin K metabolism, resulting in hypoprothrombinemia. Keppra (levetiracetam) and lacosamide have no significant teratogenic or coagulopathy risks. Valproate is associated with neural tube defects, hepatotoxicity, and neurodevelopmental delay but not specifically IVH via vitamin K depletion.","conceptual_foundation":"Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) cross the placenta and affect fetal organ systems. Phenytoin, a hydantoin, is an inducer of CYP enzymes and reduces maternal and fetal levels of vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. The teratogenic effects are classified in FDA Pregnancy Category D. Differential teratogenic risks: valproate\u2014neural tube; carbamazepine\u2014craniofacial anomalies; phenytoin\u2014fetal hydantoin syndrome and bleeding.","pathophysiology":"Phenytoin induces CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, leading to enhanced vitamin K metabolism and decreased \u03b3-carboxylation of clotting factors in the fetal liver. Neonatal vitamin K\u2013dependent factors are already low at birth; further depletion predisposes to bleeding into germinal matrix and ventricles. The hemorrhages typically occur within the first 72 hours of life. Valproate\u2019s teratogenicity arises from histone deacetylase inhibition and oxidative stress pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"Neonatal IVH presents with seizures, apnea, bulging fontanelle, pallor, and hypotension. Grade III\u2013IV IVH can lead to hydrocephalus, periventricular leukomalacia, and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. In contrast, valproate\u2013exposed infants more typically show midline defects without isolated bleeding.","diagnostic_approach":"Transfontanelle cranial ultrasound within 24\u201348 hours of birth is the diagnostic modality of choice, with sensitivity >90% for Grade II\u2013IV IVH. Coagulation studies will show prolonged prothrombin time and low vitamin K\u2013dependent factors. Maternal drug history is critical. In resource-limited settings, clinical exam and transillumination may raise suspicion.","management_principles":"Immediate management includes vitamin K administration (0.5\u20131 mg IM) to the neonate and fresh frozen plasma if bleeding is active. Phenytoin exposure warrants monitoring of coagulation and possible prophylactic vitamin K at birth. Long-term management of IVH sequelae may include ventriculoperitoneal shunting for hydrocephalus.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial cranial ultrasounds (weekly until hemorrhage resolves), developmental assessments every 3\u20136 months for the first 2 years, and hearing/vision screening as indicated. Monitor for post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and introduce early intervention services.","clinical_pearls":"1. Phenytoin\u2019s enzyme induction causes vitamin K deficiency\u2013related neonatal bleeding. 2. Prophylactic maternal vitamin K during last month may reduce risks. 3. Levetiracetam is safer in pregnancy regarding bleeding and malformations. 4. Early cranial ultrasound is essential in symptomatic neonates. 5.

In patients with recurrent vomiting\u2014particularly hyperemesis gravidarum\u2014there is risk of thiamine deficiency leading to Wernicke encephalopathy. Current literature supports prophylactic thiamine 100\u2009mg IV daily until oral intake is adequate (Oudman et al. 2019). No other vitamin or medication has this neuroprotective role.","conceptual_foundation":"Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a water-soluble vitamin essential for pyruvate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the Krebs cycle. Deficiency impairs cerebral energy metabolism, classically causing Wernicke encephalopathy. In ICD-11, thiamine deficiency is classified under NEURO nutritional disorders; related conditions include beriberi and dry beriberi. Historically described in alcoholics, it also occurs in prolonged vomiting.","pathophysiology":"Normal thiamine is phosphorylated to thiamine pyrophosphate, a cofactor for key mitochondrial enzymes. Deficiency leads to neuronal energy failure, excitotoxicity, and breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier, predominantly affecting mammillary bodies and periaqueductal gray. Acute loss of function manifests rapidly with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Wernicke encephalopathy presents with the classic triad: ophthalmoplegia (30\u201370%), ataxia (23\u2013100%), and confusion (80\u201390%); many patients have only partial features. In pregnant women, prodromal vomiting may be accompanied by nystagmus and gait instability.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical; MRI shows symmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in mammillary bodies (sensitivity 53%, specificity 93%). Blood thiamine levels are neither sensitive nor specific acutely. Pre-test probability is high in hyperemesis gravidarum, justifying empirical therapy.","management_principles":"Administer high-dose thiamine IV (100\u2009mg daily) before any glucose infusion. Class I recommendation (AAN 2010). Continue until symptoms resolve and oral intake is stable. No other medications are indicated for prophylaxis of Wernicke encephalopathy in this context.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess neurologic signs daily. After IV therapy, transition to oral thiamine 100\u2009mg daily for a minimum of one month. Monitor for resolution of nystagmus and ataxia. If persistent signs, consider repeat MRI at 4\u20136 weeks.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always give thiamine before glucose in at-risk patients to prevent precipitating Wernicke encephalopathy. 2. Vomiting in pregnancy can mimic hyperemesis\u2013monitor for neurologic signs. 3. MRI may be negative early; treat empirically. 4. Ophthalmoplegia in pregnancy is red flag for thiamine deficiency. 5.
