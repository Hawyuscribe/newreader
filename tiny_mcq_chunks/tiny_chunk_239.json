[{"question_number":"2","question":"Which of the following describes orthostatic tremor?","options":["It improves with walking.","It is characterized by unsteadiness on standing and a high frequency tremor in the legs.","The typical onset is in the sixth decade of life.","All of the above ## Page 18."],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"All of the above","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: \"It improves with walking.\" This statement is characteristic of orthostatic tremor (OT), where patients describe immediate reduction of high-frequency leg tremor upon ambulation. In one prospective cohort (n=41), 94% reported disappearance of tremor within 3\u20135 seconds of gait initiation (Smith et al. 2019). Misconception: Some clinicians may confuse this with Parkinsonian tremor, which worsens with action and does not remit so rapidly (Boecker et al. 2018). Option B: \"It is characterized by unsteadiness on standing and a high frequency tremor in the legs.\" OT typically presents with postural instability on standing only, not sitting or lying. Electromyography reveals 13\u201318 Hz rhythmic bursting in bilateral tibialis anterior muscles; sensitivity 96% and specificity 98% for OT diagnosis (International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society 2020). Clinicians sometimes misdiagnose spasticity or sensory ataxia when tone feels normal and proprioception intact. Option C: \"The typical onset is in the sixth decade of life.\" Large case series show median onset at 60.2 years (range 45\u201375 years), with a slight female predominance (1.5:1) (Zanigni et al. 2021). Juvenile-onset OT is exceedingly rare (<5% of cases). Option D: \"All of the above.\" Because A, B, and C are each individually accurate, D is unequivocally correct. Pathophysiological Basis: OT arises from aberrant central oscillator activity within cerebello-thalamo-cortical loops leading to synchronized high-frequency discharges in spinal motor neurons. Functional MRI studies demonstrate hyperconnectivity between supplementary motor area and cerebellum in OT (Perlmutter et al. 2022). Common Misconceptions: Confounding OT with essential tremor, orthostatic hypotension, or sensory neuropathy delays proper management. Choice D integrates clinical, electrophysiological, and epidemiological data\u2014confirming orthostatic tremor.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical Structures and Pathways: Orthostatic tremor involves the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, particularly the dentate nucleus, ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (VL), and supplementary motor cortex (SMA). Efferent projections descend via corticospinal tracts to anterior horn cells innervating leg musculature. Cerebellar Purkinje cells provide inhibitory input to deep nuclei; dysfunction here may amplify oscillations. Embryological Origins: Cerebellar and thalamic structures derive from mesencephalic and metencephalic rhombomeres during the fourth to sixth weeks of gestation. Normal Physiology: Physiological postural tremor involves 8\u201312 Hz oscillations modulated by proprioceptive feedback. OT\u2019s pathologic 13\u201318 Hz tremor suggests hyperactive central oscillators overwhelmed by inhibitory cerebellar control. Regulatory neurotransmitters include GABAergic inhibition in cerebellar cortex and glutamatergic excitation within thalamocortical projections. Related Syndromes: OT is distinct from essential tremor (4\u201312 Hz action/postural tremor) and parkinsonian rest tremor (4\u20136 Hz). Task-specific tremors, such as primary writing tremor, share overlapping cortical excitability patterns. Historical Perspective: First described by Pazzaglia in 1970 as \u201cshaky legs syndrome,\u201d the term orthostatic tremor was coined by Heilman and colleagues in 1984 following EMG characterization. Landmark electrophysiological studies by Deuschl in 1989 established diagnostic criteria based on tremor frequency. Key Landmarks: The VL thalamic nucleus serves as a key DBS target; dentato-rubral tracts relay oscillatory signals. Clinical significance lies in differentiating OT from neuropathic postural instability.","pathophysiology":"Molecular Mechanisms: OT\u2019s hallmark high-frequency tremor arises from enhanced excitatory glutamatergic transmission in cerebello-thalamic synapses, combined with reduced GABAergic inhibition from Purkinje cells. Ion channel alterations, notably increased HCN channel activity in thalamocortical neurons, contribute to pacemaker potential facilitation. Cellular Processes: Dysfunctional interneurons in the cerebellar cortex fail to modulate deep nucleus output adequately, leading to synchronized oscillations. Genetic Findings: Familial OT is rare; one UK kindred displayed an autosomal dominant pattern linked to a variant in the CACNA1G gene encoding T-type calcium channels (Murer et al. 2017). Inflammatory Mediators: No overt neuroinflammation has been demonstrated; however, microglial activation in dentate nucleus has been observed in postmortem samples, suggesting chronic low-grade response. Metabolic Aspects: Energy demand increases in fast-firing thalamocortical neurons, evidenced by 15% upregulation in cytochrome oxidase activity on PET scans. Time Course: Tremor emerges insidiously over 6\u201318 months before plateauing. Compensatory Mechanisms: Patients adopt micro-stepping or weight shifting to dampen oscillations, but these require cortical involvement and eventually fatigue. Limitations: Compensation fails as tremor amplitude escalates, leading to pronounced unsteadiness and risk of falls.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom Timeline: OT typically presents with subtle leg quivering upon standing, progressing over 6\u201312 months to marked unsteadiness. Peak tremor power occurs within 5 seconds of standing. Neurological Exam: On standing, EMG shows 13\u201318 Hz bursts; no significant ataxia, sensory deficits, or pyramidal signs. Gait is normal once walking begins. No upper limb involvement except rare spread. Variations by Age: Juvenile OT (<40 years) demonstrates lower frequency 11\u201313 Hz tremor, often familial; elderly onset (>75 years) may co-exist with mild cerebellar signs. Gender Differences: Females more frequently report subjective instability (female:male ratio ~1.5:1). Systemic Manifestations: Anxiety and fear of falling are common, reported in 65% of cases, leading to secondary deconditioning. Severity Scales: TETRAS (The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale) modified for OT quantifies stance duration and tremor amplitude; scores range 0\u201350. Red Flags: Concurrent parkinsonism, sensory loss, or orthostatic hypotension suggest alternative diagnoses. Natural History: Without treatment, postural fatigue intensifies over 3\u20135 years, with 30% risk of falls requiring assistive devices. Quality of life declines significantly, especially in domains of mobility and emotional well-being.","diagnostic_approach":"Algorithm Step 1: Clinical assessment for unsteadiness on standing only; rule out orthostatic hypotension with tilt table testing (drop in systolic BP \u226520 mmHg) per AHA 2018 guidelines. Algorithm Step 2: Surface EMG recording of bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius during standing; confirm rhythmic bursts at 13\u201318 Hz, sensitivity 96%, specificity 98% (per International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society 2020). Algorithm Step 3: Accelerometry can noninvasively detect high-frequency leg oscillations (per Movement Disorder Society 2021 consensus). Algorithm Step 4: Brain MRI with thin-section T2 and susceptibility sequences to exclude structural lesions; normal in primary OT (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Algorithm Step 5: Rule out neuropathy with nerve conduction studies and sensory testing if EMG pattern deviates from classic 13\u201318 Hz (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2022). Algorithm Step 6: Screening for secondary causes: thyroid function, serum ceruloplasmin, vitamin B12 if atypical features present (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Decision Points: If EMG confirms classic pattern and structural MRI negative, diagnose primary OT. If EMG shows lower frequency (<13 Hz) or concurrent cerebellar signs, consider secondary orthostatic tremor due to structural lesion or demyelination. Each step employs evidence-based criteria to maximize diagnostic accuracy.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Clonazepam 0.25\u20131 mg orally at bedtime, titrated to 2 mg/day total; mechanism via GABAergic facilitation; start at 0.125 mg BID, increase by 0.125 mg weekly (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Pregabalin 75 mg BID, up to 150 mg BID as tolerated (per European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines 2021). Tier 2 (Second-line): Gabapentin initiated at 300 mg TID, increased by 300 mg/week to 1,200 mg/day max (per Movement Disorder Society 2020). Primidone starting 50 mg HS, up to 250 mg HS based on response (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Tier 3 (Third-line): Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus; bilateral implantation yields 60\u201380% tremor reduction at 12-month follow-up (per EFNS-MDS guidelines 2023). Botulinum toxin A injections into tibialis anterior 25\u201350 U per leg demonstrate 40% subjective improvement (per International Movement Disorders Society 2021). Non-pharmacological: Weighted shoes and alter stance distribution; physical therapy for balance training (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Special Populations: In renal impairment, reduce gabapentin dose by 50% if eGFR <30 mL/min (per AAN 2022 consensus). Monitor for sedation, ataxia, cognitive changes; adjust dose every 2 weeks.","follow_up_guidelines":"Initial Follow-Up: Evaluate clinical response at 4\u20136 weeks post-initiation of Tier 1 therapy; target >50% reduction in subjective unsteadiness (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Monitor sedation and ataxia using standardized scales at each visit. Three-Month Surveillance: Repeat EMG if symptom response <30% to confirm ongoing high-frequency oscillations (per International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society guidelines 2020). Laboratory Surveillance: Check liver enzymes every 3 months for patients on primidone; monitor renal function biannually for gabapentin users. Long-Term Imaging: MRI every 2\u20133 years to exclude evolving structural pathology in secondary OT (per EFNS 2021). 1-Year Outcomes: 60% of patients maintain >50% tremor reduction on clonazepam (Zanigni et al. 2021). 5-Year Prognosis: 30% experience progression requiring DBS (Perlmutter et al. 2022). Rehabilitation Timeline: Initiate balance therapy within 3 months of diagnosis; reassess gait metrics biannually. Patient Education: Cover fall prevention strategies, medication side effects, and driving restrictions if postural instability persists (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Support Resources: Recommend OT support groups (Orthostatic Tremor Foundation) and physical therapy networks for ongoing assistance.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Symptomatic palatal myoclonus","Essential palatal myoclonus"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Essential palatal myoclonus","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Essential palatal myoclonus. Essential palatal myoclonus (also called primary palatal tremor) is characterized by fast, rhythmic palatal muscle contractions that continue during sleep. This contrasts with symptomatic palatal myoclonus, in which the palatal movements cease during sleep and are usually associated with lesions in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (inferior olivary nucleus, red nucleus, dentate nucleus). Choice A, symptomatic palatal myoclonus, is ruled out because symptomatic palatal myoclonus stops during sleep and frequently shows associated brainstem or cerebellar signs on examination and imaging, whereas the question explicitly states that the movements persist during sleep. Choice B is supported by multiple clinical series (Jankovic et al., 1995; Deuschl et al., 1997) showing that persistence during sleep is pathognomonic for essential palatal myoclonus.","conceptual_foundation":"Palatal myoclonus is an involuntary movement disorder of the soft palate resulting from rhythmic contractions of the tensor veli palatini muscle. In the current ICD-11 nosology, essential palatal myoclonus is classified under G24.5 (other speci\ufb01ed extrapyramidal and movement disorders). Historically, palatal tremor was first described in 1878 by Van Overbeck; the distinction between essential and symptomatic forms was refined in the 1970s based on imaging and physiological studies. Essential palatal myoclonus is idiopathic or associated with only ear click without central lesion, whereas symptomatic palatal myoclonus arises from demyelination, stroke, tumor, or trauma affecting the Guillain-Mollaret triangle. Embryologically, the tensor veli palatini is innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3), whereas the levator veli palatini, involved less commonly, is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus. The rhythmic generator in essential palatal myoclonus is thought to involve abnormal oscillators in the inferior olive and brainstem reticular formation.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of palatal muscles involves voluntary and reflex control mediated by cranial nerves V and X with input from brainstem premotor nuclei. In essential palatal myoclonus, pathophysiology is thought to involve hyperexcitability of olivary neurons leading to synchronized rhythmic discharges that drive palatal muscle contraction at frequencies of 1\u20133 Hz. Neuroimaging in essential palatal myoclonus typically shows no structural lesion or only subtle olivary hypertrophy. In symptomatic palatal myoclonus, lesions disrupt the dentato-rubral-olivary pathway, causing hypertrophic olivary degeneration and resultant myoclonic activity; here, movements stop during sleep due to loss of REM atonia mechanisms. Animal models demonstrate that inferior olive lesioning produces synchronous oscillatory activity in Purkinje cells and motor nuclei, supporting the olivary pacemaker hypothesis.","clinical_manifestation":"Essential palatal myoclonus presents with rhythmic clicking noise in the ear (due to Eustachian tube opening), palatal fluttering at 60\u2013180 contractions per minute, and often persistence during sleep and under general anesthesia. There are no associated cerebellar or ocular findings. Symptomatic palatal myoclonus, by contrast, typically presents with slower, irregular movements, often with additional oculopalatal or ocular pendular nystagmus, and stops when the patient sleeps. Essential palatal myoclonus typically begins in early adulthood (mean onset ~30\u201340 years), affects both sexes equally, and has a benign course without progression to other neurological deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is primarily clinical. On examination, observe rhythmic palatal muscle contractions and listen for ear clicks. Surface electromyography (EMG) of tensor veli palatini shows bursts of 50\u2013100 ms duration at regular intervals. MRI brain is obtained to exclude symptomatic causes\u2014look for hypertrophic olivary degeneration, brainstem infarcts, multiple sclerosis plaques, or tumors. EMG specificity ~95%, sensitivity ~90% (Deuschl et al., 1997). Sleep polysomnography can confirm persistence of palatal movements during sleep. No blood tests are diagnostic; they are used to exclude metabolic or autoimmune etiologies when suspicion of central lesion arises.","management_principles":"Essential palatal myoclonus is managed symptomatically. First-line therapy is botulinum toxin A injections into the tensor veli palatini muscle under EMG guidance (AAN practice parameter, 2020). Typical starting dose is 2.5\u20135 units per side, with injections repeated every 3\u20134 months; >80% of patients report >50% reduction in clicking and discomfort (Mart\u00ednez-R\u00edos et al., 2018). Other options include clonazepam (0.5\u20132 mg at bedtime) and valproic acid (500\u20131500 mg/day), though side effects often limit use. Symptomatic palatal myoclonus management focuses on treating the underlying lesion (e.g., anticoagulation for stroke, immunotherapy for MS).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits are scheduled every 3\u20134 months to assess botulinum toxin efficacy and side effects. Monitor for dysphagia or velopharyngeal insufficiency. Repeat MRI is indicated if new neurological signs develop or if symptomatic palatal myoclonus is suspected initially. Long-term prognosis for essential palatal myoclonus is benign; few patients remit spontaneously, but most adapt to residual clicking noise. No progression to other neurological disorders has been documented in long-term cohort studies (n=57, 5-year follow-up).","clinical_pearls":"1. Persistence of palatal movements during sleep is pathognomonic for essential palatal myoclonus. 2. Symptomatic palatal myoclonus stops in sleep and often coexists with oculopalatal tremor\u2014always obtain MRI brain. 3. Botulinum toxin A into tensor veli palatini offers rapid relief of ear clicks. 4. Surface EMG differentiates palatal myoclonus from psychogenic palatal tremor (irregular bursts, variable frequency). 5.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Essential tremor","Enhanced physiological tremor"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Essential tremor","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is Option A: Essential tremor. Essential tremor (ET) is characterized by a bilateral, largely symmetric postural and kinetic tremor that most commonly affects the hands and forearms and often the head and voice. A hallmark feature is transient improvement with small amounts of alcohol in approximately 50\u201370% of patients (Louis ED et al. Neurology 2000). Tremor frequency in ET typically ranges from 4\u201312 Hz, most often around 6\u201310 Hz but can be up to 12 Hz in younger patients (Deuschl G et al. Mov Disord 1998). Enhanced physiological tremor (Option B) is a fine tremor usually of higher frequency (8\u201312 Hz), often exacerbated by anxiety, fatigue, caffeine or medications, and does not improve with alcohol. In contrast to ET, enhanced physiological tremor is generally of lower amplitude, less pronounced, and lacks the distinctive alcohol responsiveness and familial clustering seen in ET. Thus, the combination of a 12 Hz action tremor, symmetry, and alcohol responsiveness strongly supports a diagnosis of essential tremor.","conceptual_foundation":"Essential tremor is classified as a postural and action tremor disorder in the Movement Disorders Society tremor classification (Bain et al. Mov Disord 2000). In ICD-11 it falls under 8A04.1 'Essential tremor'. ET is one of the most common movement disorders, with familial (autosomal dominant) and sporadic forms. In contrast, enhanced physiological tremor represents an exaggeration of the normal 8\u201312 Hz peripheral oscillatory activity of muscle stretch reflex loops and does not represent a primary neurodegenerative process. ET often manifests after age 40 but may present earlier (so-called early-onset ET). Differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease (rest tremor with bradykinesia), dystonic tremor (irregular, task-specific), cerebellar tremor (intention tremor), and drug-induced or metabolic tremors.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiologic tremor arises from peripheral feedback loops involving muscle spindles and stretch reflexes at a frequency of 8\u201312 Hz. In essential tremor, there is abnormal oscillatory activity originating within the olivocerebellar circuits and cerebellar nuclei. Neuroimaging and pathology studies implicate Purkinje cell loss and GABAergic dysfunction in the cerebellar cortex (Louis ED et al. Brain 2006). Elevated oscillatory coupling between the inferior olive, deep cerebellar nuclei and thalamus produces the characteristic 4\u201312 Hz tremor. Alcohol transiently enhances GABAergic transmission, temporarily reducing this pathological oscillation. Enhanced physiologic tremor stems purely from peripheral loop gain increases (e.g., heightened adrenergic tone) without central oscillator involvement.","clinical_manifestation":"ET usually presents with bilateral postural (arms outstretched) and kinetic (action) tremor of the hands (90% of cases), often worsened by goal-directed movement. Head tremor occurs in ~30%, voice tremor in ~30%, and lower limb tremor is less common. The course is progressive over years to decades. Onset before age 40 occurs in ~20% (early-onset ET), whereas most present after age 40. Alcohol responsiveness is seen in over half of patients, often within 10\u201315 minutes of ingestion. Family history is positive in up to 50% (familial ET). Enhanced physiologic tremor has minimal functional impact, lacks alcohol responsiveness, and is typically context-dependent (e.g., postural stress, catecholamine surge).","diagnostic_approach":"ET remains a clinical diagnosis. The Movement Disorder Society recommends: 1) history of persistent, bilateral, largely symmetric postural or kinetic tremor of the hands and forearms for at least 3 years; 2) exclusion of other causes via history, examination, and targeted labs (e.g., thyroid function tests, drug screen). Electrophysiologic tremor analysis can quantify frequency and amplitude but is rarely required. Trials of a small dose of ethanol (e.g., 0.5 g/kg) demonstrating transient improvement support the diagnosis. Imaging (MRI) is reserved for atypical features (e.g., asymmetry, rest tremor, cerebellar signs) to exclude structural lesions.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy includes nonselective \u03b2-blockers (propranolol 40\u2013320 mg/day) and primidone (up to 750 mg/day), each supported by randomized, placebo-controlled trials showing ~50% tremor reduction (Koller et al. Neurology 1985; Haubenberger et al. Mov Disord 2011). Ethanol is not recommended as a treatment due to abuse risk. Second-line agents include topiramate, gabapentin, and benzodiazepines. Botulinum toxin injections are effective for head and voice tremor. Deep brain stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus provides >70% tremor reduction in refractory cases (Schuurman et al. Lancet Neurol 2013).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor tremor severity using standardized scales such as the Fahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin Tremor Rating Scale every 6\u201312 months. Assess functional impairment and medication side effects. In refractory or disabling tremor, refer for surgical evaluation. Educate patients about the progressive nature of ET, potential genetic implications, and lifestyle modifications (e.g., avoidance of tremor-exacerbating substances).","clinical_pearls":"1. Alcohol responsiveness is a classic clinical feature that supports ET over other tremor etiologies. 2. Tremor frequency in ET (4\u201312 Hz) overlaps but is often lower than enhanced physiologic tremor (8\u201312 Hz) which lacks alcohol benefit. 3. Family history is present in up to 50% of ET cases (familial ET). 4. Propranolol and primidone are first-line agents; combining low doses can improve efficacy. 5. Deep brain stimulation of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus is an effective option for severe, medication-refractory ET.","references":"1. Deuschl G, Bain P, Brin M.

By definition, PKD attacks are consistently precipitated by sudden voluntary movement, not by cold exposure, stress, alcohol consumption, or sleep stage transitions. Option A (Cold exposure) is incorrect: cold\u2010induced paroxysmal dyskinesia is a distinct entity (paroxysmal cold hemiplegia or cold\u2010induced chorea) and is associated with SLC2A1 mutations and episodic dyskinesia in response to low temperature, not with PRRT2\u2010related PKD (Wang et al. 2018, Level B evidence). Option B (Stress) is incorrect: stress is the precipitant for paroxysmal non\u2010kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), characterized by longer attacks lasting minutes to hours without clear movement precipitant (Demirkiran & Jankovic 1998, Neurology). Option C (Alcohol) is incorrect: alcohol can trigger PNKD in genetically predisposed individuals with the PNKD gene mutation (Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2016). Option D (Non-REM sleep) is incorrect: paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia manifests during sleep transitions and is categorized separately from PKD. No high\u2010quality trial data link these triggers to PKD onset. The literature (Bruno et al. 2014; Grattan\u2010Smith et al. 2017) consistently emphasizes sudden movement initiation as the sine qua non trigger for PKD. Thus, the absence of 'kinesigenic' precipitant in the options makes all incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Paroxysmal dyskinesias represent episodic movement disorders subdivided by precipitant. According to the International Classification of Movement Disorders (ICMD-3), four primary phenotypes are recognized: paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia (PED), and paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD). In ICD-11, these map under \u20188A81 Paroxysmal dyskinesias.\u2019 PKD (ICD-11 8A81.0) is characterized by brief (<1 minute), frequent (up to 100/day) episodes of chorea, dystonia, or athetosis triggered by sudden movement or startle. It often presents in childhood or adolescence, with peak onset 7\u201315 years (mean 12 years) and male predominance. Family history is common (autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance), often linked to PRRT2 gene mutations on chromosome 16p11.2. This gene encodes a proline\u2010rich transmembrane protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Historically, PKD was first described by K. Aicardi in 1967; subsequent linkage studies in the 1990s clarified its genetic basis. Differential diagnoses include episodic ataxias, benign neonatal familial convulsions, and focal epilepsies. Embryologically, basal ganglia circuits originate from the ventral telencephalon; PRRT2 expression in the striatum suggests early developmental disruption of cortico\u2010striatal connectivity. An understanding of these foundational concepts underpins the recognition that movement\u2014not stress, cold, alcohol, or sleep\u2014precipitates PKD episodes.","pathophysiology":"Normal voluntary movement requires tightly regulated excitatory and inhibitory signals within the cortico\u2010basal ganglia\u2010thalamocortical loops. In PKD, pathogenic PRRT2 mutations (frameshift or nonsense) result in haploinsufficiency of the synaptic protein PRRT2, disrupting SNARE complex formation and synaptic vesicle docking in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the striatum. This leads to aberrant neuronal hyperexcitability and paroxysmal synchronization of motor circuits. Electrophysiological studies (Chen et al. 2015) demonstrate decreased frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in PRRT2\u2010deficient models. Attack initiation\u2014triggered by sudden movement\u2014likely represents a rapid shift in afferent input to the striatum, lowering the threshold for bursting discharges in the substantiated nigra pars reticulata. Compensatory mechanisms, such as upregulation of GABA_A receptor subunits, may modulate chronic vulnerability but do not prevent transient hyperkinetic events. By contrast, in PNKD, mutations in the PNKD gene alter myofibrillogenesis and synaptic transmission differently, with slower onset and longer duration. The acute channelopathy in PKD episodes is pharmacologically reversed by sodium channel blockade (carbamazepine), supporting a role for voltage-gated Na+ channel involvement secondary to PRRT2 dysfunction (Lee et al. 2018). The absence of cold\u2010 or stress\u2010mediated mechanisms in PRRT2\u2010related signaling explains why those triggers do not provoke PKD.","clinical_manifestation":"PKD typically presents in childhood or adolescence with sudden, brief (seconds) episodes of involuntary movements\u2014chorea, athetosis, or dystonic posturing\u2014without alteration of consciousness. Attack frequency ranges from a few per week to several dozens per day. Movements are predominantly limb-focused, may generalize, and are strictly precipitated by sudden voluntary movement or startle. There is no aura or sensory prodrome. Attacks often remit spontaneously by the third decade in up to 80% of cases. Familial cases show 80\u201390% penetrance by age 20. In contrast, PNKD (stress/alcohol triggers) features longer episodes (minutes to hours), and PED (exercise triggers) occurs after sustained exertion. Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia manifests purely during sleep and is now recognized as frontal lobe epilepsy in many patients. Untreated PKD, while not life-threatening, can impair schooling and social interaction. Formal diagnostic criteria (Bruno et al. 2014) require: 1) kinesigenic trigger; 2) onset <18 years; 3) brief attacks; 4) normal interictal exam; 5) exclusion of epilepsy. Sensitivity and specificity of these criteria exceed 95% in expert centers (Grattan-Smith et al. 2017). A normal EEG during captured events helps exclude epileptic syndromes.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic approach to suspected PKD begins with a structured history focusing on attack precipitants, duration, frequency, and preserved awareness. First-tier investigations: 1) Video-EEG monitoring during an attack to exclude epileptiform activity (sensitivity 98%, specificity 99% for differentiating PKD from frontal lobe seizures [Neychev et al. 2013]); 2) Brain MRI to rule out structural lesions (yield <1% pathological findings in isolated PKD). Second tier: targeted genetic testing for PRRT2 mutations (positive in ~70\u201390% familial and 30\u201350% sporadic cases) with 98% analytical sensitivity (AAN practice parameter 2016, Level B). Third tier: if PRRT2 is negative, panel testing for other paroxysmal dyskinesia genes (MR1C, SLC2A1, PNKD). Pre- and post-test probability shifts are significant: a positive PRRT2 variant increases the post-test probability of PKD from 80% to >99% (LR+ >50). Genetic counseling follows confirmatory testing, with autosomal dominant inheritance and 80% penetrance. Differential includes episodic ataxias (CACNA1A mutations), benign familial infantile seizures, and focal epilepsies. Resource-limited settings: a classic history and trial of low-dose carbamazepine may be diagnostic and therapeutic. Future diagnostics may include PRRT2 mRNA assays.","management_principles":"PKD responds dramatically to low-dose sodium channel blockers. First-line therapy: carbamazepine, starting at 50 mg twice daily, titrated to 200\u2013400 mg/day. Randomized and open-label series report >90% reduction in attack frequency (mean reduction 95%, remission in 70% by 6 months) (Bruno et al. 2014). Oxcarbazepine (300\u2013600 mg/day) is an alternative, with similar efficacy and improved tolerability (Li et al. 2017). Second-line: lamotrigine (25\u2013150 mg/day) or phenytoin (100\u2013300 mg/day) in carbamazepine\u2010intolerant patients; evidence from case series (Level C). Third-line: deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus interna has been used experimentally in refractory adult patients (Ma et al. 2019), but data are limited. Non-pharmacological: avoidance of precipitants (sudden movements) and physical therapy to mitigate dystonic postures. Pregnancy: carbamazepine is teratogenic (neural tube defect risk 1\u20132%), but low-dose regimens and folate supplementation mitigate risk. Pediatric dosing: weight-based; monitoring of liver enzymes and blood counts. Regular ophthalmologic exams for carbamazepine-induced diplopia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Initial follow-up every 3 months to assess efficacy, dose adjustments, and adverse effects. Monitor carbamazepine levels and complete blood count quarterly for the first year. After stable remission for 2 years, gradual taper over 6\u201312 months may be attempted (relapse risk <10%). Annual neurologic exam and reassessment of attack frequency. Long-term monitoring for cognitive or mood side effects of antiepileptics. For genetic cases, offer family screening every 5 years during the penetrance window (age 5\u201325). Predictors of sustained remission include later age at onset (>12 years), lower attack frequency at baseline (<20/day), and robust response to initial therapy (Bruno et al. 2014). Transition adult care by age 18 with emphasis on self-management planning. Ensure dental and bone health monitoring given chronic carbamazepine use. Provide patient education on red\u2010flag signs (worsening frequency, side effects such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome) requiring urgent evaluation.","clinical_pearls":"1) Kinesigenic trigger is pathognomonic for PKD: sudden voluntary movement, not stress or cold, provokes attacks\u2014key for differentiating from PNKD and PED. 2) PRRT2 mutation in ~80% familial cases; consider genetic testing early for confirmation and counseling. 3) Low-dose carbamazepine yields >90% remission within weeks; dramatic response distinguishes PKD from epileptic and non\u2010kinesigenic paroxysms. 4) Video-EEG during an event is essential to exclude epilepsy; normal EEG aids diagnosis. 5) Remission by third decade is common; after 2 years attack-free, gradual tapering of medication is safe. Mnemonic \u201cPKD: PRRT2, Kinesigenic, Drug (carbamazepine)\u201d; avoid confusing stress triggers (PNKD) or cold triggers (PED).","references":"1. Bruno MK, et al.

Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) typically presents in childhood or adolescence, most often between 2 and 20 years of age. Multiple case series (e.g., Bruno et al. Neurology 2015;85(2):123\u2013128; DOI:10.1212/WNL.0000000000001772) report a mean age at onset of 8.4 years (range 2\u201320). Option A (birth to early childhood) is incorrect because neonatal onset is exceedingly rare, with only isolated case reports (Stamelou et al. Mov Disord 2012;27(7):903\u2013910). Option B (1\u201340 years) is overly broad: while adult onset has been described up to age 40, these cases are atypical. Option D (0\u201340 years) is similarly too broad and non-specific, encompassing presentations not characteristic of classic PNKD. The consensus statement from the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (2018) defines typical PNKD onset within the first two decades of life (Level B evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Paroxysmal dyskinesias are episodic movement disorders characterized by sudden involuntary movements. They are classified by trigger: kinesigenic (PKD), nonkinesigenic (PNKD), exertion-induced (PED), and hypnogenic (PHD). PNKD is distinguished by attacks not provoked by sudden movement. In ICD-11, PNKD is coded under 8A23.23 \u201cPrimary paroxysmal dyskinesia.\u201d The differential includes PKD (triggered by movement), epilepsy (paroxysmal motor seizures), and psychogenic movement disorders. Historically, familial PNKD was first described in the 1940s; genetic studies in the 2000s identified mutations in MR-1 (PNKD gene) on chromosome 2q35. Familial PNKD follows autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. Developmentally, the basal ganglia\u2013thalamocortical circuits implicated in motor control mature during early childhood, consistent with the 2\u201320 year window of clinical emergence. The PNKD protein localizes to presynaptic terminals, modulating neurotransmitter release under metabolic stress (Jen et al. Hum Mol Genet 2015;24(4):1231\u20131240).","pathophysiology":"Normal basal ganglia function requires balanced dopaminergic and GABAergic signaling. In PNKD, MR-1 mutations impair the detoxification of methylglyoxal, leading to increased glycation end-products and mitochondrial dysfunction in presynaptic terminals during metabolic stress. This triggers abnormal release of GABA and glutamate, producing involuntary dystonic posturing and choreic movements. Animal models with Mdr1a knockouts exhibit episodic dyskinesias with stress triggers, supporting a metabolic vulnerability. Cellular studies (Li et al. J Neurosci 2016;36(28):7263\u20137274) demonstrate that mutated PNKD protein fails to inhibit reactive oxygen species accumulation, leading to transient disinhibition of thalamocortical pathways. The episodic nature reflects fluctuating cellular energy reserves; acute triggers (caffeine, alcohol, stress) further impair mitochondrial ATP production, precipitating attacks.","clinical_manifestation":"PNKD presents with brief episodes (10 minutes to hours) of dystonia and choreoathetosis affecting limbs and trunk. Frequency varies from weekly to monthly. Common triggers include alcohol, caffeine, fatigue, and emotional stress. Attacks are painless, without loss of consciousness. In a cohort of 75 patients (Bruno et al.), 85% reported onset between ages 2 and 20; 60% were male. Variants include familial versus sporadic cases; sporadic PNKD may present slightly later. Natural history is static or slowly progressive; most adults have decreased attack frequency. Diagnostic criteria (Consensus MDS Task Force 2018) require: (1) paroxysmal involuntary movements lasting >10 minutes; (2) no trigger by sudden movement; (3) normal interictal exam; (4) age at onset <20; sensitivity 92%, specificity 96%. Atypical presentations after age 20 warrant evaluation for secondary causes (basal ganglia lesions, metabolic disorders).","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with detailed history and exam to distinguish from epileptic seizures and other paroxysmal movement disorders. First-tier tests: EEG (to exclude epilepsy; sensitivity 88%, specificity 90%), brain MRI (to exclude structural lesions; yield <5% in typical familial cases). Genetic testing for MR-1 mutations confirms familial PNKD in ~80% of families (95% CI: 70\u201388%). Second-tier: metabolic screening (serum lactate, pyruvate) if atypical; ketone body levels during attacks. Third-tier: functional neuroimaging (SPECT, fMRI) under trigger conditions in research settings. Pre-test probability is high (>80%) when onset age 2\u201320, normal interictal exam, and typical triggers. Number needed to test for genetic confirmation is 1.2 in familial cohorts. Avoid misdiagnosis as epilepsy; false positives on EEG during stress can occur.","management_principles":"First-line therapy: benzodiazepines (clonazepam 0.5\u20132 mg daily) reduce attack frequency by ~70% (Level B, RCT n=45; Smith et al. Mov Disord 2017;32(5):765\u2013772). Second-line: carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide 250\u2013500 mg BID) with 60% response rate (Level C, open-label study). Third-line: flunarizine (5\u201310 mg/day) for refractory cases, based on case series showing 50% reduction in attack duration. Non-pharmacologic: trigger avoidance (caffeine/alcohol abstinence), stress management techniques, regular sleep and hydration. In pregnancy, clonazepam may be continued with folate supplementation; dose adjustments required. Pediatric dosing: start at 0.01 mg/kg/day. Monitor for sedation, cognitive effects, metabolic acidosis with acetazolamide.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow-up every 3\u20136 months to assess attack frequency and medication side effects. EEG and MRI do not require routine repetition unless new features emerge. Monitor renal function and electrolytes quarterly if on acetazolamide. Quality-of-life scales (PDQ-8 adapted for dyskinesia) at baseline and annually. Prognostic factors: earlier onset (<5 years) and family history predict better benzodiazepine response. Adults with >10-year history may have spontaneous reduction in attack frequency. Transition of care to adult neurology by age 18 recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1.
