What characteristic is likely associated with this condition?","options":["Diurnal variation","Alcohol-responsive"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Alcohol-responsive","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. Myoclonus-dystonia (DYT11) is a hereditary movement disorder characterized by segmental dystonia and myoclonic jerks that classically improve with small amounts of alcohol. Multiple case series (Grunewald et al., Mov Disord 2006) have demonstrated that over 70% of patients experience marked symptomatic relief after alcohol ingestion. Option A is incorrect because diurnal variation\u2014worsening of symptoms toward the evening\u2014is a hallmark of dopa-responsive dystonia (Segawa syndrome), not myoclonus-dystonia.","conceptual_foundation":"Myoclonus-dystonia is classified under hyperkinetic movement disorders. It typically presents in childhood or adolescence (mean onset ~10 years) with upper-body myoclonic jerks and mild dystonia. The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion with reduced penetrance due to maternal imprinting of the SGCE gene (encoding \u03b5-sarcoglycan). Differential diagnoses include dopa-responsive dystonia, juvenile Parkinson\u2019s disease, and essential myoclonus.","pathophysiology":"Mutations in SGCE impair the function of \u03b5-sarcoglycan, a transmembrane protein expressed in basal ganglia neurons, leading to dysregulated cortico-striatal signaling. Aberrant GABAergic inhibition and altered cerebellar outflow contribute to both dystonic posturing and myoclonic jerks. Alcohol is thought to enhance GABA_A receptor\u2013mediated inhibition, transiently normalizing network excitability in affected circuits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with action-induced, rhythmical myoclonic jerks of the neck, trunk, and upper limbs, often accompanied by mild dystonic postures. Onset is in childhood or adolescence, with a male predominance. Alcohol responsiveness is virtually pathognomonic: improvement typically occurs within 15\u201330 minutes of ingestion and lasts several hours. Psychiatric comorbidities (anxiety, depression) are common.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by family history and demonstration of alcohol responsiveness. Surface EMG shows short bursts (50\u2013100 ms) of synchronous muscle activity in myoclonus. Brain MRI is normal. Definitive diagnosis requires genetic testing for SGCE mutations; molecular studies detect pathogenic variants in ~50\u201390% of familial cases.","management_principles":"Although alcohol provides temporary relief, it is not a recommended treatment due to addiction risk. First-line pharmacotherapy includes benzodiazepines (clonazepam) or antispasmodics (trihexyphenidyl). For refractory, disabling cases, deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus has demonstrated sustained improvement in myoclonus and dystonia (Ostrem et al., Neurology 2007).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored regularly for motor symptom control, side effects of medications, and development of alcohol dependence. Annual neurologic assessments are recommended, with EMG or video-EMG if clinical features evolve. Psychiatric screening should be performed at each visit.","clinical_pearls":"1. Alcohol responsiveness is a key diagnostic clue for myoclonus-dystonia; 2. SGCE mutations exhibit maternal imprinting\u2014only paternally inherited mutations typically manifest; 3. Diurnal variation suggests dopa-responsive dystonia rather than DYT11; 4. DBS targeting GPi can be life-changing in refractory cases; 5. Always assess for psychiatric comorbidities.","references":"1.

What medication is commonly used to manage this condition?","options":["Amantadine"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Amantadine","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A, Amantadine, is the established pharmacologic intervention for levodopa\u2010induced peak\u2010dose dyskinesias in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Randomized placebo\u2010controlled trials (e.g., Novak et al., 2000; Ondo et al., 2000) demonstrate a 30\u201340% reduction in dyskinesia severity scores with amantadine 200\u2013400 mg daily compared to placebo (p < 0.01). Its primary mechanism is noncompetitive antagonism of NMDA glutamate receptors in the basal ganglia circuitry, reducing excitotoxic overactivity that underlies choreiform movements. No other agents have shown comparable efficacy in peak\u2010dose dyskinesia in level A trials. Since no other options were provided, no further incorrect\u2010option analysis is required.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease (ICD\u201011 8A00) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron loss and accumulation of \u03b1\u2010synuclein. Motor complications of chronic levodopa therapy include motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Peak\u2010dose dyskinesias consist of choreiform hyperkinesias occurring at the zenith of levodopa plasma levels. Differential diagnoses include diphasic dyskinesias (occurring at onset or offset of medication effect) and off\u2010period dystonia. The concept of glutamatergic overactivity in the striatum as a driver of dyskinesia arises from basal ganglia models integrating direct and indirect pathway balance. NMDA receptor antagonists such as amantadine modulate this excitotoxic state, leading to reduced involuntary movements.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta modulate striatal medium spiny neuron excitability via D1 and D2 receptors. Chronic pulsatile levodopa exposure leads to receptor sensitization and maladaptive synaptic plasticity, including upregulation of NMDA\u2010mediated glutamatergic transmission. This results in abnormal synchronization and hyperactivity of thalamocortical projections manifesting as choreiform dyskinesias. Amantadine blocks the NMDA receptor channel on striatal neurons, attenuating calcium influx and excitotoxic cascades, thereby normalizing output of the internal globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus circuits and reducing amplitude of abnormal movements.","clinical_manifestation":"Peak\u2010dose dyskinesias in PD patients present as involuntary choreic or dystonic movements that coincide with maximal benefit of levodopa dosing, typically emerging after 5\u20137 years of therapy. They may involve the face, trunk, and limbs and can be mild to disabling. Frequency increases with higher levodopa doses and greater disease duration. In contrast to off\u2010period dystonia, peak\u2010dose dyskinesias occur during \u201con\u201d times and are alleviated by reducing levodopa or adding antidyskinetic treatment. Severity scales such as the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) quantify impact and guide therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on correlation of dyskinesia timing with medication schedules. First\u2010tier evaluation includes patient history, medication diary, and video documentation. Second\u2010tier assessments include UDysRS scoring by movement disorders specialists. No laboratory or imaging biomarkers are routinely indicated. Differential excludes other hyperkinetic disorders or psychogenic movements. Neurophysiologic studies (EMG) may characterize hyperkinesia patterns but are seldom needed. A trial of dose adjustment versus amantadine can serve as both diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic intervention.","management_principles":"First\u2010line management of peak\u2010dose dyskinesia is amantadine, typically initiated at 100 mg once daily and titrated to 100 mg two or three times daily, with demonstrated number needed to treat (NNT) of 4 for clinically meaningful improvement (level A evidence; AAN 2018). Adverse effects include livedo reticularis, peripheral edema, and confusion, managed via dose adjustment or drug discontinuation. Second\u2010tier strategies involve fractionating levodopa dose, adding dopamine agonists with slower kinetics, or employing extended\u2010release formulations. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is a third\u2010tier option for refractory, disabling dyskinesias after multidisciplinary evaluation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor patients monthly during titration for efficacy and side effects, then every 3\u20136 months once stable. Assess UDysRS and patient diaries to gauge dyskinesia control. Watch for cognitive changes or anticholinergic effects in elderly. Adjust amantadine dose based on renal function every 6 months. Consider tapering if benefit wanes after 1\u20132 years. Coordinate care with physical therapy to maximize functional mobility and reduce fall risk.","clinical_pearls":"1. Peak\u2010dose dyskinesias coincide with highest levodopa levels\u2014distinguish from diphasic and off\u2010period dyskinesias. 2. Amantadine\u2019s antidyskinetic effect is linked to NMDA receptor antagonism\u2014advantage over anticholinergics. 3. Livedo reticularis in 10\u201315% of patients on amantadine is reversible on discontinuation. 4. Early initiation of amantadine at mild dyskinesia may slow progression to severe forms. 5.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, particularly acetazolamide, have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of these episodes by modulating neuronal excitability. L-Dopa (A) is reserved for dopa-responsive dystonias, clonazepam (B) and other benzodiazepines are more often used in paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesias, and conventional anticonvulsants (C) such as carbamazepine are first-line for paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia rather than PED.","conceptual_foundation":"Paroxysmal dyskinesias comprise a group of movement disorders in which episodic hyperkinetic movements occur. They are classified according to triggers: kinesigenic (quick movements), non-kinesigenic (stress, alcohol), and exertion-induced (prolonged exercise). PED typically begins in childhood or adolescence, is triggered by sustained exertion, and can last several minutes. Genetic studies have implicated mutations in the SLC2A1 gene (encoding the GLUT1 glucose transporter) in some cases of PED, though many cases are idiopathic.","pathophysiology":"Although the exact mechanism of PED is not fully understood, it is thought to involve episodic alterations in neuronal pH and ion homeostasis during sustained exertion, leading to transient dysfunction in basal ganglia circuits. Acetazolamide, by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, induces a mild metabolic acidosis that stabilizes neuronal excitability and reduces paroxysmal discharges. In contrast, AEDs like carbamazepine stabilize voltage-gated sodium channels, which is why they are effective in paroxysmal kinesigenic forms but less so in exertion-induced variants.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PED experience bilateral dystonic or choreoathetoid movements in the limbs after several minutes of exertion such as running or prolonged walking. Attacks typically last 5\u201330 minutes and resolve with rest. Between attacks, neurologic examination is normal. Unlike paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, there is no identifiable aura and symptoms are not triggered by sudden movements.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on characteristic triggers and normal interictal examination. Workup may include neuroimaging (brain MRI) to exclude structural lesions and CSF/serum glucose ratio to rule out GLUT1 deficiency. In select cases, EEG or exercise challenge testing may help to exclude epileptic phenomena.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for PED is acetazolamide, typically started at 125 mg twice daily and titrated to effect (up to 500 mg/day). Response rates in case series exceed 70%. Alternative or adjunctive therapies include low-dose valproate or levetiracetam in refractory cases. Lifestyle modifications\u2014such as pacing exercise and ensuring adequate hydration\u2014can also reduce attack frequency.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be followed every 3\u20136 months initially to monitor efficacy and side effects of acetazolamide (including metabolic acidosis, renal stones). Periodic serum electrolytes and renal ultrasound are recommended. Long-term prognosis is favorable; many patients experience reduced attack frequency in adulthood.","clinical_pearls":"1. PED is distinguished from PKD by trigger (prolonged exertion vs. sudden movement) and treatment: acetazolamide for PED, carbamazepine for PKD. 2. Normal interictal exam helps distinguish PED from other dystonias. 3. A trial of acetazolamide can be diagnostic as well as therapeutic. 4.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows tectal atrophy. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"1. Option A: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by early postural instability, frequent backward falls within the first year, and vertical gaze palsy due to midbrain tegmental degeneration. MRI typically shows midbrain (tectal plate) atrophy producing the \u201chummingbird sign\u201d on midsagittal images. Epidemiological studies report an annual incidence of 5.3 per 100,000 in individuals over age 70 (H\u00f6glinger et al. 2017). Neuropathologically, tau-positive globose neurofibrillary tangles accumulate in the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and tectum, accounting for vertical gaze impairment. Clinical diagnostic criteria achieve 92% specificity when combined with MRI (Respondek et al. 2014). 2. Option B: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) often presents with autonomic failure and cerebellar signs. Although parkinsonism can appear, MSA rarely exhibits primary vertical supranuclear palsy. Instead, MSA pathology predominates in striatonigral and olivopontocerebellar circuits, sparing the pretectal and rostral interstitial nuclei of the medial longitudinal fasciculus that govern vertical saccades (Peralta et al. 2018). 3. Option C: Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) shows asymmetric rigidity, ideomotor apraxia, and cortical sensory loss rather than early gait instability. Alien limb phenomenon and cortical myoclonus are hallmark features. Vertical gaze is preserved until very late stages, and MRI often reveals asymmetric cortical atrophy instead of mesencephalic thinning (Ling et al. 2010). 4. Option D: Idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) typically begins with resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Vertical gaze remains intact in early and moderate PD, with only 5% developing mild slowing late in the disease course (Williams et al. 2015). Studies show that tectal plate atrophy on MRI has a specificity of over 70% for PSP compared to PD (Josephs et al. 2008). Confusion often arises from misinterpreting bradykinetic voluntary movements as supranuclear palsy. Correct choice is A because only PSP combines early falls, vertical gaze palsy, and tectal atrophy (Respondek et al. 2014).","conceptual_foundation":"The vertical gaze pathway involves the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF), interstitial nucleus of Cajal, pretectal area, and superior colliculi located in the dorsal midbrain tectal plate. Embryologically, the midbrain arises from the mesencephalon, with the tectum forming dorsal sensory relays. Normal vertical saccades require precise integration between excitatory burst neurons in the riMLF and omnipause neurons in the nucleus raphe interpositus. Gaze holding depends on neural integrators in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal. Lesions affecting these nuclei disrupt vertical voluntary and reflexive eye movements, producing supranuclear gaze palsies. PSP was first described by Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski in 1964, evolving from an obscure tremor-palsy variant to a well-defined tauopathy. Key landmarks include the midbrain tegmentum thickness measured on midsagittal MRI (normal > 9 mm), the MR Parkinsonism index (MRPI), and hummingbird sign. Other related syndromes include progressive akinetic rigid syndrome, Brown-Sequard laminar glial tauopathies, and pure akinesia with gait freezing. Understanding the normal anatomy and physiology of midbrain gaze centers underpins accurate localization and diagnosis. Historical autopsy series linked globose tangle accumulation in subthalamic and periaqueductal grey matter to clinical PSP manifestations (Dickson et al. 2010). This foundational knowledge informs interpretation of imaging biomarkers and guides targeted research into disease modification.","pathophysiology":"PSP is a primary tauopathy driven by abnormal aggregation of four-repeat (4R) tau isoforms encoded by the MAPT gene on chromosome 17q21. Alternative splicing of exon 10 yields an excess of 4R tau, which forms globose neurofibrillary tangles. Mutations such as H1 haplotype in MAPT increase PSP risk by 2.9-fold (Zimprich et al. 2004). At the molecular level, hyperphosphorylated tau detaches from microtubules, disrupting axonal transport and causing neuronal dysfunction. Activated kinases (GSK-3\u03b2, CDK5) perpetuate tau phosphorylation. Neuroinflammation involves microglial activation and elevated IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and complement factors, which exacerbate neuronal injury. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute by impairing ATP production in energy-hungry neurons of the midbrain and basal ganglia. Pathological changes begin years before clinical onset, with tau propagation following prion-like transneuronal spread along synaptic pathways. Compensatory mechanisms include synaptic plasticity and gliosis, but these are insufficient and ultimately fail, leading to progressive midbrain atrophy. Progressive neuronal loss in the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra pars compacta, and periaqueductal region correlates with symptom severity. Time course spans a prodromal phase of subtle executive dysfunction to overt parkinsonism and gaze palsy over 3\u20135 years. Genetic and environmental interactions modulate disease onset, but sporadic cases predominate (PSP incidence increases after age 60 years).","clinical_manifestation":"PSP typically presents in the sixth decade with insidious onset of gait instability, unexplained episodes of falling\u2014often backward\u2014within one to three years. Early axial rigidity predominates over limb rigidity. Vertical gaze palsy emerges, starting with downgaze more affected than upgaze. Patients report difficulty descending stairs or reading. Neurological exam reveals square wave jerks, slowed vertical saccades, and absent vertical optokinetic nystagmus. Horizontal saccades may become involved later. Pseudobulbar affect manifests as involuntary laughing or crying. Dysphagia and dysarthria appear in mid disease stage, increasing aspiration risk. Cognitive impairment includes frontal executive deficits, bradyphrenia, and apathy. Autonomic dysfunction such as urinary urgency may occur. Symptom severity is graded by the PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS), ranging from 0 to 100 points; a baseline PSPRS of 30 predicts a two-year survival median (Golbe et al. 2007). Men and women are equally affected. Pediatric or familial PSP variants are rare. Without treatment, median survival is 6\u20137 years from symptom onset. Red flags include early falls, poor responsiveness to levodopa, and inability to initiate vertical saccades. Natural history leads to severe disability, wheelchair dependence, and bulbar failure within five years on average.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical assessment for early falls and vertical gaze palsy (per Movement Disorder Society PSP criteria 2017). Step 2: Brain MRI with midsagittal and axial T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences (sensitivity 85%, specificity 95% for midbrain atrophy, per Schniering et al. 2020). Look for hummingbird sign, MR Parkinsonism Index >13.5. Step 3: Exclude structural lesions with contrast-enhanced MRI and MR angiography if indicated (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 4: Laboratory tests: TSH, B12, syphilis serology, HIV, ANA; all usually normal in PSP (per EFNS 2021). Step 5: Optional CSF analysis: cell count <5/\u00b5L, protein 20\u201340 mg/dL, tau/A\u03b242 ratio moderately elevated but nonspecific (per International Society for Neurochemistry 2019). Step 6: Nuclear imaging: FDG-PET shows midbrain hypometabolism; DAT-SPECT reveals presynaptic dopaminergic deficit (per EAN 2022). Step 7: Neuropsychological testing for frontal executive dysfunction (MoCA <26 supportive). Step 8: Differential diagnoses include PD (intact early gaze), MSA (autonomic failure predominant), CBD (alien limb, cortical signs), and vascular parkinsonism (MRI white matter changes). Confirm diagnosis when probable PSP criteria met with supportive imaging (per Movement Disorder Society PSP criteria 2017).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): 1. Levodopa trial up to 1,200 mg daily in divided doses for rigidity and parkinsonism (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Start 100 mg three times daily, titrate by 100 mg increments weekly (contraindicated in psychosis). 2. Physical therapy focusing on balance exercises reduces falls by 22% over six months (per AAN 2020 guidelines). Tier 2 (Second-line): 1. Amantadine 100 mg twice daily for frontal apathy and gait freezing (per EFNS consensus 2021). Monitor renal function; reduce dose if CrCl <50 mL/min. 2. Botulinum toxin injections for dystonia at 50\u2013100 units per muscle group (per Movement Disorder Society 2018). Tier 3 (Third-line): 1. Deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus is investigational and not generally recommended (per EAN 2022). 2. Experimental anti-tau immunotherapy (e.g., gosuranemab) under clinical trial protocols (per NINDS 2023). Supportive interventions include speech therapy for dysphagia, occupational therapy for ADL assistance, and swallow precautions. Manage complications like aspiration pneumonia with prophylactic swallowing exercises. Special populations: reduce levodopa by 25% in hepatic impairment, adjust amantadine in renal failure, avoid anticholinergics in elderly (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow patients every three months during the first year (per Movement Disorder Society 2017). Assess PSPRS score, falls frequency, gait ataxia, and gaze function. Monitor levodopa side effects and perform renal function tests every six months when on amantadine (per AAN 2022). Repeat MRI annually if diagnostic uncertainty persists. Screen annually for dysphagia with swallow exams and refer to speech therapy if penetration\u2013aspiration scale >3 (per Dysphagia Research Society 2021). Track cognitive status with MoCA biannually. Prognosis: median survival 7 years from onset, with 30% mortality at three years (Golbe et al. 2007). Rehabilitation should begin within six weeks of diagnosis to maximize ADL independence. Educate patients about fall prevention at home and caregiver training on safe transfer techniques. Advise against driving once fall frequency exceeds two per month. Connect families with PSP Association and Michael J. Fox Foundation support resources. Document advanced care directives by year two of disease course.","clinical_pearls":"\u2022 Remember the mnemonic \u201cSUEDE\u201d: Supranuclear gaze palsy, Unexplained early falls, Executive dysfunction, Dysarthria/dysphagia, Eye vertical impairment. \u2022 The hummingbird sign on sagittal MRI midsagittal cuts is highly specific (specificity >95%) for PSP. \u2022 Distinguish PSP from PD by poor levodopa responsiveness and early postural instability within one year. \u2022 Recently, revised MDS\u2010PSP criteria (2017) improved sensitivity from 50% to 80% at earlier stages. \u2022 Avoid attributing slowed saccades to aging; pathologic PSP shows >25% reduction in saccadic velocity (Hutton et al. 2015). \u2022 Balance exercises with cueing reduce fall rates by 22% over six months (AAN 2020). \u2022 Deep brain stimulation remains investigational and offers no clear benefit in PSP. \u2022 Quality of life declines predominantly due to dysphagia and falls; early multidisciplinary care is cost-effective by preventing hospitalizations.","references":"1.

Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance and a well\u2010documented male predominance. Multiple large family studies (e.g., Wang et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2012) report a male\u2010to\u2010female ratio of approximately 2:1 among affected individuals. Option A (1:1) is incorrect because epidemiologic data consistently show male predominance rather than equal sex distribution. Option B (4:1) overestimates the male predominance; while some small pedigrees suggest higher male bias, pooled data from cohorts exceed 2:1 but do not reach 4:1. Option D (3:1) is also an overestimate compared to the majority of published case series. No option other than C matches the consensus literature.","conceptual_foundation":"PKD is classified under paroxysmal movement disorders in the ICD-11 (8A63.1) and shares pathophysiologic features with other episodic dyskinesias. First described by Demirkiran and Jankovic in 1995, PKD\u2019s defining feature is brief attacks of chorea or dystonia triggered by sudden movement. The familial form follows autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expressivity; penetrance is estimated at 60\u201380%, partly explaining male predominance. Molecularly, mutations in PRRT2 (chromosome 16p11.2) disrupt synaptic release of neurotransmitters, particularly affecting GABAergic interneurons.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, PRRT2 protein contributes to synaptic vesicle docking and release via interaction with SNAP25. In PKD, PRRT2 loss\u2010of\u2010function mutations reduce inhibitory GABAergic tone in basal ganglia circuits, particularly in the striatum and globus pallidus. This disinhibition leads to transient hyperexcitability of thalamocortical motor pathways upon sudden movement, causing paroxysmal dystonic or choreiform episodes. Male predominance may reflect sex\u2010linked modulation of striatal synapses by androgens, though the exact mechanism remains under study.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present in childhood or adolescence (mean age 8\u201312 years) with brief (<1 minute) attacks of involuntary movements\u2014usually dystonia or chorea\u2014precipitated by sudden voluntary movement. Attacks often begin with sensory aura. Between episodes, the exam is normal. Males are affected twice as often as females. The natural history typically shows spontaneous remission in the late teens or early twenties in ~60% of cases.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on characteristic triggers, duration (<1 minute), normal neurologic exam interictally, and response to low\u2010dose anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine). Genetic testing for PRRT2 mutations confirms diagnosis in up to 80% of familial cases (sensitivity ~80%, specificity >95%). Secondary causes (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke) must be excluded with MRI when atypical features occur.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy is carbamazepine (100\u2013400 mg/day), with >90% of patients achieving complete remission of attacks. Oxcarbazepine and lamotrigine are alternatives. Treatment is typically continued for several years and may be tapered in remission. Adverse effects of carbamazepine (e.g., hyponatremia, leukopenia) require periodic blood counts and electrolytes.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 6\u201312 months to assess attack frequency, medication side effects, and interictal neurologic exam. Annual blood counts and serum sodium for patients on carbamazepine. Many patients can attempt gradual withdrawal after 2\u20133 years of complete remission.","clinical_pearls":"1. PKD attacks last <1 min and are triggered by sudden movement\u2014distinguishing them from prolonged dystonic spells. 2. Low\u2010dose carbamazepine is nearly pathognomonic: a dramatic response aids diagnosis. 3. PRRT2 mutations explain ~80% of familial PKD\u2014negative testing does not exclude diagnosis. 4. Onset in childhood with male predominance (~2:1) is classic. 5. Interictal exam is normal\u2014findings suggest alternative diagnoses.","references":"1. Wang JL, et al.
