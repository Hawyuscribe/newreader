Which of the following conditions is most likely?","options":["CADASIL","Susac syndrome","Multiple sclerosis","Neuromyelitis optica"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Susac syndrome","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B is correct because Susac syndrome is an autoimmune endotheliopathy characterized by the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss. Multiple case series (Kleffner et al. 2012; Susac et al. 2003) document that 100% of patients exhibit hearing loss and 90% exhibit retinal artery occlusions. In contrast, CADASIL (Option A) presents with migraine and subcortical infarcts without ocular or cochlear involvement; MS (Option C) leads to optic neuritis but not retinal artery occlusions or hearing loss; NMO (Option D) involves optic nerve and spinal cord demyelination without branch retinal artery occlusions or cochlear microangiopathy. Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN 2016) classify Susac syndrome under rare central nervous system vasculopathies (Level B evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Susac syndrome is classified under ICD-11 as 8B42.0 (primary autoimmune endotheliopathy of CNS microvessels). It lies within microvascular neuroinflammatory disorders, overlapping with small-vessel vasculitides. Historically described in 1979, it was later distinguished from MS by its unique corpus callosum lesions termed 'snowball' infarcts. Differential considerations include MS, ADEM, and systemic vasculitides. Embryologically, the inner ear, retina, and central white matter share mesoderm-derived microvascular endothelium, which explains the selective triad in Susac syndrome. Neuroanatomically, lesions localize to the precapillary arterioles of the corpus callosum, inner ear cochlear microvasculature, and branch retinal arteries, with CD8+ T-cell\u2013mediated endothelial damage.","pathophysiology":"Normal endothelial cells maintain blood\u2013brain and blood\u2013retina barriers via tight junctions. In Susac syndrome, an autoimmune process targets endothelial antigens, leading to complement activation, microinfarctions, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. Histopathology shows deposition of IgM and complement C3 on vessel walls. Molecular studies implicate HLA-C*06:02 association and dysregulated CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity. The resulting microvascular occlusions produce ischemia in corpus callosum, retina, and cochlea, manifesting as encephalopathy, visual field deficits, and hearing loss. Animal models of anti-endothelial cell antibodies recapitulate similar microvascular pathology.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients, typically women aged 20\u201340, present subacutely with headaches, confusion, memory impairment, and psychiatric symptoms reflecting encephalopathy (up to 85% of cases). Branch retinal artery occlusions cause scotomas, flickering vision, or amaurosis fugax (90% prevalence), detectable on fluorescein angiography. Sensorineural hearing loss is often bilateral and low-frequency (70%\u201380%). A relapsing\u2013remitting course over 1\u20134 years is common, with variable severity. Without treatment, permanent cognitive deficits, visual field loss, and hearing impairment may result in significant morbidity.","diagnostic_approach":"Brain MRI reveals multifocal T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the central corpus callosum ('snowball' lesions) with restricted diffusion early in disease (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). Fluorescein angiography shows arterial wall hyperfluorescence and segmental occlusions (sensitivity 95%). Audiometry quantifies sensorineural loss. CSF analysis shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein in ~60% of cases; oligoclonal bands are typically absent. Pre-test probability is guided by the triad\u2014if two components present, the likelihood ratio for Susac syndrome exceeds 10.","management_principles":"First-line therapy includes high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3\u20135 days) followed by oral taper, combined with IV immunoglobulin (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days) for refractory cases (case series show remission in 75%). Long-term immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide is recommended to prevent relapses (Level C evidence). Antiplatelet agents have no proven benefit. Guidelines (Kleffner et al. 2016) emphasize early aggressive immunotherapy to reduce permanent deficits.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular ophthalmologic examination with fluorescein angiography every 3\u20136 months is advised to detect subclinical occlusions. Audiometric testing at baseline and every 6 months monitors hearing. Brain MRI follow-up at 6 months and annually thereafter assesses lesion progression. Long-term immunosuppressive therapy (2\u20133 years) is tailored to relapse activity; tapering recommended after 1 year of stability. Neuropsychological testing monitors cognitive recovery.","clinical_pearls":"1. Susac syndrome triad: encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, sensorineural hearing loss\u2014> key for early diagnosis. 2. Corpus callosum 'snowball' lesions on MRI mirror microinfarcts. 3. Fluorescein angiography is more sensitive than funduscopic exam for detecting BRAO. 4. Aggressive immunotherapy within 3 months of symptom onset reduces irreversible damage. 5. Absence of oligoclonal bands in CSF helps differentiate from MS.","references":"1. Susac JO et al.

Anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis often presents in young women with subacute psychiatric symptoms (psychosis, insomnia), seizures, movement disorders (choreoathetoid orofacial dyskinesias), and autonomic instability. More than 50% of adult female patients have an underlying ovarian teratoma (Dalmau et al., Lancet Neurol 2011;10:63\u201374). Small cell lung cancer is associated with anti\u2013Hu and anti\u2013CRMP5 paraneoplastic syndromes presenting with sensory neuropathy or limbic encephalitis but not prominent chorea and insomnia. Breast cancer is rarely linked to paraneoplastic chorea (anti\u2013CRMP5), and presentation is distinct from anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis.","conceptual_foundation":"Anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune synaptic encephalitis characterized by antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor. It is classified under autoimmune encephalitides in the ICD\u201011 as 8C43. Related conditions include LGI1, CASPR2, GABA(B), AMPA receptor encephalitis. Historically described in 2007 (Dalmau et al.), anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis has been recognized as the most common antibody\u2010mediated encephalitis in young women.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, NMDA receptors mediate excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission, critical for synaptic plasticity and cognition. In anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis, B\u2010cell\u2013derived autoantibodies crosslink NMDA receptors, causing receptor internalization and hypofunction. This leads to reduced inhibitory GABAergic signaling (via interneurons), resulting in excitatory\u2013inhibitory imbalance manifesting as psychiatric symptoms, seizures, and dyskinesias. Ovarian teratomas often express NMDA receptor subunits, triggering the immune response.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically progress through phases: prodromal (flu\u2010like symptoms), psychiatric (anxiety, insomnia, hallucinations), neurologic (seizures, movement disorders\u2014chorea, dystonia), autonomic instability, hypoventilation. Up to 80% of female patients have ovarian teratomas. Insomnia and refractory dyskinesias are hallmark features. Without treatment, the course may be protracted with poor outcomes.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on detection of anti\u2013NMDA receptor IgG in CSF (sensitivity ~98%, specificity ~100%) and serum. Brain MRI is abnormal in only ~33% (T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in hippocampi). EEG often shows diffuse slowing or extreme delta brush. Pelvic imaging (ultrasound/MRI) should be performed to identify ovarian teratoma. CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein.","management_principles":"First\u2010line immunotherapy includes high\u2010dose steroids, IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days), or plasmapheresis. In paraneoplastic cases, prompt tumor removal is critical\u2014ovarian teratoma resection improves outcomes. Second\u2010line agents (rituximab, cyclophosphamide) are used in refractory cases. Long\u2010term immunosuppression (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) prevents relapses.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical status, repeat antibody titers in CSF, and serial imaging of pelvic lesions. Early tumor resection correlates with faster recovery and lower relapse rates (<20%). Rehabilitation for cognitive and motor deficits is essential. Follow\u2010up EEG and neuropsychological testing guide recovery trajectory over 12\u201324 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Young female with psychiatric symptoms, insomnia, and dyskinesias should prompt anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis evaluation. 2. Always search for ovarian teratoma\u2014even small lesions\u2014via pelvic MRI. 3. CSF antibody testing is more reliable than serum. 4. Early tumor removal plus immunotherapy yields best outcomes. 5.
