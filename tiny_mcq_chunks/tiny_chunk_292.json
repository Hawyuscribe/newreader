[{"question_number":"6","question":"In a patient with a familial history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which gene mutations are commonly associated?","options":["SOD1","C9orf72"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"C9orf72","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B (C9orf72) is the most common genetic cause of familial ALS, representing approximately 40% of familial cases, while SOD1 accounts for about 20%. Multiple studies, including Renton et al. 2011 and Majounie et al. 2012, support C9orf72 as the predominant mutation. Option A (SOD1) is indeed implicated but less frequent in comparison.","conceptual_foundation":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is classified under motor neuron diseases (ICD-11 code 8A60) and involves progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Familial ALS comprises about 10% of all cases and is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Historically, SOD1 was the first gene identified in 1993 (Rosen et al.), followed by C9orf72 in 2011 (Renton et al.), marking a shift in understanding of genetic contributions. Embryologically, motor neurons derive from the basal plate of the neural tube, with subsequent maturation influenced by neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and GDNF.","pathophysiology":"Normal C9orf72 protein participates in endosomal trafficking and autophagy. Hexanucleotide repeat expansions lead to formation of toxic RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins that disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport, induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, and promote excitotoxicity. SOD1 mutations cause protein misfolding, aggregate formation, and oxidative stress. Neuronal death occurs particularly in Betz cells of the motor cortex, brainstem motor nuclei, and anterior horn cells of the spinal cord.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in mid-adulthood with progressive asymmetric limb weakness, muscle atrophy, fasciculations, spasticity, and hyperreflexia. Bulbar onset involves dysarthria and dysphagia. C9orf72 expansions are often associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in approximately 15% of cases. Median survival is 2\u20135 years post-diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is based on the revised El Escorial criteria requiring evidence of upper and lower motor neuron degeneration in multiple body regions. In familial cases, genetic testing for C9orf72 repeat expansions (repeat-primed PCR) and SOD1 sequencing is recommended (AAN Guidelines 2020, Class I evidence). Electromyography shows widespread denervation and reinnervation changes.","management_principles":"Riluzole (50 mg twice daily) extends survival by approximately 2\u20133 months (Miller et al. 2007, N Engl J Med). Edaravone slows functional decline in a subset of patients. Multidisciplinary care\u2014including respiratory support, nutritional management, and physical therapy\u2014improves quality of life. Experimental approaches include antisense oligonucleotides targeting SOD1 and C9orf72.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor respiratory function (forced vital capacity every 3 months), nutritional status (weight, BMI), and functional scales (ALSFRS-R) at regular intervals. Adjust noninvasive ventilation and enteral feeding based on declining metrics. Early palliative care referral optimizes symptom control and advance care planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. C9orf72 expansions can present with behavioral variant FTD; 2. SOD1 mutations often lead to a more rapid disease course; 3. Riluzole remains the only therapy proven to prolong survival; 4. Multidisciplinary clinics reduce hospitalization and improve quality of life; 5. Genetic counseling is essential for familial cases.","references":"1. Renton AE et al.

Evidence from multiple cohort studies demonstrates that reduced FVC (<\u200950% predicted) correlates with impending respiratory failure in ALS and guides initiation of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (Andersen 2012; Bourke 2006). Methylphenidate (B) is occasionally used off-label to treat fatigue but without first excluding treatable causes. Depression (C) can contribute to fatigue, but mood assessment should follow objective respiratory evaluation. Nocturnal oximetry (D) may detect desaturations, but formal PFTs provide more comprehensive data, including vital capacity and inspiratory pressures, and their decline predicts prognosis. A 2018 AAN guideline (Level B evidence) recommends routine PFTs at diagnosis and every 3\u20136 months thereafter.","conceptual_foundation":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a motor neuron disease affecting upper and lower motor neurons leading to progressive weakness and bulbar involvement. Fatigue in ALS can be multifactorial: respiratory muscle weakness, sleep-disordered breathing, nutritional deficiencies, depression, and medications. Respiratory muscle involvement manifests as reduced FVC. Early detection of respiratory decline is critical because timely NIV improves quality of life and survival by about 7\u20139 months (Bourke et al. 2006). Understanding ALS pathophysiology indicates that diaphragmatic weakness is among the earliest causes of dyspnea and fatigue; therefore, PFTs are foundational in the diagnostic algorithm.","pathophysiology":"In ALS, degeneration of phrenic motor neurons and cervical spinal motor neurons reduces diaphragm and accessory muscle strength. Reduced inspiratory muscle strength leads to hypoventilation, particularly during sleep, causing hypercapnia and fatigue. FVC correlates directly with respiratory muscle strength and is a surrogate marker for alveolar ventilation adequacy. As motor neuron loss progresses, compensatory hyperventilation fails, leading to early morning headaches and daytime somnolence.","clinical_manifestation":"Respiratory muscle weakness in ALS presents as orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, morning headaches, daytime somnolence, and fatigue. Objective PFT changes precede overt clinical symptoms. FVC <\u200980% predicted indicates mild impairment; <\u200950% indicates moderate-to-severe impairment and need for NIV evaluation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation: Spirometry measuring FVC, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure. Sensitivity of FVC <\u200980% for detecting respiratory involvement in early ALS is ~85%. Second-tier: full polysomnography if nocturnal hypoventilation suspected. Nocturnal oximetry alone has lower sensitivity (~60%) for early hypoventilation.","management_principles":"When FVC <\u200950% predicted or SNIP <\u200940 cm H\u2082O, initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) per AAN (2018) Class IIb recommendation.

Methylphenidate may be considered for refractory fatigue (off-label), but only after confirming respiratory causes are addressed.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat PFTs every 3 months or sooner if symptoms worsen.

A negative anesthetic history does not rule out malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS). Clinical series report up to 30 percent of genetically susceptible individuals never manifest an MH crisis until exposed to triggering agents. In one cohort of RYR1 mutation carriers, 25 percent experienced normal anesthesia uneventfully yet developed fulminant MH on subsequent exposures. Relying solely on prior tolerance can lead to catastrophic underestimation of risk. Common misconception: absence of past events equals absence of risk. Option B \u2013 \u201cHe still has the risk.\u201d This is correct and recommended by current guidelines (North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry, 2020). A first- or second-degree relative with MH strongly elevates pretest probability. Genetic and in vitro contracture testing (IVCT) studies show 40\u201360 percent concordance of family members harboring the same mutation. This statement balances that risk exists without exaggeration. Option C \u2013 \u201cHe is at high risk.\u201d This overstates relative susceptibility. His risk is elevated compared to general population (<1 in 100 000 anesthetics), but less than a symptomatic MH survivor (approximately 70 percent recurrence risk). Misclassifying risk as \u201chigh\u201d may provoke unnecessary anxiety and overuse of dantrolene prophylaxis. Using precise language as in Option B aligns with practice parameters and reduces patient confusion. ","conceptual_foundation":"Skeletal muscle excitation\u2013contraction coupling depends on coordinated architecture of transverse (T) tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR, L-type Ca2+ channel) resides in the T-tubule membrane, mechanically linked to the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) on the junctional SR. Embryologically, myogenic precursor cells from somites differentiate under MyoD and Myf5 transcription factors into myoblasts, fusing to form multinucleated myotubes. Type I (slow-twitch) and type II (fast-twitch) fiber distinction emerges from differential innervation and perinatal gene expression. In normal physiology, depolarization triggers Ca2+ release via RyR1, enabling actin\u2013myosin interaction. Divalent cation homeostasis and ATP-consuming Ca2+ reuptake by SERCA pumps restore resting state. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) often involves sarcoglycan or calpain mutations, weakening membrane integrity but not directly altering RyR1. However, some LGMD subtypes may co-segregate with RYR1 variants. Historically, Denborough and Lovell\u2019s 1960s case series first linked anesthetic-induced hyperthermia to muscle calcium dysregulation. Landmark animal studies in swine (1975) elucidated halothane-triggered RyR1 gating defects, leading to modern contracture assays and genetic screening protocols. Anatomical landmarks\u2014the deltoid and quadriceps muscle biopsy sites\u2014are critical for IVCT sampling. Knowledge of T-tubule\u2013SR junctions and myofiber subtypes informs understanding of both LGMD and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.","pathophysiology":"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) arises from uncontrolled Ca2+ release through dysfunctional RyR1 channels in skeletal muscle. In susceptible individuals, triggering agents such as volatile anesthetics (e.g., sevoflurane, desflurane) or depolarizing neuromuscular blockers (succinylcholine, 1\u20131.5 mg/kg) lower the activation threshold of RyR1. Mutations in RYR1 (chromosome 19q13.2) or CACNA1S (chromosome 1q32) cause leaky channels or hypersensitivity. The intracellular Ca2+ surge activates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and phospholipase A2, generating reactive oxygen species and heat. ATP depletion impairs SERCA pump function, prolonging cytosolic Ca2+. Resultant sustained actin\u2013myosin interaction produces muscle rigidity and rapid thermogenesis, raising core temperature by up to 1\u20132 \u00b0C every 5 minutes. Secondary metabolic processes include lactic acidosis (arterial pH may drop to 7.0 within 20 minutes), hyperkalemia (up to 6.5 mEq/L within 30 minutes), rhabdomyolysis with CK levels exceeding 100 000 U/L, and disseminated intravascular coagulation from tissue factor release. Time course: onset typically within 10\u201320 minutes of exposure but can be delayed up to 2 hours post-induction. Compensatory vasodilation and sweating are often insufficient to dissipate the endogenously generated heat, leading to end-organ damage without timely intervention. In LGMD patients, baseline sarcolemmal fragility may magnify contracture severity once RyR1 is activated.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset usually begins with unexplained tachycardia (heart rate >120 beats/min) and hypercapnia \u2013 end-tidal CO2 may rise from 40 to >80 mmHg despite unchanged minute ventilation. Within 5\u201310 minutes, generalized muscle rigidity appears, first noted in masseter muscles (\u201cjaw lock\u201d) in 40 percent of cases. Core temperature escalates by 1\u20132 \u00b0C every 5\u201310 minutes, often exceeding 40 \u00b0C within 15\u201320 minutes. Early metabolic acidosis (arterial pH falls to 7.1\u20137.2) is accompanied by mixed respiratory acidosis from hypoventilation. Sweating, mottling, and cyanosis signal impending cardiovascular collapse. Lab markers: CK levels rise above 10 000 U/L as rhabdomyolysis ensues; serum potassium peaks at 6.0\u20137.0 mEq/L, risking ventricular arrhythmias. In pediatric patients, baseline metabolic rates and muscle mass proportions may accelerate progression. Elderly individuals can present more insidiously with isolated tachycardia and acidosis. Red flags: sudden increase in oxygen consumption, unexplained hyperthermia, refractory acidosis, coagulopathy within hours. Without intervention, complications include acute renal failure (incidence 30 percent), disseminated intravascular coagulation (20 percent), and mortality rates up to 70 percent historically, now reduced below 5 percent with dantrolene therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial suspicion arises intraoperatively with unexplained hypercapnia and tachycardia. Step 1: exclude other causes (thyroid storm, sepsis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome) through clinical context. Step 2: measure arterial blood gases (pH <7.2, PaCO2 >60 mmHg), serum electrolytes (K+ >6 mEq/L), CK (baseline vs post-crisis), creatinine, coagulation profile. Step 3: perform caffeine-halothane contracture test (CHCT) on fresh muscle biopsy samples from vastus lateralis; sensitivity 97 percent, specificity 78 percent. Positive CHCT confirms MHS per European MH Group criteria. Step 4: genetic testing for RYR1 and CACNA1S variants; yields pathogenic mutations in ~50 percent of MH families. Negative genetic test does not exclude susceptibility. Imaging is generally not diagnostic but chest radiograph may rule out pulmonary embolism in differential. Electromyography in LGMD shows myopathic changes (short-duration, low-amplitude motor unit potentials) helping distinguish dystrophy subtypes. Differential includes exertional heat stroke (history of exercise), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (neuroleptic exposure), and thyroid storm (labile thyroid function tests). Family screening via genetic counseling is mandated if MHS confirmed.","management_principles":"Immediate management: discontinue triggering agents, hyperventilate with 100 percent O2 at 10\u201315 L/min, active cooling (ice packs, cooling blankets), hyperventilation. Administer dantrolene sodium IV: initial loading dose 2.5 mg/kg bolus, repeat every 5 minutes until rigidity resolves or dose reaches 10 mg/kg. Maintenance infusion: 1 mg/kg every 4\u20136 hours for 24\u201348 hours to prevent recrudescence. Dantrolene incompatibilities: avoid calcium channel blockers (risk of hyperkalemia, myocardial depression); monitor liver enzymes (AST/ALT baseline and daily). Treat metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate (1\u20132 mEq/kg). Manage hyperkalemia: insulin 0.1 U/kg + 0.5 g/kg dextrose, nebulized albuterol, calcium gluconate 10 mL of 10 percent solution. Maintain urine output >2 mL/kg/hr; consider mannitol 0.5\u20131 g/kg IV if oliguria. Non-pharmacological: active external cooling, cold saline gastric lavage. In LGMD patients, neuromuscular blockers should be non-depolarizing agents (e.g., rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg), and total intravenous anesthesia (propofol infusion 100\u2013200 \u00b5g/kg/min) preferred. Preoperative prep includes dantrolene availability and MH cart readiness.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-crisis monitoring in ICU for at least 48 hours: continuous core temperature, end-tidal CO2, electrolytes every 4 hours for first 24 hours. CK and renal function daily until values normalize. Arrange genetic counseling within 1 week; perform family pedigree analysis and offer genetic testing to first-degree relatives. Advise outpatient anesthesia consultation prior to any future procedures; MH-safe anesthesia protocols should be documented in electronic medical record. Long-term, check for late renal impairment (serum creatinine at 1 month, 6 months). Physical therapy for rhabdomyolysis sequelae and LGMD-related weakness per rehabilitation guidelines\u20143 sessions/week for 6 weeks. Prognosis: with timely dantrolene, 1-year survival exceeds 95 percent; risk of recurrent episodes remains until proven negative by IVCT or genetic negativity. Educate patient about medical alert bracelet indicating MH susceptibility. Recommend registration with Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) and support groups for ongoing resources.","clinical_pearls":"1. MH can present with isolated hypercapnia before hyperthermia; monitor end-tidal CO2 closely. 2. The \u2018caffeine-halothane contracture test\u2019 remains diagnostic gold standard (sensitivity 97 percent). 3. Dantrolene is the only specific antidote; keep at least 36 vials ready per operating suite. 4. Succinycholine triggers MH in 70\u201380 percent of crises; use non-depolarizing blockers in susceptible patients. 5.

Which nerve is likely affected?","options":["PIN","Radial ## Page 7"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"PIN","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: PIN (posterior interosseous nerve). The PIN is the purely motor branch of the radial nerve after it passes through the supinator muscle. Because it carries no cutaneous sensory fibers, an isolated lesion of the PIN produces weakness of wrist and finger extension without any sensory loss. Option B (radial nerve) is incorrect because a lesion of the radial nerve proximal to the branch point for the PIN would produce both motor deficits (wrist/finger drop) and sensory loss over the dorsum of the hand and forearm. PIN lesions have been well characterized in clinical series (e.g., Spinner RJ et al., J Hand Surg 1998), showing preserved sensation in 100% of cases.","conceptual_foundation":"The radial nerve arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (C5\u2013T1) and travels in the spiral groove of the humerus. Before winding around the lateral epicondyle, it gives off the superficial branch (sensory) and deep branch (motor). The deep branch pierces the supinator to become the PIN. In ICD-11, radial neuropathies are classified under GB90. Related conditions include radial tunnel syndrome (entrapped deep branch) and lateral epicondylitis (mimics PIN compression). Embryologically, the radial nerve derives from neural crest cells, and the extensor musculature develops from the dorsal mass of the limb bud mesenchyme under the influence of HOX gene expression.","pathophysiology":"Normal wrist and finger extension rely on intact innervation of the extensor carpi radialis longus/brevis, extensor digitorum communis, and extensor indicis by the PIN. Compression of the PIN within the supinator canal (Arcade of Frohse) leads to focal demyelination, conduction block, and eventual axonal degeneration if chronic. This results in selective weakness of extension without sensory changes. In contrast, proximal radial nerve lesions involve Wallerian degeneration affecting both superficial and deep branches.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PIN palsy present with wrist drop, difficulty extending the metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers, and inability to perform thumb extension (EPL) or ulnar deviation (ECU). They have preserved sensation over the radial dorsum of the hand and forearm. Electromyography (EMG) shows denervation potentials in PIN-innervated muscles but normal sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs). The natural history without treatment may include persistent pinch weakness and functional limitation, though many cases improve with conservative management over 3\u20136 months.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes a careful clinical exam confirming isolated motor deficit without sensory loss, and EMG/NCS demonstrating reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in PIN-innervated muscles with preserved SNAPs. Ultrasound or MRI may show nerve swelling at the supinator canal. Second-tier testing (MRI neurography) can localize entrapment. Third-tier studies, such as intraoperative nerve conduction mapping, are reserved for refractory cases. Pre-test probability is high when finger/wrist extension is weak with intact sensation.","management_principles":"Conservative management is first-line: rest, NSAIDs, wrist splinting, and physical therapy focusing on stretching the supinator and strengthening extensors. Class II evidence (Spinner 1998) supports a 70% rate of full recovery at 6 months. Surgical decompression is considered for cases with no improvement after 3\u20136 months or significant weakness, with reported success rates of 80% (Level B evidence).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be re-evaluated clinically and electrophysiologically at 3-month intervals. Persistent CMAP reduction at 6 months warrants surgical referral. Splinting and therapy continue until functional recovery plateaus. Long-term prognosis is excellent if decompression occurs before irreversible axonal loss.","clinical_pearls":"1. PIN palsy causes motor weakness without sensory loss\u2014key for localization.\n2.
