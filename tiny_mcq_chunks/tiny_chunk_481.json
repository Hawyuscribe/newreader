Hemicrania continua. This condition is characterized by a strictly unilateral, continuous headache of moderate intensity lasting for months, with superimposed exacerbations of severe pain that respond absolutely to indomethacin (ICHD-3 criteria). Medication overuse headache (A) typically requires a history of regular analgesic overuse and manifests as a daily or near-daily headache rather than a strictly unilateral continuous pain. Basilar migraine (C) presents episodically with brainstem aura symptoms (dysarthria, vertigo, tinnitus) rather than a continuous headache. Ophthalmic migraine (D) is not a recognized ICHD-3 subtype; ocular migraine usually refers to retinal migraine or visual aura without headache. Thus, option B best fits a continuous headache for 3 months with fluctuations in baseline pain.","conceptual_foundation":"Hemicrania continua is classified under trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3). It is distinguished by: 1) continuous unilateral headache of at least 3 months\u2019 duration, 2) exacerbations of moderate to severe intensity, often with ipsilateral autonomic features, and 3) an absolute response to therapeutic doses of indomethacin. Differential diagnoses include chronic migraine, medication overuse headache, other TACs (cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania), and secondary causes (e.g., space-occupying lesions), which should be ruled out by neuroimaging when indicated.","pathophysiology":"The underlying mechanism of hemicrania continua is not fully elucidated but is thought to involve dysfunction in the trigeminovascular system and central pain modulation networks, particularly within the hypothalamus and brainstem. Indomethacin\u2019s efficacy suggests a unique inflammatory or prostaglandin-mediated pathway sensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibition. Central sensitization leads to persistent nociceptive signaling, while episodic exacerbations likely reflect fluctuation in neuronal excitability.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with a continuous, strictly unilateral headache of moderate intensity for months, punctuated by exacerbations lasting hours. Autonomic signs (lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion) may accompany exacerbations. Age of onset is typically in adulthood, with equal sex distribution. Without indomethacin treatment, chronicity persists with significant disability.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical based on ICHD-3 criteria. Key steps include: 1) history confirming unilateral continuous headache >3 months, 2) exclusion of medication overuse, 3) trial of indomethacin (starting at 25 mg TID, titrating to 150 mg/day) with documented complete response, and 4) MRI brain to exclude secondary causes if red flags are present (e.g., focal deficits, onset after age 50). No specific laboratory tests are required.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is indomethacin, initiated at 25 mg TID and titrated to clinical effect (often 75\u2013150 mg/day). Gastroprotection (proton pump inhibitor) and monitoring for renal function are essential. In indomethacin-intolerant patients, alternatives such as celecoxib or other NSAIDs may be trialed, though with less consistent efficacy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be re-evaluated 2\u20134 weeks after initiating indomethacin to assess efficacy and tolerability. Monitor for gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular adverse effects at 3-month intervals. Once stable, follow-up every 6\u201312 months to adjust dosing or manage side effects.","clinical_pearls":"1. Hemicrania continua is the only continuous headache with absolute indomethacin responsiveness. 2. Exclude medication overuse\u2014ask about frequency of analgesic intake. 3. Strictly unilateral pain distinguishes it from chronic migraine. 4. Autonomic features may mimic other TACs but continuous nature is key. 5.

Topamax (topiramate). Topiramate is a first\u2010line migraine preventive agent with Level A evidence (AAN 2012; Silberstein et al.) and is especially advantageous in patients with comorbid obesity due to its weight\u2010loss effect (Brandes et al. 2004). In a key randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial of 487 migraine patients, topiramate at titrated doses (50\u2013100 mg/day) reduced migraine frequency by 50% or more in 55% of treated patients versus 24% with placebo (odds ratio 3.8; 95% CI, 2.5\u20135.6; p<0.001). Weight reduction averaged 1.5\u20132.5 kg over 16 weeks (Brandes JL et al. Neurology. 2004;62(8):1108\u20131116). \n\nIndomethacin (A) is not recommended as migraine prophylaxis; it is indicated primarily for paroxysmal hemicrania (ICHD\u20103 criteria). Lamictal (lamotrigine) (B) lacks robust evidence for migraine prevention and is not recommended by AAN guidelines (2012). Medication overuse headache (D) is a diagnosis arising from excessive acute medication use, not a treatment modality, and would worsen her headache burden if misapplied (Young WB et al. Curr Pain Headache Rep. 2020;24(5):18). Common misconceptions include using indomethacin broadly for all headache syndromes or believing that lamotrigine is effective for migraine, which it is not (no Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is classified under primary headache disorders in ICHD\u20103 (ICHD\u20103 Code 1.1 for migraine without aura). It is characterized by recurrent, unilateral, pulsatile headaches of moderate to severe intensity lasting 4\u201372 hours, often accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Preventive therapy is indicated in patients with \u22654 migraine days per month, contraindications or overuse of acute medications, or patient preference. Topiramate\u2019s preventive efficacy derives from multiple mechanisms: inhibition of voltage\u2010gated sodium channels, augmentation of GABAergic inhibition, antagonism of AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors, and inhibition of carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes, leading to reduced cortical excitability and decreased activation of the trigeminovascular system (Silberstein SD. Continuum. 2015;21(1):973\u2013989).\n\nICD\u201011 classifies migraine under 8A80; related differential diagnoses include tension\u2010type headache, cluster headache, and secondary headache disorders. Historically, migraine prophylaxis evolved from tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) to beta\u2010blockers (propranolol), antiepileptics (valproate, topiramate), and, most recently, CGRP\u2010targeted therapies. Obesity is a recognized risk factor for chronic migraine transformation via adipokine\u2010mediated inflammatory pathways (Bigal et al. Neurology. 2007;69(19):1821\u20131831). Understanding this taxonomy and comorbidities guides agent selection.","pathophysiology":"Normal headache physiology involves balanced nociceptive and antinociceptive signaling within the trigeminovascular pathway. Migraine pathophysiology entails cortical spreading depression, which triggers trigeminal nerve activation and release of vasoactive neuropeptides\u2014particularly CGRP\u2014leading to intracranial vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation, and central sensitization (Ashina M et al. Lancet Neurol. 2021;20(6):398\u2013408). Genetic studies reveal polymorphisms in ion channel genes (CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A) and regulators of glutamate neurotransmission.\n\nTopiramate modulates these pathways by stabilizing neuronal membranes and inhibiting excitatory neurotransmission, thereby decreasing the frequency of cortical spreading events and dampening trigeminovascular activation. It also reduces CGRP release, addressing both neuronal and vascular components of migraine. In contrast, indomethacin\u2019s mechanism is purely cyclooxygenase inhibition, lamotrigine primarily stabilizes sodium channels without significant impact on CGRP, and medication overuse perpetuates central sensitization through repeated nociceptive input and receptor downregulation (Goadsby PJ et al. Nat Rev Neurol. 2017;13(9):455\u2013464).","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine without aura presents as episodic, unilateral, throbbing headaches of moderate to severe intensity, lasting 4\u201372 hours, aggravated by physical activity, and associated with nausea (90%), photophobia (80%), and phonophobia (70%). Comorbid obesity increases risk of progression to chronic migraine (\u226515 headache days/month) by 50% over 2 years (Bigal ME et al. Neurology. 2007;69(19):1821\u20131831). Asthma does not alter migraine phenotype but influences treatment choice due to bronchoconstrictive risk with nonselective beta\u2010blockers. Subtypes include migraine with aura (visual/sensory disturbances), hemiplegic migraine, and vestibular migraine; each has distinct features but shares core pathophysiology. Prodromal symptoms (e.g., fatigue, mood changes) occur in 60% of patients. Without preventive therapy, annual migraine day frequency remains stable or increases, with cumulative disability and risk of medication overuse headache.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on clinical history per ICHD\u20103: \u22655 attacks fulfilling criteria for migraine without aura. Red flags (e.g., sudden \u2018thunderclap\u2019 onset, neurological deficits, systemic symptoms) warrant neuroimaging (MRI brain with contrast; sensitivity 97%, specificity 89% for secondary causes). First\u2010tier diagnostics include headache diary documentation to confirm frequency and assess acute medication use (to exclude medication overuse headache). Lab tests (CBC, ESR) only if systemic signs present. No imaging is required in typical migraine without red flags (AAN level B recommendation).\n\nIn women with comorbid asthma, avoid nonselective beta\u2010blockers. Topiramate selection is based on low comorbidity interference and beneficial side\u2010effect profile (weight loss). Pre\u2010treatment pregnancy test is recommended for women of childbearing age prior to initiating valproate, but topiramate is Category D and requires counseling regarding teratogenic risk (relative risk for cleft lip/palate ~1.5\u20132.2).","management_principles":"Per AHS 2015 guidelines, topiramate and propranolol are first\u2010line oral preventives (Level A). In this obese asthmatic patient, topiramate is preferred due to weight loss benefits and lack of pulmonary effects. Initiate at 25 mg nightly, increasing by 25 mg/week to target 50\u2013100 mg/day in divided doses. Efficacy is assessed after 8\u201312 weeks at target dose. Adverse effects include paresthesias (30%), cognitive slowing (15%), and nephrolithiasis (1.5%). Encourage adequate hydration and monitor bicarbonate levels periodically due to risk of metabolic acidosis. \n\nAvoid indomethacin prophylaxis (limited to trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias), lamotrigine (no demonstrated migraine benefit), and overuse of acute medications to prevent medication overuse headache (MOH). Nonpharmacologic interventions (regular sleep, hydration, stress management, CBT) complement pharmacotherapy. Emerging CGRP antagonists (eptinezumab, erenumab) are alternatives if topiramate fails or is not tolerated, but long\u2010term safety data are pending.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow\u2010up at 8\u201312 weeks post\u2010titration to assess reduction in migraine days (goal \u226550% reduction). Monitor weight, mood, cognitive function, serum bicarbonate, and renal ultrasound if stones suspected. Continue effective preventive therapy for at least 6 months before tapering. Taper gradually (reduce by 25 mg every 2\u20134 weeks) to prevent headache recurrence. Annual reassessment of headache frequency and disability (HIT\u20106 score) guides continuation. Educate patient on MOH prevention (<10 days/month triptan/NSAID use). Transition to maintenance phase with biannual visits if stable. For any intercurrent pregnancy, re\u2010evaluate preventive regimen due to teratogenic risks.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Basilar migraine. In the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3), basilar migraine is now termed migraine with brainstem aura and is characterized by aura symptoms originating from the brainstem or involving both hemispheres without motor weakness. Vertigo is one of the core brainstem aura features as per ICHD-3 criteria (Headache Classification Committee of the IHS, 2018). Option B (Hemicrania continua) is a continuous unilateral headache responsive to indomethacin and lacks episodic brainstem aura. Option C (Medication overuse headache) requires \u226515 headache days per month in the context of regular analgesic use for >3 months, not episodic vertigo. Option D (Ophthalmic migraine) is not recognized in major headache classifications and does not encompass brainstem symptoms.","conceptual_foundation":"Basilar migraine falls under the broad category of primary headache disorders within the ICHD-3 taxonomy (ICD-11 code 8A80). It is classified under migraine with aura (8.2) subheading 8.2.3. Historically described by Bickerstaff and others in the mid-20th century, it was once termed basilar artery migraine due to speculation of posterior circulation involvement. Differential diagnoses include vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attack, vestibular migraine, and central causes of vertigo. Embryologically, vestibular nuclei derive from the rhombencephalon, and brainstem aura reflects transient dysfunction of brainstem neuronal networks. Neuroanatomically, the vestibular nuclei (located in the pons and medulla), locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei may be involved, with altered serotonin and glutamate neurotransmission and posterior circulation hypoperfusion identified during aura.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of the brainstem vestibular system integrates afferent signals from the inner ear and cerebellum. In migraine with brainstem aura, cortical and subcortical spreading depression extends into the brainstem, leading to transient ionic shifts, glutamate release, and regional hypoperfusion (Ducros & Bousser, 2009). Serotonergic dysfunction in dorsal raphe nuclei and calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide (CGRP) release contribute to vasodilation and neurogenic inflammation. Positron emission tomography studies demonstrate decreased blood flow in the posterior circulation during aura. The result is transient vertigo, dysarthria, and ataxia. In contrast, hemicrania continua involves sustained trigeminovascular activation without spreading depression, and medication overuse headache reflects receptor downregulation and central sensitization due to chronic analgesic exposure.","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine with brainstem aura typically presents in adolescents or young adults with recurrent attacks of headache preceded by aura symptoms such as vertigo (in up to 40%), tinnitus, dysarthria, diplopia, ataxia, and decreased level of consciousness (Evans et al., 2017). Headache is often bilateral or occipital, throbbing, moderate to severe, accompanied by photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea. Aura symptoms develop gradually over 5\u201360 minutes and resolve within 60 minutes. Prodromal features include mood changes and neck stiffness. In untreated cases, attacks may last 4\u201372 hours. Differential includes vertebrobasilar TIA (sudden onset, vascular risk factors) and vestibular migraine (no other brainstem signs).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on ICHD-3 criteria for migraine with brainstem aura: at least two attacks with fully reversible brainstem symptoms, no motor weakness, and headache fulfilling migraine criteria (Headache Classification Committee, 2018). First-tier investigations include a detailed history and neurologic exam to exclude red flags. Second-tier studies\u2014brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging\u2014rule out posterior fossa lesions or ischemia. Vestibular testing may support diagnosis but is not required. Pre-test probability is high in younger patients with stereotyped episodes and no vascular risk factors. No specific laboratory biomarkers are established.","management_principles":"Acute management avoids triptans and ergotamines due to concerns about basilar artery constriction (AAN guidelines, 2015). NSAIDs and antiemetics are first-line (e.g., naproxen 500 mg, metoclopramide 10 mg). Preventive therapy includes calcium channel blockers (verapamil 80\u2013240 mg daily) or flunarizine (10 mg nightly), which reduce attack frequency by >50% in 40\u201360% of patients (Goadsby et al., 2016). CGRP monoclonal antibodies may be considered in refractory cases. Lifestyle modifications (sleep hygiene, hydration, trigger avoidance) further reduce attack burden.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur every 3\u20136 months to monitor headache diaries, assess treatment response, and screen for medication overuse. MRI surveillance is not routinely required unless new red flags emerge. Preventive therapy may be tapered after 6\u201312 months of remission. Patient education on recognizing aura onset and early abortive treatment is critical to reduce progression to headache. Quality-of-life assessments (e.g., HIT-6) guide therapy adjustments.","clinical_pearls":"1. Basilar migraine (migraine with brainstem aura) often presents with vertigo and ataxia without motor weakness\u2014avoid triptans in aura phase. 2. Differentiation from TIA relies on gradual aura onset over minutes versus sudden deficits. 3. Indomethacin responsiveness distinguishes hemicrania continua (but headache is continuous). 4.

Ophthalmoplegic (ophthalmic) migraine is characterized by recurrent headache attacks associated with paresis of one or more extraocular cranial nerves, most commonly the oculomotor (third) or abducens (sixth) nerve. Basilar migraine (option A) presents with brainstem aura symptoms such as vertigo, dysarthria, and ataxia, but not isolated cranial nerve palsies. Hemicrania continua (option B) is a continuous unilateral headache responsive to indomethacin, without episodic ophthalmoplegia. Medication overuse headache (option C) arises from overuse of analgesics or triptans and does not cause cranial nerve palsies. Ophthalmoplegic migraine remains the only headache disorder in ICHD-3 characterized by transient, recurrent ophthalmoplegia in association with migraine-type headache, justifying answer D.","conceptual_foundation":"Ophthalmoplegic migraine is classified under ICHD-3 Section 1.7.3 Recurrent Painful Ophthalmoplegic Neuropathy (formerly ophthalmoplegic migraine). It falls in the headache disorders chapter of ICD-11 (8A80). Differential diagnoses include Tolosa\u2013Hunt syndrome, intracranial aneurysm, demyelinating neuropathies (e.g., Miller Fisher syndrome), and cavernous sinus lesions. Historically described by Charcot and Wernicke in the 19th century, its classification has evolved from a migraine variant to a cranial neuropathy with associated headache. Embryologically, cranial nerves III and VI originate from the basal plate of the midbrain and pons respectively; their blood supply derives from the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries for III, and the basilar artery branches for VI. The condition demonstrates a neuropathic process potentially involving neurovascular inflammation around these nerves.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of cranial nerve function involves intact myelinated axonal conduction via microvascular perfusion. In ophthalmoplegic migraine, proposed mechanisms include reversible demyelination and vasogenic edema of the affected nerve, and recurrent perineural inflammation triggered by migraine cascade mediators (e.g., calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide, nitric oxide). Neurogenic inflammation leads to breakdown of the blood\u2013nerve barrier, transient conduction block, and cranial nerve palsy. Imaging frequently shows gadolinium enhancement of the cisternal segment of the affected nerve, reflecting inflammatory changes. This distinguishes it from basilar migraine, where no focal nerve enhancement occurs, and from demyelinating neuropathies, which show different MRI patterns.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with moderate-to-severe unilateral headache preceded or accompanied by diplopia, ptosis, and limited ocular motility corresponding to the third or sixth nerve territory. Headache typically lasts 4\u201372 hours; nerve palsy may persist days to weeks. Recurrence is common, with mean attack frequency of 1\u20133 per year. There are no systemic features. In untreated cases, recovery is usually complete within 2\u20136 weeks. ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria require at least two attacks, demonstration of paresis on exam, and exclusion of other causes by imaging.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes MRI brain with high-resolution cranial nerve protocol and contrast, which shows nerve enhancement in \u226580% of cases (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). MRA and CTA exclude aneurysm. CSF analysis and serologies are low-yield unless systemic signs are present. Second-tier testing (e.g., nerve conduction studies, EMG) is reserved for persistent palsy beyond 6 weeks. Pretest probability is high in recurrent, stereotyped attacks in young patients without vascular risk factors. No established biomarker exists.","management_principles":"Acute management follows migraine protocols: high-dose NSAIDs or triptans at headache onset. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 1 mg/kg taper over 2\u20134 weeks) are often used to hasten cranial nerve recovery based on case series (n=32, median recovery 10 days vs. 30 days without steroids). Prophylaxis with verapamil or topiramate may reduce attack frequency. Oculoplastic intervention is rarely needed for persistent diplopia. Indomethacin is ineffective and not indicated, distinguishing it from hemicrania continua.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes ophthalmologic evaluation at 2\u20134 weeks to document resolution of palsy. Repeat MRI at 3\u20136 months ensures resolution of nerve enhancement. Monitor for recurrence every 6\u201312 months. No long-term sequelae are expected in the majority (>90%) following appropriate treatment. Patient education focuses on early treatment of headache to prevent prolonged neuropathy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Ophthalmoplegic migraine is now classified as a cranial neuropathy (ICHD-3 1.7.3) rather than a primary migraine variant. 2. MRI with contrast often shows enhancement of the affected nerve, helping distinguish it from other causes. 3. High-dose corticosteroids shorten duration of nerve palsy\u2014use early in the attack. 4. Absence of autonomic features and response to indomethacin exclude hemicrania continua. 5. Recurrent, self-limited palsies in young patients with stereotyped headaches strongly suggest ophthalmoplegic migraine.","references":"1.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is classified as FDA pregnancy category B and is considered the first-line analgesic for migraine in the first and second trimesters due to its well-established safety profile and minimal risk of teratogenicity. Numerous cohort studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated no increase in major congenital malformations with acetaminophen exposure in early pregnancy (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95\u20131.10). Option B (NSAIDs) is incorrect because nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are discouraged in the third trimester due to closure of the ductus arteriosus and oligohydramnios risk, although limited use in the first and second trimesters is sometimes accepted. Option C (Hydrocodone) is incorrect because opioids carry risks of neonatal withdrawal syndrome, maternal dependency, and are not recommended as first-line therapy. Option D (Sumatriptan) is category C; while registry data suggest relative safety, it is reserved for rescue therapy only after simple analgesics fail and is not considered the safest initial choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine in pregnancy requires understanding of pain pathways and placental pharmacology. Acetaminophen crosses the placenta in limited amounts, but its hydroxylated metabolites remain low. NSAIDs impair fetal prostaglandin synthesis, especially in later trimesters, and opioids act on \u03bc receptors with potential neonatal respiratory depression and withdrawal. Triptans (serotonin 5-HT1B/1D agonists) have not shown clear teratogenicity, but lack of large randomized trials mandates reserved use. The diagnosis of migraine in pregnancy follows ICHD-3 criteria, with emphasis on ruling out secondary causes. Management balances maternal benefit and fetal safety.","pathophysiology":"Normal prostaglandin and serotonin signaling maintain uteroplacental blood flow. Acetaminophen acts centrally by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS without significant systemic anti-inflammatory effects. NSAIDs block COX-1 and COX-2, reducing prostaglandins and risking premature ductus arteriosus closure. Opioids bind to \u03bc receptors and cross the placenta readily, exposing the fetus to respiratory depressants. Sumatriptan\u2019s vasoconstrictive action on serotonic receptors could theoretically affect placental blood flow, though registry data do not show adverse outcomes.","clinical_manifestation":"Pregnant migraineurs typically experience unchanged or improved headaches in pregnancy; about 50% improve, 25% worsen. Attacks present as unilateral, throbbing pain with nausea, photophobia, phonophobia. Acetaminophen effectively aborts mild to moderate attacks in >70% of patients. NSAIDs are effective but limited by trimester. Sumatriptan aborts attacks in 60% of nonpregnant patients but is second-line in pregnancy.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes history to confirm ICHD-3 migraine criteria and exclude secondary causes (e.g., preeclampsia, intracranial hemorrhage). Physical and neurologic exam must be normal. No routine imaging unless red flags. Pregnancy labs include CBC, liver and renal panels to guide medication dosing. Acetaminophen dosing (650\u20131000 mg q6h) is safe, with max 3 g/day.","management_principles":"First-line: acetaminophen 650\u20131000 mg orally every 6 hours as needed (max 3 g/day). Second-line (rescue): sumatriptan 50\u2013100 mg single dose if simple analgesics fail. Avoid NSAIDs in trimester 3. Avoid opioids except in refractory cases under specialist supervision. Nonpharmacologic: hydration, rest, cold packs, relaxation techniques.","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess response after 2\u20133 attacks. If acetaminophen fails twice, consider obstetric-neurology consultation. Monitor for overuse headaches. Review liver function monthly if high-dose acetaminophen is used. Educate patient on maximum dosing and red-flag symptoms (e.g. visual changes, hypertension).","clinical_pearls":"1. Acetaminophen is the safest abortive analgesic in pregnancy\u2019s first two trimesters. 2. NSAIDs risk ductal constriction\u2014avoid in trimester 3. 3. Sumatriptan is category C but acceptable if first-line fails. 4. Opioids carry neonatal withdrawal risks\u2014reserve only for severe refractory pain. 5. Nonpharmacologic measures complement pharmacotherapy and reduce medication needs.","references":"1. Marshall SV, et al. Paracetamol in pregnancy: systematic review.
