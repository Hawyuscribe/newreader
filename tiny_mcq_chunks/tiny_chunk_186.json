[{"question_number":"2","question":"A spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows an intermediary non-enhancing mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Astrocytoma","Ependymoma"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Astrocytoma","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Astrocytoma. Intramedullary spinal cord tumors are broadly classified into ependymomas and astrocytomas. Ependymomas typically demonstrate robust contrast enhancement, central localization, and associated cysts or hemosiderin caps on MRI. In contrast, spinal astrocytomas are infiltrative lesions that often do not enhance or show only minimal, patchy enhancement post-contrast due to preservation of the blood\u2013brain barrier in low-grade tumors. In this case, the spine MRI reveals an intramedullary mass without contrast enhancement, making astrocytoma far more likely. Option B is incorrect because spinal ependymomas almost invariably enhance uniformly; a non-enhancing intramedullary lesion effectively excludes ependymoma in favor of astrocytoma or other non-enhancing gliomas.","conceptual_foundation":"Spinal cord tumors are classified anatomically as intramedullary (within cord parenchyma), intradural extramedullary, and extradural. Intramedullary tumors in adults are most commonly ependymomas (50\u201360%) followed by astrocytomas (30\u201340%). Astrocytomas derive from astrocytic cells, appearing as diffuse, infiltrative masses that expand the cord without a clear capsule. Ependymomas originate from ependymal cells lining the central canal, often forming well-demarcated, centrally located lesions. The ICD-11 classification places astrocytoma under \u201cPrimary malignant neoplasm of spinal cord\u201d (1C03.Z). Differential diagnoses for non-enhancing intramedullary lesions also include low-grade gliomas and demyelinating lesions. Historically, improved MRI resolution has refined differentiation: low-grade astrocytomas maintain an intact blood\u2013brain barrier, explaining the minimal enhancement.","pathophysiology":"Normal spinal cord physiology depends on intact glial support. Astrocytomas arise when astrocytes undergo neoplastic transformation, often driven by mutations in TP53, IDH1/2 (in low-grade forms), and aberrant MAPK pathway activation. This neoplastic proliferation infiltrates adjacent white and gray matter, displacing but often preserving microvascular integrity. The intact blood\u2013brain barrier prevents contrast leakage, resulting in non-enhancing MRI appearance. Ependymomas, by contrast, disrupt the perivascular ependymal lining and basement membrane, permitting gadolinium passage and uniform enhancement. On a molecular level, ependymomas frequently harbor RELA fusion proteins or NF2 mutations, correlating with their distinct imaging phenotypes. Over time, astrocytomas can undergo malignant transformation to higher grades with eventual blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown and enhancement.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with spinal cord astrocytomas present with gradually progressive myelopathy. Initial symptoms include localized back pain (60\u201380%), which precedes neurologic deficits by months. Motor weakness evolves insidiously (average 6\u201312 months), followed by sensory disturbances (dissociated sensory loss below lesion) and sphincter dysfunction (urinary retention in ~50%, fecal incontinence less common). Astrocytomas often present in the second to fourth decades. In contrast, ependymomas more frequently present in adults aged 30\u201350 and may demonstrate a subacute onset with sudden deterioration if intratumoral hemorrhage occurs. Recognizing the chronic, slowly progressive nature of astrocytoma aids differentiation from other intramedullary processes.","diagnostic_approach":"Magnetic resonance imaging with T1, T2, and post-contrast sequences is the diagnostic gold standard for suspected intramedullary tumors. Low-grade astrocytomas appear T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense, and typically non-enhancing. Ependymomas are T1 isointense to hypointense, T2 hyperintense, and show strong, homogeneous enhancement. Advanced techniques\u2014diffusion tensor imaging for fiber tract mapping and MR spectroscopy to assess choline-to-N-acetylaspartate ratios\u2014improve tumor characterization. Preoperative workup includes full neurological examination, MRI of the entire neuraxis to exclude drop metastases, and multidisciplinary surgical planning. Biopsy is reserved for atypical imaging or when histology will alter management.","management_principles":"Maximal safe surgical resection is the cornerstone of treatment for spinal astrocytomas. Due to infiltrative margins, gross total resection is often not feasible without neurologic compromise; subtotal resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (45\u201350 Gy over 25\u201328 fractions) balances tumor control with functional preservation. Chemotherapy has limited proven benefit in low-grade astrocytomas but may be considered in high-grade or recurrent cases (temozolomide regimens extrapolated from intracranial protocols). In contrast, ependymomas, being well-circumscribed, often allow gross total resection with >80% 5-year progression-free survival; adjuvant radiotherapy is reserved for residual disease or high-grade histology.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI within 48 hours assesses the extent of resection. Surveillance MRI is recommended every 3\u20136 months for the first two years, then annually up to five years, and biennially thereafter. Neurological examinations should be performed concurrently with imaging. Long-term follow-up addresses potential late radiation effects, secondary neoplasms, and neurologic functional status. Rehabilitation with physical and occupational therapy mitigates motor deficits and optimizes quality of life.","clinical_pearls":"1. Non-enhancing intramedullary lesions on spinal MRI favor astrocytoma over ependymoma.\n2. Ependymomas often present with a hemosiderin cap or polar cysts aiding MRI differentiation.\n3. Low-grade astrocytomas maintain blood\u2013brain barrier integrity, explaining their non-enhancing nature.\n4. Surgical goals differ: gross total resection for ependymomas, maximal safe resection for astrocytomas to preserve function.\n5. Adjuvant radiotherapy is standard for residual spinal astrocytoma but reserved for high-grade or recurrent ependymoma.","references":"[1] Borovich B, et al.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by hamartomatous growths (tubers) in the cerebral cortex, which enhance on contrast MRI and are strongly associated with seizures. Option A, tram-track calcification, is a radiographic hallmark of Sturge-Weber syndrome, not TSC. Option C, bilateral optic gliomas, is pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis type 1 rather than TSC.","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, leading to dysregulation of the mTOR pathway. It is classified under ICD-11 code 8A03. Characteristic features include cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, renal angiomyolipomas, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and facial angiofibromas. Differential diagnoses include Sturge-Weber syndrome (leptomeningeal angiomatosis), neurofibromatosis, and von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease.","pathophysiology":"Normal regulation of cell growth involves hamartin and tuberin forming a complex that inhibits mTORC1. In TSC, loss of TSC1/2 function leads to constitutive mTOR activation, driving uncontrolled cell growth and hamartoma formation. Cortical tubers arise from abnormal neuronal and glial proliferation during fetal brain development, leading to dysplastic tissue prone to epileptogenesis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in infancy or early childhood with seizures (up to 90%), developmental delay, behavioral issues, and dermatologic findings such as hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, and Shagreen patches.

Multiple large series (e.g., Ohgaki and Kleihues, 2005; Ostrom et al., 2019) have confirmed that radiographic necrosis and infiltrative bilateral spread across midline structures are pathognomonic of high\u2010grade gliomas. Grade II diffuse astrocytomas by definition lack necrosis and do not cross midline in a \u2018\u2018butterfly\u2019\u2019 pattern. Thus, option A is correct and option B is incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Gliomas are primary central nervous system tumors arising from glial cells. The WHO 2016/2021 classification integrates histologic features (mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, necrosis) and molecular markers (IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion) to grade astrocytic tumors from I to IV. Grade II astrocytomas show low cellularity and mitotic figures but lack necrosis or endothelial proliferation. Grade IV (glioblastoma) exhibits necrosis and microvascular proliferation. The \u2018\u2018butterfly\u2019\u2019 pattern refers to bilateral hemispheric involvement via corpus callosum infiltration\u2014a feature most specific for glioblastoma multiforme.","pathophysiology":"Normal astrocytes support neurons and maintain the blood\u2013brain barrier. In glioblastoma, genetic alterations (e.g., EGFR amplification, PTEN loss, TERT promoter mutation) drive aberrant proliferation, neoangiogenesis, and necrosis. Microvascular proliferation arises from VEGF overexpression. Rapid tumor expansion outstrips its blood supply, leading to central ischemic necrosis\u2014seen radiographically as ring\u2010enhancement with nonenhancing core. Necrosis and pseudopalisading cells are histologic hallmarks correlating with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis (median survival ~15 months with standard therapy).","clinical_manifestation":"Glioblastoma typically presents in adults (peak incidence 55\u201375 years) with headaches, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and cognitive changes. The \u2018\u2018butterfly\u2019\u2019 variant may present with bilateral hemiparesis or interhemispheric disconnection syndromes. Rapid progression over weeks to months is common. Grade II astrocytomas present more indolently over months to years, with seizures often the initial symptom and slower evolution of deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Contrast\u2010enhanced MRI is the gold standard. Grade IV lesions demonstrate ring enhancement with central necrosis and marked peritumoral edema. Advanced techniques (MR spectroscopy, perfusion imaging) increase specificity (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~85%). Tissue diagnosis via stereotactic biopsy or resection remains essential for definitive grading and molecular studies (IDH status, MGMT methylation).","management_principles":"The current standard for glioblastoma (Stupp protocol) combines maximal safe resection followed by concurrent radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions) with temozolomide, then adjuvant temozolomide for six cycles.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Chordoma","Histiocytosis ## Page 17"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Chordoma","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. Chordoma. Chordomas are rare, locally aggressive neoplasms arising from notochord remnants at the clivus and sacrococcygeal regions, representing approximately 1\u20134% of all primary bone tumors. Clival chordomas can extend inferiorly into the nasopharynx and may protrude into the nasal cavity, becoming visible on nasal endoscopic examination or even at the nostril. In contrast, Langerhans cell histiocytosis primarily affects pediatric craniofacial bones with lytic lesions, often presenting with pain, swelling, or systemic symptoms, and does not characteristically present as a mass visible at the nostril. No high-level evidence supports a histiocytosis lesion protruding visibly through the nasal aperture. Common misconceptions include confusing chordoma with nasopharyngeal carcinoma or chondrosarcoma; histiocytosis rarely manifests with a protruding nasal mass.","conceptual_foundation":"Chordomas are malignant bone tumors of notochordal origin classified under the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of bone tumors. Embryologically, the notochord forms the axial skeleton during early development, and remnants may persist in the clivus and sacrum. On ICD-11, clival chordoma is coded under C41.2 (malignant neoplasm of skull base). The differential diagnosis for a clival mass includes chondrosarcoma (paramedian location, calcified matrix), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (mucosal origin with submucosal spread), meningioma (dural-based, with dural tail), pituitary macroadenoma (sellar region), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (osteolytic, systemic involvement). Historically, chordomas were first described by Virchow in 1857 and Ribbert in 1894, with the term \u201cchordoma\u201d reflecting their notochordal lineage.","pathophysiology":"Chordomas derive from malignant transformation of notochordal remnants, characterized by brachyury (T-gene) overexpression, which drives tumor proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Physaliphorous cells containing vacuolated, mucin-rich cytoplasm are emblematic. The extracellular matrix is glycosaminoglycan-rich, contributing to the gelatinous consistency. Locally, chordomas invade bone and dura, often encasing cranial nerves\u2014most notably CN VI in Dorello\u2019s canal\u2014leading to diplopia. Hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promoting neoangiogenesis. By contrast, Langerhans cell histiocytosis involves clonal proliferation of CD1a+ Langerhans cells driven by BRAF V600E mutations in approximately 50\u201360% of cases, leading to focal osteolysis rather than large soft-tissue masses.","clinical_manifestation":"Clival chordoma typically presents in adults aged 40\u201360 years with headaches (60\u201380%), diplopia due to abducens nerve palsy (25\u201350%), and progressive nasal obstruction or epistaxis when the tumor extends inferiorly. Rarely, large exophytic tumors can be visible at the nostril. Other manifestations include cranial nerve deficits (III\u2013XII), dysphagia, and pituitary dysfunction if the sella is involved. Natural history without intervention includes gradual neurologic deterioration, increased intracranial pressure, and median survival of 6\u20137 years. Histological subtypes\u2014classic, chondroid, and dedifferentiated\u2014carry distinct prognoses, with dedifferentiated chordomas portending the worst outcome.","diagnostic_approach":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the investigation of choice, revealing a midline, lobulated mass with high T2 signal intensity and heterogeneous T1 post-contrast enhancement; CT complements by delineating bone destruction. Endoscopic endonasal biopsy confirms histopathology, showing physaliphorous cells positive for cytokeratins, S-100, and brachyury (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~100%). Differential imaging diagnoses include paramedian chondrosarcoma (calcified chondroid matrix), meningioma (dural tail), and metastatic disease. Preoperative angiography may be indicated for tumors with high vascularity. Positron emission tomography (PET/CT) is investigational but may identify distant metastases.","management_principles":"First-line management is maximal safe resection, ideally via an endoscopic endonasal approach, supported by Class I evidence for improved local control. Adjuvant proton beam radiotherapy is recommended for residual disease or recurrence (Class II), taking advantage of its dosimetric precision to spare adjacent critical structures. There is no standard systemic therapy; targeted agents against PDGFR and brachyury are under clinical investigation. Imatinib has demonstrated limited benefit in phase II trials. Multidisciplinary care including neurosurgery, radiation oncology, neuro-oncology, and rehabilitation is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Surveillance MRI every 6 months for the first 2 years, then annually for at least 10 years, is recommended due to the propensity for late recurrence. Clinical evaluations at each visit should assess cranial nerve function and pituitary axis if involved. Endoscopic nasal examination may detect early local recurrence. Long-term monitoring for radiation-induced sequelae (e.g., brainstem necrosis, endocrinopathies) is advised.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent subtype of AIDS-associated lymphoma, representing approximately 50\u201360% of cases (Gopal et al. 2014; Bower et al. 2018). In HIV-infected patients, DLBCL often occurs in extranodal sites including the central nervous system (primary CNS lymphoma), gastrointestinal tract, liver, and bone marrow. The sensitivity of CD20 immunostaining for DLBCL in HIV-related cases approaches 98% (Mankoff et al. 2016). Option B, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, is the second most common subtype, accounting for roughly 25\u201330% of HIV-associated lymphomas (Bower et al. 2018), but is less frequent than DLBCL. Option A, EBV-related lymphoma, describes an etiologic association rather than a histologic subtype; while Epstein\u2013Barr virus is implicated in many HIV-associated lymphomas (up to 80% of primary CNS lymphomas), EBV positivity cuts across several histologic categories and is not itself a subtype. Common exam misconception: conflating EBV positivity with a distinct lymphoma category rather than a viral association across subtypes.","conceptual_foundation":"AIDS-associated lymphomas are high-grade B-cell neoplasms that arise in the setting of chronic HIV-induced immunosuppression. The 2016 WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms places DLBCL and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma in the aggressive B-cell lymphoma category. In HIV patients, chronic antigenic stimulation, loss of cytotoxic T-cell surveillance, and EBV infection contribute to lymphomagenesis. DLBCL typically presents as sheets of large atypical lymphoid cells with vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and high Ki-67 proliferation index (>80%). Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma shows a \u2018starry sky\u2019 pattern with nearly 100% Ki-67 positivity and c-MYC translocation (t(8;14)). Taxonomically, DLBCL in HIV can be subclassified into immunoblastic and centroblastic variants; the immunoblastic variant often demonstrates stronger EBV positivity. PCNSL in AIDS is almost always an EBV-positive DLBCL.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, B-cells undergo germinal center reactions with tightly regulated proliferation and apoptosis. In HIV, depletion of CD4+ T-cells disrupts germinal center homeostasis. Chronic antigenic stimulation and cytokine dysregulation (elevated IL-6, IL-10) promote B-cell hyperplasia. Loss of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell surveillance permits latent EBV reactivation in infected B-cells; EBV latent membrane proteins (LMP-1, LMP-2) activate NF-\u03baB and JAK/STAT pathways, driving proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Genetic hits such as c-MYC translocations in BL or BCL6 rearrangements in DLBCL further transform B-cells. Accumulation of these molecular lesions, coupled with an impaired immune microenvironment, culminates in aggressive lymphoma.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy, \u2018B\u2019 symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), and extranodal masses. In primary CNS DLBCL, clinical features include focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and cognitive decline. Systemic DLBCL often involves the gastrointestinal tract, liver, bone marrow, and skin. Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma in HIV may present with jaw or facial bone involvement in endemic areas or abdominal masses in sporadic forms. Median age at presentation is 35\u201345 years, often with CD4 counts <100 cells/\u00b5L. The natural history is aggressive, with median untreated survival <3 months for CNS involvement and <6 months for systemic disease.","diagnostic_approach":"Definitive diagnosis requires excisional lymph node or tissue biopsy with histology, immunohistochemistry (CD20+, CD10+/\u2013, BCL2 variable), flow cytometry, and cytogenetics. EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization confirms EBV positivity. Staging includes PET-CT or CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, bone marrow biopsy, CSF examination for suspected CNS involvement, and MRI brain for neurologic symptoms. HIV viral load and CD4 count are assessed concurrently. Sensitivity of PET-CT for staging DLBCL is >95%, specificity ~85% (Barrington et al. 2014).","management_principles":"Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is foundational and improves chemotherapy tolerance and outcomes. Standard treatment for DLBCL in HIV is R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone); studies show 2-year overall survival ~60\u201370% in cART-treated patients (Citte et al. 2017). In BL, dose-adjusted R-EPOCH regimens yield complete remission rates >70%. For primary CNS DLBCL, high-dose methotrexate\u2013based regimens plus rituximab are used, often with cytarabine. Rituximab reduces relapse (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4\u20130.8) but increases infection risk in severely immunosuppressed.","follow_up_guidelines":"After treatment, surveillance includes physical exam, CD4 count, HIV viral load every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months. Imaging (PET-CT or MRI) at 6- to 12-month intervals for the first 2 years. Monitor for late toxicities: cardiotoxicity from anthracyclines, neuropathy from vincristine, opportunistic infections. Relapse risk stratification uses the HIV-IPI incorporating age, performance status, LDH, extranodal sites, and CD4 count.","clinical_pearls":"1. DLBCL is the most common AIDS-associated lymphoma; always include in differential for new mass. 2. EBV positivity is nearly universal in primary CNS lymphoma in HIV, guiding diagnostic EBER staining. 3. cART initiation improves lymphoma treatment outcomes and should not be withheld. 4. Rituximab decreases relapse but monitor opportunistic infection risk in CD4 <50 cells/\u00b5L. 5. Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma in HIV requires more intensive therapy (dose-adjusted R-EPOCH) than DLBCL.","references":"1. Gopal S, et al.
