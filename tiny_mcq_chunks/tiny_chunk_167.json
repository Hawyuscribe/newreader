NF1 is characterized by hyperpigmented caf\u00e9 au lait spots, axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas. NF2 lacks significant skin pigmentary findings and instead features bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other intracranial tumors. Multiple clinical series (Northrup & Krueger, 2013) report hypomelanotic macules in >90% of TSC patients by early childhood, whereas caf\u00e9 au lait macules are the hallmark of NF1 (Ferner & Gutmann, 2019).","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder due to pathogenic variants in TSC1 (hamartin) or TSC2 (tuberin), leading to dysregulation of mTOR signaling and hamartoma formation in multiple organs. In ICD-11 it is coded under 8A60.1. Hypomelanotic macules (\u201cash leaf spots\u201d) represent areas of reduced melanin deposition.

Loss of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to constitutive mTORC1 activation, disrupting melanogenesis and causing focal hypopigmentation. On a cellular level, mTORC1 overactivation drives abnormal cell growth and hamartoma formation in skin, brain, heart, and kidneys, explaining both ash leaf spots and cortical tubers.","clinical_manifestation":"Hypomelanotic macules appear in infancy or early childhood; present in >90% by age 1.

Chiari I malformation, marked by herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, can compress the dorsolateral medulla and upper cervical spinal cord, interrupting descending sympathetic fibers and causing ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Leigh disease","Mealas syndrome","MNGIE","Other"],"subspecialty":"Pediatric Neurology","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2022","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Leigh disease","explanation":{"option_analysis":"### A) Leigh disease\nThe correct answer is Leigh disease (also known as subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy). This condition is characterized by bilateral symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia, particularly affecting the putamen and globus pallidus, which can be visualized on MRI. In a young child, especially one with developmental delay, these findings are highly suggestive of Leigh disease. The clinical presentation typically includes developmental regression, hypotonia, and signs of neurological impairment, aligning well with the case of the 5-year-old male in the question.\n\n### B) MELAS syndrome\nMitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a mitochondrial disorder that can present with neurological symptoms, including stroke-like episodes and seizures. However, it typically shows cortical and subcortical lesions on imaging rather than the characteristic basal ganglia lesions seen in Leigh disease. While lactic acidosis can be present in both conditions, MELAS usually presents with more diverse symptoms, including hearing loss and diabetes, which are not mentioned in this case.\n\n### C) MNGIE\nMitochondrial Neurogastrointestinal Encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) primarily affects the gastrointestinal system and can lead to neuropathy but is less commonly associated with the specific neuroimaging findings of bilateral putamen and globus pallidus lesions. MNGIE typically presents with gastrointestinal dysmotility, weight loss, and peripheral neuropathy, making it less likely in this scenario of a child with developmental delay and specific MRI findings.\n\n### D) Other\nThe \"Other\" category could encompass a variety of conditions, but none are as specifically indicated by the MRI findings as Leigh disease. Conditions such as Wilson's disease or other metabolic disorders may show some basal ganglia involvement, but they typically have additional clinical features or different imaging characteristics that would differentiate them from Leigh disease.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nLeigh disease is a type of mitochondrial disorder that primarily affects energy metabolism, particularly in the nervous system. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, responsible for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. Leigh disease results from defects in mitochondrial function often related to mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins.\n\nThe disease is classified as a subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, signifying that the condition leads to progressive degeneration of the brain's gray matter, particularly affecting areas rich in mitochondria such as the basal ganglia, brainstem, and spinal cord. The hallmark of Leigh disease is the presence of necrotic lesions in these areas, which can lead to significant neurological impairment.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiology of Leigh disease involves a failure in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, leading to insufficient ATP production. This energy deficit primarily affects tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and heart. As a result, there is a buildup of lactic acid (lactic acidosis) due to anaerobic metabolism.\n\nThe genetic mutations responsible for Leigh disease can affect various components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to a cascade of metabolic derangements. The most common mutations are in the genes associated with complex I of the electron transport chain, but mutations can also occur in other complexes or in mitochondrial translation and replication machinery.\n\nThe characteristic bilateral symmetrical lesions observed in Leigh disease are due to neurodegeneration and necrosis in the putamen and globus pallidus. These areas are critically involved in motor control, which explains the motor deficits observed in affected individuals.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nLeigh disease typically presents in infancy or early childhood, with symptoms often emerging between 3 months to 2 years of age. The clinical manifestations can vary widely but commonly include:\n\n- Developmental Delay: Children may exhibit a failure to meet developmental milestones, such as sitting or walking.\n  \n- Psychomotor Regression: Loss of previously acquired skills is common, alongside hypotonia (decreased muscle tone).\n\n- Neurological Symptoms: These may include seizures, ataxia (lack of voluntary coordination), and dystonia (sustained muscle contractions).\n\n- Lactic Acidosis: Elevated lactate levels can be detected in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), often leading to metabolic acidosis.\n\n- Respiratory Distress: Some children may present with signs of respiratory failure due to brainstem involvement.\n\n- Other Features: Additional findings may include abnormal eye movements, optic atrophy, and cardiac involvement (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).\n\nThe combination of developmental delay, neurological symptoms, and specific MRI findings strongly suggests Leigh disease in the presented case.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nDiagnosing Leigh disease involves a multi-faceted approach:\n\n- Clinical Evaluation: A thorough history and physical examination focusing on developmental milestones and neurological signs.\n\n- Imaging Studies: MRI is crucial for revealing characteristic bilateral symmetrical lesions in the putamen and globus pallidus. T2-weighted images typically show hyperintense areas indicative of necrosis.\n\n- Metabolic Testing: Blood and CSF analysis should be conducted to evaluate for lactic acidosis. Elevated lactate levels can support the diagnosis.\n\n- Genetic Testing: If Leigh disease is suspected, molecular genetic testing may be performed to identify pathogenic mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA.\n\n- Differential Diagnosis: Clinicians must distinguish Leigh disease from other metabolic disorders (such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy), neurodegenerative diseases, and toxic or infectious causes of encephalopathy.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nManagement of Leigh disease is largely supportive, as there is currently no cure. Treatment strategies may include:\n\n- Symptomatic Management: Addressing seizures with antiepileptic medications, managing hypotonia with physical therapy, and treating any metabolic abnormalities.\n\n- Nutritional Support: Ensuring adequate caloric intake is essential, particularly in cases with gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n- Psychosocial Support: Engaging with multidisciplinary teams, including neurologists, dietitians, and therapists, can improve quality of life.\n\n- Clinical Trials: Some investigational therapies are exploring the use of antioxidants, coenzyme Q10, and other mitochondrial-targeted therapies, though these are still under study.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nLong-term follow-up in patients with Leigh disease is critical due to the progressive nature of the disorder. Monitoring should include:\n\n- Regular Neurological Assessments: To track developmental progress and adjust management strategies as needed.\n\n- Lactate Monitoring: Periodic evaluations of lactate levels can help in managing metabolic crises.\n\n- Cardiac Evaluation: Echocardiograms may be warranted to assess for cardiomyopathy, which can occur in these patients.\n\n- Psychosocial Support: Ongoing support for families to cope with the challenges associated with this condition.\n\nPrognosis varies widely; some children may have a relatively stable course for years, while others may experience rapid deterioration. Complications can include respiratory failure, feeding difficulties, and increased risk of infections.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Remember the MRI Findings: Bilateral symmetric putamen and globus pallidus lesions are classic for Leigh disease in pediatric patients.\n\n- Lactic Acidosis as a Key Indicator: Elevated lactate levels in blood and CSF can provide critical clues toward diagnosis.\n\n- Early Intervention is Key: Early diagnosis and supportive care can significantly improve outcomes and quality of life for affected children.\n\n- Genetic Counseling: Given the hereditary nature of mitochondrial disorders, genetic counseling is essential for families considering future pregnancies.\n\n## 9.

References","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosing Leigh disease involves a multi-faceted approach:\n\n- Clinical Evaluation: A thorough history and physical examination focusing on developmental milestones and neurological signs.\n\n- Imaging Studies: MRI is crucial for revealing characteristic bilateral symmetrical lesions in the putamen and globus pallidus. T2-weighted images typically show hyperintense areas indicative of necrosis.\n\n- Metabolic Testing: Blood and CSF analysis should be conducted to evaluate for lactic acidosis. Elevated lactate levels can support the diagnosis.\n\n- Genetic Testing: If Leigh disease is suspected, molecular genetic testing may be performed to identify pathogenic mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA.\n\n- Differential Diagnosis: Clinicians must distinguish Leigh disease from other metabolic disorders (such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy), neurodegenerative diseases, and toxic or infectious causes of encephalopathy.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nManagement of Leigh disease is largely supportive, as there is currently no cure. Treatment strategies may include:\n\n- Symptomatic Management: Addressing seizures with antiepileptic medications, managing hypotonia with physical therapy, and treating any metabolic abnormalities.\n\n- Nutritional Support: Ensuring adequate caloric intake is essential, particularly in cases with gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n- Psychosocial Support: Engaging with multidisciplinary teams, including neurologists, dietitians, and therapists, can improve quality of life.\n\n- Clinical Trials: Some investigational therapies are exploring the use of antioxidants, coenzyme Q10, and other mitochondrial-targeted therapies, though these are still under study.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nLong-term follow-up in patients with Leigh disease is critical due to the progressive nature of the disorder. Monitoring should include:\n\n- Regular Neurological Assessments: To track developmental progress and adjust management strategies as needed.\n\n- Lactate Monitoring: Periodic evaluations of lactate levels can help in managing metabolic crises.\n\n- Cardiac Evaluation: Echocardiograms may be warranted to assess for cardiomyopathy, which can occur in these patients.\n\n- Psychosocial Support: Ongoing support for families to cope with the challenges associated with this condition.\n\nPrognosis varies widely; some children may have a relatively stable course for years, while others may experience rapid deterioration. Complications can include respiratory failure, feeding difficulties, and increased risk of infections.\n\n## 8.

Leigh disease typically presents in infancy or early childhood with psychomotor regression, hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem. MELAS syndrome presents with stroke-like cortical lesions, lactic acidosis, and episodes of encephalopathy rather than isolated basal ganglia involvement. MNGIE (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy) features prominent gastrointestinal dysmotility, peripheral neuropathy, and diffuse leukoencephalopathy, not focal basal ganglia lesions. Therefore, the combination of developmental delay and symmetric globus pallidus and putamen changes most strongly supports Leigh disease.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:43:29.957902","word_count":4337,"source_file":"Part II 2022_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Pediatric Neurology","import_source":"pediatric_neurology_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"4","question":"In a normal child with a simple febrile seizure, what is the risk of developing epilepsy?","options":["3%","7%","10%","15%"],"subspecialty":"Pediatric Neurology","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2022","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"3%","explanation":{"option_analysis":"In otherwise healthy children with simple febrile seizures, the long\u2010term risk of developing epilepsy is approximately 2\u20134%.","pathophysiology":"Large cohort studies place the risk near 3%, which is only slightly above the baseline population risk of 1%.","clinical_manifestation":"Higher values such as 7\u201315% apply to complex febrile seizures or when additional risk factors (e.g., family history, developmental delay) are present.
