[{"question_number":"1","question":"Which of the following is a characteristic feature of Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)?","options":["Upper motor signs present","Conduction block confined to sensory axons","Progressive, distal, asymmetric motor weakness","More common in women"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Progressive, distal, asymmetric motor weakness","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option C is correct. Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) is characterized by a chronic, immune-mediated neuropathy producing progressive, asymmetric, distal motor weakness without sensory loss. Multiple studies, including Li et al. (2016), report that patients present with slowly progressive, asymmetric limb weakness, often beginning in the hands, with conduction block in motor nerves on electrophysiological testing. Conduction block confined to sensory axons (Option B) is incorrect because MMN primarily affects motor fibers. Upper motor neuron signs (Option A) are absent in MMN; their presence suggests amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or other central processes. MMN shows a male predominance (male:female ratio ~2:1), making Option D incorrect. Common misconceptions include confusing MMN with CIDP; unlike CIDP, MMN spares sensation and shows motor conduction block without demyelinating features on sensory studies.","conceptual_foundation":"MMN is classified under immune-mediated neuropathies in the ICD-11 under \u2018Mononeuropathies and Multifocal neuropathies\u2019. It differs from CIDP by its motor-only involvement and asymmetric distribution. Embryologically, peripheral nerves arise from neural crest cells; the selective autoimmune attack on motor axons in MMN involves antigens like GM1 ganglioside, explaining the motor specificity. The affected nerves follow distal-to-proximal fiber loss; hand and wrist extensors are often first involved. The immunopathogenesis implicates complement activation at the nodes of Ranvier and disruption of sodium channel clustering, leading to conduction block. Genetically, HLA associations (e.g., HLA-DRB1) have been reported but are less well defined than in Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, intact myelinated motor axons conduct action potentials via nodal sodium channels. In MMN, IgM autoantibodies against GM1 ganglioside bind to nodes of Ranvier, activating complement and causing focal demyelination and paranodal dysfunction. This leads to conduction block and temporal dispersion in motor fibers, while sensory fibers remain largely unaffected due to lower GM1 expression. The disease progresses chronically as antibody titers fluctuate; remyelination attempts lead to onion-bulb formation in severe cases. There is no significant axonal degeneration early, distinguishing MMN from motor neuron disease, although chronicity can lead to secondary axonal loss. Pathologically, endoneurial inflammatory infiltrates and complement deposition are seen on nerve biopsy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in middle adulthood (mean age ~40 years) with insidious, asymmetric weakness of distal limb muscles, most commonly wrist and finger extensors, leading to wrist drop. Sensory examination is normal. Reflexes are preserved or slightly reduced in affected limbs; no upper motor neuron signs. Variants include brachial-onset MMN and less commonly leg-onset forms. The natural history without treatment is gradual progression over years, with risk of fixed weakness due to secondary axonal loss. Diagnostic criteria (EFNS/PNS 2010) require: (1) clinical evidence of motor involvement in >2 nerves, (2) electrophysiological motor conduction block in at least one nerve, (3) exclusion of other causes.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Nerve conduction studies demonstrating conduction block in motor nerves (sensitivity ~80%), with normal sensory conduction. Anti-GM1 IgM antibody testing (positive in ~50%) supports diagnosis but is not mandatory. MRI may show nerve root enlargement. Second-tier: CSF analysis typically normal or mildly elevated protein (<50 mg/dL), differentiating from CIDP. Nerve ultrasound can detect focal enlargements. Third-tier: Nerve biopsy is rarely required, reserved for atypical cases. Pre-test probability is high in middle-aged men with distal asymmetric motor weakness and preserved sensation.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days, repeated every 4\u20136 weeks. Clinical trials show a 70% response rate and improvement in MRC sum score by 20% (Hughes et al. 2017). Corticosteroids and plasma exchange are generally ineffective or may worsen MMN. Second-line: Subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) can be used for maintenance. Third-line: Cyclophosphamide or rituximab have been tried in refractory cases with variable success. Physical therapy to maintain strength and prevent contractures is recommended.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be re-evaluated every 3\u20136 months with clinical strength testing and electrophysiology as needed. Dose and interval of IVIG should be adjusted based on functional status and side effects. Monitor for IVIG-related complications: thromboembolism, renal dysfunction. Long-term follow-up emphasizes prevention of secondary axonal loss by early initiation of therapy. Transition to SCIg may improve quality of life.","clinical_pearls":"1. MMN often mimics early ALS but spares sensation and has conduction block on NCS\u2014absence of UMN signs and normal sensory studies are key. 2. Anti-GM1 antibodies are supportive but absent in 50%\u2014do not exclude MMN if negative. 3. IVIG is the only effective treatment; steroids may worsen weakness. 4.

Neoplastic plexopathy. Neoplastic plexopathy results from direct invasion of the brachial plexus by metastatic tumor cells, most commonly from breast, lung, or prostate primary neoplasms. In breast cancer survivors, metastasis to the apex of the lung and adjacent brachial plexus frequently involves the lower trunk (C8\u2013T1) and the cervicothoracic (stellate) ganglion, producing severe, progressive shoulder pain radiating to the ulnar forearm and hand, accompanied by intrinsic hand muscle weakness, sensory loss in the C8\u2013T1 distribution, and Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis) [1,2]. MRI with contrast demonstrates nodular perineural enhancement with sensitivity of approximately 90% and specificity of 85% for tumor plexopathy [3].\n\nOption A (Carcinomatous meningitis) typically presents with multifocal cranial neuropathies, diffuse radiculopathies, meningeal signs, and positive CSF cytology, rather than a focal plexal lesion with Horner syndrome [6]. Option B (Cervical radiculopathy due to epidural metastasis) causes radicular pain and dermatomal motor/sensory deficits, often with reflex changes and spinal cord signs, but does not localize to a single brachial plexus trunk or involve the sympathetic chain [5]. Option D (Paraneoplastic plexopathy) or Parsonage\u2013Turner syndrome involves immune-mediated inflammation of the plexus, most often the upper trunk (C5\u2013C6), with acute pain but typically no sympathetic signs and motor deficits that resolve partially over months [4]. Option E (Radiation plexopathy) generally arises one to twenty years postradiation, presents with insidious mild pain or painless weakness, shows demyelinating features (myokymic discharges) on EMG, and lacks an enhancing mass on MRI or Horner syndrome [3]. Thus, the clinical presentation, imaging features, and temporal profile are most consistent with neoplastic plexopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"A thorough understanding of the brachial plexus anatomy, embryology, and nosology underpins the diagnosis of plexopathies. The plexus is formed by the ventral rami of C5\u2013T1 spinal nerves which coalesce into roots, trunks, divisions, cords, and terminal branches. The lower trunk (C8\u2013T1) traverses the interscalene triangle beneath the clavicle adjacent to the cervicothoracic (stellate) ganglion, accounting for concurrent sympathetic involvement and Horner syndrome when both structures are infiltrated. In ICD-11, metastatic infiltration of peripheral nerves is coded under ME09.5 (nerve infiltration by malignant neoplasm). Differential diagnoses include mononeuropathies (e.g., ulnar neuropathy at the elbow), cervical radiculopathies (root involvement), Parsonage\u2013Turner syndrome (acute brachial neuritis), radiation-induced plexopathy, and carcinomatous meningitis. Historically, Spalteholz\u2019s anatomical descriptions (early 20th century) gave way to Parsonage and Turner\u2019s clinical syndrome delineation in 1948, and modern high-resolution imaging has refined classification into neoplastic versus non-neoplastic plexopathies. Embryologically, neural crest cells form dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerve sheaths; perineural invasion by tumors exploits this architecture. Vascular supply arises from branches of the subclavian and axillary arteries, with watershed zones predisposing to ischemic injury in radiation plexopathy. On the molecular level, breast adenocarcinoma cells express metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) facilitating perineurial basement membrane degradation, and HER2 amplification correlates with increased neural tropism [12,2,11].","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, the brachial plexus transmits motor, sensory, and sympathetic fibers to the upper limb. Neoplastic plexopathy arises when malignant cells disseminate via lymphovascular routes to the lung apex and invade perineural spaces of C8\u2013T1 roots and trunks. Tumor-secreted metalloproteinases degrade the perineurial and epineurial barriers, allowing direct invasion of nerve fascicles. Mass effect from the tumor compresses endoneurial microvasculature, inducing ischemia and Wallerian degeneration distal to the lesion. Denervation leads to axonal loss and muscle atrophy, evidenced by fibrillation potentials on EMG. Simultaneous involvement of the stellate ganglion interrupts preganglionic sympathetic outflow, resulting in miosis (unopposed parasympathetic tone), ptosis (Mueller\u2019s muscle paresis), and anhidrosis (Horner syndrome). Local inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) exacerbate nerve injury, causing demyelination and further axonal loss. In radiation plexopathy, pathophysiology involves microvascular endothelial damage, vasa nervorum occlusion, and fibrosis without malignant cells. Paraneoplastic plexopathy is immune-mediated, with onconeural antibodies (e.g., anti-Hu) targeting neural antigens, leading to demyelination and axonal loss without mass effect. Epidural metastasis compresses dorsal roots and spinal cord leading to mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs [1,3,4,13].","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with neoplastic plexopathy present with a triad of acute to subacute severe shoulder and arm pain, progressive motor weakness, and sensory disturbances localized to a plexal distribution. Pain is typically lancinating or burning, radiating along the ulnar side of the forearm into the fourth and fifth digits, and is reported by up to 85% of affected individuals [1]. Motor involvement predominantly affects intrinsic hand muscles (interossei, lumbricals) and finger flexors (flexor digitorum profundus), resulting in grip weakness. Sensory loss occurs in the medial arm, forearm, and ulnar digits. Ipsilateral Horner syndrome\u2014ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis\u2014manifests in approximately 30% of cases due to stellate ganglion involvement. Reflexes may remain normal or slightly diminished, but EMG reveals denervation potentials and reduced recruitment in C8\u2013T1 myotomes. Upper trunk involvement (C5\u2013C6) is less common, presenting with deltoid and biceps weakness and lateral arm sensory deficits. Radiation plexopathy arises 1\u201320 years post-radiation, with mild or absent pain and slowly progressive weakness. Paraneoplastic plexopathy features acute onset pain, multifocal weakness, and demyelinating EMG patterns, typically without sympathetic signs. Carcinomatous meningitis causes diffuse radicular pain and multiple cranial neuropathies. Unchecked neoplastic plexopathy progresses relentlessly over weeks to months, often culminating in refractory pain and complete loss of function [6,1,3].","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with a detailed history and physical examination to assess cancer history, radiation exposure, pain characteristics, and neurologic deficits. First-tier imaging with contrast-enhanced MRI of the brachial plexus is a Class I recommendation, yielding a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 85% for neoplastic involvement [3]. T1-weighted sequences with fat suppression reveal focal nodular or fusiform perineural enhancement and plexal enlargement. When MRI is contraindicated, ^18F-FDG PET/CT serves as an alternative modality with sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 80% for identifying metabolically active metastases [2]. Electrophysiologic studies differentiate neoplastic plexopathy (axonal loss, fibrillations) from radiation-induced plexopathy (demyelination, myokymic discharges). In cases of inconclusive imaging, CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of the plexus yields histopathologic confirmation with a diagnostic accuracy of approximately 85% [7]. CSF analysis and cytology are indicated if carcinomatous meningitis is suspected, though >50% of initial taps may be false-negative [6]. Spinal MRI is essential to exclude epidural metastasis. Paraneoplastic antibody panels (anti-Hu, anti-Ri) are adjunctive for suspected paraneoplastic syndromes. This tiered approach balances diagnostic yield, invasiveness, and cost.","management_principles":"Management is multidisciplinary, integrating oncologic, neurologic, and palliative strategies. According to NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer (v4.2020), palliative radiotherapy to the involved plexus (30 Gy in 10 fractions) is a Class IIb, Level C recommendation, achieving clinically significant pain relief in approximately 70% of patients [8,10]. Systemic therapy tailored to tumor subtype (e.g., HER2-targeted agents in HER2-positive breast cancers) follows standard oncologic protocols. Pain control adheres to the WHO analgesic ladder: opioids (e.g., morphine, titrated to effect) and adjuvant neuropathic agents (gabapentin, NNT ~3 for neuropathic pain) form the backbone of analgesia [14]. Surgical intervention, such as plexus neurolysis or tumor debulking, is reserved for discrete, resectable masses and refractory pain despite optimal medical management [7]. Physical and occupational therapy aim to maintain joint range of motion, prevent contractures, and optimize functional adaptation. Bisphosphonates may reduce skeletal-related events in metastatic disease. For radiation-induced plexopathy, corticosteroids and rehabilitation remain mainstays given the non-neoplastic etiology. Paraneoplastic plexopathies may respond to immunotherapy (IVIG, plasmapheresis), but these are not effective for neoplastic plexopathy. Regular multidisciplinary review ensures concurrent optimization of oncologic control and supportive care [8,10,11].","follow_up_guidelines":"Ongoing surveillance encompasses clinical assessments, imaging, and functional monitoring. Neurologic examinations should occur every three months to document pain severity, motor strength (Medical Research Council grading), and sensory deficits. MRI of the brachial plexus with contrast is recommended every six months or sooner if deterioration arises, to evaluate treatment response or disease progression [3]. Pain management reviews coincide with neurologic follow-up, adjusting analgesic regimens as needed. The DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire, administered quarterly, quantifies functional impairment and guides rehabilitation goals. Laboratory monitoring (CBC, metabolic panel) follows systemic therapy protocols to detect cytopenias or metabolic derangements. Systemic imaging (e.g., chest CT) aligns with oncologic guidelines (every 6\u201312 months). Vigilance for radiation-induced plexopathy is warranted in those with prior radiotherapy, as symptoms may emerge up to two years post-treatment. Clear patient education on red flags\u2014rapid motor decline, new severe pain\u2014triggers expedited evaluation. Transition to palliative or hospice services is considered for refractory pain or widespread metastatic progression, emphasizing quality of life and symptom control [8,3].","clinical_pearls":"1.

Which of the following conditions could be the diagnosis?","options":["Nemaline myopathy","Miyoshi myopathy","Nonaka myopathy","Unknown"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Miyoshi myopathy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most correct answer is B. Miyoshi myopathy is characterized by early, selective involvement of the distal posterior calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) with very high serum creatine kinase (CK) levels often in the range of 3,000\u201320,000 IU/L. In their landmark 1986 description, Miyoshi et al. reported mean CK levels of 6,200 IU/L (range 2,500\u201312,000) in affected patients (1). Nemaline myopathy (Option A) is a congenital myopathy presenting in infancy or childhood with muscle weakness, hypotonia, and \u201crod bodies\u201d on biopsy; CK is typically normal or mildly elevated (<1,000 IU/L) (2). Nonaka myopathy (Option C), also known as distal rimmed\u2010vacuole myopathy or GNE myopathy, presents with early involvement of the anterior tibialis causing foot drop, moderate CK elevation (300\u20132,000 IU/L), and rimmed vacuoles on biopsy (3). Option D is incorrect because Miyoshi myopathy precisely matches the phenotype of early posterior calf weakness with markedly elevated CK. The diagnostic specificity of posterior calf\u2010predominant weakness plus CK >3,000 IU/L for dysferlinopathy is >95% (4).","conceptual_foundation":"Distal myopathies form a subgroup of muscular dystrophies in the ICD\u201011 (8C60.\u00a7) and the ENMC classification (5). They are genetically heterogeneous, affecting skeletal muscle integrity and function. Key entities include: Miyoshi myopathy (DYSF mutations), Nonaka myopathy (GNE mutations), Welander distal myopathy (TMD, TIA1 mutations), and others. Differential diagnosis also encompasses inflammatory myopathies, metabolic myopathies (e.g., Pompe disease), and neurogenic causes. Embryologically, skeletal muscle arises from the paraxial mesoderm via the Pax3/MyoD pathway; defects therein can predispose to congenital myopathies. Dysferlin is a calcium\u2010dependent membrane repair protein; its loss leads to sarcolemmal instability under mechanical stress, particularly in high-load calf muscles.","pathophysiology":"Under physiological conditions, dysferlin mediates Ca\u00b2\u207a-dependent patch repair of the sarcolemma after microinjury. DYSF mutations lead to defective membrane resealing, persistent Ca\u00b2\u207a influx, activation of calpains, and myofiber necrosis. Over time, repeated cycles of necrosis and regeneration cause fiber size variability, central nuclei, and inflammation on histology. CK leaks into the bloodstream through disrupted membranes, accounting for levels exceeding 5,000 IU/L. Nemaline myopathy arises from mutations in thin-filament proteins (e.g., NEB, ACTA1) leading to Z-line rod bodies; Nonaka myopathy involves GNE mutations that impair sialic acid synthesis and cause rimmed vacuole formation via autophagic dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"Miyoshi myopathy typically manifests in late adolescence (mean onset 17\u201320 years). Patients note difficulty standing on tiptoes, rapid fatigability of calf muscles, and calf atrophy. Proximal strength remains normal until late stages. Gower\u2019s sign may be absent. CK levels are markedly elevated (3,000\u201320,000 IU/L). Respiratory and cardiac involvement are rare. In contrast, nemaline myopathy presents in infancy with hypotonia, proximal > distal weakness, and normal/slightly elevated CK. Nonaka myopathy presents in early adulthood with anterior tibialis weakness, foot drop, and moderate CK rise.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier evaluation includes serum CK (often >5,000 IU/L) and EMG showing myopathic motor unit potentials. MRI of the lower limbs reveals selective fatty infiltration of posterior calves (6). Second\u2010tier testing consists of targeted genetic testing for DYSF mutations (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~100%) (7). Third\u2010tier confirmation involves muscle biopsy demonstrating absent dysferlin staining on immunohistochemistry and sarcolemmal disruption under electron microscopy. Pre-test probability in young patients with isolated calf myopathy and high CK exceeds 80%, rising to >95% after genetic confirmation.","management_principles":"There is no disease\u2010modifying therapy. Management is supportive: physical therapy to maintain range of motion, ankle-foot orthoses for gait stabilization, and avoidance of strenuous eccentric exercise to minimize muscle damage. Experimental approaches include gene replacement via AAV vectors and antisense oligonucleotides; early phase trials are underway (8). Multidisciplinary care involves neurology, physiotherapy, pulmonology for periodic respiratory evaluation, and genetic counseling.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual assessment should include manual muscle testing, timed function tests, and pulmonary function tests (FVC supine and upright). CK monitoring can track disease activity but correlates poorly with function. Orthopedic evaluation for contracture management is recommended every 1\u20132 years. Genetic counseling sessions should be offered at diagnosis and upon family planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. Posterior calf involvement with CK >3,000 IU/L is virtually pathognomonic for dysferlinopathy. 2. Dysferlin immunohistochemistry on muscle biopsy is key\u2014loss of sarcolemmal staining confirms diagnosis. 3. Anterior tibialis\u2010predominant weakness suggests GNE myopathy rather than Miyoshi. 4. Respiratory and cardiac muscle are typically spared in Miyoshi myopathy. 5. Avoid high-intensity eccentric exercise to limit CK spikes and myofiber damage.","references":"1. Miyoshi T, et al. Distal posterior calf muscle atrophy: novel autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy.

Multiple epidemiological series have shown that Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) typically presents in adults between the ages of 20 and 50, with approximately two-thirds of patients diagnosed by age 45. Option A is incorrect because MMN is exceedingly rare in children under 12. Option C is incorrect, as the incidence of MMN in individuals over 65 is low; most series report only 5\u201310% of cases in this group. Option D is likewise incorrect since, although some patients present between 45 and 65, the majority (about 66%) are younger than 45 at onset.","conceptual_foundation":"MMN is an immune-mediated, purely motor, demyelinating neuropathy characterized by asymmetric distal weakness without significant sensory loss. It is classified under immune-mediated neuropathies in the current ICD-11 and recognized by the Peripheral Nerve Society. Unlike chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), which often affects older adults, MMN has a younger age distribution. The median age of onset in published cohorts is approximately 40 years, and there is a male predominance of 2\u20133:1.","pathophysiology":"MMN features segmental demyelination and conduction block in motor nerve fibers, mediated by anti-GM1 antibodies in roughly 40\u201350% of patients. Binding of these antibodies to ganglioside GM1 at the nodes of Ranvier disrupts sodium channel clustering, leading to conduction failure without axonal degeneration in early disease. Complement activation contributes to local myelin injury. Over time, persistent conduction block may cause secondary axonal loss, leading to irreversible weakness.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with slowly progressive, asymmetric weakness of distal upper or lower limbs, often beginning in the hands. Muscle cramps and fasciculations occur in 40\u201360%. Sensory examination remains normal, distinguishing MMN from other neuropathies. Two-thirds of patients are male, and onset typically occurs between 20 and 50 years of age. Bulbar involvement is rare.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on electrophysiological demonstration of motor conduction block in at least two nerves, normal sensory nerve conduction, and exclusion of alternate causes. EMG/NCS sensitivity for conduction block in MMN is approximately 70\u201385%. Anti-GM1 antibody testing supports the diagnosis (sensitivity ~40\u201350%, specificity ~90%), but a negative result does not exclude MMN. MRI and nerve biopsy are reserved for atypical cases.","management_principles":"First-line treatment is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), with typical induction doses of 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days and maintenance dosing of 1 g/kg every 2\u20134 weeks. Clinical trials report improvement in strength in 70\u201380% of patients. Corticosteroids and plasma exchange are not effective and may worsen the disease. Long-term immunomodulation with subcutaneous immunoglobulin or rituximab has been used in refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored every 3\u20136 months with clinical strength testing (e.g., Medical Research Council scale) and serial electrophysiological studies if strength declines. IVIg dosing may be adjusted based on trough IgG levels and clinical response. Regular monitoring for treatment-related complications (e.g., thrombosis, renal dysfunction) is recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. MMN presents with pure motor conduction block and normal sensory studies. 2. Anti-GM1 antibodies are supportive but not required for diagnosis. 3. IVIg is the only evidence-based effective treatment; steroids worsen MMN. 4. Onset is typically in young adults, unlike CIDP. 5. Early treatment preserves strength by preventing secondary axonal loss.","references":"1. Simon NG, et al. Multifocal motor neuropathy: diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment.
