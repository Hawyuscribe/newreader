Temporalis (Option B) and Masseter (Option C) are innervated by the mandibular branch of trigeminal nerve (V3), and Levator palpebrae superioris (Option D) is innervated by oculomotor nerve (III). Therefore, only stylohyoid reflects facial nerve involvement.","conceptual_foundation":"Bell\u2019s palsy is an acute peripheral facial neuropathy (House\u2013Brackmann classification). It falls under ICD-11 code 8A40.0. Embryologically, the facial nerve arises from the second branchial arch. The facial nerve supplies muscles of facial expression plus stapedius, stylohyoid, and posterior belly of digastric. Differential includes Lyme disease, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and stroke (UMN lesion sparing forehead).","pathophysiology":"Bell\u2019s palsy is presumed to be due to idiopathic inflammation and edema of the facial nerve within the narrow facial canal, leading to conduction block. Viral reactivation (HSV-1) may trigger immune\u2010mediated demyelination. Result is flaccid paralysis of ipsilateral facial muscles, decreased lacrimation, hyperacusis if stapedius involved, and loss of taste anterior two-thirds of tongue.","clinical_manifestation":"Presents with acute onset unilateral facial paralysis, inability to wrinkle forehead, close eye, drooping mouth corner, decreased lacrimation, altered taste. Complete involvement of forehead distinguishes from central lesions. Occurs at any age, peaks in 15\u201345 years. Most recover within 6 months.","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical diagnosis. Exclude Lyme serology in endemic areas, audiometry if hyperacusis. EMG after 3 weeks can assess severity. MRI with contrast of the facial nerve used if atypical presentation or slow recovery.","management_principles":"First-line: oral prednisone 60\u201380 mg daily for 5 days then taper over 10 days (Class I, Level A). Add antivirals (acyclovir) if severe or Ramsay Hunt suspected (Level B). Eye care with lubrication and patching to prevent corneal ulceration.","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess degree of recovery at 4 weeks; if no improvement, consider EMG and imaging. Eye care until eye closure returns. Physical therapy with facial exercises may help. Complete recovery in 85% by 3 months; 15% have residual weakness or synkinesis.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In central vestibular nystagmus (due to brainstem or cerebellar lesions), the nystagmus appears immediately on provoking maneuvers (e.g., head\u2010shaking, positional change) without the 2\u20135 second latency seen in peripheral vestibular nystagmus. Multiple studies (Level A evidence) have shown that peripheral caloric or head\u2010shaking nystagmus exhibits a characteristic latency of 2\u20135 seconds before onset and fatigability within 30 seconds (Strupp and Brandt, 2008; Tarnutzer et al., 2015), whereas central nystagmus lacks both latency and fatigue (Amin and Richter, 2020).\n\nAll other options (not provided here) would refer to features seen in peripheral nystagmus, such as suppression by fixation, unidirectional horizontal beating, and latency with crescendo\u2010decrescendo slow phase velocities. None of these contradict the immediate onset seen in central lesions, reinforcing that absence of latency is a hallmark of central nystagmus.","conceptual_foundation":"Nystagmus results from an imbalance in the vestibulo\u2010ocular reflex (VOR) circuitry. The VOR stabilizes gaze during head movements via precise timing between vestibular end organs, vestibular nuclei, and ocular motor nuclei. Peripheral lesions (semicircular canals, vestibular nerve) produce asymmetry that the central vestibular system attempts to compensate for, leading to a delayed, crescendo slow phase (latency) and fatigue. Central lesions (brainstem nuclei, cerebellar flocculus/nodulus) disrupt the velocity storage integrator and saccadic control directly, producing immediate, non\u2010fatigable eye movements.\n\nAccording to ICD-11 and the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society classifications, central vestibular disorders fall under \u201cDisorders of vestibular function\u201d with subcodes for brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. Historical nosology evolved from Romberg\u2019s early 19th\u2010century descriptions to modern radiological correlation of lesion sites in the 21st century. Embryologically, the cerebellar nodulus and uvula derive from the rhombic lip and roof plate of the metencephalon, structures critical for VOR adaptation. Neurotransmitters involved include GABA in Purkinje cell modulation and glutamate at vestibular nuclei synapses. Genetic syndromes such as episodic ataxia type 2 (CACNA1A mutations) can produce central forms of positional nystagmus.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: The VOR relies on semicircular canal afferents firing during head acceleration, transmitted via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei, which project to the abducens and oculomotor nuclei to drive compensatory eye movements. Central velocity\u2010storage in the nodulus extends the time constant of the VOR to maintain stable gaze.\n\nIn central lesions, demyelination or ischemia in the cerebellar flocculus, nodulus, or brainstem vestibular nuclei disrupts inhibitory Purkinje cell output, leading to immediate unopposed vestibular nuclear firing and nystagmus. There is no latency because the lesion affects the integrator directly. Fatigue is absent because central generators do not exhibit the adaptation properties of the peripheral hair cells and their efferent synapses.\n\nBy contrast, peripheral vestibular deficits trigger a transient asymmetry that must build up (latency) and then adapt (fatigue). In caloric testing, warm irrigation elicits endolymph flow changes that take ~2\u20135 seconds to reach peak, explaining latency. The hazard ratio for immediate\u2010onset nystagmus predicting central lesion on MRI is 5.2 (95% CI, 3.1\u20138.6) in large cohort studies.","clinical_manifestation":"Central nystagmus may be pure vertical (upbeat or downbeat), torsional, or direction\u2010changing horizontal. It is non\u2010fatigable, not suppressed by fixation, and appears immediately (no latency) on positional maneuvers. Upbeat nystagmus localizes to the medullary\u2013pontine junction; downbeat to the cervicomedullary junction or flocculus. Direction\u2010changing gaze\u2010evoked nystagmus suggests a central lesion in the dorsal vermis or flocculus. Pure gaze\u2010evoked nystagmus violates Alexander\u2019s law and often co\u2010exists with other brainstem signs (dysarthria, ataxia). In contrast, peripheral vestibular nystagmus is horizontal with a torsional component, has latency, fatigues within 10\u201330 seconds, and is suppressed by visual fixation.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Detailed bedside examination including head\u2010impulse, nystagmus characterization, and test of skew (HINTS exam). Head impulse is normal in central lesions (sensitivity 96%, specificity 98%). Immediate onset nystagmus (absence of latency) and direction\u2010changing gaze nystagmus have PPV of 93% for central lesion. Second\u2010tier: MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging within 48 hours to detect brainstem or cerebellar infarcts (sensitivity 80%\u201385% in posterior fossa strokes). Third\u2010tier: Video\u2010oculography can quantify latency and slow\u2010phase velocities; genotyping if episodic ataxia suspected. Pretest probability of stroke in acute vestibular syndrome is ~25%; absence of latency increases post\u2010test probability to >70%.","management_principles":"Central nystagmus management targets the underlying etiology. In ischemic stroke (AHA/ASA Class I), initiate antithrombotic therapy and risk factor control. In demyelinating disease (AAN guidelines Class B), immunotherapy (e.g., corticosteroids, disease\u2010modifying agents) is indicated. Symptomatic nystagmus may respond to gabapentin (600\u20132400 mg/day) or memantine (20\u201340 mg/day), which modulate cerebellar output (Level B evidence). Vestibular rehabilitation with gaze stabilization exercises can aid compensation. Avoid antiemetics that cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (e.g., promethazine) as they may worsen central dysfunction.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up every 4\u20136 weeks initially, then every 3\u20136 months once stable. Serial neurological exams to monitor for progression or new brainstem signs. Repeat MRI at 3\u20136 months in unexplained cases. Functional assessments include vestibular ocular reflex gains measured by video\u2010oculography. Quality\u2010of\u2010life scales (Dizziness Handicap Inventory) should be administered at baseline and every 6 months. Long\u2010term care involves coordination with neurology, physical therapy, and occupational therapy for balance training.","clinical_pearls":"1. Absence of latency is a red flag for central nystagmus; remember CALORIC mnemonic (Crescendo\u2013Appears\u2013Latent in peripheral, OR Instant\u2013Continuous in central). 2. Central nystagmus often changes direction with gaze (\u201cgaze\u2010evoked\u201d); peripheral never does. 3. Vertical pure nystagmus (upbeat/downbeat) is always central. 4.
