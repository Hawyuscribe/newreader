Dysferlinopathy. Miyoshi myopathy, a dysferlinopathy, presents in young adults with early calf\u2010dominant weakness leading to inability to plantar flex, with CK elevations up to 50\u00d7 normal. Option B: no other options provided. The finding of 35\u00d7 CK and posterior thigh and calf weakness is classic for dysferlin deficiency. Dysferlin gene (DYSF) mutations confirmed in >95% of Miyoshi myopathy cases (Bashir et al. 1998).","conceptual_foundation":"Dysferlinopathies are autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies, including Miyoshi myopathy and limb\u2010girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B). In ICD-11, classified under LGMD. Dysferlin is a membrane repair protein in muscle fibers. Differential includes LGMD1, FSHD, metabolic myopathies, and inflammatory myopathies. Presents after adolescence, unlike Duchenne which begins in childhood.","pathophysiology":"DYSF mutations impair sarcolemmal repair after microinjury, leading to progressive myofiber necrosis and replacement by fat and fibrosis. The pathologic hallmark is absence of dysferlin on immunohistochemistry and reduction on western blot. Inflammatory infiltrates may mimic polymyositis but immunosuppressive therapies are ineffective.","clinical_manifestation":"Miyoshi myopathy presents between ages 15\u201330 with initial calf weakness and high\u2010arched feet. Patients report difficulty on tip\u2010toe walking. Progressive involvement of posterior thigh muscles leads to Gowers\u2019 sign. CK can exceed 10,000 U/L. Cardiac involvement is rare. LGMD2B variant has prominent proximal weakness.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis: immunohistochemistry for dysferlin on muscle biopsy shows absent membrane staining; confirm with genetic testing of DYSF (>95% detection). EMG shows a myopathic pattern. MRI of lower limbs shows selective involvement of gastrocnemius and hamstrings. Pretest probability based on typical phenotype >80%.","management_principles":"No curative therapy. Supportive management includes physiotherapy, orthotics, and assistive devices. Avoid steroids as they are ineffective. Research into gene therapy and membrane repair enhancers is ongoing. Monitor for secondary contractures and osteoporosis.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neuromuscular follow\u2010up every 6\u201312 months with strength testing and functional scales (North Star, 6MWT). Monitor respiratory function annually; dysferlinopathies rarely cause respiratory failure. Address mobility aids and fall prevention.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early calf weakness with high CK suggests dysferlinopathy. 2. Muscle biopsy shows absent dysferlin. 3. Autosomal recessive inheritance; counsel siblings. 4.

In brachial plexus injuries presenting with shoulder pain and weakness in the arm and forearm, the upper trunk (C5\u2013C6) is most commonly injured as seen in Erb\u2013Duchenne palsy. Option B (Lower trunk) causes hand and grip weakness, and Option C (Upper and lower trunk) describes pan-plexopathy, which is less common.","conceptual_foundation":"The brachial plexus is organized into roots, trunks, divisions, cords, and branches. The upper trunk is formed by C5\u2013C6 roots and gives rise to nerves supplying proximal shoulder and arm muscles. Compression or stretch injuries at birth or from trauma often affect the upper trunk first.","pathophysiology":"Traction or compression of the C5\u2013C6 nerve roots disrupts axonal continuity in the upper trunk, leading to Wallerian degeneration distally in nerves such as the musculocutaneous, axillary, and suprascapular nerves.","clinical_manifestation":"Presentation includes the arm held in internal rotation with extended elbow and pronated forearm. Shoulder abduction and external rotation, elbow flexion, and supination are weak. Hand function is relatively spared.","diagnostic_approach":"Physical exam demonstrates specific myotomal deficits. MRI neurography or ultrasound can localize trunk lesions.

Myotonic dystrophy (B) exhibits a warm-up phenomenon where stiffness improves with repetition. Multiple sclerosis (C) causes spasticity rather than true myotonia. ALS (D) presents with weakness and fasciculations, not exercise-induced stiffness.","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita is an autosomal dominant sodium channelopathy caused by SCN4A mutations leading to impaired fast inactivation of the Nav1.4 channel. Symptoms typically begin in infancy or childhood with muscle stiffness triggered by cold or exertion.","pathophysiology":"Mutations in SCN4A disrupt the inactivation gate of skeletal muscle sodium channels, causing sustained depolarization and repetitive firing. Cooling slows channel kinetics further, exacerbating myotonia with continued activity (paradoxical phenomenon).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report muscle stiffness within seconds of exercise, especially in cold conditions, with eyelid and facial involvement common. Episodes can lead to transient weakness and recovery over minutes to hours. CK is usually normal to mildly elevated.","diagnostic_approach":"EMG demonstrates myotonic discharges that increase in frequency and amplitude with repeated stimulation and cooling. Genetic testing confirming SCN4A mutations secures diagnosis. Forearm cooling test may reproduce clinical stiffness.","management_principles":"Avoidance of cold and strenuous exercise in cold environments is essential. Mexiletine (200\u2013400 mg/day) reduces myotonia severity (Class IIa, Level B evidence). Other sodium channel blockers (e.g., lamotrigine) may be used off-label.","follow_up_guidelines":"Periodic assessment of functional status and ECG monitoring if on mexiletine. Patient education on trigger avoidance and heat therapy techniques is critical.","clinical_pearls":"1. Paradoxical myotonia worsens with repeated activity and cold; warm-up phenomenon rules out paramyotonia. 2. SCN4A gene testing confirms diagnosis. 3.

He has very high CK levels, and a muscle biopsy showed eosinophils. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Calpainopathy"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"The provided option is incorrect","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Calpainopathy) is incorrect. Calpainopathy (LGMD2A) typically presents in adolescence or early adulthood with pelvic girdle and proximal limb weakness, spared scapular winging initially, and muscle biopsies show non\u2010specific dystrophic changes without prominent eosinophilic infiltration. Eosinophils in muscle biopsy are characteristic of eosinophilic myositis or hypereosinophilic syndrome involving muscle, not calpainopathy. Common misconceptions include attributing high CK to any muscular dystrophy and assuming all limb\u2010girdle weakness equals calpainopathy, but the key finding of eosinophils points to inflammatory or parasitic etiologies. No provided option matches eosinophilic myositis, so the single option is incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Scapular winging arises from serratus anterior or trapezius dysfunction. Elevated CK indicates muscle fiber necrosis. Eosinophils in biopsy reflect a localized eosinophilic inflammatory response seen in eosinophilic myositis or parasitic infection (eg, trichinosis). Muscular dystrophies like calpainopathy are genetic disorders of proteolysis without inflammatory infiltrates of eosinophils. Classification systems (ICD-11) separate dystrophies (MGSD) from inflammatory myopathies (M60.x). Eosinophilic myositis belongs to the group of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies characterized by tissue eosinophilia, differing from polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle homeostasis involves protease regulation by calpain and calpastatin. In calpainopathy, CAPN3 mutations lead to sarcomeric instability and fiber degeneration without eosinophilic infiltration. In eosinophilic myositis, Th2 cytokines drive eosinophil chemotaxis via IL-5 and eotaxin, leading to eosinophil degranulation, cytotoxic major basic protein release, and muscle fiber necrosis. The resultant necrosis elevates CK. The inflammatory cascade is absent in primary dystrophies.","clinical_manifestation":"Eosinophilic myositis presents with subacute muscle pain, swelling, weakness, often with peripheral blood eosinophilia. Scapular winging can occur if shoulder girdle muscles are involved. CK elevations are typically high (>1,000 IU/L). Calpainopathy presents with chronic painless weakness, calf pseudohypertrophy, and minimal muscle inflammation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line labs include CBC with differential (eosinophils), CK, ESR/CRP. MRI of muscle shows edema in inflammatory myopathies. Muscle biopsy in eosinophilic myositis shows endomysial and perimysial eosinophils; in calpainopathy, biopsy shows fiber size variation, necrosis, regeneration, without prominent eosinophils. Genetic testing for CAPN3 mutations confirms calpainopathy.","management_principles":"Eosinophilic myositis is treated with high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppression (azathioprine, methotrexate). Calpainopathy has no disease-modifying therapy; management is supportive with physiotherapy, contracture prevention. Immunosuppression is ineffective in dystrophies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor strength, CK levels, eosinophil counts monthly during induction, then taper steroids based on clinical response. In calpainopathy, monitor respiratory and cardiac function annually and adjust supportive measures.","clinical_pearls":"1. Eosinophils on muscle biopsy strongly suggest an inflammatory myopathy rather than dystrophy.\n2. Scapular winging can be inflammatory or dystrophic; biopsy findings differentiate.\n3. High CK is non-specific; correlate with inflammatory markers.\n4. Genetic testing is confirmatory for calpainopathy; biopsy guides inflammatory vs. dystrophic pathology.\n5.

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), electromyography (EMG) commonly demonstrates spontaneous muscle fiber discharges manifesting as fasciculations, reflecting hyperexcitability of anterior horn cells. Multiple studies report fasciculation potentials in 80\u201395% of patients with early ALS. Option B (Prolonged F waves) may be seen in demyelinating neuropathies but is neither sensitive nor specific for ALS. Option C (Increased sensory action potentials) is incorrect because sensory nerve action potentials are typically normal in ALS, which is a pure motor neuron disorder without primary sensory involvement. Option D (Normal findings) is incorrect\u2014EMG is rarely normal in symptomatic ALS patients and usually shows denervation and reinnervation changes in multiple muscles.","conceptual_foundation":"ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting both upper motor neurons in the cortex and lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. It is classified under ICD-11 code 8A40 (motor neuron disease). Differential diagnoses include multifocal motor neuropathy, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, and spinal muscular atrophy. ALS was first described by Charcot in 1869; the El Escorial criteria (1994, revised 2015) remain the standard for diagnosis, requiring evidence of lower and upper motor neuron dysfunction in multiple body regions without sensory findings.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor neuron physiology relies on balanced glutamatergic transmission and trophic support. In ALS, glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein aggregation (notably TDP-43 inclusions) drive motor neuron death. Loss of motor neurons leads to muscle denervation, fasciculations, and eventual atrophy. Astrocyte and microglial activation contribute to a proinflammatory milieu, exacerbating neuronal injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with ALS present with asymmetric limb weakness, muscle cramps, and fasciculations. Bulbar onset occurs in 25% of cases with dysarthria and dysphagia. Limb\u2010onset ALS often begins in the hands (68%) with weakness of finger extension and grip. Reflexes may be brisk, and Babinski sign is common. Sensory examination is preserved, differentiating ALS from neuropathies. Median survival is 3\u20135 years from symptom onset without intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic workup for suspected ALS includes detailed EMG/NCS demonstrating widespread denervation (fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves) and fasciculations in at least three limbs or two limbs plus bulbar muscles, with preserved sensory studies. MRI of the cervical spine and brain excludes structural lesions. Laboratory tests (e.g., serum B12, TSH) rule out mimics. The Gold Coast criteria (2020) simplify diagnosis by combining clinical and EMG findings without strict region counts.","management_principles":"Riluzole is recommended at 50 mg twice daily (Class I, Level A) to modestly prolong survival (~3 months). Edaravone infusions (60 mg/day for 14 days of a 28-day cycle) may slow functional decline in early ALS (Class IIb). Multidisciplinary care including physical therapy, nutritional support, and respiratory management improves quality of life and survival. Noninvasive ventilation is indicated when FVC\u2009<\u200950% predicted.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require follow-up every 3\u20136 months for pulmonary function tests (FVC, SNIP), nutritional assessment (weight, dysphagia), and ALS Functional Rating Scale\u2013Revised (ALSFRS-R). Early referral for speech therapy, gastrostomy, and noninvasive ventilation is guided by declining bulbar or respiratory metrics. Palliative care involvement should begin when respiratory compromise or nutritional decline accelerates.","clinical_pearls":"1. Fasciculations on EMG with normal sensory studies strongly point to ALS rather than peripheral neuropathy. 2. Preservation of sensory nerve action potentials differentiates ALS from demyelinating neuropathies. 3. Early multidisciplinary care extends survival and maintains function. 4. Riluzole\u2019s survival benefit is modest\u2014patients should not delay its initiation. 5. Noninvasive ventilation significantly improves both quality of life and survival when FVC falls below 50%.","references":"1. Brooks BR, et al.
