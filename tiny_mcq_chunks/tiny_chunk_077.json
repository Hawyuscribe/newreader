Bilateral anterior and posterior circulation infarcts strongly suggest a central embolic source, most often cardioembolism. A negative TTE and TEE do not exclude paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Trials such as EMBRACE (Lancet. 2015;386(10008):2464\u20132472) showed that 30-day event monitoring post-cryptogenic stroke increases AF detection to 16.1% versus 3.2% in controls (difference 12.9%, 95% CI 7.4\u201318.4, p<0.0001).

In NASCET, symptomatic patients with 70\u201399% ICA stenosis randomized to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) had an 18-month stroke/death rate drop from 26.0% with medical therapy alone to 9.0% post-CEA (absolute risk reduction 17%, relative risk reduction ~65%, p<0.001) (NASCET 1991). Pathophysiologically, high-grade plaque burden causes hemodynamic compromise and cholesterol\u2010rich microembolization; CEA removes the nidus, restores laminar flow, and stabilizes endothelium. Common misconception: confusing ECST and ACAS trial percentages. Option B (From 22.2% to 15.7%): Incorrect. Those numbers approximate pooled risk in moderate (50\u201369%) ipsilateral stenosis over 2 years in NASCET (not 70\u201399%), where benefit was less pronounced (~6.5% ARR) (NASCET Subgroup Analysis 1998). Clinically, one might consider revascularization in moderate stenosis if recurrent TIA despite best medical therapy, but stroke reduction is smaller. Option C (From 14.9% to 26.5%): Incorrect and inverted; suggests harm. This resembles data in asymptomatic moderate stenosis in ECST where medical therapy alone had lower risk than early surgical series. Option D (From 11% to 5.1%): Incorrect for symptomatic 70\u201399%; these figures resemble ACAS asymptomatic cohort (5-year risk reduction) rather than 18-month symptomatic data. Misconception arises from mixing symptomatic trial endpoints with ACAS asymptomatic ones. Only A matches the 18-month, symptomatic 70\u201399% NASCET primary endpoint.","conceptual_foundation":"The internal carotid artery (ICA) arises from the common carotid bifurcation at the C3\u2013C4 vertebral level, courses through the carotid canal, and supplies the anterior circulation including the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territories. Its adventitia abuts cranial nerves (glossopharyngeal, vagus, hypoglossal) and is closely related to the cavernous sinus. Embryologically, the ICA derives from the third aortic arch and dorsal aorta, while the external carotid originates separately, explaining potential anastomoses in collateral pathways. Physiologically, cerebral autoregulation maintains constant flow via myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms over perfusion pressures of 60\u2013160 mm Hg. Dysfunction in stenosis leads to ischemic penumbra formation. Related syndromes include hemispheric TIAs, watershed infarcts in border zones between MCA\u2013ACA. Historically, Eastcott, Pickering, and Rob first performed CEA in 1954, refining technique through Cold Knife and patch angioplasty over decades. Key landmarks\u2014carotid bifurcation, superior thyroid artery origin, and hypoglossal nerve crossing\u2014guide surgical exposure. The circle of Willis provides potential collateral compensation in high-grade stenosis, but anatomical variants in 50% of individuals limit adequacy, raising stroke risk. Recognition of these vascular and neural relationships is essential for both diagnostic imaging and safe surgical planning.","pathophysiology":"Atherosclerosis begins with endothelial dysfunction mediated by oxidative stress, LDL oxidation, and upregulation of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1). Monocyte diapedesis leads to foam cell formation, fatty streaks, and smooth muscle proliferation driven by PDGF and TGF-\u03b2. Plaque maturation involves a fibrous cap of type I collagen synthesized by smooth muscle cells, overlying a lipid-rich necrotic core containing cholesterol crystals, MMP-9, and apoptotic debris. Genetic factors include ApoE \u03b54 allele and familial hypercholesterolemia (LDL receptor mutations), following autosomal dominant patterns. Inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) activate MMPs, thinning the fibrous cap and predisposing to plaque rupture. Ruptured plaques expose collagen and tissue factor, triggering thrombin generation and platelet aggregation via GP IIb/IIIa receptors. Embolic showers from plaque surface occlude downstream arterioles in MCA territory, while high-grade narrowing (>70%) also causes hemodynamic ischemia in watershed zones. Collateral vessels via anterior and posterior communicating arteries initially compensate, but chronic hypoperfusion induces compensatory vasodilation until autoregulatory reserve is exhausted. Chronically, microglial activation and neuronal apoptosis propagate infarction. Over an 18\u2010month time course, unstable plaques yield recurrent events unless surgically removed.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptomatic high-grade ICA stenosis classically presents with transient monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax), hemispheric TIA (contralateral limb weakness, dysarthria, aphasia), or completed ischemic stroke. Symptom onset to peak usually within seconds to minutes; deficits resolve in <24 hours in TIA or persist if infarction occurs. Neurological exam may reveal contralateral pronator drift, facial droop, hemispatial neglect (right ICA), or global aphasia (left ICA). In pediatric populations, congenital carotid anomalies may mimic stenosis but stroke remains rare; in elderly (>75 years), collateral insufficiency increases risk of watershed infarcts and silent white matter changes. Women may present more often with nonfocal symptoms (dizziness, confusion). Systemic hypertension and diabetes amplify endothelial injury. Severity is graded by NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores: mild (1\u20134), moderate (5\u201315), severe (>16). Red flags include crescendo TIAs (\u22652 events in 1 week), crescendo amaurosis fugax, and focal deficits upon minimal exertion. Unmanaged, 70\u201399% stenosis carries a 26% risk of stroke or death within 18 months; highest within first 2 weeks (~10%) without intervention, emphasizing urgent evaluation. Natural history without treatment shows progressive plaque growth and escalating embolic risk.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

Randomized trials and observational studies demonstrate that vitamin K antagonists reduce the risk of recurrent embolism by approximately 70\u201380% in this setting (Hart et al. 2014). NOACs lack robust data for left\u2010ventricular thrombus and are not FDA\u2010approved for this indication. Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel do not sufficiently inhibit thrombin formation or address the high embolic risk from a cardiac source and are inferior to anticoagulation in preventing recurrent cardioembolic events.","conceptual_foundation":"Cardioembolic stroke results from thrombi formed in the heart\u2014commonly in the left atrium, ventricle, or on valves\u2014that embolize to cerebral arteries. In ICD-11 it is classified under \u2018Ischemic stroke, subtype: Cardioembolic\u2019 (Code 8B01.Z). Intracardiac thrombus formation stems from Virchow\u2019s triad: stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability. Echocardiographic detection of thrombus places patients into a high\u2010risk category that mandates systemic anticoagulation to prevent recurrence.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, laminar blood flow and intact endothelium prevent thrombosis. In regions of stasis\u2014such as akinetic or hypokinetic ventricular segments\u2014platelet aggregation and activation of the coagulation cascade lead to fibrin\u2010rich clot formation. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, reducing synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, thereby preventing thrombus propagation and embolization. Platelet inhibitors do not influence the fibrin\u2010rich thrombi typical of low\u2010flow cardiac chambers.","clinical_manifestation":"Cardioembolic stroke often presents with sudden onset of maximal neurological deficit, frequently accompanied by cortical signs such as aphasia or hemianopia. Patients with intracardiac thrombus may have risk factors including dilated cardiomyopathy, recent myocardial infarction with wall motion abnormalities, or prosthetic valves. Without anticoagulation, recurrence rates approach 12% per year.","diagnostic_approach":"Confirm ischemic stroke with CT or MRI. Evaluate cardiac source with transthoracic and, if negative or suboptimal, transesophageal echocardiography to visualize intracardiac thrombus.

Pathogenic variants lead to granular osmiophilic material deposition in vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in small vessel pathology with recurrent subcortical ischemic events and leukoencephalopathy (Joutel et al., 1996). NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 mutations cause Alagille syndrome and Hajdu\u2013Cheney syndrome respectively, while NOTCH4 has no known human disease association. Common board-level distractors include NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, but CADASIL is classically tied to NOTCH3. This is universally taught in vascular neurology and genetics of stroke.","conceptual_foundation":"CADASIL is an inherited SVD classified under ICD-11 9A23. It presents with migraine with aura, recurrent subcortical TIAs/strokes, cognitive decline, and mood disturbances. Histopathology shows arteriolar wall thickening and GOM deposition. It fits within hereditary small vessel diseases alongside CARASIL and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Differential includes MS, vasculitis, and mitochondrial encephalopathies. Embryologically, NOTCH signaling regulates vascular development; mutations impair vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation. Neuroanatomically, white matter tracts\u2014especially periventricular regions, external capsules, and anterior temporal lobes\u2014are most affected.","pathophysiology":"Normal NOTCH3 receptor function maintains vascular smooth muscle cell homeostasis via ligand-induced cleavage and nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain, regulating gene transcription. CADASIL mutations cluster in extracellular EGF-like repeats, leading to misfolded proteins and GOM accumulation. This disrupts cell\u2013cell adhesion, causes lumen narrowing, hypoperfusion, and chronic ischemia. The ischemic cascade activates glial scarring and axonal loss in subcortical white matter. Over time, progressive hypoxia results in lacunar infarcts, arteriolar wall thickening, and myelin pallor, manifesting as clinical strokes and cognitive impairment.","clinical_manifestation":"The mean age of onset is 45 years, with migraine in 30\u201340% and ischemic events in 60\u201380%.
