[{"question_number":"1","question":"What is the most common pediatric posterior fossa tumor?","options":["Ependymoma","Pilocytic astrocytoma","Medulloblastoma","Meningioma"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Medulloblastoma","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option C is correct. Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric posterior fossa tumor, accounting for approximately 20% of all childhood brain tumors and nearly 40% of posterior fossa neoplasms in children. Pilocytic astrocytoma is second-most common, and ependymoma follows. Meningioma is exceedingly rare in this age group.","conceptual_foundation":"Medulloblastoma (ICD-11: 2C71.0) is a WHO grade IV embryonal tumor arising in the cerebellar vermis. It belongs to the group of primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Molecular classification divides medulloblastoma into WNT-activated, SHH-activated, Group 3, and Group 4 subgroups, each with distinct genetic and prognostic profiles. Differential diagnoses include ependymoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, and brainstem gliomas.","pathophysiology":"Normal granule neuron precursors in the external granular layer of the cerebellum are regulated by SHH and WNT signaling during embryogenesis. Mutations causing activation of MYC (Group 3), SHH pathway components (PTCH1, SMO; SHH subtype), or \u03b2-catenin (WNT subtype) lead to uncontrolled proliferation and failure of differentiation, forming densely cellular tumors that invade the fourth ventricle and cisterns.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical presentation includes signs of increased intracranial pressure (headache, vomiting, papilledema), truncal ataxia, and cranial nerve deficits. Median age is 6\u20138 years; presentation may be more subtle in infants. Prognosis varies by molecular subgroup: WNT subtype has >90% 5-year survival, while Group 3 carries a 50\u201360% survival rate.","diagnostic_approach":"Contrast-enhanced brain MRI shows a midline vermian mass with heterogeneous enhancement, restricted diffusion, and possible metastatic seeding along CSF pathways. Spine MRI is indicated to assess drop metastases. Histopathology with molecular subgrouping (immunohistochemistry, DNA methylation profiling) confirms diagnosis and guides risk stratification.","management_principles":"Surgical resection aiming for maximal safe removal followed by craniospinal irradiation (23.4 Gy for standard-risk) and adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide). Molecular subgroup\u2013directed therapy is emerging: SHH inhibitors (vismodegib) in SHH-activated tumors. Supportive care includes hydration, hearing monitoring, and endocrine evaluation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial MRI brain and spine every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months until 5 years. Neuroendocrine, neurocognitive, and audiological assessments annually. Survivorship clinics address late effects of irradiation and chemotherapy.","clinical_pearls":"1. Midline vermian location in children favors medulloblastoma over pilocytic astrocytoma. 2. WNT subgroup has the best prognosis; consider de-escalation trials. 3. CSF cytology should be obtained pre-radiotherapy to detect metastases. 4. Proton therapy may reduce late radiation toxicity. 5. Hearing loss is a common chemotherapy complication\u2014monitor with serial audiograms.","references":"1. Northcott PA, Robinson GW, Kratz CP, et al. Medulloblastoma.

What is the associated malignancy?","options":["Breast","Colon","Thyroid","Ovary ## Page 10"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Breast","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Breast) is correct because adult opsoclonus\u2013myoclonus syndrome (OMS) is most commonly paraneoplastic and associated with breast carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma. Options B (Colon), C (Thyroid), and D (Ovary) are not typically linked to OMS. Ovarian teratoma is associated with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis rather than OMS.","conceptual_foundation":"Opsoclonus\u2013myoclonus syndrome presents with chaotic multidirectional saccades (opsoclonus) and myoclonic jerks. It is classified under ICD-11 8A81.0 (immune-mediated movement disorders). Paraneoplastic variants are most often seen with breast and small cell lung cancers in adults and neuroblastoma in children. Pathophysiology relates to immune cross-reactivity between tumor antigens and neuronal antigens.","pathophysiology":"Autoimmune targeting of cerebellar neurons, especially Purkinje cells and brainstem saccadic burst neurons, leads to disinhibition of ocular motor control circuits. Onconeural antibodies (e.g., anti-Ri/ANNA-2) may be present. Aberrant immune response to tumor antigens triggers neuronal dysfunction through complement activation and T-cell\u2013mediated cytotoxicity.","clinical_manifestation":"Presents subacutely with chaotic, conjugate multidirectional, involuntary eye movements; arrhythmic, stimulus-sensitive myoclonus of trunk and limbs; ataxia; and encephalopathy. Adults often report ataxia and dysarthria. Onset typically over days to weeks. Paraneoplastic in ~50% of adults.","diagnostic_approach":"Brain MRI is usually normal or shows cerebellar signal changes. CSF may show mild lymphocytic pleocytosis. Evaluate onconeural antibodies (anti-Ri). Full-body PET-CT or mammography should be performed to detect underlying breast carcinoma.","management_principles":"First-line treatment includes immunotherapy: high-dose corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange (Class IIb, Level C). Oncologic treatment of the underlying malignancy is essential. Rituximab or cyclophosphamide may be used in refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurology and oncology follow-up every 3 months with neurological exam and imaging of known tumor sites. Adjust immunotherapy based on clinical response. Regular neuropsychological assessments recommended due to cognitive effects.","clinical_pearls":"1. Adult OMS often paraneoplastic\u2014search for breast and lung cancers. 2. Opsoclonus differs from nystagmus by its multidirectional nature. 3. Anti-Ri antibodies are most commonly associated. 4. Early tumor resection and immunotherapy improve outcomes. 5. Pediatric OMS is linked to neuroblastoma, but adult OMS rarely involves that tumor.","references":"1. Pranzatelli MR.

Surgical resection, when feasible, significantly prolongs progression-free and overall survival (Weller et al. 2017). Option A, \"Pilocytic astrocytoma,\" is incorrect because pilocytic astrocytoma is a WHO grade I tumor with circumscribed borders, Rosenthal fibers, and excellent prognosis after gross total resection, not representative of diffuse astrocytoma grade II.","conceptual_foundation":"Diffuse astrocytoma grade II falls under the WHO classification of central nervous system tumors as an infiltrative infiltrating astrocytoma. In the ICD-11, it is coded as 2B10.0. These tumors often harbor IDH1/2 mutations and ATRX loss but lack 1p/19q codeletion, distinguishing them from oligodendrogliomas. Historically, grading evolved from purely histologic features to include molecular markers in the 2016 and 2021 WHO updates. Embryologically, astrocytes derive from neuroectodermal radial glia, and the tumor cells mirror this lineage, infiltrating along white matter tracts and perivascular spaces.","pathophysiology":"Normal astrocytes maintain blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and neurotransmitter homeostasis. In diffuse astrocytoma grade II, IDH mutation alters cellular metabolism, producing 2-hydroxyglutarate that drives epigenetic dysregulation. Loss of p53 and ATRX leads to impaired DNA repair and telomere maintenance. Tumor cells infiltrate surrounding parenchyma along myelinated tracts, explaining difficulty in achieving clean surgical margins and why resection improves outcomes by debulking tumor burden but rarely cures.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in the third to fourth decade with new-onset seizures (70\u201390%) or focal deficits depending on tumor location in frontal or temporal lobes. Headaches and cognitive changes occur less frequently. Natural history without treatment shows median survival of 5\u201310 years; gross total resection can extend median survival by 2\u20134 years compared with biopsy alone.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with T2/FLAIR hyperintensity and minimal contrast enhancement is the imaging hallmark. First-tier workup includes MRI with and without gadolinium (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~85%). Diffusion and perfusion imaging help differentiate from higher-grade gliomas. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathology and molecular profiling for IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion per current WHO guidelines (Louis et al. 2016).","management_principles":"Maximal safe surgical resection is first-line, with extent of resection correlating with improved survival (HR 0.54 for gross total vs. subtotal; Wijnenga et al. 2018). Adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide are recommended for residual disease or high-risk features (EANO guidelines 2017). Chemotherapy regimens follow PCV or temozolomide protocols, especially in IDH-mutant tumors.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI at 48\u201372 hours assesses extent of resection. Surveillance MRIs every 3\u20136 months for the first 2 years, then annually if stable. Clinical evaluation for seizure control and neurocognitive function at each visit. Long-term monitoring addresses radiographic progression and late treatment effects.","clinical_pearls":"1. Gross total resection significantly improves survival in diffuse astrocytoma II. 2. IDH mutation confers better prognosis and is a therapeutic target. 3. Seizures are the most common presenting symptom. 4. Contrast enhancement suggests malignant transformation. 5. 1p/19q codeletion exclusion confirms astrocytic lineage.","references":"1. Louis DN et al.
