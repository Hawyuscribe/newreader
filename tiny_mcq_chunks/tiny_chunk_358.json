The missing options do not offer an alternative that fits both the pathological and clinical picture. Other common traps include amyloid neuropathy or paraneoplastic neuropathy, but these lack true vessel wall necrosis and immune cell\u2013mediated vascular destruction.","conceptual_foundation":"Mononeuritis multiplex refers to asynchronous involvement of individual peripheral nerves and is classified under ICD-11 8A43. Etiologies include systemic vasculitis (e.g., PAN, microscopic polyangiitis, rheumatoid vasculitis), infections (e.g., leprosy), sarcoidosis, and paraneoplastic processes. Histopathologically, necrotizing vasculitis of endoneurial vessels with inflammatory infiltrates and fibrinoid necrosis is diagnostic of a vasculitic process.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, vasa nervorum supply oxygen and nutrients to peripheral nerve fibers. In vasculitic neuropathy, immune complexes or ANCA-mediated processes damage vessel walls, leading to fibrinoid necrosis, lumen occlusion, ischemia, and infarction of nerve fascicles. Monoclonal B-cell proliferation can be seen in certain paraneoplastic or lymphoproliferative vasculitides, compounding ischemic injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with painful, asymmetric sensory and motor deficits in a stepwise fashion affecting individual nerves (e.g., wrist drop, foot drop). Pain is often severe and burning. Constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss) and other organ involvement (renal, skin, GI) frequently accompany systemic vasculitis.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: nerve conduction studies show patchy axonal loss with reduced amplitudes and preserved velocities. CSF may be normal or show mild protein elevation. Laboratory workup includes ESR, CRP, ANCA panel, complement levels. Second-tier: nerve biopsy of a clinically affected site confirms necrotizing vasculitis. Third-tier: imaging (angiography) for medium-vessel involvement and tissue biopsy of other organs as indicated.","management_principles":"High-dose corticosteroids combined with cyclophosphamide induce remission in systemic necrotizing vasculitis (EULAR/ERA-EDTA 2018). Duration and intensity depend on severity; maintenance with azathioprine or methotrexate follows induction. In refractory cases, rituximab has shown efficacy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical deficits monthly, ESR/CRP every 4\u20136 weeks, and evaluate for relapse or treatment toxicity. Repeat NCS at 3- to 6-month intervals. Adjust immunosuppression based on disease activity and side effects.","clinical_pearls":"1. Mononeuritis multiplex in an older adult with systemic features is vasculitic until proven otherwise. 2. Nerve biopsy is gold standard; choose a clinically affected nerve with residual function. 3. ANCA positivity supports but does not confirm diagnosis\u2014biopsy is required. 4. Early aggressive immunosuppression prevents irreversible axonal loss. 5. Distal symmetric sensorimotor neuropathy without pain suggests non-vasculitic etiologies.","references":"1. Collins MP, Dyck PJ, Gronseth GS, et al.

OPMD presents in adulthood (usually after age 40) with progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness; ocular muscle involvement with ptosis and mild facial weakness are hallmark features. There are no other options provided, making OPMD the clear diagnosis based on ocular, facial, and proximal muscle involvement without fluctuating fatigability (which would suggest myasthenia gravis).","conceptual_foundation":"OPMD is an autosomal\u2010dominant myopathy caused by GCN trinucleotide repeat expansions in the PABPN1 gene on chromosome 14q11.2. It is classified under ICD\u201010 G71.1 (Muscular dystrophy) and manifests with symmetric ptosis, dysphagia due to pharyngeal muscle involvement, and mild proximal limb weakness. Differential diagnoses include myasthenia gravis, mitochondrial myopathies, and other late\u2010onset muscular dystrophies.","pathophysiology":"The pathogenic GCN expansion in PABPN1 leads to abnormal nuclear aggregation of polyalanine\u2010expanded protein, causing myonuclear filament formation, disruption of normal mRNA processing, and progressive myofiber degeneration. Unlike autoimmune NMJ disorders, there is no fluctuation or fatigability; instead, there is slow myofiber loss and replacement by connective tissue.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in their 40s\u201360s with slowly progressive bilateral ptosis, dysphagia (often requiring dietary modification), and mild proximal limb weakness. Facial weakness may be subtle. Respiratory muscles are usually spared until late. Bulbar symptoms (dysarthria, aspiration risk) develop microscopically over years.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line workup includes genetic testing for PABPN1 GCN repeat expansion.

Examination reveals hyporeflexia. He came to the ER and received potassium supplements, but later repeated the same attacks weekly. His potassium level is 2.6 (low). What is the most accurate management?","options":["Acetazolamide","Mexiletine","Spironolactone","Daily potassium dose ## Page 3"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Acetazolamide","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Acetazolamide is the correct management for recurrent hypokalemic periodic paralysis based on multiple randomized and observational studies demonstrating its efficacy in reducing attack frequency. As a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide induces a mild metabolic acidosis that stabilizes the muscle membrane potential and reduces the likelihood of hypokalemia\u2010induced depolarization block (Statland et al. 2018, Muscle Nerve). Mexiletine (Option B) is effective in myotonic disorders but has no proven benefit in periodic paralysis and its sodium channel blockade can worsen muscle weakness. Spironolactone (Option C) is a potassium\u2010sparing diuretic that may mitigate potassium wasting but has not been shown to prevent episodic paralysis and carries risks of hyperkalemia and endocrine side effects. Daily potassium supplementation (Option D) alone is inadequate for prophylaxis due to fluctuating serum levels, poor compliance, and risk of rebound hyperkalemia; guidelines (Tawil et al. 2015, AAN) recommend carbonic anhydrase inhibitors as first\u2010line prophylaxis (Level B evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is an autosomal dominant skeletal muscle channelopathy primarily due to mutations in the CACNA1S gene (voltage\u2010gated calcium channel) or SCN4A gene (voltage\u2010gated sodium channel). These mutations cause aberrant gating pore currents, leading to membrane depolarization and reduced excitability when extracellular potassium falls. HypoPP is classified under ICD-11 code 8E83.10 and manifests as episodic flaccid weakness triggered by carbohydrate\u2010rich meals, rest after exercise, or stress. The condition\u2019s taxonomic evolution reflects the transition from purely clinical classification to molecular subtyping since identification of CACNA1S and SCN4A mutations in the 1990s. Embryologically, channel expression begins in myotubes; aberrant development of sarcolemmal ion channels predisposes to episodic attacks. Key neuroanatomical correlates include skeletal muscle fiber membranes (sarcolemma), t\u2010tubule system, and Na+/K+ ATPase regulation. Genetic penetrance is variable; female carriers may be asymptomatic. Diagnostic criteria integrate clinical episodes, low serum potassium during attacks, and genetic confirmation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, skeletal muscle excitability depends on a stable resting membrane potential maintained by Na+/K+ ATPase and regulated by voltage\u2010gated ion channels. In HypoPP, gating pore currents through mutated CACNA1S or SCN4A channels allow aberrant inward leak currents during hypokalemia, causing paradoxical depolarization and inexcitability. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors induce a mild metabolic acidosis, shifting potassium intracellularly less severely during attacks and reducing gating pore current amplitude. Chronic acetazolamide therapy upregulates Na+/K+ ATPase and enhances buffering capacity. Compensatory responses include upregulation of other ion transporters and renal bicarbonate excretion. In contrast, spironolactone acts at the renal collecting duct and does not directly stabilize muscle membrane potentials. Mexiletine\u2019s blockade of fast sodium channels can exacerbate weakness by reducing sodium current further.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in adolescence or early adulthood with episodic flaccid paralysis precipitated by high\u2010carbohydrate meals, rest after vigorous exercise, or stress. Attacks last hours to days, often involve proximal muscles more than distal, and spare respiratory and bulbar muscles in mild cases, though severe episodes can impair respiration. Frequency ranges from monthly to daily. Between attacks, exam is normal. Hyporeflexia or areflexia may be noted during episodes. Serum potassium <3.0 mmol/L during attacks, with EKG changes (U waves, flattened T waves). Differential includes thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, familial hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, and Andersen\u2010Tawil syndrome. Natural history shows decreasing attack frequency with age but potential for fixed weakness with repeated episodes.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by documented hypokalemia during an attack and exclusion of secondary causes (thyroid, renal tubular disorders). First\u2010tier: serum electrolytes (potassium, magnesium), thyroid function tests, EKG. Second\u2010tier: genetic testing for CACNA1S and SCN4A mutations (sensitivity ~70\u201380%, specificity >95%). Third\u2010tier: provocative electrophysiology (long exercise test) and specialized muscle membrane studies in research settings. Pretest probability is high in typical cases; genetic confirmation guides family counseling. False negatives occur in ~20% of mutation\u2010negative cases; muscle biopsy is not routinely indicated.","management_principles":"Acute management: oral potassium chloride 20\u201360 mEq with ECG monitoring; intravenous potassium if severe (<2.5 mmol/L or arrhythmias). Prophylaxis: acetazolamide 250\u20131000 mg daily in divided doses (Class IIa, Level B AAN 2015) or dichlorphenamide 50\u2013100 mg twice daily (FDA\u2010approved). Monitor serum electrolytes, acid\u2013base status, and renal function. Avoid triggers: high\u2010carbohydrate meals, rest after heavy exercise, certain medications (\u03b22\u2010agonists, diuretics). Lifestyle modifications include bedtime protein snack and regular moderate exercise. Spironolactone (25\u2013100 mg daily) may be considered second\u2010line if acetazolamide not tolerated but with lower efficacy. Mexiletine is reserved for coexisting myotonia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up every 3\u20136 months: clinical review of attack frequency, medication side effects, serum electrolytes, renal function, acid\u2013base status. Annual ECG to monitor for arrhythmias. Pregnancy planning requires multidisciplinary care. Genetic counseling for families; periodic bone density assessment due to chronic acidosis. Monitor for fixed proximal weakness in long\u2010term.","clinical_pearls":"1. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce HypoPP attacks by inducing mild metabolic acidosis and stabilizing the resting membrane potential. 2. Prophylaxis is more effective than daily potassium supplements due to risk of rebound hyperkalemia. 3. EKG during attacks shows U waves and flattened T waves correlating with serum K+ levels. 4.

Fat pad biopsy. The gold standard for confirming systemic amyloidosis is tissue biopsy demonstrating amyloid deposits using Congo red staining with apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Abdominal fat pad aspiration offers a minimally invasive approach with reported sensitivity of approximately 80% for AL amyloidosis and specificity exceeding 90%. Option B (Immunofixation) detects monoclonal immunoglobulins in serum or urine but does not localize or confirm amyloid deposition. Option C (Protein electrophoresis) screens for paraproteinemia but lacks specificity for amyloid fibrils and only indicates the presence of an abnormal protein. No option D is provided.","conceptual_foundation":"Amyloidosis encompasses disorders characterized by extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar proteins adopting \u03b2-pleated sheet conformations. In AL (light-chain) amyloidosis, a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia produces excess monoclonal light chains that misfold and deposit in tissues. Differential diagnoses include ATTR (transthyretin), AA (serum amyloid A), and localized amyloidoses. The ICD-11 classifies AL amyloidosis under 'Classification of human amyloidosis'. Peripheral neuropathy with autonomic dysfunction and carpal tunnel syndrome often signals amyloid infiltration of nerve and synovial tissues. Historically, taxonomy evolved from organ-based descriptions to protein-type classification following mid-20th-century biochemistry advances.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, immunoglobulin light chains are cleared by the reticuloendothelial system. In AL amyloidosis, misfolded light chains aggregate into insoluble amyloid fibrils deposited extracellularly, disrupting tissue architecture. Peripheral nerve deposits in the endoneurium and vasa nervorum cause ischemic axonal degeneration, leading to painful neuropathy. Autonomic fibers are particularly susceptible, resulting in orthostatic hypotension and gastrointestinal dysmotility. Synovial amyloid accumulation in the carpal tunnel contributes to median nerve compression and syndromic presentation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with AL amyloidosis are typically aged 50\u201365 years. Peripheral neuropathy occurs in 15\u201335% of cases, characterized by painful dysesthesias in a stocking-glove distribution. Autonomic involvement manifests as orthostatic hypotension in up to 60% and gastrointestinal symptoms in half of patients. Carpal tunnel syndrome precedes systemic diagnosis in approximately 35%. Cardiac involvement with restrictive cardiomyopathy portends poor prognosis. Without treatment, median survival is 6\u201312 months.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation and serum free light chain assays. Definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy with Congo red staining and polarized microscopy. Abdominal fat pad aspiration biopsy is the preferred initial site due to accessibility and a sensitivity of 70\u201390% for AL amyloidosis. If the fat pad biopsy is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, biopsy of affected organs or peripheral nerve may be pursued. Mass spectrometry or immunohistochemistry identifies the amyloid fibril protein type.","management_principles":"Treatment aims to suppress the underlying plasma cell clone using regimens adapted from multiple myeloma, such as bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CyBorD). Eligible patients may receive high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation, yielding hematologic response rates of 50\u201360%. Daratumumab, an anti\u2013CD38 monoclonal antibody, has shown enhanced response rates in recent trials. Supportive care includes management of orthostatic hypotension, neuropathic pain, and surgical decompression for carpal tunnel syndrome.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes serial serum free light chain measurements every 1\u20133 months to monitor hematologic response. Cardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP, troponin) and echocardiography every 3\u20136 months assess organ response. Periodic neurologic evaluations track neuropathy progression and autonomic function. Surgical and symptomatic management of carpal tunnel syndrome should be re-evaluated based on symptom recurrence. Long-term surveillance extends beyond five years due to relapse risk.","clinical_pearls":"1. Abdominal fat pad biopsy is minimally invasive with high sensitivity for AL amyloidosis.\n2.
