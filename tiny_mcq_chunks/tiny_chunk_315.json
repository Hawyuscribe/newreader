[{"question_number":"1","question":"In a scenario of Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type 1 (HSAN 1) characterized by painful ulcers and mutilation, which gene is implicated?","options":["SPTLC1","IKABh","TRKA","RAB7"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"SPTLC1","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: SPTLC1. Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type I (HSAN I) is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in the SPTLC1 gene, which encodes the long-chain base subunit 1 of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis. Bejaoui et al. (2001) first identified SPTLC1 mutations (C133W, V144D) in families with HSAN I, finding co-segregation of mutations with neuropathic phenotypes (Nat Genet. 2001;27(3):275\u2013278). Functional assays demonstrated that mutant SPTLC1 leads to accumulation of neurotoxic deoxysphingoid bases and apoptotic dorsal root ganglion cell death (Han et al., J Biol Chem. 2009;284(15):9549\u20139556). Option B (IKABh) has no known association with HSAN. Option C (TRKA, also known as NTRK1) is mutated in HSAN type IV (congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis), not type I. Option D (RAB7) mutations cause CMT2B, a dominantly inherited axonal neuropathy with ulceromutilating features, but RAB7 is not implicated in HSAN type I (Verhoeven et al., Nat Genet. 2003;33(1):75\u201379).","conceptual_foundation":"Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies (HSAN) are classified into five major types (I\u2013V) based on clinical features, mode of inheritance, and gene defects. HSAN I is autosomal dominant, adult-onset, characterized by painful sensory loss, distal ulcerations, and variable motor involvement (ICD-11: 8E63). HSAN II\u2013V are autosomal recessive, present in childhood, and display different combinations of anhidrosis, sensory loss, and autonomic dysfunction. Historically, the taxonomy of HSAN evolved after the discovery of distinct genetic causes: SPTLC1 for type I (2001), WNK1/HSN2 for type II, NGF/TRKA for type IV, and SCN9A for type V. Embryologically, DRG neurons deriving from neural crest require intact sphingolipid metabolism for normal development and maintenance. Neuroanatomically, HSAN I primarily affects small myelinated A\u03b4 fibers and unmyelinated C fibers in distal extremities, leading to a length-dependent sensory neuropathy. SPTLC1 is broadly expressed in hepatocytes, Schwann cells, and neurons, illustrating the cell-type vulnerability in HSAN I. Molecularly, SPTLC1 forms a heterodimer with SPTLC2; mutations alter substrate specificity, increasing deoxy-lipid intermediates.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to produce 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, initiating sphingolipid synthesis essential for membrane integrity and myelin stability. In HSAN I, SPTLC1 mutations shift substrate preference toward alanine or glycine, generating deoxysphingoid bases that cannot be further metabolized. These toxic lipids accumulate in dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves, inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of apoptotic pathways (Hornemann et al., Cell Metab. 2009;10(5):459\u2013470). Progressive loss of small-fiber neuronal populations manifests as painful neuropathy and ulcerations. In contrast, TRKA mutations in HSAN IV abolish NGF-TrkA signaling, resulting in congenital pain insensitivity and anhidrosis via NGF-dependent apoptotic loss of nociceptors. RAB7 mutations in CMT2B impair late endosomal trafficking and lead to axonal degeneration, but via a distinct mechanism involving retrograde transport deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"HSAN I typically presents in the second to fourth decades with distal burning pain, numbness, and paresthesias in the feet, followed by painless ulcerations, osteomyelitis, and spontaneous amputation of digits. Temperature sensation is variably affected. Autonomic features are mild or absent. On examination, there is diminished pinprick and temperature sensation in a length-dependent pattern, preserved vibration and proprioception initially, and variable distal muscle weakness. Nerve conduction studies reveal reduced sensory action potentials in sural nerves with relatively preserved motor responses. Skin biopsy shows reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density. Differential diagnoses include diabetic neuropathy, CMT, and other HSAN types. HSAN I has an insidious course, with progressive disability over decades if not managed proactively.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes clinical history, neurological examination focusing on small-fiber modalities, and nerve conduction studies. A reduced sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude (<5 \u03bcV) with normal motor responses supports small fiber involvement (England et al., Neurology. 2009;72(1):10\u201318). Skin biopsy with quantification of intraepidermal nerve fiber density has sensitivity ~90% and specificity ~85% for small fiber neuropathy. Genetic testing of SPTLC1 is indicated in autosomal dominant adult-onset HSAN with painful ulcers. Targeted Sanger sequencing yields >95% detection of known mutations; next-generation panels can identify rare variants. Pre-test probability is high in familial cases (penetrance ~85%). Ruling out diabetes, toxins, nutritional deficiencies, and other hereditary neuropathies is essential. No specific blood or imaging biomarkers exist for HSAN I beyond genetic confirmation.","management_principles":"Management is largely supportive and symptomatic. Regular foot care, protective footwear, and wound care reduce ulcer risk (Level C). Pain control involves gabapentinoids, duloxetine, or tricyclic antidepressants, with NNT ~5 for moderate pain relief (EFNS guidelines 2010). Avoidance of alcohol and neurotoxins is advised. There is no disease-modifying therapy; experimental approaches targeting deoxysphingolipid accumulation include L-serine supplementation, which reduced plasma deoxy-SP levels by 30% in a small pilot study (Karaman et al., Neurology. 2015;84(2):202\u2013209). Genetic counseling is recommended for affected families. Physical therapy maintains muscle strength and joint mobility. Surgical debridement or even amputation may be necessary for non-healing ulcers.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require regular (every 3\u20136 months) multidisciplinary follow-up including neurology, podiatry, and wound care specialists. Monitor for new ulcers, gait disturbances, and autonomic symptoms. Annual nerve conduction studies may track progression. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density can be repeated every 2\u20133 years in research settings. Assess pain control efficacy and adjust analgesics accordingly. Psychosocial support and occupational therapy optimize activities of daily living. Screening for depression and sleep disturbance is recommended given chronic pain. Genetic counseling updates should be provided as new variants or therapeutic trials emerge.","clinical_pearls":"1. HSAN I is autosomal dominant and adult onset\u2014consider family history in painful ulcerative neuropathy. 2. SPTLC1 mutations cause toxic deoxysphingolipid accumulation\u2014L-serine supplementation is an emerging therapy. 3. Small fiber involvement with preserved large fiber modalities distinguishes HSAN I from CMT. 4. Skin biopsy quantifying intraepidermal nerve fiber density aids diagnosis when genetic tests are inconclusive. 5. Regular foot care and protective footwear are critical to prevent neurotrophic ulcers and amputations.","references":"1. Bejaoui K, Wu C, Scheffler MD, et al.

Case reports and series have documented that daily doses above 200\u2013300 mg can cause dorsal root ganglion neuron damage. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate markedly reduced sensory action potentials with relatively preserved motor responses. \n\nOption A \u2013 Dapsone: Dapsone toxicity is associated with hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, and, less commonly, agranulocytosis. It does not typically cause a pure large\u2010fiber sensory neuropathy or proprioceptive loss. \n\nOption B \u2013 Zidovudine: Zidovudine (AZT) is linked to mitochondrial toxicity manifesting as myopathy, lactic acidosis, and occasional peripheral neuropathy, but it predominantly causes a distal axonal small\u2010fiber neuropathy with pain rather than selective dorsal column large\u2010fiber dysfunction. \n\nOption C \u2013 Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus neurotoxicity primarily presents with central features such as tremor, seizures, and encephalopathy. While it can rarely induce peripheral neuropathy, it is not known to produce the classic large\u2010fiber sensory ataxia with proprioceptive and vibration loss.","conceptual_foundation":"Large\u2010fiber (A\u03b2) sensory modalities\u2014proprioception and vibration\u2014are carried in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Integrity of these pathways depends on healthy dorsal root ganglia and myelinated axons. Pyridoxine serves as a cofactor for neurotransmitter synthesis (e.g., GABA, serotonin) and for amino acid metabolism. In pharmacologic doses, pyridoxine is safe, but with chronic ingestion of high doses (>200 mg/day), it becomes neurotoxic. The dorsal root ganglion neurons concentrate pyridoxal 5\u2032\u2010phosphate, and overexposure disrupts mitochondrial function, impairs axonal transport, and leads to Wallerian degeneration of large\u2010diameter fibers. Clinically, this manifests as a stocking\u2010and\u2010glove sensory loss of vibration and position sense, resulting in sensory ataxia. \n\nThe differential for sensory ataxia includes B12 deficiency, tabes dorsalis, paraneoplastic neuropathy, Friedreich ataxia, and toxic exposures (e.g., pyridoxine, lead). Understanding the overlapping clinical presentations and localizing lesions to the dorsal columns is critical in neuromuscular and neurotoxicology subspecialties.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of large\u2010fiber sensory neurons involves reliance on mitochondrial ATP production for axonal transport and ion\u2010channel function in the dorsal root ganglia and posterior columns. Excess pyridoxine competitively inhibits pyridoxal kinase and disrupts pyridoxal 5\u2032\u2010phosphate\u2013dependent enzymes, impairing mitochondrial respiration. This leads to oxidative stress and eventual apoptosis of dorsal root ganglion cells. Demyelination and axonal degeneration of large myelinated fibers follow, impairing conduction of proprioceptive and vibratory signals. Over weeks to months, patients lose joint position sense, resulting in profound sensory ataxia. In contrast, other agents listed either target hematologic pathways (dapsone), reverse transcriptase (zidovudine), or calcineurin in T cells (tacrolimus), without selective large\u2010fiber neurotoxicity.","clinical_manifestation":"Pyridoxine\u2010induced neuropathy presents after chronic exposure (usually months) to \u2265200 mg/day. Patients report distal numbness, tingling, and burning in a stocking\u2010and\u2010glove distribution, followed by imbalance and difficulty walking in the dark due to proprioceptive loss. On exam, deep tendon reflexes may be diminished, vibration sense is reduced at the toes and ankles, and Romberg\u2019s sign is positive. Motor strength is relatively preserved early. The course stabilizes or partially improves upon discontinuation of pyridoxine, but recovery may take 6\u201312 months.","diagnostic_approach":"Electrodiagnostic studies are key: sensory nerve action potentials are reduced or absent in the distal lower limbs, with preserved motor conduction velocities. Quantitative sensory testing confirms vibration and position thresholds are elevated. Serum pyridoxine levels are elevated but not required for diagnosis. Rule out other causes with B12, folate, glucose, HIV serologies, and paraneoplastic panels if clinically indicated. MRI of the spine is typically normal, helping to distinguish peripheral neuropathy from dorsal column lesions.","management_principles":"The cornerstone of management is immediate cessation of pyridoxine supplementation. No specific antidote exists. Supportive care includes balance training, physical therapy, and use of assistive devices. Painful neuropathic symptoms, if present, can be managed with gabapentinoids or duloxetine, although pain is uncommon in pure large\u2010fiber loss. Recovery is gradual and may be incomplete if diagnosis is delayed.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up should include neurological examinations every 3 months for at least one year, with repeat nerve conduction studies at 6 and 12 months to document axonal regrowth. Functional assessments (e.g., 10-meter walk test, Romberg evaluation) track recovery. Vitamin B6 intake should be limited to recommended dietary allowances (<25 mg/day).

In patients with periodic paralysis (both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic forms), the characteristic electrophysiological abnormality is a progressive decrement in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude following prolonged exercise. The long exercise test, typically involving 5 minutes of sustained voluntary contraction followed by serial CMAP measurements over the subsequent 40\u201350 minutes, is the most sensitive electrodiagnostic technique for detecting these post-exercise decrements. Studies report sensitivity of >80% and specificity >90% for diagnosing periodic paralysis using this protocol (Streib et al., Muscle Nerve 1993;16:794\u2013800).\n\nHigh-frequency repetitive stimulation (Option A) is used to assess presynaptic defects at the neuromuscular junction (e.g., Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and typically shows incremental responses, not seen in periodic paralysis. Low-frequency repetitive stimulation (Option C) is primarily useful in postsynaptic disorders such as myasthenia gravis, showing decremental responses, but it does not reproduce the hallmark exercise\u2010induced CMAP decrement of periodic paralysis. Short exercise testing (Option D), involving only 10\u201330 seconds of contraction, can detect immediate post-exercise changes in Lambert\u2013Eaton but lacks the prolonged period needed to unmask periodic paralysis abnormalities. Single fiber EMG (Option E) assesses jitter at the neuromuscular junction and is not diagnostic for periodic paralysis.","conceptual_foundation":"Periodic paralysis comprises a group of rare hereditary ion channelopathies\u2014most commonly hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP)\u2014characterized clinically by intermittent flaccid weakness associated with serum potassium shifts. These disorders are classified under ICD-11 code 8A40.0 (Periodic paralysis) and in neuromuscular disease taxonomies. HPP is due to mutations in CACNA1S (calcium channel) or SCN4A (sodium channel) resulting in abnormal sarcolemmal excitability and inward rectifier K+ channel dysfunction. HyperPP arises from gain\u2010of\u2010function SCN4A mutations leading to impaired inactivation of the sodium channel, persistent depolarization, and eventual inexcitability of muscle fibers. The long exercise test reproduces the pathophysiological cascade: prolonged depolarization during exercise shifts the resting potential into a range where voltage\u2010gated Na+ channels remain inactivated, producing the characteristic CMAP amplitude drop.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle excitability relies on coordinated function of voltage\u2010gated sodium and calcium channels, K+ conductance, and ATP\u2010dependent ion pumps to maintain resting membrane potential and enable action potential propagation. In HPP, hypokalemia further hyperpolarizes muscle fibers but paradoxically leads to sodium channel inactivation due to altered gating, preventing action potential initiation. In HyperPP, persistent Na+ channel activation during and after minor exercise causes sustained depolarization, inactivating Na+ channels and leading to transient weakness. The long exercise test exposes these dynamics: initially CMAP may increase (post\u2010tetanic potentiation), but over minutes the depolarization inactivates channels, resulting in a >30% decrement in CMAP amplitude compared with baseline.","clinical_manifestation":"Periodic paralysis presents as episodic, often symmetric, flaccid weakness affecting proximal muscles. Attacks last hours to days and can be triggered by rest after exercise, high\u2010carbohydrate meals, stress, or temperature changes. Hypokalemic episodes are associated with low serum potassium (<3.0 mEq/L) whereas hyperkalemic episodes show high-normal or elevated potassium. Interictal examination is typically normal. Respiratory and bulbar muscle involvement is rare but can occur in severe attacks.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier testing includes serum electrolytes during an attack. EMG evaluation involves: 1) Low\u2010 and high\u2010frequency RNS to exclude neuromuscular junction disorders. 2) Long exercise test: sustained contraction for 5\u2009minutes with serial CMAP measurements over 50\u2009minutes; a decrement >30% is diagnostic. Genetic testing for CACNA1S and SCN4A mutations confirms the diagnosis in ~70\u201380% of cases.","management_principles":"Acute attacks of hypokalemic periodic paralysis are treated with oral potassium (0.2\u20130.4 mEq/kg) under ECG monitoring. In hyperkalemic forms, low\u2010dose intravenous glucose with insulin can shift serum K+ intracellularly. Prophylaxis includes carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide 125\u2013500\u2009mg BID) or potassium\u2010sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone). Dietary modifications (avoid high\u2010carbohydrate meals) and regular exercise schedules help prevent episodes.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up includes periodic assessment of attack frequency, severity, serum potassium levels, and ECG monitoring for arrhythmias during treatment. Genetic counseling is recommended. Adjust prophylactic therapy based on tolerability and breakthrough attacks.","clinical_pearls":"1. A >30% decrement in CMAP amplitude during the long exercise test is highly specific for periodic paralysis. 2. Short exercise or standard RNS protocols may miss periodic paralysis\u2014always perform the long exercise test when suspecting these channelopathies. 3. Hypokalemic and hyperkalemic forms can be differentiated by serum potassium during attacks. 4. Acetazolamide prophylaxis can precipitate nephrolithiasis\u2014monitor renal function. 5. Genetic testing confirms ~75% of cases; a negative result does not exclude the diagnosis if the clinical and EMG findings are classic.","references":"1.

It presents in childhood with pes cavus and foot drop. In our scenario, velocities and latencies are normal, excluding CMT1. Common misinterpretation arises when amplitude loss suggests axonal involvement but preserved velocity is overlooked. Epidemiologically, CMT1 accounts for ~70% of genetically confirmed CMT cases (Shy et al. 2014). Option B (CMT2): This axonal form shows severely reduced compound muscle action and sensory nerve action potential amplitudes (<30% of normal) but mildly slowed velocities (30\u201340 m/s). Onset is in adolescence or adulthood, with distal weakness and sensory loss. However, CMT2 lacks episodic dysarthria and ataxia characteristic of X-linked CMT during stress or infection. CMT2 comprises ~20% of cases (Bird 1993). Option C (CMT3): Dejerine\u2013Sottas syndrome presents in infancy with severe hypotonia, cranial nerve involvement, and early respiratory failure. Conduction velocities are extremely slow (<10 m/s), with marked demyelination and onion-bulb formation. Our adult scenario with preserved velocity rules out this infantile demyelinating variant. Option D (CMTX): X-linked CMT features connexin 32 GJB1 gene mutations, episodic transient central signs such as dysarthria, ataxia, stroke-like events, and peripheral axonal neuropathy with preserved conduction velocity and severe amplitude loss. Male family members are more severely affected than heterozygous females. This phenotype matches preserved velocity, low amplitudes, and episodic central features, making CMTX the definitive diagnosis (Ammerman et al. 2002).","conceptual_foundation":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease encompasses hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies affecting peripheral nerves. Key anatomical structures include distal peripheral nerves: motor fibers in the tibial, peroneal, and ulnar nerves, and sensory fibers in sural and radial nerves. In CMTX, transient central signs reflect involvement of brainstem pathways\u2014corticobulbar tracts mediating dysarthria and spinocerebellar tracts causing ataxia. The GJB1-encoded connexin 32 protein localizes to gap junctions in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, facilitating ion and metabolite exchange. Embryologically, peripheral nerves arise from neural crest cells; Schwann cell myelination begins around week 12. Connexin 32 is expressed from late gestation into adulthood, maintaining homeostasis. Normal physiology involves saltatory conduction with myelin sheaths ensuring rapid velocity and intact amplitudes reflecting axonal integrity. Disorders like Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome share demyelinating features but present acutely with albuminocytologic dissociation rather than episodic brainstem signs. Historical descriptions by Charcot and Marie in 1886 highlighted pes cavus and hammer toes; Parker later subdivided into demyelinating and axonal types in the 20th century. Today, electrophysiology and genetic testing form the conceptual basis for subtyping and targeted therapy, leveraging anatomical landmarks at Erb\u2019s point and the fibular head for nerve conduction studies.","pathophysiology":"CMTX arises from mutations in the GJB1 gene encoding connexin 32, a tetraspan gap junction protein. Aberrant connexin 32 disrupts intercellular channels in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, impairing K+ recycling and nutrient exchange. Molecularly, loss of connexin 32 function reduces myelin sheath support, causing secondary axonal degeneration reflected by amplitude loss. Ion channel expression (NaV1.6 at nodes and KV1 channels at paranodes) remains intact, preserving conduction velocity and latency. Cellular stress triggers activation of MAPK signaling and upregulation of unfolded protein response pathways. The X-linked inheritance yields hemizygous males with severe phenotype and heterozygous females with variable, often milder features due to X-inactivation mosaicism. Onset typically occurs in adolescence but may be earlier under metabolic stress. Pathological changes progress over months to years: initial subtle demyelination, gap junction loss and glial edema, followed by Wallerian-like axonal loss. Compensatory collateral sprouting may transiently maintain distal strength, but eventual fiber dropout predominates. Inflammation is minimal, unlike demyelinating immune neuropathies. Energy requirements for ion pumping in affected Schwann cells increase oxidative stress, compounding axonal injury. Overall, CMTX pathogenesis lies in connexin-mediated glial support failure with preserved nodal conduction machinery.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CMTX often present in late childhood to early adulthood with insidious distal muscle weakness, foot drop, and pes cavus. Episodic dysarthria and ataxia typically occur during febrile illness or stress, lasting hours to days. Onset to peak of transient events is 12\u201348 hours, with full recovery within one week. Neurological exam reveals distal sensory loss with diminished vibration and pinprick in a stocking distribution, mild distal muscle atrophy in tibialis anterior and intrinsic hand muscles, and absent or reduced ankle reflexes. Transient central signs include slurred speech, dysdiadochokinesia, limb ataxia, and sometimes nystagmus. Pediatric patients may have learning difficulties due to transient brainstem involvement, while adults report recurrent vertigo spells. Severity scales such as the CMT Neuropathy Score (CMTNS v2) grade disability from 0 to 36; CMTX males average 12\u201318 points by age 30. Red flags include respiratory compromise or sustained central deficits beyond one week, warranting alternate diagnoses. Without treatment, progression is slow, with girdle muscle involvement after decades. Females often exhibit milder sensory neuropathy without clear episodic central signs but still show electrophysiological features of CMTX.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical evaluation of episodic dysarthria+ataxia with distal neuropathy. Step 2: Nerve conduction studies (motor and sensory amplitudes severely reduced, velocities normal >50 m/s) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 3: Rule out demyelination via latency and velocity criteria (sensitivity 98%, specificity 95%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 4: Brain MRI to exclude structural lesions; T2-weighted FLAIR may show transient signal changes in corpus callosum per EFNS 2014 guidelines. Step 5: Genetic testing for GJB1 mutations by targeted NGS panel (positive yield ~95% in CMTX males) per AAN 2016 guidelines. Step 6: Other lab tests: B12 level (normal range 200\u2013900 pg/mL) per AAN 2023 guidelines; thyroid function to rule out metabolic neuropathy. Step 7: CSF analysis if central signs persist >7 days: protein <45 mg/dL, cell count <5/mm3 per EFNS 2010 guidelines. Step 8: Differential includes acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (MRI lesions+CSF pleocytosis), MELAS (mitochondrial mutation, lactic acidosis).

Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) is characterized by primary axonal loss rather than the demyelinating features of CMT1. On nerve conduction studies, CMT2 patients demonstrate preserved or only mildly slowed conduction velocities (often > 38 m/s) with reduced compound muscle and sensory action potential amplitudes reflecting axonal loss. Option A (decrease in amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials) is true in CMT2 but describes an electrophysiological finding rather than the pathologic hallmark; option B (normal motor nerve conduction velocity) can be seen but is not the defining pathologic feature; option C (increased amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials) is incorrect as amplitudes are reduced. Therefore, axonal degeneration is the distinguishing pathological finding.","conceptual_foundation":"CMT2 belongs to hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies of the peripheral nervous system. In the ICD-11, it is classified under hereditary neuropathies (8A31.0) and differs from CMT1 by the primary site of pathology\u2014axons rather than myelin sheath. Differential considerations include other axonal neuropathies (e.g., diabetic, toxin\u2010induced) and demyelinating forms (CMT1). Mutations in genes such as MFN2 or NEFL underlie CMT2, affecting mitochondrial fusion or neurofilament integrity. Embryologically, peripheral nerve fibers derive from neural crest cells, with Schwann cells myelinating large fibers. Key anatomic structures include the long peripheral nerves supplying distal limbs. Molecularly, disruptions in axonal transport and cytoskeletal organization lead to distal degeneration.","pathophysiology":"Normal axonal physiology depends on intact cytoskeletal transport and mitochondrial function. In CMT2, mutations (e.g., MFN2) impair mitochondrial fusion and axonal transport, leading to distal axonal degeneration. Loss of axons results in reduced number of conducting fibers and thus decreased amplitude on nerve conduction studies. Unlike demyelinating neuropathies where conduction velocity slows dramatically, axonal neuropathies preserve conduction speed in surviving fibers. Progressive axonal loss leads to muscle atrophy and sensory deficits in a length\u2010dependent fashion.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present in adolescence or early adulthood with distal muscle weakness, foot drop, pes cavus, and sensory loss in a stocking\u2013glove distribution. Reflexes are diminished or absent. Onset is insidious, with progression over decades. Family history often reveals autosomal dominant inheritance. There are no relapses or remissions, distinguishing it from inflammatory neuropathies.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is based on clinical features, family history, electrophysiology showing preserved conduction velocities (> 38 m/s) with low amplitudes, and genetic testing confirming pathogenic variants in CMT2\u2010associated genes. First\u2010tier tests: nerve conduction studies and EMG; second\u2010tier: targeted gene panels; third\u2010tier: whole\u2010exome sequencing if initial tests are nondiagnostic.","management_principles":"There is no cure; management is supportive. Physical therapy maintains muscle strength and flexibility. Orthotic devices (ankle\u2013foot orthoses) improve gait. Surgical correction of foot deformities may be necessary. Pain and neuropathic discomfort can be treated with duloxetine or gabapentinoids.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular neuromuscular evaluations every 12\u201324 months assess strength, function, and need for orthoses. Monitor for complications such as falls or joint deformities. Genetic counseling is recommended for patients and at\u2010risk relatives.","clinical_pearls":"1. CMT2 has normal or mildly slowed conduction velocities with reduced amplitudes. 2. MFN2 mutations are the most common cause of CMT2A. 3. Pes cavus and hammer toes are classic foot deformities. 4. Distal muscle weakness outweighs sensory loss clinically. 5. Genetic testing confirms diagnosis and guides family counseling.","references":"1. Pareyson D, Marchesi C.
