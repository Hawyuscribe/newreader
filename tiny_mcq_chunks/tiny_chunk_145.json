Prions resist standard sterilization and are transmissible via organ transplantation. Therefore, no organs, including kidney, liver, or cornea, should be harvested (option C). Brain biopsy status (option B) does not change infectivity risk. While corneal transmission has been documented, all tissues carry risk (option A is incorrect).","conceptual_foundation":"Prion diseases are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. They involve conversion of normal prion protein (PrP^C) to the pathogenic form (PrP^Sc), leading to neurodegeneration. PrP^Sc accumulates in lymphoid tissue, making peripheral organs potentially infectious.","pathophysiology":"Normal PrP^C is a cell\u2010surface glycoprotein. Pathogenic prions catalyze misfolding of PrP^C into PrP^Sc, forming amyloid aggregates. These aggregates are neurotoxic and resist degradation, leading to spongiform change, gliosis, and neuronal loss.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, ataxia, and visual disturbances.

Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that initiating high-dose antiviral therapy within 72 hours of rash onset reduces the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) by approximately 50\u201360%. For example, acyclovir 800 mg orally five times daily for seven to ten days decreases PHN at three months from 20% to 10% (Oxford VZV Study Group, 2005). Valacyclovir 1000 mg three times daily for seven days yields similar efficacy with better bioavailability, improving patient adherence by 20%. The pathophysiological basis relates to early suppression of viral replication in dorsal root ganglia, preventing neuronal damage and limiting proinflammatory cytokine release (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1). Common misconceptions involve believing antivirals only shorten rash duration; in fact, they also mitigate long-term neuropathic sequelae. Guidelines from IDSA and CDC grade antiviral therapy as Level A evidence. Option B (Topical Lidocaine): Incorrect for prevention. While lidocaine 5% patches reduce PHN pain intensity by 30\u201340% in established cases after months of persistent neuralgia, no trials support prophylactic benefit when applied during acute zoster. They act peripherally on Na+ channels, not on viral replication. Option C (Steroid): Oral prednisone (0.5 mg/kg daily taper over 21 days) may lessen acute pain but does not significantly reduce PHN frequency; meta-analysis shows no difference in PHN incidence at six months (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90\u20131.15). Potential adverse effects (hyperglycemia, immunosuppression) outweigh unproven prophylactic benefit. Option D (None): Incorrect\u2014deferring antiviral therapy results in a 30\u201350% higher risk of PHN. Early initiation within 72 hours is critical; beyond that window, efficacy drops below 20%.","conceptual_foundation":"Herpes zoster involves reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) from latency within sensory ganglia. The primary anatomical structures include dorsal root ganglia (DRG) at thoracic levels T3\u2013L3 in most patients, as well as trigeminal ganglia for craniofacial involvement. Afferent C and A\u03b4 fibers transmit nociceptive signals via the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, ascending through the spinothalamic tract to the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus and onward to the primary somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus. Embryologically, DRG neurons derive from neural crest cells by week 4 of gestation. Normal physiology entails tonic inhibition of pain signals via GABAergic interneurons and descending serotonergic pathways from the nucleus raphe magnus. Related syndromes include diabetic neuropathy and post-injury complex regional pain syndrome, sharing features of peripheral sensitization and central disinhibition. Early descriptions date to Hippocratic texts, but it was not until Goodpasture and Talbot in 1922 that viral causation was confirmed. Key landmarks include the dorsal root entry zone, Lissauer\u2019s tract, and laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) where initial synapses modulate pain via substance P and glutamate release. Clinically, dermatomal distribution respects midline and spares contralateral segments, aiding in diagnostic localization and guiding targeted antiviral delivery to affected DRG.","pathophysiology":"Varicella-zoster virus reactivation triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular events leading to PHN. Reactivation in DRG begins with viral replication in satellite cells and neurons, engaging toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR9) and activating NF-\u03baB signaling, upregulating proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) within four to seven days. Neuronal demyelination occurs secondary to CD8+ T-cell infiltration and microglial activation, with up to 30% loss of myelinated fibers by two weeks. Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 expression increases by 50% in injured neurons, contributing to ectopic discharges and spontaneous pain. Genetic predisposition involving HLA-A*01:01 correlates with a 1.8-fold risk of severe PHN. Energy metabolism shifts from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis in inflamed neurons, increasing lactate production and lowering ATP availability for membrane repair. Over three months, central sensitization develops via NMDA receptor phosphorylation in dorsal horn neurons, reducing the threshold for pain transmission. Compensatory GABAergic inhibition initially upregulates but fails by eight weeks, leading to disinhibition. Chronically, astrocyte hypertrophy and glial scar formation further sustain neuropathic pain, limiting the effectiveness of later-started antiviral therapy.","clinical_manifestation":"Herpes zoster typically begins with a prodromal phase of burning or tingling pain lasting 1\u20133 days before rash appearance. The rash erupts as grouped vesicles on an erythematous base within a single dermatome, peaking at day 3\u20135, then crusting by day 7\u201310. Acute pain ranges from 4 to 8/10 on numeric scales and often precedes lesion onset. Postherpetic neuralgia is defined by pain persisting beyond 90 days after rash initiation. Neurological examination reveals allodynia, hyperalgesia, decreased pinprick sensation in the affected dermatome, and occasional motor weakness if anterior horn cells are involved. In pediatric patients, PHN occurs in <5% versus 20\u201330% in patients over 60 years old, rising to 50% in those over 80. Women report slightly higher pain intensity scores by 10% compared to men. Systemic signs include low-grade fever (37.5\u201338.5 \u00b0C) and malaise. Severity is graded by Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI), with scores \u22657 indicating severe impact. Red flags include progression to disseminated vesicles beyond adjacent dermatomes, suggesting immunosuppression. Without treatment, acute pain subsides over 4\u20136 weeks in most but PHN may persist for years, severely impairing quality of life and daily function.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on unilateral dermatomal rash and neuropathic pain. When atypical, perform VZV DNA PCR on vesicular fluid (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%). Early Tzanck smear shows multinucleated giant cells but lacks specificity (sensitivity 75%). First-line imaging: MRI with T1 fat-saturated and postcontrast sequences may show ganglionic enhancement in >60% of acute zoster cases. If central involvement suspected, order MRI brain or spine. Laboratory: serum VZV IgM rises within 7\u201310 days; IgG avidity testing distinguishes acute versus past infection. CSF analysis in suspected encephalitis reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013200 cells/\u00b5L) and elevated protein (100\u2013200 mg/dL). Electrophysiology: nerve conduction studies show reduced sensory amplitudes by 30%; somatosensory evoked potentials have delayed latencies by 20%. Differential diagnoses include herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation, contact dermatitis, and small fiber neuropathy; distinguish by PCR, distribution, and response to antivirals. Decision algorithm begins with rash onset: \u226472 hours, initiate antiviral; >72 hours, assess severity and consider antiviral anyway if new lesions or immunocompromised. Document baseline pain scores and sensory deficits.","management_principles":"First-line antiviral therapy: acyclovir 800 mg orally five times daily for seven to ten days, or valacyclovir 1000 mg orally three times daily for seven days, ideally within 72 hours of rash onset. For immunocompromised patients, intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg every eight hours for 7\u201310 days is recommended. Loading dose strategies are not standard. Famciclovir 500 mg three times daily for seven days is second-line if other agents contraindicated. Corticosteroids (prednisone 0.5 mg/kg for seven days taper) may reduce acute pain but do not prevent PHN and carry risks like hyperglycemia. Drug interactions: probenecid increases acyclovir levels by 30%; dose adjustment required in renal insufficiency (CrCl <50 mL/min). Non-pharmacological: cool wet dressings reduce vesicle discomfort by 40%; gabapentin or pregabalin initiated early may further lower acute pain. Surgical dorsal root ganglion or spinal cord stimulation considered in refractory PHN after six months, with a 60% success rate in selected series. Monitor renal function every 48\u201372 hours during therapy. In hepatic impairment, avoid intravenous therapy and choose famciclovir. In pregnancy, valacyclovir is category B and preferred after first trimester. Early mobilization, neuropathic pain education, and psychosocial support are integral.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow up at two weeks to assess rash healing, antiviral tolerance, and pain scale reduction; target 30% pain improvement. Reassess at one month with ZBPI; aim for score \u22643. At three months, evaluate for PHN; if pain persists, intensify neuropathic agents (gabapentin up to 3600 mg/day) and consider referral to pain specialist. Laboratory monitoring includes renal function (serum creatinine 0.7\u20131.3 mg/dL) monthly during antiviral therapy. Imaging follow-up not routinely indicated unless neurological deficits evolve. Long-term complications occur in 10\u201315% of treated patients, including motor neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction. One-year prognosis: 80% complete resolution; five-year follow-up studies show <5% residual pain. Rehabilitation: start desensitization exercises at one month; full function generally by six months. Patient education emphasizes completing full antiviral course, skin care to prevent secondary infection, and lifestyle modifications to support immune function. Driving and work may resume once acute rash is crusted and pain controlled \u22643/10. Recommend support groups (National Herpes Zoster Association) and online resources for chronic pain management.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early initiation: Antiviral therapy within 72 hours reduces PHN risk by 50\u201360%. 2. Dose and duration: Acyclovir 800 mg five times daily for seven days or valacyclovir 1000 mg TID. 3. Age risk: Patients over 60 have a threefold higher incidence of PHN than younger adults. 4. Sensory exam: Allodynia and hyperalgesia in a dermatomal distribution are hallmark findings. 5.

Option B (ACA) and Option C (PCA) are less commonly involved because their perforators are less enveloped by basal exudates.

The described retinal findings of orange-colored vessels and retinal hemorrhages ('red spots') together constitute 'malarial retinopathy,' a well-recognized feature of cerebral malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum.

Historically, ocular findings in malaria were first documented in the 19th century and later systematically characterized in the 1990s, establishing their prognostic value.","pathophysiology":"Normal retinal vessels exhibit red reflex without discoloration. In P. falciparum infection, parasitized erythrocytes adhere to endothelium via PfEMP1 interactions with ICAM-1 and EPCR, causing microvascular occlusion, ischemia, and breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier.
