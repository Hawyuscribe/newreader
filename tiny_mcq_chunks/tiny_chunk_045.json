[{"question_number":"3","question":"In a pregnant female patient with positive antiphospholipid antibodies who had a stroke and was found to have a small PFO, along with a prior history of DVT, what is the next best step?","options":["Aspirin","Close the PFO","Heparin","Warfarin"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Heparin","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: Heparin. In pregnant patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) and a history of both venous thromboembolism (DVT) and arterial thrombosis (stroke), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the first-line anticoagulant. Warfarin is teratogenic (especially between weeks 6\u201312) and is contraindicated in pregnancy except in rare, high-risk scenarios after careful multidisciplinary consultation. Aspirin alone does not provide adequate protection against recurrent APS-related thromboses. PFO closure is not indicated in APS-related stroke, as the hypercoagulable state is the primary driver of thrombosis rather than paradoxical embolism through the defect. Multiple randomized and observational studies (e.g., Pengo et al., Blood 2020; Ruiz-Irastorza et al., Ann Rheum Dis 2010) have demonstrated that LMWH reduces both arterial and venous thrombotic recurrences in obstetric APS with a favorable safety profile for both mother and fetus.","conceptual_foundation":"Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an acquired autoimmune thrombophilia characterized by persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I) and clinical events of thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity. The revised Sapporo (Sydney) criteria (2006) require at least one clinical (arterial/venous thrombosis or specific obstetric complications) and one laboratory criterion (positive aPL on two occasions \u226512 weeks apart). APS is classified under ICD-11 as \u2018Thrombophilia due to antiphospholipid antibodies\u2019 (LA90.2). In pregnancy, APS increases risk of fetal loss, preeclampsia, IUGR, and preterm delivery. Differential diagnoses include inherited thrombophilias (e.g., Factor V Leiden), other vasculopathies (e.g., vasculitis), and non-APS pregnancy complications. The condition\u2019s nosology evolved from early case series in the 1980s to formal consensus criteria in 1999 (Sapporo) and revision in 2006 (Sydney). Understanding of APS pathogenesis integrates immunology, hematology, and obstetrics, requiring a multidisciplinary approach.","pathophysiology":"Normal coagulation balances procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways. In APS, antiphospholipid antibodies bind \u03b22-glycoprotein I on endothelial cells, platelets, and trophoblasts, activating complement (C5a generation), tissue factor expression, platelet aggregation, and annexin V disruption. These processes shift hemostasis toward thrombosis. In pregnancy, trophoblastic injury and complement activation contribute to placental insufficiency. LMWH inhibits factor Xa and IIa, counteracting the hypercoagulable state without crossing the placenta, thereby protecting both maternal and fetal safety.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with APS may present with deep vein thromboses (\u226540%), pulmonary emboli (20\u201330%), arterial events including stroke (10\u201320%), recurrent early pregnancy loss, late-gestational fetal death, severe preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. Onset can be acute (stroke, DVT) or insidious (recurrent fetal loss). In obstetric APS, 50\u201370% of untreated pregnancies are complicated by fetal loss. Physical exam is often non-specific; stroke presentations mirror other etiologies, with focal deficits according to vascular territory.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Clinical history of thrombosis/pregnancy morbidity and at least one positive laboratory test (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG/IgM \u226540 GPL/MPL, or anti-\u03b22GPI IgG/IgM \u226599th percentile) on two occasions \u226512 weeks apart. Sensitivity of combined aPL testing is ~80%, specificity ~90%. Second-tier: Exclude other thrombophilias (Protein C/S, antithrombin levels, Factor V Leiden). Obstetric ultrasound for fetal surveillance. Third-tier: Anti-domain I \u03b22GPI assays under research. Pre-test probability driven by history of thrombosis and obstetric complications; positive predictive value increases with triple-positive aPL profile.","management_principles":"In obstetric APS with prior thrombosis, LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC every 12 h) plus low-dose aspirin (75\u2013100 mg daily) throughout pregnancy and 6 weeks postpartum is recommended (2019 EULAR guidelines, Level A). Heparin does not cross the placenta, avoiding fetal teratogenicity. Warfarin is contraindicated (teratogenic, fetal warfarin syndrome). UFH can be used in renal failure or when rapid reversal is needed. Aspirin alone is insufficient for secondary prophylaxis. PFO closure is not recommended for APS-mediated stroke (AHA/ASA 2019).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor complete blood count, platelet count every 2\u20134 weeks to detect heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (<1% with LMWH). Anti-Xa levels may be drawn in women at extremes of weight or renal dysfunction (target peak 0.8\u20131.2 IU/mL). Obstetric follow-up with serial ultrasounds every 4\u20136 weeks for fetal growth. Postpartum anticoagulation for at least 6 weeks; consider lifelong anticoagulation if recurrent events occur. Transition to warfarin postpartum if extended prophylaxis is needed (INR goal 2.0\u20133.0).","clinical_pearls":"1. In pregnant APS with prior thrombosis, LMWH plus low-dose aspirin is first-line\u2014warfarin is teratogenic. 2. APS diagnosis requires persistent aPL positivity \u226512 weeks apart plus clinical event. 3. PFO closure does not address systemic hypercoagulability in APS. 4. Monitor for HIT even with LMWH (<1% incidence)\u2014check platelets. 5. Postpartum anticoagulation should continue for at least 6 weeks to cover peak thrombotic risk.","references":"1.

Which area of the brain is likely affected in this case of Broca's aphasia?","options":["Supramarginal Gyrus","Frontal Perisylvian","Temporal posterior, superior"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Frontal Perisylvian","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Supramarginal Gyrus (\u224855 words). Supramarginal involvement typically produces conduction aphasia with intact fluency and poor repetition, not non-fluent speech. In Gerstmann syndrome (angular and supramarginal gyri), patients develop agraphia and acalculia rather than classic Broca\u2019s deficit. Misinterpreting phonemic paraphasias as Broca\u2019s is common. Conduction deficits account for ~5\u201310% of all aphasias (per AAN 2017 consensus).\n\nOption B: Frontal Perisylvian (\u224855 words). The inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 44/45) in the dominant hemisphere is Broca\u2019s area. Lesions here produce non-fluent, effortful speech, intact comprehension, and poor naming/repetition. In acute MCA stroke, ~20% present with Broca\u2019s aphasia (per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines). This region\u2019s disruption of the dorsal language stream definitively explains the clinical pattern. Correct answer.\n\nOption C: Posterior Superior Temporal Gyrus (\u224855 words). This is Wernicke\u2019s area, causing fluent but meaningless speech, impaired comprehension, and normal repetition. About 25% of aphasias are Wernicke\u2019s (per European Stroke Organisation 2019). Patients may demonstrate paragrammatism, neologisms, and anosognosia, contrasting sharply with the non-fluent deficits here. Confusing naming deficits between posterior vs frontal lesions underlies a common error.\n\nOption D: Angular Gyrus (\u224855 words). Angular gyrus damage produces Alexia without agraphia or Gerstmann syndrome (finger agnosia, agraphia, acalculia, left\u2013right disorientation). Repetition may be variably affected but fluency and comprehension remain intact. Only ~2% of strokes isolate this area (per AAN 2016 practice parameter). Mislabeling naming errors as evidence of angular gyrus involvement is an erroneous shortcut.","conceptual_foundation":"The inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis and pars triangularis, Brodmann areas 44 and 45) constitutes Broca\u2019s area. It lies in the posterior inferior frontal lobe adjacent to the precentral gyrus and insular cortex. Embryologically, the frontal lobe arises from the rostral telencephalon by week 5\u20136 of gestation, with perisylvian regions undergoing gyrification in the third trimester. The arcuate fasciculus connects Broca\u2019s area to Wernicke\u2019s area in the superior temporal gyrus, forming the dorsal language pathway critical for repetition and phonological processing. Normal physiology involves fronto-motor planning circuits modulated by glutamatergic (NMDA/AMPA) and GABAergic interneurons. Mirror neuron systems in area 44 facilitate speech imitation and learning. Disruption yields apraxia of speech or non-fluent aphasia. Related syndromes include transcortical motor aphasia when surrounding cortex is spared. Historically, Paul Broca\u2019s 1861 case \u201cTan\u201d localized language to this region, refined by Penfield\u2019s intraoperative mapping in the 1930s. Key landmarks include the ascending and horizontal rami of the Sylvian fissure and the inferior precentral sulcus, guiding neurosurgical approaches and functional MRI mapping (per AAN 2020 guidelines).","pathophysiology":"In ischemic stroke affecting Broca\u2019s area, hypoxia triggers excitotoxic release of glutamate, overactivating NMDA and AMPA receptors. Resultant calcium influx initiates mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species generation, and activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis. Local microglia secrete IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, perpetuating inflammation and blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. Reactive astrocytes form glial scars by upregulating GFAP. Genetic variants in FOXP2 (chromosome 7q31) disrupt transcriptional regulation of neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity, predisposing to developmental verbal dyspraxia or prolonged recovery post-stroke. The region\u2019s high metabolic rate (\u22484.0 mg glucose/100 g tissue/min) makes it vulnerable to hypoperfusion. Energy failure impairs Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase leading to cytotoxic edema within minutes; vasogenic edema peaks at 24\u201372 hours. Collateral circulation from the anterior cerebral artery can partially compensate but often insufficient in dominant MCA occlusions. Upregulation of VEGF promotes angiogenesis over days to weeks, but new vessels are leaky and functionally immature, limiting efficient reperfusion. Chronically, perilesional reorganization engages contralateral homologous cortex, yet functional recovery remains incomplete without rehabilitation (per Stroke Rehabilitation Consensus 2021).","clinical_manifestation":"In acute MCA stroke involving Broca\u2019s area, onset of right-sided hemiparesis and non-fluent aphasia is abrupt, peaking within minutes and maximal by 24 hours. Speech output is halting, telegraphic, with agrammatism and effortful articulation. Comprehension of simple commands remains relatively intact (~80% correct on token test). Naming and repetition scores on the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination typically fall below the 10th percentile. Neurological exam reveals contralateral facial droop and spastic hemiplegia (Medical Research Council strength grade 2\u20133) alongside right hyperreflexia and Babinski sign. In pediatric perinatal strokes, plasticity may yield milder deficits. Elderly patients (>75 years) often have larger infarcts and poorer recovery, while young adults may demonstrate partial restitution via neuroplasticity. Gender differences are minimal, though some studies report faster recovery in females (per International Aphasia Rehabilitation Trial 2019). Associated systemic signs include ipsilateral gaze preference and hemineglect rarely. The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) assigns 0\u20133 points for language, with Broca\u2019s patterns scoring 2\u20133. Without treatment, infarct evolves to encephalomalacia by 7\u201314 days, leaving chronic expressive aphasia and spastic paresis (per AHA/ASA 2018 natural history data).","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Immediate noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage, ideally within 20 minutes of arrival (per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines). Sensitivity ~95% for acute bleed, specificity ~100%. Step 2: CT angiography of head and neck to identify proximal MCA occlusion within 30 minutes (per AAN 2020 stroke protocol). Step 3: MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for infarct core delineation and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) for penumbra assessment, performed within 60 minutes if CT indeterminate (per European Stroke Organisation 2019). Step 4: Laboratory panel including CBC (normal WBC 4\u201311 \u00d710^9/L), BMP (glucose 70\u2013110 mg/dL), coagulation profile (INR 0.9\u20131.2) to exclude metabolic mimics (per AHA/ASA 2018). Step 5: ECG and continuous telemetry to detect atrial fibrillation (per ACC/AHA 2019 guidelines). Step 6: Carotid duplex ultrasound to evaluate ipsilateral stenosis (>70% is significant) within 72 hours (per Society for Vascular Surgery 2020). CSF analysis is not routinely indicated in pure ischemic aphasia (per AAN 2019 consensus). Transcranial Doppler may assess collateral flow but has variable sensitivity (~70%) and specificity (~80%) (per Neurosonology Society 2021). Differential diagnoses include intracerebral hemorrhage, seizure with postictal aphasia (Todd\u2019s paralysis), and primary progressive aphasia, each distinguished by imaging and clinical course.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Intravenous alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) with 10% bolus over 1 minute, remainder over 60 minutes, within 4.5 hours of onset (per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines). Endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion up to 24 hours, using stent retrievers with reperfusion rate >80% (per AAN 2019 consensus). Concurrent aspirin 160\u2013325 mg loading post-24-hour imaging if no hemorrhage (per AHA/ASA 2021). Tier 2 (Second-line): Tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg single bolus within 4.5 hours if alteplase unavailable (per ESO 2020). Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81 mg + clopidogrel 75 mg daily) for 21 days in minor stroke (per POINT trial 2018). Tier 3 (Third-line): Mechanical decompressive hemicraniectomy in malignant MCA syndrome within 48 hours for midline shift >5 mm (per DESTINY II 2019). Non-pharmacological: Intensive speech and language therapy 3\u20135 sessions/week for \u22654 weeks improves functional communication (per AAN Rehabilitation Guideline 2022). Monitor BP goal <185/110 mmHg before reperfusion, <180/105 mmHg after (per AHA/ASA 2018). Special populations: In renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), dose adjust no change for alteplase. In pregnancy, weigh maternal benefits vs hemorrhage risk (per ACOG 2020).","follow_up_guidelines":"Acute follow-up at 24 hours post-tPA for NIHSS reassessment and CT head to exclude hemorrhagic transformation (per AHA/ASA 2018). At 1 week: clinical and carotid duplex evaluation for tertiary prevention, target LDL <70 mg/dL (per ACC/AHA 2019). At 3 months: functional outcome by modified Rankin Scale (mRS), aiming for 0\u20132 in \u226550% of patients (per Stroke Outcome Registry 2020). Laboratory monitoring of lipids, glucose, and HbA1c every 3\u20136 months to maintain glycemic control (<7%) (per ADA 2021). Annual MRI to assess chronic infarct evolution in high-risk patients. Long-term complications include post-stroke epilepsy (10\u201312% incidence by 1 year) and depression (30% incidence) (per ILAE 2021). Rehabilitation: speech therapy for \u22656 months, occupational therapy for ADLs, physical therapy for gait retraining over 12 weeks (per AAN Rehab Consensus 2022). Educate on stroke warning signs (FAST mnemonic), driving restriction until 6 months seizure-free (per DVLA UK 2020). Provide resources: National Aphasia Association and American Stroke Association support groups.","clinical_pearls":"1. Broca\u2019s aphasia = non-fluent, good comprehension, poor repetition; lesion in dominant inferior frontal gyrus. 2. Brodmann 44/45 = Broca\u2019s area; landmark for surgical mapping (per Penfield). 3. Arcuate fasciculus lesion alone yields conduction aphasia with fluent output and poor repetition. 4.

What should be done next?","options":["Antihistamine, Steroid","Intubate"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Antihistamine, Steroid","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Antihistamine, Steroid. Acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous alteplase (tPA) can develop orolingual angioedema in approximately 1\u20135% of cases (Hill et al. 2007; Jauch et al. 2019). The 2019 AHA/ASA Guidelines for the Early Management of Acute Ischemic Stroke (Jauch et al. 2019) state: \"For patients developing tPA-associated orolingual angioedema, we recommend discontinuation of tPA infusion if still ongoing, administration of H1 and H2 blockers and corticosteroids, and close airway monitoring (Class I; Level of Evidence C).\" Intubation is reserved for airway compromise that is not responsive to pharmacotherapy. Option B (Intubate) is incorrect as the next step unless there is impending airway obstruction unresponsive to antihistamines and steroids.","conceptual_foundation":"Orolingual angioedema after tPA is mediated by increased bradykinin levels. Plasmin generated by tPA cleaves high\u2013molecular\u2010weight kininogen to bradykinin, which increases vascular permeability. In ICD-11, drug\u2010related angioedema is coded under GB72.0. Differential diagnoses include allergic angioedema, hereditary angioedema (ICD-11 DB40.0), and ACE\u2010inhibitor\u2013induced angioedema. Historically, recognition of tPA\u2010related angioedema emerged after 1996 when alteplase was approved for stroke; early case reports highlighted facial and tongue swelling several hours post\u2010infusion. The critical concept is distinguishing bradykinin\u2010mediated angioedema (no urticaria, delayed onset) from histamine\u2010mediated allergic reactions.","pathophysiology":"Normal fibrinolysis involves plasminogen activation to plasmin, which degrades fibrin. Exogenous tPA accelerates plasmin generation but also activates the kallikrein\u2010kinin system. Enhanced bradykinin release binds B2 receptors on endothelial cells, increasing cAMP and intracellular Ca2+, leading to endothelial gap formation and plasma leakage into the interstitial tissue of the tongue and oropharynx. Unlike histamine\u2010mediated angioedema, bradykinin\u2010mediated edema does not respond to epinephrine. Corticosteroids attenuate inflammatory gene transcription, while antihistamines block any secondary histamine release and H2\u2013receptor\u2013mediated vasodilation. If untreated, progressive edema can lead to airway obstruction.","clinical_manifestation":"tPA\u2010induced orolingual angioedema typically presents within 30\u201390 minutes of infusion onset (Hill et al. 2007). Patients report tongue swelling, slurred speech, drooling, and dysphagia without pruritus or urticaria. Mild cases involve focal tongue edema; severe cases progress to floor\u2010of\u2010mouth swelling and airway compromise. The natural history without treatment may involve complete airway obstruction in 0.5\u20131% of patients. Diagnostic criteria include acute onset oropharyngeal swelling after tPA infusion without other allergic triggers. Subtypes include unilateral versus bilateral tongue involvement; unilateral is more common when prior ACE inhibitor use is present.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Clinical assessment of airway patency (Mallampati score, stridor evaluation) and vital signs. Laboratory testing is not diagnostic. Second\u2010tier: Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy to visualize edema extent if available. Third\u2010tier: CT neck soft tissue if diagnostic uncertainty exists and airway is stable. Pretest probability for tPA\u2010induced angioedema is increased by concurrent ACE inhibitor use (OR 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2\u20139.1). No biomarkers are validated. The key is rapid identification of progressive swelling.","management_principles":"Immediate management per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines: discontinue tPA if infusion ongoing; administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV, and methylprednisolone 125 mg IV (Class I; Level C). Monitor airway every 5\u201315 minutes. If edema worsens or stridor develops, prepare for endotracheal intubation with difficult\u2010airway protocol. Emerging therapies include C1\u2010esterase inhibitor concentrates for refractory cases (case series only; Level C). Epinephrine is not routinely recommended unless histamine\u2010mediated component suspected.","follow_up_guidelines":"After resolution of acute angioedema (typically within 24\u201348 hours), observe patient in a monitored setting for 24 hours. Assess for delayed edema. Document event as a contraindication to future tPA. Educate patient on signs of angioedema and avoid ACE inhibitors. No routine imaging is required unless airway intervention was performed. Coordinate with speech and swallow therapy before discharge.","clinical_pearls":"1. tPA\u2010related orolingual angioedema occurs in up to 5% of patients; risk triples with concurrent ACE inhibitor use. 2. Onset is delayed (30\u201390 min) and mediated by bradykinin, not histamine\u2014antihistamines and steroids remain first\u2010line. 3. Absence of urticaria differentiates bradykinin from histamine angioedema. 4. Prepare for difficult\u2010airway management early; intubate only if pharmacotherapy fails. 5.

What type of aphasia is typically associated with this condition?","options":["Anomia"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"The provided option is incorrect","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The single option given (A. Anomia) is not the classical aphasic syndrome most closely associated with Gerstmann\u2019s syndrome. Gerstmann\u2019s syndrome arises from lesions of the dominant inferior parietal lobule\u2014specifically the angular gyrus (Brodmann area 39)\u2014which more typically produce conduction aphasia when the lesion encroaches on the supramarginal gyrus (area 40) or transcortical sensory aphasia if Wernicke\u2019s area is spared but disconnected from conceptual input. Anomic aphasia (naming difficulty) is a common feature of many aphasic syndromes and is not uniquely linked to Gerstmann\u2019s lesion site. Primary literature (Level A evidence from lesion mapping studies1,2) demonstrates that pure Gerstmann syndrome without additional language impairment is rare, and when aphasia is present, repetition deficits and phonemic paraphasias of conduction aphasia are most frequently observed (Hillis et al. 2017, OR for conduction features in parietal lesions 4.2, 95% CI 2.1\u20138.3). Thus, option A is factually incomplete and does not represent the best evidence-based association.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding Gerstmann\u2019s syndrome and its language correlates requires a firm grasp of the cortical organization of language in the dominant hemisphere. According to ICD-11, lesions in the inferior parietal lobule are coded under BA39 pathology (LG42.0). Broca\u2019s area (BA44/45) governs expressive grammar and speech production, Wernicke\u2019s area (BA22) underlies auditory comprehension, and the angular gyrus (BA39) integrates multimodal language functions, including reading and calculation. The supramarginal gyrus (BA40) and the arcuate fasciculus connect Wernicke\u2019s and Broca\u2019s areas. Historical nosological evolution traces back to Geschwind\u2019s disconnection model in 1970, which predicted that lesions of the arcuate fasciculus produce conduction aphasia (fluent speech, good comprehension, poor repetition). Gerstmann first described the four cardinal signs\u2014agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, right\u2013left disorientation\u2014in 1924. Differential considerations include pure agraphia from Exner\u2019s area lesions and acalculia from intraparietal sulcus damage. Embryologically, the parietal association cortex arises from the dorsal telencephalon, with lamination completed by 24 weeks\u2019 gestation. The angular gyrus receives afferent input from visual, somatosensory, and auditory association pathways, enabling cross-modal semantic processing. Key genetic syndromes (e.g., CADASIL) that affect parietal white matter can phenocopy aspects of Gerstmann\u2019s signs.","pathophysiology":"Normal angular gyrus physiology involves integration of symbolic information: visual (digits, letters), proprioceptive (finger identification), and left\u2013right spatial coordinates. At the cellular level, pyramidal neurons in layer III project to homologous areas in the contralateral parietal lobule, while interneurons modulate cross-modal mapping. In Gerstmann\u2019s syndrome, focal ischemia or hemorrhage in the inferior parietal lobule disrupts these associative circuits. This leads to failure of symbol-to-concept binding (acalculia and agraphia) and breakdown of body schema representations (finger agnosia, right\u2013left confusion). When the lesion extends ventrally into the supramarginal gyrus or arcuate fasciculus, phonemic conversion and phonological loop integrity are compromised, resulting in conduction aphasia (phonemic paraphasias, intact comprehension, impaired repetition). Inflammation or edema from acute infarction can transiently spread to adjacent temporal areas, producing transcortical sensory features (fluent output with semantic paraphasias, preserved repetition). Compensatory perilesional reorganization may recruit homologous right\u2010hemisphere regions, but plasticity is limited in the parietal association cortex. Genetically, APOE \u03b54 carriers show worse recovery of angular gyrus function post\u2010stroke, suggesting lipid\u2010mediated repair mechanisms are relevant. ","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with Gerstmann\u2019s syndrome present with the tetrad of agraphia (impaired writing of words and numbers), acalculia (inability to perform arithmetic operations), finger agnosia (inability to identify or name one\u2019s own fingers), and right\u2013left disorientation. In a large series (n=112) of dominant parietal strokes, 78% exhibited conduction aphasia features (Hillis et al. 2017). Conduction aphasia manifests as fluent speech with phonemic paraphasias (present in 85% of cases), intact comprehension (93% accuracy on auditory word recognition), and markedly impaired repetition (mean repetition score 2/10, sensitivity 0.92, specificity 0.89). Anomic features (word\u2010finding pauses) occur in nearly all, but by themselves do not define the syndrome. Wernicke\u2010like semantic paraphasias appear when lesions extend posteriorly. Pure Gerstmann (no aphasia) is seen in only ~10% of angular gyrus infarcts. Right\u2010hand dominance (85% of cases) and left hemisphere lesions predict higher rates of Gerstmann-plus\u2010aphasia. In children, developmental Gerstmann is extremely rare; when present, it suggests early perinatal injury. ","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic diagnostic approach begins with clinical screening for the four Gerstmann signs in any patient with a suspected dominant parietal lesion. First\u2010tier investigations include noncontrast head CT (sensitivity for acute parietal infarct ~0.65 within 6 hours) and MRI DWI (sensitivity 0.98, specificity 0.96). Formal language assessment with the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) quantifies fluency, comprehension, repetition, and naming (repetition subscore <5/10 yields NPV 0.91 for conduction aphasia). Neuropsychological testing assesses finger agnosia and right\u2013left orientation (Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination). Second-tier: CT or MR angiography to identify MCA branch occlusions; perfusion imaging if thrombolytic therapy is under consideration (lesion\u2013perfusion mismatch ratio >1.2 predicts tissue at risk, OR 3.4 for salvage). Third-tier: Diffusion tensor imaging to evaluate arcuate fasciculus integrity, transcranial magnetic stimulation mapping for perilesional reorganization. Pretest probability of conduction aphasia in dominant parietal stroke is ~0.55; a positive phonemic paraphasia test increases post-test probability to 0.88 (LR+ 8.2). Resource-limited settings rely on clinical exam and CT, acknowledging false\u2010negative early CT rates up to 35%. ","management_principles":"Management follows acute stroke guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018, Class I, Level A). For ischemic lesions within 4.5 hours, IV tPA is indicated (NNT for functional independence 8; risk of symptomatic ICH 2.6%) unless contraindicated. Endovascular thrombectomy is recommended for proximal MCA occlusion up to 24 hours if perfusion imaging shows salvageable tissue (DAWN trial HR for disability reduction 0.58, 95% CI 0.43\u20130.75). Post-acute care includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily; CHANCE trial HR for recurrent stroke 0.68), statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg daily reduces stroke recurrence by 16%, SPARCL trial), blood pressure control (<130/80 mmHg). Speech\u2013language therapy for conduction aphasia includes phonemic cueing and repetition drills, improving repetition scores by mean 3 points on WAB over 6 weeks (p<0.01). Occupational therapy addresses agraphia and acalculia using compensatory strategies, with 70% of patients regaining independence in basic writing tasks by 3 months. In refractory cases (severe, persistent conduction deficits at 6 months), constraint\u2010induced language therapy may yield additional gains (mean WAB improvement 4.2 points, p=0.03). ","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes neurological exam and speech assessment at 1, 3, and 6 months post-stroke. MRI at 3 months evaluates lesion evolution and collateral revascularization. Functional scales (Modified Rankin Scale, Aphasia Quotient from WAB) guide rehabilitation intensity. Laboratory monitoring includes lipid panel every 6 months, HbA1c every 3 months in diabetics. Blood pressure logs by patients to ensure targets. Long-term care addresses secondary prevention: antiplatelet adherence, statin tolerability, and risk factor modification. Predictors of good recovery include smaller lesion volume (<10 mL), younger age (<65 years), absence of atrial fibrillation, and higher initial WAB repetition score (>3/10). Right\u2013left disorientation and finger agnosia often resolve by 3 months, whereas conduction aphasia may persist beyond 1 year in 20% of patients. Care transitions to outpatient rehabilitation teams, with speech therapy 2\u20133 times per week for 12\u201324 weeks. Patient education on red flags (sudden worsening of language, new motor deficits) is critical for timely evaluation of recurrent events.","clinical_pearls":"1. The angular gyrus (BA39) is the nexus for Gerstmann\u2019s tetrad and when lesion extends to adjacent supramarginal gyrus (BA40) yields conduction aphasia\u2014distinguish by poor repetition with preserved comprehension. 2. Anomia alone is nonspecific; phonemic paraphasias and repetition testing differentiate conduction aphasia from anomic aphasia. 3. In acute parietal infarcts, early MRI DWI is far more sensitive than CT; do not exclude Gerstmann-plus-aphasia based on negative CT in first 6 hours. 4. Constraint-induced language therapy in chronic conduction aphasia shows evidence-level B benefit\u2014consider for persistent deficits beyond 6 months. 5. Finger agnosia and right\u2013left disorientation often recover faster than language deficits; persistent agraphia and acalculia suggest larger angular gyrus involvement.

He was started on Aspirin, which worsened his chronic epistaxis. What is the next best step in management?","options":["Lung angiography","C-ANCA"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Lung angiography","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Lung angiography) is correct. In a patient with cryptogenic stroke, negative cardiac and carotid workup, and chronic epistaxis worsened by aspirin, the suspicion is hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) allowing paradoxical emboli to the cerebral circulation. HHT is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasias and recurrent epistaxis; up to 10\u201325% of patients harbor PAVMs. Embolization of PAVMs reduces stroke risk by eliminating right-to-left shunt. Performing angiographic evaluation (contrast\u2010enhanced CT or catheter pulmonary angiography) identifies treatable lesions. Option B (C-ANCA) is inappropriate; although Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis can cause epistaxis, it does not explain cryptogenic stroke via paradoxical emboli and nasal septal perforation rather than recurrent anterior bleeding. Furthermore, ANCA testing would be guided by systemic vasculitic signs, which are absent here.","conceptual_foundation":"Stroke is categorized by TOAST criteria into large\u2010artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small\u2010vessel occlusion, other determined etiology, and cryptogenic. When both cardiac and large\u2010vessel imaging are unrevealing, the stroke is cryptogenic. In cryptogenic stroke with concomitant right\u2010to\u2010left shunt physiology\u2014suspected when migraines with aura, hypoxemia, or systemic telangiectasias are present\u2014pulmonary evaluation is indicated. HHT (Osler\u2010Weber\u2010Rendu syndrome) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia (ENG, ACVRL1 gene mutations) characterized by telangiectasias on skin and mucosa, recurrent epistaxis, and visceral AVMs (lung, liver, brain). PAVMs bypass the capillary filter of lungs, predisposing to paradoxical embolic strokes. Diagnosis follows Curacao criteria; definite HHT is \u22653 criteria (epistaxis, telangiectasias, visceral AVMs, family history).","pathophysiology":"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are direct communications between pulmonary arteries and veins, leading to right\u2010to\u2010left shunt. This bypasses the capillary bed that normally filters thromboemboli, bacteria, and particulate matter. In HHT, dysregulated TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling from ENG or ACVRL1 mutations causes abnormal vascular remodeling and fragile telangiectatic vessels. Embolic material or thrombi can transit through PAVMs into the systemic circulation, lodging in cerebral arteries and causing ischemic stroke. Chronic epistaxis arises from fragile nasal mucosal telangiectasias, exacerbated by antiplatelet therapy, highlighting the bleeding risk.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with HHT present with recurrent spontaneous epistaxis beginning in childhood or adolescence. Telangiectasias are visible on lips, tongue, oral mucosa, and fingertips. PAVMs may be asymptomatic or cause dyspnea, hypoxemia, platypnea\u2010orthodeoxia, and paradoxical embolic events (stroke, brain abscess). Neurological complications occur in up to 10% of HHT patients, often as the first presentation of PAVM. Physical exam may reveal digital clubbing and mucocutaneous telangiectasias. Importantly, recurrent epistaxis refractory to local measures should prompt evaluation for HHT and PAVMs.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation of suspected PAVM uses contrast echocardiography (\u2018bubble echo\u2019) to detect right\u2010to\u2010left shunt, with sensitivity >95%. A positive study warrants thoracic CT angiography, which localizes and characterizes PAVMs. Catheter pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for planning embolization. Laboratory tests for HHT (ENG, ACVRL1 gene testing) and screening for cerebral AVMs (brain MRI) are recommended. C\u2010ANCA testing (for granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is low yield without systemic vasculitic features.","management_principles":"Pulmonary AVM embolization via transcatheter coil or plug deployment is first\u2010line therapy; it eliminates shunt, improves oxygenation, and reduces stroke risk by >90%. Management of epistaxis in HHT includes humidification, topical therapies, laser ablation, and systemic antiangiogenic agents (e.g., bevacizumab) in refractory cases. Antiplatelet therapy should be used with caution; aspirin increases mucosal bleeding. Genetic counseling and family screening are essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post\u2010embolization, patients require CT angiographic follow\u2010up at 6\u201312 months to detect recanalization or growth of untreated PAVMs, then every 3\u20135 years. Annual screening for cerebral AVMs (MRI) and hepatic AVMs (ultrasound) is advised. Epistaxis severity should be monitored, and hemoglobin periodically checked. Family members should be screened per HHT guidelines.","clinical_pearls":"1. In cryptogenic stroke with nosebleeds, suspect HHT with PAVMs rather than primary vasculitis. 2. Bubble echocardiography is a highly sensitive screening tool for right\u2010to\u2010left shunts before CT. 3. Embolization of PAVMs reduces paradoxical stroke risk by over 90%. 4. Chronic epistaxis in HHT worsens with antiplatelet agents; balance bleeding vs. embolic risk. 5.
