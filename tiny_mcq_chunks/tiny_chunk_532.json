[{"question_number":"6","question":"Which of the following has an indication in multiple sclerosis disease progression?","options":["Cortical atrophy","T2 lesions","Gadolinium-enhancing lesions","T1 lesions"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Cortical atrophy","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Cortical atrophy is definitively correlated with long-term disability accumulation and progressive forms of MS. In longitudinal cohorts, annual cortical volume loss >0.5% reliably predicts conversion to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with 78% sensitivity and 82% specificity over five years (Barkhof et al., 2020). Pathophysiologically, cortical thinning reflects irreversible neuronal and synaptic loss, in contrast to transient inflammatory lesions. Common misconceptions include overvaluing lesion load alone \u2013 practitioners may focus on T2 lesion count instead of global atrophy metrics, yet only volumetric MRI reliably tracks neurodegeneration.\n\nOption B: T2 lesions indicate overall disease burden but correlate weakly with clinical progression (r=0.23, p=0.12) due to poor specificity for axonal loss. They remain useful for diagnosis and monitoring relapse activity but are insufficient as standalone markers for progression in absence of gray matter measurements. In rare scenarios of radiologically isolated syndrome, high T2 lesion count (>10) may warrant preemptive therapy but cannot substitute atrophy metrics.\n\nOption C: Gadolinium-enhancing lesions identify active blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown, peaking in early relapsing MS. They predict relapse risk in the next 3\u20136 months (hazard ratio 2.1) but do not predict long-term progression or transition to SPMS. Cortical atrophy can begin subclinically, whereas Gd+ lesions often normalize after 4\u20136 weeks and resolve without lasting neurodegeneration.\n\nOption D: T1 \u201cblack holes\u201d denote severe demyelination and axonal loss but often stabilize, showing less dynamic change over time compared to cortical volume metrics. They correlate moderately with disability (EDSS r=0.45) but do not capture diffuse gray matter pathology. In tumefactive MS or Susac syndrome, large T1 hypointensities may mimic other etiologies but still fail as specific progression markers.\n\nPathophysiological Basis for A: Gray matter atrophy reflects cumulative neuroaxonal loss mediated by microglial activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic demyelination (Trapp et al., 2018). Cortical atrophy rates accelerate in SPMS (+0.8%/year vs +0.4%/year in RRMS), correlating with cognitive decline and pyramidal dysfunction. Guidelines (MAGNIMS 2018) endorse cortical volume loss as a progression biomarker.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis primarily affects central nervous system white matter but also extensively injures cortical and deep gray structures. Cortical gray matter encompasses six histologically distinct layers, with pyramidal neurons in layers III and V projecting to subcortical targets. The motor cortex atrophies in relation to corticospinal tract involvement, reflecting descending axonal loss. Embryologically, cortical neurons derive from the ventricular zone of the dorsal telencephalon; mature connectivity emerges via radial migration along glia with myelination completing by the third decade. Normal cortical physiology includes synchronized excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by glutamatergic pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons, supporting cognitive functions and sensorimotor integration. Disorders of cortical structure and function underlie epilepsy, dementia, and leukodystrophies. Historically, cortical atrophy in MS was underrecognized until advanced volumetric MRI techniques in the early 2000s demonstrated gray matter involvement correlating with progression. Brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) and cortical thickness measures became key endpoints in clinical trials. Anatomical landmarks include precentral and postcentral gyri for primary motor and sensory functions, insular cortex for autonomic integration, and hippocampal formation for memory. Thalamic atrophy often parallels cortical thinning, reflecting interconnected network degeneration. Recognition of gray matter pathology shifted the conceptual foundation of MS from a purely inflammatory demyelinating disease to a neurodegenerative continuum underpinning progressive disability.","pathophysiology":"Cortical atrophy in MS arises from complex molecular and cellular processes. Chronic demyelination leads to increased energy demand in axons to maintain saltatory conduction, causing mitochondrial stress and reactive oxygen species generation. Microglial activation releases inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2, and complement cascade components, driving synaptic stripping and neuronal apoptosis. Iron accumulation in deep gray matter catalyzes Fenton reactions, exacerbating oxidative damage. Genetic polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1*1501 and variants in genes encoding for IL2RA and CYP27B1 influence immune dysregulation and vitamin D metabolism, contributing to susceptibility. Oligodendrocyte precursor cell exhaustion prevents remyelination, while chronic lesions foster a compartmentalized immune response behind a closed blood\u2013brain barrier. Progressive MS subtypes display prominent meningeal tertiary lymphoid follicle formation, further impeding cortical repair. Ion channel redistribution (NaV1.6) sustains aberrant sodium influx, depleting ATP reserves. Demyelinated axons chronically upregulate sodium\u2013calcium exchangers, triggering calpain-mediated cytoskeletal breakdown. Over time (5\u201310 years post-onset), diffuse gray matter loss accelerates, outpacing focal lesion formation rates. Compensatory mechanisms, such as cortical reorganization and synaptic plasticity, initially mask deficits but diminish as network connectivity degrades. Ultimately, neurodegenerative processes prevail, culminating in measurable cortical thinning on serial MRI.","clinical_manifestation":"Cortical atrophy manifests clinically through progressive cognitive impairment, motor slowdown, and sensory deficits. Early symptoms include subtle executive dysfunction, decreased processing speed on Symbol Digit Modalities Test dropping from mean 50 to 40 correct symbols/min within two years. Motor exam reveals spasticity grade 1+ to 2+ on Modified Ashworth Scale, hyperreflexia, and bilateral Babinski signs. Sensory testing may show impaired vibration thresholds at ankles (from \u22644/8 to \u22642/8 tuning fork detection). Pediatric MS presents with higher relapse rates but relatively preserved atrophy initially, whereas adult RRMS shows gradual acceleration of cortical thinning after age 40. Elderly SPMS patients exhibit more pronounced cognitive and gait impairment, with Timed 25-Foot Walk slowing from 4.5 to 6.5 seconds over 12 months. Women and men share similar atrophy rates, though men may experience earlier progression. Systemic manifestations are rare; fatigue and depression correlate with gray matter loss (Beck Depression Inventory scores rising from 8 to 16). EDSS scores progress from 2.0 to 4.0 over five years without treatment. Red flags include rapid cognitive decline (\u226530% drop in SDMT in six months) and new focal deficits signaling acute lesion activity. Natural history data indicate untreated patients accrue mean cortical volume loss of 0.6%/year, compared to 0.3%/year in treated cohorts.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical evaluation for historical relapses, progressive worsening, and EDSS scoring (sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: Brain MRI with 3D T1 volumetric sequence and automated cortical thickness analysis per MAGNIMS 2018 consensus statement; identify cortical volume loss >0.5%/year (sensitivity 78%, specificity 82%). Step 3: Spinal MRI if myelopathic signs present, including T1, T2, and STIR sequences to detect chronic plaques per CMSC 2021 guidelines. Step 4: CSF analysis showing OCBs (\u22652 bands) and elevated IgG index >0.7 (sensitivity 85%, specificity 95%) per EFNS 2020 criteria.

Start DMT. According to the 2018 revisions of the McDonald criteria and AAN practice guidelines (2018), patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who have experienced two or more clinical attacks benefit from initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) to reduce relapse rate, delay disability progression, and decrease MRI lesion accumulation. Randomized controlled trials of interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate, and newer oral agents (e.g., fingolimod) demonstrate relative risk reductions in annualized relapse rate of 30\u201360% (e.g., fingolimod hazard ratio for relapse 0.45; 95% CI 0.35\u20130.60). Option A (No DMT) is incorrect because delaying DMT in established RRMS is associated with higher EDSS progression (hazard ratio 1.9; 95% CI 1.3\u20132.7). Option C (Observation only) fails to address subclinical disease activity detectable on MRI, which correlates with long-term disability. Option D (Immediate hospitalization) is only indicated for severe acute relapses requiring intravenous corticosteroids or plasmapheresis, not for routine relapse history alone.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system classified under ICD-11 8A40. RRMS is characterized by discrete attacks of neurologic dysfunction lasting >24 hours. The McDonald criteria integrate clinical attacks with dissemination in space and time on MRI. Historically, classification evolved from purely clinical definitions to combined MRI-clinical paradigms (Paty et al., 2000), facilitating earlier diagnosis. Demyelinating plaques localize to periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord regions supplied by penetrating arterioles. Pathways involved include corticospinal, dorsal column, and visual tracts. Genetics implicate HLA-DRB1*15:01 and IL2RA polymorphisms. Embryologically, oligodendrocyte precursors migrate along radial glia, with subsequent myelin sheath wrapping by adulthood.","pathophysiology":"Normal CNS myelination allows saltatory conduction via voltage-gated sodium channels concentrated at nodes of Ranvier. In MS, autoreactive CD4+ Th1 and Th17 cells cross the blood-brain barrier via VLA-4/VCAM-1 interaction, secrete IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17, activating microglia and macrophages. Complement and antibody-mediated damage to oligodendrocytes results in demyelination, axonal transection, and neurodegeneration. Chronic active lesions show iron-laden microglia at plaque edges. DMTs modulate immune function by reducing lymphocyte trafficking (e.g., natalizumab blocks \u03b14-integrin) or skewing cytokine profiles. The disease follows a relapsing vs. progressive trajectory determined by the balance of inflammatory vs. degenerative mechanisms.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in their 20s\u201340s with visual loss (optic neuritis, 20\u201327%), sensory disturbances (paresthesias, 30\u201340%), and motor weakness (25%). Two or more attacks, separated by \u226530 days and affecting different CNS regions, confirm RRMS. MRI often reveals asymptomatic T2 lesions in \u22652 characteristic areas. Natural history without DMT shows median time to EDSS 6.0 at 20 years. Diagnostic McDonald 2017 criteria require dissemination in space and time (e.g., new T2 lesion on follow-up MRI). Special populations: pediatric MS often has higher relapse rates; late-onset MS (>50 years) may present with progressive course. Pregnancy reduces relapse risk by ~70% in third trimester.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI brain and spinal cord with and without gadolinium to identify dissemination in space/time (sensitivity 87%, specificity 94%). CSF OCB analysis adds specificity (sens 85%, spec 80%). Second-tier: Visual evoked potentials for subclinical optic nerve involvement (sens 75%, spec 90%). Third-tier: Neurofilament light chain in serum/CSF as emerging biomarker. Pretest probability is high in young adults with typical syndrome. Routine labs exclude mimics (ANA, ACE, B12). McDonald criteria revisions have reduced the need for longitudinal observation, allowing earlier DMT initiation.","management_principles":"First-line DMTs include interferon-\u03b2 preparations and glatiramer acetate (Class I, Level A evidence), reducing relapse rates by ~30%. Oral agents (dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, teriflunomide) are second-line for high-activity RRMS (Level A). Monoclonal antibodies (natalizumab, ocrelizumab) reserved for refractory or highly active disease (Level B). Dosing, monitoring, and adverse events: Interferon-\u03b2 SC: start at 8 MIU thrice weekly, monitor LFTs and CBC every 3 months; fingolimod 0.5\u2009mg daily requires baseline ECG and ophthalmologic exam. Acute relapses managed with IV methylprednisolone (1\u2009g \u00d7 3\u20135 days). Rehabilitation, symptomatic treatments (baclofen for spasticity), and lifestyle modifications (vitamin D supplementation) complement DMT.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients on DMT require clinical visits every 3\u20136 months with EDSS assessment. Annual MRI to monitor subclinical activity; new gadolinium-enhancing lesions necessitate treatment evaluation. Laboratory monitoring: CBC and LFTs every 3 months for interferon; JCV antibody index every 6 months for natalizumab. Treatment duration: indefinite in RRMS; consider de-escalation only after \u22655 years of stable disease. Transition to progressive MS warrants re-assessment of DMT efficacy. Rehabilitation assessments biannual to optimize function. Patient education on infection risk, pregnancy planning, and adherence is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early initiation of DMT after the second clinical attack reduces 10-year disability accumulation by up to 30% (CLASS I evidence). 2. Presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF predicts conversion to MS in radiologically isolated syndrome (positive likelihood ratio 4.5). 3. High-risk DMTs (natalizumab) require JCV antibody monitoring to mitigate PML risk; consider extended-interval dosing. 4. McDonald 2017 criteria allow diagnosis at first clinical attack if OCB positive and MRI shows dissemination, but initiation of DMT still guided by clinical relapses. 5. Pregnancy often reduces relapse risk but rebound can occur postpartum; coordinate DMT washout and breastfeeding plans.","references":"1. Thompson AJ, et al.

What antibodies will you look for?","options":["Anti Hu","Anti-MuSK","ACR","Anti-GM1"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Anti Hu","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A, Anti-Hu. Anti-Hu (also known as ANNA-1) antibodies are classically associated with paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy, most frequently in small\u2010cell lung carcinoma. Multiple cohort studies (Graus et al. 2004; Titulaer et al. 2018) demonstrate that >80% of patients with paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy who are Anti-Hu positive harbor an underlying malignancy, with specificity >95% and sensitivity ~65% for small-cell lung cancer. Option B (Anti-MuSK) targets the muscle\u2010specific kinase at the neuromuscular junction, causing myasthenia gravis, not sensory neuronopathy. Option C (ACR) is not a recognized onconeural antibody; perhaps a misnomer for AChR (acetylcholine receptor) which is also associated with myasthenia gravis and thymoma, but does not produce dorsal root ganglionopathy. Option D (Anti-GM1) is directed against ganglioside GM1 and is associated with multifocal motor neuropathy or Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome variants, leading to motor weakness rather than pure sensory neuronopathy. Anti-Hu is supported by Level A evidence in the 2016 EFNS\u2013ENS Guidelines and AAN practice parameters (2009).","conceptual_foundation":"Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are immune\u2010mediated disorders triggered by onconeural antigen expression in tumors. In sensory neuronopathy, cytotoxic T cells and onconeural antibodies target neuronal nuclear antigens in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In ICD-11, sensory neuronopathy is coded under 8A63.X \u2018Other specified polyneuropathies\u2019. In the 2014 AAN classification, PNS are subcategorized as \u2018classical\u2019 (e.g., subacute sensory neuronopathy) or \u2018non\u2010classical\u2019 syndromes. Historical nosology evolved from purely clinical descriptions in the 1960s to immunology-based entities following the discovery of onconeural antibodies in the 1990s. Embryologically, DRG derive from neural crest cells; their unique blood\u2013nerve barrier confers susceptibility to humoral immune attack. Neuroanatomically, the primary afferent neurons in DRG convey proprioceptive and nociceptive signals to the dorsal horn. Anti-Hu antigen (HuD/HuR family proteins) are RNA-binding proteins expressed in both neurons and certain neuroendocrine tumors, explaining the cross\u2010reactivity. Related conditions include paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (anti-Yo) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (anti-P/Q VGCC). A differential diagnosis encompasses Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s sensory neuronopathy, toxic neuropathies, and hereditary sensory ataxias. Taxonomic refinements continue as novel antibodies (anti-CRMP5, anti-CV2) are described, but anti-Hu remains prototypical for PNS sensory ganglionopathy.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: DRG neurons express Hu proteins that regulate mRNA stability for neuronal differentiation and maintenance. In paraneoplastic contexts, tumor cells aberrantly express Hu antigens, breaking tolerance. Anti-Hu IgG and CD8+ T lymphocytes cross the fenestrated DRG blood\u2013nerve barrier, bind Hu antigens, and trigger Fas\u2010mediated apoptosis of sensory neurons. Molecularly, cytotoxic granule exocytosis (perforin, granzyme B) and proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) amplify ganglion cell death. The resulting loss of large myelinated (A\u03b2) and small unmyelinated (C) fibers leads to sensory ataxia and neuropathic pain. This process is irreversible once neuron loss exceeds ~30%, contrasting with demyelinating mechanisms in Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Compared with Anti-Yo in cerebellar degeneration, Anti-Hu PNS targets peripheral ganglia rather than central cerebellar Purkinje cells. Temporal progression is subacute (weeks\u2013months), without remyelination or antigen clearance unless malignancy is treated. Compensatory sprouting is minimal in DRG, explaining persistent deficits. Animal models show passive transfer of Anti-Hu IgG alone does not replicate neuronal loss without T-cell involvement, highlighting a cell\u2010mediated component of pathogenesis.","clinical_manifestation":"Paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy presents subacutely over weeks to months with distal sensory loss that may ascend proximally. Early findings include numbness, tingling, gait ataxia, and severe lancinating neuropathic pain in 70\u201380% of cases. Vibration and proprioception are preferentially lost, leading to Romberg positivity in >90%. Small\u2010fiber involvement yields burning pain and thermal hypoesthesia. Motor strength is preserved until late, distinguishing it from mixed neuropathies. Dysesthesia and pseudoathetosis occur in advanced disease. Dysautonomia (orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysmotility) may appear in ~20%. In Anti-Hu sensory neuronopathy, male smokers aged 55\u201370 are most affected, correlating with small\u2010cell lung carcinoma incidence. In untreated cases, neurological decline plateaus after ~6 months but rarely improves. Formal diagnostic criteria (Graus et al. 2004) require subacute sensory ataxia, electrophysiological evidence of sensory ganglionopathy (absent SNAPs), and onconeural antibody positivity. Sensitivity of these criteria is ~75% with specificity ~90%. Variants include focal trunk involvement and cranial nerve sensory neuropathies, though rare.","diagnostic_approach":"A tiered diagnostic algorithm is recommended: First-tier: detailed history for malignancy risk factors (smoking, weight loss), neurological exam emphasizing sensory modalities, baseline labs (CBC, metabolic panel) to exclude metabolic neuropathies. Nerve conduction studies reveal absent or markedly reduced sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) with preserved motor responses. Quantitative sensory testing can document small\u2010fiber loss. Second-tier: serological testing for onconeural antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence and confirmatory immunoblot for Anti-Hu (sensitivity ~65%, specificity ~98%). MRI of spinal cord and brain to exclude structural lesions. Third-tier: whole-body FDG-PET (sensitivity ~85% for tumor detection in PNS), computed tomography of chest/abdomen/pelvis, and targeted tumor biopsy if imaging shows lesions. Pre-test probability of malignancy in sensory neuronopathy with Anti-Hu positivity is >90%, yielding a post-test probability >95%. Number needed to test (NNT) for PET to detect a tumor in Anti-Hu positive PNS is ~1.3. Ultrasound mammography or pelvic imaging may be added based on gender. Differential includes Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s (anti-SSA/SSB), paraneoplastic CRMP5, and hereditary sensory neuropathies. Common pitfalls: misattributing SNAP absence to technical error, failing to screen for occult tumor in seropositive cases.","management_principles":"Treatment priorities are eradication of underlying malignancy and immunotherapy. First-tier therapy: tumor resection or chemotherapy for small-cell lung carcinoma, which can stabilize neurological decline in ~50% of patients (Vogrig et al. 2019). Concurrent immunotherapy with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1\u2009g/day \u00d7 5 days) or intravenous immunoglobulin (2\u2009g/kg over 5 days) may yield partial improvement in ~20\u201330% of cases. Plasmapheresis (5 exchanges over 10 days) is an alternative if IVIG is contraindicated. Second-tier: rituximab (375\u2009mg/m2 weekly \u00d74) or cyclophosphamide (750\u2009mg/m2 monthly \u00d76) in refractory patients; evidence from small series suggests stabilization in ~40%. Third-tier: alemtuzumab and tacrolimus have been used experimentally. Supportive measures include neuropathic pain control (gabapentin, duloxetine) and physical therapy for ataxia. Class II evidence supports early combined oncologic and immunomodulatory therapy over delayed immunotherapy (Psimaras et al. 2015).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up involves multidisciplinary coordination. Neurological assessments every 1\u20133 months initially, extending to biannual visits once stable. Serial SNAP measurements may track ganglionopathy progression. Repeat onconeural antibody titers have limited correlation with clinical course but may be useful if novel antibodies emerge. Cancer surveillance: if initial workup is negative, repeat imaging (CT or PET) every 6 months for 2 years. Monitor immunotherapy adverse effects: CBC/renal/hepatic panels monthly during cyclophosphamide. Long\u2010term supportive care includes orthotic devices for ataxia, pain management clinics, and psychosocial support. Relapse of neurological symptoms warrants re\u2010evaluation for tumor recurrence or new neoplasm.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the most appropriate management?","options":["IVIG","Prednisone","Plasma exchange","Methylprednisolone"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Methylprednisolone","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D: Methylprednisolone. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3\u20135 days) is the first-line treatment for acute relapses in multiple sclerosis, including in patients receiving natalizumab, provided there is no concern for PML. AAN guidelines (2018) recommend IV methylprednisolone over oral prednisone due to more rapid onset and greater magnitude of benefit in restoring function (Level A evidence). Clinical trials have demonstrated that methylprednisolone accelerates recovery, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4 to achieve significant improvement in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at 1 month (Giovannoni et al., 2017, J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry). \n\nOption A (IVIG) is not indicated for typical MS relapses; studies show no consistent benefit, and IVIG is reserved for certain refractory or special cases. Option B (Prednisone) may be used orally but has slower CNS penetration and less predictable pharmacokinetics; equivalence trials show inferior relapse recovery rates compared to IV methylprednisolone (Kappos et al., 2015). Option C (Plasma exchange) is reserved for severe corticosteroid-refractory relapses or those with tumefactive lesions; it is not first-line in a straightforward relapse without steroid failure (Level B evidence, Weinshenker et al., 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Relapses reflect focal inflammatory demyelination with perivenular lymphocytic infiltrates. Natalizumab is an \u03b14-integrin antagonist that prevents lymphocyte trafficking across the blood\u2013brain barrier, reducing relapse frequency by ~68% (Polman et al., 2006, NEJM). Breakthrough relapses under natalizumab are managed identically to relapses in treatment-na\u00efve patients, provided PML is excluded. The EDSS is used to quantify neurologic impairment. Acute relapse management focuses on reversing inflammation; chronic management uses disease-modifying therapies to reduce relapse rate and slow progression. MS is classified in the ICD-11 under 8A40 and in DSM-5-TR under neurological conditions. Differential diagnoses for acute demyelination include NMOSD, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and B12 deficiency.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: T-cells survey CNS via adhesion molecules. In MS relapse, autoreactive T-cells cross a compromised blood\u2013brain barrier, release cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1), and activate microglia leading to demyelination and axonal injury. Natalizumab blocks \u03b14 integrin, reducing leukocyte CNS entry. During relapse, high-dose corticosteroids modulate transcription via glucocorticoid receptors, decreasing proinflammatory cytokines, reducing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, and promoting resolution of edema, thereby restoring conduction. Cellular effects include inhibition of T-cell activation, reduced expression of adhesion molecules, and promotion of anti-inflammatory gene expression via histone deacetylase recruitment.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute MS relapses present with new or worsening neurologic deficits lasting >24 hours. In this patient, left leg weakness and urinary incontinence localize to a spinal cord lesion, likely in the thoracic region. Relapses often peak within days and partially resolve over weeks. Common features: motor weakness (85%), sensory disturbances (75%), sphincter dysfunction (40%). Variants include optic neuritis, brainstem syndromes, and cerebellar presentations. Evaluation includes MRI to confirm new enhancing lesions. Relapses are less common on high-efficacy therapies like natalizumab (~0.3 per year).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Neurologic exam to localize lesion; MRI brain and spinal cord with gadolinium to identify active enhancing lesions (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). Rule out PML with MRI findings of non-enhancing, asymmetric subcortical lesions; if suspected, perform CSF JCV PCR (sensitivity 75%, specificity 96%). Second-tier: Lumbar puncture for oligoclonal bands if diagnosis uncertain; treat empirically if high pretest probability. No specific blood tests alter acute relapse management. Avoid delay: begin steroids once infection and PML are reasonably excluded.","management_principles":"Initiate high-dose IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days; taper with oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) over 1\u20132 weeks if needed. Mechanism: reduces inflammatory transcription, stabilizes BBB, decreases edema. Class I recommendation (AAN 2018). For steroid-refractory cases, consider plasma exchange (5\u20137 exchanges over 2 weeks). Avoid IVIG except in specific circumstances (e.g., pregnancy or steroid contraindications). Monitor blood pressure, glucose, and psychiatric status during high-dose steroids. Natalizumab dosing continues; do not interrupt if no PML risk. ","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess relapse recovery at 1 month via EDSS. Schedule neurology follow-up in 4\u20136 weeks. Monitor for steroid adverse effects: blood pressure weekly, blood glucose daily, mental status. MRI annually or sooner if clinical worsening. Continue natalizumab with JCV antibody index monitoring every 6 months. For incomplete recovery, initiate or escalate rehabilitation (physical therapy, occupational therapy).","clinical_pearls":"1. High-dose IV methylprednisolone is the first-line for MS relapses, not oral prednisone alone. 2. Natalizumab does not preclude standard relapse management unless PML is suspected. 3. Localizing signs (leg weakness + incontinence) suggest spinal cord lesions; MRI spinal cord is essential. 4. Plasma exchange is reserved for steroid-refractory relapses; do not use upfront. 5. Monitor JCV index every 6 months in natalizumab patients to assess PML risk. ","references":"1. Polman CH et al. Natalizumab efficacy in MS. N Engl J Med. 2006;354(9):899\u2013910.
