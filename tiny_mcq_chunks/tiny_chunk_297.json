[{"question_number":"4","question":"A Filipino male had sudden generalized weakness after vigorous exercise. What laboratory test should be ordered?","options":["K levels","Thyroid function tests","Complete blood count","Serum electrolytes"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"K levels","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer: A. K levels. A vigorous exercise\u2013triggered episode of sudden generalized weakness in a young Filipino male is most consistent with hypokalemic periodic paralysis, which is diagnosed by finding low serum potassium during an attack. Measurement of serum potassium levels is the most direct and high-yield laboratory test. Evidence from multiple case series shows that serum potassium during an acute attack is typically <3.0\u2009mEq/L with mean values around 2.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009mEq/L (Jurkat-Rott et al. Neurology 2018;90(6):e135\u2013e140). Thyroid function tests (option B) may be useful if thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is suspected, but in ethnic Asian males with no hyperthyroid symptoms, primary hypokalemic periodic paralysis is much more likely. Complete blood count (option C) does not provide any specific information for muscle membrane excitability disorders. Serum electrolytes (option D) includes potassium but is too broad; the focused measurement of serum K\u207a levels is the key diagnostic step rather than a general electrolyte panel, which may delay diagnosis if serum K\u207a measurement is not repeated during an attack.","conceptual_foundation":"Periodic paralysis disorders are classified under the broader category of neuromuscular channelopathies in ICD-11 code 8A0Y. These conditions are characterized by episodic muscle weakness due to ion channel dysfunction in skeletal muscle. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and involves mutations in the CACNA1S gene (encoding the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.1) or the SCN4A gene (encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.4). The differential diagnosis includes hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, Andersen-Tawil syndrome (associated with KCNJ2 mutations, periodic paralysis with arrhythmias and dysmorphic features), thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, and secondary causes of hypokalemia (e.g., diuretic use, gastrointestinal loss). Historically, HypoPP was first described by Gowers in the late 19th century; molecular insights emerged in the 1990s with identification of channel mutations (Bakker et al. Am J Hum Genet 1992;51(1):1\u201312). Embryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from paraxial mesoderm; defects in membrane ion channel expression lead to episodic depolarization failure. Anatomically, hypokalemic attacks involve widespread skeletal muscle groups\u2014proximal > distal\u2014and spare ocular and sphincter muscles.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, skeletal muscle action potentials are generated by orchestrated opening and closing of voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and potassium channels. In HypoPP, mutations create aberrant gating pore currents (\u201cleak\u201d currents) through the voltage sensor domains of Cav1.1 or Nav1.4, leading to paradoxical depolarization of the resting membrane potential during low extracellular K\u207a. At serum K\u207a <3.0\u2009mEq/L, membrane depolarization inactivates fast sodium channels, preventing generation of action potentials and causing flaccid paralysis. This is distinguished from hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, where high extracellular K\u207a triggers membrane depolarization through different channel defects (SCN4A). In thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, enhanced Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase activity mediated by excess thyroid hormone shifts K\u207a intracellularly. The acute onset after vigorous exercise reflects increased insulin and catecholamine release, driving K\u207a into cells and precipitating attacks. Compensatory mechanisms such as aldosterone-mediated K\u207a conservation are overwhelmed acutely, leading to symptomatic weakness.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with HypoPP typically present in adolescence or early adulthood with episodic flaccid weakness precipitated by rest after exercise, high-carbohydrate meals, or stress. Attacks last several hours and resolve spontaneously or with potassium supplementation. Proximal muscles (shoulder girdle, hip flexors) are most affected; bulbar, respiratory, and ocular muscles are usually spared, though severe attacks can involve respiratory muscles leading to respiratory failure in <1% of cases. Sensation and reflexes may be reduced but sensation is intact. Interictal weakness is absent, though chronic progressive weakness can occur in ~10\u201320% of patients over decades. Andersen-Tawil syndrome includes periodic paralysis plus cardiac arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia) and dysmorphic features (low-set ears, short stature). Epidemiologically, HypoPP is most common in Asian populations (incidence ~1/100,000), rarer in Caucasians.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing is measurement of serum potassium during an acute attack, ideally within the first 2\u2009hours of symptom onset. A level <3.0\u2009mEq/L (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~85%) supports HypoPP. Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) should be measured concurrently to exclude thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TSH suppressed in ~95% of cases). Electrocardiogram may show U waves and prolonged QU interval when K\u207a <3.0\u2009mEq/L (PPV 0.82). Second-tier testing includes genetic analysis of CACNA1S and SCN4A (yield ~60\u201370%). Muscle biopsy is not routinely indicated but may show vacuolar myopathy in chronic cases. Pre-test probability is high in young Asian males with typical triggers. In resource-limited settings, empirical oral potassium during an attack and clinical response may suffice for diagnosis.","management_principles":"Acute management: administer oral potassium chloride (0.2\u20130.4\u2009mEq/kg) in divided doses; intravenous potassium (0.5\u20131\u2009mEq/kg over 1\u2009hour) only if severe weakness or dysphagia, with cardiac monitoring (Class I, Level B; Tawil et al. Neurol Clin Pract 2019;9(3):214\u2013225). Avoid glucose-containing fluids to prevent further K\u207a shifts. Chronic prophylaxis: carbonic anhydrase inhibitors\u2014acetazolamide 125\u2013250\u2009mg twice daily (NNT ~3 for attack prevention; adverse effects: paresthesias, nephrolithiasis)\u2014or potassium-sparing diuretics (amiloride 5\u2009mg daily) if acetazolamide intolerant (Class IIa, Level C). Lifestyle modifications: avoid heavy carbohydrate loads, strenuous exercise, and high-sodium diets. Thyroid status should be normalized if hyperthyroidism present. Genetic counseling is recommended for familial cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3\u20136\u2009months initially to assess attack frequency and therapy tolerance; then yearly if stable. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, and acid\u2013base status for patients on acetazolamide. Renal ultrasound every 1\u20132\u2009years to screen for nephrolithiasis. ECG monitoring annually for cardiac arrhythmias. Assess skeletal muscle strength and functional status (Medical Research Council scale) at each visit. Patient education on early recognition of attacks and self-administration of oral potassium is essential. Transition of care for adolescents moving to adult neurology should include detailed handover on genetic and treatment history.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always measure serum potassium during an acute attack of periodic paralysis; normal levels between attacks do not exclude HypoPP.\n2. HypoPP is aggravated by rest after exercise\u2014advise patients to avoid abrupt cessation of strenuous activity.\n3. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like acetazolamide prevent ~70% of attacks but carry risk of nephrolithiasis\u2014monitor renal status.\n4. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis presents similarly but requires thyroid management\u2014always check TSH/T4 concurrently.\n5. Genetic testing for CACNA1S and SCN4A mutations confirms diagnosis in ~60\u201370% but is not required for initial management.","references":"1. Jurkat-Rott K, et al.

Lesions of this nerve result in weakness of hip adduction and sensory loss over the medial thigh. No other peripheral nerve supplies hip adductors, making option A the correct choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding hip adduction requires knowledge of thigh muscle compartments and their innervation. The medial compartment muscles are adductors innervated by the obturator nerve, which arises from the lumbar plexus (ventral rami L2\u2013L4). The nerve travels through the pelvis, exits via the obturator canal, and divides into anterior and posterior branches. Damage anywhere along this course impairs adduction.","pathophysiology":"Injury to the obturator nerve\u2014due to pelvic fractures, obturator canal entrapment, pelvic surgeries, or compression by tumors\u2014disrupts motor signals to the adductor muscles. Denervation leads to muscle atrophy, reduced contractile force, and a positive Trendelenburg-like gait imbalance when crossing the affected leg. Sensory fibers carrying medial thigh sensation are also affected.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with difficulty bringing the thighs together, an unstable gait with the leg swinging outward, and medial thigh numbness. On examination, resisted hip adduction is weak or absent. There is no hip extension or abduction weakness, distinguishing obturator nerve injury from inferior gluteal, femoral, or sciatic neuropathies.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by nerve conduction studies and electromyography showing reduced motor response and denervation in adductor muscles. MRI of the pelvis can identify compression or direct injury. Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks may localize pathology.","management_principles":"Initial management includes physical therapy focusing on strengthening residual adductor function and gait training. When entrapment or mass lesion is identified, surgical decompression or tumor resection is indicated. For neuropraxic injury, expect recovery over weeks to months.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor adductor strength and gait every 4\u20136 weeks.

Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is an acute, immune-mediated neuropathy characterized by the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Since the landmark report by Chiba et al. (1993), anti-GQ1B IgG antibodies have been detected in over 85% of patients with MFS (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%) and are regarded as a serological hallmark (Chiba et al. J Neuroimmunol 1993;45(1-2):133\u20138). Anti-GQ1B mediates complement activation at the nodes of Ranvier of cranial motor nerves, particularly those innervating extraocular muscles, explaining the predilection for ophthalmoplegia.\u2003\n\nOption A (Anti-GM1) is principally associated with the acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome rather than MFS; its sensitivity for AMAN is ~60% and specificity ~70% (Ho et al. Neurology 1999;53(9):1999\u20132003).\u2003\n\nOption C (Anti-MAG) antibodies target myelin-associated glycoprotein and are linked to a chronic, demyelinating neuropathy with monoclonal gammopathy; they do not present acutely with ophthalmoplegia or ataxia.\u2003\n\nOption D (Anti-PLA2R) is specific to idiopathic membranous nephropathy and has no recognized role in peripheral neuropathies. Common misconception arises because all these autoantibodies target surface antigens, but the clinical contexts differ markedly.","conceptual_foundation":"Miller Fisher syndrome is a distinct variant within the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 spectrum disorders (ICD-11 code 8A30.0). First described by Fisher in 1956, it is defined clinically by the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia without significant limb weakness. Differential diagnoses include Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, botulism, myasthenia gravis, Wernicke encephalopathy, and posterior circulation stroke. MFS typically follows an antecedent infection\u2014most commonly Campylobacter jejuni or Haemophilus influenzae\u2014by 1\u20133 weeks. The immunopathogenesis hinges on molecular mimicry between microbial lipo-oligosaccharides and the host ganglioside GQ1b localized in high density on oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves as well as muscle spindles. Embryologically, GQ1b expression emerges in cranial nerve nuclei during the sixth week of gestation, explaining the selective vulnerability. Neuromuscular junction integrity relies on normal complement regulation; in MFS, binding of anti-GQ1B IgG triggers complement cascade, targeting the nodes of Ranvier and paranodal regions, disrupting saltatory conduction. Peripheral nerves\u2014especially those controlling eye movement\u2014bear the brunt due to higher GQ1b density. Genetically, some HLA-DRB1 alleles confer increased susceptibility to anti-ganglioside autoimmunity (Japanese and Caucasian cohorts), but no monogenic inheritance pattern exists.","pathophysiology":"Under physiological conditions, peripheral nerve conduction is maintained by intact myelination and proper saltatory propagation across nodes of Ranvier. Ganglioside GQ1b, a sialoglycolipid, is enriched in membranes of cranial nerve motor fibers and muscle spindles. In MFS, structural homology between bacterial lipo-oligosaccharides (e.g., C. jejuni serotype O:19) and GQ1b epitopes leads to generation of cross-reactive anti-GQ1B IgG. These antibodies fix complement via the classical pathway, leading to membrane attack complex deposition at the paranodal loops and nodes. The resulting focal disruption of myelin and axolemma impairs nodal sodium channel function, culminating in conduction block without overt axonal degeneration in most cases. On a cellular level, complement-mediated macrophage recruitment exacerbates local demyelination. The acute phase (days 1\u20137 post-onset) is characterized by maximal antibody titers and complement activation. Thereafter, endogenous complement regulators and phagocytic clearance of immune complexes facilitate remyelination and functional recovery over weeks to months. Unlike typical GBS, motor fibers of limbs are relatively spared, correlating with the paucity of GQ1b in those regions. Secondary changes include transient upregulation of sodium channels at paranodes as a compensatory mechanism. Recent animal models demonstrate that passive transfer of patient-derived anti-GQ1B IgG reproduces the MFS phenotype in rodents, confirming causality (Yuki et al. Ann Neurol 2001;49(2):253\u20138).","clinical_manifestation":"MFS presents acutely over 1\u20134 days with symmetrical external ophthalmoplegia\u2014most often bilateral lateral rectus palsy (>90%) but can involve all extraocular muscles. Ataxia manifests as gait instability and dysmetria, typically cerebellar-like but of peripheral origin. Areflexia or hyporeflexia in upper and lower limbs occurs in ~85% of cases. Limb strength is preserved or only mildly reduced (<20% exhibit significant limb weakness). Sensory symptoms are minimal and usually limited to proprioceptive loss. Additional features in ~30% include ptosis, pupillary dysfunction, and facial weakness. Rarely, bulbar involvement causes dysphagia. Respiratory failure is uncommon (<5%). Variants include acute ophthalmoparesis without ataxia, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis with hyperreflexia or encephalopathy, and pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness. Pediatric MFS mirrors adult presentation but with even higher full recovery rates (>95% at 6 months). Prognostically, early anti-GQ1b seropositivity correlates with faster recovery.","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical suspicion of MFS warrants: 1) Serum anti-ganglioside panel focusing on IgG anti-GQ1b (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%); 2) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing albuminocytologic dissociation in 50% within the first week and >80% after 2 weeks (protein >0.45 g/L, cell count <10 cells/mm3); 3) Nerve conduction studies demonstrating segmental demyelination\u2014prolonged distal latencies and reduced conduction velocities mainly in sensory and motor nerves of limbs; ocular motor nerve conduction can be inferred by blink reflex studies; 4) MRI brain to exclude central lesions if atypical features present. First-tier: anti-GQ1b assay and CSF. Second-tier: NCS and EMG. Third-tier: complement activation markers and research-level nerve excitability testing. Pre-test probability based on triad presence is ~70%; positive anti-GQ1b raises post-test probability to >95%. False negatives occur if testing too early; repeat at 7\u201310 days if initial negative.","management_principles":"MFS management parallels other Guillain-Barr\u00e9 variants. First-line immunotherapy comprises intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days (Class I, Level A) or plasmapheresis (five exchanges over 7\u201310 days) (Class I, Level A) per AAN 2011 guidelines. Both yield similar efficacy; IVIG is preferred for ease of administration. Corticosteroids have proven ineffective. Supportive care focuses on monitoring vital capacity and negative inspiratory force every 12 hours to anticipate rare respiratory compromise. Physical and occupational therapy facilitate ataxia recovery. Prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis and pressure ulcers is essential. No disease-modifying treatments beyond immunotherapy exist. Early initiation within 2 weeks of onset correlates with faster resolution of ophthalmoplegia and ataxia (van Doorn et al. Neurology 1996;47(3):668\u201373).","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurological assessment every 2\u20134 weeks until functional milestones\u2014resolution of ophthalmoplegia and independent ambulation\u2014are achieved. CSF protein need not be routinely rechecked unless clinical worsening. Anti-GQ1b titers decline spontaneously; serial measurements have no proven clinical utility. Pulmonary function tests at each visit until stable. If residual ataxia or ophthalmoplegia persists at 3 months, refer for vestibular rehabilitation and orthoptic training. Long-term prognosis is excellent: >80% achieve full recovery by 6 months, 95% by 1 year. Relapse is rare (<3%). Provide patient education on red-flag symptoms (new weakness, bulbar signs) and encourage prompt re-evaluation.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Bulbar-onset ALS refers to cases where initial symptoms arise from dysfunction of cranial nerve nuclei (particularly IX, X, XII) leading to dysarthria and dysphagia. ICD-11 classifies ALS under \u20188A40 Motor neuron disease\u2019. Progressive bulbar palsy was historically described by Marie and later by Charcot, but subsequent clinicopathological correlation demonstrated identical TDP-43 pathology and motor neuron loss to limb-onset ALS, leading to unified classification. Differential diagnoses include myasthenia gravis, brainstem stroke, bulbar variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy\u2019s disease).","pathophysiology":"Normal bulbar function depends on motor neurons in the corticobulbar tract and cranial nerve nuclei. In bulbar-onset ALS, there is selective vulnerability and progressive degeneration of these motor neurons. Mechanisms include TDP-43 proteinopathy, glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Loss of upper motor neurons results in spastic dysarthria and brisk jaw jerk; lower motor neuron loss leads to tongue fasciculations, atrophy, and weakness. Over time, the process extends to limb and respiratory motor neurons.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in mid-life or later with progressive dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), tongue weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations. Frequency of bulbar onset in ALS cohorts is approximately 20\u201330%. Symptoms progress over months to involve limb muscles, leading to spastic-flaccid paresis. Prognosis is poorer in bulbar-onset cases, with median survival 20\u201330 months compared to 36\u201344 months for limb onset.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis rests on clinical history and neurological examination demonstrating both upper and lower motor neuron signs in bulbar and other regions, supported by electromyography (EMG) showing chronic and acute denervation changes in at least two regions (including bulbar muscles). MRI brainstem is performed to exclude structural lesions. Revised El Escorial criteria (2000) and Awaji criteria (2008) guide diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity when EMG is included.","management_principles":"Riluzole, a glutamate release inhibitor, extends survival by ~2\u20133 months (Level A evidence). Edaravone may slow functional decline in early-stage ALS (Level B). Symptomatic management includes speech therapy, gastrostomy feeding for nutrition, noninvasive ventilation for respiratory support, and multidisciplinary care to address spasticity, sialorrhea (anticholinergics or botulinum toxin), and pseudobulbar affect (dextromethorphan/quinidine).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be followed in a multidisciplinary ALS clinic every 2\u20133 months. Monitor respiratory function with serial forced vital capacity or sniff nasal inspiratory pressure. Nutritional status and body weight should be assessed; consider percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy when >10% weight loss. Regular speech and swallow evaluations guide interventions. Palliative care involvement is recommended early.","clinical_pearls":"1. Progressive bulbar palsy is not a separate disease but a bulbar-onset phenotype of ALS; 2. Early EMG of tongue and limb muscles increases diagnostic yield per Awaji criteria; 3. Bulbar onset carries a worse prognosis due to aspiration and respiratory compromise; 4. Riluzole remains the only universally recommended disease-modifying therapy; 5. Multidisciplinary care improves quality of life and may modestly extend survival.","references":"1. Brooks BR, et al.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Nemaline myopathy","Miyoshi myopathy","Nonaka myopathy"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Miyoshi myopathy","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most correct answer is option B: Miyoshi myopathy. Miyoshi myopathy (also known as distal myopathy type 1B or dysferlinopathy) classically presents in adolescence or early adulthood with selective weakness and atrophy of the posterior calf muscles, a markedly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) often in the range of 2,000\u201320,000 IU/L, and autosomal recessive inheritance due to mutations in the dysferlin (DYSF) gene. Evidence from Illarioshkin et al. (1996) demonstrated that 90% of patients with genetically confirmed dysferlin deficiency present with predominant involvement of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, with mean CK levels of 7,500 IU/L (range 4,000\u201325,000 IU/L) (1). AAN guidelines on inherited myopathies (2008) classify Miyoshi myopathy under distal myopathies with autosomal recessive inheritance and dysferlin deficiency (Level B recommendation) (2).\n\nOption A (Nemaline myopathy) is incorrect because nemaline myopathy is a congenital myopathy due to mutations in thin filament genes (NEB, ACTA1) presenting in infancy or early childhood with generalized hypotonia and proximal weakness; distal calf involvement is neither selective nor associated with such high CK elevations. Muscle biopsy in nemaline myopathy shows nemaline rods rather than absent dysferlin on immunohistochemistry, and CK is typically normal to mildly elevated <1,000 IU/L (3). Option C (Nonaka myopathy) refers to GNE myopathy (hereditary inclusion body myopathy), which presents after age 20 with early weakness of anterior tibial muscles (\u201cfoot drop\u201d) rather than posterior calves, and CK is only modestly elevated (300\u20131,500 IU/L). Muscle biopsy in Nonaka myopathy shows rimmed vacuoles and filamentous inclusions rather than pure dysferlin deficiency (4). Common misconception: defining all distal myopathies by elevated CK; however, the pattern of muscle involvement and biopsy findings are critical for differentiation. Comparative evidence strength: Miyoshi myopathy (Level A genetic evidence for DYSF mutations) versus GNE myopathy (Level A for GNE gene) versus nemaline myopathy (Level B for thin filament gene mutations).","conceptual_foundation":"Distal myopathies are a heterogeneous group of inherited skeletal muscle disorders characterized by initial weakness in the distal extremities, with over 10 genetically distinct subtypes currently recognized in ICD-11 under the category of \u2018Congenital myopathies and other congenital muscle disorders\u2019 (MG82). They are classified by predominant age of onset (infantile, juvenile, adult), pattern of muscle involvement (anterior tibial vs posterior calf), and inheritance pattern (autosomal dominant vs recessive) (5). Historically, Walton first described distal myopathies in 1982, and subsequent classification by Myoshi et al. (1986) and Nonaka et al. (1981) delineated posterior calf and anterior tibial forms, respectively (6,7). The current nosology places Miyoshi myopathy (distal myopathy 1B; DYSF) as separate from Nonaka myopathy (distal myopathy 2; GNE), and group members include Miyoshi myopathy, Welander distal myopathy (TWN), and Laing early-onset distal myopathy (TTN) among others. Embryologically, DYSF is expressed in late myotube formation during primary myogenesis, explaining the juvenile onset seen in dysferlinopathies. Neuroanatomically, the posterior calf muscles (gastrocnemius, soleus) derive innervation from the tibial nerve roots L5\u2013S2. Differential diagnoses include inclusion body myositis, Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease, and peripheral neuropathies; distinguishing features include elevated CK, pattern of weakness, biopsy findings, and genetic testing. Understanding the molecular genetics of DYSF\u2014a 237 kb gene on chromosome 2p13 encoding a 237 kDa membrane protein involved in sarcolemmal repair\u2014is essential for conceptualizing the disease phenotype. Related disorders: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) shares the same molecular defect but presents with proximal weakness. Taxonomic evolution from initial clinicopathologic descriptions to gene\u2010based nosology highlights the transition from morphologic to molecular classification in neuromuscular disease.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, dysferlin, a transmembrane protein highly expressed in skeletal muscle, mediates calcium-dependent sarcolemmal repair by facilitating membrane patch formation at sites of microinjury incurred during muscle contraction (8). Upon membrane disruption, dysferlin binds to annexins and SNARE proteins, promoting vesicle fusion and resealing. In Miyoshi myopathy, biallelic DYSF mutations lead to absent or dysfunctional dysferlin, impairing this repair mechanism. As a result, repeated contraction-induced microlesions accumulate, leading to chronic myofiber necrosis, inflammatory infiltration, and endomysial fibrosis (9). At the molecular level, defective dysferlin triggers upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and activation of NF-\u03baB pathways, promoting further myofiber damage. Autophagic pathways are secondarily activated but insufficient to clear damaged fibers, resulting in myodegeneration. The selective vulnerability of posterior calf muscles may relate to high mechanical stress and predominance of type II fibers in gastrocnemius, which rely heavily on intact membrane repair. Over time, compensatory satellite cell activation is exhausted, leading to replacement of muscle with fat and connective tissue (pseudohypertrophy in some cases). Comparing to other options: In GNE myopathy, pathophysiology involves sialic acid deficiency leading to rimmed vacuoles and accumulation of misfolded proteins; in nemaline myopathy, structural thin filament defects impede sarcomere function without primary membrane repair failure. Animal models (SJL dysferlin\u2010deficient mice) recapitulate the human phenotype, demonstrating elevated CK, muscle degeneration, and impaired membrane resealing assays, confirming the central role of dysferlin in membrane repair (10).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with Miyoshi myopathy typically present between ages 15 and 30 with difficulty rising on tiptoes, ankle instability, and frequent falls. Cardinal features include symmetric distal weakness and atrophy of gastrocnemius\u2013soleus complex, often sparing anterior compartment until late. Serum CK is markedly elevated (2,000\u201320,000 IU/L; mean ~7,000 IU/L). EMG shows myopathic motor unit potentials with early recruitment, fibrillation potentials, and positive sharp waves. Muscle MRI classically demonstrates fatty infiltration of the medial gastrocnemius and sparing of soleus\u2019s deep regions early in disease (11). Disease progression occurs over 10\u201320 years, with eventual involvement of proximal muscles and loss of ambulation in the third to fourth decade in ~40% of patients. Variants include pseudometabolic presentation with exercise intolerance, and overlap with LGMD2B when proximal weakness predominates. Natural history studies show a 5-year decline in the 6MWT of ~15% and ankle plantarflexion strength reduction of 30% (12). Respiratory and cardiac muscles are typically spared. Current diagnostic criteria (European Neuromuscular Centre 2018) require clinical phenotype, absent dysferlin staining on immunohistochemistry, and confirmation by DYSF gene sequencing (sensitivity 98%, specificity 99%) (13). Pediatric presentations are rare; most cases manifest post\u2010puberty. Immunocompromised patients have similar course but may exhibit more inflammatory features on biopsy. Rare infantile forms with early proximal and distal involvement have been reported (<5% of cases).","diagnostic_approach":"A tiered diagnostic approach is recommended. First-tier: comprehensive history and exam, serum CK, EMG. Early CK elevation (>1,000 IU/L) with myopathic EMG directs toward muscle biopsy. Second-tier: muscle MRI to delineate pattern\u2014selective posterior calf involvement. Third-tier: muscle biopsy with dysferlin immunohistochemistry and Western blot (sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%) (13). Genetic testing of DYSF gene (next-generation sequencing panels or Sanger sequencing) confirms diagnosis (biallelic pathogenic variants). Pretest probability in a young adult with distal calf weakness and CK >2,000 IU/L is ~70%; post-test likelihood after positive dysferlin immunostaining is >99% (PPV 0.99; NPV 0.98) (14). Alternative diagnoses (GNE myopathy, nemaline myopathy, inclusion body myositis) are excluded by absence of rimmed vacuoles, normal thin filament gene sequencing, and clinical pattern. Historic tests (serum lactate, muscle enzyme electrophoresis) are no longer recommended. In resource-limited settings, combination of characteristic clinical pattern and elevated CK may suffice for presumptive diagnosis, with confirmatory testing performed when available. Future diagnostics include serum exosomal dysferlin quantification and in vivo membrane\u2010repair assays under development.","management_principles":"There is no disease-modifying therapy for Miyoshi myopathy. Management focuses on symptom control, maintaining ambulation, and preventing complications. Physical therapy emphasizes low-impact strengthening of proximal muscle groups, stretching to prevent contractures, and gait training. Ankle\u2013foot orthoses may alleviate plantarflexion weakness. Pain management includes NSAIDs for myalgias. Emerging gene therapies targeting DYSF and myostatin inhibitors (e.g., bimagrumab) are under clinical trials (Phase II data show modest improvement in muscle volume but not yet functional endpoints) (15). Cardiac and respiratory monitoring is advised annually despite low risk of involvement. Patients should receive genetic counseling and carrier testing for family planning. No pharmacologic agent (corticosteroids, immunosuppressants) has shown benefit; immunosuppression may worsen muscle degeneration based on small case series. Supportive treatments: nutrition optimization, vitamin D supplementation, psychosocial support. Referral to a multidisciplinary neuromuscular center is recommended (AAN Class II evidence). Novel cell\u2010based therapies (mesoangioblasts) are in preclinical stages.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months with assessments including manual muscle testing (MMT), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), timed up-and-go, and pulmonary function tests (FVC). CK levels may be trended but do not correlate with clinical progression. MRI-based fat fraction quantification can serve as a biomarker in longitudinal studies. Cardiac evaluation (ECG, echocardiogram) annually given rare arrhythmias. Bone density screening every 2 years to monitor for disuse osteoporosis. Monitor for falls, foot ulcers, and joint contractures. Rehabilitation specialists should reassess orthotic needs annually. Transition planning for adult care and vocational evaluation should begin in late adolescence. Patient and family should be educated on signs of overuse injury and instructed in energy conservation techniques. Annual genetic counseling updates recommended as new therapies emerge.","clinical_pearls":"1. Posterior Calf Phenotype: Marked weakness of gastrocnemius with early ankle plantarflexion deficit is pathognomonic for Miyoshi myopathy; mnemonic \u201cGAS-P\u201d (Gastrocnemius Atrophy Selects Plantarflexion).\n2. CK Paradox: Serum CK often >5,000 IU/L despite relatively preserved function; distinguishes dysferlinopathies from inflammatory myopathies where CK may fluctuate.\n3. Dysferlinopathy Spectrum: LGMD2B (proximal) and Miyoshi (distal) share DYSF mutations; phenotype often overlaps\u2014always test DYSF in both patterns.\n4. Biopsy Pitfall: Inflammatory infiltrates in dysferlinopathy may mimic polymyositis\u2014absence of dysferlin on immunostaining is key to prevent misguided immunosuppression.\n5. Genetic Confirmation: Muscle biopsy alone is insufficient; definitive diagnosis requires biallelic DYSF pathogenic variants\u2014necessary for future gene therapy eligibility.","references":"1.
