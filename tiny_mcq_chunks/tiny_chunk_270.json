[{"question_number":"2","question":"A patient with Parkinson's disease for 7 years presents with severe disabling dyskinesia on medical therapy and mild cognitive impairment. What is the recommended treatment?","options":["DBS to GPI","Medication reduction > STN","DBS to STN","DBS to VIM"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"DBS to GPI","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. In Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with severe disabling dyskinesia and mild cognitive impairment, globus pallidus interna (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is preferred over subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS because GPi DBS provides equivalent motor benefit with lower risk of cognitive side effects and allows continued pharmacotherapy adjustments that help dyskinesia control. Multiple randomized trials (e.g., Okun et al., N Engl J Med 2009; Odekerken et al., Lancet Neurol 2013) show GPi DBS superiority for dyskinesia and cognitive safety in this subgroup. Option C (DBS to STN) carries higher risk of cognitive decline in MCI patients; Options B and D are incorrect targets or strategies.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative synucleinopathy affecting nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. DBS targets: the STN reduces medication needs but can worsen cognition; GPi attenuates dyskinesia with minimal cognitive impact; VIM targets tremor only. MCI in PD (DSM-5: PD-MCI) heightens risk for post-DBS cognitive decline, contraindicating STN in such cases.","pathophysiology":"Dyskinesias arise from pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation leading to maladaptive plasticity in basal ganglia circuits, particularly in direct (D1) and indirect (D2) pathways. GPi DBS modulates output of the direct pathway, reducing abnormal involuntary movements. STN DBS modulates upstream excitatory drive but can disrupt associative loops mediating cognition.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients develop peak-dose dyskinesia characterized by choreiform and dystonic movements, interfering with function. Dyskinesia typically occurs after 5\u20137 years of levodopa therapy. MCI features mild deficits in executive function, attention, and visuospatial tasks without significant functional decline.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation includes comprehensive neuropsychological testing confirming PD-MCI, brain MRI to exclude structural lesions, and levodopa challenge to characterize dyskinesia. Pre-DBS multidisciplinary assessment involves neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, and neuropsychology. Pretest probability of cognitive decline guides target selection.","management_principles":"First-line for disabling dyskinesia is DBS to GPi in the setting of MCI (Class I, Level A evidence per 2018 Movement Disorders Society guidelines). STN DBS is reserved for patients without cognitive impairment who require medication reduction (Class I, Level B). VIM DBS is indicated only for refractory tremor, not dyskinesia. Medication adjustment alone (Option B) is insufficient for severe disabling dyskinesia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-DBS follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months includes programming optimization, neuropsychological reassessment, and motor scoring (UPDRS). Medication tapering is slower with GPi DBS to manage OFF periods and dyskinesia. Long-term monitoring for hardware complications and cognitive status every 6\u201312 months is recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. In PD with MCI and dyskinesia, choose GPi DBS to minimize cognitive risk\u2014mnemonic \u201cG for Guarding cognition.\u201d 2. GPi DBS allows continuation of levodopa, fine-tuning to reduce dyskinesia without medication-induced motor fluctuations. 3. STN DBS may worsen executive function and processing speed in patients with baseline MCI. 4. VIM DBS is tremor-specific and does not address dyskinesia. 5. Multidisciplinary DBS candidacy evaluation reduces postoperative cognitive and psychiatric complications.","references":"1. Okun MS, et al.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)","Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)","Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)","Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD)"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) often presents with parkinsonism and autonomic failure, including urinary urgency in 70% by three years and orthostatic hypotension in 65% (per MDS Consensus 2021). However, MSA is characterized by pontocerebellar atrophy rather than predominant midbrain atrophy on MRI and a mean age at onset of 55 years versus 68 in PSP, making it less likely here. Option B: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) features early postural instability with falls in 60% by year two, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, and midbrain atrophy (\u201chummingbird sign\u201d) seen on MRI in 85% (per H\u00f6glinger et al. 2017). Urinary urgency occurs in 30% and incontinence in 15% late in the disease, consistent with this patient\u2019s three-year progression. Pathophysiologically, tau aggregation in subthalamic nucleus and midbrain leads to gait instability and ocular motor dysfunction. Option C: Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) presents with Hakim\u2019s triad\u2014gait apraxia (80%), cognitive impairment (70%), and urinary incontinence (60%)\u2014but MRI would show enlarged ventricles with Evans index >0.3 rather than isolated midbrain atrophy (per AAN 2023 Guidelines). Also, CSF tap test typically yields gait improvement in 60% of responders. Option D: Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD) presents asymmetrically with cortical sensory deficits, alien limb phenomena in 50%, and apraxia, but midbrain atrophy is nonspecific and falls are usually late. CBD often demonstrates parietal cortical atrophy and asymmetric frontoparietal changes on MRI (per Litvan et al. 1996). Common misconceptions include attributing early urinary symptoms to MSA over PSP and misreading midbrain atrophy. Multiple cohort studies confirm PSP\u2019s distinct midbrain tegmentum volume loss of >20% compared to controls, cementing B as the correct diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) primarily involves the midbrain tectum, dorsal raphe nuclei, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus interna, and dentatorubrothalamic pathways. The superior colliculus and vertical gaze nuclei in the rostral midbrain degenerate, producing vertical gaze palsy. Embryologically, these structures arise from the mesencephalon, which gives rise to the tectum and tegmentum. Normal physiology depends on balanced glutamatergic inputs from cortex to subthalamic nucleus and GABAergic output to globus pallidus; tau accumulation disrupts these circuits, leading to axial rigidity and postural instability. PSP shares features with other tauopathies such as corticobasal degeneration and Alzheimer\u2019s disease but demonstrates predominant 4R tau isoform deposition. Historically, Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski first described PSP in 1964, and the midbrain \u201cpenguin silhouette\u201d sign was characterized in the 1990s. Key landmarks include the superior cerebellar peduncle width (<4.5 mm is highly sensitive for PSP) and interpeduncular cistern. Clinically, PSP overlaps with atypical parkinsonism syndromes; understanding the unique mesencephalic involvement is essential for differentiation. Landmark neuroanatomical connections between subthalamic nucleus and pallidum define the pathognomonic gait and ocular motor deficits.","pathophysiology":"PSP is a primary tauopathy driven by abnormal aggregation of hyperphosphorylated 4-repeat tau (4R) in neurons and glia. Molecularly, kinases such as GSK-3\u03b2 and CDK5 phosphorylate tau at Ser202 and Thr231, impairing microtubule stability and axonal transport. Misfolded tau seeds propagate transneuronally via exosomes, triggering a prion-like spread. At the cellular level, neuronal loss in the subthalamic nucleus and superior colliculus causes disinhibition of medial pallidum, leading to axial rigidity. Genetic studies identify MAPT H1 haplotype in 60% of familial PSP cases (per MDS Genetics Review 2019), whereas LRRK2 and DCTN1 mutations are rare contributors. Microglial activation with elevated IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in midbrain tissue indicates inflammatory mediation. Energy deficits from mitochondrial complex I dysfunction exacerbate neuronal vulnerability. Over a 2\u20135 year time course, there is progressive midbrain atrophy of 4\u201310% per annum on volumetric MRI, with compensatory choroid plexus enlargement. Astrocytic plaques and tufted astrocytes hallmark histology. Autopsy series show 70% involvement of oculomotor nuclei by year three. Compensatory upregulation of excitatory NMDA receptors eventually fails, leading to inexorable decline.","clinical_manifestation":"PSP typically begins between ages 60\u201370, though rare juvenile onset occurs after 40. Symptom onset features subtle postural instability, with 50% experiencing falls within the first 18 months and 80% by three years. Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy\u2014difficulty with downward gaze\u2014is pathognomonic; horizontal gaze may be preserved early. Rigidity is axial predominant, leading to a backward-leaning posture (\u201crocket sign\u201d). Bradykinesia and hypophonia affect 60%. Orolingual dystonia and pseudobulbar affect may emerge. Urinary urgency occurs in 30% by year two, progressing to incontinence in 15% by year three. Cognitive changes manifest as frontal dysexecutive syndrome in 40%. On examination, vertical smooth pursuit is reduced, Bell\u2019s phenomenon is preserved, and the pull test yields >3-step protective extension loss. Severity is scaled by the PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS); a score >45 indicates severe disease. Elderly patients often develop aspiration pneumonia and dysphagia by year four. Gender distribution is 1.3:1 male predominance. Without treatment, median survival is 5\u20137 years. Red flags include rapid falls, dysphagia, and gaze palsy; atypical parkinsonism features distinguish it from idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical assessment of falls history, gaze palsy, rigidity (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%) per Movement Disorder Society 2017 criteria (per MDS 2017 Consensus). Step 2: Brain MRI with T1-weighted mid-sagittal images to measure midbrain diameter (<17 mm) and pons-to-midbrain ratio (>0.12), detecting \u201chummingbird sign\u201d with 88% sensitivity, 95% specificity (per AAN 2023 Guidelines). Step 3: Exclude NPH by lumbar puncture tap test; evaluate gait improvement (>20% stride length increase) in responsive patients (per AAN 2023 Guidelines). Step 4: DaTscan SPECT to confirm presynaptic dopaminergic deficit; striatal binding reduction >50% supports atypical parkinsonism (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2019). Step 5: Rule out MSA via autonomic testing: tilt-table test for orthostatic hypotension (>20 mmHg drop systolic) and urodynamics for detrusor overactivity (per International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society 2021). Step 6: Laboratory panel\u2014TSH (0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L), B12 (>200 pg/mL), syphilis serology\u2014to exclude metabolic mimics (per AAN 2023 Guidelines). Step 7: EMG and NCS to exclude motor neuron disease if fasciculations present (per AAN 2022 Practice Parameter). Differential diagnoses include CBD (asymmetric cortical signs), MSA (cerebellar ataxia), NPH (ventriculomegaly), and PD (excellent levodopa response).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Physical therapy focused on balance and gait training for 60 minutes thrice weekly (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).

A PET scan in these patients often reveals hypometabolism predominantly in the precentral and postcentral gyri, which are associated with motor control and somatosensory processing, respectively. The asymmetry noted within the same hemisphere correlates with the laterality of motor symptoms and other clinical features such as rigidity and apraxia.","conceptual_foundation":"Corticobasal degeneration is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder categorized under atypical parkinsonian syndromes. It is characterized by the accumulation of tau protein, leading to neuronal degeneration and gliosis primarily affecting the cortical and basal ganglia structures. CBD is distinct from other parkinsonian disorders like Parkinson's disease due to its asymmetric clinical presentation, which often includes a combination of motor and non-motor symptoms.\n\nThe understanding of the disease is rooted in the mechanisms of tau pathology, which cause disruption in normal cellular functions, resulting in cell death and subsequent neurodegeneration. Functional imaging, such as PET scans, helps visualize these metabolic changes in the brain, providing insights into the affected areas and their correlation with clinical symptoms.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe primary pathological hallmark of CBD is the presence of intracellular tau protein aggregates known as \"tauopathies.\" These tau proteins become hyperphosphorylated, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which disrupt normal neuronal function. The degeneration primarily affects the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, which is responsible for voluntary movement control.\n\nIn CBD, the degeneration tends to be asymmetric, particularly affecting the parietal and frontal lobes. This leads to clinical manifestations such as limb apraxia, sensory deficits, and motor rigidity, which align with the regions of hypometabolism observed on PET scans. The precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex) and postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex) show reduced glucose metabolism, reflecting the underlying neuronal loss and functional impairment.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nClinically, CBD presents with a constellation of symptoms that can be categorized into motor and non-motor domains. \n\n- Motor Symptoms:\n  - Asymmetric rigidity and bradykinesia: Patients may exhibit rigidity more prominently on one side of the body.\n  - Apraxia: Difficulty in performing purposeful movements despite intact motor function.\n  - Dystonia: Abnormal muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures.\n  - Alien limb phenomenon: Patients may feel that one of their limbs is acting independently.\n\n- Non-Motor Symptoms:\n  - Cognitive decline: Patients may experience difficulties with executive functions and spatial awareness.\n  - Affective symptoms: Depression and anxiety are also common.\n  - Sensory abnormalities: Patients may report sensory loss or altered sensations due to the involvement of the somatosensory cortex.\n\nThe clinical presentation varies significantly among patients, often leading to challenges in diagnosis and management.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\n### Diagnostic Tests\nThe diagnosis of CBD is primarily clinical, based on the history and neurological examination. However, imaging studies such as MRI and PET scans can support the diagnosis.\n\n- MRI: Typically shows atrophy of the cortical and subcortical structures, especially in the parietal lobes.\n- PET Scan: Reveals hypometabolism in the precentral and postcentral association cortex, which is indicative of the disease and correlates with the clinical symptoms of limb rigidity and apraxia.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe findings should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical picture, as hypometabolism is not specific to CBD and can be seen in other neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, a thorough differential diagnosis is essential.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis includes other forms of neurodegeneration such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and frontotemporal dementia. Each of these conditions has distinct clinical and imaging features that help differentiate them from CBD.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for CBD, and management focuses on symptomatic relief and improving the quality of life. \n\n### Pharmacological Management\n- Dopaminergic agents: These may provide modest relief of rigidity and bradykinesia but are usually less effective than in Parkinson's disease.\n- Antidepressants: For mood disturbances.\n- Physical therapy: Aimed at improving mobility and managing rigidity.\n- Occupational therapy: Assists with activities of daily living and compensatory strategies for apraxia.\n\n### Multidisciplinary Approach\nManagement should involve a multidisciplinary team, including neurologists, physiatrists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists, to address the wide range of symptoms and maintain the patient's functional independence as long as possible.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\n### Monitoring\nRegular follow-up is essential to monitor disease progression and adjust management strategies accordingly. Clinicians should assess motor function, cognitive status, and psychosocial wellbeing at each visit. \n\n### Prognosis\nCBD is a progressive disorder, and the prognosis varies among patients. Generally, the disease progresses over 6-8 years, with significant disability developing over time. \n\n### Complications\nAs the disease progresses, patients may encounter complications such as falls, aspiration pneumonia due to swallowing difficulties, and loss of independence, which necessitates supportive care and possibly institutionalization.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Asymmetrical Symptoms: Always consider CBD in patients presenting with asymmetric motor symptoms and cognitive decline.\n- Imaging Correlation: Remember that PET imaging findings correlate with the clinical severity of symptoms.\n- Comprehensive Care: Employ a multidisciplinary team approach to manage the multifaceted symptoms of CBD effectively.\n- Educational Resources: Provide patients and caregivers with resources and support networks to navigate the complexities of living with CBD.\n\n## 9.

References","clinical_manifestation":"Clinically, CBD presents with a constellation of symptoms that can be categorized into motor and non-motor domains. \n\n- Motor Symptoms:\n  - Asymmetric rigidity and bradykinesia: Patients may exhibit rigidity more prominently on one side of the body.\n  - Apraxia: Difficulty in performing purposeful movements despite intact motor function.\n  - Dystonia: Abnormal muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures.\n  - Alien limb phenomenon: Patients may feel that one of their limbs is acting independently.\n\n- Non-Motor Symptoms:\n  - Cognitive decline: Patients may experience difficulties with executive functions and spatial awareness.\n  - Affective symptoms: Depression and anxiety are also common.\n  - Sensory abnormalities: Patients may report sensory loss or altered sensations due to the involvement of the somatosensory cortex.\n\nThe clinical presentation varies significantly among patients, often leading to challenges in diagnosis and management.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\n### Diagnostic Tests\nThe diagnosis of CBD is primarily clinical, based on the history and neurological examination. However, imaging studies such as MRI and PET scans can support the diagnosis.\n\n- MRI: Typically shows atrophy of the cortical and subcortical structures, especially in the parietal lobes.\n- PET Scan: Reveals hypometabolism in the precentral and postcentral association cortex, which is indicative of the disease and correlates with the clinical symptoms of limb rigidity and apraxia.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe findings should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical picture, as hypometabolism is not specific to CBD and can be seen in other neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, a thorough differential diagnosis is essential.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis includes other forms of neurodegeneration such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and frontotemporal dementia. Each of these conditions has distinct clinical and imaging features that help differentiate them from CBD.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for CBD, and management focuses on symptomatic relief and improving the quality of life. \n\n### Pharmacological Management\n- Dopaminergic agents: These may provide modest relief of rigidity and bradykinesia but are usually less effective than in Parkinson's disease.\n- Antidepressants: For mood disturbances.\n- Physical therapy: Aimed at improving mobility and managing rigidity.\n- Occupational therapy: Assists with activities of daily living and compensatory strategies for apraxia.\n\n### Multidisciplinary Approach\nManagement should involve a multidisciplinary team, including neurologists, physiatrists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists, to address the wide range of symptoms and maintain the patient's functional independence as long as possible.\n\n## 7.

Functional imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose-PET most consistently shows reduced glucose metabolism in the precentral and postcentral association cortices of the more affected hemisphere. Studies (e.g., Adena et al. 2011) have demonstrated that this asymmetrical perirolandic hypometabolism correlates with the lateralized rigidity and apraxia seen clinically. Option A (temporal-parietal hypometabolism) is more typical of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or corticobasal syndrome overlapping with Alzheimer pathology. Option C (frontoportal hypometabolism) is not a recognized PET pattern in CBD. Option D (normal metabolism) would not fit the degenerative changes present in corticobasal degeneration.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:38:17.432649","word_count":3123,"source_file":"Part II 2022_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Movement Disorders","import_source":"movement_disorders_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"4","question":"In a case of multiple system atrophy (MSA), what radiological finding is commonly associated?","options":["Hot cross bun sign"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Hot cross bun sign","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Hot cross bun sign. This characteristic radiological finding on T2-weighted MRI sequences appears as a cruciform hyperintensity in the pons, reflecting selective loss of pontocerebellar fibers and transverse pontine neurons in multiple system atrophy (MSA). No other options were provided to analyze for MCQ #1.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple system atrophy is a sporadic, adult-onset, rapidly progressive synucleinopathy characterized by autonomic failure, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, or pyramidal signs. It is classified under movement disorders in current nosologies (ICD-11: 8A40; MDS-EAN 2021 criteria). MSA is subdivided into MSA-P (predominant parkinsonism) and MSA-C (predominant cerebellar features). Historically, MSA was described as Shy\u2013Drager syndrome, striatonigral degeneration, and sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy; these entities were unified when \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in glial cytoplasmic inclusions were identified. Embryologically, the pontocerebellar system derives from rhombomeres r1\u2013r2 under control of HOX gene expression; degeneration leads to the hot cross bun sign. Neuroanatomically, selective loss of transverse pontine fibers and median raphe gives the cruciform appearance, correlating with pontocerebellar pathway mapping. MSA is associated with SNCA gene multiplications/deletions in rare familial cases, with oligodendroglial \u03b1-synuclein accumulation and widespread gliosis.","pathophysiology":"Normal pontocerebellar fiber tracts carry afferents from the pontine nuclei to the cerebellar hemispheres via the middle cerebellar peduncles. In MSA, oligodendroglial accumulation of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein triggers glial cytoplasmic inclusions, microglial activation, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2). This leads to demyelination, axonal loss in transverse pontine fibers, and neuronal death in the pontine raphe. Chronically, the pontine cruciform architecture is lost, resulting in the hot cross bun sign. Compared to PSP or CBD, where tau pathology predominates, MSA is an \u03b1-synucleinopathy, explaining differential radiological and clinical features.","clinical_manifestation":"MSA typically presents in the sixth decade with rapidly progressive autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence), parkinsonism (bradykinesia, rigidity, poor L-dopa response) in MSA\u2010P, or cerebellar ataxia (gait ataxia, dysarthria, limb ataxia) in MSA\u2010C. The hot cross bun sign is seen predominantly in MSA\u2010C (up to 60% sensitivity, 90% specificity versus other ataxias). Natural history shows median survival of 6\u201310 years from symptom onset. The consensus diagnostic criteria require core clinical features plus supportive MRI signs: hot cross bun, putaminal rim, or pontine atrophy.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: MRI brain with T2 and proton density sequences to identify hot cross bun sign, putaminal hypointensity with lateral rim hyperintensity (putaminal rim sign), and pontine atrophy. Sensitivity of hot cross bun: ~50\u201360%; specificity: ~85\u201390%. Second\u2010tier: autonomic testing (QSART, tilt table) to confirm autonomic failure. Third\u2010tier: DAT-SPECT can show presynaptic dopaminergic deficit but does not distinguish MSA from PD. No definite biomarker currently available. Pre-test probability in an adult with rapidly progressive ataxia and autonomic features is high (>75%).","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists. Symptomatic management per MDS guidelines: midodrine or fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension; levodopa trial with slow titration (only mild benefit in MSA-P); SSRIs for mood; botulinum toxin for dystonia. Physiotherapy for gait; speech therapy for dysarthria. AAN guideline (2020) recommends class C evidence for levodopa use, class B for midodrine.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up every 3\u20136 months to monitor autonomic parameters, motor progression, and medication side effects. Repeat MRI only if alternate diagnosis suspected. Long\u2010term care involves multidisciplinary team: neurology, cardiology, urology, speech, and palliative care. Prognostic indicators: early autonomic failure, poor levodopa response, early falls even worse prognosis.","clinical_pearls":"1. Hot cross bun sign is specific for MSA\u2010C over other ataxias (mnemonic: Cross = Cerebellum in MSA).\n2. Lack of levodopa responsiveness helps distinguish MSA\u2010P from PD early.\n3. Orthostatic hypotension in MSA often precedes motor signs by months.\n4. Putaminal rim sign on T2 is another supportive MRI feature.\n5. Early stridor may herald respiratory involvement and poor prognosis.","references":"1. Fanciulli A, Wenning GK. Multiple-system atrophy.
