Upon performing a lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which test should you consider sending?","options":["Nocardia test","HSV test","Cryptococcus antigen test","TB test"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Nocardia test","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Nocardia test. In HIV patients with multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions on CT or MRI, the differential includes Toxoplasma gondii, primary CNS lymphoma, tuberculosis (tuberculomas), cryptococcomas, and Nocardia brain abscesses. While Toxoplasma is most common, Nocardia must be considered in patients with severe immunosuppression (CD4 <100/\u03bcL). Nocardia asteroides complex causes pulmonary disease that can hematogenously seed the brain, producing multiple abscesses. CSF Gram stain with modified acid-fast stain (Kinyoun) and culture for Nocardia has high specificity (\u2248100%) though sensitivity is low (\u224820\u201330%).\n\nOption B (HSV test) is incorrect because HSV encephalitis typically causes temporal lobe necrosis rather than discrete abscesses. PCR sensitivity in CSF for HSV is >95% with high negative predictive value, but imaging pattern differs (hemorrhagic necrosis, edema).\n\nOption C (Cryptococcus antigen test) is incorrect as Cryptococcus neoformans causes meningoencephalitis with elevated opening pressure and CSF India ink positivity; imaging may show dilated Virchow\u2013Robin spaces or cryptococcomas but rarely presents as multiple ring-enhancing masses in HIV.\n\nOption D (TB test) is less likely in this scenario: tuberculomas occur but are usually solitary or few, with CSF showing lymphocytic pleocytosis, low glucose, and elevated protein. CSF AFB smear sensitivity is <10%, culture sensitivity ~50% but the imaging pattern and CSF profile differ.\n\nA Nocardia test on CSF (Gram stain with modified acid-fast stain plus culture) directly targets the organism causing abscess formation, guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy (e.g., high-dose TMP-SMX).","conceptual_foundation":"In HIV-infected individuals, opportunistic CNS infections arise when CD4+ T-cell counts fall below 200/\u03bcL. The key pathogens include Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, JC virus, CMV, and Nocardia asteroides. Imaging patterns assist differentiation: \n\n\u2022 Toxoplasma: multiple ring-enhancing lesions >2 cm, basal ganglia predilection, edema\n\u2022 Nocardia: multiple brain abscesses, ring-enhancing, often with pulmonary nodules or consolidation\n\u2022 TB: tuberculomas (solid/semi-solid lesions), meningeal enhancement\n\u2022 Cryptococcus: meningeal enhancement, dilated perivascular spaces, rarely mass lesions\n\nNocardiosis is caused by aerobic, branching filamentous, weakly acid-fast Gram-positive bacteria. Taxonomically, it belongs to the order Actinomycetales; N. asteroides complex is most neurotropic. The organism enters via inhalation into lungs, then hematogenous dissemination to the CNS. \n\nIn ICD-11, cerebral nocardiosis is coded under 1F21.1 (Nocardial brain abscess). Historically, Nocardia was first described in 1888 by Trevisan. Prior to modern imaging, diagnosis relied on postmortem findings. Modern Kinyoun stain and radiographic techniques have improved detection.","pathophysiology":"Normal host defense against Nocardia requires intact cell-mediated immunity, especially CD4+ T-cells producing interferon-\u03b3, which activates macrophages to kill intracellular organisms. In HIV, low CD4+ counts impair this pathway.\n\nNocardia enters pulmonary alveoli, resists phagolysosomal killing by catalase and superoxide dismutase, then invades bloodstream. In the CNS, it forms microabscesses that coalesce into larger abscess cavities lined by granulation tissue. The abscess wall produces ring enhancement on imaging due to neovascularization and disrupted blood\u2013brain barrier. \n\nOn a molecular level, Nocardia produces cord factor and trehalose dimycolate, inducing TNF-\u03b1 release and granuloma formation. Inadequate containment leads to abscess rupture and edema, causing neurologic deficits and confusion. The host inflammatory response contributes to mass effect. \n\nBy contrast, HSV uses neural spread via olfactory pathways, causing necrotizing encephalitis without well-formed abscesses; Cryptococcus crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier via transcytosis, causing meningoencephalitis; TB forms caseating granulomas with central necrosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Nocardial brain abscess presents subacutely over days to weeks with headache (60\u201380%), focal neurologic deficits (50\u201370%), seizures (20\u201340%), and altered mental status (20\u201330%) in immunocompromised patients. Fever is less common (\u224830%). Risk factors include chronic lung disease, corticosteroid use, and CD4+ <100/\u03bcL. \n\nOn exam, focal signs reflect abscess location (e.g., hemiparesis). Elevated intracranial pressure may cause papilledema, nausea/vomiting. Chest imaging often reveals nodular infiltrates or cavitary lesions in \u224840\u201360% of cases. \n\nUntreated, nocardial abscesses expand, leading to herniation and death. With therapy, mortality falls from ~70% to ~20%\u201330%. Early neurosurgical drainage improves outcomes. \n\nCSF findings are frequently nonspecific: mild pleocytosis (10\u2013200 cells/mm3), elevated protein (100\u2013500 mg/dL), and normal-to-low glucose. Direct detection in CSF is low yield; brain biopsy yields the highest diagnostic sensitivity (~80%).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Neuroimaging with contrast-enhanced MRI (sensitivity ~95% for abscess detection). In HIV, CT with contrast if MRI unavailable. Identify multiple ring-enhancing lesions. \n\nSecond-tier: Chest imaging (CXR or CT) to identify pulmonary nocardiosis. \n\nThird-tier: Stereotactic brain biopsy for histopathology, Gram stain, modified acid-fast stain (Kinyoun), and culture. CSF modified acid-fast stain and culture have sensitivity ~20% but should be sent if LP performed (Grade CIII AAN guideline 2015). PCR assays for Nocardia species are emerging in reference labs.\n\nCSF cryptococcal antigen (sensitivity >95%) and TB PCR (GeneXpert; sensitivity ~60%) should also be considered based on clinical suspicion.","management_principles":"First-line therapy: High-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) IV (15 mg/kg TMP component daily in divided doses) for at least 6 weeks, followed by oral therapy for 6\u201312 months. Neurosurgical aspiration or excision recommended for abscesses >2.5 cm or mass effect (Class IIa, Level B). \n\nSecond-line: Add imipenem or amikacin for severe disease or TMP-SMX intolerance (Level C). \n\nMonitor renal function and blood counts bi-weekly initially. Adjust doses in renal impairment. In transplant/HIV patients, continue secondary prophylaxis with low-dose TMP-SMX until immune reconstitution (CD4+ >200/\u03bcL for >6 months).","follow_up_guidelines":"Neuroimaging at 4\u20136 weeks after treatment initiation to assess abscess resolution; then every 3 months until complete radiographic resolution. Monitor clinical status weekly during hospitalization, then monthly outpatient visits assessing neurologic function and adverse effects. \n\nLaboratory: CBC, renal and liver function tests bi-weekly during induction, then monthly. In HIV patients, monitor CD4+ counts every 3 months. \n\nDuration: Continue therapy until radiographic resolution and CD4+ recovery, typically 12 months. Discontinue secondary prophylaxis once CD4+ >200/\u03bcL for >6 months.","clinical_pearls":"1.

She shows signs of stroke on examination. What is the best diagnostic test?","options":["Blood Culture","Brain CT","Contrast brain CT","Lumbar puncture"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Contrast brain CT","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: Contrast brain CT. In a patient with suspected tuberculous meningitis presenting with systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, back pain) and new focal neurologic deficits suggesting stroke, guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA 2017) and the British Infection Association (2014) strongly recommend neuroimaging with contrast (MRI or CT) prior to lumbar puncture to identify space-occupying lesions or infarcts and reduce risk of herniation. A contrast\u2010enhanced CT scan can detect basal meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, tuberculomas, vasculitic infarcts, and abscesses with reported sensitivity of 85\u201390% for tuberculous meningeal enhancement (Suresh et al., 2019). Noncontrast CT (option B) frequently misses subtle meningeal enhancement and early infarcts; its sensitivity is only around 60% (DOI:10.1093/cid/052012). Blood cultures (option A) may identify disseminated mycobacteria but have poor sensitivity (<50% in focal CNS disease) and take weeks to grow. Lumbar puncture (option D) without prior imaging in the setting of focal deficits risks fatal brain herniation in up to 1\u20133% of cases (AAN 2018). Common pitfalls include overreliance on CSF culture when imaging is paramount and misinterpreting noncontrast CT as sufficient to rule out intracranial lesions.","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is an extrapulmonary manifestation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection characterized by chronic basilar meningeal inflammation leading to cranial nerve palsies, hydrocephalus, and vascular infarcts. It is classified under ICD-11 code 1D49.0 as \u2018Tuberculosis of the central nervous system.\u2019 Differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis (ICD-11 1D40), fungal meningitis (1D59), carcinomatous meningitis (2B80), and neurosarcoidosis. Historically described by Osler in 1895, modern nosology recognizes TBM as the most severe form of CNS tuberculosis given its high mortality (up to 50% untreated) and morbidity (disability in 25\u201330% of survivors). Embryologically, the meningeal layers derive from mesoderm (pia and arachnoid) and neural crest (dura), which become inflamed in TBM leading to basal exudates. Neuroanatomically, inflammation localizes to the basal cisterns, encasing the circle of Willis and perforating vessels, predisposing to endarteritis obliterans and infarction in deep structures (thalamus, internal capsule). The molecular pathogenesis involves granulomatous inflammation mediated by Th1\u2010driven IFN-\u03b3 responses, TNF-\u03b1 release, and caseous necrosis within the subarachnoid space. Key genetic susceptibility loci include variants in TLR2, TLR4, and vitamin D receptor genes, which modulate innate immune response to mycobacterial antigens.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, the meninges and CSF spaces provide mechanical protection and immune surveillance. In TBM, hematogenous seeding or direct extension from vertebral osteomyelitis leads to deposition of bacilli in the subarachnoid space. There they incite a granulomatous inflammatory reaction, producing sticky fibrinous exudates in the basal cisterns. Molecularly, macrophages present mycobacterial antigen via MHC II to CD4+ T cells, triggering a Th1 response with IFN-\u03b3 secretion. IFN-\u03b3 activates macrophages to form epithelioid and Langhans giant cells; excessive TNF-\u03b1 leads to caseation. The exudate encases vessels causing vasculitis and endarteritis, leading to cerebral infarcts in watershed territories. Hydrocephalus arises from CSF flow obstruction at the basal cisterns or arachnoid granulations. Chronically, persistent inflammation results in fibrosis, cranial nerve entrapment, and communicating hydrocephalus. The stroke signs in this patient reflect tubercular vasculitis rather than typical atherosclerotic or cardioembolic strokes. In contrast, bacterial meningitis causes neutrophil\u2010predominant exudates, and viral meningitis has lymphocytic pleocytosis without granulomas.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with TBM typically present subacutely over 1\u20134 weeks. Early prodromes include low\u2010grade fever (85\u201390%), malaise, anorexia, weight loss, and night sweats. Back pain and vertebral involvement (Pott\u2019s disease) occur in up to 15% of cases. Headache is nearly universal (95%), followed by neck stiffness (70%) and photophobia (40%). Focal neurologic deficits occur in 30\u201340%, with cranial nerve palsies (VI > III) due to basal exudates. Stroke occurs in 15\u201325%, most often in the basal ganglia and internal capsule. Seizures are seen in 20\u201330%, and altered mental status in advanced stages. Untreated, TBM progresses to coma within 2\u20135 weeks, with mortality rates >50%. Diagnostic criteria per Marais et al. (2010) include CSF glucose <2.2 mmol/L, protein >1 g/L, lymphocytic pleocytosis >100 cells/mm3, and neuroimaging evidence of basal enhancement or infarcts. In pediatric patients, presentation may be more subtle with irritability and failure to thrive.","diagnostic_approach":"The first step is contrast\u2010enhanced neuroimaging. A CT scan with contrast will show basal meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, and infarcts; sensitivity is 85\u201390% for TB meningitis (Meyer et al., 2015). If CT is unavailable, MRI with gadolinium is preferred (sensitivity >95%) but less accessible in low\u2010resource settings. After excluding mass effect and raised intracranial pressure, a lumbar puncture reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis (100\u2013500 cells/mm3), low glucose (<0.3 CSF/serum ratio), and high protein (>1 g/L). CSF acid\u2010fast bacilli smear has low sensitivity (~20%), but culture (MGIT) and PCR (Xpert MTB/RIF) improve detection (>60% sensitivity, specificity >98%). Pre\u2010test probability is high in endemic areas or with validated clinical scoring systems (Marais score). Number needed to test (NNT) to identify one TBM case in high\u2010burden regions is approximately 4. Second\u2010tier tests include CSF ADA (>10 U/L has 89% sensitivity, 91% specificity) and interferon\u2010\u03b3 release assays (IGRA) in CSF. Third\u2010tier investigations\u2014such as next\u2010generation sequencing of CSF\u2014remain research tools.","management_principles":"Immediate empiric antitubercular therapy is recommended upon suspicion. The standard regimen comprises isoniazid (5 mg/kg/day), rifampin (10 mg/kg/day), pyrazinamide (20\u201330 mg/kg/day), and ethambutol (15\u201325 mg/kg/day) for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for an additional 7\u201310 months (WHO 2020). Adjunctive dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg/day tapered over 6\u20138 weeks) reduces mortality (relative risk reduction 31%; randomized trial by Thwaites et al. 2004). In HIV\u2010coinfected patients, ART should begin 2\u20138 weeks after starting TB therapy. Monitor liver function tests monthly and visual acuity for ethambutol toxicity. In hydrocephalus, consider ventriculoperitoneal shunting. For stroke complications, standard supportive care and rehabilitation are indicated. Second\u2010line agents (fluoroquinolones, linezolid) are reserved for drug\u2010resistant TB or intolerance. Therapeutic drug monitoring may optimize rifampin and isoniazid levels in critical cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up includes clinical assessments at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, then monthly until treatment completion. Repeat contrast CT or MRI at 2 months to assess resolution of meningeal enhancement and detect persistent hydrocephalus or new infarcts. Monitor CSF parameters only if clinical deterioration occurs. Liver function tests should be checked monthly; visual acuity every 2 months. Functional assessment with the Modified Rankin Scale at 6 and 12 months quantifies disability. Long\u2010term sequelae include cognitive impairment (up to 50%), hearing loss (20%), and motor deficits. Relapse rates <5% with full-duration therapy. Rehabilitation should be multidisciplinary, addressing physical, cognitive, and psychosocial needs. Transition from hospital to community care requires coordination with public health TB programs for adherence support and contact tracing.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always perform contrast neuroimaging prior to LP in patients with focal neurologic signs or altered mentation to avoid herniation\u2014key for both TBM and other meningitides. 2.

Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that initiating antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) within 72 hours of rash onset significantly reduces the duration and severity of acute herpes zoster and lowers the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). In the pivotal Wood et al. study (Ann Intern Med 1994;121(2):85\u201390), acyclovir reduced the incidence of PHN at 4 months from 21% in the placebo group to 12% in the treatment group (absolute risk reduction 9%, NNT=11). Meta-analyses (Marin et al., Clin Infect Dis 2008;46(9):1341\u201350) confirm a relative risk reduction of approximately 41% for PHN with early antiviral therapy (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47\u20130.74).\n\nOption B (Steroids): Although adjunctive corticosteroids may accelerate rash healing and improve acute pain, systematic reviews (Dworkin et al., Clin Infect Dis 2007;44 Suppl 1:S1\u201326) indicate no consistent benefit in preventing PHN. Steroid monotherapy does not address viral replication and carries risks of immunosuppression.\n\nOption C (Anticonvulsants): Agents such as gabapentin and pregabalin are first-line for treating established PHN (Level A evidence, Dworkin et al. 2010 guidelines), but there is no evidence they prevent PHN when given during acute zoster.\n\nOption D (Analgesics): Analgesics (NSAIDs, opioids) provide symptomatic relief of acute zoster pain but do not modify viral replication or nerve damage, and thus do not prevent PHN.","conceptual_foundation":"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) remains latent in sensory dorsal root ganglia after primary varicella infection. Reactivation leads to viral replication, inflammation, and necrosis of ganglion cells, manifesting as dermatomal rash and neuropathic pain. PHN represents chronic neuropathic pain persisting beyond 90 days after rash onset, stemming from irreversible damage to peripheral and central nociceptive pathways. Early antiviral therapy reduces viral load and inflammation, limiting neuronal injury. This fits within ICD-11 classification: B02.2 Postherpetic polyneuropathy, and aligns with neuropathic pain categories in IASP taxonomy. Differential diagnoses include diabetic neuropathy, complex regional pain syndrome, and other post-infectious neuropathies.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia conduct nociceptive signals via A\u03b4 and C fibers to the dorsal horn, ascending via spinothalamic tracts. In VZV reactivation, viral replication triggers inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and direct cytopathic effects, causing neuronal apoptosis and demyelination. This leads to ectopic pacemaker activity, reduced inhibitory GABAergic tone in the dorsal horn, and central sensitization. Over weeks to months, Wallerian degeneration and plastic changes in the dorsal horn contribute to persistent pain. Early antivirals inhibit viral thymidine kinase\u2013dependent DNA polymerase, reducing replication and downstream inflammatory cascades, thereby preserving neuronal integrity and reducing PHN risk.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute herpes zoster presents with prodromal dysesthesia, followed by unilateral vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution and severe neuropathic pain. PHN is defined as pain persisting \u226590 days after rash onset, characterized by burning, allodynia, and hyperalgesia.

A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows patchy cortical and cerebellar signal enhancement. What is the best treatment?","options":["Pyrimethamine","Acyclovir","Steroids","Antifungal therapy ## Page 8"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Pyrimethamine","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most correct answer is A. Pyrimethamine. This antiprotozoal agent, combined with sulfadiazine and leucovorin, constitutes the first-line therapy for cerebral toxoplasmosis in HIV patients. Clinical trials and cohort studies have demonstrated over 80% lesion resolution and significant neurological improvement within two weeks of initiating therapy. MRI findings of multiple, ring-enhancing lesions\u2014often in cortical and cerebellar regions\u2014strongly point toward toxoplasmosis. Option B (Acyclovir) is indicated for herpes simplex encephalitis, which typically shows hemorrhagic temporal lobe lesions, not patchy cortical/cerebellar enhancement. Option C (Steroids) may be used adjunctively to reduce mass effect in severe cases but are not primary therapy and can worsen infection if used alone. Option D (Antifungal therapy) targets fungal abscesses or cryptococcal meningitis, which present with different imaging (e.g., meningeal enhancement) and CSF profiles, making it inappropriate here.","conceptual_foundation":"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan. In immunocompetent hosts, cell-mediated immunity controls infection, leading to latent bradyzoite cysts. In HIV/AIDS with CD4+ counts <100 cells/\u00b5L, reactivation occurs, causing cerebral toxoplasmosis (ICD-11 code P30). Key differentials include primary CNS lymphoma (EBV-driven, solitary periventricular mass), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (JC virus, nonenhancing white matter lesions), and cryptococcosis (meningeal enhancement without focal parenchymal lesions). Understanding the parasite life cycle, host immune deficits, and neuroimaging patterns is essential for accurate diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"Normal defense against T. gondii relies on Th1 responses with IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 activating macrophages. HIV-mediated CD4+ T-cell depletion undermines this control, enabling tachyzoite proliferation and host cell lysis. Focal necrosis and granulomatous inflammation ensue, disrupting the blood-brain barrier and causing vasogenic edema. The ring-enhancing lesions on MRI correspond to necrotic centers surrounded by inflamed, contrast-leaky tissue.","clinical_manifestation":"Cerebral toxoplasmosis typically presents subacutely over days to weeks with headache, fever, confusion, and focal neurological deficits in 70\u201390% of cases. Seizures occur in ~30%. Lesions are often multiple (60\u201370%) and located in basal ganglia, corticomedullary junction, and cerebellum. CSF analysis shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein; glucose is usually normal or slightly reduced. Serum Toxoplasma IgG is positive in ~95% but has low specificity in endemic areas.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical and radiographic. Criteria include HIV with CD4+ <100, compatible symptoms, positive Toxoplasma IgG, and characteristic MRI (multiple ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding edema). Empirical therapy is started immediately; brain biopsy is reserved for nonresponders after 2 weeks or atypical imaging. CSF PCR for T. gondii offers specificity >97% but sensitivity of 28\u201367%, and is not required before treatment initiation.","management_principles":"First-line regimen: Pyrimethamine 200 mg loading dose, then 50\u201375 mg daily, plus Sulfadiazine 1\u20131.5 g every 6 hours, and Leucovorin 10\u201325 mg daily for 6 weeks. Then, maintenance therapy until CD4+ >200 cells/\u00b5L for \u22656 months. Monitor CBC for bone marrow suppression and renal/hepatic function. In sulfa allergy, clindamycin replaces sulfadiazine. Adjunctive corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) are reserved for patients with significant mass effect or intracranial hypertension.","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess clinical and radiographic response in 2\u20134 weeks. Repeat MRI at 2 weeks: a \u226550% reduction in lesion size indicates response. Continue maintenance therapy until sustained immune reconstitution (CD4+ >200 cells/\u00b5L for 6 months). Monitor CBC biweekly initially, then monthly. Adjust drug dosing for renal/hepatic impairment. Evaluate for relapse if symptoms recur.","clinical_pearls":"1. Toxoplasma IgG seropositivity in HIV patients with CD4+ <100 exceeds 95%\u2014test early. 2. Multiple ring-enhancing lesions in basal ganglia on MRI have high sensitivity for toxoplasmosis. 3. Empirical therapy yields clinical improvement in ~80% of cases, reducing need for brain biopsy. 4. Pyrimethamine causes dose-dependent bone marrow suppression; coadminister leucovorin. 5. Nonresponse after 2 weeks mandates brain biopsy or consideration of primary CNS lymphoma (check CSF EBV PCR).","references":"1. Berger JR, et al.

He presented with headache and fever. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed elevated WBC (571, monoclonal cells predominant), high protein, and low glucose. Gram stain showed no organism. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his condition?","options":["Plasmodium falciparum","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Listeria monocytogenes"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculous meningitis classically presents with subacute headache, fever, and constitutional symptoms, and CSF analysis reveals lymphocytic (mononuclear) pleocytosis (often 100\u20131,000 cells/mm3), elevated protein (100\u2013500 mg/dL), and low glucose (< 40 mg/dL or CSF/serum glucose ratio < 0.5). Gram stain is typically negative. In contrast, Plasmodium falciparum (option A) causes cerebral malaria characterized by altered consciousness, seizures, and malarial pigment in the cerebral microvasculature, not a chronic lymphocytic meningitis picture. Listeria monocytogenes (option C) can cause meningitis in neonates, elderly, and immunocompromised patients, often with neutrophilic CSF and Gram\u2010positive rods visible on Gram stain. Thus, the CSF profile here strongly supports tuberculous meningitis.","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberculous meningitis is caused by hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the meninges. It is classified in ICD-11 under \u2018A17.0 Tuberculous meningitis\u2019 and corresponds to neuro-infectious disease in neurology. Key prerequisites for understanding include the blood-brain barrier, CSF physiology, and mycobacterial pathogenesis. Historical classification evolved from general bacterial meningitis to specific mycobacterial forms. The organism reaches the subarachnoid space via Rich foci rupture in the meninges or by contiguous spread. The brain and spinal cord\u2019s pia and arachnoid mater are the main sites of infection.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, the meninges and CSF provide immune surveillance and nutrient exchange. Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces a granulomatous inflammatory response mediated by activated macrophages, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and interferon-gamma, leading to exudate formation at the base of the brain. This causes obstruction of CSF flow, hydrocephalus, and vasculitis of cerebral vessels. The inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) increase vascular permeability, resulting in high protein content. Glucose consumption by both host cells and mycobacteria lowers CSF glucose. Temporal progression is subacute, over weeks, with compensatory mechanisms initially maintaining intracranial pressure until decompensation occurs.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present subacutely over 1\u20134 weeks with headache (90%), fever (70%), neck stiffness (50%), and altered mental status. Focal deficits (cranial neuropathies, particularly VI and VII) occur in up to 30%. Early prodrome includes weight loss, night sweats, and anorexia. Without treatment, mortality exceeds 20\u201350%, with survivors often left with neurological sequelae such as cognitive impairment, motor deficits, and hydrocephalus.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes CSF analysis (cell count with differential, protein, glucose, Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, culture), with Xpert MTB/RIF molecular assay recommended by WHO (sensitivity ~60\u201370%, specificity > 95%). MRI brain with contrast shows basal meningeal enhancement, tuberculomas, and hydrocephalus. Second-tier tests include CSF adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels (>10 U/L suggestive) and interferon-gamma assays. Culture remains gold standard but may take 4\u20136 weeks. Pre-test probability is high in endemic settings and immunocompromised patients.","management_principles":"Recommended regimen follows WHO and national guidelines: a four-drug intensive phase (isoniazid 5 mg/kg, rifampin 10 mg/kg, pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg, ethambutol 15\u201320 mg/kg daily) for 2 months, followed by continuation with isoniazid and rifampin for 10 months. Adjunctive corticosteroids (dexamethasone or prednisolone) reduce mortality and neurologic sequelae (Class I, Level A evidence). Monitoring includes liver function tests, vision screening for ethambutol toxicity, and adherence support.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require monthly clinical assessment for treatment adherence, adverse effects, and neurologic status. Baseline and periodic liver enzymes (monthly for first three months, then every three months) and vision testing are recommended. MRI at 2\u20133 months assesses resolution of meningeal enhancement and hydrocephalus. Continue follow-up for at least 12 months post-treatment to monitor for relapse.","clinical_pearls":"1. High CSF protein (>200 mg/dL) with low glucose (<40 mg/dL) and lymphocytic pleocytosis is hallmark of tuberculous meningitis. 2. PCR-based Xpert MTB/RIF improves rapid diagnosis; negative result does not exclude TB. 3. Adjunctive corticosteroids reduce mortality\u2014start early. 4. Basal meningeal enhancement on MRI is highly suggestive. 5. Untreated tuberculous meningitis has >50% mortality and high rate of sequelae.","references":"1. Thwaites GE, et al.
