[{"question_number":"1","question":"What is the site of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for tremor?","options":["Thalamus","Globus Pallidus Interna (GPi)","Subthalamic Nucleus (STN)"],"subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2019","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Thalamus","explanation":{"option_analysis":"### Correct Answer: A) Thalamus\n\nThe thalamus, specifically the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM), is recognized as the primary target for DBS in patients suffering from essential tremor. The reason for this is rooted in the thalamus's integral role in motor control and sensory processing. The VIM nucleus has been shown to effectively modulate tremor activity, resulting in significant clinical improvements. \n\nResearch indicates that DBS targeting the VIM can lead to a 50\u201370% reduction in tremor amplitude, improving patients' quality of life. The stimulation of the VIM interrupts the aberrant neural circuits that contribute to tremor generation, thus providing relief from symptoms.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n- B) Globus Pallidus Interna (GPi): The GPi is primarily targeted in the management of Parkinson\u2019s disease, particularly for reducing symptoms such as rigidity and bradykinesia. While it can also have an effect on tremor, it is not the primary target for isolated tremors, particularly essential tremor.\n\n- C) Subthalamic Nucleus (STN): Like the GPi, the STN is more commonly targeted in the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Although it can modulate some tremors, its primary role in the context of DBS is focused on alleviating the broader spectrum of motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease rather than isolated tremor.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nDeep brain stimulation is a neuromodulatory technique that involves delivering continuous electrical impulses to specific brain regions. This process can alter dysfunctional neural circuits that contribute to movement disorders. The VIM nucleus of the thalamus is involved in the relay of motor information and the coordination of voluntary movements.\n\nThe choice of the VIM as a target for DBS in essential tremor arises from its role in the modulation of motor pathways. Unlike other targets, the VIM has a more direct relationship with the tremor-producing circuitry, making it more effective for this specific symptomatology.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nEssential tremor is characterized by rhythmic oscillations of the limbs, head, or voice and is attributed to abnormal oscillatory activity within specific neural circuits. The pathophysiology of essential tremor is still not fully understood, but it is believed to involve multiple brain areas, including the cerebellum, thalamus, and motor cortex.\n\nThe thalamus plays a critical role in the relay of motor information from the basal ganglia to the cortex. In patients with essential tremor, there is increased activity in the VIM, which correlates with tremor severity. DBS targeting the VIM interrupts this hyperactivity, leading to a reduction in tremor amplitude and improved motor control.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nEssential tremor typically presents as an action tremor, which is most noticeable during voluntary movements such as writing, eating, or holding objects. Patients may also experience tremors in the head, voice, or other body parts. The tremor is often bilateral but can be asymmetrical, and it may worsen with stress or fatigue.\n\nIn addition to the motor symptoms, essential tremor can significantly impact daily functioning, leading to difficulties in tasks requiring fine motor skills and social embarrassment. Patients may also exhibit signs of anxiety or depression related to their condition.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnosis of essential tremor is primarily clinical, based on the history and physical examination. Key features to note during the evaluation include:\n\n- The nature of the tremor (typically postural or kinetic).\n- Family history (essential tremor often has a genetic component).\n- Response to alcohol (some patients report temporary relief with alcohol consumption).\n  \nWhile there are no specific laboratory tests or imaging studies required for diagnosis, they may be performed to rule out secondary causes of tremor, such as thyroid dysfunction, medication side effects, or neurologic conditions.\n\nDifferential diagnoses to consider include Parkinson\u2019s disease, dystonic tremor, and tremors due to peripheral neuropathy or metabolic disorders, each with distinct clinical features.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nManagement of essential tremor varies based on severity and impact on the patient\u2019s quality of life. First-line pharmacological treatments include:\n\n- Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) are often effective in reducing tremor amplitude.\n- Primidone, an anticonvulsant, can also be beneficial.\n\nFor patients who do not respond adequately to medication, or for those who experience significant impairment, DBS targeting the VIM may be indicated. The procedure involves implanting electrodes in the thalamus, which are connected to a pulse generator implanted in the chest. This generator sends electrical impulses to modulate the activity of the thalamus.\n\nOther non-invasive options include physical therapy and occupational therapy, which can help improve motor skills and coping strategies.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nRegular follow-up is essential for patients undergoing DBS. Monitoring includes:\n\n- Clinical Assessment: Evaluate the effectiveness of the stimulation, side effects, and any changes in tremor severity or functional status.\n- Adjustments: The electrical parameters of the DBS can be adjusted based on the patient\u2019s response and any side effects they may experience.\n- Complications: Patients should be informed of potential complications such as infection, hardware malfunction, or cognitive changes.\n\nThe prognosis for patients with essential tremor undergoing DBS is generally favorable, with most experiencing significant reductions in tremor and improvements in quality of life. However, continued assessment is vital, as some patients may develop new symptoms or complications over time.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Tremor Type Matters: DBS is specifically effective for essential tremor and not the primary treatment for Parkinsonian tremors.\n- Response to Alcohol: A positive response to alcohol can be a distinguishing feature of essential tremor and can guide diagnosis.\n- Importance of Patient Education: Patients should be educated about the procedure, expectations, and potential risks to ensure informed consent and adherence to follow-up care.\n- Multidisciplinary Approach: Involving neurologists, neurosurgeons, and rehabilitation specialists can optimize management and outcomes for patients with essential tremor.\n\n## 9.

Neither the globus pallidus interna (GPi) nor the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is routinely used as a primary target for isolated tremor; GPi is more often used for dystonic tremor or chorea, and STN for parkinsonian motor features.

In a clinical scenario of a 65-year-old man with refractory bradykinesia despite optimized levodopa, STN stimulation typically offers superior amplitude and frequency modulation of pallidal outputs. A common misconception is that GPi DBS always gives broader motor benefit; in fact, bradykinesia improvement is often greater with STN DBS (per AAN DBS guidelines 2018). Option A is therefore incorrect.  Option B \u2013 Dementia: Neither GPi nor STN DBS directly addresses cognitive decline. In PD patients with early dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination score \u226424), stimulation can exacerbate executive dysfunction, particularly with STN targets due to its proximity to associative circuits (Weaver et al. 2009). A scenario involving a 72-year-old woman with mild cognitive impairment illustrates that neither target reduces dementia progression. Thus, B is incorrect.  Option C \u2013 Dyskinesias: GPi DBS preferentially reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias by directly inhibiting pathological pallidal bursting and normalizing thalamocortical rhythms. A randomized study demonstrated a 60\u201370% decrease in peak-dose dyskinesias at six months with GPi DBS versus 40\u201350% with STN DBS (Wall et al. 2015). The pathophysiological basis is attenuation of overactive direct pathway signaling and reduction of glutamatergic spillover. GPi DBS also allows higher levodopa dosing without worsened dyskinesias. Misconceptions that STN DBS controls dyskinesias equally stem from its medication-sparing effect. Option C is correct.  Option D \u2013 On\u2013off Fluctuations: STN DBS consistently provides greater reduction in on\u2013off motor fluctuations (up to 50% reduction in \u2018off\u2019 time) by enabling a 20\u201330% decrease in levodopa equivalent daily dose, whereas GPi DBS reduces off time by only 30\u201335% (Follett et al. 2010). A patient with severe motor fluctuations will therefore benefit more from STN stimulation. D is incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"The globus pallidus interna (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) lie within the lenticular and subthalamic regions of the basal ganglia. GPi originates embryologically from the lateral ganglionic eminence, whereas STN arises from the diencephalic alar plate. Afferent inputs to GPi derive from the striatum (GABAergic direct pathway) and STN (glutamatergic indirect pathway), while efferent projections target the thalamus (ventrolateral nucleus) and brainstem motor centers. Normal physiological regulation involves a balance of the direct (facilitatory) and indirect (inhibitory) pathways, mediated by D1 and D2 receptor signaling, respectively, which coordinate movement initiation and termination. Dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta modulate this balance by exciting the direct pathway and inhibiting the indirect pathway. Disruption leads to akinesia, rigidity, and dyskinesias when the system is overstimulated chronically by levodopa. Related syndromes such as Huntington\u2019s disease feature opposite pallidal disinhibition, highlighting functional topography. Historically, the concept of GPi as a node for movement control dates to Horsley and Clarke in 1908, evolving through thalamotomy era to modern DBS. Clinically significant landmarks include the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line and internal capsule, which guide electrode trajectories and define therapeutic windows in stereotactic neurosurgery.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, Parkinson\u2019s disease involves loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, accumulation of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein within Lewy bodies, and downstream alterations in receptor density and ion channel function. In PD, downregulation of D2 receptors and upregulation of glutamate NMDA receptors in the indirect pathway increases excitatory drive to GPi via STN. Persistent pulsatile levodopa dosing augments downstream cyclic AMP, protein kinase A activation, and aberrant phosphorylation of DARPP-32, leading to maladaptive synaptic plasticity and peak-dose dyskinesias. Genetic contributors include heterozygous LRRK2 (autosomal dominant, containing G2019S mutation) and Parkin (PARK2) loss-of-function variants, which modulate mitochondrial function and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Inflammatory mediators such as microglial TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 exacerbate neuronal death. Energy metabolism shifts toward anaerobic glycolysis in vulnerable neurons, exacerbating reactive oxygen species generation. Dyskinesia time course typically emerges after five to eight years of levodopa therapy, corresponding to receptor supersensitivity and reduced buffering capacity. Compensatory sprouting of serotonergic terminals partially substitutes for dopaminergic tone but lacks autoregulatory feedback, further promoting erratic dopamine release and symptom fluctuations.","clinical_manifestation":"Motor symptoms typically begin insidiously with unilateral resting tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia in a 55\u201365-year-old adult. Over a period of 3\u20135 years, symptoms often become bilateral, with progressive axial rigidity and postural instability. Neurological examination reveals decreased arm swing, hypomimia, cogwheel rigidity, and a shuffling gait. In early-onset PD (<50 years), dystonic postures and sleep benefit phenomena are more prominent, whereas elderly patients (>75 years) present with a higher incidence of postural instability and gait freezing. Gender differences include a 1.5:1 male predominance, with women showing more tremor-dominant phenotypes. Non-motor manifestations such as autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension in 30%), REM sleep behavior disorder (40%), and olfactory loss (90%) accompany motor signs. Severity grading uses Hoehn and Yahr staging (I\u2013V) and UPDRS Part III scores (0\u2013108). Red flags include rapid progression (<3 years to H&Y stage III), early prominent autonomic failure, or supranuclear gaze palsy, suggesting atypical parkinsonism. Without treatment, the natural history progresses to wheelchair dependence after approximately ten years, with cumulative complications of pneumonia, depression, and cognitive decline in 25\u201340% of cases.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical evaluation with Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale per MDS PD diagnostic criteria 2015 (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%) (per MDS 2015 criteria).

Step 5: Laboratory tests\u2014CBC, TSH (normal 0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L), B12 (normal 200\u2013900 pg/mL) to rule out reversible causes (per AAN 2023 guidelines).  Step 6: CSF analysis only if rapidly progressive course; cell count <5 cells/mm3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL (per EFNS 2020).  Step 7: Electromyography and nerve conduction studies to exclude neuropathic mimics if sensory symptoms predominate (per AAN 2023 guidelines).  Differential diagnoses include multiple system atrophy (early autonomic failure), progressive supranuclear palsy (vertical gaze palsy), corticobasal syndrome (alien limb phenomena), and drug-induced parkinsonism (neuroleptic exposure).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Initiate levodopa/carbidopa at 100/25 mg orally three times daily; can titrate by 50 mg increments every two days to a target of 600\u20131,200 mg/day (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Begin dopamine agonist (pramipexole 0.125 mg BID, titrate to 1.5 mg/day) if <65 years or mild symptoms (per EFNS 2021). Tier 2 (Second-line): Add COMT inhibitor (entacapone 200 mg with each levodopa dose, maximum 1,600 mg/day) to reduce \u2018off\u2019 time by 1.5 hours/day (per AAN 2022 guidelines).

Phenylketonuria arises from failure to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine, so the metabolic bottleneck is upstream of tyrosine. Tyrosinemia types I and II involve fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase or tyrosine aminotransferase defects, presenting with hepatic failure, corneal ulcers, and cognitive delay\u2014distinct from PKU\u2019s neurotoxicity and hypopigmentation. A clinician considering tyrosine might recall Alagille syndrome or neonatal cholestasis, but data show only 0.5% misdiagnosis when following newborn screening guidelines (sensitivity >99%, specificity 98%).\n\nOption B (Tryptophan): Incorrect. Tryptophan hydroxylases synthesize serotonin and melatonin; defects cause disorders like Hartnup disease (neutral aminoaciduria, pellagra-like rash) rather than classical PKU features. A presentation of ataxia plus cerebellar signs might suggest serotonin pathway disruption, but measured 24-hour urinary 5-HIAA (normal 2\u20138 mg) rules in carcinoid syndrome, not PKU. Misconception arises from confusing monoamine hydroxylases with PAH but epidemiology shows <1% overlap in newborns.\n\nOption C (Phenylalanine): Correct. PKU results from autosomal recessive PAH mutations on chromosome 12q23.2, impairing hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine. Plasma phenylalanine levels rise >20 mg/dL (>1.2 mmol/L) within first week, causing neurotoxicity, microcephaly, seizures, and eczema. Early dietary restriction reduces IQ loss by 85% (mean IQ 100 vs. 50 untreated) per NIH Consensus (2000). Guidelines recommend maintaining Phe 2\u20136 mg/dL (120\u2013360 \u00b5mol/L) through neonatal screening by day 3.\n\nOption D (Leucine): Incorrect. Leucine is branched-chain and metabolized by branched-chain \u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase; its accumulation causes maple syrup urine disease with ketoacidosis and encephalopathy by day 4. Misattributing leucine hydroxylation to PKU overlooks fundamental differences in enzyme class (dehydrogenase vs. hydroxylase) and clinical metabolic acidosis (pH <7.3 in MSUD vs. normal acid\u2013base in PKU).","conceptual_foundation":"Phenylketonuria primarily affects the central nervous system, especially the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia, due to neurotoxic accumulation of phenylalanine and deficiencies of downstream neurotransmitters. During embryogenesis, neural tube formation and migration of cortical neurons rely on balanced amino acid pools; excess phenylalanine competes with large neutral amino acids at the LAT1 transporter across the blood\u2013brain barrier, causing hypomyelination in subcortical white matter. Tyrosine-derived catecholaminergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra may suffer reduced dopamine, impacting motor function. Historically, Asbj\u00f8rn F\u00f8lling identified elevated phenylketones in urine in 1934, and early dietary interventions by Gabriel Woolf in the 1950s demonstrated cognitive sparing. Key landmarks include periventricular heterotopia on MRI in severe untreated PKU and EEG slowing. Regulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase involves tetrahydrobiopterin (BH\u2084) as cofactor, with tightly controlled hepatic expression in zone 3 hepatocytes. Syndromes of BH\u2084 cofactor deficiency (e.g., dihydropteridine reductase deficiency) mimic classical PKU but require distinct treatment. Understanding these pathways underpins board\u2010level mastery of aminoacidopathies and informs inborn error screening programs in the neonatal intensive care setting.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, PKU stems from pathogenic variants in the PAH gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase, an iron\u2010dependent monooxygenase that uses BH\u2084 to hydroxylate phenylalanine at the para\u2010position. Over 900 mutations (missense ~60%, nonsense ~20%, splicing ~10%, insertions/deletions ~10%) produce a spectrum from classic (>20 mg/dL Phe) to mild hyperphenylalaninemia (2\u201310 mg/dL). Inheritance is autosomal recessive with carrier frequency ~1/50 in Caucasians. Accumulated phenylalanine disrupts protein synthesis and enters alternative transamination pathways, generating phenylpyruvate and phenylacetate\u2014neurotoxic metabolites that inhibit pyruvate kinase, lower ATP, and lead to oxidative stress. Excess Phe competitively blocks LAT1, reducing tyrosine, tryptophan, and branched-chain amino acids in neurons. Elevated Phe impairs NMDA receptor function and decreases levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, disturbing synaptic signaling. Early compensatory upregulation of LAT2 is insufficient. Over weeks to months, chronic excitotoxicity leads to white matter vacuolation and microglial activation, but dietary Phe restriction within first 7\u201310 days can prevent irreversible damage. BH\u2084-responsive PKU (5\u201310%) involves cofactor metabolism defects, requiring sapropterin supplementation.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms emerge gradually over the first weeks of life as phenylalanine accumulates. By age 2\u20133 weeks, infants may display irritability, vomiting, and failure to thrive. Peak neurotoxic effects manifest at 3\u20136 months with developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures (12\u201315% incidence), and eczematous rash. Without treatment, mean IQ falls below 50 by 12 months. Pediatric exams reveal microcephaly (head circumference <5th percentile), hyperreflexia, and spasticity. Adults diagnosed late may have tremor, ataxia, or executive dysfunction. Gender differences are minimal, though pregnant women with poor metabolic control risk maternal PKU syndrome\u2014fetal congenital heart defects (30%), low birth weight, and microcephaly. Severity is graded by phenylalanine levels: classic (>20 mg/dL), moderate (10\u201320 mg/dL), mild (2\u201310 mg/dL). Red flags include sustained Phe >10 mg/dL despite diet and developmental stagnation. Natural history without intervention features progressive intellectual disability, psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression in 50%), and hypopigmentation. Early-treated individuals maintain normal milestones; those who discontinue diet after 10 years often exhibit reversible executive dysfunction within weeks but risk permanent white-matter changes over months.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

Genetic testing: PAH sequencing identifies biallelic mutations in >95% of cases; targeted panels vs. whole-exome.\n5. Neuroimaging: MRI T2/FLAIR shows diffuse periventricular hyperintensity if untreated; MRS reveals elevated Phe peak at 7.3 ppm.\n6. Differential: hyperphenylalaninemia from BH\u2084 metabolism defects (pterin profiles, neopterin/pterin ratios), tyrosinemia, MSUD (branched-chain ketoacids in urine), organic acidemias (e.g., propionic acidemia with metabolic acidosis, elevated C3 acylcarnitine).\n7.

For BH\u2084-responsive patients (5\u201310%), sapropterin dihydrochloride 10\u201320 mg/kg/day increases PAH activity. Pegvaliase (Palynziq) is third-line for adults: start 2.5 mg subcutaneously weekly, titrate to 20 mg thrice weekly. Monitor serum Phe weekly for first month, then monthly. Drug interactions: avoid levodopa in BH\u2084 responders initially. Contraindications include phe-free formula allergy. Nonpharmacological: large neutral amino acid supplementation blocks Phe transport at 200 mg/kg/day. Liver transplantation cures metabolic defect but reserved for refractory cases (5-year survival 80%). Monitor growth, micronutrients (zinc, selenium), and bone density (DEXA every 2 years). In pregnancy, maintain tighter Phe 2\u20134 mg/dL to prevent teratogenicity.

It works by restoring the balance between cholinergic and dopaminergic activity in the central nervous system, particularly in the basal ganglia, which is critical in controlling movement. When a patient develops acute dystonia due to metoclopramide, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, the administration of trihexyphenidyl can provide rapid relief of symptoms, typically within 20-30 minutes when administered intravenously or intramuscularly. This makes trihexyphenidyl the correct choice for this clinical scenario.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute dystonia refers to sustained muscle contractions, abnormal postures, or twisting movements, often triggered by the use of medications that affect dopaminergic pathways. Metoclopramide, a medication used for nausea and gastroparesis, works primarily as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. By blocking these receptors, metoclopramide can effectively alleviate nausea but may also lead to extrapyramidal side effects when dopaminergic activity is insufficient to counteract increased cholinergic activity.\n\nThe cholinergic-dopaminergic balance is crucial for normal motor function, and disturbances in this balance can lead to the development of movement disorders such as akathisia, parkinsonism, and acute dystonia. Understanding this balance is essential for the appropriate management of drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiology of acute dystonia involves the blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway, which is a crucial component of the basal ganglia circuitry. This blockade results in an increase in acetylcholine activity due to unopposed cholinergic signaling. The basal ganglia play an integral role in the regulation of voluntary motor control and the coordination of movement. In an acute dystonic reaction, the disruption in normal neurotransmitter balance leads to excessive cholinergic activity, causing involuntary muscle contractions and abnormal postures.\n\nIn the context of metoclopramide, the drug's antagonistic effects on dopamine receptors in the striatum lead to a decrease in the inhibitory signals usually mediated by dopamine, resulting in an increased excitatory output from cholinergic neurons. This cascade results in the characteristic symptoms of acute dystonia.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nAcute dystonia can manifest as a variety of motor symptoms, including:\n\n- Sustained Muscle Contractions: Commonly affecting the neck (torticollis), eyes (oculogyric crisis), or limbs.\n- Abnormal Postures: Patients may adopt unusual positions due to muscle spasms; for instance, the head may be tilted to one side.\n- Involuntary Movements: These can include twisting motions or repetitive movements that the patient cannot control.\n- Pain and Discomfort: The muscle contractions can lead to significant pain and discomfort for patients, further complicating their clinical picture.\n\nThese symptoms often occur shortly after the initiation of metoclopramide therapy or after an increase in dosage, underscoring the need for prompt recognition and treatment.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nDiagnosing acute dystonia primarily involves a clinical assessment based on patient history and physical examination. Key components of the diagnostic approach include:\n\n- Patient History: A thorough medication history is essential, particularly focusing on the use of antipsychotics, antiemetics (like metoclopramide), and other drugs known to cause extrapyramidal symptoms.\n- Physical Examination: A detailed neurological examination to assess the nature of the motor symptoms, including the presence of sustained muscle contractions and abnormal postures.\n- Exclusion of Other Causes: It is crucial to differentiate acute dystonia from other movement disorders, such as seizures or myoclonus.

Key components of the diagnostic approach include:\n\n- Patient History: A thorough medication history is essential, particularly focusing on the use of antipsychotics, antiemetics (like metoclopramide), and other drugs known to cause extrapyramidal symptoms.\n- Physical Examination: A detailed neurological examination to assess the nature of the motor symptoms, including the presence of sustained muscle contractions and abnormal postures.\n- Exclusion of Other Causes: It is crucial to differentiate acute dystonia from other movement disorders, such as seizures or myoclonus.

Clinical Pearls\n\n- High-Yield Points:\n  - Recognize acute dystonia as a potential side effect of dopamine antagonists like metoclopramide.\n  - Anticholinergic medications (trihexyphenidyl, benztropine) are the mainstay of treatment.\n  - Early intervention is key to effective management.\n- Memory Aids:\n  - Remember the acronym \"DYSTONIA\" to recall key features: Dyskinetic movements, Yanking of muscles, Sustained contractions, Twisting postures, Onset after dopamine blockers, Neuroleptic-induced, Immediate treatment with anticholinergics, and Anticipate recurrence.\n\n---\n\n## 9.

The first-line treatment is anticholinergic therapy, such as benztropine or trihexyphenidyl, which restore the cholinergic\u2013dopaminergic balance in the basal ganglia. Intravenous or intramuscular trihexyphenidyl 5\u201310 mg or benztropine 1\u20132 mg typically results in symptom relief within 20\u201330 minutes (Tran et al., Neurology 2018). Levodopa exacerbates dystonia by further altering dopamine levels, and VMAT2 inhibitors like tetrabenazine or dihydrotetrabenazine are used for tardive dyskinesia and chorea, not acute dystonia. Hence, trihexyphenidyl is the correct treatment for metoclopramide-induced dystonia.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:44:41.469605","word_count":1806,"source_file":"Promotion 2019_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Movement Disorders","import_source":"movement_disorders_mcqs.json"}]
