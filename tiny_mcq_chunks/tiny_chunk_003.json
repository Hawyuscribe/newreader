Any percutaneous exposure to potentially infectious blood must be reported immediately to infection control or occupational health (CDC, 2013; WHO, 2014). Early reporting triggers prompt risk assessment, baseline testing, and initiation of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) when indicated. Option B (Respect the nurse\u2019s need) is incorrect because clinicians have an ethical and regulatory obligation to report exposures to protect both the staff member and patients. Option C (Check the patient file) is insufficient: while reviewing the source patient\u2019s status is part of follow-up, it cannot replace formal reporting. Option D (Screen the patient for HIV, HBV, and HCV) is an appropriate downstream step but only after the exposure is reported. Reporting is the critical first action.","conceptual_foundation":"Universal precautions\u2014treating all blood and bodily fluids as potentially infectious\u2014were codified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1985 and remain the cornerstone of occupational safety (CDC, 2008). Bloodborne pathogens of concern include HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) mandates written exposure control plans, training, engineering controls (e.g., safety-engineered devices), and immediate reporting of sharps injuries. Prompt reporting enables source-patient testing, risk stratification using algorithms such as the modified Wilson\u2013Jungner criteria for PEP candidacy, and initiation of prophylaxis per guidelines (AASLD/IDSA, 2018).","pathophysiology":"Needlestick injuries can introduce pathogens directly into the subcutaneous tissue and bloodstream. HIV is an enveloped retrovirus that infects CD4+ T-lymphocytes, integrating into host DNA via reverse transcriptase and integrase, with an estimated per-injury transmission risk of 0.3% (0.2\u20130.5%) (Cardo et al., 1997). HBV is a partially double-stranded DNA virus with percutaneous transmission risk of 6\u201330% in unvaccinated exposures (CDC, 2001). HCV, an enveloped RNA virus, carries a 1.8% (0\u20137%) risk per needlestick (CDC, 2013). Cellular uptake relies on receptor-mediated endocytosis (e.g., CD81 for HCV) and viral uncoating; the viral genome is then replicated, leading to systemic infection. Prophylactic antivirals (e.g., zidovudine plus lamivudine for HIV) disrupt reverse transcription, reducing seroconversion risk by >80% if started within 2 hours (USPHS, 2013).","clinical_manifestation":"Most needlestick exposures are asymptomatic initially. If infection occurs, acute retroviral syndrome (fever, rash, lymphadenopathy) manifests in 60\u201380% of HIV seroconverters within 2\u20136 weeks (Hammer et al., 1997). Acute HBV may present with malaise, anorexia, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice 1\u20134 months post-exposure. HCV is frequently asymptomatic; around 15\u201345% spontaneously clear infection, while 55\u201385% develop chronic hepatitis with insidious ALT elevations. Prodromal symptoms are nonspecific. Natural history without prophylaxis shows seroconversion rates matching the per-injury risks above. High-risk exposures (deep injury, hollow-bore needle, visible blood) increase transmission probabilities two- to four-fold (Kuhar et al., 2013).","diagnostic_approach":"First, report the incident and perform a baseline evaluation of the exposed worker: HIV Ag/Ab test, HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HCV, and ALT. Source-patient consent should be obtained per institutional policy; rapid HIV tests (sensitivity >99.5%, specificity >99.5%) guide immediate PEP decisions (CDC, 2013). Post-exposure testing for the source includes the same serologies. Follow-up testing for the worker: HIV Ag/Ab at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months; HCV RNA at 6 weeks and anti-HCV at 6 months; ALT at each visit. Pre-test probability based on community prevalence informs interpretation; NPV of baseline negative HIV Ag/Ab is >99.9%.","management_principles":"Immediate management: wash the site with soap and water (no scrubbing or provocation of bleeding). Evaluate exposure risk: type of fluid, device, and patient status. For high-risk HIV exposures, initiate a 4-week PEP regimen within 2 hours, typically tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine plus raltegravir (USPHS, 2013; AASLD/IDSA, 2018). For HBV, if the worker is unvaccinated or non-responder, administer hepatitis B immune globulin and begin vaccine series. No approved HCV PEP exists; early identification allows direct-acting antiviral therapy if seroconversion occurs. Monitor for drug toxicities: renal function for tenofovir, hepatotoxicity for zidovudine.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 2 weeks (PEP tolerance), 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Laboratory monitoring: HIV Ag/Ab (6 wk, 3 mo, 6 mo), HCV RNA (6 wk) and anti-HCV (6 mo), ALT panel at each visit. Assess adherence, side effects, and psychological impact. Discontinue PEP early if source is confirmed negative. Provide counseling on safe practices and risk reduction. For HBV, confirm seroconversion after vaccination (anti-HBs \u226510 mIU/mL).","clinical_pearls":"1. Always report and document all percutaneous exposures immediately to enable timely PEP (PEP efficacy declines significantly after 24 hours). 2. HIV PEP with tenofovir/emtricitabine + raltegravir reduces seroconversion by >80% when started within 2 hours. 3. HBV transmission risk is higher than HIV; ensure healthcare workers have documented immunity. 4. No HCV PEP exists\u2014early detection and treatment with direct-acting antivirals is critical. 5. Baseline and follow-up testing timelines are standardized: HIV at 0, 6 wk, 3 mo, 6 mo; HCV RNA at 6 wk.","references":"1. CDC.

Among the options provided, only option A \u2013 the \u201cHyoid muscle\u201d \u2013 corresponds to the hyoglossus, which originates from the hyoid bone and is innervated by CN XII. Options B (Iliopsoas), C (Quadriceps), and D (Obturator internus) are all supplied by branches of the lumbar or sacral plexus (femoral and obturator nerves) and are not innervated by any cranial nerves. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.","conceptual_foundation":"The hypoglossal nerve originates from the hypoglossal nucleus in the dorsal medulla, exits the skull via the hypoglossal canal, and descends into the neck to innervate tongue musculature. It provides motor fibers to four extrinsic muscles (genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus, and palatoglossus is the exception innervated by vagus via pharyngeal plexus) and all intrinsic muscles of the tongue. Understanding skull base anatomy and cranial nerve exit foramina is critical: CN XII traverses the hypoglossal canal close to the occipital condyle.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, CN XII carries lower motor neuron fibers that synapse on muscle fibers of the tongue, facilitating protrusion (primarily via genioglossus) and retraction (hyoglossus and styloglossus). Lesions of CN XII (due to tumors, vascular insults, or trauma) disrupt neuromuscular transmission, leading to denervation, muscle atrophy, and fasciculations. Clinically, this presents as tongue deviation towards the side of the lesion on protrusion, reflecting unopposed action of contralateral genioglossus.","clinical_manifestation":"Hypoglossal nerve palsy results in ipsilateral tongue weakness: atrophy and fasciculations of tongue musculature, deviation on protrusion, and dysarthria or dysphagia if severe. There are no deficits in limb muscles such as iliopsoas, quadriceps, or obturator internus, which distinguishes cranial from peripheral plexus lesions.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is established by clinical exam demonstrating tongue deviation, EMG showing denervation potentials in tongue muscles, and imaging (MRI of brainstem and skull base) to identify structural lesions. There is no role for lumbar plexus studies in isolated CN XII palsy.","management_principles":"Treatment targets the underlying cause: surgical resection for neoplasms compressing the hypoglossal canal, anticoagulation for vascular lesions, steroids for inflammatory neuropathies, and physical therapy (speech and swallow) for functional rehabilitation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients with CN XII injury require periodic assessment of tongue strength, speech intelligibility, and swallow safety.

Examination was significant for decreased pinprick sensation bilaterally over the upper limbs. Motor and vibration sensation were intact. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Syringomyelia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Syringomyelia","subspecialty":"Neuroanatomy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Syringomyelia. Syringomyelia is characterized by a fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) within the central spinal cord, which preferentially disrupts the crossing fibers of the spinothalamic tract in the anterior commissure. This produces a bilateral, progressive \u2018\u2018cape-like\u2019\u2019 loss of pain and temperature sensations over the upper extremities without affecting dorsal column modalities (vibration and proprioception) or motor function until later stages. No other condition among the options (none provided) offers this precise dissociation of sensory modalities with sparing of dorsal columns and motor pathways in a young adult female. Historical neuropathology (Horsley, 1893) and subsequent clinical series (Klekamp et al., 2019) confirm the signature presentation of central cord cavitation leading to segmental pain\u2013temperature deficits with preservation of other modalities until expansion of the syrinx.","conceptual_foundation":"Syringomyelia is classified in ICD-11 under 8A61.00 (Syringomyelia) and is often associated with Chiari I malformation (8A61.01) or spinal cord trauma (8A61.Z). The lesion arises from aberrant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics within the central canal, producing a longitudinal cavity. Embryologically, the central canal derives from the neural tube\u2019s lumen; failure of normal canal obliteration or acquired blockages can lead to syrinx formation. Neuroanatomically, the spinothalamic tract decussates within one to two segments above entry, traversing the anterior commissure, which is most vulnerable in a central syrinx. Adjacent dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts lie dorsal and lateral to the syrinx cavity and remain intact until advanced stages. Knowledge of spinal microanatomy, CSF flow pathways, and Chiari malformation associations is essential for understanding syringomyelia.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology features laminar CSF flow from the ventricles through the subarachnoid space around the brain and spinal cord. In syringomyelia, impaired CSF flow at the foramen magnum or within the spinal subarachnoid space leads to pressure dissociation and fluid ingress into the central canal. The syrinx expands longitudinally, compressing first the anterior commissure (spinothalamic decussation), resulting in pain\u2013temperature loss, then adjacent gray and white matter structures. Molecularly, altered ependymal cell junctions and perivascular spaces facilitate fluid accumulation. Over time, syrinx expansion may disrupt anterior horn cells (leading to LMN signs) or lateral corticospinal tracts (UMN signs), but early-stage syringomyelia spares motor fibers, explaining normal strength in this case.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in the second to fourth decades with insidious onset of segmental pain and temperature loss in a \u2018\u2018shawl\u2019\u2019 distribution, most pronounced over the shoulders and upper limbs. Approximately 70% of idiopathic syringomyelia patients report dysesthetic pain, whereas 60% have segmental sensory loss. Motor weakness and atrophy develop in up to 30% of cases as the syrinx enlarges. Rarely, Charcot arthropathy of the shoulders or hands occurs due to proprioceptive deficits. Physical examination reveals dissociated sensory loss (pinprick and temperature) with intact vibration and proprioception; reflexes are normal until corticospinal involvement.","diagnostic_approach":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical and thoracic spine with T2-weighted sequences is the gold standard (sensitivity and specificity >95%). MRI demonstrates a T2-hyperintense CSF-filled cavity within the cord. Phase-contrast cine MRI may assess CSF flow dynamics at the foramen magnum. Neurological examination guides imaging levels. In resource-limited settings, high-resolution CT myelography can identify syrinx cavities but with lower sensitivity (~85%) and invasiveness. No laboratory biomarkers are diagnostic.","management_principles":"Management depends on symptom severity and syrinx etiology. Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients may undergo surveillance with serial MRI every 6\u201312 months. Surgical intervention (posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty for Chiari-associated syringomyelia or syrinx\u2013subarachnoid shunt for idiopathic syringomyelia) is indicated for progressive neurological deficits or intractable pain. Posterior fossa decompression yields clinical improvement in 70\u201380% of patients (Class I evidence, Klekamp et al. 2019). Analgesics and gabapentinoids may address neuropathic pain symptoms.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI at 3\u20136 months assesses syrinx regression; further imaging at yearly intervals for 2 years is recommended. Neurological exams every 6 months monitor sensory and motor function. Persistence or recurrence of syrinx may require shunt revision or repeated decompression. Long-term follow-up extends for at least 5 years due to risk of delayed recurrence. Rehabilitation focuses on strengthening and sensory retraining.","clinical_pearls":"1. Syringomyelia causes dissociated sensory loss (pain\u2013temperature) with preserved vibration: hallmark clinical finding. 2. A \u2018\u2018cape-like\u2019\u2019 distribution over the shoulders and upper limbs is highly suggestive. 3. MRI with T2-weighted sequences is the diagnostic gold standard (>95% sensitivity). 4. Chiari I malformation is present in up to 75% of syringomyelia cases; assess the foramen magnum. 5.
