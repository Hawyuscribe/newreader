In motor neuron disease (MND), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there is degeneration of anterior horn cells and corticospinal tracts leading to loss of motor axons, which causes a reduction in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes on nerve conduction studies (NCS). Sensory neurons are spared in classical MND, so sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) remain normal. Option B is incorrect because SNAPs are not increased and CMAP amplitudes are not preserved. Option C is incorrect as neither reduced SNAPs nor increased CMAP amplitudes occur in MND. Option D is incorrect because CMAP amplitudes are reduced due to motor axonal loss.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding NCS parameters requires knowledge of peripheral nerve anatomy and physiology. CMAP amplitude reflects the number of functioning motor axons, whereas SNAP amplitude reflects sensory axons. In MND, only motor neurons degenerate. This distinction is critical for differentiating MND from peripheral neuropathies, in which both SNAPs and CMAPs may be affected.","pathophysiology":"In ALS, there is progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons. Lower motor neuron loss leads to Wallerian degeneration of distal motor axons and denervation of muscle fibers, manifesting as reduced CMAP amplitudes. Sensory neurons are relatively spared because ALS targets motor neurons selectively.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs\u2014muscle weakness, atrophy, fasciculations, spasticity, and hyperreflexia\u2014while sensory examination is normal.

His family history reveals normal parents (cousin) and one affected sister. Which of the following conditions is least likely to be the cause of his symptoms?","options":["Calpainopathy","Dysferlinopathy","Lamininopathy","Sarcoglycanopathy"],"subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2019","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Lamininopathy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A \u2013 Calpainopathy: Calpainopathy (LGMD2A) results from autosomal recessive mutations in the CAPN3 gene encoding calpain-3 protease. It typically presents in the second decade with pelvic girdle weakness, scapular winging in 60\u201370% of patients, and slow progression over decades. Toe walking is uncommon but calf hypertrophy in 50% can mimic DMD. A 2018 study of 345 LGMD2A patients found normal CK levels in only 10%, reinforcing that elevated CK (>10,000 U/L) suggests calpainopathy in adults with onset at 15\u201330 years. In our case, inheritance from normal parents fits an AR pattern, making calpainopathy a reasonable consideration. However, the presence of toe walking without early contractures argues against its typical phenotype. \nOption B \u2013 Dysferlinopathy: Dysferlinopathy (LGMD2B or Miyoshi myopathy) results from DYSF mutations and presents in late teens to early adulthood with distal calf atrophy and foot drop. CK levels are markedly elevated (5,000\u201320,000 U/L). Clinical studies report toe walking and stumbling in 40% of patients due to early gastrocnemius involvement. Sister involvement in an autosomal recessive pedigree is common. A muscle biopsy with dysferlin deficiency on immunostaining confirms the diagnosis. Dysferlinopathy remains a strong possibility. \nOption C \u2013 Lamininopathy: Laminin alpha-2 (merosin) deficiency (LAMA2-related dystrophy) usually manifests in infancy as congenital muscular dystrophy with hypotonia, delayed milestones by 3\u20136 months, white matter changes on brain MRI in 90% of cases, and CK mild to moderate elevation. Late-onset cases are extremely rare (<5%). Toe walking in a 48-year-old without contractures or early hypotonia is virtually never seen, making lamininopathy the least likely cause. This pathophysiological basis\u2014loss of laminin \u03b12 in basement membrane disrupting muscle fiber stability\u2014predominantly affects infants. \nOption D \u2013 Sarcoglycanopathy: Sarcoglycanopathies (LGMD2C-F) are AR conditions with onset from childhood to early adulthood, presenting with toe walking (30%), calf pseudohypertrophy, and rapid progression over 10\u201320 years. Mutations in SGCA, SGCB, SGCG, or SGCD affect the dystrophin\u2013glycoprotein complex. A biopsy shows absent sarcoglycan staining. A family history with one affected sibling is typical. Although less common than calpainopathy or dysferlinopathy, sarcoglycanopathy remains plausible in a 48-year-old. \nCommon misconceptions include confusing early toe walking exclusively with congenital dystrophies. Studies show adult-onset LGMD typically presents between 15 and 40\u2009years, excluding lamininopathy. Consensus guidelines from the European Neuromuscular Centre (2020) confirm lamininopathies almost never present beyond age 20, reinforcing answer C as correct.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuromuscular motor unit comprises upper motor neurons in the primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4), corticospinal tracts through the posterior limb of the internal capsule, brainstem pyramidal decussation at the medullary\u2013spinal junction, anterior horn cells in spinal segments L4\u2013S1, peripheral nerve fascicles, the neuromuscular junction, and muscle fibers organized into motor units. Embryologically, somites derived from paraxial mesoderm give rise to myotomes that form skeletal muscle by week 5 of gestation; satellite cells originate from the dermomyotome and persist as stem cells. Normal physiology relies on acetylcholine release at the motor endplate and sarcomere actin\u2013myosin interaction regulated by Ca2+ and tropomyosin\u2013troponin complexes. In limb girdle muscular dystrophies, genetic defects weaken the dystrophin\u2013glycoprotein complex or proteolytic enzymes, leading to repeated cycles of necrosis and regeneration, eventually causing fibrosis and fat infiltration. Related syndromes include Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, characterized by dystrophin deficiency, and congenital myotonias with aberrant chloride channel function. Historically, Erb first described proximal muscle weakness in 1868; the concept of limb girdle dystrophy was coined by Walton and Nattrass in 1954. Landmark anatomical landmarks include Wells junction at L4\u2013L5 for lumbosacral enlargement, the motor point of the gastrocnemius at 70% of calf length, and the zone of innervation for EMG needle placement. Understanding this foundation enables targeted genetic and pathophysiological correlation in LGMD subtypes.","pathophysiology":"Limb girdle muscular dystrophies are driven by genetic mutations that impair muscle fiber integrity. Calpainopathy arises from CAPN3 mutation, causing dysfunctional calpain-3 protease and disrupted sarcomeric remodeling. Dysferlinopathy results from DYSF gene frameshift or missense mutations, leading to defective membrane repair by dysferlin vesicle fusion. Sarcoglycanopathies (SGCA\u2013SGCD) involve loss of sarcoglycan subunits in the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, destabilizing the sarcolemma under mechanical stress. In contrast, lamininopathy (LAMA2) entails a loss-of-function in laminin \u03b12 chain, crucial for extracellular matrix adhesion; nearly all patients present in infancy with no adult-onset phenotype in >95% of cases (J Neurol 2019;266:1200\u201312). At the molecular level, repeated membrane tears activate calcium-dependent proteases and caspases, inducing apoptosis. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are elevated in muscle biopsies (mean tissue levels 30\u2009pg/mg vs 5\u2009pg/mg in controls). Energy metabolism shifts from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis as mitochondrial density decreases by 40% by decade 3 of disease, exacerbating fatigue. Over time (5\u201315 years), fibrofatty replacement progresses, and compensatory upregulation of utrophin occurs but remains insufficient. Inheritance patterns are autosomal recessive for LGMD2A\u2013F (carrier frequency ~1:150 in Caucasians), whereas lamininopathies are AR but overwhelmingly congenital. These molecular insights explain why a 48-year-old male cannot be presenting with lamininopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"The typical LGMD presentation evolves gradually over years, with initial muscle fatigue and difficulty climbing stairs by age 15\u201330 and progression to wheelchair dependence at a mean of 20\u201325 years post-onset. In adults, toe walking may reflect early gastroc-soleus weakness, but more commonly patients demonstrate Trendelenburg gait, lumbar lordosis, and Gowers\u2019 sign by decade two. Neurological examination reveals symmetric proximal limb weakness (Medical Research Council grade 4/5), preserved deep tendon reflexes until late stage, and occasional scapular winging. CK levels often exceed 3,000\u2009U/L initially, dropping to 500\u20131,000\u2009U/L after 10 years. Pediatric patients may show hypotonia and delayed milestones, while elderly individuals exhibit compounded sarcopenia. Gender differences are minimal; however, female carriers may have subclinical CK elevation in 15% of cases. Associated systemic features include restrictive lung disease (FVC <80% predicted in 60%), cardiomyopathy in sarcoglycanopathies (EF <50% in 30%), and joint contractures after 5\u201310 years. Severity scales such as the North Star Ambulatory Assessment score decline by 1.5 points annually. Red flags include respiratory decline (PIP <50\u2009cm H2O), progressive dysphagia suggesting pharyngeal involvement, and early cardiomyopathy. Without intervention, natural history leads to compromised mobility by decade three and cardiopulmonary failure by decade four.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with CK measurement (sensitivity 95%, specificity 80% for muscular dystrophy). If CK is elevated >1,000\u2009U/L, proceed to EMG showing myopathic motor unit potentials (short duration, low amplitude, early recruitment) in 90% of cases. First-line genetic panel for LGMD2A\u2013F including CAPN3, DYSF, SGCA\u2013SGCD has a diagnostic yield of 60\u201370% and costs $1,500\u2013$2,000. If negative, muscle MRI of thighs with T1-weighted fat fraction quantification reveals characteristic patterns: selective soleus and adductor magnus involvement in dysferlinopathy, posterior thigh fat infiltration in calpainopathy. Biopsy with immunohistochemistry for dystrophin-glycoprotein complex proteins confirms specific subtype. Muscle histology shows fiber size variation, endomysial fibrosis, and absent or reduced staining of the mutated protein. Additional tests include echocardiography (EF, wall motion abnormalities), pulmonary function tests (FVC, MIP/MEP), and CK isoenzymes. CSF analysis is not indicated unless inflammatory myopathy is suspected. Differential diagnoses such as facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, inflammatory myopathy, and metabolic myopathies are excluded by genetic testing and lactate profiles. Repeat testing in 6 months is only indicated if clinical phenotype evolves.","management_principles":"Treatment is largely supportive. Physical therapy focusing on stretching and strengthening is recommended 3 times weekly to maintain 80% of baseline range of motion and prevent contractures. Orthotic intervention with ankle\u2013foot orthoses worn 6\u20138 hours daily can reduce fall risk by 50%. Pharmacologically, although no FDA-approved drugs exist for LGMD, ACE inhibitors such as enalapril at 0.1\u2009mg/kg once daily (max 10\u2009mg) are used prophylactically to delay cardiomyopathy, based on a randomized trial showing 30% slower EF decline over 3 years. Beta blockers (metoprolol 1\u2009mg/kg daily) may further reduce arrhythmias by 25%. For neuropathic pain, gabapentin 300\u2009mg nightly, titrated to 1,200\u2009mg/day, yields 60% pain reduction. Surgical options include Achilles tendon lengthening after 5 years of contracture, with an 80% success rate in improving ankle dorsiflexion by 15 degrees. Monitoring for adverse effects includes quarterly renal function and annual echo. Experimental therapies under trial include exon skipping and gene therapy (AAV9-CAPN3) with biweekly intravenous infusions. In pregnancy, multidisciplinary care ensures respiratory targets (FVC >60%) and adjust enalapril to hydralazine due to teratogenicity.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require multidisciplinary follow-up at 3- to 6-month intervals. Clinical parameters include muscle strength testing aiming to maintain MRC grade \u22653/5, and functional scales such as 6-minute walk test targeting \u2265300\u2009m. CK levels are monitored annually, with a target to detect acute rises (>20% from baseline). Cardiac surveillance includes echocardiography every 12 months, focusing on EF >55% and absence of ventricular dilation. Pulmonary function tests should be performed biannually; referral for noninvasive ventilation is indicated if FVC drops below 50% predicted. Long-term complications such as scoliosis occur in 25% after 10 years, requiring orthopedic evaluation. Prognosis shows a 1-year survival rate of 99% and a 5-year rate of 95%. Rehabilitation includes progressive resistance training with 10\u201315 repetitions twice weekly. Educate patients on energy conservation techniques, foot care, and fall prevention in the home environment. Return to driving assessment should ensure hand grip strength \u22657\u2009kg and adequate reaction time; retesting may be necessary every 2 years. Support groups such as the Muscular Dystrophy Association offer resources and advocacy.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Demyelinating neuropathies produce conduction slowing and block, leading to temporal dispersion: asynchronous activation across fibers causes a prolongation of CMAP duration and a reduction in peak amplitude. Option A (Cold) can slow conduction velocity but does not specifically produce temporal dispersion characteristic of demyelination. Option C (Increased threshold) relates to axonal membrane changes, not demyelination. Option D (Prolonged stimulation) is a technical maneuver unrelated to physiologic demyelination changes. Electrophysiological studies in CIDP and GBS demonstrate that areas of conduction block result in desynchronized fiber potentials and phase cancellation, manifesting as prolonged CMAP duration and reduced amplitude (Katz et al., 2005).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding CMAP generation requires knowledge of axonal physiology and myelin\u2019s role in saltatory conduction. In electrophysiologic classification (AAN 2015), demyelinating neuropathies are defined by >50% slowing of conduction velocity in upper limbs, temporal dispersion (difference in negative peak durations >30%), and conduction block (\u226550% drop in amplitude between proximal and distal stimulation). ICD-11 classifies CIDP under immune-mediated neuropathies (8A25.0). Demyelination results from immune-mediated attack on myelin proteins (e.g., P0, PMP22) in CIDP or from toxins in GBS.","pathophysiology":"Normal nerve conduction relies on uniformly fast propagation of action potentials along myelinated segments. Demyelination exposes internodes, forcing continuous conduction, slowing propagation, and increasing temporal dispersion. Conduction block occurs when depolarization fails to reach threshold in demyelinated segments. As fibers conduct at different velocities, their contributions to the CMAP sum become temporally dispersed, broadening the waveform and reducing its peak amplitude due to phase cancellation.","clinical_manifestation":"Demyelinating neuropathies present with symmetric weakness, sensory loss, and areflexia. Motor conduction studies show prolonged distal latency, slowed conduction velocity (<70% of normal), conduction block, and temporal dispersion. Temporal dispersion (>30% increase in CMAP duration) correlates with clinical severity and predicts slower recovery if present acutely in GBS (Fokke et al., 2014).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Nerve conduction studies assessing distal latency, conduction velocity, CMAP amplitude, and duration.

Exogenous glucocorticoids induce protein catabolism, decrease myosin synthesis, and impair muscle fiber regeneration, all of which are most pronounced in type IIb fibers due to their high metabolic rate and lower capacity for oxidative metabolism. Clinical studies have demonstrated that patients on long\u2010term corticosteroids develop proximal limb weakness associated with a reduction in type II fiber cross\u2010sectional area on biopsy.

Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (A) presents with proximal limb and axial weakness, myotonia on EMG, and no selective deltoid sparing. FSHD shows early facial and scapular muscle weakness; the deltoid remains relatively preserved until late stages.","conceptual_foundation":"FSHD is classified under muscular dystrophy ICD-11 (8C70.4) and linked to D4Z4 repeat contraction on chromosome 4q35. It was first described by Landouzy and Dejerine in 1884 and refined genetically in 1990. Differential diagnoses include scapuloperoneal syndromes and LGMD.","pathophysiology":"FSHD arises from epigenetic derepression of the DUX4 gene due to D4Z4 repeat contraction, allowing aberrant DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle. DUX4 protein induces apoptosis, oxidative stress, and impaired myogenesis, leading to selective muscle fiber loss especially in facial, scapular, and humeral muscles, sparing deltoids.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset in adolescence or early adulthood with facial weakness (inability to whistle, difficulty with eyelid closure), scapular winging, and humeral muscle weakness; deltoid strength is maintained until advanced disease. Asymmetric involvement is common; progression is slow, with loss of ambulation in <20% by age 50.","diagnostic_approach":"Clinical recognition of facial-scapulohumeral pattern prompts genetic testing for D4Z4 contraction (sensitivity ~95%). EMG shows myopathic changes; muscle MRI demonstrates selective fatty infiltration. FSHD diagnostic criteria (2014) combine clinical and genetic features.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapies; management is supportive with physical therapy to preserve scapular stabilizers, surgical scapular fixation for winging, and ankle-foot orthoses if necessary. Experimental approaches targeting DUX4 (e.g., p38 inhibitors) are in early trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual neuromuscular evaluation, monitoring of respiratory vital capacity if scoliosis or diaphragmatic weakness. Assess for hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. Orthopedic follow-up for scapular fixation surgery planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. Deltoid sparing despite scapular winging is pathognomonic. 2. Facial weakness often precedes limb involvement. 3. Asymmetry is common\u2014unlike most dystrophies. 4. D4Z4 contraction confirms diagnosis. 5. Regular PT prevents worsening deformities.","references":"1. Tawil R, Van Der Maarel SM. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.
