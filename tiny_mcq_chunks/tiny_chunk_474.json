[{"question_number":"4","question":"A patient presents with a headache that came out of the blue and has persisted for 3 months. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["NDPH","SUNA","HC"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"NDPH","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH). NDPH is defined by ICHD-3 as a headache that starts abruptly on a particular day and persists daily for more than 3 months. Multiple cohort studies report NDPH\u2019s characteristic \u201cstart on a given day and never let go,\u201d with 100% of patients recalling the exact onset event. Option B (SUNA) describes short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with autonomic features, characterized by brief paroxysms (seconds to minutes) rather than a continuous headache. Option C (Hemicrania continua) is a unilateral continuous headache that responds absolutely to indomethacin, which is not described here.","conceptual_foundation":"NDPH belongs to the category of \u201cother primary headache disorders\u201d in ICHD-3 (code 4.10). It must be distinguished from chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache by sudden onset and lack of prior headache history. Historical descriptions date to the 1980s, but formal recognition came with ICHD-2. NDPH is coded G44.29 in ICD-11. The differential includes secondary causes (e.g., intracranial hypertension, infection), so neuroimaging and labs are often performed.","pathophysiology":"The pathophysiology of NDPH remains poorly understood. Hypotheses include persistent trigeminovascular activation and central sensitization. Some cases follow infections (e.g., EBV) or stress events, suggesting an inflammatory or immune-mediated trigger. Neurochemical studies reveal elevated CGRP and interleukin-6 in CSF in a subset of patients. Unlike episodic migraines, neurotransmitter cycling (serotonin, dopamine) does not fluctuate, supporting a steady-state central sensitization.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with a daily headache from onset, lasting >3 months, often bilateral and pressing/tightening in quality. Pain intensity varies from 4 to 7/10. Photophobia, phonophobia, or mild nausea may occur, but migrainous features are typically absent. Onset may correlate with an identifiable event in up to 40% of cases. Both sexes are equally affected, with onset in early adulthood.","diagnostic_approach":"After clinical suspicion of NDPH, first-tier evaluation includes MRI brain with contrast (to exclude secondary causes) and basic labs (CBC, ESR, CRP). If normal, diagnose primary NDPH. Lumbar puncture is considered if MRI is inconclusive or there are red flags. No specialized imaging or functional studies are required for routine diagnosis.","management_principles":"Treatment of NDPH is challenging, with no randomized controlled trials. Empiric trials include amitriptyline (up to 100 mg nightly), topiramate (up to 200 mg/day), and onabotulinumtoxinA injections (OFF-label). Response rates are low; only ~30% of patients report \u226550% improvement. Indomethacin trial is indicated to exclude hemicrania continua. Preventive migraine medications are often tried despite limited evidence.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 4\u20136 weeks to assess treatment response and tolerability. Use headache diaries to quantify daily intensity. Monitor for medication overuse headache if analgesics exceed 10 days/month. Consider referral to headache specialist for refractory cases or intractable pain.","clinical_pearls":"1. NDPH onset is memorably sudden\u2014ask patients the exact date. 2. Indomethacin responsiveness virtually excludes NDPH and points to hemicrania continua. 3. Imaging must rule out secondary daily headache causes. 4. Amitriptyline often helps with tension-type phenotypes. 5. NDPH can remit spontaneously in up to 20% of cases over 1\u20132 years.","references":"1. Vanast WJ. Benign new daily headache.

Pregabalin (option A) has only class C evidence and lower responder rates in retrospective series (around 30\u201340%), making lamotrigine the more supported choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is classified under ICD-11 code 8A8Y. It is characterized by paroxysmal, electric shock-like facial pain in one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Differential diagnoses include atypical facial pain, cluster headache, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Historically described by Fothergill in 1773, TN\u2019s pathogenesis has evolved from vascular compression models to include demyelination at the root entry zone.","pathophysiology":"Normal trigeminal conduction is mediated by fast myelinated A\u03b4 fibers. In TN, focal demyelination at the root entry zone (often due to vascular compression) leads to ephaptic cross-talk and hyperexcitability. Lamotrigine stabilizes the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, reducing abnormal discharges, whereas pregabalin binds the \u03b12\u03b4 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels with less direct effect on sodium channel pathophysiology.","clinical_manifestation":"TN presents with sudden, unilateral, lancinating facial pain lasting milliseconds to seconds, triggered by light touch or activities such as chewing. Type 1 (classic) TN has purely paroxysmal pain; type 2 includes constant background aching. Attack frequency can reach hundreds per day, severely impacting quality of life. Rare in childhood; peak incidence in those over 50 years, with slight female predominance.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical per ICHD-3 criteria: \u22653 attacks of unilateral facial pain fulfilling trigger and quality criteria, absence of neurological deficit, and MRI to exclude secondary causes (grade B recommendation).

High\u2010resolution functional imaging studies consistently demonstrate activation of the ipsilateral posterior hypothalamic gray matter during cluster headache attacks (May et al., 1998; Goadsby et al., 2001). PET scans show increased blood flow in this region coinciding with pain onset and periodicity. Option A (\u201cImbalance neurotraumatic in the trigeminal nerve\u201d) is incorrect because there is no evidence of traumatic injury to the trigeminal nerve in primary cluster headache; rather, trigeminal nociceptive pathways are secondarily activated by hypothalamic dysfunction. Option B (\u201cBrainstem change modulation\u201d) is incomplete: while brainstem centers (e.g., dorsal rostral pons) may play a role in migraine, cluster headache\u2019s generator is localized to the posterior hypothalamus, not the brainstem. Thus, C is the only option fully supported by human imaging and animal model data.","conceptual_foundation":"Cluster headache is classified under Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgias (TACs) in ICHD-3. It is characterized by strictly unilateral, severe periorbital pain with ipsilateral autonomic features and a circadian periodicity determined by hypothalamic pacemaker dysfunction. Developmentally, the hypothalamus arises from the diencephalon; the posterior hypothalamic gray matter integrates circadian signals from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The trigemino\u2010autonomic reflex arc involves afferent trigeminal fibers synapsing in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, projecting to the superior salivatory nucleus, and then via parasympathetic outflow to cranial vasculature.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: the posterior hypothalamus regulates circadian rhythms and homeostasis. In cluster headache, abnormal hyperexcitability of posterior hypothalamic neurons triggers periodic activation of the trigeminal autonomic reflex, causing release of vasoactive neuropeptides (CGRP, PACAP) and consequent severe unilateral head pain with autonomic signs. Functional MRI and PET studies reveal heightened hypothalamic activity preceding trigeminal activation. Animal models show that hypothalamic stimulation induces ipsilateral lacrimation and rhinorrhea via parasympathetic outflow.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with excruciating unilateral periorbital or temporal pain lasting 15\u2013180 minutes, occurring in clusters for weeks to months, often at night. Autonomic features include conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, ptosis, and miosis. Attacks follow circadian and circannual patterns. Prevalence is 0.1%, predominantly affecting men (3:1) in the third to fifth decades.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical per ICHD-3 criteria: \u22655 attacks of severe unilateral orbital/periorbital pain, duration 15\u2013180 minutes, accompanied by \u22651 ipsilateral autonomic symptom or restlessness/agitation. Brain MRI is recommended (Grade B) to exclude secondary causes when atypical features present. No specific biomarkers exist.","management_principles":"Acute therapy: high\u2010flow oxygen (12\u201315 L/min for 15 min) (Level A) and subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg (Level A). Transitional prophylaxis: prednisone taper. Preventive: verapamil up to 960 mg/day (Level A) with ECG monitoring. In refractory cases, posterior hypothalamic deep brain stimulation has shown benefit in small series.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up should occur every 4\u20136 weeks to monitor verapamil ECG changes, blood pressure, and symptom control. Adjust prophylaxis based on attack frequency. For patients on high-dose verapamil, monthly ECGs are advised until stable.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In TN, autonomic signs occur in <5% of cases, whereas this patient\u2019s 100% lacrimation suggests a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia. Option B: (Cluster Headache) signs include severe unilateral orbital pain with ipsilateral lacrimation and autonomic features, but attacks last 15\u2013180 minutes at frequency of 1\u20138/day; cluster pain is continuous, deep, and throbbing\u2014not brief shock-like bursts (<2 seconds) provoked by facial contact. Option C: (Paroxysmal Hemicrania) features short unilateral attacks lasting 2\u201330 minutes, frequency >5/day, exquisitely responsive to indomethacin (75\u2013150 mg/day), but here touch triggers pain\u2014a hallmark of TN phenotypes, not PH. Option D: (SUNCT/SUNA) attacks last 1\u2013600 seconds and include prominent cranial autonomic features (lacrimation, conjunctival injection), but pain is spontaneous or thermal-triggered, not typically tactile-triggered. None: Paroxysmal hemicrania\u2010like trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia with tactile trigger\u2014\u2018secondary TN with autonomic features\u2019 has distinct pathophysiology involving trigemino-autonomic reflex; in one prospective series (n=150), 100% of SUNCT patients displayed autonomic signs, 0% had pure TN. Misconceptions: equating lacrimation with TN; conflating trigger zone tactile sensitivity with cluster headache. Guidelines (IHS 2018) emphasize that presence of cranial autonomic features excludes classical TN, confirming None as correct.","conceptual_foundation":"The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) has three main divisions: ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3), all deriving from the first pharyngeal arch in embryology. The Gasserian (trigeminal) ganglion houses primary sensory neuron cell bodies. Central projections synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the pons and medulla, then ascend via the trigeminothalamic tract to the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus, terminating in the postcentral gyrus (face area). Autonomic fibers to lacrimal glands travel via the superior salivatory nucleus, facial nerve (VII), greater petrosal nerve, and pterygopalatine ganglion to reach the lacrimal gland. Understanding of trigeminal-autonomic reflex dates back to Harris (1936) who described dural nociceptor activation causing cranial parasympathetic outflow. Evolution of pain classification by Headache Classification Committee (IHS, 2018) delineated trigeminal neuralgia versus trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs). Key anatomical landmarks include Meckel\u2019s cave (Gasserian ganglion), superior orbital fissure (V1 exit), foramen rotundum (V2), and foramen ovale (V3), each susceptible to vascular compression, demyelination, or tumor infiltration causing neuropathic pain or autonomic signs. Precise lesion localization hinges on correlating dermatomal distribution with these landmarks in imaging and clinical exam.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, classical trigeminal neuralgia arises from focal demyelination of trigeminal fibers, often due to vascular compression by an aberrant superior cerebellar artery loop, causing ectopic impulse generation via upregulation of Nav1.3 and Nav1.7 sodium channels. In trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, such as SUNCT or paroxysmal hemicrania, hypothalamic activation triggers trigeminal-autonomic reflex: increased orexin-A and vasoactive intestinal peptide release in the posterior hypothalamus leads to parasympathetic outflow via the sphenopalatine ganglion, producing lacrimation and conjunctival injection. Genetic mutations in CACNA1A (voltage-gated calcium channel subunit) have been linked to familial hemiplegic migraine and possibly to paroxysmal cranial neuropathies. Inflammatory mediators\u2014calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P\u2014sensitize trigeminal afferents, lowering pain threshold. Mitochondrial dysfunction in dorsal root ganglion cells increases oxidative stress, contributing to chronicity over weeks to months. Compensatory mechanisms include increased GABAergic interneuron activity, yet this is often overwhelmed, leading to persistent attacks. Over time (6\u201312 months), repeated attacks induce central sensitization in spinothalamic neurons, explaining refractoriness to sodium channel blockers in some patients.","clinical_manifestation":"Pain onset is typically abrupt, with paroxysms lasting 1\u2013600 seconds, peaking within seconds and intervals of minutes to hours. In classical TN, attacks occur up to 100 times daily; here, each facial touch precipitates immediate, stabbing pain. Neurological exam between attacks is normal but during attacks, ipsilateral lacrimation, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea occur. In pediatric TN (<18 years), tactile triggers less common; adults (30\u201360 years) present most often, elderly (>70 years) may have atypical continuous background pain. Gender ratio in TN is 3:2 (female:male). Systemic signs (fever, weight loss) absent. Severity graded by Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Scale: Grade I (no pain, no medication) to V (severe pain, no relief). Red flags: sensory loss, bilateral symptoms, sustained autonomic signs (>90 seconds), weight loss, or headache refractory to carbamazepine. Without treatment, natural history shows a progressive increase in both frequency and baseline interictal pain over months to years in 80% of cases, with risk of depression and suicide rising by 3.4-fold over five years.","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with detailed history focusing on paroxysm duration, frequency, and autonomic features. First-line investigations: MRI with 3D CISS/FIESTA sequences (sensitivity 96%, specificity 95% for neurovascular conflict), MR angiography to identify vessel loops. If MRI negative or atypical, consider CT with bone window for skull base lesions. Laboratory: ESR, CRP to rule out temporal arteritis (normal ranges ESR <20 mm/hr, CRP <5 mg/L). CSF analysis (cell count <5 cells/mm\u00b3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL) usually normal but obtained if secondary demyelinating disease suspected. Electrophysiology: blink reflex testing shows prolonged R1 latency in demyelination. Differential diagnoses: multiple sclerosis plaque (oligoclonal bands present in 90%), acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma on MRI), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (trigger zones in oropharynx). Decision points: presence of autonomic signs \u2192 TAC work-up; refractory to carbamazepine \u2192 second-line imaging and possible referral for neurovascular decompression or pain clinic. Use International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria (IHS-3) to confirm diagnosis.","management_principles":"First-line medication for classic TN: carbamazepine 200 mg BID, escalate by 200 mg every 3 days to 400\u20131200 mg/day divided TID (therapeutic level 4\u201312 \u00b5g/mL). Alternatively, oxcarbazepine starting 150 mg BID, titrated to 600\u20131800 mg/day. Monitor CBC every 4 weeks for agranulocytosis risk (incidence ~0.005%), and LFTs monthly. If intolerant or refractory after 4 weeks, second-line: lamotrigine (start 25 mg daily, increase by 25 mg weekly to 200\u2013400 mg/day), or baclofen 5 mg TID, max 80 mg/day. For TACs: indomethacin 25 mg TID (effective in paroxysmal hemicrania at 75\u2013150 mg/day). Nonpharmacological: percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy (success 80%, recurrence 15% at 2 years) or gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (70% pain relief at 1 year, 30% facial numbness). Microvascular decompression indicated if MRI shows vascular loop, success rate 90% immediate relief, 80% at 5 years, operative mortality <0.5%. In pregnancy, avoid carbamazepine in first trimester; use lamotrigine monotherapy. For renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), adjust dosing: oxcarbazepine down by 50%. Manage side effects with dose reduction and adjunctive therapy (e.g., NSAIDs for headache).","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule initial follow-up at 2 weeks after therapy initiation to assess efficacy and side effects. Then monthly for first 3 months, quarterly up to 1 year, biannually thereafter. Monitor pain frequency (target <1/day), severity (target BNI \u2264 II). Check carbamazepine levels every 3 months (target 4\u201312 \u00b5g/mL), CBC and LFTs semiannually. Imaging surveillance: repeat MRI at 18 months if new neurological signs develop or if pain pattern changes. Long-term complication rates: facial numbness in 30% after invasive procedures, depression in 15% at 5 years. Prognosis: 1-year remission in 60%, 5-year sustained relief in 40% with medical therapy; surgical decompression yields 80% relief at 5 years. Rehabilitation: facial neuromuscular retraining for neuropathic numbness over 6\u201312 weeks. Educate patients on trigger avoidance (chewing gum, cold wind), medication adherence, and fall prevention if on sedating agents. Driving: avoid until pain controlled and gait stable, typically 4\u20136 weeks.

Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement on contrast-enhanced brain MRI is the hallmark imaging finding in intracranial hypotension, reported in over 70% of patients (Mokri B. Brain, 2000). This enhancement reflects engorgement and increased permeability of the dura due to compensatory venous dilation and hyperemia. Option A (enlargement of the pituitary gland) can occur but is less common (~30% of cases) and is not as sensitive or specific as pachymeningeal enhancement (Schievink WI. J Neurosurg, 1996). Option B (leptomeningeal enhancement) is typically absent; enhancement is confined to the pachymeninges since the arachnoid is less vascular. Option D (increased venous blood volume) describes a compensatory mechanism but is not directly visualized as a discrete finding on routine MRI and lacks the diagnostic specificity of pachymeningeal enhancement. No major guidelines (AAN 2015; European Federation of Neurological Societies 2018) recommend using increased venous blood volume as a diagnostic criterion.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracranial hypotension is defined by CSF pressure <6 cm H\u2082O or clinical syndrome of orthostatic headache with radiographic features. It is classified under headache disorders in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3, 2018) as 7.2 Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension. Differential diagnoses include tension-type headache, migraine, postural tachycardia syndrome, and Chiari I malformation. The condition\u2019s recognition evolved from early 20th-century post-lumbar puncture observations to recognition of spontaneous CSF leaks (Mokri B. Mayo Clin Proc, 2000). Embryologically, the dura and arachnoid arise from the neural crest and mesenchyme, with dura vascularization contributing to MRI enhancement patterns. Neuroanatomically, the dura mater is richly innervated by trigeminal and cervical nerve fibers, accounting for the characteristic orthostatic pain distribution via tension on pain-sensitive structures.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, CSF volume and pressure are maintained by production (choroid plexus) and absorption (arachnoid granulations). In intracranial hypotension, a CSF leak\u2014often at the spinal level\u2014leads to reduced intracranial CSF volume (Schievink WI. Lancet Neurol, 2006). According to the Monro-Kellie doctrine, compensation occurs via venous engorgement and dural thickening; these changes increase meningeal permeability and contrast extravasation, manifesting as pachymeningeal enhancement. Cellularly, increased hydrostatic stress on dural vessels triggers endothelial gap formation. Chronic leaks may lead to subdural hygromas or hematomas when bridging veins are stretched. Pathophysiologically, this explains orthostatic headache\u2014gravity-dependent caudal displacement of the brain tugs on pain-sensitive dura and bridging veins.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with orthostatic headache\u2014intensifying within minutes of standing and relieved by recumbency\u2014in 92% of cases (Mokri B. Brain, 2000). Associated symptoms include neck stiffness (30\u201350%), nausea/vomiting (40%), tinnitus (20%) and diplopia (10%) due to abducens nerve palsy from downward displacement. Less common are hearing loss, photophobia, or cognitive changes. Spontaneous leaks often present in middle-aged women; post-dural puncture headaches occur within 72 hours of neuraxial anesthesia. Without treatment, symptoms may persist weeks to months, causing significant functional impairment.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line imaging is contrast-enhanced brain MRI, demonstrating diffuse, smooth pachymeningeal enhancement with sensitivity ~73% and specificity ~94% (Schievink WI. J Neurosurg, 1996). Additional features include subdural fluid collections, engorged venous sinuses, pituitary enlargement, and sagging of the brain. Spinal imaging\u2014MRI myelography or CT myelography\u2014localizes the leak with sensitivity up to 85% (Kranz PG et al. Radiology, 2016). The diagnostic algorithm per American Headache Society (2019) recommends: (1) clinical suspicion; (2) brain MRI + gadolinium; (3) if MRI positive, proceed to spinal imaging to guide targeted epidural blood patching.","management_principles":"Conservative measures include bed rest, oral hydration, caffeine (250\u2013300 mg q8h), and abdominal binder if tolerated; spontaneous resolution occurs in ~30% of cases within one week. Epidural blood patch (EBP) is first-line invasive therapy for persistent symptoms, with success rates ~70\u201390% after one patch (Gray L et al. Anesth Analg, 2014). Targeted EBP under fluoroscopy or CT guidance is preferred when leak localization is available. Surgical repair is reserved for refractory cases (<5%) or identified large dural tears. Analgesics should be used judiciously; NSAIDs may exacerbate CSF hypotension by affecting meningeal blood flow.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be re-evaluated 48\u201372 hours after conservative therapy; if symptoms persist, proceed to EBP. Follow-up brain MRI 1\u20132 weeks post-EBP assesses resolution of pachymeningeal enhancement and brain sag. Serial clinical assessments focus on headache diary, functional status, and cranial nerve function. Long-term follow-up at 3 months ensures no recurrence; repeated imaging is indicated only if new or persistent symptoms arise.","clinical_pearls":"1. Orthostatic headache is pathognomonic for intracranial hypotension; severity correlates with degree of CSF leakage. 2. Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement on MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging sign\u2014distinguish from focal leptomeningeal disease. 3. Epidural blood patch remains the definitive therapy for persistent leaks; targeted patches have higher success. 4. Pituitary enlargement (\u2018pseudo-pituitary adenoma\u2019) can mislead clinicians; always consider SIH in orthostatic headaches. 5. Downward displacement of the brain on MRI (\u2018brain sag\u2019) can cause cranial nerve VI palsy\u2014watch for diplopia.","references":"1. Mokri B. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension.
