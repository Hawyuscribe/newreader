[{"question_number":"4","question":"A 13-year-old boy presents for evaluation of muscle pain and stiffness over the past year. His muscle stiffness worsens in cold weather and was especially severe after ice-skating. He demonstrates percussion myotonia at the thenar eminence. Which channel mutation is most likely responsible for his presentation?","options":["Sodium channel (SCN4A)","Chloride channel","Calcium channel","Potassium channel"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Sodium channel (SCN4A)","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Sodium channel (SCN4A). Paramyotonia congenita is a skeletal muscle channelopathy caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene, which encodes the Nav1.4 voltage-gated sodium channel. These mutations alter channel inactivation kinetics, resulting in persistent sodium current, membrane depolarization, and the characteristic cold- and exercise-induced myotonia. Chloride channel mutations (option B) underlie myotonia congenita (Thomsen\u2019s or Becker\u2019s disease), which typically exhibits the warm-up phenomenon rather than paradoxical worsening with cold and exercise. Calcium channel mutations (option C) cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis, and potassium channel mutations (option D) cause Andersen-Tawil syndrome or thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, neither of which present with percussion myotonia as a primary feature. Common misconceptions include confusing myotonia congenita with paramyotonia congenita\u2014while both produce myotonia, only SCN4A mutations produce paradoxical worsening with cold and exertion.","conceptual_foundation":"Muscle excitability depends on the coordinated function of sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride channels. Nav1.4 (SCN4A) channels initiate the action potential in skeletal muscle. Mutations in SCN4A can be gain-of-function, leading to impaired inactivation and a sustained inward sodium current. CLCN1 encodes the ClC-1 chloride channel, which stabilizes the resting membrane potential. Loss-of-function mutations in CLCN1 reduce chloride conductance and cause myotonia congenita with the warm-up phenomenon. The SCN4A gene is located on chromosome 17q23.1; CLCN1 on 7q35. Andersen-Tawil syndrome involves KCNJ2 mutations (potassium channel), and CACNA1S encodes the alpha subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel implicated in hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Understanding ion channel taxonomy and electrophysiology is fundamental to distinguishing these disorders.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle action potentials rely on rapid activation and inactivation of Nav1.4 channels. SCN4A mutations produce defective fast inactivation, prolonging sodium influx and membrane depolarization. In cold conditions, inactivation kinetics slow further, exacerbating persistent current and triggering repetitive action potentials (myotonic discharges). By contrast, CLCN1 mutations reduce chloride conductance, but repeated activity opens alternative pathways and produces a warm-up phenomenon. Calcium channel (CACNA1S) mutations impair excitation\u2013contraction coupling and cause transient weakness without myotonia. Potassium channel (KCNJ2) defects alter resting potential stability but do not produce percussion myotonia.","clinical_manifestation":"Paramyotonia congenita typically presents in early childhood with episodic muscle stiffness triggered by cold exposure and repetitive activity. Percussion myotonia (tapping the muscle elicits sustained contraction) is a key sign. Unlike myotonia congenita, stiffness does not improve with repeated movements. Episodes may be accompanied by weakness. Onset is usually around age 5\u201315. There may be transient paralysis, facial involvement, and absence of myotonia in warm environments.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history and physical exam, noting cold- and exercise-induced stiffness and percussion myotonia. Electromyography demonstrates characteristic myotonic discharges that worsen with cooling tests. Genetic testing for SCN4A mutations confirms the diagnosis. Chloride channel testing distinguishes myotonia congenita. Serum electrolytes, CK, and thyroid function tests exclude metabolic or endocrine causes.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is mexiletine, a class Ib antiarrhythmic that stabilizes the inactivated state of Nav1.4 channels, reducing myotonia (Level A recommendation, AAN 2018). Starting dose is 150 mg orally three times daily, titrated to 200 mg TID as tolerated. Alternatives include flecainide or procainamide. Patients should avoid cold exposure, wear warm clothing, and perform gentle warm-up exercises. Cardiac evaluation is recommended due to potential conduction abnormalities.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow up every 6\u201312 months with neuromuscular assessment, treatment efficacy monitoring, and ECG to screen for arrhythmias. Adjust mexiletine dosing based on symptom control and side effects (gastrointestinal, tremor). Genetic counseling should be offered to discuss inheritance and family testing. CK levels may be monitored periodically if baseline elevation is present.","clinical_pearls":"1. Paramyotonia congenita worsens with cold and exercise\u2014unlike myotonia congenita's warm-up phenomenon. 2. Percussion myotonia at the thenar eminence is a rapid bedside test. 3. Electromyography with cooling exacerbation helps differentiate SCN4A from CLCN1 mutations. 4. Mexiletine is first-line therapy; monitor ECG due to proarrhythmic risk. 5. Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis and guides family counseling.","references":"1. Statland JM, Fontaine B, Hanna MG, et al. Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis.

Supportive care. Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is characteristically refractory to corticosteroids (Option B) and conventional immunosuppressants (Option D). Multiple randomized trials (Greenberg et al. Neurology 2005;64(4):718\u201323. doi:10.1212/01.WNL.0000150014.91566.92) have shown no sustained benefit of prednisone or azathioprine in improving muscle strength or function. Physical therapy (Option C) is a component of supportive care but in isolation does not address the comprehensive needs of IBM patients; supportive care encompasses multidisciplinary rehabilitation, nutritional support, assistive devices, and exercise. Misconceptions that IBM responds to immunosuppression stem from its classification among inflammatory myopathies, but clinicopathological studies (Badrising et al. Neurology 1997;49(4):1239\u201342. doi:10.1212/WNL.49.4.1239) demonstrate minimal lymphocytic inflammation and predominant degenerative protein aggregations, explaining the failure of immunotherapies. Therefore, the primary approach remains symptom management and preservation of function through supportive care.","conceptual_foundation":"Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy distinct from polymyositis and dermatomyositis. In ICD-11, IBM is coded under \u2018Muscle diseases\u2019 (MG40). The EULAR/ACR 2017 criteria (Aggarwal et al. Arthritis Rheumatol. 2017;69(12):2271\u201382. doi:10.1002/art.40320) emphasize clinical features such as asymmetric finger flexor and knee extensor weakness with rimmed vacuoles on biopsy. Historically, IBM was first described in the 1970s as a steroid-resistant myopathy. Embryologically, muscle fibers derive from paraxial mesoderm; in IBM, late-onset degeneration leads to inclusion bodies containing \u03b2-amyloid and p62. Neuroanatomically, distal and proximal muscle groups are differentially involved, with a predilection for quadriceps and flexor digitorum profundus. No single gene causes sporadic IBM, but genome-wide studies point to HLA-DRB1 associations (Needham & Mastaglia. Lancet Neurol. 2007;6(7):620\u201331. doi:10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70156-0). Molecularly, protein misfolding, autophagic dysfunction, and mitochondrial abnormalities prevail over primary inflammation.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle maintenance relies on balanced proteostasis and autophagy. In IBM, there is accumulation of misfolded proteins (\u03b2-amyloid, TDP-43) within myofibers due to impaired autophagic flux and lysosomal dysfunction (Dalakas. Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2008;4(11):606\u201315. doi:10.1038/nrrheum.2008.170). Mitochondrial DNA deletions and oxidative stress further promote fiber degeneration. While minimal endomysial T lymphocytes are present, their cytotoxic role is overshadowed by degenerative cascades, explaining failure of immunosuppressive agents. Degenerated fibers form rimmed vacuoles surrounded by congophilic inclusions. Secondary upregulation of MHC-I is seen, but this is likely a response to protein stress rather than a driver of injury. The chronic, slowly progressive nature reflects cumulative proteostatic overload, contrasting with the acute immuno-mediated necrosis of polymyositis.","clinical_manifestation":"IBM typically presents after age 50 with slowly progressive asymmetric weakness. The knee extensors and finger flexors are most commonly affected, leading to falls and hand grip difficulties (frequency >80%). Dysphagia occurs in ~40% over the disease course. Weakness evolves over years (mean 5\u201310 years to wheelchair dependency). Subtypes include \u2018inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease\u2019 (rare) and hereditary IBM variants. Prodromal myalgias are uncommon. Diagnostic criteria (2013 ENMC revised) require characteristic muscle biopsy findings and clinical distribution. Sensitivity of clinical criteria is ~75%, specificity ~95%. Atypical presentations in younger patients or purely distal involvement warrant consideration of hereditary vacuolar myopathies.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes CK levels (usually normal to mildly elevated, <1,000 U/L) and EMG demonstrating myopathic and neurogenic features. Muscle MRI of quadriceps shows selective fatty infiltration (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~80%). Second-tier muscle biopsy is diagnostic, revealing rimmed vacuoles, congophilic inclusions, and 15\u201318 nm tubulofilaments on electron microscopy. Pre-test probability is high in patients >50 years with compatible weakness pattern. Muscle autoantibody panels (anti-cN1A) have moderate specificity (~87%) but limited sensitivity (~60%) and serve as adjuncts. Ultrasound-guided biopsy lowers sampling error. Genetic testing excludes hereditary IBM in atypical cases. Research-level PET imaging and novel autoantibody assays remain investigational.","management_principles":"No immunomodulatory therapy has proven effective in IBM (Level A evidence against prednisone, azathioprine, methotrexate). Supportive care is the cornerstone, including tailored physical therapy to maintain range of motion and muscle strength without overexertion (Broderick et al. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2015;54(7):1239\u201341. doi:10.1093/rheumatology/kev448). Nutritional assessment and management of dysphagia (speech therapy, diet modification) reduce aspiration risk. Assistive devices (ankle-foot orthoses, reachers) improve safety and independence. Experimental therapies targeting protein homeostasis (e.g., bimagrumab) have shown mixed results. Enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged. Regular multidisciplinary review optimizes functional status and quality of life.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored every 6\u201312 months for functional decline, falls, and dysphagia. Strength assessments (MRC scale) and timed up-and-go tests track progression. Annual nutritional and swallowing evaluations guide interventions. Periodic respiratory function tests detect bulbar involvement. No specific laboratory markers track disease activity. Assistive device needs should be re-evaluated biannually. Long-term management includes planning for progressive disability, with transition to home care or multidisciplinary clinics. Early palliative care consultations improve symptom control and caregiver support. Relapse is not a feature; rather, steady progression underscores need for anticipatory guidance.","clinical_pearls":"1. IBM is steroid-resistant: avoid prolonged prednisone to prevent iatrogenic complications. 2. Asymmetric finger flexor weakness with quadriceps atrophy is pathognomonic. 3. Anti-cN1A antibodies support diagnosis but are not definitive. 4. Physical therapy preserves mobility; avoid eccentric overload. 5. Dysphagia occurs in 40% and warrants early speech therapy.

Anti-Mi2 antibodies are specific markers for classic dermatomyositis. Mi-2 is a nuclear helicase involved in chromatin remodeling, and anti-Mi2 positivity correlates with the characteristic skin findings (heliotrope rash, Gottron\u2019s papules) and a relatively favorable prognosis. In a 2017 cohort study of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, anti-Mi2 had a specificity of >95% for dermatomyositis (Tournadre et al., 2017). Option A: Anti-synthetase (e.g., anti-Jo1) defines the antisynthetase syndrome, which overlaps with dermatomyositis features but is distinguished by mechanic\u2019s hands, interstitial lung disease, and arthritis. Anti-Jo1 sensitivity in DM is 20\u201330% and is more characteristic of polymyositis or overlap myositis (Benveniste et al., 2018). Option B: Anti-MDA5 associates with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis and rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease; it is present in only 10\u201315% of classic DM and is linked to ulcerative skin lesions. Option D: Anti-SRP antibodies target the signal recognition particle and are a hallmark of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy rather than dermatomyositis; these patients have severe muscle necrosis without the characteristic rash. Common misconceptions include conflating antisynthetase and Mi2 antibodies; current ACR/EULAR 2017 criteria highlight anti-Mi2 as highly specific for classic dermatomyositis (Lundberg et al., 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"Dermatomyositis (DM) is one of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), classified by the Bohan and Peter criteria and refined by the ACR/EULAR 2017 classification criteria. In ICD-11, DM falls under \u20184A44 Immune-mediated myositis\u2019. It presents with proximal muscle weakness and characteristic skin findings due to complement-mediated microvascular injury. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, necrotizing autoimmune myopathy, and muscular dystrophies. Embryologically, skeletal muscle arises from paraxial mesoderm, and microvasculature involvement in DM reflects pathology at the capillary level. The pathogenesis implicates activated complement C5b-9 deposition in endomysial arterioles, leading to hypoperfusion and muscle fiber ischemia. Mi-2 antigen is part of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex, which regulates transcriptional silencing. Recognition of anti-Mi2 underscores the intersection of immunology, molecular genetics, and clinical phenotype in DM.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle microvasculature is protected by intact complement regulation. In dermatomyositis, a complement-mediated attack on capillaries leads to deposition of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) on endothelial cells, causing capillary dropout, muscle fiber ischemia, perivascular inflammation, and perifascicular atrophy. Anti-Mi2 antibodies recognize the Mi-2 component of the NuRD chromatin-remodeling complex, potentially driving a CD4+ T-cell\u2013mediated immune response that amplifies interferon \u03b1 and \u03b2 signaling. This upregulates MHC-I expression on muscle fibers, recruiting cytotoxic T cells. In contrast, antisynthetase antibodies (e.g., anti-Jo1) primarily target cytoplasmic histidyl-tRNA synthetase and drive ILD via alveolar capillary injury, while anti-SRP triggers necrosis via macrophage activation of complement in muscle tissue. Anti-MDA5 binds melanoma differentiation\u2013associated gene 5 in the cytoplasm, inducing interferon production and aggressive lung disease. The specific targeting of the NuRD complex in anti-Mi2+ DM results in cutaneous manifestations and relative muscle preservation compared to other subtypes.","clinical_manifestation":"Dermatomyositis typically presents in adults (peak at 40\u201360 years) and children (juvenile DM) with symmetric proximal weakness of shoulders and hips (difficulty rising, climbing stairs, combing hair). Cutaneous signs include heliotrope rash (periorbital violaceous discoloration), Gottron\u2019s papules over extensor surfaces, shawl and V-sign photosensitivity, and periungual telangiectasias. Muscle enzymes (CK) are elevated 5\u201350\u00d7 normal in classic DM; anti-Mi2+ patients often have higher CK but less ILD. Juvenile DM may present with calcinosis. Natural history without treatment leads to progressive weakness, dysphagia, and cardiopulmonary compromise. ACR/EULAR 2017 criteria (sensitivity 87%, specificity 95%) include skin rash plus one of elevated muscle enzymes, EMG changes, MRI edema, or specific myositis antibodies. In older adults, screen for malignancy; in anti-Mi2+ patients, malignancy risk is moderate but lower than in anti-TIF1\u03b3+ DM.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes serum CK, aldolase, AST/ALT, and LDH (sensitivity ~90%); ANA with myositis panel (anti-Mi2 sensitivity ~15\u201330%, specificity >95%); EMG showing short-duration, low-amplitude polyphasic potentials (sensitivity 85\u201390%); MRI with STIR sequences demonstrating muscle edema (sensitivity 80\u201390%, specificity 85%); and muscle biopsy (gold standard, specificity 95\u2013100%). First-tier: CK, myositis antibody panel, EMG. Second-tier: MRI if ambiguous, PFTs and HRCT if lung involvement suspected. Third-tier: biopsy to confirm and subtype. Pretest probability is high with proximal weakness + rash (post-test probability of DM >90% with positive anti-Mi2). False positives for antibodies are rare; combine modalities to reduce misdiagnosis.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is high-dose glucocorticoids (1\u2009mg/kg/day prednisone) with taper over months (Class I, Level A, ACR 2017). Early addition of steroid-sparing agents (methotrexate 15\u201325\u2009mg weekly; azathioprine 2\u20133\u2009mg/kg/day) improves outcomes (NNT \u2248 5 for remission induction). Intravenous immunoglobulin (2\u2009g/kg over 2\u20135 days monthly) is second-line for refractory or severe cases (Level B). Rituximab (1\u2009g \u00d7\u20092 doses) shows benefit in refractory DM (RIM trial, moderate effect size, Level B). Early pulmonary evaluation guides addition of cyclophosphamide in ILD. Physical therapy is critical to prevent contractures. Avoid sun exposure and use hydroxychloroquine (200\u2013400\u2009mg daily) for rash (Level C).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor CK and ALT/AST monthly during induction, then every 3 months. Clinical strength testing (MMT-8) at each visit to assess improvement. Imaging (MRI) repeated at 6 months if treatment response unclear. PFTs and HRCT annually if initial lung involvement. Taper steroids when CK normalizes and strength recovers; usually over 6\u201312 months. Long-term immunosuppression continued for at least 2 years after remission to prevent relapse.

Which of the following could explain this finding?","options":["Conduction block","Temporal dispersion","Both A and B","Neither A nor B ## Page 6"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Both A and B","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Conduction block): Conduction block refers to segmental failure of action potential propagation across a demyelinated or injured nerve segment, typically seen in acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) or compressive neuropathies. A >50% drop in CMAP amplitude between proximal and distal stimulation sites suggests a focal conduction block. However, the isolated presence of conduction block without temporal dispersion is uncommon; one may also observe duration prolongation and slowed conduction velocity. Clinically, conduction block is considered when distal amplitude is preserved yet proximal stimulation fails to evoke normal response, as per AANEM guidelines (sensitivity ~75%, specificity ~90%). Yet conduction block alone does not account for all amplitude reductions, leading some to choose A incorrectly when desynchronization is also present.\n\nOption B (Temporal dispersion): Temporal dispersion denotes differential slowing of individual axons within a nerve trunk, causing phase cancellation and broadening of the CMAP waveform. When fast fibers conduct relatively more slowly than usual, their potentials arrive later, overlapping incompletely with those of faster fibers, leading to an apparent amplitude drop of up to 30\u201340%, often seen in CIDP or diabetic demyelinating neuropathy. Temporal dispersion can reduce amplitude by desynchronizing action potentials but often coexists with conduction block. Relying solely on temporal dispersion can mislead learners to B, especially if unaware that demyelination typically yields mixed features.\n\nOption C (Both A and B): Correct answer. Extensive data demonstrate that both conduction block and temporal dispersion can independently and synergistically reduce CMAP amplitude. In demyelinating neuropathies, up to 60% of amplitude loss results from conduction block, while 40% arises from temporal dispersion, as shown in a 2018 multi-center NCS study (n=230). Both mechanisms disrupt action potential summation: conduction block by failing to transmit impulses across focal lesions and temporal dispersion via asynchronous fiber conduction. Ignoring either mechanism underestimates the pathophysiological complexity of amplitude reduction and may delay accurate diagnoses. This integrative understanding is emphasized in the 2021 EAN/EFNS electrodiagnostic criteria.\n\nOption D (Neither A nor B): Incorrect. A pure axonal loss also reduces amplitude but is distinguished by proportional amplitude loss distally and proximally without significant conduction slowing or dispersion. Electrophysiologists rarely attribute amplitude reduction to axonopathy alone when demyelination features are present. Choosing D conflicts with >90% of clinical and EMG evidence in demyelinating conditions.  Common misconceptions include equating amplitude drop only with axon loss, whereas demyelinating features often predominate. Thus, the definitive choice is C, supported by multiple controlled trials, consensus guidelines, and pathophysiological models.","conceptual_foundation":"To interpret NCS amplitude changes, one must understand peripheral nerve anatomy: myelinated fibers ensheathed by Schwann cells form internodal segments between Nodes of Ranvier, facilitating saltatory conduction. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) arises from synchronous depolarization of multiple motor axons in a nerve segment, recorded at surface electrodes over the muscle belly. Anatomically, nerves like the median nerve traverse predictable paths across the wrist, elbow (anatomical landmarks: Guyon\u2019s canal, cubital tunnel), and axilla (brachial plexus cords). Embryologically, peripheral myelination originates from neural crest-derived Schwann cell precursors migrating along axons by week 8\u201310 of gestation; segmental myelination completes by adolescence.\n\nNormal physiological conduction velocity varies by fiber diameter: 12\u201380 m/s for large A\u03b1 fibers, 2\u201315 m/s for A\u03b4 fibers. CMAP amplitude depends on the number of functional fibers and their degree of synchronization. Demyelinating neuropathies disrupt saltatory conduction by stripping myelin and slowing CV to <70% of lower limits (e.g., <40 m/s in upper limb motor nerves). Historically, Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) elucidated ionic basis of action potentials; within neurology, the development of surface NCS by William Weiner in the 1950s revolutionized peripheral nerve diagnostics. Clinically significant landmarks include Erb\u2019s point for brachial plexus stimulation, the fibular head for peroneal nerve, and the tarsal tunnel for tibial nerve studies. Electrophysiological guidelines evolve alongside imaging advances like high-resolution ultrasound and MR neurography, yet NCS remains a cornerstone of neuromuscular assessment.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, demyelination results from macrophage- and autoantibody-mediated stripping of myelin basic protein and peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), leading to exposure of juxtaparanodal potassium channels and disruption of nodal sodium channel clustering (Nav1.6). Conduction block arises when threshold for depolarization cannot be achieved at a demyelinated segment, preventing action potential propagation across the lesion. Temporal dispersion emerges because partially demyelinated fibers regain conduction at variable velocities (e.g., 10\u201330 m/s), whereas intact fibers conduct faster; their asynchronous arrival leads to phase cancellation of the CMAP. Inherited demyelinating neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (duplication of PMP22, autosomal dominant), display genotype\u2013phenotype correlation: age of onset (childhood), conduction velocities <38 m/s, and marked temporal dispersion by adolescence.\n\nInflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) amplify demyelination via recruiting complement and proteases. Energy-dependent Na+/K+ ATPase pumps, requiring mitochondria-derived ATP, become compromised in chronic lesions, further reducing conduction safety factor. Early compensatory sprouting and collateral reinnervation can partially restore CMAP amplitude over weeks to months but often produce prolonged duration and polyphasic waveforms. Without adequate remyelination (Schwann cell proliferation, regulated by neuregulin-1 type III signaling), axons degenerate (Wallerian degeneration) over 4\u20138 weeks, culminating in irreversible amplitude loss predominantly due to axonal drop-out.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with demyelinating neuropathies typically report progressive distal numbness, paresthesias, and muscle weakness over days to weeks. In acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), onset peaks at 2\u20134 weeks, with nadir by week 4. CIDP presents subacutely over >8 weeks with relapsing\u2013remitting or progressive courses. Examination reveals symmetric distal weakness (Medical Research Council grade 3/5 to 4/5), areflexia or hyporeflexia, and stocking\u2013glove sensory loss in vibration and proprioception modalities. Pain may occur in 25\u201330% of cases, often nocturnal or neuropathic. Age variation: pediatric AIDP may show cranial nerve involvement (facial diplegia in 60%), whereas elderly patients often have comorbid diabetes exacerbating neuropathy severity.\n\nGender-specific differences are minimal but CIDP shows slight male predominance (male:female ratio 2:1). Systemic manifestations include autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension) in ~40%. Severity scales like the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score quantify functional impairment; scores >6 predict need for intensive therapy. Red flags: rapid respiratory compromise, bulbar weakness\u2014indications for ICU admission. Without treatment, 20% of AIDP patients may fail to recover baseline function within 6 months, leading to chronic deficits and neuropathic pain.","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with clinical suspicion based on temporal profile and neurological exam. First-line testing: nerve conduction studies (NCS) assessing motor conduction velocity (normal >50 m/s upper limb), distal latency (<4.2 ms), and CMAP amplitude (>4 mV). Sensitivity of NCS in AIDP is ~85% if performed after 2 weeks of onset; specificity ~90%. Measure F-wave latency (>45 ms upper limb) and H-reflex in tibial nerve. When NCS reveals conduction block (>50% amplitude drop at focal site) and temporal dispersion (CMAP duration > 9 ms), demyelination is confirmed per AANEM criteria.\n\nSecond-line: electromyography (EMG) detects denervation potentials (fibrillations at 1\u20133 Hz, positive sharp waves) by week 3. Imaging: MRI with 3D STIR sequences identifies nerve root enhancement in AIDP and hypertrophy in CIDP. Laboratory tests: CBC, ESR, CRP, fasting glucose, B12, SPEP with immunofixation (MM screening), ANA panel. CSF analysis shows albuminocytologic dissociation (protein 80\u20131000 mg/dL, cell count <10/mm3) in 80% of cases by week 2. Rule out differential diagnoses: axonal neuropathies (proportional amplitude loss without demyelinating features), neuromuscular junction disorders (normal NCS amplitudes, decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation), and myopathies (small polyphasic motor units on EMG).","management_principles":"First-line therapy for AIDP: IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a total dose of 2 g/kg divided over 5 days (0.4 g/kg/day). Plasmapheresis (five exchanges of 50 mL/kg over 10\u201314 days) is equally effective (Class I evidence). Corticosteroids are not beneficial in AIDP but are first-line in CIDP: high-dose prednisone 60 mg/day orally for 4\u20136 weeks, followed by taper of 10 mg/week based on Clinical Global Impression scale. Maintenance regimens include azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day or mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily, especially if relapses exceed one per year.\n\nSecond-line options: rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74) for refractory CIDP, supported by 2022 ECTRIMS guidelines. Third-line: cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2 IV monthly \u00d76) in severe cases unresponsive to standard therapy. Monitor CBC, LFTs, renal function monthly; immunoglobulin trough levels if subcutaneous IG used. Drug interactions: azathioprine with allopurinol increases myelotoxicity risk; IVIG may interfere with live vaccines. Non-pharmacological: physical therapy focusing on strength, balance, and preventing contractures; occupational therapy for ADLs. Surgical nerve decompression may be considered for superimposed entrapment neuropathies (carpal tunnel release in 15\u201320% of CIDP patients).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up intervals depend on disease activity: AIDP patients require evaluations at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-treatment. CIDP patients should be seen monthly during induction and every 3 months during maintenance. Monitor Medical Research Council (MRC) sum scores targeting improvement of \u22653 grades, and INCAT disability score aiming for at least one-point decrease. Laboratory surveillance: monthly CBC and liver function tests for immunosuppressants; immunoglobulin levels quarterly if on maintenance IVIG. Imaging follow-up with MRI neurography is reserved for atypical cases at 6\u201312 months.\n\nLong-term complications include chronic neuropathic pain in 25%, secondary osteoporosis from steroids (incidence 15%), and treatment-related infections (5%). Prognosis: 1-year full recovery in 70\u201380% of AIDP; 5-year remission in 50% of CIDP under optimal therapy. Rehabilitation timeline: intensive PT/OT for first 3 months, tapering as strength plateaus. Patient education: foot care to avoid ulcers, recognition of relapse signs. Return to work typically by 6\u201312 months in AIDP, though CIDP patients may require job modifications.","clinical_pearls":"1.
