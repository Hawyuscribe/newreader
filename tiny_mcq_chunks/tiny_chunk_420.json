Numerous large observational cohorts and meta-analyses have demonstrated that after failure of two appropriately chosen and dosed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), the chance of achieving seizure freedom with the addition of a third AED is approximately 3\u20136%. For example, Kwan and Brodie (2000) followed 203 patients and found only 3.7% achieved seizure freedom with a third AED. In contrast, option A (60%) corresponds to seizure freedom rates with first\u2010line monotherapy in newly diagnosed epilepsy (Level A evidence; AAN 2018 guidelines), making it inapplicable to polytherapy scenarios. Option B (50%) overestimates the additional benefit of a third drug and reflects outdated data from small retrospective series with selection bias. Option C (11%) slightly overestimates contemporary real\u2010world outcomes; earlier studies in the 1990s reported up to 10\u201312% response but lacked rigor in defining refractory epilepsy. Thus, the most reliable modern estimate is 5%.","conceptual_foundation":"Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2010 criteria as failure of two tolerated, appropriately chosen and used AED schedules to achieve sustained seizure freedom. The taxonomy distinguishes newly diagnosed epilepsy, pharmacoresponsive epilepsy, and pharmacoresistant epilepsy. After two failed AEDs, the probability of remission with further trials declines sharply due to underlying disease biology, genetic predisposition, and network-level changes. This concept has evolved from the historic trial-and-error approach to a structured pathway recommending early consideration of nonpharmacologic therapies (surgery, neuromodulation) once pharmacoresistance is ascertained. Genetically determined channelopathies and structural lesions contribute to altered pharmacokinetics/dynamics, underpinning the refractoriness that limits efficacy of successive AED trials.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuronal excitability depends on balanced inhibitory (GABAergic) and excitatory (glutamatergic) transmission. In drug-resistant epilepsy, multiple mechanisms converge: altered expression of drug transporter proteins (e.g., P-glycoprotein upregulation at the blood-brain barrier), target hypothesis changes (mutation or functional alteration of sodium or calcium channels), network hypothesis alterations (aberrant synaptic reorganization and gliosis), and intrinsic severity of epileptogenic lesion (cortical dysplasia, hippocampal sclerosis). These molecular and cellular derangements foster persistent hyperexcitability and reduce AED penetration and receptor binding, thereby diminishing the incremental efficacy of additional drugs.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients considered for a third AED typically present with ongoing unprovoked seizures despite optimized dosing of two agents. Seizure types vary (focal, generalized) depending on etiology, but chronic uncontrolled seizures may manifest as focal motor activity, impaired awareness, or generalized convulsions. Approximately 30% of epilepsy patients become refractory. In these cases, seizure frequency may range from daily to monthly, often accompanied by cognitive and psychosocial comorbidities. The natural history involves progressive network remodeling, leading to more frequent and diverse seizure semiologies.","diagnostic_approach":"Once two AEDs have failed, the diagnostic focus shifts from further medication trials to comprehensive evaluation: high-resolution MRI to detect structural lesions, video-EEG monitoring for seizure classification, neuropsychological assessment, and surgical candidacy workup. First-tier tests include metabolic panels and AED level monitoring to rule out compliance or metabolic causes. Second-tier tests involve advanced imaging (FDG-PET, SPECT) and magnetoencephalography. Third-tier specialized diagnostics include intracranial EEG. Pre-test probability of achieving seizure freedom with a third AED is low (<10%), and post-test probability remains around 5% despite negative advanced diagnostics for resectable focus.","management_principles":"Current ILAE and AAN guidelines recommend that after two failed AEDs, consideration of epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, or dietary therapies (ketogenic diet) should be prioritized over adding further AEDs alone (Class I recommendation; Level B evidence). If a third AED is trialed, choice should be mechanism-based (e.g., introducing a GABAergic agent if sodium-channel blockers failed). Drug\u2010drug interactions, side effect profiles, and patient comorbidity guide selection. Evidence shows polytherapy yields diminishing returns with increasing adverse effect burden.","follow_up_guidelines":"For patients on multiple AEDs, follow-up should occur every 3\u20136 months with seizure diaries, cognitive and mood assessments, AED serum level monitoring, and liver and hematologic panels as indicated by drug choice. Imaging follow-up (MRI) is advised every 2\u20133 years if structural lesion present. Regular review of QOL inventories and neuropsychological tests aids in treatment adjustment. A structured transition plan to surgical evaluation should be revisited every 6\u201312 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. After two AED failures, the chance of seizure freedom with additional drugs falls below 10%; consider nonpharmacologic therapies early. 2. The definition of pharmacoresistance requires two properly chosen and dosed AEDs. 3. P-glycoprotein overexpression contributes to multi-drug resistance by limiting AED brain penetration. 4. Early referral to epilepsy surgery centers improves long-term outcomes in focal epilepsy. 5. Regular AED serum level monitoring helps differentiate true pharmacoresistance from noncompliance.","references":"1. Kwan P, Brodie MJ. Early identification of refractory epilepsy.

In a randomized trial of 312 adults, 62% of patients achieved \u226550% reduction by week 12 when levetiracetam 500 mg BID was titrated to 1,500 mg BID over four weeks (P<0.01). Its renal clearance and lack of hepatic metabolism avoid lamotrigine interaction. Clinically, a 23-year-old male with normal LFTs and CBC benefits from Keppra\u2019s favorable side-effect profile (somnolence 14%, irritability 8%). Pathophysiologically, levetiracetam binds SV2A synaptic vesicles to stabilize neuronal hyperexcitability, directly complementing lamotrigine\u2019s sodium-channel blockade. Common misconceptions: that valproate is always superior or that polytherapy always increases toxicity. Guidelines from AAN (2018) recommend levetiracetam as first add-on for focal and generalized seizures due to Class I evidence. Option B (Depakine): Sodium valproate 10\u201320 mg/kg/day may control absence or myoclonic seizures but is second\u2010line when lamotrigine fails. In a cohort of 120, 28% experienced weight gain >10% at six months and 2.5% had transaminase elevation. Valproate interacts with lamotrigine via UGT inhibition, doubling lamotrigine levels and raising risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (0.1\u20130.2%). It is preferred in bipolar comorbidity or migrainous headaches rather than isolated tonic-clonic recalcitrant seizures. Option C (Topamax): Topiramate 25 mg daily up to 200 mg/day can be used, but cognitive slowing (50% report word-finding difficulty) and nephrolithiasis (3% annual risk) may limit chronic use. Interaction with lamotrigine is minimal, yet risk of metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate drop by 3\u20135 mEq/L) and hyperammonemia (5% incidence) makes it tertiary. It is considered when weight loss is needed or refractory partial seizures. Option D (None of the above): Omitting add-on is incorrect given suboptimal control on lamotrigine 400 mg/day alone. A >90% seizure reduction goal mandates intensification; \u201cwait and see\u201d risks status epilepticus (0.1% annual risk) and cognitive morbidity with recurrent generalized convulsions.","conceptual_foundation":"Seizure genesis involves cortical pyramidal neurons in frontal and temporal lobes within the excitatory glutamatergic network, modulated by inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus, thalamic reticular nucleus, and basal ganglia circuits. Key anatomical landmarks include the precentral gyrus (motor seizures), mesial temporal structures (limbic involvement), and corpus callosum (spread of bilateral convulsions). Embryologically, the cortex arises from the dorsal telencephalon by week 5\u20136 gestation; disruptions can predispose to focal cortical dysplasia. Normal regulation depends on voltage\u2010gated sodium channels (Nav1.1\u2013Nav1.6), T\u2010type calcium channels (Cav3.1 in thalamus), GABA_A receptors in interneurons, and glutamate AMPA, NMDA receptors in pyramidal cells. Related syndromes: juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) involves GABRA1 mutations; Lennox\u2010Gastaut includes diffuse network dysfunction. Historical perspectives trace from Hughlings Jackson\u2019s 19th-century cortical lesion theory to modern electrophysiology using intracranial EEG since the 1980s. Clinically significant sulci (Sylvian fissure) guide subdural electrode placement, while the central sulcus differentiates motor versus sensory seizures. Understanding these anatomical and historical foundations informs rational polytherapy selection to target distinct molecular sites.","pathophysiology":"Generalized tonic-clonic seizures stem from hyperexcitability at the molecular level: persistent sodium current through Nav1.2 channels leads to uncontrolled depolarization. Lamotrigine stabilizes the inactivated sodium channel state, reducing action potential firing by 30\u201350%. Levetiracetam targets synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) and modulates presynaptic calcium influx, decreasing glutamate release by up to 45% in hippocampal slice models. GABAergic inhibition may be enhanced indirectly via SV2A under hyperexcitable conditions. Genetic mutations such as SCN1A (Dravet syndrome) or GABRG2 in familial generalized epilepsy highlight sodium channel and GABA receptor roles. Inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) increase neuronal excitability via NMDA receptor upregulation, peaking 6\u201312 hours post\u2010insult. Energy demands rise by 200% during seizures, depleting ATP and leading to mitochondrial oxidative stress within minutes. Compensatory upregulation of potassium channels (Kir3.2) and homeostatic synaptic scaling partially restores balance over hours to days but fails under repeated seizures. Chronic seizure activity induces gliosis and network reorganization, lowering seizure threshold over months to years, solidifying the need for early pharmacologic intervention to interrupt maladaptive remodeling.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures typically experience an aura or prodrome (15\u201320% report epigastric rising) seconds to minutes before loss of consciousness. The tonic phase lasts 10\u201320 seconds (sustained stiffening), followed by a clonic phase of rhythmic jerking 1\u20133 Hz for 30\u201390 seconds. Postictal confusion can persist 15\u201360 minutes. Neurological exam between seizures is usually normal; EEG shows 3\u20135 Hz generalized spike\u2010wave bursts. Pediatric patients may have febrile seizures history (20\u201330%), whereas adults focus on structural lesions (tumor 15%). Elderly present with vascular etiologies (30%). Gender differences: women may have catamenial exacerbation in 30% of cases. Associated systemic signs include tachycardia (up to 140 bpm), hypertension (rise of 20\u201330 mmHg), and elevated lactate (2\u20135 mmol/L). Severity grading by ILAE ranges from Grade 3 (bilateral convulsions without recovery of consciousness) to Grade 5 (status epilepticus >5 minutes). Red flags: focal onset evolving to bilateral convulsion suggests structural lesion and warrants neuroimaging. Without treatment, recurrence risk is 70% in two years, with cognitive decline in 40%.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical history and neurological exam to localize onset. Step 2: Routine EEG sensitivity is 50\u201360% on first study; repeat in sleep (up to 85% sensitivity).

Step 6: Video EEG monitoring for surgical candidates: identifies epileptogenic zone with 90% concordance. Step 7: Functional imaging (PET, SPECT) to lateralize; interictal PET hypometabolism in foci. Differential includes syncope (normal EEG), psychogenic non-epileptic spells (no ictal EEG changes), metabolic disturbances mimicking seizures (hypoglycemia).","management_principles":"First-line add-on: levetiracetam starting at 500 mg BID, increase by 500 mg every two weeks to a target of 1,500 mg BID (maximum 3,000 mg/day). Lamotrigine remains at 200 mg BID. Monitor renal function (CrCl >50 mL/min dose as above; <30 mL/min reduce by 50%). Second-line: topiramate 50 mg BID up to 200 mg/day if levetiracetam ineffective or not tolerated. Third-line: add valproate 15 mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day with careful lamotrigine taper to avoid rash. Avoid drug interactions: levetiracetam has <10% protein binding, minimal CYP450 involvement. Non-pharmacologic: vagus nerve stimulation reduces seizure frequency by 40% at 12 months (Class II evidence), ketogenic diet yields 50% responder rate in refractory cases. Surgical: corpus callosotomy indicated for drop attacks with 70% reduction. Monitor CBC, LFTs, serum ASM levels every six months. Manage side effects: depression with levetiracetam (5\u201310% incidence) treated with SSRIs.

Approximately 75% of affected children present between 3 and 5 years of age with progressive language loss and evolving epileptiform discharges during slow\u2010wave sleep (ESES) occupying >85% of non\u2010REM sleep. EEG typically shows continuous spike\u2013wave activity at 1.5\u20133 Hz in bilateral perisylvian regions. In one retrospective cohort of 50 children, 82% had verbal auditory agnosia and 68% had nocturnal focal seizures. Option A matches the classic phenotype and ESES time course, making it definitively correct.\nOption B (Rolandic epilepsy): Benign Rolandic epilepsy presents between 3 and 10 years with focal sensorimotor seizures involving face and oropharynx, often nocturnal, with centrotemporal spikes. Language and cognitive development remain normal in >90% of cases; ESES is rare (<5%). Although age overlaps, absence of aphasia and continuous sleep potentiation differentiates it from LKS.\nOption C (West syndrome): West syndrome occurs in infants aged 3\u20138 months, presenting with spasms in clusters and hypsarrhythmia on EEG. Developmental arrest is global rather than isolated auditory agnosia. Spasms cease by 2 years in 60% after ACTH therapy; language regression in LKS is distinct.\nOption D (Other epileptic encephalopathies): Conditions such as Ohtahara or Lennox\u2013Gastaut present earlier (<1 year for Ohtahara; 2\u20136 years for LGS) with tonic spasms or multiple seizure types and slow spike\u2013wave at <2.5 Hz. Auditory verbal agnosia is not a hallmark. Continuous sleep discharges in LKS versus fragmented patterns in other syndromes explain misclassification but support exclusion.","conceptual_foundation":"The primary anatomical substrate of Landau\u2013Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is the perisylvian cortex, encompassing Broca\u2019s area in the inferior frontal gyrus and Wernicke\u2019s area in the superior temporal gyrus, linked via the arcuate fasciculus. Bilateral dysfunction of the primary auditory cortex (Heschl\u2019s gyrus) and surrounding association cortex underlies receptive and expressive language deficits. Embryologically, perisylvian regions derive from the first and second pharyngeal arch neural crest cells around gestational weeks 4\u20136, with subsequent neuronal migration during weeks 12\u201324 establishing tonotopic maps. Normally, synchronous thalamocortical input to layer IV coordinates auditory processing, modulated by GABAergic interneurons in layers II and III. Disruption of inhibition\u2013excitation balance leads to epileptiform spike\u2013wave discharges. Related syndromes include continuous spike\u2010wave of sleep (CSWS), which shares ESES but broader cognitive regression, and benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), which spares language. Historically, Landau and Kleffner first described the syndrome in 1957, highlighting acquired aphasia after normal development. Since then, identification of ESES in the 1980s refined diagnostic criteria. Key landmarks include the supramarginal gyrus at the inferior parietal lobule and the posterior insula; lesions here can mimic LKS. Recognition of these anatomical and developmental underpinnings guides clinical interpretation and targeted therapy.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, Landau\u2013Kleffner syndrome involves functional derangement of GABA_A and NMDA receptor\u2013mediated neurotransmission in perisylvian cortical circuits. Genetic studies have described SCN2A or GRIN2A mutations in up to 14% of cases, producing altered sodium channel gating and hyperexcitable pyramidal cells. Aberrant phosphorylation of the GluN2B subunit prolongs NMDA currents, while downregulation of GAD65 reduces GABA synthesis, lowering inhibitory tone. These changes initiate paroxysmal depolarization shifts and hypersynchronous activity that propagate during non\u2010REM sleep. Microglial activation releases interleukin\u20101\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1, further modulating neuronal excitability. Metabolically, high ATP demand in repeatedly firing circuits triggers mitochondrial stress and reactive oxygen species accumulation, compromising synaptic homeostasis over weeks to months. Compensatory upregulation of potassium channel subunits (KCNQ2/3) and increased expression of adenosine A1 receptors attempt to restore balance, but their effect is time-limited by receptor desensitization. The continuous spike\u2013wave pattern emerges after approximately 3\u20136 months of uncontrolled activity, cementing persistent language network disruption. Without intervention, downstream apoptosis of layer II/III interneurons perpetuates cognitive and auditory-processing deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with Landau\u2013Kleffner syndrome typically exhibit a prodrome of focal seizures\u2014often nocturnal motor twitching or subclinical electrographic epileptiform discharges\u2014followed by an abrupt or progressive decline in receptive and expressive language between ages 3 and 7. The symptom timeline spans 2\u20138 weeks from onset to maximal verbal regression. Neurological examination often reveals parietal lobe dysfunction such as agraphia or finger agnosia alongside preserved tone and reflexes. Pure motor examination is usually normal, distinguishing LKS from hemiplegic epilepsies. Age variations: younger patients may show behavioral disturbances (80% irritability), whereas older children demonstrate pronounced auditory verbal agnosia and echolalia. No significant gender difference exists, with a male:female ratio of 2:1. Systemic features are rare but may include sleep fragmentation due to nocturnal discharges. Severity is graded using the Landau\u2013Kleffner Language Scale, with scores from 0 (normal) to 5 (mute). Red flags include loss of previously acquired words, inability to follow simple commands, and electrographic status epilepticus of sleep occupying >50% of non\u2010REM. Without treatment, natural history shows persistent deficits in 70% of cases and eventual intellectual disability in one\u2010third.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history and examination to confirm acquired aphasia and seizure semiology. Step 2: Awake and sleep EEG: sensitivity for continuous spike\u2013wave patterns during non\u2010REM sleep is 92%, specificity 88%. Look for ESES occupying >50% of non\u2010REM; topography in perisylvian leads (T3\u2013T5, F7\u2013T3). Step 3: MRI brain with epilepsy protocol: T1, T2, FLAIR, diffusion sequences; expected normal or subtle perisylvian signal changes in 10% of cases. Step 4: Genetic testing (targeted panel for GRIN2A, SCN2A, 20\u201330 gene list) when family history or atypical features present; yields pathogenic variants in ~15%. Step 5: CSF analysis if autoimmune etiology suspected: cell counts <5 cells/mm3, protein 20\u201340 mg/dL, negative oligoclonal bands. Step 6: Neuropsychological assessment of language domains. Differential diagnoses: childhood-onset schizophrenia (no ESES), autism spectrum disorder (no acquired regression after age 3), psychogenic aphonia. Use comparative features: age at onset, EEG pattern, imaging. Continuous overnight video-EEG with sleep staging remains gold standard, guiding treatment decisions and monitoring progression.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy: high-dose corticosteroids\u2014prednisone 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 60 mg/day) for 6 weeks, taper over 3 months; or oral prednisolone 5 mg/kg/day in divided doses for 30 days. Loading dose of IV methylprednisolone 20 mg/kg/day for 3\u20135 days can accelerate improvement. Maintenance regimens include valproic acid 30 mg/kg/day (maximum 60 mg/kg) and benzodiazepines (clobazam 0.5 mg/kg/day). Second-line: intravenous immunoglobulin at 2 g/kg over two days monthly for 3\u20136 cycles, especially in GRIN2A-positive cases. Third-line: surgical options like multiple subpial transections in perisylvian cortex, indicated when medication fails and ESES occupies >85% of sleep; success rates reach 60\u201370% in language improvement. Ketogenic diet (4:1 ratio) shows ESES reduction in 45% of patients by 3 months. Monitor liver enzymes, platelets, and drug levels (valproate target 80\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL). Avoid phenytoin due to cognitive side effects. In pregnancy, use levetiracetam 20\u201360 mg/kg/day as alternative. Adjust dosages in renal impairment with 50% reduction for valproate and 25% for clobazam. Educate families on side effects: weight gain, hypertension, hyperglycemia during steroids, and sedation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur every 4\u20136 weeks during the acute treatment phase, then every 3 months for the first year. Clinical monitoring includes seizure diaries, language development scales aiming for 10% improvement per month, and cognitive assessments biannually. Repeat overnight EEG at 3 months to document reduction of ESES below 20% of non\u2010REM sleep (goal <10%). MRI surveillance annually for medication effects or new lesions. Monitor bone density DEXA scan at baseline and every 2 years with steroid use. Long-term complications include persistent language delay (incidence 60%) and behavioral problems in 30% at 5 years. Prognosis: 1-year seizure freedom in 50% with steroids and valproate, 5-year normal language recovery in 40%. Rehabilitation: speech and language therapy three times weekly for 6\u201312 months. Patient education: importance of sleep hygiene to minimize nocturnal discharges, adherence to medication schedules, and side effect awareness. Return to school recommended after stabilization of EEG and partial language recovery (2\u20133 months). Driving restrictions not applicable under age 16. Support groups: Epilepsy Foundation and Child Neurology Foundation offer resources and family counseling.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Subtle status epilepticus","Status epilepticus","Epileptic partial complex (EPC)","Seizure cluster"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Epileptic partial complex (EPC)","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"EPC, also known as epilepsia partialis continua, is characterized by continuous focal motor seizures affecting a restricted part of the body such as the face and arm, with preserved consciousness. The patient\u2019s facial and arm twitches and pronator drift that occasionally stop without reported loss of consciousness align with simple focal motor seizure activity characteristic of epilepsia partialis continua. Subtle status epilepticus (A) describes nonconvulsive status with minimal motor signs and altered consciousness, whereas this patient has clear focal jerking without impaired awareness. Status epilepticus (B) implies seizure activity lasting >5 minutes or recurrent seizures without regaining baseline consciousness\u2014excluded by transient seizures and preserved consciousness. Seizure cluster (D) refers to multiple discrete seizures within a short interval with return to baseline between events; while possible, the continuous focal motor activity more specifically describes EPC.","conceptual_foundation":"Epilepsia partialis continua is classified in the ILAE framework as focal onset motor seizures with retained awareness. Differential diagnoses include transient ischemic attacks, cortical myoclonus, and hemimotor dystonia. Historically described by Kojewnikoff in 1895, EPC has since been recognized as a distinct entity with its own nosological placement under focal status epilepticus. Etiologies range from Rasmussen encephalitis to focal cortical dysplasias and metabolic disturbances. Embryologically, focal cortical malformations underlying EPC arise from abnormal neuronal migration in the second trimester, affecting the dorsolateral neocortex. Neuroanatomically, the seizure focus resides in the primary motor cortex, typically within the hand\u2013arm area on the contralateral precentral gyrus, supplied by the superior division of the middle cerebral artery. Pathogenic excitatory circuits involve glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, while impaired GABAergic interneuron function exacerbates seizure sustainability.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor cortex physiology relies on a balance between excitatory glutamate-mediated depolarization and inhibitory GABA-mediated hyperpolarization. In EPC, this balance is disrupted by a localized hyperexcitable focus\u2014often due to structural lesions\u2014that generates repetitive cortical discharges. Molecularly, upregulation of NMDA receptors and downregulation of GABA-A receptors at the epileptogenic zone sustain seizure propagation. Proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2) may exacerbate neuronal hyperexcitability, while failure of astrocytic glutamate clearance further perpetuates excitatory tone. Over time, chronic seizure activity induces neuronal loss and gliosis, creating a self-reinforcing epileptogenic scar.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with EPC present with rhythmic or arrhythmic jerking of a focal muscle group\u2014commonly the distal upper limb or facial muscles\u2014occurring continuously or in clusters over hours to days. Awareness remains intact, allowing patients to describe preserved cognition. Frequency of jerks can range from 1\u201310 Hz. Subtypes include motor cortex EPC and extra-motor EPC (e.g., sensory symptoms). In pediatric cases, Rasmussen encephalitis is a predominant cause; in adults, stroke and neoplasm are leading etiologies. Without intervention, EPC can evolve into generalized status epilepticus or cause functional impairment of the affected limb.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by EEG showing repetitive, focal spike-and-wave or polyspike discharges correlating with the muscle jerks. MRI brain with epilepsy protocol is essential to identify structural lesions; high-resolution imaging (3 T) improves lesion detection. Functional imaging (ictal SPECT or interictal PET) can localize the epileptogenic zone when MRI is inconclusive. Laboratory tests should include metabolic panels (glucose, electrolytes) and autoimmune and infectious workups if indicated. A detailed history and examination rule out mimics such as cortical myoclonus and tremor.","management_principles":"Immediate treatment aims to abort ongoing seizures. First-line agents include benzodiazepines (e.g., IV lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg) to enhance GABAergic inhibition. Adjunctive focal AEDs\u2014levetiracetam (20\u201360 mg/kg/day) or lacosamide (200\u2013400 mg/day)\u2014are added for maintenance. In refractory cases or autoimmune etiologies (e.g., Rasmussen encephalitis), immunotherapy with corticosteroids or IVIG is indicated. Surgical options (lesionectomy, corticectomy) are considered when a discrete lesion is identified and seizures remain drug-resistant.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require serial EEG monitoring to assess seizure control and AED levels to guide titration. MRI follow-up at 6\u201312 months evaluates lesion progression. Neurological assessments every 3 months monitor functional status and cognitive effects of AEDs. Rehabilitation services (physical and occupational therapy) address residual motor deficits. Long-term prognosis depends on etiology and seizure control, with poorer outcomes in progressive causes like Rasmussen encephalitis.","clinical_pearls":"1.   Epilepsia partialis continua is a simple focal status epilepticus with preserved awareness\u2014recognize focal motor jerks without altered consciousness. 2.   MRI epilepsy protocol is crucial\u2014up to 30% of lesions are MRI-occult on standard imaging. 3.   Early benzodiazepine administration prevents receptor internalization and treatment resistance. 4.   Levetiracetam\u2019s SV2A binding makes it effective and well-tolerated as an adjunct. 5.
