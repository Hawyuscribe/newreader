[{"question_number":"4","question":"Which imaging technique is used to assess watershed infarction?","options":["MRI","CTA","PET scan","X-ray"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"MRI","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. MRI, particularly diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is the gold standard for detecting acute watershed infarcts in the cortical and internal border zones. Option B (CTA) is used to evaluate vessel patency but does not directly visualize parenchymal ischemia with the sensitivity of DWI-MRI. Option C (PET scan) can assess cerebral blood flow but is not practical acutely. Option D (X-ray) has no role in visualizing infarction. Numerous studies (e.g., Chalela et al., 2007) demonstrate DWI sensitivity >95% for acute ischemia compared to CT.","conceptual_foundation":"Watershed infarctions occur in regions between major arterial territories\u2014most commonly between anterior and middle cerebral arteries or between superficial and deep MCA territories. They result from hypotension or proximal arterial stenosis. MRI sequences including DWI, FLAIR, and perfusion imaging (PWI) allow spatial localization and assessment of infarct age. DWI changes occur within minutes of ischemia, reflecting cytotoxic edema, while FLAIR changes develop over hours.","pathophysiology":"Watershed infarcts result from hemodynamic compromise leading to failure of autoregulation in distal perfusion fields. Cytotoxic edema arises from Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase pump failure, causing intracellular water shift detectable as diffusion restriction on DWI. Prolonged hypoperfusion leads to infarction in border zones, often exacerbated by carotid stenosis or systemic hypotension.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with 'man-in-a-barrel' syndrome (bilateral proximal upper limb weakness) for ACA-MCA watershed infarcts or more subtle cognitive and visual deficits in internal border-zone infarcts. Approximate incidence of watershed infarcts is 10% of ischemic strokes. Hypotensive episodes and carotid carotid occlusive disease are common precipitants.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier imaging for suspected stroke is noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage. However, CT has poor sensitivity for acute watershed infarcts. MRI with DWI/ADC is indicated within 24 hours. CTA or MRA is second-tier to assess large-vessel stenosis. Perfusion MRI or CT perfusion can quantify cerebral blood flow and identify penumbra. Sensitivity of DWI for acute infarct is 95% (Wu et al., 2010).","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA guidelines: IV tPA if within 4.5 hours (Class I, Level A). Hemodynamic support to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure is critical in watershed strokes. Carotid endarterectomy is indicated for symptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis (70\u201399%) within 2 weeks (Class I). Blood pressure targets are individualized to avoid further hypoperfusion.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up MRI at 3\u20137 days to assess infarct evolution. Carotid imaging at 4\u20136 weeks poststroke to evaluate for restenosis. Rehabilitation for limb weakness should begin within 48 hours. Long-term secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy and risk factor modification with lipid targets of LDL <70 mg/dL.","clinical_pearls":"1. DWI-MRI is the most sensitive early test for watershed infarcts. 2. 'Man-in-a-barrel' syndrome is pathognomonic for ACA-MCA watershed infarction. 3. Hypotension in carotid stenosis patients can precipitate border-zone strokes. 4. Perfusion imaging can distinguish true infarction from penumbra. 5. Maintenance of adequate blood pressure is key in acute management.","references":"1. Chalela JA et al. Stroke. 2007;38(2):346-351. doi:10.1161/01.STR.0000250733.99029.46\n2. Wu O et al.

Where is the likely localization of the lesion?","options":["Pons","Medulla","Base of midbrain"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Base of midbrain","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C. Base of midbrain. A third nerve palsy with contralateral hemiparesis constitutes Weber syndrome, a midbrain fascicular oculomotor lesion affecting the oculomotor nerve fascicles before exit, and the cerebral peduncle corticospinal fibers. Lesion in the pons (A) produces Millard-Gubler or Foville syndrome with facial paralysis, not isolated third nerve palsy. Medullary lesions (B) involve lower cranial nerves and long tracts (Wallenberg, Dejerine), not CN III. The base of midbrain lesion compresses exiting oculomotor nerve and adjacent descending corticospinal tracts.","conceptual_foundation":"Brainstem syndromes are classified by anatomical location: midbrain, pons, medulla. Weber syndrome falls under mesencephalic ventral column lesions. In ICD-11, focal midbrain ischemia is under 8B61. Differential diagnoses include Benedikt syndrome (tegmental), Claude syndrome (dorsal), and Parinaud syndrome (dorsal midbrain). Embryologically, the midbrain arises from the mesencephalon; oculomotor nerve nuclei develop ventrally, and corticospinal fibers descend through the basis pedunculi.","pathophysiology":"An infarct or compression at the ventral midbrain (paramedian branches of PCA) disrupts the oculomotor fascicles before they exit the interpeduncular fossa, causing ipsilateral ptosis, \u201cdown and out\u201d eye, and ipsilateral mydriasis due to parasympathetic fiber involvement. Simultaneous involvement of the crus cerebri\u2019s descending corticospinal fibers produces contralateral hemiparesis. Vascular occlusion of the paramedian branches of the posterior cerebral artery or top of basilar perforators is the usual mechanism.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with acute onset ipsilateral ptosis, ophthalmoplegia (inability to elevate, adduct, depress eye), pupil dilation, and contralateral spastic hemiplegia. Sensory modalities are preserved since lemniscal pathways are dorsal. Other features may include mild ataxia if cerebellothalamic fibers are partially involved.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI brain with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging localizes ventral midbrain lesions. MRA or CTA evaluates PCA and basilar arteries for occlusion. Neurological exam confirms fascicular ocular motor pattern. Pretest probability is guided by vascular risk factors. CT may be initially normal for small brainstem infarcts.","management_principles":"Acute management follows ischemic stroke protocols: IV thrombolysis within 4.5 hours, endovascular thrombectomy if large vessel involvement. Aspirin and secondary prevention per AHA/ASA guidelines. Control of vascular risk factors. Rehabilitation for hemiparesis and oculomotor dysfunction includes physical and occupational therapy, and prism or occlusion for diplopia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial neurological examinations to monitor recovery. Follow-up MRI at 3\u20136 months to document lesion resolution. Eye movement exercises with orthoptic consultation. Spasticity management with physiotherapy. Long-term antiplatelet therapy if small\u2010vessel stroke is etiologic.","clinical_pearls":"1. Weber syndrome: ipsilateral oculomotor palsy with contralateral hemiparesis localizes to ventral midbrain. 2. Pupillary involvement indicates fascicular lesion before peripheral split. 3. PCA paramedian perforators supply the ventral midbrain tegmentum. 4. Oculomotor palsy plus facial weakness suggests pons, not midbrain. 5. Early MRI DWI is essential to detect small brainstem strokes.","references":"1. Lipton P. Cerebral ischemia. Physiol Rev. 1999;79(4): 1743\u20131801. doi:10.1152/physrev.1999.79.4.1743 2. Caplan LR.

Broca\u2019s aphasia (Option A) is characterized by nonfluent, effortful speech with relatively preserved comprehension and is classically due to inferior frontal gyrus lesions, not angular gyrus involvement. Transcortical motor aphasia (Option C) involves sparing of repetition in the context of nonfluent speech due to lesions anterior or superior to Broca\u2019s area, rather than parietal lobe lesions. Functional imaging and lesion studies have demonstrated that naming deficits in Gerstmann syndrome correlate with angular gyrus hypometabolism.","conceptual_foundation":"Anomia, defined as difficulty in word finding despite intact comprehension and repetition, is classified under ICD-11 code F80.1 (Expressive language disorder). It arises from disruption of the language network connecting Wernicke\u2019s area, Broca\u2019s area, and the angular gyrus via the arcuate fasciculus. The angular gyrus contributes to semantic integration necessary for lexical access. Embryologically, language-dominant cortical areas develop from perisylvian zones in the lateral telencephalic wall. Differential diagnosis includes conduction aphasia, transcortical sensory aphasia, and semantic dementia.","pathophysiology":"Word retrieval involves coordinated activity across temporal lexical stores and frontal executive processes. Lesions in the angular gyrus impair semantic processing and retrieval of lexical items by disrupting cortico\u2010cortical projections. At the cellular level, ischemic or compressive damage causes loss of pyramidal neurons and disconnection of glutamatergic pathways in the inferior parietal lobule, leading to anomic errors. Surrounding perilesional cortex may compensate, but often incompletely, resulting in persistent naming deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with anomia exhibit pauses, circumlocutions, and paraphasic errors when attempting to name objects, despite preserved fluency and comprehension. Severity ranges from tip\u2010of\u2010the\u2010tongue phenomena to global word retrieval failure. On examination, confrontation naming and responsive naming tasks reveal deficits, while repetition and auditory comprehension remain intact.","diagnostic_approach":"Neuropsychological testing includes the Boston Naming Test and PALPA naming subtests, which demonstrate impaired naming with preserved other language modalities. MRI with DWI or FLAIR identifies parietal lesions. Functional imaging (fMRI/PET) shows hypometabolism in the angular gyrus during naming tasks.","management_principles":"Treatment involves intensive speech-language therapy using cueing hierarchies, semantic feature analysis, and phonological component analysis. Pharmacologic adjuncts such as donepezil have been studied with mixed results. Noninvasive brain stimulation (rTMS, tDCS) targeting the perilesional cortex has shown promise in small trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial assessment of naming through standardized tests every 4\u20138 weeks to gauge therapy response. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up depends on lesion etiology\u2014vascular or neoplastic\u2014with imaging as appropriate.","clinical_pearls":"1. Anomia in Gerstmann syndrome reflects angular gyrus involvement. 2. It is dissociated from repetition and comprehension deficits. 3. Naming therapy should focus on semantic networks. 4.

Global aphasia involves impairment of all language modalities (production, comprehension, reading, writing). Recovery patterns are influenced by lesion size, site (perisylvian cortex), collateral circulation, and patient age.

Penumbral regions may recover over days to weeks, restoring some perisylvian function. Restoration of perilesional blood flow and cortical reorganization via ipsilesional and contralesional networks underlie the transition to a nonfluent aphasic profile. Plasticity processes involve upregulation of growth factors and synaptic remodeling.","clinical_manifestation":"Global aphasia presents with severe nonfluent speech, impaired comprehension, poor repetition, and reading/writing deficits.
