Young-onset orolingual dystonia accompanied by cognitive impairment with no family history suggests neuroacanthocytosis syndromes (e.g., Chorea\u2013acanthocytosis, McLeod syndrome). These disorders are characterized by spuriously shaped erythrocytes (acanthocytes) on peripheral smear. Option B (Htt gene) is incorrect because Huntington disease is autosomal dominant with positive family history and typically chorea rather than primarily orolingual dystonia. Option C (slit lamp examination) is used to detect Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings in Wilson disease, which presents with parkinsonism, dystonia, and hepatic involvement, but cognitive deficits and orolingual dystonia without liver or psychiatric signs are less typical. Thus, a peripheral smear to detect acanthocytes is the most appropriate initial investigation.","conceptual_foundation":"Neuroacanthocytosis syndromes are rare autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders characterized by red cell membrane protein defects leading to spiculated erythrocytes. Chorea\u2013acanthocytosis is due to VPS13A gene mutations (Chorein deficiency), and McLeod syndrome arises from XK gene mutations. Clinically, neuroacanthocytosis presents in young adults with orofacial dyskinesias (lip and tongue biting), generalized chorea, dystonia, seizures, and neuropsychiatric features. These conditions are classified under ICD-11 code 8A80. Differential diagnoses include Wilson disease (ICD-11 8C84), Huntington disease (ICD-11 6A02.0), and early-onset dystonia syndromes. Historically, the term neuroacanthocytosis encompassed multiple phenotypes until molecular delineation separated Chorea\u2013acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome in the 1990s.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, erythrocyte membrane proteins (band 3, spectrin) maintain a discocyte shape. In neuroacanthocytosis, mutations in VPS13A or XK disrupt membrane protein\u2013cytoskeletal interactions, causing altered lipid asymmetry and spur-like projections (acanthocytes). Neuronal loss in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus stems from accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and impaired autophagy. Neurodegeneration leads to orolingual dystonia and cognitive decline. In contrast, Huntington disease involves CAG repeat expansion in HTT causing polyglutamine toxicity predominantly in striatal neurons. Wilson disease involves copper accumulation and free radical damage in basal ganglia and liver.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with neuroacanthocytosis typically present in the third decade with involuntary orofacial movements (tongue protrusion, lip biting), feeding dystonia, chorea, and progressive cognitive impairment including executive dysfunction and psychiatric symptoms. Seizures occur in ~40% of cases. Motor signs often begin as orolingual dystonia before generalized chorea. Unlike Wilson disease, hepatic dysfunction is absent. Natural history is progressive over 10\u201320 years with eventual severe dysphagia, weight loss, and dementia.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: peripheral blood film to detect acanthocytes (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%). Elevated creatine kinase and neuroimaging showing caudate atrophy support diagnosis. Second-tier: genetic testing for VPS13A and XK mutations (definitive). MRI demonstrates putamen and caudate volume loss. Exclude Wilson disease with ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper. EEG for seizure evaluation. The stepwise approach begins with the least invasive smear followed by targeted genetic testing.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapies exist. Symptomatic treatment includes anticholinergics (trihexyphenidyl) for dystonia, tetrabenazine for chorea, and antiepileptics for seizures. Deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus can reduce dystonia. Cognitive and psychiatric symptoms are managed with SSRIs or antipsychotics. Physical and speech therapy help maintain function. Regular monitoring for nutrition and swallowing safety is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3\u20136 months with multidisciplinary team: neurology, speech, and nutrition. Monitor motor severity using the Unified Huntington\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (adapted for acanthocytosis), cognitive function with MoCA, and psychiatric status. Annual MRI to track progression. Regular CK levels if on tetrabenazine. Assess for DBS candidacy in refractory dystonia.","clinical_pearls":"1. Orolingual chorea and feeding dystonia in a young adult with cognitive decline strongly suggest neuroacanthocytosis. 2. Acanthocytes on peripheral smear are a high-yield, inexpensive screening test. 3. Absence of liver disease and negative slit-lamp exam help distinguish from Wilson disease. 4. Genetic testing for VPS13A confirms chorea\u2013acanthocytosis; XK gene for McLeod syndrome. 5. Management is symptomatic; consider DBS for severe dystonia.","references":"1. Danek A, et al.

Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, now termed pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), is caused by mutations in the PANK2 gene encoding pantothenate kinase 2. PKAN-1 refers to the classic PANK2-associated NBIA phenotype (Hayflick et al. 2003). No other gene is implicated in classic Hallervorden-Spatz (PANK2) presentations.","conceptual_foundation":"NBIA encompasses genetic disorders with brain iron accumulation, classified in ICD-11 under 8A00.8. PKAN is the most common NBIA subtype. Differential includes PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN), FAHN (FA2H), and MPAN (C19orf12). Historical term Hallervorden-Spatz fell out of favor due to eponym\u2019s unethical legacy. The PANK2 gene sits on chromosome 20p13 and encodes a mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing phosphorylation of pantothenate (vitamin B5).","pathophysiology":"Pantothenate kinase 2 deficiency leads to impaired coenzyme A biosynthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and iron dysregulation. This results in neuronal loss, gliosis, and iron deposition in globus pallidus and substantia nigra (Drecourt et al. 2018). Iron accumulation promotes oxidative injury via Fenton chemistry. Neuronal death predominates in extrapyramidal motor circuits, causing dystonia and parkinsonism.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic PKAN presents in childhood with progressive dystonia, rigidity, and dysarthria. \u2018Eye-of-the-tiger\u2019 sign on T2 MRI (bilateral globus pallidus hyperintensity surrounded by hypointensity) is pathognomonic.

Genetic testing of PANK2 confirms diagnosis. Exclude other NBIA genes via panel testing. Pretest probability high with early-onset dystonia plus MRI findings.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists. Symptomatic treatment includes deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus for dystonia (Class II, Level C evidence) (Castelnau et al. 2005). Iron chelators like deferiprone under investigation. Supportive care with physiotherapy, speech therapy, and psychiatric management.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurological and MRI follow-up annually to monitor progression.

The combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, early autonomic failure manifesting as orthostatic hypotension, and the 'hot cross bun' sign on pontine T2-weighted MRI are pathognomonic for MSA-C subtype. Corticobasal degeneration (option B) presents with asymmetric rigidity, apraxia, and cortical sensory deficits, without a hot cross bun sign. Dementia with Lewy bodies (C) usually features visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, and parkinsonism responsive to levodopa without pontine hyperintensities. Idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (D) shows a better levodopa response, slow progression, and lacks the cerebellar signs and characteristic MRI findings. The hot cross bun sign (pontine cruciform hyperintensity) has reported sensitivity of 50\u201360% and specificity >95% for MSA (Nishie et al., 2004). Consensus diagnostic criteria for MSA (Gilman et al., 2008) list imaging features including hot cross bun sign as supportive evidence (Level C).","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic, adult-onset, progressive \u03b1-synucleinopathy (ICD-11: 8A29.0), encompassing parkinsonian (MSA-P) and cerebellar (MSA-C) variants. MSA is characterized by oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions of \u03b1-synuclein leading to neuronal degeneration in striatonigral, olivopontocerebellar, and autonomic pathways. First described by Graham and Oppenheimer in 1969, MSA unifies Shy-Drager syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and striatonigral degeneration. Differential diagnoses include PD, progressive supranuclear palsy, CBD, and cerebellar ataxias. Embryologically, vulnerable structures derive from both mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons and the metencephalic pontocerebellar region.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor control relies on dopaminergic signaling from substantia nigra to striatum and cerebellar circuits via pontine nuclei. In MSA, misfolded \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in oligodendrocytes compromise myelin integrity and trophic support, leading to transneuronal degeneration. Striatonigral degeneration causes parkinsonism; olivopontocerebellar degeneration causes ataxia. Autonomic failure arises from degeneration of intermediolateral columns in the spinal cord and medullary autonomic nuclei. The hot cross bun sign reflects gliosis and selective loss of pontine transverse fibers intersecting the median raphe, forming a cruciform hyperintensity on T2 imaging. Disease progression is rapid, with median survival ~6\u20139 years from onset. Oligodendroglial pathology distinguishes MSA from neuronal \u03b1-synucleinopathies such as PD.","clinical_manifestation":"MSA typically presents in the sixth decade. MSA-C shows gait ataxia, dysarthria, cerebellar signs in \u226575% of patients, MSA-P shows parkinsonism with poor levodopa response (<30% improvement on UPDRS) in 80%. Autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension in 50\u201375%, urinary incontinence) often occurs within 3 years of onset. Falls are early (<3 years) and frequent. REM sleep behavior disorder is seen in 60%. Diagnostic criteria (Gilman et al., 2008) require autonomic failure plus parkinsonism or cerebellar ataxia. Red flags include stridor and rapid progression. Median survival is 6\u201310 years. Conventional PD rarely has early orthostatic hypotension or cerebellar ataxia.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes autonomic testing (tilt-table: drop in systolic BP \u226520 mmHg or diastolic BP \u226510 mmHg within 3 min; sensitivity 80%, specificity 90%) and brain MRI. MRI hot cross bun sign (sensitivity 50\u201360%, specificity >95%) and putaminal hypointensity with rim sign (T2 hypointense lateral putaminal rim) support MSA. DAT-SPECT shows reduced striatal uptake in both PD and MSA (cannot distinguish). Second-tier tests include urodynamic studies demonstrating detrusor hyperreflexia plus sphincter denervation, and polysomnography for REM sleep behavior disorder. Olfactory testing shows relatively preserved smell in MSA vs loss in PD. Skin biopsy for \u03b1-synuclein in autonomic fibers is investigational.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists. Supportive treatment includes fludrocortisone (0.1\u20130.2 mg daily) and midodrine (2.5\u201310 mg TID) for orthostatic hypotension (Class III evidence), levodopa trial with slow up\u2010titration (poor response <30%), use of CPAP for stridor. Physical and occupational therapy address cerebellar and parkinsonian dysfunction. Experimental approaches include immunotherapy targeting \u03b1-synuclein. Palliative care for advanced autonomic and motor symptoms is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular multidisciplinary follow-up every 3\u20136 months to monitor motor progression with UPDRS, autonomic function, and swallowing. Repeat MRI only if clinical syndrome changes. Early involvement of speech therapy for dysphagia reduces aspiration risk. Advance care planning within 2 years of diagnosis is recommended.

In MSA, falls and autonomic failure (e.g., orthostatic hypotension) occur early (within 3\u20135 years), and levodopa response is minimal. In contrast, idiopathic PD patients often retain good levodopa responsiveness for many years, with autonomic dysfunction and postural instability emerging in advanced stages (>10 years).

PD\u2019s nosology has evolved since James Parkinson\u2019s 1817 description. Differential diagnoses include MSA, progressive supranuclear palsy, and CBD.","pathophysiology":"Normal nigrostriatal pathway facilitates voluntary movement via dopaminergic projections from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum, modulating basal ganglia circuitry. In PD, aggregated \u03b1-synuclein forms Lewy bodies in neurons, causing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal death. Dopamine depletion leads to overactivity of the indirect pathway and underactivity of the direct pathway, resulting in bradykinesia and rigidity. Late in the disease, degeneration spreads to autonomic nuclei (dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, intermediolateral cell column) causing orthostatic hypotension.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical PD presents at mean age 60 years with bradykinesia, resting tremor (4\u20136 Hz), rigidity, and postural instability developing later (>5 years).
