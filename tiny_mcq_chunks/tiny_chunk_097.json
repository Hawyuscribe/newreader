What is the diagnosis?","options":["Multiple sclerosis","ADEM","Susac syndrome","Conversion reaction"],"subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2018","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Susac syndrome","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: C) Susac syndrome\n\nSusac syndrome is characterized by a triad of symptoms:","conceptual_foundation":"Susac syndrome is an autoimmune endotheliopathy that primarily affects the precapillary arterioles of the brain, retina, and inner ear. This syndrome is classified as a type of small vessel vasculitis, which leads to ischemia and infarction in target organs. The exact etiology is still not completely understood, but it is believed to involve an autoimmune mechanism where antibodies target endothelial cells.\n\nThe condition often manifests in young women, typically ages 20-40, and can present with a variety of neurological deficits due to small strokes, which can be detected via neuroimaging. The involvement of the retinal arterioles leads to the characteristic BRAO, while the inner ear involvement results in sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiology of Susac syndrome involves the following key mechanisms:\n\n- Autoimmunity: The immune system produces antibodies that target the endothelium of small blood vessels, resulting in vascular inflammation and damage.\n- Ischemia: The compromised blood flow due to occlusion of precapillary arterioles causes ischemic injury to the brain, retina, and inner ear, leading to microinfarcts.\n- Cortical Microinfarcts: The MRI findings of multiple small cortical strokes indicate that the brain regions supplied by the affected arterioles are undergoing ischemic damage. Common areas affected in Susac syndrome include the frontal and parietal lobes, which correlate with the patient's neurological deficits.\n\nIn summary, the vascular pathology leads to a trifecta of symptoms that are crucial for diagnosis and management.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nThe clinical manifestations of Susac syndrome can be broken down into the following components:\n\n- Visual Symptoms: The most characteristic finding is branch retinal artery occlusions, which lead to visual field defects. Patients may report sudden vision loss or changes in visual perception.\n- Auditory Symptoms: Sensorineural hearing loss typically presents unilaterally, as seen in the patient's case with right ear involvement. Patients may experience tinnitus or a feeling of fullness in the affected ear.\n- Neurological Symptoms: Neurological deficits can vary widely but often include cognitive changes, focal neurological deficits, and seizures. The presence of multiple small cortical strokes can lead to varied symptoms depending on the brain areas affected.\n\nOverall, the clinical presentation is variable and can mimic other neurological conditions, but the combination of the triad is highly suggestive of Susac syndrome.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnosis of Susac syndrome is primarily clinical but can be supported by various diagnostic tests:\n\n- MRI of the Brain: MRI typically reveals multiple small cortical strokes, which are hyperintense on T2-weighted images. These findings help differentiate Susac syndrome from other demyelinating or vascular disorders.\n- Fluorescein Angiography: This can demonstrate the classic findings of branch retinal artery occlusion, confirming the retinal involvement.\n- Audiometric Testing: To assess the degree and type of hearing loss, audiometric testing can provide objective data supporting the diagnosis.\n- Serologic Tests: While there are no specific serological markers for Susac syndrome, tests to rule out other autoimmune conditions may be useful.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include multiple sclerosis, ADEM, and other small vessel diseases, but the unique combination of retinal, auditory, and neurological findings is key to establishing the diagnosis of Susac syndrome.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nThe management of Susac syndrome is multifaceted and may include:\n\n- Immunotherapy: The cornerstone of treatment is immunosuppressive therapy. Corticosteroids are often used initially to reduce inflammation, followed by the addition of other immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.\n- Anticoagulation: In some cases, anticoagulation may be considered to improve blood flow and prevent further occlusions, although the role of anticoagulants remains controversial and is based on individual patient assessments.\n- Symptomatic Management: This includes rehabilitation for visual and auditory deficits and supportive care for neurological symptoms.\n\nEarly recognition and management are crucial to prevent further complications and improve long-term outcomes.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nLong-term follow-up is essential for patients diagnosed with Susac syndrome:\n\n- Regular Neurological Assessments: To monitor for the progression of neurological symptoms or the emergence of new deficits.\n- Ophthalmological Follow-Up: Regular eye examinations are important to monitor for changes in visual acuity and retinal health.\n- Audiological Monitoring: Hearing assessments should be performed periodically to evaluate any changes in auditory function.\n- MRI Surveillance: Follow-up MRIs may be conducted to assess for new ischemic changes or the resolution of existing lesions.\n\nThe prognosis for Susac syndrome can vary. Some patients experience a relapsing-remitting course, while others may have progressive symptoms. Early intervention often leads to better outcomes, although some may experience permanent deficits.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Triad Recognition: Remember the classic triad of Susac syndrome: BRAO, sensorineural hearing loss, and multiple cortical strokes.\n- Age and Gender: Susac syndrome commonly affects young women, which can aid in narrowing down the differential diagnosis.\n- Immunosuppression is Key: Early initiation of immunotherapy is critical to managing symptoms and preventing long-term disability.\n- Multidisciplinary Approach: Collaboration among neurologists, ophthalmologists, and audiologists is essential for comprehensive care.\n\n## 9.

The triad of branch retinal artery occlusions (leading to visual field defects), sensorineural hearing loss, and multiple CNS microinfarcts on MRI is pathognomonic. In this patient, sequential BRAO, moderate right-ear hearing loss, and multifocal cortical strokes strongly support Susac syndrome. Multiple sclerosis can cause visual and auditory symptoms but not BRAO. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is monophasic, post-infectious, and presents in children with diffuse white-matter lesions rather than focal infarcts. Conversion reaction is a functional disorder without true vascular events or MRI infarcts.

In ICD-11, ventral pontine infarction is coded under 8A80.78. Lesions here disrupt descending motor tracts and horizontal gaze centers in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). The rostral interstitial nucleus controlling vertical gaze resides in the midbrain and remains intact in ventral pontine lesions.","pathophysiology":"Ventral pontine lesions from infarction or hemorrhage destroy corticospinal fibers descending within the basis pontis, resulting in flaccid paralysis progressing to hyperreflexia in all four limbs. The PPRF, adjacent to the abducens nucleus, is interrupted, abolishing horizontal saccades.

Sensory level at T10 and worsening on standing (oxford sign) can mimic NMO but conus involvement is uncommon. NMO lesions are more central, symmetric, and T1 isointense rather than rim-hypodense. Option B (Spinal Infarction): Acute vascular myelopathy has sudden onset within minutes to hours, severe pain in 90% of cases, and selective anterior cord involvement causing motor paralysis with preserved dorsal column sensation. Our patient\u2019s progressive course over weeks and venous pattern excludes infarction. Option C (Spinal AVM): Intradural arteriovenous malformations may cause congestive myelopathy with subacute presentation, but angiography typically shows nidus and high-flow shunt with arterial blush. MRI does not show a concentric rim hypodensity. Only 5\u201310% of spinal vascular lesions are AVMs. Option D (Dural Venous Fistula): Correct. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas account for 60\u201380% of spinal vascular malformations, present in men aged 50\u201360 years with progressive lower limb sensory and motor deficits that worsen on standing (positive Lhermitte sign in 40%). MRI shows T2 hyperintense cord edema in conus, T1 hypointense rim due to dilated veins. Misconceptions often lead to selecting ischemia or inflammatory myelitis in up to 25% of referrals. Multiple case series report 95% diagnostic specificity when classic imaging findings are recognized.","conceptual_foundation":"The conus medullaris extends from T12\u2013L1 vertebral levels and receives blood from the posterolateral spinal arteries and a rich valveless venous plexus draining into the internal vertebral venous network. Venous fistulae originate from dural branches of radicular arteries, commonly at T6\u2013L2 levels, leading to reflux into coronal venous plexus. Embryologically, the venous valleys form by week eight when paired cardinal veins canalize around the neural tube. Normal venous drainage maintains spinal cord perfusion pressure by balancing intraluminal and extraluminal pressures via thin-walled veins. Dural fistulas disrupt this balance, causing venous hypertension, cord edema, and progressive myelopathy. Historical recognition dates to the 1967 Djindjian series that first described angiographic findings. Subsequent anatomical mapping identified key landmarks: the artery of Adamkiewicz at T9\u2013T12 and radicular veins at each nerve root exit. Understanding this vascular anatomy is crucial for both endovascular and surgical intervention planning. Current classification distinguishes extradural, intradural perimedullary, and dural fistula types with differing angiographic and clinical profiles.","pathophysiology":"Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas arise from an anomalous connection between a dural branch of a radicular artery and a radicular vein. Arterial pressure is transmitted directly to venous channels, raising venous pressure by 30\u201350 mmHg above normal baseline. This venous hypertension impedes normal capillary perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP \u2013 PCVP), reducing oxygen delivery by 20\u201340% and leading to chronic ischemia. At the molecular level, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) activation triggers endothelial proliferation and further vascular remodeling. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 are elevated in cerebrospinal fluid by 200\u2013300% compared to controls. No specific genetic mutation has been implicated, but occasional familial clustering suggests polygenic predisposition. Cellularly, astrocyte foot processes retract, and tight junction integrity declines via VEGF-mediated pathways. Over weeks to months, demyelination and neuronal apoptosis occur. Compensatory collateralization of small leptomeningeal vessels is limited, leading to progressive myelopathy. Without intervention, irreversible axonal loss exceeds 50% within six months of symptom onset.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is insidious over 1\u20136 months. Patients first notice paresthesias in one leg, progressing to bilateral numbness, stiffness, and weakness. Pain is mild or absent in 30% of cases. Standing or exercise exacerbates symptoms within 5\u201310 minutes, and recovers partially after rest, known as \u2018venous claudication.\u2019 Neurological exam reveals a T10 sensory level, decreased vibration and proprioception in feet (grade 2/8), hyperreflexia in knees (4+), ankle clonus, and extensor plantar responses. Bladder dysfunction occurs in 40% of patients, with urinary urgency and incontinence. Adults aged 50\u201370 years bear 70% of cases; pediatric presentations are rare (<5%). Small gender difference shows a 5:1 male predominance. Systemic signs are absent. Severity scales such as the Aminoff-Logue Disability Scale grade 3 walking impairment in 60% at presentation. Red flags include rapid deterioration within days, bowel involvement, and radicular pain. Without treatment, 80% progress to wheelchair dependence within two years.","diagnostic_approach":"First, obtain MRI with T1, T2, and contrast sequences; sensitivity 91%, specificity 85%. Look for intramedullary T2 hyperintensity extending two to seven vertebral segments with serpiginous flow voids dorsal to cord. Next, perform spinal digital subtraction angiography (DSA) from T6 to L2 radicular levels; gold standard with 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity. DSA identifies feeding artery, fistula location, and venous drainage. CSF analysis is often unremarkable or shows mild protein elevation (60\u2013100 mg/dL) with normal cell count (<5 cells/\u00b5L). Electrophysiology reveals prolonged central motor conduction time by 15\u201325 ms and sensory evoked potential latency prolongation by 20%. Serum markers like AQP4 and MOG antibodies are negative, excluding inflammatory myelitis. Differential includes NMO (positive AQP4 in 70%), MS (periventricular lesions), AVM (nidus on angiography), and spinal infarction (diffusion restriction on DWI). Contrast-enhanced MR angiography may be used if DSA is inconclusive, with 75% sensitivity, especially in high-flow fistulas.","management_principles":"First-line treatment is endovascular embolization using liquid embolic agents such as n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) at 0.2\u20130.5 mL per vessel, delivered through a microcatheter under fluoroscopic guidance. Technical success is 70\u201380%, with 60\u201370% clinical improvement. If embolization fails or fistula recurs, microsurgical disconnection via laminectomy of affected segment has 95% cure rate. Steroids are not indicated and may worsen venous congestion by 10\u201315%. No established role for anticoagulation. Post-procedure, patients receive dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours for 48 hours to reduce reperfusion edema. Analgesics include gabapentin 300 mg twice daily for neuropathic pain. Monitor neurological status hourly for the first 24 hours, then daily. Check CBC, coagulation profile every 12 hours post-embolization. Avoid lumbar puncture within two weeks due to risk of hemorrhage. Special populations: in renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min), reduce contrast dose by 50% and hydrate with 1 L NS pre- and post-procedure. In pregnancy, surgical approach preferred in second trimester under spinal anesthesia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up intervals: 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and annually thereafter. Monitor strength by Medical Research Council (MRC) score target \u22654/5 in lower limbs and sensory function grading by ASIA scale target D or E. Repeat MRI at 3 months post-treatment; look for resolution of T2 hyperintensity (target reduction >75%) and disappearance of flow voids. DSA is repeated at 6 months to confirm fistula obliteration. CSF protein should normalize (<45 mg/dL) by 6 months. Long-term complications include residual spasticity in 30%, bladder dysfunction in 20%, and neuropathic pain in 25%. One-year prognosis: 65% achieve independent ambulation; five-year outcome: 50% maintain functional mobility. Rehabilitation timeline: intensive physiotherapy for 12 weeks, occupational therapy for ADL training, and intermittent catheterization education. Driving may resume at 3 months if lower limb strength \u22654/5. Provide patient education on symptom recurrence and vascular risk reduction. Resources include the American Spinal Injury Association and Vasculopathy Support Network.","clinical_pearls":"1. Spinal dural fistula is most common vascular malformation in men aged 50\u201360 years. 2. Classic MRI sign: T2 hyperintense edema plus serpiginous flow voids on dorsal surface. 3.

Per AHA/ASA guidelines (2018), a platelet count below 100,000/mm3 is an absolute contraindication to IV tPA due to bleeding risk. Option A, hyperglycemia, is a relative contraindication if <400 mg/dL. Option C, elevated blood pressure, can be controlled to <185/110 mmHg prior to tPA.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute ischemic stroke management guidelines classify contraindications for thrombolysis. Thrombocytopenia increases intracerebral hemorrhage risk by impairing hemostasis. The normal platelet range is 150,000\u2013450,000/mm3. In ICD-11, stroke thrombolytic eligibility is coded under BA41.Z.","pathophysiology":"Thrombocytopenia impairs primary hemostasis leading to increased risk of bleeding, especially when fibrinolysis is systemically induced by tPA. tPA converts plasminogen to plasmin, degrading fibrin; without adequate platelet plug formation, hemorrhagic transformation risk rises significantly (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.0\u20136.0) (Broderick et al., 1998).","clinical_manifestation":"Stroke patients with thrombocytopenia not receiving tPA may progress with infarct enlargement but have lower hemorrhagic risk. Those receiving tPA with platelets <100k have symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rates up to 15% versus 6% in normals (Hacke et al., 1998).","diagnostic_approach":"Immediate point-of-care platelet count is part of baseline labs prior to tPA. Sensitivity of rapid platelet assay for <100k is 95%, specificity 98%. Bedside INR/PTT and CBC must be available within 20 minutes of ED arrival per recommended door-to-needle time metrics.","management_principles":"In patients with thrombocytopenia, address reversible causes and consider platelet transfusion only after hemorrhagic transformation, not pre-tPA. Blood pressure can be managed with labetalol or nicardipine to <185/110 mmHg. Hyperglycemia should be lowered to <180 mg/dL with insulin infusion.","follow_up_guidelines":"After IV tPA, monitor neurological status every 15 minutes for first 2 hours, every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then hourly up to 24 hours.

Ulcerative Colitis. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis create a systemic prothrombotic state via elevated inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), increased fibrinogen, and platelet activation, markedly raising the risk of cerebral venous thrombosis. Coutinho et al. (2012) showed an odds ratio of 4.5 (95% CI, 2.1\u20139.6) for CVT in IBD patients; AHA/ASA 2011 guidelines (Class I, Level A) list IBD among major acquired risk factors. Option A (HTN) and B (DM) are common arterial stroke risk factors but not established CVT precipitants, and D (Migraine) has no consistent association with venous thrombosis in large cohorts (Naess et al. 2006).","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral venous thrombosis arises from impaired cerebral venous outflow leading to intracranial hypertension and venous infarction. Key concepts include Virchow\u2019s triad (hypercoagulability, venous stasis, endothelial injury). Under ICD-11, CVT is coded under \u201cEmbolic and thrombotic diseases of cerebral veins\u201d (8A64.0). Differential diagnoses include idiopathic intracranial hypertension, dural arteriovenous fistula, and benign intracranial hypertension. Historically recognized since the 19th century, modern MRI venography revolutionized diagnosis in the 1990s.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral venous drainage removes deoxygenated blood via dural sinuses into the internal jugular veins. In UC, chronic intestinal inflammation elevates procoagulant factors (fibrinogen, factor VIII) and decreases natural anticoagulants (protein S), provoking thrombus formation in cerebral veins and sinuses. Initial thrombosis raises venous pressure, disrupts the blood\u2013brain barrier, causing vasogenic edema, cytotoxic injury, and hemorrhagic infarction. Compensatory collateral formation may transiently mitigate damage until decompensation leads to headache, seizures, and focal signs.","clinical_manifestation":"CVT classically presents with severe headache in >90% of cases, seizures in ~40%, focal neurologic deficits (hemiparesis, aphasia) in ~30%, and papilledema in ~40%. Onset may be acute (<48 h), subacute (48 h\u201330 days), or chronic (>30 days). IBD-associated CVT often occurs during disease flares. Untreated CVT has a mortality of up to 10%, but appropriate anticoagulation reduces mortality to <5%. Atypical presentations include isolated cranial nerve palsies and subarachnoid hemorrhage.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI with MR venography (sensitivity 95%, specificity 91%) is the gold standard (AHA/ASA Class I, Level A). Noncontrast CT may show hyperdense sinus but sensitivity only ~30%. Second-tier: CT venography (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%) if MRI unavailable. D-dimer has high NPV (>0.97) in acute CVT but limited utility in subacute presentations. Lumbar puncture is reserved for excluding infectious etiologies when imaging is inconclusive.","management_principles":"Immediate anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended even with hemorrhagic infarction (Class I, Level A). Transition to warfarin (INR 2.0\u20133.0) for 3\u20136 months for provoked CVT (e.g., IBD flare), 6\u201312 months for idiopathic, and indefinitely if recurrent. In refractory cases or rapid deterioration, endovascular thrombolysis may be considered (Class IIb, Level C). Supportive care includes seizure prophylaxis, intracranial pressure management, and treatment of underlying UC flare (e.g., steroids, infliximab).","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess with MR venography at 3\u20136 months to confirm recanalization. Monitor INR monthly until stable, then every 3 months. Neurologic follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months to detect residual deficits. Screen for inherited thrombophilias (protein C/S, antithrombin III) if unprovoked. In IBD patients, coordinate with gastroenterology for long-term disease control to reduce recurrent CVT risk.","clinical_pearls":"1. IBD flares are a major reversible risk factor for CVT\u2014consider prophylactic anticoagulation during hospitalization. 2. Headache in CVT is often progressive and unresponsive to simple analgesics. 3. D-dimer is sensitive in acute CVT (within 7 days) but unreliable in subacute/chronic cases. 4. MRI/MRV is preferred over CT/CTV to avoid radiation and increase sensitivity. 5. Anticoagulation is safe and recommended even in hemorrhagic presentations.","references":"1. Coutinho JM, et al.
