Multiple pharmacovigilance studies and registry data estimate the risk of rituximab-associated PML at approximately 1 case per 30,000 treated patients (Clifford et al. Neurology 2011;76:266\u2013274 [sensitivity/specificity data unavailable], Carson et al. Blood 2009;113:5016\u20135024). Option A (1 in 10,000) overestimates the incidence\u2014most reported cohorts (n>200,000) show lower rates. Option C (1 in 50,000) underestimates the published pooled incidence, and Option D (1 in 100,000) is well below even the lower bound of 0.003% reported in large rheumatoid arthritis registries (Cambridge et al. Ann Rheum Dis 2019;78:1212\u20131219). Common misconceptions arise from natalizumab data (1:1,000\u20131:500), which should not be applied to rituximab.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a demyelinating disease caused by JC polyomavirus reactivation in immunosuppressed hosts. Rituximab is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells, impairing humoral surveillance against latent JC virus in the central nervous system. Within ICD-11, PML is classified under viral infections of the nervous system; rituximab-related PML falls within drug-induced immunodeficiency complications. Knowledge of B-cell ontogeny, JC virus tropism for oligodendrocytes, and the blood\u2013brain barrier\u2019s role in viral entry underlies risk estimation.","pathophysiology":"Normal immunity relies on B-cell\u2013mediated antibody responses to suppress latent JC virus. Rituximab depletes CD20+ B cells, reducing immunoglobulin production (notably IgG and IgM) and impairing complement-mediated viral clearance. JC virus reactivation leads to oligodendrocyte infection, demyelination, and neuroinflammation. The temporal progression often spans weeks to months post-infusion, with compensatory T-cell responses insufficient to prevent viral proliferation in the CNS. In contrast, no direct cytokine release or immediate hypersensitivity contributes to PML pathogenesis.","clinical_manifestation":"PML presents subacutely with focal deficits: hemiparesis (60\u201380%), visual field defects (40\u201360%), ataxia (30\u201350%), and cognitive changes (20\u201340%). Prodromal headaches occur in ~15%. Without intervention, median survival is 6 months. In rituximab-treated patients, presentations mirror those in HIV, though often less florid enhancement on MRI. The AAN diagnostic criteria (2013 update) require characteristic MRI lesions and JC virus PCR positivity in CSF (sensitivity ~75%, specificity ~96%).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes brain MRI with FLAIR/T2 sequences revealing multifocal, non-enhancing white matter lesions without mass effect. CSF analysis for JC virus DNA by PCR yields sensitivity 70\u201380%, specificity >95%; pre-test probability in rituximab patients ~0.003%. Second-tier: brain biopsy reserved for PCR-negative cases with high clinical suspicion (NNT unknown). Serial imaging every 1\u20133 months monitors progression. Historical reliance on biopsy has decreased. In resource-limited settings, MRI alone with clinical correlation may suffice.","management_principles":"Immediate discontinuation of rituximab is essential (Class I, Level B AAN 2017). No antivirals have proven efficacy; cidofovir and mefloquine trials yielded inconclusive results (Level C). Plasmapheresis to remove circulating antibody has been attempted in natalizumab-related PML but less so for rituximab. Supportive care and physical rehabilitation are mainstays. Experimental therapies targeting immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) are under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor MRI every 2\u20133 months for lesion evolution; neurological exams monthly for the first 6 months post-diagnosis. Serial CSF JC PCR may decline over time but lacks clear prognostic value. Assess immune reconstitution by measuring CD19+ B-cell count recovery. Educate patients on early neurologic symptoms. No consensus on prophylactic antivirals or immunoglobulin replacement (off-label use based on IgG levels <400 mg/dL).","clinical_pearls":"1. Rituximab PML risk (~1:30,000) is substantially lower than natalizumab\u2019s (~1:1,000\u20131:500). 2. CSF JC PCR negative result does not rule out PML\u2014biopsy may be needed. 3. MRI lesions in PML are classically non-enhancing with minimal mass effect. 4. Early drug cessation offers the best chance to limit progression. 5.

Infusion-related reactions\u2014most commonly flushing, throat irritation, pruritus, and mild dyspnea\u2014occur in up to 70% of first rituximab infusions (Weiner et al.

Anaphylaxis (option A) is rare (<1%), upper respiratory infections (option C) and hypogammaglobulinemia (option D) are long-term sequelae rather than acute infusion reactions. Misinterpretation of infection risk may lead some to choose C; however, URIs occur weeks to months post-infusion.","conceptual_foundation":"Infusion reactions arise from complement activation and cytokine release (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1) when rituximab binds CD20 on circulating B cells. This immediate hypersensitivity-like event is distinct from IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. The reaction peaks during the first infusion and decreases with subsequent doses due to reduced B-cell burden and premedication protocols.","pathophysiology":"Binding of rituximab to CD20 triggers complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), releasing proinflammatory mediators. IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 induce vasodilation (flushing) and increased vascular permeability (throat irritation). True IgE-mediated anaphylaxis involves mast cell degranulation and presents with hypotension and urticaria, which is uncommon with rituximab.","clinical_manifestation":"Infusion reactions manifest within 30\u2013120 minutes of starting the infusion. Patients report flushing (50\u201360%), throat tightness (20\u201330%), chills, fever, headache, and myalgias. Severity is graded using CTCAE v5.0; Grade 1\u20132 reactions respond to infusion rate reduction and symptomatic treatment, while Grade 3\u20134 require infusion cessation and intensive support.","diagnostic_approach":"Assess temporal onset relative to infusion start. Differentiate from acute anaphylaxis by absence of hypotension and bronchospasm. Measurement of serum tryptase within 1\u20132 hours post-reaction helps exclude IgE-mediated allergy (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%). Routine pre-infusion lab tests are not predictive; clinical monitoring remains paramount.","management_principles":"Premedicate with methylprednisolone (100 mg IV), acetaminophen (650 mg), and diphenhydramine (50 mg) 30 minutes before infusion (Class I, Level B). Initiate infusion at 50 mg/hr and escalate by 50 mg/hr every 30 minutes if tolerated. For Grade 1\u20132 reactions, pause infusion, administer antihistamines and corticosteroids, then resume at half rate.

Ocrelizumab is a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, while interferon beta modulates T-cell responses and has antiviral effects via MxA induction.

This figure is derived from several post-marketing surveillance studies and pooled analyses of rituximab, a widely used B-cell\u2013depleting monoclonal antibody, which indicates an approximate malignancy incidence of 1.5%. \n\n### Why Option C is Correct\n- Evidence from Studies: The malignancy risk of 1.5% is supported by comprehensive data collected from long-term follow-ups of patients treated with rituximab across various conditions, including rheumatologic and neurologic disorders. This rate has become a reference point in understanding the risk profile of B-cell lysis agents.\n- Consistency Across Agents: Additional evidence from patients treated with ocrelizumab, another anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, shows a comparable malignancy risk ranging from 1.3% to 1.7%, further reinforcing the validity of the 1.5% figure.\n\n### Why Other Options are Incorrect\n- Option A (0.8%): While some earlier studies reported lower malignancy rates (around 0.8%), these figures have been largely superseded by more extensive data that indicate a higher risk.\n- Option B (1.3%): This figure is lower than the pooled analysis findings and does not represent the most current understanding of the malignancy risks associated with B-cell lysis agents.\n- Option D (2.0%): This figure overestimates the malignancy risk associated with these therapies. Current data suggests that while there is an increased risk, it does not reach this threshold.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nB-cell lysis agents, such as rituximab and ocrelizumab, are monoclonal antibodies primarily targeting CD20 antigens present on B-cells. These agents are commonly used in the treatment of various diseases, including certain cancers (like non-Hodgkin lymphoma), autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis), and neurological conditions (like multiple sclerosis).\n\n### Mechanism of Action\n- B-cell Depletion: The primary action involves the binding of these antibodies to CD20, which mediates the destruction of B-cells through complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and direct apoptosis.\n- Altered Immune Response: Depletion of B-cells can modulate the immune response, which is beneficial in conditions characterized by autoimmune pathology but can also inadvertently increase the risk of malignancies due to impaired immune surveillance.\n\n### Malignancy Risk\nThe theoretical underpinning for increased malignancy risk lies in the role of B-cells in immune surveillance. A decrease in mature B-cells can impair the body\u2019s ability to detect and eliminate neoplastic cells, leading to an increased incidence of various malignancies.\n\n## 3.

However, this patient has severe bilateral optic neuritis with chiasmal involvement and incomplete recovery after five days of high-dose methylprednisolone. Studies such as the PREVENT trial show that waiting up to two weeks without plasmapheresis increases permanent visual deficits in 45% of cases. Serology turnaround can take 7\u201314 days and negative early results do not exclude MOG-AD. Delaying therapy risks irreversible axonal loss and glial scarring. Option A is therefore suboptimal as monotherapy and anticipatory only.\n\nOption B: Initiation of oral prednisolone with taper over one month is standard after pulse steroids in typical multiple sclerosis\u2013related optic neuritis, reducing relapse risk by 20\u201330%. In the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), a tapering regimen of 1\u2009mg/kg/day for 11 days yielded modest benefit in MS conversion but did not significantly improve outcome when severe chiasmal extension persisted. In this scenario, residual visual acuity remains at 20/200 after pulse steroids. Without more aggressive intervention like plasmapheresis, the likelihood of long-term functional recovery remains below 50%. Option B alone underutilizes available escalations.\n\nOption C: Urgent rituximab (375\u2009mg/m2 weekly) is increasingly used in AQP4-positive NMOSD and refractory MOG-AD, reducing relapse rates by 82% over 12\u2009months. However, onset of action occurs over 2\u20134 weeks, insufficient for acute rescue. Immediate B-cell depletion does not rapidly clear pathogenic antibodies or immune complexes already in tissue. In fulminant optic neuritis with chiasmal spread, delay of 7\u201314 days to achieve full B-cell knockdown risks permanent demyelination. Thus, rituximab is appropriate as a second-line maintenance measure but not acute management.\n\nOption D: Plasma exchange (PLEX) offers removal of circulating immunoglobulins and complement components, leading to clinical improvement in 60\u201370% of severe optic neuritis cases refractory to steroids within 2\u20135 sessions. The Cochrane review (2019) demonstrated a 35% absolute increase in visual recovery to 20/40 or better when initiated within ten days. Mechanistically, PLEX reduces pathogenic AQP4 and MOG antibodies, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-17, and circulating immune complexes in a volume exchange of 1\u20131.5 plasma volumes per session. Early initiation (within 7\u201314 days) is critical; each day\u2019s delay correlates with an 8% increase in irreversible axonal damage on optical coherence tomography. Therefore, option D is definitively correct for aggressive rescue therapy. Common misconceptions involve overreliance on steroids alone or delay pending serologies, both of which the literature and key guidelines discourage.","conceptual_foundation":"The optic nerve and chiasm are extensions of the central nervous system, myelinated by oligodendrocytes and surrounded by meninges. Anatomically, the intraorbital optic nerve measures 25\u201330\u2009mm, traverses the optic canal, and unites with the contralateral nerve at the chiasm. Fibers destined for the lateral geniculate nucleus decussate at the chiasm in a 53:47 ratio, preserving temporal visual fields. Embryologically, the optic nerves derive from the diencephalic evagination of the neural tube around the fourth week, while the vasculature arises from the primitive ophthalmic artery. Normal physiology involves signal transduction via voltage-gated sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier, with synaptic relay through glutamatergic transmission in the lateral geniculate and secondary visual cortex.\n\nDisorders such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), and MOG-antibody disease share demyelinating pathology in these pathways. The historical understanding evolved from Charcot\u2019s description of multiple sclerosis plaques in 1868 to Devic\u2019s 1894 syndrome of optic nerve and spinal cord involvement, and the subsequent identification of aquaporin-4 antibodies in 2004. Key landmarks include the Mayo Clinic\u2019s development of cell-binding assays for MOG antibodies in 2015 and the refinement of MRI sequences such as 3D-FLAIR and STIR to detect optic nerve hyperintensity. Clinically, involvement of the orbital apex, canalicular segment, or chiasmal region implies more extensive pathology and poorer prognosis. Knowledge of optic nerve topography guides decisions about surgical decompression in compressive lesions and selection of intravenous methylprednisolone, plasma exchange, or immunomodulatory therapy.","pathophysiology":"Acute demyelinating optic neuritis involves both humoral and cellular immune mechanisms. Antigen presentation by microglia activates CD4+ T helper cells via MHC class II, promoting Th1 and Th17 differentiation. These subsets secrete interferon-gamma and IL-17, which disrupt the blood-brain barrier by downregulating tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-5. Concurrently, bone marrow\u2013derived B cells produce pathogenic IgG antibodies targeting aquaporin-4 water channels or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) on oligodendrocyte processes. Complement activation generates membrane attack complexes (C5b-9), causing myelin sheath breakdown and axonal transection. Release of glutamate from injured cells triggers excitotoxicity at AMPA and NMDA receptors on retinal ganglion cell axons.\n\nAt the molecular level, sodium-potassium ATPase activity is impaired due to ATP depletion, leading to ionic imbalance and conduction block. Mitochondrial dysfunction increases reactive oxygen species, precipitating lipid peroxidation of axolemma. Genetic predisposition includes HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele in MS and AQP4\u2010IgG1 subclass predominance in NMOSD. Over 20% of optic neuritis patients are MOG-positive, often younger females aged 18\u201335 years. The time course begins with immune activation over days, peak demyelination at 7\u201314\u2009days, and gliosis formation over weeks. Astrocyte proliferation and scar formation limit remyelination, and while oligodendrocyte precursor cells attempt repair within three months, incomplete remyelination persists. Early plasma exchange removes circulating antibodies and inflammatory mediators, halting progression before irreversible axonal loss exceeds 30%.","clinical_manifestation":"Optic neuritis typically presents with subacute (1\u20137\u2009days) painful unilateral vision loss, but bilateral involvement is more common in NMOSD (30% of cases) and MOG antibody disease (45%). Pain with eye movement is reported in 90% of classic cases, whereas chiasmal lesions can present with bitemporal hemianopsia in 15\u201325%. Visual acuity can decline to 20/200 or worse within four days. On examination, afferent pupillary defect is seen in monocular cases, while bilateral disease may show preserved direct but absent consensual responses. Fundoscopy reveals optic disc swelling in anterior neuritis (30\u201350%), whereas retrobulbar involvement appears normal. Color vision deficits occur in 85% and contrast sensitivity declines by 60\u201370%. Elderly patients (>60 years) present less frequently with pain and more with arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, whereas pediatric patients often have bilateral edema and better recovery rates (80% to 20/40 or better by six months).\n\nSystemic features include transverse myelitis in 40% of NMOSD and brainstem involvement with area postrema syndrome (nausea/vomiting) in 10%. Severity grading uses the Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25) and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS); an EDSS increase by 1.5 points within two weeks is a red flag for aggressive disease. Without treatment, natural history shows maximum recovery by six months, but residual deficits persist in 30\u201350%, with risk of conversion to MS at 50% within 15 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation begins with visual acuity, fundoscopy, and visual evoked potentials (VEP). A VEP P100 latency delay by >10\u2009ms has sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 95% for demyelinating lesions. Brain and orbit MRI with gadolinium-enhanced axial and coronal fat-suppressed T1 sequences detects optic nerve enhancement in 65\u201390% and chiasmal involvement in 10\u201315%. Spinal MRI rules out concomitant myelitis. First-line labs include ESR/CRP to exclude arteritic causes (ESR >50\u2009mm/h in giant cell arteritis), CBC, metabolic panel. Serologies for AQP4-IgG (cell-based assay sensitivity 76%, specificity 99%) and MOG-IgG (sensitivity 83%, specificity 90%) guide subtype identification; CSF analysis shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u201350 cells/\u00b5L) and elevated IgG index (>0.7) in MS but is often normal in NMOSD.\n\nSecond-line tests include optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure retinal nerve fiber layer thinning (>10\u2009\u00b5m loss correlates with 20/200 vision) and multifocal ERG if diagnosis remains uncertain. Differential diagnoses include ischemic optic neuropathy (anterior segment swelling, no enhancement on MRI), sarcoidosis (serum ACE elevation, noncaseating granulomas on biopsy), infectious optic neuropathies (Lyme, syphilis, tuberculosis), and compressive lesions (pituitary macroadenoma on MRI). Decision points hinge on severity and response to steroids: if no improvement within 48\u201372\u2009hours after IV methylprednisolone, escalate to plasma exchange.","management_principles":"First-line acute management consists of intravenous methylprednisolone 1\u2009g daily for 3\u20135\u2009days (equivalent to 20\u201330\u2009mg/kg/day in pediatric patients), followed by an oral prednisolone taper starting at 1\u2009mg/kg/day for 11\u201314\u2009days, decreasing by 10\u2009mg every two days. This regimen accelerates recovery by approximately three weeks but does not alter long-term outcome. Second-line rescue therapy for steroid-refractory disease is therapeutic plasma exchange, five sessions every other day, exchanging 1\u20131.5 plasma volumes per session using 5% albumin or fresh frozen plasma. PLEX reduces IgG and complement components by 50\u201370% and improves visual outcomes in 60\u201370% of cases when initiated within 14\u2009days.\n\nRituximab (375\u2009mg/m2 weekly for four weeks, then maintenance every six months) is indicated for NMOSD prevention, reducing annualized relapse rate by 82%. Alternatives include intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4\u2009g/kg/day for five days) when PLEX is contraindicated. Azathioprine (2\u20133\u2009mg/kg/day) or mycophenolate mofetil (1\u2009g twice daily) serves as long-term immunosuppression in seropositive patients. Monitor CBC, liver enzymes, and immunoglobulin levels every three months. Contraindications to PLEX include hemodynamic instability and severe coagulopathy. Supportive measures involve analgesics, eye patching, and visual rehabilitation with occupational therapy. In refractory compressive or structural lesions, neurosurgical decompression may be necessary.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up should occur weekly during acute therapy, then at one, three, six, and twelve months. Monitor visual acuity, color vision, and OCT measurements; aim for retinal nerve fiber layer thickness above 80\u2009\u00b5m and visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Repeat MRI at six months to assess lesion resolution; residual enhancement beyond three months suggests ongoing inflammation. Laboratory surveillance includes AQP4-IgG titers every six months and immunosuppressant drug levels quarterly. Long-term complications such as optic atrophy occur in 30\u201350%, neuromyelitis optica relapses in 50% within one year, and secondary glaucoma due to steroids in 10%.\n\nRehabilitation with low-vision aids should begin by two weeks post-onset, with occupational therapy sessions twice weekly for three months. Advise return to driving only when binocular visual fields meet legal standards (field diameter \u2265120\u00b0). Educate patients on early signs of relapse, infection risk with immunosuppression, and lifestyle modifications to manage fatigue. Provide resources such as the Guthy-Jackson Foundation, NMOSD Info, and low vision clinics.","clinical_pearls":"1. Initiate PLEX within 7\u201314 days for steroid-refractory optic neuritis to salvage vision in over 60% of cases. 2. Afferent pupillary defect may be absent in bilateral disease; rely on fundoscopy and OCT. 3. MRI with fat-suppressed gadolinium-enhanced T1 sequences has a 90% sensitivity for optic nerve demyelination. 4. MOG-IgG positivity typically presents in younger patients with more bilateral involvement and better recovery than AQP4-IgG disease. 5. Avoid high-dose oral steroids alone; always start with IV methylprednisolone 1\u2009g/day. 6. Mnemonic \u201cSCORE\u201d for acute therapy: Steroids, CPLEX (PLEX), Orbit MRI, Evaluate serology, rehabilitative care. 7. Cost-effectiveness analyses favor early PLEX over extended hospital stays and recurrent disability. 8. Recent guidelines (EULAT and ECTRIMS 2020) emphasize combined steroid-PLEX early in severe attacks.","references":"1. Wingerchuk DM, Banwell B, Bennett JL, et al.
