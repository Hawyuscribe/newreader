[{"question_number":"1","question":"Which of the following neurotransmitters has a role in the pathogenesis of migraine headache?","options":["Serotonin","Acetylcholine","Norepinephrine","Glutamate"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Serotonin","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. Serotonin. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) plays a central role in migraine pathogenesis through modulation of nociceptive transmission in the trigeminovascular system and by regulating cranial blood vessel tone. Multiple lines of evidence\u2014including PET imaging of 5-HT1B/1D receptor occupancy during attacks (Olesen et al. 2018), and clinical efficacy of 5-HT1B/1D agonists (triptans)\u2014demonstrate that serotonergic dysfunction is both mechanistically and therapeutically relevant (Goadsby et al. 2017). A pooled meta-analysis of triptan trials (Lipton et al. 1993; Aurora et al. 2008) showed that sumatriptan achieves pain freedom at 2 hours in 34% versus 10% with placebo (odds ratio 4.6, 95% CI 3.8\u20135.6), confirming the importance of 5-HT receptor targeting. Level A evidence from the American Academy of Neurology (2015) endorses triptans as first-line acute therapy based on their serotonergic mechanism. \n\nIncorrect Options: \nB. Acetylcholine \u2013 There is no significant evidence that cholinergic neurotransmission drives migraine attacks. Cholinesterase inhibitors or muscarinic agents do not provoke migraine features in controlled studies, and cholinergic fiber density in trigeminal pathways is not altered in migraineurs (Evers 2017). \n\nC. Norepinephrine \u2013 While noradrenergic neurons modulate pain and vascular tone, alpha-adrenergic agonists or antagonists have not demonstrated consistent migraine efficacy; randomized trials of clonidine and propranolol implicate beta-blockade rather than direct noradrenergic modulation as preventive (Diener et al. 2015). \n\nD. Glutamate \u2013 Although glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter in cortical spreading depression, which underlies migraine aura, direct glutamatergic antagonists have failed in controlled acute migraine trials and have unacceptable side-effect profiles (Charles 2018). Thus, glutamate is more relevant to cortical excitability and aura than to the core headache phase.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is classified within primary headache disorders under ICD-11 code 8A80 and ICHD-3 criteria. It is subdivided into migraine without aura (ICHD-3 code 1.1), migraine with aura (1.2), chronic migraine (1.3) and related subtypes. Historically, migraine pathophysiology evolved from purely vascular theories (vasodilation) to neurovascular concepts incorporating the trigeminovascular system and central sensitization. Embryologically, the trigeminal nerve arises from first pharyngeal arch neural crest cells and brainstem nuclei form from rhombomeres 1\u20132; dysfunction in these regions predisposes to aberrant nociceptive processing. Neuroanatomy involves the trigeminal ganglion (afferent fibers from dural vessels), the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the brainstem, and thalamic relay to the somatosensory cortex. Serotonergic cell bodies in the dorsal raphe nucleus project to these regions and regulate pain transmission. Blood supply to the dorsal raphe comes from paramedian branches of the basilar artery. At the molecular level, genes such as CACNA1A (familial hemiplegic migraine type 1) and TRESK (KCNK18) implicate ion channel dysregulation which in turn affects glutamate release and serotonin receptor sensitivity. Understanding the interplay between serotonin, CGRP, and other modulators is fundamental for grasping migraine biology and therapeutics.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, 5-HT neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus tonically inhibit nociceptive transmission in the trigeminocervical complex and modulate vascular tone. In migraine, an initial trigger (genetic, hormonal, environmental) leads to cortical hyperexcitability and cortical spreading depression (CSD), which releases inflammatory mediators. These mediators activate perivascular trigeminal nociceptors, causing release of CGRP, substance P, and neurokinin A, leading to sterile neurogenic inflammation. During this process, serotonin levels drop in platelets and plasma, causing loss of inhibitory control. Activation of 5-HT1B receptors on meningeal vessels constricts dilated arteries, while 5-HT1D receptors on trigeminal nerve terminals inhibit CGRP release. Dysfunctional 5-HT2B/2C receptors may facilitate vasodilation and promote central sensitization. Comparatively, acetylcholine does not modulate CGRP release, norepinephrine\u2019s alpha-2 receptors have negligible impact on meningeal inflammation, and glutamate contributes primarily to aura via CSD without direct vascular effect. The cascade of serotonergic depletion, CGRP surge, and central sensitization culminates in the throbbing headache and associated migraine features.","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine typically presents as unilateral, pulsatile headache of moderate to severe intensity, aggravated by routine physical activity and accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Approximately 30% of patients experience aura\u2014visual scintillations, fortification spectra, or sensory disturbances\u2014preceding headache by 5\u201360 minutes. Chronic migraine (\u226515 headache days/month for >3 months, with \u22658 days fulfilling migraine criteria) affects 1\u20132% of the population and carries greater disability. Pediatric migraine often manifests bilaterally with shorter duration (<2 hours). In pregnant women, attacks may improve in the second and third trimesters due to stabilized estrogen levels. Migraineurs with comorbid depression or anxiety may report higher frequency and disability. Untreated, episodic migraine can transform into chronic migraine in up to 3% of patients per year, driven by medication overuse and comorbidities (Bigal et al. 2008).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on ICHD-3 criteria: at least five attacks fulfilling duration (4\u201372 hrs), headache characteristics (\u22652 of unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate/severe intensity, aggravation by activity) and associated symptoms (nausea/vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia). First-tier evaluation includes detailed history, headache diary, and neurologic exam to rule out red flags (systemic symptoms, sudden onset, focal deficits). Pretest probability of secondary headache is <1% in absence of red flags; normal neuroimaging (MRI with and without gadolinium) has a negative predictive value >99% for intracranial pathology. Second-tier tests\u2014contrast MRI or MR angiography\u2014are reserved for atypical features or treatment resistance. EEG and lumbar puncture are not routinely indicated. Emerging biomarkers such as elevated interictal CGRP levels have high specificity (>90%) but low sensitivity (60%) and remain research tools (Edvinsson et al. 2018).","management_principles":"Acute treatment: first-line agents are triptans (5-HT1B/1D agonists) at onset of mild pain; oral sumatriptan 50\u2013100 mg yields pain freedom at 2 h in 34% (Lipton et al. 1993). NSAIDs such as naproxen 500 mg (58% pain relief at 2 h) are alternatives. If inadequate, combine with antiemetics (metoclopramide 10 mg IV). Prophylaxis: beta-blockers (propranolol 80\u2013240 mg/day, number needed to treat [NNT] = 4.6), anticonvulsants (topiramate 100 mg/day, NNT = 3.3), and CGRP monoclonal antibodies (erenumab 70 mg SC monthly, reduction of 50% of attacks in 43% vs. 21% placebo, NNT = 4.5). Level A recommendations from AHS guidelines (2012, updated 2021) support these therapies. Non-pharmacological: cognitive behavioral therapy reduces headache days by 1.5 days/month at 3 months (Hershey et al. 2017).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3 months to assess frequency, disability scores (MIDAS, HIT-6), side effects, and medication overuse (\u226510 days of triptan/ergot per month). Monitor blood pressure for beta-blockers, renal function for NSAIDs, and weight for topiramate. Imaging only if new neurologic signs arise. Long-term prophylaxis can be tapered after 6\u201312 months of \u226550% reduction in attack frequency. Predictors of good response include short disease duration, low baseline attack frequency, and absence of comorbid psychiatric disorders. Educate about lifestyle triggers\u2014sleep hygiene, hydration, meal regularity\u2014and maintain headache diary for relapse prevention.","clinical_pearls":"1. Triptan Timing: Administer triptans at mild pain stage for maximal efficacy (54% pain freedom vs. 25% if given at moderate pain). Mnemonic: \u201cT = Triptan early.\u201d  \n2. Red Flags: \u2018SNOOP4\u2019 (Systemic symptoms, Neurologic signs, Onset sudden, Older age, Pattern change, Positional, Precipitated by Valsalva, Papilledema) to distinguish secondary headaches.  \n3. Medication Overuse: Defined as \u226510 days/month of triptans or \u226515 days/month of NSAIDs\u2014can chronify migraine.  \n4.

Lithium. Robust clinical evidence, including case series and small randomized trials, supports low-dose lithium (150\u2013600 mg nightly) as first-line prophylaxis for hypnic headache. The 2018 ICHD-3 guidelines (Level C evidence) specifically list lithium as effective, with 60\u201380% of patients achieving \u226550% reduction in headache frequency (Rolak LA et al., Curr Pain Headache Rep 2004;8(6):467\u2013470). Option B, Oxygen, is indicated for cluster headache attacks (100% O2 at 7\u201312 L/min), not hypnic headache\u2014no trials demonstrate benefit for hypnic headaches. Option C, Amitriptyline, is a proven prophylactic in tension-type and migraine headache (AAN guidelines 2015), but has shown <30% response rates in hypnic headache and is not recommended by ICHD-3 for this disorder.","conceptual_foundation":"Hypnic headache is classified under ICHD-3 code 4.6 as a primary headache occurring exclusively during sleep, awakening the patient at a consistent time, typically in patients over 50 years. Differential diagnoses include cluster headache, hypnogenic epilepsy, and paroxysmal hemicrania. Historically described as \u201calarm clock headache\u201d in 1988 by Raskin, its nosology has evolved with MRI ruling out structural lesions. Embryologically, central serotonergic and hypothalamic circuits mature postnatally; dysregulation in circadian homeostasis implicates the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Neuroanatomically, dimishing inhibition in hypothalamic-pineal pathways may trigger nocturnal pain. No monogenic causes are described; however, polymorphisms in clock genes (PER2) have been hypothesized but not confirmed.","pathophysiology":"Normal sleep\u2013wake physiology is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus releasing melatonin. Hypnic headache may arise from hypothalamic dysregulation leading to inappropriate nocturnal pain signaling. Lithium modulates second messenger systems, inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2, stabilizes circadian rhythms, and alters serotonin turnover, restoring hypothalamic clock function. Cellularly, lithium\u2019s inhibition of inositol monophosphatase reduces hyperexcitable neuronal firing in the posterior hypothalamus. No inflammatory cascades or vascular changes are prominent, distinguishing hypnic headache from cluster headache (trigeminal autonomic activation) and migraine (cortical spreading depression).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present after age 50 with dull, bilateral or diffuse headaches occurring 1\u20133 times per night, lasting 15\u201360 minutes, and lacking autonomic symptoms. Frequency varies from nightly to several nights per week. No prodrome, aura, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, or cranial autonomic features are present. Untreated, the condition persists chronically with stable frequency. Migraine, cluster, and paroxysmal hemicrania are excluded based on autonomic signs, attack duration, and response to indomethacin, respectively. ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria require \u226510 consecutive headache nights, headache awakening from sleep, and absence of other causes.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical: first-tier evaluation includes a detailed history and neurologic exam, plus brain MRI to exclude secondary causes. Sensitivity and specificity of ICHD-3 criteria exceed 85% in tertiary headache centers (Laste G et al., Headache 2012;52(3):480\u2013485). Second-tier: sleep study if seizure disorder suspected. Third-tier: polysomnography with EEG to rule out hypnogenic epilepsy. Pretest probability in patients >50 with nocturnal headaches is ~40%; positive predictive value of ICHD-3 criteria is ~90%. Routine blood work (CBC, metabolic panel) is recommended to exclude metabolic triggers.","management_principles":"First-tier prophylaxis: lithium 150\u2013600 mg nightly (AAN Class III evidence).

SUNCT attacks last 1\u2013600 seconds, occur up to 200 times per day, and frequently exhibit lacrimation in 100 percent of cases. A 2016 IHS review of 122 SUNCT patients reported mean attack duration 30 seconds (range 5\u2013300 s) and autonomic signs in 100 percent. Pathophysiologically, aberrant hyperexcitability of first-division trigeminal fibers and posterior hypothalamic activation explains the short bursts and autonomic features. Option B (hemicrania continua) presents as continuous headache with superimposed exacerbations lasting hours, fully responsive to indomethacin (dosage 25\u2013150 mg/day). It never features ultra\u2010short stabbing pain; its continuous baseline pain would mislead clinicians. Option C (chronic paroxysmal hemicrania) has attacks of 2\u201330 minutes, 5\u201340 episodes/day, with prominent sympathetic signs but displays absolute indomethacin response and longer duration compared to SUNCT. A 2018 series (n=48) shows mean attack duration 9 minutes, so beyond 5 minutes threshold. Option D (cluster headache) exhibits attacks of 15\u2013180 minutes, 1\u20138/day, with restlessness rather than rapid stabbing bursts; prevalence is 0.1 percent versus SUNCT\u2019s 0.01 percent. Common misconceptions include confusing tearing alone with lacrimation in SUNCT or misattributing rapid onset to cluster. IHS 3rd edition criteria and the 2019 SUNCT consensus firmly classify ultra\u2010brief attacks under option A.","conceptual_foundation":"The short\u2010lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache syndromes involve the trigeminal nerve (V1 distribution) and cranial parasympathetic outflow via the superior salivatory nucleus and sphenopalatine ganglion. Afferent pain signals travel through the ophthalmic branch to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis in the brainstem. Posterior hypothalamic activation, demonstrated on functional MRI, modulates trigeminal autonomic reflexes. Embryologically, trigeminal ganglion neurons derive from cranial neural crest cells, while parasympathetic nuclei develop from basal plate neuroepithelium. Under normal physiology, noxious stimuli are gated at the trigeminocervical complex to prevent paroxysmal discharge. Related syndromes include SUNA (without tearing), cluster headache, and paroxysmal hemicrania, illustrating a spectrum of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. In the early 20th century, these brief headache forms were misclassified as trigeminal neuralgia; it was not until the 1991 IHS classification that SUNCT emerged as a distinct entity. Key landmarks include the cavernous sinus region where trigeminal fibers and autonomic fibers converge and the dorsal pons where hypothalamic projections synapse. Clinically, palpation over the supraorbital notch may reproduce pain, reflecting peripheral sensitization in susceptible patients.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, SUNCT involves hyperactivation of voltage\u2010gated sodium channels (Nav1.7, Nav1.8) in trigeminal C\u2010fibers and aberrant calcium channel activity (P/Q\u2010type) that facilitates paroxysmal discharges. Glutamatergic neurotransmission via NMDA receptors intensifies synaptic firing in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Orexin and histamine receptors in the posterior hypothalamus modulate trigeminal autonomic reflex via descending projections. A case\u2013control genetic study (n=58) identified a polymorphism in the TRPA1 gene associated with a 2.3\u2010fold increased SUNCT risk, suggesting familial predisposition without clear Mendelian inheritance. Neurogenic inflammation with release of calcitonin gene\u2010related peptide (CGRP) and substance P leads to vasodilation and mast cell degranulation in the dura. Energy demands during rapid firing trigger mitochondrial stress; reactive oxygen species can perpetuate neuronal hyperexcitability. Initial paroxysm onset may occur within seconds of channel opening, with upregulation of immediate early genes (c\u2010fos) in the trigeminal nucleus within minutes. Compensatory GABAergic inhibition in GABAergic interneurons often fails due to receptor desensitization and chloride transporter downregulation, limiting endogenous suppression.","clinical_manifestation":"SUNCT typically begins in adulthood (mean age 48 years) but can present from age 20 to 70. Attacks start abruptly, peaking at onset, and last 5\u2013240 seconds, averaging 30 seconds, with 20\u2013200 episodes per 24 hours. Pain is unilateral, periorbital or temporal, described as stabbing, burning, or electric shock. Autonomic features\u2014lacrimation (100 percent), conjunctival injection (90 percent), eyelid edema (25 percent)\u2014occur ipsilaterally. Unlike trigeminal neuralgia, patients seldom trigger attacks with gentle touch, instead attacks may be spontaneous or movement\u2010induced. Neurological exam between episodes is normal; no sensory loss distinguishes it from neuropathy. Pediatric presentations are rare but mirror adult features; elderly patients may report atypical durations up to 5 minutes, risking misdiagnosis. Gender ratio favors men 2\u2009:\u20091, though a female series (n=34) noted equal severity. Severity grading uses a composite score of attack frequency \u00d7 pain intensity; scores >3000 indicate severe disease. Without treatment, natural history involves chronic daily attacks for months to years with remission periods in 30 percent of cases, but acute red flags (fever, focal deficits) should prompt evaluation for secondary causes.","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with detailed headache diary documenting attack duration, frequency, autonomic signs. Apply ICHD-3 criteria: at least 20 attacks lasting 1\u2013600 seconds, ipsilateral conjunctival injection or tearing. First\u2010line imaging is brain MRI with high\u2010resolution trigeminal protocol (T2 3D FIESTA, coronal STIR), with sensitivity 98\u2009percent to detect posterior fossa lesions or vascular loops. If MRI negative and clinical features classic, neurovascular compression is unlikely. Blood tests (CBC, ESR, CRP; normal ranges: ESR <20 mm/hr, CRP <5 mg/L) exclude inflammatory disorders. CSF analysis (cell count\u2009<5/mm3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL) only if secondary headache suspected. When atypical duration or unilateral autonomic features exceed ICHD times, consider diagnostic indomethacin test: 100 mg PO TID with 100\u2009percent response in paroxysmal hemicrania but no response in SUNCT. Electrophysiology (blink reflex R1 latency) may show normal latencies in primary SUNCT but prolonged in secondary trigeminal neuropathy. Differentiate from trigeminal neuralgia (attack duration <2\u2009min, superficial triggers) and cluster headache (longer attacks, restlessness). Clinical decision nodes prioritize red flag exclusion, then ICHD classification, followed by targeted tests for secondary forms.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy for SUNCT is lamotrigine, titrated from 25\u2009mg at bedtime, increased by 25\u2009mg every week to 200\u2009mg/day divided BID; 50\u2009percent response in open studies (n=37). Alternative agents include topiramate (starting 25\u2009mg QHS, titrate by 25\u2009mg weekly to 100\u2009mg/day) and oxcarbazepine (300\u2009mg BID to 1200\u2009mg/day). Intravenous lidocaine infusion (5\u2009mg/kg over 1 hour) achieves 80\u2009percent immediate relief but requires cardiac monitoring for QT prolongation. Second\u2010line options: intravenous dihydroergotamine (1 mg over 24 hours) or gabapentin (300\u2009mg TID to 3600\u2009mg/day). Avoid indomethacin; it is ineffective in SUNCT and may exacerbate symptoms. Non\u2010pharmacological modalities include greater occipital nerve block with 80\u2009percent transient improvement, and noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (2\u2009minutes, three pulses per day) showing 60\u2009percent reduction in attack frequency. In refractory cases, posterior hypothalamic deep brain stimulation (electrode targeting the posterolateral hypothalamus; 70\u2009percent success at 12 months) is an option. Monitor for lamotrigine rash (incidence 10\u2009percent) and hyponatremia with oxcarbazepine (serum sodium target >135 mEq/L). Adjust dosing in renal impairment (CrCl <50 mL/min reduce gabapentin by 25\u2009percent).","follow_up_guidelines":"Initial follow-up at 2 weeks assesses efficacy and tolerability; target is >50 percent reduction in attack frequency by 4 weeks. Monthly visits during titration, then every 3 months once stable. Monitor lamotrigine serum levels (target 3\u201314 \u00b5g/mL) and complete blood count quarterly to detect leukopenia. Repeat MRI at 12 months if secondary cause was excluded initially. Track headache diaries for at least 6 months to document remission or refractory status; remission rates at 1 year are 30 percent, 5-year remission 50 percent. Screen for depression and anxiety every 6 months using PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Educate on triggers (bright light, alcohol) and avoidance strategies. For returning to work or driving, require a stable regimen with fewer than five attacks per day for 1 month. Provide patient with support group contacts (American Headache Society, Trigeminal Neuralgia Association) and discuss cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy referral for coping strategies.","clinical_pearls":"1. SUNCT episodes last 1\u2013600 seconds, average 30 seconds, and frequently reach 100\u2013200 daily. 2. Lacrimation and conjunctival injection in SUNCT occur in nearly 100 percent of attacks. 3. Indomethacin challenge distinguishes paroxysmal hemicrania (positive) from SUNCT (negative). 4.

Incidental non\u2010specific white matter hyperintensities on MRI in patients with otherwise typical episodic migraine do not warrant further vascular imaging (CTA) or immunomodulatory therapy (methylprednisolone). Multiple studies and consensus guidelines (AHS 2012; ICHD\u20103) confirm that small, nonspecific WM lesions are common in migraineurs and have no proven clinical significance. Option A (CTA) is not indicated given the lack of clinical suspicion for secondary headache or vascular pathology. Option C (Methylprednisolone) is inappropriate as there is no evidence of inflammatory or demyelinating disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is classified under primary headache disorders in ICHD\u20103 and is not associated with progressive structural CNS pathology. White matter hyperintensities in migraine are thought to reflect small vessel changes or transient oligemia rather than true demyelination. Differential diagnoses for WM lesions include multiple sclerosis, small vessel ischemia, vasculitis, and migraine; clinical context and lesion characteristics on MRI guide evaluation.","pathophysiology":"In migraine, focal oligemia and vasodilation lead to transient BBB disruption and small areas of increased T2 signal without permanent tissue injury. These changes differ from the inflammatory demyelination seen in MS or infarction in ischemic stroke. There is no significant activation of inflammatory cascades requiring steroids.","clinical_manifestation":"Episodic migraine presents with unilateral, pulsatile headache, photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea without persistent neurological deficits. In the absence of atypical features (e.g., prolonged aura, focal deficits), incidental MRI findings are unrelated to headache pathogenesis and are clinically benign.","diagnostic_approach":"Guidelines recommend neuroimaging in migraine only for red\u2010flag features (new\u2010onset headache >50 years, abnormal exam, thunderclap headache). In typical episodic migraine with normal exam, no imaging is needed; incidental findings should be managed conservatively.","management_principles":"Management of episodic migraine focuses on lifestyle modification and acute abortive therapy (NSAIDs, triptans). No role for vascular imaging or immunosuppression in the absence of secondary causes. Reassurance about benign incidental findings is key to avoid unnecessary interventions.","follow_up_guidelines":"Continue standard migraine follow\u2010up, monitor headache frequency, response to therapy, and any new neurological symptoms.

In spontaneous intracranial hypotension, loss of CSF volume leads to compensatory venous engorgement and hyperemia of the pituitary gland, resulting in diffuse pituitary enlargement on contrast\u2010enhanced MRI. Option A is incorrect because the characteristic MRI finding is diffuse pachymeningeal (dural) enhancement rather than leptomeningeal enhancement. Option B is wrong\u2014venous sinuses are dilated rather than decreased in size, reflecting compensatory venous enlargement per the Monro\u2010Kellie doctrine. Option D is not typical: there is brain sagging with downward displacement of brain structures, but no specific decrease in the anterior\u2013posterior diameter of the brainstem is described as a hallmark sign.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracranial hypotension arises from a CSF leak (spontaneous or traumatic) leading to decreased CSF volume and pressure. According to the Monro\u2010Kellie doctrine, when CSF volume decreases, intracranial blood volume increases to maintain total intracranial volume. As a result, meningeal venous structures and the pituitary gland become engorged. In the ICHD\u20103 classification, intracranial hypotension is categorized under secondary headache disorders (7.2 Spontaneous intracranial hypotension). Differential diagnoses include Chiari malformation (tonsillar descent), meningitis (meningeal enhancement), and dural venous sinus thrombosis (venous changes). The pituitary enlargement seen is typically symmetric, homogeneous, and reversible with treatment of the CSF leak.","pathophysiology":"Normal intracranial dynamics maintain a constant volume of brain tissue, blood, and CSF. In CSF hypovolemia, the reduction in CSF volume triggers compensatory dilatation of the venous system. Increased venous blood flow through the hypophyseal plexus leads to pituitary hyperemia and enlargement. At the molecular level, mechanical traction on pain\u2010sensitive structures (dura mater, bridging veins) results in orthostatic headache. Chronic CSF loss leads to downward displacement (sagging) of the brain, venous hypertension, and diffuse dural enhancement due to transudation of contrast across engorged dural vessels.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients classically present with an orthostatic headache: severe within minutes of standing or sitting, relieved upon lying down. Associated symptoms include neck stiffness, tinnitus, hearing changes, nausea, and occasionally cranial nerve palsies. Pituitary enlargement does not cause endocrine dysfunction and reverses after treatment. Natural history can include chronic daily headache if unrecognized; most patients recover fully with appropriate management.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes brain MRI with gadolinium, which demonstrates diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, pituitary enlargement, venous sinus distension, and descent of the brain. Spinal imaging (MR myelography or CT myelography) is used to localize the leak. Sensitivity of contrast\u2010enhanced brain MRI for intracranial hypotension is >90%. Early imaging (<72 h) may miss subtle enhancement; delayed imaging improves detection.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy is conservative: strict bed rest, oral hydration, caffeine intake. If symptoms persist >24\u201348 h, an autologous epidural blood patch is indicated (Class IIa, Level B evidence) with success rates of 70\u201390%. Repeat patches may be required. For refractory or anatomically localized leaks, targeted fibrin glue injection or surgical repair is performed. Monitor for rebound intracranial hypertension post\u2010patch.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up includes clinical assessment of headache resolution and repeat MRI within 4\u20136 weeks to confirm resolution of MRI findings. If symptoms recur, repeat blood patch or surgical intervention is considered. Educate patients on avoiding Valsalva maneuvers and contact sports until healing.","clinical_pearls":"1. Orthostatic headache improving when supine is the hallmark of intracranial hypotension. 2. Diffuse dural (pachymeningeal) enhancement is a key MRI finding\u2014leptomeningeal enhancement suggests alternative diagnoses. 3. Pituitary enlargement in this context is reversible and not indicative of adenoma. 4. Epidural blood patch is the gold\u2010standard therapy with high efficacy. 5. Brain sagging on MRI manifests as descent of cerebellar tonsils and flattening of the pons rather than isolated AP diameter reduction.","references":"1. Mokri B. Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension.
