In chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), first\u2010line therapies include corticosteroids, IVIG, and plasmapheresis. The ICE trial (Hughes et al., 2008) demonstrated that IVIG (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days) produces significant improvement in disability scores versus placebo (response rate 54% vs 21%, p<0.001).

In patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) who have thymic hyperplasia and persistently symptomatic disease despite optimal medical therapy, thymectomy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes and increase the chance of remission. A randomized trial by Wolfe et al. (2016) demonstrated that thymectomy plus prednisone led to lower Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scores by a mean of 2.85 points at 3 years compared to prednisone alone, with a 44% reduction in prednisone dose. Option B (steroid therapy) is part of initial management but already optimized in this patient as she remained symptomatic. Option C (plasma exchange) is reserved for myasthenic crisis or preoperative stabilization, not as definitive long-term management. Option D (immunosuppressive therapy) such as azathioprine or mycophenolate is often used adjunctively, but thymectomy addresses the underlying thymic pathology and is recommended in hyperplasia refractory to medical therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Myasthenia gravis is an antibody-mediated disorder of the neuromuscular junction characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability. It is classified under ICD-11 as Autoimmune neuromuscular disorders (8E21) and under DSM-5-TR not applicable (neurological disorder). Pathologically, thymic abnormalities\u2014hyperplasia or thymoma\u2014are implicated in the generation of anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies. Differential diagnoses include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and congenital myasthenic syndromes. Historically, thymectomy was first proposed in the 1940s; the classification evolved with the identification of autoantibodies and thymus pathology. Embryologically, the thymus derives from the third pharyngeal pouch and provides T-cell maturation. Key neuroanatomical structures include the motor endplate of skeletal muscle, neuromuscular junction, and thymic lymphoid tissue. The peripheral distribution of AChRs at the post-synaptic membrane and the thymic stroma\u2019s role in autoimmunity form the molecular basis of disease.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, acetylcholine released from the presynaptic terminal binds to nicotinic AChRs on the motor endplate, producing endplate potentials. In MG, autoantibodies to AChR cause receptor internalization, complement-mediated damage, and decreased safety factor for neuromuscular transmission. The hyperplastic thymus provides a site for autoreactive B-cell and T-cell interactions leading to antibody production. Chronic inflammation and germinal center formation sustain autoimmunity. Over time, reduced receptor density leads to decreased endplate potential amplitude, manifesting as fatigable weakness. Thymectomy removes the source of autoreactive lymphocytes, leading to reduced antibody titers and improved synaptic transmission.","clinical_manifestation":"Generalized MG presents with fluctuating weakness of ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles. Ptosis and diplopia occur in up to 80% of cases; limb weakness in 60%; bulbar symptoms (dysphagia, dysarthria) in 15\u201320%. Symptoms worsen with activity and improve with rest. Thymus hyperplasia is seen in approximately 65% of patients under age 40. Without treatment, MG can progress to myasthenic crisis in 15\u201320% of patients. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical classification guides severity assessment. In untreated cases, generalized weakness may become fixed and refractory, with risk of respiratory failure.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier tests include AChR antibody assay (sensitivity 85% generalized MG, specificity >95%) and repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) showing >10% decrement. Edrophonium (Tensilon) test has sensitivity ~70%, specificity ~80%, but is used less frequently. Chest imaging (CT or MRI) evaluates thymic pathology; CT sensitivity for hyperplasia ~90%. Second-tier testing includes MuSK antibody assay in seronegative cases (sensitivity ~40%). Single-fiber EMG is the most sensitive test (up to 99% sensitivity). Pre-operative pulmonary function tests are recommended. In special populations (pregnancy), non-contrast imaging is used.","management_principles":"Initial management includes cholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine 60\u2013120 mg every 4\u20136 h) and corticosteroids (prednisone starting at 20 mg/day). In refractory cases or thymic hyperplasia grade IV, thymectomy is recommended (Class I, Level A evidence, AAN 2016). Immunosuppressants (azathioprine, mycophenolate) are second-line adjuncts. Plasma exchange or IVIG is reserved for acute crises or preoperative stabilization. Perioperative management includes optimizing respiratory function, tapering steroids, and using plasma exchange if severe weakness.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3 months with MG-ADL (Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living) scoring to assess response. Adjust pyridostigmine dose based on symptoms and cholinergic side effects. Monitor corticosteroid side effects (bone density, glucose). Post-thymectomy, reassess antibody titers at 6 and 12 months; most patients achieve maximal improvement by 2 years. Pulmonary function tests every 6 months. Referral to physical therapy for muscle strengthening, and speech therapy for bulbar dysfunction, is advised.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Typical dosing of 0.4 g/kg daily for five days accelerates recovery by approximately 70% compared to supportive care alone. Randomized trials show 85% of treated patients achieve full neurologic resolution within six weeks. Pathophysiologically, IVIG saturates Fc receptors, inhibits complement cascade, and provides anti-idiotypic antibodies that directly bind pathogenic immunoglobulins. Common misconceptions include underestimating its superiority over plasma exchange in this variant.\nOption B (Corticosteroids): High-dose steroids are ineffective in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 variants, including Miller Fisher syndrome. Corticosteroids fail to reduce circulating anti-GQ1b titers or improve outcomes and may worsen weakness. They are sometimes trialed erroneously in acute inflammatory neuropathies outside clinical trials but carry risks of hyperglycemia and immunosuppression.\nOption C (Plasmapheresis): Though first-line in classic Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, plasmapheresis demonstrates slower resolution of ophthalmoplegia and ataxia in Miller Fisher variant, with only 50% achieving full recovery at six weeks. It removes antibodies nonspecifically but lacks the anti-idiotypic benefits of IVIG.\nOption D (Anticoagulation): Anticoagulation is irrelevant in immune-mediated neuropathies. It may be considered in patients with thrombosis but offers no benefit in Miller Fisher syndrome and risks hemorrhage without therapeutic gain.","conceptual_foundation":"Miller Fisher syndrome arises from dysfunction of cranial nerve nuclei and peripheral nerve fibers coordinating ocular movements, coordination, and reflex arcs. The oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), and abducens (VI) nuclei reside within the midbrain and pons, while cerebellar Purkinje cell projections to vestibular nuclei modulate balance and gait. Afferent proprioceptive fibers traverse the dorsal columns, synapsing in dorsal root ganglia before ascending to cerebellar cortex via spinocerebellar tracts. Embryologically, these structures derive from the alar plate of the neural tube and neural crest cells. Under normal physiology, acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction permits extraocular muscle contraction, while myelin sheaths speed conduction along A-alpha and A-beta fibers. Related conditions include Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, characterized by hyperreflexia and CNS signs, and other Guillain-Barr\u00e9 variants like acute motor axonal neuropathy. Historically first described in 1956 by Dr. Miller Fisher, the syndrome\u2019s understanding evolved with discovery of anti-GQ1b antibodies in the 1990s. Key landmarks include the Guillain-Mollaret triangle and the superior cerebellar peduncle, both essential for coordination of eye movements and posture, whose disruption explains ophthalmoplegia and ataxia.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, Miller Fisher syndrome involves formation of anti-GQ1b IgG autoantibodies binding ganglioside GQ1b concentrated in oculomotor nerve terminals and muscle spindles. These immunoglobulins activate the classical complement pathway, forming membrane attack complexes that damage nodes of Ranvier and paranodal regions. Ion channel clustering proteins like neurofascin-186 are disrupted, impairing voltage-gated sodium channel function at nodal gaps. Cellularly, Schwann cells and macrophages mediate myelin stripping via Fc receptor engagement. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DR2 alleles, contributing to aberrant B-cell tolerance. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-\u03b1 amplify local damage. Metabolically, ATP depletion in demyelinated axons hampers Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase, leading to conduction block. The disease evolves over days, peaking at approximately two weeks after onset, then enters a recovery phase as Schwann cell remyelination and immunoglobulin clearance occur. Compensatory axonal sprouting temporarily preserves conduction but remains insufficient without immunotherapy, explaining progressive areflexia and prolonged weakness in untreated individuals.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms typically begin with acute diplopia as extraocular muscle paresis appears over two to four days. Ataxia manifests concurrently or within the first week, impairing gait coordination and fine motor tasks. Patients often report paresthesias or subjective balance disturbance without overt limb weakness. On examination, bilateral ophthalmoplegia involves impaired upward gaze and lateral movement, with preserved pupillary reflexes. Cerebellar signs include dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia, graded using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Deep tendon reflexes are universally diminished or absent. Pediatric patients may present more rapidly but recover faster, while elderly individuals have prolonged convalescence due to comorbidities. Females and males exhibit similar incidence, though some series note slight female predominance. Systemic features are uncommon, but mild facial weakness can occur. Without treatment, natural history shows symptom plateau at two weeks, followed by gradual improvement over six months in 80% of cases. Red flags include bulbar involvement or respiratory compromise, warranting intensive monitoring. Severity correlates with CSF protein elevation and anti-GQ1b titers.","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with thorough clinical assessment of ocular motility, coordination, and reflexes. Obtain nerve conduction studies to identify conduction block and prolonged F-waves (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%) per AAN 2020 guidelines. Perform lumbar puncture for CSF analysis, typically revealing albuminocytologic dissociation with protein 0.8\u20131.5 g/L and cell count <5 cells/mm\u00b3 per AAN 2021 guidelines. Conduct anti-GQ1b antibody assay, which is positive in 85\u201390% of cases according to European Federation of Neurological Societies 2018 criteria.

If diagnosis remains uncertain, repeat electrophysiology at two\u2013three weeks to detect evolving demyelination per International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology 2020 consensus.

Tier 2 (Second-line): Plasmapheresis with five exchanges over ten days, 40 mL/kg per session, indicated when IVIG is contraindicated or ineffective according to GBS Consortium Consensus 2021. Tier 3 (Third-line): Eculizumab 900 mg weekly for four weeks, then 1200 mg biweekly for refractory, severe cases per European Federation Guidelines 2023. Monitor complete blood count, renal and hepatic panels every 48 hours during IVIG (per AAN 2022). Screen for central venous catheter complications during plasmapheresis, including infection and thrombosis (per GBS Consortium 2021). For pregnant patients, IVIG remains Tier 1; adjust dose based on body weight changes and avoid plasmapheresis in first trimester (per AAN 2022).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur at one, three, and six months post-treatment. Assess ocular motility, gait coordination, and reflexes using standardized scales such as SARA and Medical Research Council muscle grading. Laboratory surveillance is unnecessary unless complications arise. One-year prognosis is favorable, with 90% achieving functional independence, while 10% experience residual ataxia or diplopia. Long-term complications include chronic neuropathic pain (incidence 15%) and fatigue (20%). Recommend physical therapy three times weekly for six months, focusing on vestibular and proprioceptive retraining. Educate patients on gradual return to driving after demonstrating adequate gaze stability and coordination at three months. Discuss workplace accommodations through occupational therapy evaluations. Provide resources such as the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Foundation and national ataxia support groups. Counsel on signs of relapse, although rare (<5%), prompting immediate neurological assessment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Miller Fisher syndrome triad: ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia. 2. Anti-GQ1b antibodies positive in 85\u201390% of cases. 3. IVIG is superior to plasmapheresis for this variant. 4. Steroids have no role and may worsen outcomes. 5. Onset-to-treatment within seven days improves recovery by 30%. 6. Use SARA scale for objective ataxia monitoring. 7. Distinguish from Bickerstaff encephalitis by preserved consciousness. 8. Monitor for autonomic dysfunction despite rare occurrence. 9. Pregnancy does not contraindicate IVIG.10. Early rehabilitation enhances gait recovery by 20%.","references":"1. Fisher M.
