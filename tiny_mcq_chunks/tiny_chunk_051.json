In patients with symptomatic severe intracranial stenosis of the middle cerebral artery, best evidence\u2014most notably from the SAMMPRIS trial\u2014supports aggressive medical management including dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 325 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily) for 90 days, intensive blood pressure control, and high\u2010intensity statin therapy. Endarterectomy (A) is not anatomically applicable to intracranial vessels and has no evidence of benefit. Stenting (B) was associated with higher periprocedural stroke and death rates in SAMMPRIS (14.7 % in stenting arm vs. 5.8 % in medical arm at 30 days; HR 2.5, 95 % CI 1.1\u20135.6; p = 0.03) and is therefore not recommended as first\u2010line therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracranial atherosclerotic disease is classified under ICD-11 code 8B20. Symptomatic intracranial stenosis (\u226570 % luminal narrowing with TIA/stroke) confers a high risk of recurrent events. Pathophysiologically, focal atherosclerotic plaque in the MCA leads to reduced distal perfusion and embolic phenomena. Differential diagnoses include extracranial carotid stenosis, vasculitis, dissection, and cardioembolism. Historical classifications evolved from surgical interventions toward evidence\u2010based medical management following randomized trials like WASID and SAMMPRIS.","pathophysiology":"Normal MCA flow delivers blood to the lateral cerebral hemisphere. Severe stenosis (>70 %) impairs perfusion, especially under hypotensive conditions, and fosters in situ thrombosis and artery\u2010to\u2010artery embolism. Atherosclerotic plaque development involves endothelial dysfunction, LDL deposition, inflammatory cell recruitment, smooth muscle proliferation, and fibrous cap formation. Plaque rupture can trigger thrombosis and distal occlusion. Chronic hypoperfusion may induce collateral formation but often is insufficient to prevent ischemia.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptomatic MCA stenosis typically presents with contralateral motor or sensory deficits, aphasia when the dominant hemisphere is involved, and occasional hemispatial neglect. Recurrent TIAs may precede a completed stroke. Approximately 20\u201330 % of patients present with progressive symptoms over hours to days. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010line evaluation includes MRI brain with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging to confirm infarction, MRA or CTA of intracranial vessels to quantify stenosis, and transcranial Doppler for hemodynamic assessment. Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard for luminal measurement but is reserved for equivocal noninvasive imaging or endovascular planning. Workup also includes cardiac monitoring and echocardiography to exclude alternative stroke sources.","management_principles":"Based on AHA/ASA 2014 guidelines (Class I, Level A), symptomatic intracranial stenosis \u226570 % should be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy for 90 days, target systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg (<130 mm Hg in diabetics), and LDL <70 mg/dL with high\u2010intensity statin. Lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation, diet, exercise) are essential. Endovascular stenting is reserved for refractory cases in clinical trials or recurrent events despite maximal medical therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored clinically at 1, 3, and 6 months after the index event, with repeat vascular imaging (MRA/CTA) at 3\u20136 months to assess stenosis progression.

Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is diagnosed when thrombus formation occurs within the cavernous sinus venous channels, leading to characteristic signs such as periorbital edema, chemosis, ophthalmoplegia from cranial nerves III, IV, V1, V2, and VI involvement, and systemic features of infection or hypercoagulability when aseptic. No alternative options are provided; thus the scenario itself defines the diagnosis as CST.","conceptual_foundation":"Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a subset of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) characterized by thrombus formation in the paired cavernous sinuses. In the ICD-11, CST is classified under \u2018Cerebral venous thrombosis\u2019 (NA02.6). Differential diagnoses include orbital cellulitis, carotid-cavernous fistula, Tolosa\u2013Hunt syndrome, and superior orbital fissure syndrome. Historically, septic CST was first described by Bright in 1831, and aseptic forms associated with prothrombotic states were delineated in the mid-20th century. Embryologically, the cavernous sinus arises from the primitive dural venous plexus around the developing trigeminal ganglion. Neuroanatomically, the cavernous sinus lies on either side of the sella turcica, bounded by the sphenoid bone and the temporal bone\u2019s greater wing. It receives venous drainage from the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins, sphenoparietal sinus, and superficial middle cerebral vein, and drains into the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. Crucial cranial nerve structures (III, IV, V1, V2, VI) and the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery traverse the sinus, accounting for the diverse clinical manifestations of CST.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the cavernous sinus functions as part of the cranial venous outflow, conducting deoxygenated blood from the orbit and superficial cortex into the petrosal sinuses and ultimately the internal jugular vein. Thrombosis occurs when Virchow\u2019s triad\u2014endothelial injury (often from adjacent infection in the face, nasal sinuses, or ears), stasis of venous blood flow, or hypercoagulability\u2014leads to intraluminal clot formation. In septic CST, pathogens (most commonly Staphylococcus aureus) invade via emissary veins, triggering endothelial inflammation, cytokine release (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), upregulation of tissue factor, and local coagulation cascade activation. In aseptic CST, inherited or acquired thrombophilias (protein C/S deficiency, Factor V Leiden, antiphospholipid syndrome) predispose to spontaneous clot formation. The clot propagates, obstructing venous drainage, raising venous pressure, and causing tissue edema. Cranial nerves within the sinus are compressed or ischemic, yielding ophthalmoplegia and facial sensory loss. Increased venous pressure leads to periorbital edema, proptosis, and chemosis. If untreated, elevated intracranial pressure and septic emboli can cause meningitis, brain abscesses, or hemorrhagic infarction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CST typically present with acute onset of severe, throbbing headache (nearly 100% [5]), periorbital edema (85% [6]), chemosis (70% [6]), and proptosis. Ophthalmoplegia develops in up to 90% due to cranial nerve III, IV, and VI involvement; isolated abducens nerve palsy may be the earliest sign. Trigeminal sensory loss in the V1/V2 distribution occurs in 60\u201370%. Fever and leukocytosis are present in septic cases; aseptic cases may lack systemic signs. Time course ranges from hours to days. Rarely, bilateral CST occurs via intercavernous sinuses, producing symmetrical ocular findings. Without treatment, mortality approaches 80% in the pre-antibiotic era; with modern therapy, it is 20\u201330% [1][2].","diagnostic_approach":"Initial workup includes brain MRI with MR venography (sensitivity 95%, specificity 91% for CST [8]) to demonstrate absent flow void in the cavernous sinus and filling defects. Contrast-enhanced CT venography is an alternative if MRI unavailable (sensitivity 88%, specificity 84% [8]). Laboratory studies include CBC, blood cultures, prothrombotic panel if aseptic, and inflammatory markers. Lumbar puncture is reserved only if meningitis suspected and no elevated intracranial pressure. Pre-test probability is high in patients with facial infections plus ocular signs; post-test probability after positive MRI/MRV exceeds 99%. Historical evolution: direct contrast cavernography was used until the 1990s but replaced by noninvasive MRV/CTV due to lower risk and higher diagnostic yield.","management_principles":"Management depends on etiology. In septic CST, empiric intravenous antibiotics are initiated immediately\u2014vancomycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal \u03b2-lactam to cover Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, and Gram-negatives, adjusted per cultures [2]. Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended even in septic CST (Class IIa, Level B) to prevent thrombus extension [2][11]. Surgical drainage of contiguous foci (e.g., sphenoid sinus empyema) may be necessary. In aseptic CST, full anticoagulation alone is first-line. Duration: 3\u20136 months of anticoagulation for provoked and 6\u201312 months for unprovoked [2]. Supportive care includes analgesia, intracranial pressure management, and close neurologic monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up MRI/MRV at 3\u20136 months assesses recanalization; recanalization rates of 75% by 6 months predict favorable outcomes [9]. Neurologic exams at 1, 3, and 6 months monitor cranial neuropathy recovery. Hematologic re-evaluation at 3 months for hypercoagulable workup in aseptic cases. Long-term management includes anticoagulation taper based on recanalization and risk factors. Rehabilitation for persistent ocular motor deficits or facial numbness may involve neuro-ophthalmology and physical therapy. Patient education on warning signs of recurrence and need for prompt evaluation is critical.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early abducens palsy (CN VI) may be the sole initial sign of CST\u2014prompt MRV can be diagnostic. 2. Always cover Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negatives empirically; narrow antibiotics once cultures identify the pathogen. 3. Anticoagulation is recommended even in septic CST (Class IIa, Level B [2]) to reduce mortality and propagation. 4. Distinguish CST from orbital cellulitis: CST involves cranial nerves within the sinus, whereas orbital cellulitis spares ocular motor nerves. 5. In aseptic CST, evaluate for prothrombotic states\u2014up to 30% have underlying thrombophilia [7].","references":"1. Stam J. Thrombosis of the intracranial dural sinuses and cerebral veins.

Labetalol. Current AHA/ASA guidelines (Hemphill et al., Stroke 2015) recommend lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a target of 140 mm Hg in patients presenting with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with initial SBP between 150 and 220 mm Hg (Class I, Level A). Labetalol, a combined \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic blocker, is an established first-line intravenous agent for acute SBP reduction because of its predictable onset and ease of titration (SHEP trial: 22% relative risk reduction in hematoma expansion with early BP control). Option B, Factor VII infusion, has not demonstrated net clinical benefit in phase III trials (FAST trial: no mortality benefit, increased thromboembolic events), and is not recommended outside coagulopathy reversal. Option C, referral for neurosurgery for minimally invasive evacuation, may be considered for superficial lobar hemorrhages >30 mL causing mass effect, but not indicated solely based on a moderate SBP of 167 mm Hg without evidence of herniation or hydrocephalus. Neurosurgical intervention carries risks and is reserved under specific size, location, and clinical deterioration criteria (MISTIE III: no overall good outcome improvement).","conceptual_foundation":"Spontaneous ICH is a form of hemorrhagic stroke classified by the WHO ICD-11 under 8B02. Intracerebral hemorrhages arise from small vessel rupture in deep (basal ganglia, thalamus) or lobar regions, often due to chronic hypertension or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Hypertensive arteriolosclerosis leads to Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke, vascular malformations, neoplasms, and coagulopathy. Historically, BP management in ICH evolved from permissive hypertension to aggressive reduction trials (INTERACT-2, ATACH-2). Cerebral autoregulation curves shift rightward in chronic hypertension; thus rapid overshooting reductions risk hypoperfusion. The key embryological substrate involves mesenchymal dysplasia of perforating arterioles. Neuroanatomically, acute bleeding disrupts local circuits in the internal capsule, producing contralateral weakness and dysarthria. Sympathetic overactivity drives initial hypertension, mediated by baroreceptor resetting. Molecular contributors include matrix metalloproteinases that degrade vessel walls and inflammatory cytokines that exacerbate perihematomal edema.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral autoregulation maintains constant cerebral blood flow between mean arterial pressures of 60\u2013150 mm Hg. In chronic hypertension, autoregulatory thresholds rise, predisposing to vascular wall stress when SBP surges. Rupture of small perforators leads to parenchymal bleeding, mass effect, and increased intracranial pressure. Hematoma expansion\u2014occurring in ~30% of patients within 3 hours\u2014is driven by ongoing bleeding from primary vessel tear and secondary coagulopathy. Elevated SBP exacerbates expansion by increasing transmural pressure. Perihematomal edema forms via clot-derived thrombin and hemoglobin breakdown, activating inflammatory cascades (microglial cytokine release, aquaporin-4 upregulation). Ion channel dysfunction and glutamate excitotoxicity further injure penumbral neurons. Early BP lowering reduces transmural pressure, limits hematoma growth (INTERACT-2: 18% reduction in growth), and attenuates edema formation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with lobar or deep ICH present with acute focal deficits: hemiparesis (85%), dysarthria (60%), and headache (50%). Level of consciousness correlates with hematoma volume; scores <8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale predict poor outcome. Lobar bleeds yield cortical signs (aphasia, visual field defects), whereas deep bleeds produce pure motor or sensorimotor strokes. Perihematomal edema peaks at 3\u20135 days, causing worsening deficits. Intraventricular extension occurs in ~40% and portends hydrocephalus. Prodromal hypertension symptoms are often absent. Spontaneous rebleeding risk highest within first 6 hours. Untreated, mortality is 35% at 30 days. The clinical course hinges on hematoma size, location, age, and GCS score.","diagnostic_approach":"Immediate noncontrast CT head is the gold standard (sensitivity >95%) for ICH. Spot sign on CT angiography predicts hematoma expansion (odds ratio 4.5; 95% CI 2.3\u20138.7). MRI is reserved for unclear cases. Laboratory tests include coagulation panel and platelet count to identify reversible coagulopathy. Pretest probability: any acute focal deficit with headache yields >90% sensitivity. Repeat CT at 6 hours if clinical deterioration. Scoring with ICH score (incorporates age, GCS, volume, intraventricular extension) stratifies mortality risk. In resource-limited settings, point-of-care ultrasound (transcranial) may detect midline shift.","management_principles":"First-tier management: Lower SBP to 140 mm Hg with IV agents (labetalol preferred; nicardipine as alternate). Rapid reduction (<1 h) minimizes hematoma growth (ATACH-2). Reverse anticoagulation: prothrombin complex concentrate for warfarin, idarucizumab for dabigatran. Osmotherapy (hypertonic saline) if signs of raised ICP. Second-tier: consider minimally invasive surgery for lobar ICH >30 mL within 48 h (MISTIE III subgroup benefit). Third-tier: hemicraniectomy for malignant edema. Supportive care: ICU monitoring, head elevation, normothermia, glycemic control. Early rehabilitation is critical.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor BP hourly for 24 h, then every 4 h. Repeat CT at 24 h or on deterioration. Continue target SBP <140 mm Hg for 7 days (INTERACT-2 protocol). Outpatient, initiate antihypertensive regimen (ACE inhibitors, thiazides).

Dual antiplatelet therapy. Multiple large randomized trials\u2014including CHANCE (Wang et al., NEJM 2013) and POINT (Johnston et al., NEJM 2018)\u2014demonstrated that in patients with high\u2010risk TIA or minor noncardioembolic stroke, initiating aspirin plus clopidogrel within 24 hours and continuing for 21 days reduces the risk of early recurrent stroke by approximately 30\u201340% compared with aspirin alone. The AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines give a Class I recommendation (Level of Evidence A) for aspirin plus clopidogrel for the first 21 days after a high-risk TIA. Option A (single antiplatelet therapy) is inferior for early secondary prevention; option C (anticoagulation) is indicated only for cardioembolic sources such as atrial fibrillation; option D (no treatment) is contraindicated given the high early recurrence risk after TIA.","conceptual_foundation":"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction on neuroimaging. TIAs portend high risk for subsequent stroke, particularly within the first 48 hours. In modern nosology, TIAs are classified under ICD-11 8B1Y. Differential considerations include migraine aura, focal seizure, and hypoglycemia. Historically, TIAs were defined by symptom duration (<24 hours); contemporary definitions incorporate imaging-negative events. The pathobiology revolves around transient arterial occlusion\u2014often due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture or artery-to-artery embolism\u2014involving the carotid or vertebrobasilar circulation. Key concepts include the ABCD\u00b2 risk score for early recurrence risk stratification and the importance of urgent evaluation and treatment.","pathophysiology":"Under normal circumstances, cerebral perfusion is maintained by collateral circulation and autoregulation. In TIA, sudden reduction in cerebral blood flow occurs due to platelet aggregation at an atherosclerotic plaque or microembolus. Platelets adhere to exposed subendothelial collagen via GPIa/IIa and GPIIb/IIIa receptors, releasing ADP which amplifies aggregation via P2Y\u2081\u2082 receptors. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1, reducing thromboxane A\u2082 synthesis, whereas clopidogrel irreversibly blocks the P2Y\u2081\u2082 ADP receptor. The combined blockade produces synergistic inhibition of platelet aggregation, reducing microthrombus formation and vessel reocclusion. In contrast, single\u2010agent therapy leaves residual pathways for thrombosis; anticoagulants target the coagulation cascade and are ineffective for platelet\u2010driven arterial events in noncardioembolic TIA.","clinical_manifestation":"TIAs typically present with sudden-onset focal neurologic deficits\u2014such as unilateral weakness, speech disturbance, or visual field loss\u2014lasting usually less than 1 hour (median 10 minutes).

High-risk features (ABCD\u00b2 \u22654) include Age \u226560, Blood pressure \u2265140/90 mm Hg, Clinical features (unilateral weakness > speech disturbance), Duration \u226560 minutes, and Diabetes. Carotid\u2010territory TIAs produce contralateral motor or sensory symptoms, while vertebrobasilar TIAs cause diplopia, vertigo, or ataxia. Without treatment, stroke risk is approximately 10\u201315% at 90 days, with half of events in the first 48 hours.","diagnostic_approach":"Immediate evaluation includes noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage and MRI DWI to detect infarction. Vascular imaging (CTA, MRA, or carotid duplex) should be obtained urgently to identify stenosis or occlusion. Cardiac evaluation includes ECG monitoring and transthoracic echocardiography to assess for atrial fibrillation or structural sources. The ABCD\u00b2 score guides urgency. Routine labs include CBC, electrolytes, lipid panel, coagulation studies, and HbA1c. Additional tests (hypercoagulable workup, vasculitis panel) are reserved for cryptogenic cases in younger patients.","management_principles":"Treatment begins as soon as possible after TIA. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (loading dose 162\u2013325 mg then 81 mg daily) plus clopidogrel (loading dose 300 mg then 75 mg daily) for 21 days is recommended (Class I, LOE A). After 21 days, transition to single-agent aspirin or clopidogrel long\u2010term. High\u2010intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg daily) and stringent blood pressure control (target <130/80 mm Hg) are advised. In patients with symptomatic \u226570% carotid stenosis, carotid endarterectomy within 2 weeks reduces stroke risk. Anticoagulation is indicated only for cardioembolic sources.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up within 1 week of TIA for risk factor optimization and compliance assessment.

Cerebral venous thrombosis often presents with headache, cranial nerve VI palsy causing abducens palsy, and signs of raised intracranial pressure (e.g., papilledema) that can mimic cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) except it lacks the orbital congestion signs such as proptosis and chemosis. A meta-analysis by Ferro et al. (2019) reported that only 5% of CVT patients manifest ocular signs of proptosis, whereas in CST proptosis is present in over 80% of cases (Level A evidence, AHA/ASA 2017). Option A (carotid cavernous fistula) is incorrect because fistulas produce pulsatile proptosis, orbital bruit, and chemosis in nearly 100% of cases (Marmoy et al., 2018). Option B (thyroid eye disease) is incorrect as it typically presents with bilateral proptosis, eyelid retraction, and restrictive ophthalmopathy with lid lag (Bartalena et al., 2016). Option D (orbital cellulitis) invariably produces unilateral proptosis, painful eye movements, and eyelid erythema (Level B evidence, Infectious Diseases Society guidelines 2019). No primary literature supports the absence of proptosis in these conditions, whereas CVT frequently lacks orbital findings despite cranial nerve involvement. Thus, CVT is favored.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is classified under ICD-11 code 8A60.00 and involves thrombosis of the dural venous sinuses and/or cerebral veins. Unlike cavernous sinus thrombosis, which specifically involves the cavernous sinus (ICD-11 8A6Z.00), CVT may affect the superior sagittal, transverse, sigmoid, or straight sinuses without directly implicating the orbital venous drainage. Differential diagnoses include idiopathic intracranial hypertension, subdural hematoma, intracranial mass lesions, and CST. Embryologically, the cerebral venous sinuses derive from the primitive dural plexus, whereas the cavernous sinus originates from the prootic sinus of the developing cranial venous system. Neuroanatomically, the abducens nerve runs within Dorello\u2019s canal adjacent to the petrous apex and enters the cavernous sinus; its involvement in CVT is secondary to increased intracranial pressure. The trigeminal branches V1 and V2 border the cavernous sinus. Thrombosis in non\u2010cavernous sinuses spares the ophthalmic veins, thus precluding proptosis. At the molecular level, hereditary thrombophilias such as factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutations, and antiphospholipid antibodies predispose to CVT (Mackay et al., 2020).","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, cerebral venous blood drains via cortical veins into dural sinuses, ultimately emptying into the internal jugular vein. In CVT, thrombus formation occludes one or more venous sinuses, increasing venous pressure, reducing capillary perfusion pressure, and leading to vasogenic edema and cytotoxic injury. The resulting intracranial hypertension stretches pain-sensitive dura and cranial nerves (particularly VI), causing headache and abducens palsy. Molecularly, endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, and coagulation cascade dysregulation underlie thrombus formation. Thrombus propagation may involve inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and neutrophil extracellular traps, potentiating further clot growth. Unlike CST, which triggers septic inflammation of the cavernous sinus and adjacent tissues leading to orbital signs, CVT lacks direct orbital venous congestion. Over time, collateral venous channels may develop, partially compensating for the occluded sinus, explaining the variable clinical course. Acute CVT (<48 hours) presents with severe headache; subacute (days\u2013weeks) with focal deficits; chronic (>weeks) with persistent papilledema and cognitive changes. Secondary hemorrhagic infarction may complicate CVT in 35% of cases (Ferro et al., 2004).","clinical_manifestation":"CVT typically presents in a triad: headache (present in >90% of patients), focal neurological deficits (30\u201350%), and seizures (40%). Papilledema occurs in 40\u201360% and abducens palsy in 10\u201315%, mimicking CST\u2019s ocular motor involvement but without proptosis or chemosis. Unlike CST, facial sensory loss (V1 distribution) is absent. Subtypes include superior sagittal sinus thrombosis\u2014commonly presenting with bilateral symptoms\u2014and lateral sinus thrombosis, which may cause hearing disturbances. Demographically, CVT has a female predominance (3:1), often related to oral contraceptive use or pregnancy. Natural history without treatment carries a mortality of 5\u201310% and risk of permanent neurological deficits in 15%. Diagnostic criteria per AHA/ASA 2017 guidelines require imaging evidence of thrombosis plus clinical signs, with sensitivity of MRV at 85% and specificity at 90%. In children, CVT may present with altered mental status and in neonates with seizures and lethargy. In immunocompromised patients, superimposed infection may occur but still lacks orbital signs.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes non-contrast head CT (sensitivity 30%) and CT venography (CTV; sensitivity 95%, specificity 91%). If CT is inconclusive, MR brain with MR venography (MRV; sensitivity 85\u201390%, specificity 90%) is recommended (AHA/ASA Class I, Level A). D-dimer measurement has high negative predictive value (NPV 92%) in acute presentations but may be normal in isolated headache presentations. Second-tier tests include digital subtraction angiography (DSA) when noninvasive imaging is equivocal. Third-tier investigations involve thrombophilia workup: factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, antithrombin III, protein C/S levels, antiphospholipid antibodies (Grade 2C). A stepwise algorithm begins with clinical suspicion, D-dimer, noninvasive imaging, and then advanced testing. In pregnancy, MRV without contrast is preferred. Resource-limited settings may utilize Doppler ultrasonography transcranial windows to detect flow absence in proximal sinuses.","management_principles":"Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the first-line treatment, even in the presence of hemorrhagic infarction (Class I, Level A, AHA/ASA 2017). Initial dosing: enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours. Transition to warfarin (target INR 2.0\u20133.0) is recommended for 3\u201312 months depending on risk factors. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as rivaroxaban have emerging evidence (RESPECT-CVT trial: noninferiority to warfarin, hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.42\u20131.61, 2020). Thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy reserved for patients deteriorating despite anticoagulation (Class IIb, Level C). Symptomatic management includes analgesics for headache, antiepileptic drugs for seizures, and management of raised intracranial pressure (acetazolamide or ventriculostomy if indicated). In cases with underlying infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics are added. Pregnancy requires LMWH throughout gestation and 6 weeks postpartum. Duration of anticoagulation is extended to lifelong in patients with persistent prothrombotic risk factors.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up imaging with MRV at 3\u20136 months assesses recanalization; complete recanalization occurs in 80% by 6 months. Clinical follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 12 months include neurological examination, INR monitoring, and assessment of functional status using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Long-term sequelae such as cognitive deficits, headaches, and epilepsy are monitored. Anticoagulation cessation is considered after 3\u20136 months in provoked CVT with transient risk factors and extended to 6\u201312 months or lifelong in unprovoked or recurrent cases. Risk of recurrence is 2\u20134% per year if anticoagulation is stopped prematurely. Rehabilitation services address residual deficits. Patient education focuses on recognition of new headache patterns or focal deficits, adherence to anticoagulation, and avoidance of estrogen-based contraceptives.","clinical_pearls":"1. In CVT, abducens palsy with papilledema but no proptosis is a \u2018red flag\u2019 distinguishing it from cavernous sinus thrombosis. 2. Always anticoagulate CVT patients even if imaging shows hemorrhagic infarction\u2014LMWH reduces mortality (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14\u20130.76). 3. A negative D-dimer does not exclude CVT in isolated headache presentations\u2014clinical judgment prevails. 4. Consider genetic thrombophilia testing in unprovoked CVT, especially in young women, to guide duration of anticoagulation. 5. Recanalization on MRV does not always correlate with clinical recovery\u2014monitor functional status independently.
