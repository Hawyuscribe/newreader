She was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. She has a history of a prior left lower deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and a small patent foramen ovale (PFO) was also found. What is the appropriate management?","options":["DAPT","Warfarin","Closure of PFO","ASA ## Page 9"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Warfarin","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Warfarin. Evidence-based guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) (2014) recommend long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy with a target INR of 2.0\u20133.0 for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) who have experienced a thrombotic event (Class I, Level of Evidence B) [1]. Meta-analyses demonstrate that warfarin reduces the risk of recurrent thrombosis by approximately 70% compared to no anticoagulation (pooled RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18\u20130.50) [2].\n\nOption A (DAPT) is incorrect: dual antiplatelet therapy does not address the pathophysiology of APS, which is antibody-mediated hypercoagulability. Trials in stroke patients without APS show only modest benefit for DAPT in the acute setting and no role in secondary prevention of APS-related thrombosis [3].\n\nOption C (Closure of PFO) is incorrect: PFO closure reduces paradoxical embolic strokes in selected patients with cryptogenic stroke but does not treat the underlying hypercoagulable state in APS. There are no randomized controlled trials demonstrating benefit of PFO closure in APS patients over anticoagulation alone [4].\n\nOption D (ASA) is incorrect: aspirin monotherapy is insufficient for secondary prevention in APS. Observational cohorts show recurrence rates of 20\u201330% per year on aspirin alone versus less than 5% per year on warfarin (INR 2\u20133) [5].\n\nThus, warfarin remains the standard of care for secondary prevention in thrombotic APS.","conceptual_foundation":"Antiphospholipid syndrome is classified in the ICD-11 under \u2018Subcategory 1B00.4 Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura and antiphospholipid syndrome.\u2019 According to the revised Sapporo (Sydney) criteria, APS diagnosis requires at least one clinical event (vascular thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity) and persistent laboratory positivity for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, or anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I (\u226512 weeks apart) [6]. Primary APS occurs without another autoimmune disease; secondary APS is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune conditions. Differential diagnoses include inherited thrombophilias (Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and malignancy-associated hypercoagulability.\n\nEmbryologically, \u03b22-glycoprotein I is synthesized in the liver and circulates in plasma, binding negatively charged phospholipids. Neurovascular implications stem from antibody-mediated endothelial activation, complement fixation, and clot formation in cerebral arteries and veins. APS overlaps with other prothrombotic states and may present with ischemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or transient ischemic attacks. Recognition of the disorder requires integration of immunology, hematology, and cerebral vascular anatomy.","pathophysiology":"Normal hemostasis balances procoagulant and anticoagulant forces. In APS, antibodies against \u03b22-glycoprotein I and cardiolipin bind to phospholipid surfaces on platelets and endothelial cells, causing upregulation of tissue factor expression, release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-\u03b1), and activation of complement C5a leading to thrombus formation [7].\n\nOn the molecular level, anti-\u03b22-GPI antibodies crosslink \u03b22-GPI on endothelial surfaces, triggering p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways, which increase expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1) and tissue factor. This promotes fibrin deposition and platelet aggregation. Complement activation via the classical pathway amplifies local inflammation and thrombosis. The combined effect is a hypercoagulable state, with both arterial and venous thromboses.\n\nWarfarin antagonizes vitamin K\u2013dependent \u03b3-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, reducing thrombin generation and fibrin formation. By maintaining INR 2.0\u20133.0, warfarin mitigates the prothrombotic signaling cascade perpetuated by antiphospholipid antibodies.","clinical_manifestation":"APS classically presents with venous thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis in 30\u201350%), arterial events (stroke, myocardial infarction in 20\u201330%), and less commonly, microvascular thrombosis leading to livedo reticularis or renal thrombotic microangiopathy [8]. Stroke is often recurrent and may involve multiple vascular territories. Patients can also exhibit transient ischemic attacks, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (5\u201310%), and rarely, Catastrophic APS (<1%), marked by multiorgan failure over days.\n\nProdromal symptoms are uncommon. Thrombotic events usually occur in young to middle-aged adults, with a female predominance (3:1). Recurrence rates without adequate anticoagulation exceed 20% per year. The presence of high-titer double or triple antibody positivity (lupus anticoagulant plus both anticardiolipin and anti-\u03b22-GPI) confers the highest risk (adjusted HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.7\u20134.6) [9].","diagnostic_approach":"A structured approach begins with clinical suspicion in patients with young onset stroke or unprovoked thrombosis. Laboratory testing per ISTH guidelines includes lupus anticoagulant functional assays (dilute Russell\u2019s viper venom time, kaolin clotting time), anticardiolipin IgG/IgM ELISA, and anti-\u03b22-GPI IgG/IgM ELISA, repeated at least 12 weeks later to confirm persistence (Grade 1B) [6].\n\nNeuroimaging (MRI/MRA) characterizes infarct pattern; cerebral venography if venous sinus thrombosis is suspected. Echocardiography with bubble study evaluates PFO; however, in APS patients, PFO closure trials have not shown reduction in recurrent arterial events beyond anticoagulation. Pretest probability scoring (e.g., adjusted Global APS Score) may refine testing yield. False positives can occur in acute inflammation or anticoagulated patients; defer testing until 2\u20134 weeks after the acute event and after warfarin has been held or reversed if feasible to avoid confounding results.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for thrombotic APS is a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) targeting an INR of 2.0\u20133.0 indefinitely (AHA/ASA Class I, LOE B) [1]. A cohort study (n=210) showed warfarin reduced recurrent thrombosis to 3.5% per year versus 18% per year on aspirin alone (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10\u20130.34) [5]. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have demonstrated higher recurrent thrombosis rates in APS, especially in triple-positive patients (TRAPS trial: rivaroxaban vs warfarin HR 3.88, 95% CI 1.50\u201310.01), and are not recommended (EULAR 2019) [10].\n\nNon-pharmacological measures include risk factor modification (smoking cessation, control of hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and minimization of estrogen exposures. Thromboprophylaxis should include low-molecular-weight heparin in high-risk settings (surgery, pregnancy). PFO closure is reserved for non-APS cryptogenic stroke populations; it is not indicated here.\n\nRegular patient education on medication adherence, bleeding risk, and recognition of new thromboses is essential. Pregnancy management requires low-molecular-weight heparin with or without aspirin, not warfarin, due to teratogenicity.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients on warfarin require INR monitoring at least every 4 weeks once stable. Target INR is 2.0\u20133.0; time in therapeutic range >60% is associated with optimal outcomes (RR of recurrence 0.25, 95% CI 0.12\u20130.52) [11]. Annual clinical evaluations should assess for new thrombotic events, bleeding complications, and comorbidities. Repeat antiphospholipid antibody testing every 6\u201312 months is optional, as titers do not guide duration of therapy.\n\nIn the setting of major bleeding, hold warfarin and administer vitamin K or prothrombin complex concentrate. Reinitiate anticoagulation once bleeding risk is mitigated. Surveillance imaging (vascular ultrasound, brain MRI) is not routinely recommended unless clinically indicated. Patient self-monitoring programs may improve time in therapeutic range in select populations.","clinical_pearls":"1. In thrombotic APS, indefinite warfarin (INR 2\u20133) reduces recurrence by >70% versus no anticoagulation; DOACs are contraindicated in triple positivity.\n2. Aspirin monotherapy or DAPT is insufficient for APS-related stroke prevention.\n3. High-titer triple antibody positivity confers the highest thrombotic risk (HR 2.8), guiding aggressive management.\n4. PFO closure has no benefit over anticoagulation in APS; closure is reserved for non-APS cryptogenic stroke.\n5. Repeat aPL testing must be \u226512 weeks apart to confirm persistent positivity (Sydney criteria).","references":"1. Suri MF, et al.

Transcortical sensory aphasia. Thalamic aphasia classically presents with relatively preserved fluency and repetition but impaired comprehension and naming, mirroring the repetition\u2010preserving profile of transcortical sensory aphasia. In transcortical sensory aphasia, lesions are extrasylvian and disconnect Wernicke\u2019s area from surrounding cortex, preserving the perisylvian repetition circuit. Similarly, thalamic lesions disrupt thalamocortical projection pathways involved in semantic processing and comprehension while sparing the dorsal language repetition network. Option B (Broca\u2019s aphasia) is incorrect because Broca\u2019s aphasia is nonfluent with impaired repetition. Option C (Wernicke\u2019s aphasia) is incorrect because Wernicke\u2019s aphasia features fluent speech with severely impaired repetition due to perisylvian involvement. Option D (Global aphasia) is incorrect because it shows severe impairment of fluency, comprehension, and repetition.","conceptual_foundation":"Aphasia denotes an acquired language disorder due to focal brain injury. The classical perisylvian model divides aphasias into fluent and nonfluent types based on lesion location relative to the sylvian fissure. Transcortical sensory aphasia is a fluent subtype with preserved repetition resulting from extrasylvian posterior lesions isolating Wernicke\u2019s area but sparing the arcuate fasciculus and perisylvian cortex. Thalamic aphasia arises from strategic lesions in the dominant thalamus\u2014most often the pulvinar or anterior nucleus\u2014disrupting thalamocortical feedback to temporal lobe language areas, yielding a clinical picture of fluent speech, semantic paraphasias, impaired comprehension, and intact repetition.","pathophysiology":"Normal language processing depends on cortical networks in frontal (Broca\u2019s) and temporal (Wernicke\u2019s) areas interconnected by the arcuate fasciculus and modulated by cortico\u2010subcortical loops through the thalamus. Thalamic injury interrupts thalamocortical projections carrying semantic and lexical information to Wernicke\u2019s region without affecting the dorsal repetition stream, leading to comprehension deficits with preserved repetition. In contrast, lesions directly involving the arcuate fasciculus (as in Wernicke\u2019s or conduction aphasia) impair repetition.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with thalamic aphasia are often alert and cooperative, produce fluent speech with paraphasic errors and neologisms, have marked deficits in auditory comprehension and naming tasks, but can repeat multisyllabic words, phrases, and sentences with relative ease. They may demonstrate preserved reading aloud but impaired reading comprehension. Spontaneous speech rate is maintained (around 100\u2013120 words per minute), though content may be empty or jargon-filled.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes bedside language assessment\u2014fluency, naming, comprehension, repetition\u2014and neuroimaging with MRI to identify thalamic infarct or hemorrhage. Diffusion\u2010weighted MRI demonstrates restricted diffusion in thalamic nuclei.

In asymptomatic children with sickle cell anemia, elevated TCD velocities (>200 cm/s) correlate with a 10% annual stroke risk as demonstrated in the STOP trial (Adams et al. 1998). TCD captures dynamic hemodynamic changes uniquely in sickle cell disease and provides validated thresholds for stroke prevention.\n\nOption B: CT Angiography (CTA) offers high-resolution imaging of vessel lumen and wall, useful for structural stenosis or acute post-stroke evaluation. However, CTA involves ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast, limiting serial pediatric screening. CTA lacks prospective, velocity-based predictive criteria for stroke risk in sickle cell anemia.\n\nOption C: MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging detects silent infarcts and chronic ischemic changes in up to 90% of affected patients. While critical for diagnosing established injury, MRI does not yield quantitative flow velocities required to stratify future stroke risk and is used only after abnormal TCD screening.\n\nOption D: Carotid duplex ultrasound assesses extracranial carotid bifurcation stenosis in atherosclerotic disease. In sickle cell anemia, intracranial arteriopathy predominates. Carotid ultrasonography correlates poorly with cerebral flow compromise in pediatric patients and is not validated for stroke risk prediction in this population.","conceptual_foundation":"The circle of Willis and its proximal branches (middle cerebral artery [MCA], anterior cerebral artery [ACA], and internal carotid arteries) supply most cerebral hemispheric perfusion. Embryologically, the dorsal aorta forms the internal carotid system by week 4\u20135; failure of complete remodeling predisposes to collateral vessel variants. Cerebral autoregulation maintains constant flow between perfusion pressures of 50\u2013150 mm Hg via arteriolar constriction or dilation mediated by myogenic, metabolic, and endothelial factors (nitric oxide, prostacyclin). In sickle cell anemia, chronic hemolysis, nitric oxide depletion, and endothelial dysfunction accelerate intimal hyperplasia and luminal narrowing of intracranial vessels. Historical understanding shifted after the 1998 STOP trial pioneered TCD screening to identify at-risk children, leading to prophylactic transfusion protocols. Key anatomical landmarks include the M1 segment of the MCA for reliable TCD windows, the anterior communicating artery for collateral flow, and the circle\u2019s posterior communicating branches. Recognition of these structures underpins risk stratification and guides sonographic probe placement for velocity measurement.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, the \u03b26 Glu\u2192Val mutation in the HBB gene (chromosome 11p15.5) leads to hemoglobin S polymerization under deoxygenated conditions. Sickled erythrocytes adhere to endothelium via VCAM-1 and P-selectin upregulation, triggering local inflammation and intimal proliferation. Repeated cycles of vaso-occlusion deplete ATP and deplete nitric oxide, reducing vasodilatory reserve. Upregulation of endothelin-1 further promotes vasoconstriction. Chronic hemolysis releases free hemoglobin, consuming nitric oxide and increasing oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species. Over time, concentric intimal hyperplasia in the MCA and ACA increases flow velocity, as luminal diameter shrinks by an estimated 30\u201350%. Compensatory collateral recruitment via leptomeningeal vessels may transiently preserve perfusion, but repetitive ischemia breaches autoregulatory capacity within hours, leading to infarction. Genetic modifiers such as \u03b1-thalassemia trait may ameliorate hemolysis and reduce stroke incidence by up to 40%.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in sickle cell stroke often occurs abruptly over minutes to hours, with peak deficits by 24 hours. Common presentations include focal weakness (usually hemiparesis in upper limb > lower limb), facial droop, and expressive or receptive aphasia depending on MCA territory involvement. Neurological exam reveals contralateral brisk reflexes, upgoing plantar response, and possible visual field deficits in PCA watershed zones. In children, peak incidence is 2\u20135 years of age, whereas adults have cumulative risk by the third decade. Gender differences are minimal. Systemic signs include acute chest syndrome or vaso-occlusive pain crisis preceding stroke in 20% of cases. Severity is graded by the Pediatric NIH Stroke Scale (PedNIHSS), with scores \u226510 predicting poor outcome. Without intervention, 70% of children with abnormal TCD develop infarcts within 3 years.

They are characterized by an abnormal connection between the dural arteries and the spinal venous system. The symptoms of DAVF typically progress gradually, leading to myelopathy, which includes symptoms such as leg weakness, sensory disturbances, and sphincter dysfunction that develop over months to years. Notably, the MRI findings of DAVF are distinctive, often showing flow-voids on the dorsal surface of the spinal cord due to the presence of abnormal veins and T2 hyperintensity caused by venous congestion.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding spinal vascular malformations requires a grasp of the basic anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord's vascular supply. The spinal cord receives its blood supply mainly from the anterior spinal artery and paired posterior spinal arteries, which arise from the vertebral arteries. The venous drainage occurs through a network of veins that eventually drain into the epidural venous plexus.\n\nDAVFs arise when there is an abnormal communication between the arterial and venous systems, bypassing the capillary bed. This abnormal connection leads to increased arterial pressure in the venous system, resulting in venous congestion and subsequent spinal cord compression.\n\nThe key distinction between DAVFs and other vascular malformations lies in their pathogenesis and clinical presentation. Understanding these differences is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiology of DAVFs involves the formation of abnormal arteriovenous connections within the dura mater, typically in the lumbosacral region. These fistulas can develop due to various factors, including trauma, degenerative changes, or idiopathic causes. The abnormal connection leads to elevated venous pressure, which causes engorgement of the draining veins and subsequent venous hypertension.\n\nAs the venous pressure rises, it compromises the microcirculation of the spinal cord, leading to ischemia and edema. This can manifest as T2 hyperintensity on MRI scans. The venous congestion may also lead to the development of collateral circulation, which can further complicate the clinical scenario by masking the underlying pathology.\n\nIn contrast, cavernomas consist of abnormal vascular channels filled with blood and are lined by a single layer of endothelial cells, lacking a normal vascular structure. AVMs, on the other hand, are characterized by a direct connection between arteries and veins, leading to a high flow state that can result in hemorrhagic events.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nPatients with DAVFs typically present with a constellation of symptoms that reflect progressive myelopathy. The clinical manifestations can include:\n\n- Motor Symptoms: Patients may experience weakness in the lower limbs, often starting asymmetrically. This weakness usually progresses over months to years and can lead to gait disturbances.\n  \n- Sensory Symptoms: Patients often report changes in sensation, such as numbness or tingling, typically in a \"saddle\" distribution or in the lower extremities. This sensory disturbance can include proprioceptive deficits.\n  \n- Sphincter Dysfunction: One of the hallmark features of DAVF is the development of urinary urgency, incontinence, or constipation due to involvement of the neural pathways controlling sphincter function.\n  \n- Pain: Some patients may experience back pain or radicular pain, although this is less common than the other symptoms.\n\nThe gradual onset of these symptoms is a key feature that differentiates DAVF from other spinal pathologies.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnosis of a spinal DAVF typically involves a combination of clinical assessment, imaging studies, and sometimes invasive procedures:\n\n- MRI of the Spine: This is the first-line imaging modality. Classic MRI findings include flow-voids on the dorsal surface of the spinal cord, indicating the presence of engorged veins, and T2-weighted hyperintensity of the spinal cord due to edema and venous congestion.\n  \n- CT Angiography (CTA): This imaging can help visualize the vascular anatomy and identify the feeding arteries to the fistula.\n  \n- Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA): This is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. DSA allows for direct visualization of the fistula and its vascular supply, enabling both diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.\n  \n- Differential Diagnosis: It is essential to differentiate DAVF from other conditions such as spinal tumors, multiple sclerosis, and other vascular malformations like AVMs and cavernomas.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nThe management of spinal DAVFs primarily involves intervention to occlude the fistula and restore normal venous drainage. Treatment options include:\n\n- Endovascular Embolization: This is often the first-line treatment for DAVFs. A catheter is navigated through the blood vessels to the site of the fistula, where embolic agents are used to occlude the abnormal connection.\n\n- Surgical Intervention: In cases where endovascular treatment is not feasible or has failed, surgical resection of the fistula may be necessary.\n\n- Medical Management: Symptomatic treatment may include pain management and rehabilitation to address motor and sensory deficits.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nPost-treatment follow-up for patients with DAVFs is crucial to monitor for recurrence and assess functional recovery. Guidelines typically recommend:\n\n- Regular Clinical Assessments: Evaluating neurological status and functional outcomes should be conducted at regular intervals, typically every 3-6 months post-intervention.\n\n- Repeat Imaging: MRI or MRA may be utilized to assess for any recurrence of the fistula or to monitor for post-treatment changes in the spinal cord.\n\n- Prognosis: The prognosis varies, with many patients experiencing significant improvement in symptoms following successful treatment. However, some may have residual deficits depending on the extent of prior damage to the spinal cord.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Key Symptoms: Remember the classic triad of leg weakness, sensory changes, and sphincter dysfunction as indicative of DAVF.\n  \n- MRI Findings: Focus on identifying flow-voids and T2 hyperintensity on MRI, which are hallmark signs of venous engorgement.\n  \n- Interventional Approach: Understand the importance of endovascular techniques in the management of DAVFs, as they are less invasive and often more effective than surgical options.\n\n- Differential Diagnosis: Always consider other vascular malformations and conditions that can mimic DAVF symptoms, such as AVMs and tumors, particularly when acute presentations occur.\n\n## 9.

Patients typically develop slowly worsening leg weakness, sensory disturbance, and sphincter dysfunction over months to years. On MRI of the spine, flow-voids on the dorsal surface of the cord and T2 hyperintensity due to venous congestion are classic findings. In contrast, cavernomas are intramedullary lesions that present more acutely or subacutely with hemorrhage and focal deficits, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the spinal cord are much rarer and often present with acute hemorrhage rather than the insidious course of DAVF. DAVFs account for up to 70% of spinal vascular malformations, whereas true spinal AVMs and cavernomas are each under 20%. Therefore, the scenario of progressive symptoms and characteristic MRI findings most strongly suggests DAVF.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:28:15.699611","word_count":3449,"source_file":"Part 2 2020 copy_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","import_source":"vascular_neurology_stroke_mcqs.json"}]
