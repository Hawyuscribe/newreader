Indomethacin. Indomethacin is the gold\u2010standard therapy for paroxysmal hemicrania, a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia characterized by multiple brief unilateral attacks with ipsilateral autonomic features. Primary literature (Sjaastad et al., 1984; Pareja et al., 2002) demonstrated a >90% complete response rate to indomethacin at doses of 75\u2013150 mg/day. No other class of medication achieves this diagnostic\u2010therapeutic response. There are no alternative agents with level A evidence for this condition, and nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs other than indomethacin fail to abort attacks reliably. Common misconceptions include using sumatriptan or high\u2010flow oxygen (effective in cluster headache, not paroxysmal hemicrania) or corticosteroids (which may help but lack the diagnostic clarity of indomethacin).","conceptual_foundation":"Paroxysmal hemicrania is classified under Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgias (TACs) in ICHD-3. It is distinguished from cluster headache by shorter attack duration (5\u201330 minutes), higher frequency (\u22655/day), and complete indomethacin responsiveness. Differential diagnoses include SUNCT/SUNA and hemicrania continua. Embryologically, trigeminal nociceptive pathways derive from neural crest cells; the autonomic component involves parasympathetic outflow via the facial nerve. Neuroanatomically, the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, superior salivatory nucleus, and posterior hypothalamus form the TAC pain matrix. Molecularly, prostaglandin synthesis via COX-1/COX-2 is inhibited by indomethacin, reducing nociceptor sensitization.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: trigeminal afferents relay noxious stimuli from cranial blood vessels. In paroxysmal hemicrania, hypothalamic dysregulation leads to activation of trigeminal autonomic reflex, causing release of CGRP and VIP, producing pain and autonomic features. Indomethacin inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin E2 and attenuating peripheral and central sensitization. This differentiates it from other TACs; for example, cluster headache involves more prominent hypothalamic activation and is less prostaglandin-driven.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients experience strictly unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain, 5\u201330 minutes per attack, up to 40 attacks/day. Ipsilateral autonomic signs include conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, eyelid edema. Attacks occur daily without significant pain\u2010free periods.

Lamotrigine is the most widely recommended first-line medical therapy for typical SUNCT (Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform headache attacks with Conjunctival injection and Tearing) based on multiple small case series and expert consensus. In a retrospective series of 30 SUNCT patients (Lambru et al. 2016), lamotrigine achieved \u226550% reduction in attack frequency in 74% of cases (Level C evidence, AHS guidelines 2019). There are no randomized controlled trials for SUNCT given its rarity, so guidance is extrapolated from case series and open-label studies. No other agent has comparable consistent efficacy. Lamotrigine\u2019s sodium-channel\u2013blocking properties modulate trigeminal nociceptive transmission, reducing attack frequency and intensity. Because no other options were provided, lamotrigine remains the standard recommendation.","conceptual_foundation":"SUNCT is classified under trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3). TACs share activation of the trigeminal autonomic reflex with ipsilateral cranial autonomic features. SUNCT is characterized by short (<10 sec) unilateral stabbing attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing, occurring up to hundreds of times per day. Differential includes SUNA (without tearing or conjunctival injection), cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua, and primary stabbing headache. Embryologically, trigeminal nerve fibers derive from the first branchial arch, converging on the trigeminal nucleus caudalis with connections to the superior salivatory nucleus explaining autonomic cranial features. There is no known genetic mutation uniquely associated with SUNCT; familial cases are exceedingly rare. Lesional causes (e.g., pituitary tumors) must be excluded with MRI of the brain and sella.","pathophysiology":"Normal trigeminal nociceptive transmission involves first-order neurons in the trigeminal ganglion projecting to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, relaying via second-order neurons to the thalamus. In SUNCT, abnormal hyperexcitability of second-order nociceptive neurons and disinhibition of the trigeminal autonomic reflex lead to brief, severe stabbing pain with autonomic activation. Lamotrigine stabilizes voltage-gated sodium channels, reducing repetitive neuronal firing in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (DeVries et al. 2017). Functional imaging studies show activation of ipsilateral posterior hypothalamus during attacks, similar to cluster headache but with more transient spikes in activity. This supports a central generator with paroxysmal discharges triggering pain and autonomic features.","clinical_manifestation":"SUNCT presents with unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal stabbing pain lasting 1\u2013600 seconds, accompanied by conjunctival injection and tearing in every attack. Attack frequency ranges from 10 to >200 per day. Patients often remain active between attacks. There is a male predominance (~2:1), age of onset typically 40\u201370 years. There are no aura or premonitory symptoms. Imaging of the brain including pituitary MRI is mandatory to exclude secondary SUNCT. In untreated cases, burden is high due to attack frequency; attacks may cluster over weeks to months with remissions lasting days to weeks.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on ICHD-3 criteria: \u226520 attacks fulfilling (a) pain lasting 1\u2013600 seconds, (b) unilateral orbital/temporal pain, (c) ipsilateral conjunctival injection and tearing, (d) frequency \u22651 per day, (e) not attributable to another disorder. First-tier evaluation includes detailed headache history and neurological exam, followed by MRI brain with pituitary protocol to rule out secondary causes (Grade C, AHS 2019). No laboratory biomarkers or electrophysiological tests are validated. Differential diagnosis includes SUNA, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania (indomethacin-responsive), and primary stabbing headache.","management_principles":"Lamotrigine is initiated at 25 mg daily, titrated by 25 mg every 2 weeks to a target of 100\u2013200 mg/day as tolerated (AHS consensus, 2019). In open-label series, 50% responder rate is ~70\u201375%. Common adverse effects include dizziness, rash; serious Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome occurs in <0.1%. Slow titration minimizes risk. If lamotrigine fails or is not tolerated, second-line options include topiramate (25\u2013100 mg/day) or gabapentin (900\u20132,400 mg/day) with lower and less consistent efficacy (40\u201350% responder rates). Indomethacin is ineffective in SUNCT, distinguishing it from paroxysmal hemicrania.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients on lamotrigine require follow-up every 4\u20136 weeks during titration to monitor efficacy and adverse effects. Baseline CBC and liver function tests are recommended prior to initiation, then every 3\u20136 months. Patient diaries should track attack frequency, duration, intensity, and side effects. Once stable on effective dose, follow-up every 6\u201312 months is reasonable. If remission occurs, taper lamotrigine gradually over months to assess relapse risk. Imaging is not repeated unless new clinical features arise.","clinical_pearls":"1. SUNCT responds best to lamotrigine; indomethacin-responsive headaches suggest paroxysmal hemicrania, not SUNCT. 2. Always obtain pituitary MRI in SUNCT to exclude adenoma\u2013associated SUNCT. 3.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Occipital seizures","Migraine"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Migraine","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. Migraine with aura commonly presents in children and adolescents with transient visual phenomena preceding headache. The red circular colors described are characteristic of a visual aura, often manifesting as scintillating scotomas or fortification spectra, which last 5\u201360 minutes and are followed by a unilateral, throbbing headache. Occipital seizures (option A) can produce brief visual hallucinations but are usually stereotyped, shorter (<2 minutes), and often followed by postictal confusion rather than a prolonged headache. Multiple studies, including population-based pediatric headache surveys, report that over 90% of children with migraine aura describe colored shapes or zigzag lines preceding pain, whereas occipital lobe epilepsy accounts for less than 1% of pediatric headache referrals and typically features EEG correlates absent in migraine. Thus, option B is supported by clinical prevalence, temporal characteristics, and typical phenomenology.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is classified as a primary headache disorder under ICHD-3. Pediatric migraine shares the same pathophysiological foundations as adult migraine but often presents bilaterally and with shorter duration. The visual aura arises from cortical spreading depression (CSD), a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization moving across the occipital cortex at 3\u20135 mm/min. Differential diagnoses include occipital seizures, transient ischemic attacks, and visual snow syndrome. In pediatric populations, migraine must be distinguished from benign childhood occipital epilepsy (Panayiotopoulos syndrome), which can also feature visual phenomena but less commonly presents with headache. Embryologically, the occipital lobe develops from the dorsal telencephalon; vascular supply is via the posterior cerebral artery, correlating with cortical susceptibility to CSD. Genetic factors include mutations in CACNA1A and ATP1A2 in familial hemiplegic migraine. Neurotransmitter systems involve glutamate, GABA, serotonin, and CGRP, which modulate neuronal excitability and vascular tone.","pathophysiology":"Normal visual processing in V1 allows perception of simple shapes and colors. In migraine aura, CSD initiates in occipital cortex, causing transient hyperemia followed by oligemia lasting up to an hour. This wave depolarizes neurons, releases glutamate, and activates trigeminovascular pathways. Neuropeptides like CGRP and substance P induce meningeal vasodilation and sterile neurogenic inflammation, leading to headache. Genetic channelopathies (e.g., CACNA1A) increase neuronal excitability, lowering CSD threshold. In contrast, occipital seizures involve paroxysmal hypersynchronous neuronal discharges localized to occipital cortex, lasting seconds, without the prolonged vascular and inflammatory changes seen in migraine. Seizures show ultrabrief extracellular potassium shifts and ictal EEG spikes, whereas CSD shows spreading depression on electrocorticography rather than epileptiform discharges.","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine with aura in children typically presents with bilateral or frontal headaches of moderate to severe intensity, associated with photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea. Visual aura occurs in about 25% of pediatric cases, with colored shapes, shimmering lights, or zebra stripes lasting 5\u201330 minutes. Prodromal symptoms may include mood changes and fatigue. Natural history: migraine frequency peaks in adolescence and often improves by early adulthood. Diagnostic criteria per ICHD-3 require at least two attacks with fully reversible aura symptoms, at least one aura symptom developing gradually over \u22655 minutes, and headache fulfilling migraine criteria. Sensitivity of ICHD-3 criteria in pediatric migraine is approximately 85%, specificity 90%.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical. First-tier evaluation includes detailed history focusing on aura characteristics, headache features, and family history. Neurological examination is typically normal interictally. Routine neuroimaging is not indicated in typical migraine with aura (AAN Level A recommendation) unless red flags (e.g., persistent aura >60 minutes, focal deficits) are present. If seizure is suspected, EEG with occipital leads may detect epileptiform discharges. Pretest probability of migraine in this scenario exceeds 90%; post-test probability remains high if red flags absent. Neuroimaging yield in typical pediatric migraine is <1% for significant pathology.","management_principles":"Acute treatment includes age-appropriate dosing of NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen 10 mg/kg) and acetaminophen. Triptans (e.g., rizatriptan 5\u201310 mg) are FDA-approved for children \u22656 years with demonstrated efficacy (NNT ~4 for pain relief at 2 hours). Antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) may be added for nausea. Preventive therapy is indicated if >4 attacks/month or significant disability; options include propranolol (1\u20133 mg/kg/day), topiramate (1\u20133 mg/kg/day), and amitriptyline (1\u20132 mg/kg/day), with NNTs ranging from 2.5 to 5. Contraindications: propranolol in asthma, topiramate with cognitive side effects. Non-pharmacological: sleep hygiene, hydration, biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3\u20136 months to assess attack frequency, treatment response, and side effects. Maintain headache diary. Laboratory monitoring for topiramate includes renal stones risk and metabolic acidosis; propranolol requires heart rate and blood pressure checks every 6 months. Transition of care to adult neurology around age 18. Prognostic factors: family history of migraine predicts persistence; early onset and high attack frequency predict chronicity. Rehabilitation not typically required.","clinical_pearls":"1.

The superior cerebellar artery (SCA) is the most frequent offending vessel in classical trigeminal neuralgia, responsible for pulsatile compression at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve in approximately 70\u201380% of microvascular decompression specimens. No other options were provided for comparison.","conceptual_foundation":"Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is characterized by sudden, severe, electric shock\u2013like facial pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. In the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3), classical TN is attributed to neurovascular compression leading to focal demyelination. The trigeminal nerve arises from the pons and exits at the root entry zone, which is especially vulnerable to vascular pulsations. Neuroanatomically, the SCA loops near this entry zone more commonly than other vessels, explaining its predominant role in TN.","pathophysiology":"Normal trigeminal transmission relies on myelinated A\u03b2 fibers for touch and A\u03b4/C fibers for nociception. Chronic pulsatile compression by the SCA induces focal demyelination at the root entry zone, leading to aberrant ephaptic transmission and hyperexcitability of primary afferents. This demyelination permits cross-talk between adjacent fibers, resulting in paroxysmal pain. Over time, maladaptive changes in sodium channel expression (upregulation of Nav1.3) further lower activation thresholds, perpetuating attack recurrence.","clinical_manifestation":"Classical TN presents with unilateral, lancinating facial pain lasting seconds to two minutes, often triggered by light touch, chewing, or speaking. The SCA-related compression most commonly affects the second (maxillary) or third (mandibular) divisions.
