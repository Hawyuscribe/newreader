[{"question_number":"2","question":"What is the most common gene associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD)?","options":["APOE","APP","Presenilin"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Presenilin","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C. Presenilin. Mutations in the presenilin-1 gene (PSEN1) account for approximately 70% of autosomal dominant early-onset familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), making presenilin the most common genetic cause. PSEN1 mutations alter \u03b3-secretase activity, increasing the A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio and driving amyloid plaque formation (Sherrington et al. Nature 1995;375:754-760). Option B, APP, encodes amyloid precursor protein; APP mutations underlie about 10\u201315% of familial early-onset AD cases but are less frequent than PSEN1 mutations (Goate et al. Nature 1991;349:704-706). Option A, APOE, is a strong risk factor for late-onset sporadic AD (especially the \u03b54 allele) but does not cause autosomal dominant familial AD (Corder et al. Science 1993;261:921-923). Common misconceptions arise from conflating APOE \u03b54\u2019s risk contribution with direct causation; unlike presenilin mutations, APOE \u03b54 increases risk but is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause familial early-onset AD.","conceptual_foundation":"Familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease is defined by an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and onset typically before age 65. The principal causative genes are APP (chromosome 21), PSEN1 (chromosome 14), and PSEN2 (chromosome 1). In ICD-11, early-onset familial AD falls under 8A00.0; in DSM-5-TR, it meets criteria for Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, early onset. Historically, APP mutations were first described in 1991 (Goate et al.), followed by presenilin discoveries in 1995 (Sherrington et al., Levy-Lahad et al.). Embryologically, APP processing and \u03b3-secretase assembly occur during neuronal differentiation. PSEN1 is expressed ubiquitously in CNS neurons; its protein localizes to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, integral to the \u03b3-secretase complex alongside nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2. Genetic taxonomy has evolved from chromosomal linkage to next-generation sequencing panels; PSEN1 remains the most frequently mutated gene in familial early-onset AD cohorts worldwide.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, \u03b3-secretase cleaves APP to produce A\u03b2 peptides, predominantly A\u03b240. PSEN1 encodes the catalytic core of \u03b3-secretase. Pathogenic PSEN1 mutations shift cleavage specificity, elevating the relative production of the more aggregation-prone A\u03b242 peptide. Elevated A\u03b242 seeds oligomerization and plaque formation, triggering a cascade of synaptic dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. On a molecular level, mutant presenilin perturbs Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis, compounding neurodegenerative processes. Chronic activation of microglia and astrocytes by A\u03b2 oligomers leads to cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and complement activation, driving synapse elimination. Regionally, highest plaque burden occurs in hippocampus and association cortices supplied by posterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries. PSEN1 mutation carriers exhibit earlier onset and more aggressive progression compared to APP or PSEN2 mutations.","clinical_manifestation":"PSEN1-related familial AD typically presents in the mid-40s to early 50s with insidious short-term memory decline, progressing over 5\u201310 years. Early executive dysfunction and visuospatial deficits are common; language impairment emerges later. In ~10\u201315% of cases, atypical features such as spastic paraparesis, myoclonus, or seizures appear early due to widespread cortical involvement. Behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms (apathy, depression, agitation) occur in up to 80% of patients. Variant phenotypes include posterior cortical atrophy and primary progressive aphasia in rare families. Untreated, PSEN1 mutation carriers progress to severe dementia, dependence, and death typically within 10 years of symptom onset. Formal diagnostic criteria per NIA-AA (2011) require insidious onset, clear history of worsening cognition, and objective impairment in memory and at least one other domain.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with comprehensive history including age at onset and pedigree analysis. First-tier investigations include MRI to exclude structural mimics (variants of frontotemporal dementia, vascular changes) and routine labs (TSH, B12, HIV). Neuropsychological testing (MMSE, MoCA, ADAS-Cog) quantifies deficits. Genetic testing is indicated for individuals with onset before 65 and a positive family history: targeted panels for PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP. PSEN1 yields a diagnostic sensitivity of ~70% in familial early-onset AD (Bateman et al. JAMA Neurol 2019;76:1-10). CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242, total tau, phospho-tau) support AD pathology with >85% sensitivity and specificity. Amyloid PET imaging may confirm amyloid deposition but is second-tier due to cost and radiation exposure.","management_principles":"No therapies modify disease course in familial AD. Symptomatic treatment follows AAN guidelines: cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine; Level A recommendation) to improve cognition modestly (NNT \u2248 12 for clinically meaningful response), and memantine for moderate-to-severe dementia (Level B). Off-label use of combination therapy may yield incremental benefits. Emerging anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (e.g., aducanumab) target aggregated A\u03b2; phase III trials show reduction in amyloid PET signal but clinical efficacy remains controversial (Biogen EMERGE/ENGAGE data). Non-pharmacological interventions include cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, and caregiver support. All patients and at-risk relatives should receive genetic counseling discussing inheritance, testing implications, and family planning.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 6\u201312 months to monitor cognitive trajectory using standardized scales (MMSE, ADAS-Cog), functional status (FAQ), and behavioral symptoms (NPI). Laboratory monitoring is limited but includes evaluation of adverse effects from cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., GI symptoms, bradycardia). Imaging follow-up is not routinely indicated unless new focal findings emerge. Multidisciplinary care involves neurology, psychiatry, neuropsychology, social work, and palliative care. Prognostic factors include age at onset, baseline cognitive score, and specific PSEN1 mutation type. Early involvement of genetic counseling for at-risk family members, with discussion of predictive testing protocols, confidentiality, and psychosocial support, is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1.

APP mutations produce an elevated A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio but are less common (~10\u201315%); consider in Down syndrome screening. 3. APOE \u03b54 increases risk for late-onset AD but is not a causative gene in familial early-onset cases. 4. Genetic testing panels for PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP yield a ~85% detection rate in appropriately selected families. 5. Management remains symptomatic\u2014no disease-modifying therapy is approved for familial AD despite promising anti-amyloid trials.","references":"1. Goate A, Chartier-Harlin MC, Mullan M, et al.

Key supportive features are visual hallucinations (seeing small animals), fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness, and parkinsonism (often subtle). According to the 2017 McKeith consensus criteria, visual hallucinations occur in over 80% of DLB patients, and cognitive fluctuations are seen in approximately 70%. Option B (Mild cognitive impairment) is incorrect because MCI does not include frank dementia or prominent visual hallucinations. Option C (Alzheimer\u2019s disease) typically presents with early memory impairment and later progresses to visual-spatial deficits; hallucinations and pronounced fluctuations are uncommon early. Option D (Schizophrenia) is incorrect given the late onset at age 77, absence of a lifelong history of psychosis, and presence of progressive cognitive decline over years.","conceptual_foundation":"Dementia with Lewy bodies is classified under neurodegenerative disorders in ICD-11 (code 8A63). It overlaps clinically with Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia but is distinguished by early cognitive symptoms. Neuropathologically, DLB is characterized by cortical alpha-synuclein Lewy bodies. The nosological evolution began with the 1996 DLB Consortium criteria, refined in 2005 and 2017 to emphasize core clinical features (visual hallucinations, fluctuations, parkinsonism) and indicative biomarkers. Differential diagnoses include Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia, and psychiatric disorders.","pathophysiology":"Normal cholinergic and dopaminergic systems maintain cognitive and sensorimotor integration. In DLB, misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates form Lewy bodies within cortical and subcortical neurons, disrupting synaptic transmission. Loss of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert leads to visual hallucinations and attention deficits, while dopaminergic deficits in the substantia nigra pars compacta contribute to parkinsonism. Neuroinflammatory cascades and mitochondrial dysfunction further propagate neuronal injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in their seventies with cognitive impairment affecting attention, executive function, and visuospatial abilities. Core features include well-formed visual hallucinations in 80% of cases, cognitive fluctuations in 60\u201370%, and parkinsonian signs (rigidity, bradykinesia) in 50\u201360%. REM sleep behavior disorder precedes cognitive decline in up to 70%. Unlike Alzheimer\u2019s disease, short-term memory is relatively preserved early on.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes detailed history for fluctuations and hallucinations, neurological exam for parkinsonism, and cognitive testing (e.g., MoCA). MRI is used to exclude structural lesions. DaTscan (dopamine transporter SPECT) has sensitivity ~78% and specificity ~90% for differentiating DLB from AD (AAN 2018). Polysomnography confirms REM sleep behavior disorder. Biomarkers such as reduced occipital perfusion on FDG-PET support the diagnosis.","management_principles":"Non-pharmacologic measures include environmental modifications and sleep hygiene. Rivastigmine (3\u201312 mg/day) is first-line for cognitive symptoms, improving attention and hallucinations (Class I, Level A). Levodopa may relieve parkinsonism but can worsen psychosis; start at low doses. Avoid typical antipsychotics; quetiapine or clozapine may be used cautiously for severe behavioral symptoms (Level C). Melatonin (3\u20136 mg nightly) is recommended for REM sleep behavior disorder (Level B).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3\u20136 months with cognitive and motor assessments. Monitor cholinesterase inhibitor tolerance (GI side effects, bradycardia). Annual screening for orthostatic hypotension and fall risk. Reassess sleep behavior disorder symptoms and adjust melatonin or clonazepam. Engage caregivers in education and support, and refer to specialist dementia services as needed.","clinical_pearls":"1. Visual hallucinations and fluctuations are core to DLB\u2014distinguishing features from Alzheimer\u2019s. 2. Use DaTscan to differentiate DLB from AD when diagnosis is uncertain. 3. Rivastigmine improves both cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB. 4. Avoid neuroleptics like haloperidol due to risk of severe sensitivity reactions. 5. REM sleep behavior disorder often precedes other features and can be an early marker.","references":"1. McKeith IG et al.

Presenilin 1. Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) encodes the catalytic subunit of the \u03b3-secretase complex responsible for cleaving amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides. Mutations in PSEN1 are the most common cause of autosomal dominant early\u2010onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD), accounting for approximately 50\u201370% of familial EOAD cases (Sherrington et al. 1995; Ryman et al. 2014). These mutations alter \u03b3-secretase site specificity, increasing the A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio and promoting neurotoxic oligomer formation. Option B (APP) is also associated with familial EOAD\u2014APP missense mutations or duplications on chromosome 21 cause EOAD in roughly 10\u201315% of families\u2014but are less frequent than PSEN1 mutations. Option D (Presenilin 2) likewise causes EOAD in about 5\u201310% of families but exhibits lower penetrance and later average onset compared to PSEN1. Option A (APOE) encodes apolipoprotein E; the \u03b54 allele is a major risk factor for late\u2010onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) but is neither causative for monogenic EOAD nor sufficient to produce disease on its own. Common misconceptions include overestimating the role of APOE \u03b54 in early\u2010onset familial forms and equating APP-related Down syndrome AD with PSEN1\u2010driven familial EOAD. Current NIA-AA guidelines (2011, 2018) recommend genetic testing for PSEN1 in patients with cognitive decline before age 65 and a positive family history, given the high predictive value and implications for family counseling.","conceptual_foundation":"Early\u2010onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) is defined by symptom onset before age 65 and often follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern when caused by APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 mutations. In ICD-11, Alzheimer disease is coded as 6D83, with EOAD specified under subcategories indicating age of onset and genetic etiology. The National Institute on Aging\u2013Alzheimer\u2019s Association (NIA-AA) research framework classifies Alzheimer disease biologically by pathologic hallmarks\u2014A\u03b2 deposition and tauopathy\u2014regardless of clinical phenotype (Jack et al. 2018). Familial EOAD must be differentiated from sporadic LOAD, frontotemporal dementia, prion diseases, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory/infectious etiologies, which can mimic early cognitive decline. Historically, Goate et al. (1991) first identified APP missense mutations in familial EOAD, followed by Sherrington et al. (1995) cloning PSEN1 and Levy-Lahad et al. (1995) identifying PSEN2. Embryologically, regions most vulnerable to AD pathology\u2014hippocampus and entorhinal cortex\u2014derive from the pallial telencephalon, with layer II neurons migrating under reelin guidance. Neuroanatomical involvement begins in medial temporal lobe structures, spreading to association cortices, reflecting neuronal network connectivity. Molecularly, APP is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein; \u03b3-secretase complex subunits (PSEN1/2, nicastrin, APH-1, PEN-2) mediate intramembranous cleavage. Mutations in PSEN1 alter catalytic aspartate residues, shifting cleavage from A\u03b240 (nonpathogenic) toward A\u03b242 (aggregation\u2010prone). APOE, on chromosome 19, modulates A\u03b2 clearance and aggregation but does not directly change secretase activity. Differential gene penetrance, allele frequency, and age\u2010dependent expression patterns underpin the distinct clinical courses of EOAD subtypes.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology involves sequential APP processing by \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) generating C99 fragment, then \u03b3-secretase\u2010mediated intramembrane cleavage yielding A\u03b2 peptides, predominantly A\u03b240 and smaller quantities of A\u03b242. PSEN1 provides the active site of \u03b3-secretase; mutations modify the enzyme\u2019s conformation, increasing production of the more hydrophobic A\u03b242. Elevated A\u03b242 oligomerizes, disrupting synaptic transmission by interfering with NMDA receptor\u2013mediated long\u2010term potentiation and inducing dendritic spine loss. A\u03b2 accumulation triggers tau hyperphosphorylation via GSK-3\u03b2 and CDK5 kinases, leading to neurofibrillary tangle formation that impairs axonal transport. Neuronal injury then stimulates microglial activation through TLR4 and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways, releasing IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, further damaging synapses. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and calcium dyshomeostasis exacerbate neuronal loss. In PSEN1 EOAD, these processes progress more rapidly, with brain volumetric studies showing 2.5\u20134% annual hippocampal atrophy versus ~1% in normal aging. APP mutations near \u03b2-secretase sites elevate total A\u03b2, but PSEN1 mutations uniquely adjust the A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. PSEN2 dysfunction mirrors PSEN1 but with lower enzymatic impact and later onset. APOE \u03b54 influences lipidation of A\u03b2 and clearance across the blood\u2013brain barrier rather than secretase activity. These mechanistic distinctions account for the earlier age at onset and more aggressive progression in PSEN1\u2010driven disease.","clinical_manifestation":"PSEN1\u2010related EOAD typically presents between ages 30 and 60 (mean ~45 years). Amnestic deficits predominate in over 85% of cases, with progressive impairment of episodic memory and spatial orientation. Executive dysfunction appears in 60\u201370%, manifesting as impaired planning and multitasking. Visuospatial deficits occur in 30\u201340%, while language disturbances (anomia, word\u2010finding difficulty) affect 20\u201330%. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially depression and apathy, precede cognitive decline in up to 50%, complicating early diagnosis. Unlike sporadic LOAD, extrapyramidal signs are uncommon, though seizures and myoclonus may emerge in advanced stages. Familial clustering, autosomal dominant transmission with nearly complete penetrance by age 60, distinguishes PSEN1 EOAD. Disease duration averages 8\u201310 years from symptom onset to severe dementia, faster than in LOAD. Atypical variants\u2014logopenic primary progressive aphasia and posterior cortical atrophy\u2014occur in a minority. Natural history in untreated cases includes progressive loss of independence, language decline, and eventual motor and swallowing impairment. NIA-AA and IWG\u20102 diagnostic criteria require insidious onset, progressive decline, and biomarker confirmation (CSF A\u03b242 reduction, elevated tau). Sensitivity and specificity exceed 85% when combining clinical assessment with imaging and CSF biomarkers. Special populations\u2014such as individuals with Down syndrome\u2014experience similar pathology but distinct gene\u2010dosage effects due to APP triplication.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of suspected EOAD involves a tiered framework. First\u2010tier evaluation includes detailed family and medical history emphasizing onset before 65 and autosomal dominant patterns. Cognitive screening with MoCA or MMSE and comprehensive neuropsychological testing delineate domain\u2010specific deficits. Routine labs (thyroid, B12, RPR, HIV) exclude reversible causes. Second\u2010tier testing utilizes MRI to identify hippocampal and parietal atrophy (sensitivity 80\u201390%, specificity 75\u201385%) and FDG\u2010PET to demonstrate temporoparietal hypometabolism (sensitivity and specificity ~90%). CSF analysis of A\u03b242, total tau, and p-tau has combined sensitivity ~92% and specificity ~80%. Pre\u2010test probability for a PSEN1 mutation exceeds 70% in familial EOAD cohorts. Third\u2010tier genetic testing\u2014targeted sequencing of PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP\u2014yields pathogenic variant detection in >60% of familial cases, with analytic sensitivity >99%. Next\u2010generation panels streamline testing, but variants of uncertain significance require multidisciplinary review. AAN and NIA-AA guidelines recommend genetic testing only when results will inform prognostication, family planning, or clinical trial eligibility. Diagnostic pitfalls include misattribution to psychiatric etiologies in younger patients and overlapping atrophy patterns with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Pre\u2010 and post\u2010test counseling must address psychological impact, discrimination concerns, and cascade testing implications.","management_principles":"There is no cure for PSEN1 EOAD; management focuses on symptom control, supportive care, and trial enrollment. First\u2010line pharmacotherapy comprises acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine). Donepezil yields modest cognitive benefits (ADAS-cog improvement 2\u20134 points at 24 weeks; NNT ~12) and global stabilization (McShane et al. 2006). Rivastigmine and galantamine demonstrate similar efficacy. Memantine, an NMDA antagonist, is indicated in moderate to severe stages, offering cognitive and functional improvements (effect size 0.3\u20130.4). Combination therapy provides incremental benefits in activities of daily living. Second\u2010tier disease\u2010modifying approaches include anti\u2013A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab, lecanemab), which reduce plaque burden on PET but have variable clinical outcomes; aducanumab has FDA accelerated approval based on amyloid reduction. BACE1 inhibitors (verubecestat) have failed to show clinical efficacy and carry adverse effects. Nonpharmacological interventions\u2014cognitive rehabilitation, aerobic exercise, Mediterranean diet\u2014offer modest slowing of decline. Genetic counseling is vital, discussing inheritance risks and reproductive options including preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Multidisciplinary teams (neurology, psychiatry, neuropsychology, social work) ensure holistic care. Enrollment in observational and interventional trials is strongly encouraged.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up visits should occur every 3\u20136 months to monitor cognitive and functional status and adjust therapies. Standardized tools (MMSE, MoCA, ADAS-cog) quantify decline, with annual MMSE drop rates of 3\u20134 points. Functional assessments (CDR-SB, ADCS-ADL) guide care planning. Laboratory monitoring of cholinesterase inhibitors includes liver function tests and ECG every 6\u201312 months to detect bradycardia or QT changes. Routine imaging is not required unless atypical progression arises; repeat MRI every 12\u201324 months can document atrophy for trial participation. Behavioral symptoms demand close follow\u2010up, with antipsychotics reserved for severe agitation. Genetic counseling follow\u2010up addresses cascade testing for at-risk relatives and psychosocial support. Advance care planning, legal guardianship, and end-of-life directives should be discussed early. Prognostic factors include specific PSEN1 mutation type, age of onset, and comorbid vascular risk factors.

Korsakoff dementia, part of the Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome due to thiamine deficiency in chronic alcoholism, presents with a profound anterograde amnesia specifically affecting the ability to form new episodic memories. Immediate (sensory) memory and working memory supported by prefrontal cortex circuits remain relatively preserved, as does procedural memory mediated by basal ganglia and cerebellar pathways. Option B (Immediate memory) is incorrect because patients can hold information for seconds but cannot transfer it into long-term storage. Option C (Working memory) is incorrect as digit span and other working memory tasks are typically intact. Option D (Procedural memory) is preserved in Korsakoff dementia, allowing patients to learn new motor skills despite lacking conscious recollection.","conceptual_foundation":"Episodic memory refers to the conscious recollection of personal experiences with contextual details (where and when). In the nosological framework (ICD-11: 6D80.0 Korsakoff syndrome; DSM-5-TR: 292.85 Alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type), Korsakoff dementia is classified under substance-induced neurocognitive disorders with prominent memory impairment. Differential diagnoses include Alzheimer\u2019s disease (early semantic and episodic memory loss), semantic dementia (semantic memory loss), and transient global amnesia (acute, reversible episodic memory loss). Historically first described in 1887 by Sergei Korsakoff, this syndrome highlights the role of the medial diencephalon and hippocampal-fornix connections in episodic memory consolidation.","pathophysiology":"Normal episodic memory encoding and retrieval depend on the hippocampus, mammillary bodies, anterior and medial thalamic nuclei, and their interconnecting fornix fibers. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is critical for neuronal glucose metabolism via pyruvate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; deficiency leads to cytotoxic and vasogenic edema, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the mammillary bodies and medial dorsal thalamus. This selective vulnerability disrupts the Papez circuit, abolishing the transfer of information from short-term to long-term episodic storage. Procedural memory, by contrast, is mediated by corticostriatal loops that are less thiamine-sensitive, explaining their preservation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with Korsakoff dementia characteristically exhibit severe anterograde amnesia: they cannot learn new events or retain recent conversations. Retrograde amnesia often spans months to years prior to onset, displaying a temporal gradient (Ribot\u2019s law). Confabulation\u2014fabricated memories without intent to deceive\u2014occurs in 50\u201370% of cases. Executive functions (planning, abstract reasoning) may be mildly impaired secondary to diencephalic lesions, but visuospatial and procedural skills remain intact. Patients often appear alert and cooperative despite profound memory gaps.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on history of nutritional deficiency or alcoholism combined with irreversible memory deficits. Neuroimaging (MRI) may show T2/FLAIR hyperintensity or atrophy in mammillary bodies and medial thalamic regions (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%). Neuropsychological testing confirms disproportionate episodic memory loss with preserved working and procedural memory. Routine labs include thiamine level (often low), erythrocyte transketolase activity, and general nutritional panels to rule out alternative causes.","management_principles":"Immediate high-dose parenteral thiamine (500 mg IV three times daily for 2\u20133 days, then 250 mg daily) is recommended by the Royal College of Physicians (Grade B). Abstinence from alcohol, nutritional rehabilitation (multivitamins, high-protein diet), and cognitive rehabilitation strategies form the cornerstone of management. No pharmacologic agent reliably reverses established memory deficits, but cholinesterase inhibitors have been trialed without consistent benefit.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up focuses on monitoring nutritional status, abstinence from alcohol, and neuropsychological support. Thiamine supplementation should continue orally (100 mg daily) indefinitely. Periodic cognitive assessments (every 6\u201312 months) gauge stability or progression. Vigilance for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or peripheral neuropathy is essential in chronic alcohol users.","clinical_pearls":"1. In Korsakoff dementia, episodic memory is profoundly impaired while procedural and working memory remain intact; useful for distinguishing from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. 2. Confabulation arises from gaps in episodic recall, not deception. 3. MRI showing mammillary body atrophy strongly supports the diagnosis. 4. Prompt thiamine repletion can prevent progression but rarely reverses established damage. 5. Always assess for ocular signs (nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia) of Wernicke encephalopathy, the acute precursor.","references":"1. Kopelman MD. Korsakoff's syndrome.

Numerous studies demonstrate that FDG-PET patterns of regional cerebral hypometabolism reliably separate FTD from AD: FTD shows predominant hypometabolism in the frontal and anterior temporal cortices, whereas AD shows posterior cingulate and parietal hypometabolism (Rabinovici et al. Neurology 2011;76(1):50\u201356, sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%). By contrast, MRI can show atrophy patterns (frontal>temporal in FTD vs hippocampal/parietal in AD) but is less sensitive in early disease and less specific (Whitwell et al. Brain 2010;133(2):603\u2013617). Noncontrast CT provides even poorer resolution of cortical atrophy and no metabolic information. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (A\u03b242, total tau, phosphorylated tau) are helpful for AD versus normal aging but overlap substantially between FTD and AD, reducing specificity (Schoonenboom et al. Alzheimers Dement 2012;8(1):20\u201328). Thus FDG-PET is the single most useful neuroimaging tool to differentiate these two disorders.","conceptual_foundation":"Frontotemporal dementia encompasses a group of neurodegenerative syndromes characterized by progressive changes in behavior, personality, or language due to selective degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes (ICD-11: 6D83). Alzheimer\u2019s disease is defined by insidious onset of episodic memory impairment with progression to global cognitive decline associated with amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (ICD-11: 6D80). Historically FTD was subdivided into behavioral variant FTD and primary progressive aphasias; DSM-5-TR recognizes major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration and its variants. In contrast, AD is classified under major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Embryologically, frontal and temporal neocortex arise from telencephalic vesicles, whereas hippocampus develops from medial pallium; selective vulnerability in FTD targets neurons in the frontal\u2013temporal network, while AD preferentially affects hippocampal and parietal networks. Neurotransmitter systems implicated include serotonergic and dopaminergic deficits in FTD behavioral variant, and cholinergic deficits in AD. Vascular supply differs: anterior cerebral artery branches supply medial frontal lobes, middle cerebral artery branches supply lateral frontotemporal cortex, and posterior cerebral artery supplies posterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Molecular genetics: mutations in GRN, MAPT, C9orf72 underlie familial FTD; APOE \u03b54 increases AD risk. These concepts form the basis for understanding why imaging patterns differ by disease.","pathophysiology":"Normal glucose metabolism in the brain is supported by neuronal activity and synaptic transmission; FDG-PET measures regional uptake of labeled glucose analog. In FTD, degeneration of layer II/III pyramidal neurons in frontal and anterior temporal cortices leads to reduced glucose uptake in these regions. Underlying molecular mechanisms include accumulation of misfolded tau or TDP-43 proteins, triggering synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. AD pathophysiology involves extracellular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 peptides and intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles, starting in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, then spreading to parietal and frontal lobes. This pattern produces relative hypometabolism in posterior cingulate and parietal regions on FDG-PET. CSF biomarkers reflect these processes but overlap; MRI atrophy results from neuronal loss and gliosis but lags behind metabolic changes. Thus FDG-PET provides a direct in vivo measure of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal injury that closely parallels underlying pathology and yields distinct topographical signatures for FTD vs AD.","clinical_manifestation":"Behavioral variant FTD typically presents in the 50s\u201360s with disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, compulsive behaviors, and executive dysfunction. Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia manifests with impaired naming and word comprehension. In contrast, AD presents with insidious episodic memory loss, spatial disorientation, and later involvement of language and executive functions. Neuropsychological testing shows prominent executive impairment in FTD and dominant memory impairment in AD. Disease progression in FTD is more rapid (median survival ~6\u20138 years) compared to AD (median survival ~8\u201312 years). Clinical overlap can occur: FTD can have memory deficits, AD can have behavioral changes, making imaging especially valuable in early or atypical cases.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes history, neurological exam, basic labs, MRI to exclude secondary causes and assess atrophy patterns. If differentiation remains unclear or in early disease, second-tier testing with FDG-PET is recommended (AAN practice parameter 2018, Level B evidence). FDG-PET has sensitivity ~90% and specificity ~85% for FTD vs AD. CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242, tau) may be used adjunctively but overlap reduces specificity (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~70%). Amyloid PET can confirm AD pathology but does not directly identify FTD. CT brain is only indicated if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable.","management_principles":"There are no disease-modifying therapies for FTD. Management is symptomatic: SSRIs (e.g., sertraline 50\u2013100 mg daily) can reduce behavioral symptoms (Level C evidence), antipsychotics reserved for severe agitation. Speech therapy may help in aphasic variants. In AD, cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil 5\u201310 mg daily, rivastigmine patch 4.6\u20139.5 mg/d) and memantine (10\u201320 mg/d) are first-line (AAN Guidelines 2018, Class I evidence) to slow cognitive decline. Behavioral interventions and caregiver support are essential in both disorders. Clinical trials of targeted therapies (e.g., anti-tau for FTD, anti-amyloid for AD) are ongoing.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months with clinical assessment, cognitive testing (e.g., MMSE, MoCA), and functional evaluation. Repeat imaging is generally reserved for research or when clinical features change unexpectedly. Monitor for medication side effects, progression of behavioral or language symptoms, and caregiver burden. Advanced care planning should begin early in the disease course.","clinical_pearls":"- FDG-PET distinguishes FTD (frontal/anterior temporal hypometabolism) from AD (posterior cingulate/parietal hypometabolism) with >85% specificity.  \n- MRI atrophy patterns can suggest but not definitively differentiate FTD vs AD, especially early.  \n- CSF A\u03b242/tau ratios overlap between FTD and AD; low A\u03b242 and high tau are more specific for AD.  \n- Behavioral variant FTD often presents with disinhibition and loss of empathy, whereas AD presents with predominant memory impairment.  \n- Early referral for FDG-PET in atypical dementia cases can shorten time to accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.","references":["[1] Rabinovici GD, et al.
