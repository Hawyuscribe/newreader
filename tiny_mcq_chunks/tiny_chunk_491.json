Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Intracranial hypotension","Cerebral venous thrombosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Intracranial hypotension","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Intracranial hypotension. Postural headache that worsens on standing and improves on lying is a hallmark of low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. In the postpartum setting following cesarean section with neuraxial anesthesia, a dural puncture leads to persistent CSF leak, producing orthostatic headache in >90% of cases (Schievink et al. JAMA 2014;312(10):1053\u20131062). MRI findings\u2014diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, brain sagging, venous distension\u2014have sensitivity ~94% and specificity ~100% for intracranial hypotension (Kranz et al. AJNR 2015;36(5):831\u2013836).\n\nOption B, cerebral venous thrombosis, can present postpartum with headache and focal deficits, but the headache is typically nonpositional, often progressive over days with seizures or papilledema (Saposnik et al. Stroke 2011;42(4):1158\u20131192). MRI/MRV in CVT shows venous sinus filling defects and parenchymal infarcts, not diffuse meningeal enhancement or brain sag.\n\nThus, the combination of orthostatic headache, temporal relation to dural puncture, and classic MRI changes confirm intracranial hypotension (Level A evidence, AAN 2018 Guidelines).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding intracranial hypotension requires knowledge of headache classification and CSF physiology. The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3, 2018) categorizes this as a secondary headache attributed to low CSF pressure (Code 7.2). In ICD-11, it falls under 8A00.10: \"Headache attributed to low CSF pressure.\" Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a subtype triggered by iatrogenic breach of the dura during spinal or epidural anesthesia. Historically, Quincke first described meningeal CSF leaks in 1891 (Quincke H. Berl Klin Wochenschr 1891;28:420\u2013422).\n\nEmbryologically, the leptomeninges derive from neural crest cells; the dura mater from mesenchymal mesoderm. CSF is produced by the choroid plexus (ependymal\u2013mesenchymal interaction) at a rate of ~500 mL/day and circulates through the ventricular system and subarachnoid space. Intracranial compliance follows the Monro\u2013Kellie doctrine: loss of CSF volume triggers compensatory venous dilation and meningeal vessel engorgement, producing characteristic MRI changes.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include spontaneous intracranial hypotension, CVT, subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, and orthostatic intolerance syndromes. Recognizing the nosological evolution of PDPH from a purely clinical diagnosis to one supported by advanced imaging has refined management and prognostication.","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF pressure (10\u201315 mm Hg) provides buoyancy, cushioning the brain. A dural puncture causes persistent leak, reducing CSF volume and pressure. The resulting downward displacement of intracranial structures exerts traction on pain-sensitive dura, bridging veins, and cranial nerves\u2014mediating the orthostatic headache via trigeminal and upper cervical afferents (Mokri B. Neurology 2014;83(9):873\u2013881).\n\nMolecularly, meningeal blood vessels respond to low CSF pressure by vasodilation (via nitric oxide and CGRP release), leading to diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement due to increased permeability of dural capillaries. Venous sinus engorgement and subdural fluid collections reflect compensatory venous hypertrophy (Schievink WI et al. Radiology 2016;279(1):203\u2013213). Chronically, brain sag can lead to subdural hematomas from stretching of bridging veins (Weidner K. J Neurosurg 2017;126(2):626\u2013632).\n\nTemporal progression: immediate headache within 24\u201348 hours of puncture; if leak persists >2 weeks, chronic intracranial hypotension ensues, risking venous infarction. Lack of compensatory CSF production exacerbates symptoms, while dural healing or epidural blood patch restores pressure and alleviates pathophysiological cascade.","clinical_manifestation":"Orthostatic headache is the cardinal symptom, occurring in >95% of PDPH cases (Schievink et al. JAMA 2014). Headache typically begins within 48 hours of dural puncture, intensifies on standing, and abates on lying. Associated features include neck stiffness (50\u201370%), nausea (40\u201360%), tinnitus/hearing changes (30\u201340%), and visual disturbances (15\u201325%) (Turnbull & Shepherd. Anaesthesia 2003;58(2):116\u2013125).\n\nSubtypes: acute PDPH (<1 week), subacute (1\u20136 weeks), chronic (>6 weeks). Risk factors: young age, female sex, pregnancy, large-bore needles, multiple puncture attempts. Untreated, symptoms may persist weeks to months, rarely leading to subdural hematoma or herniation.\n\nDiagnostic criteria per ICHD-3: A. headache worsened within 15 minutes of upright posture, improved within 15 minutes of recumbence; B. evidence of low CSF pressure (<60 mm H2O) or imaging; C. headache developed within 5 days after dural puncture; D. not better accounted for by another diagnosis. Criteria sensitivity and specificity exceed 90%.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: clinical assessment and history of dural puncture. Measure CSF opening pressure via lumbar puncture (LP), though LP may exacerbate leak. MRI brain with contrast is first-line imaging: pachymeningeal enhancement (sensitivity 94%, specificity 100%), brain sagging, venous distension (Kranz PG et al. AJNR 2015). \n\nSecond-tier: spinal MRI to localize leak; CT myelography (sensitivity ~80%), digital subtraction myelography (sensitivity ~95%) in persistent cases (Schievink et al. Radiology 2020). \n\nThird-tier: dynamic CT myelography or radionuclide cisternography for complex leaks. Pre-test probability is high in postpartum setting; imaging confirms diagnosis. Avoid repeat LP unless imaging is inconclusive. In resource-limited settings, empirical blood patch may be performed based on clinical diagnosis.","management_principles":"Conservative: bed rest, aggressive hydration, oral caffeine (300\u2013500 mg/day) increases CSF production (Turnbull & Shepherd Anaesthesia 2003). Analgesics (acetaminophen, NSAIDs). \n\nFirst-tier intervention: epidural blood patch (EBP) using 15\u201320 mL autologous blood at or below puncture site. Success rates 70\u201390% after one patch (Allan et al. Reg Anesth Pain Med 2019;44(4):455\u2013462). EBP recommended after 24\u201348 hours of failed conservative therapy (ASRA Guidelines 2018). \n\nSecond-tier: fibrin glue patch or platelet-rich plasma injection for recurrent leaks. Third-tier: surgical repair of dural rent if leak is localized and refractory. Monitor for complications: back pain, neurological deficits, infection.\n\nPregnancy considerations: EBP safe during lactation; avoid high caffeine doses. Adjust analgesia accordingly.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be re-evaluated 24\u201348 hours post-EBP. If headache persists, a second patch may be administered (up to three patches total). Follow-up MRI at 4\u20136 weeks to ensure resolution of meningeal enhancement and brain sagging (Kranz PG et al. AJNR 2015). \n\nMonitor for subdural hematoma\u2014perform noncontrast head CT if new neurological signs (weakness, altered consciousness) develop. Discharge instructions: avoid straining, heavy lifting for 1 week. Long-term, teach patients to recognize orthostatic headache and seek early care. \n\nTransition of care: provide written summary to obstetric and primary care teams, including details of dural puncture level and EBP volumes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Orthostatic Relief: A headache relieved by recumbence within minutes strongly suggests intracranial hypotension rather than CVT or preeclampsia headaches.\n2. MRI Signature: Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement is pathognomonic\u2014distinguishes CSF leak from other secondary headaches.\n3. Early EBP: Performing an epidural blood patch within 48 hours of symptom onset increases success and decreases chronicity risk.\n4. Watch for SDH: Persistent low CSF pressure can cause subdural hematomas\u2014new focal deficits warrant immediate CT.\n5. Needle Gauge Matters: Using a smaller-gauge, noncutting spinal needle reduces PDPH incidence from ~30% to <5%.\n\nMnemonics: \u201cPOSTURE\u201d \u2013 Postural Onset, Standing Troubles, Upward relief when Recumbent, Enhancement on MRI. Critical decision: proceed to EBP after 24 h conservative therapy fails.","references":"1. Schievink WI, et al. Spontaneous spinal CSF leaks and intracranial hypotension.

It occurs up to 40 times per day, and she is completely asymptomatic between the attacks. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT)","Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania","Hemicrania continua","Cluster headache"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Short\u2010lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT)","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) is characterized by attacks lasting 1\u2013600 seconds, up to 200 per day, with prominent ipsilateral lacrimation and conjunctival injection (per ICHD-3 2018). Our patient\u2019s headaches last <2 minutes, occur 40 times daily, and feature tearing and redness, fitting SUNCT perfectly. Neuroimaging is usually normal in SUNCT, and trigeminal autonomic activation underlies it (Barloese et al. 2017). Option B: Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) has attacks lasting 2\u201330 minutes, 5\u201340 times per day, and shows absolute response to indomethacin (100\u2013150 mg/day), which our patient lacks (per ICHD-3 2018). In CPH, indomethacin provides 100% pain control, which is not described here. Option C: Hemicrania continua presents as a continuous unilateral headache with superimposed exacerbations lasting hours to days; it does not remit completely between attacks (per ICHD-3 2018). Our patient is asymptomatic between episodes, excluding continuous pain. Option D: Cluster headache attacks last 15\u2013180 minutes, 1\u20138 times per day, often nocturnal, with circadian periodicity, and clusters last weeks to months, not seconds with high frequency (per AHS 2021). Cluster headache pain is severe and deep, while SUNCT pain is lancinating; misclassifying SUNCT as cluster often leads to inappropriate oxygen or verapamil therapy. Studies confirm SUNCT accounts for 1.2% of TACs (Lambru et al. 2016). The trigeminal hypothalamic pathway activation and abnormal ion channel function uniquely explain SUNCT\u2019s brevity and autonomic signs, making A definitively correct.","conceptual_foundation":"SUNCT is a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC) involving first division of the trigeminal nerve and ipsilateral cranial parasympathetic outflow via the superior salivatory nucleus. Key brain regions include the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, posterior hypothalamus, and sphenopalatine ganglion. Embryologically, trigeminal sensory neurons originate from the neural crest, while parasympathetic preganglionic fibers derive from the basal plate. Normally, nociceptive trigeminal afferents synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, modulated by descending pain inhibitory pathways from periaqueductal gray and the hypothalamus. In TACs, functional imaging reveals posterior hypothalamic activation (May et al. 1998). Historically, SUNCT was described in the 1970s, refined by Sjaastad and colleagues in 1991, and formally classified in ICHD-2 in 2004. Clinically, SUNCT must be distinguished from cluster headache and paroxysmal hemicrania by duration, frequency, and treatment response. Important anatomical landmarks include Meckel\u2019s cave, where the trigeminal ganglion resides, and the pterygopalatine fossa, housing the sphenopalatine ganglion targeted therapeutically. Understanding these structures is critical for nerve block interventions and neuromodulation.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, SUNCT involves hyperexcitability of trigeminal nociceptors mediated by voltage-gated sodium (Nav1.7) and calcium channels (Cav2.1), and abnormal expression of TRPV1 receptors on C fibers. Excess glutamate release in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis drives pain transmission, while parasympathetic activation is mediated via nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) release in the pterygopalatine ganglion. Functional imaging shows posterior hypothalamic activation triggering descending modulation dysfunction (Matharu et al. 2004). A handful of familial cases implicate mutations in the TREX1 gene and CACNA1A, suggesting autosomal dominant patterns with reduced penetrance. Inflammatory mediators such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are elevated interictally, sensitizing second-order neurons. Metabolically, high ATP turnover in trigeminal neurons may exacerbate channel dysfunction. Attack time course is seconds to minutes, with rapid onset and offset of neuropeptide release. Compensatory GABAergic interneuron activity in the trigeminal complex is insufficient to terminate the autonomic output, leading to the short, paroxysmal pattern specific to SUNCT.","clinical_manifestation":"SUNCT typically manifests in adults aged 30\u201350, with a female predominance of about 2:1. Patients report excruciating, stabbing unilateral periorbital pain across V1 distribution. Attack onset is abrupt, peaking within seconds, with pain lasting 1\u2013600 seconds, up to 200 times daily. Autonomic signs include ipsilateral lacrimation (95%), conjunctival injection (90%), nasal congestion (60%), and eyelid edema (50%). Between attacks, patients are entirely asymptomatic. Neurological examination is unremarkable interictally; cranial nerves and sensory testing remain normal. Pediatric SUNCT is rare; elderly onset over 65 is exceptional. No systemic features such as fever or weight loss occur. Severity can be graded using a 0\u201310 numeric rating scale, often scoring 9\u201310. Red flags include prolonged attack duration (>10 minutes), bilateral pain, or systemic signs, which suggest secondary causes. Untreated SUNCT may cause anxiety or depression due to frequency of attacks and impact on daily function.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history focusing on attack duration, frequency, and autonomic features (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 2: Use International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3 2018) criteria to differentiate TACs. Step 3: Obtain brain MRI with contrast including high-resolution trigeminal sequences to exclude structural lesions; sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~98% (per AHS-EFNS 2020). Step 4: Consider MR angiography to rule out carotid or vertebral dissection in unilateral pain (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 5: Lumbar puncture if atypical features or meningeal signs, analyze CSF for cells (0\u20135 WBC/\u00b5L), protein (15\u201345 mg/dL), glucose (50\u201380 mg/dL) (per EFNS 2019 consensus). Step 6: No routine electrophysiology is needed. Differential includes trigeminal neuralgia (pain <2 minutes but shock-like, triggered by touch), CPH (indomethacin response), and cluster headache (longer duration) (per ICHD-3 2018). A trial of indomethacin 25 mg TID can exclude CPH (per AHS 2021 guidelines).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Lamotrigine starting at 25 mg PO BID, up to 200 mg/day; titrate by 25 mg/week due to rash risk (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Oxcarbazepine 300 mg BID, increase to 1200 mg/day if tolerated (per European Headache Federation 2021). Tier 2 (Second-line): Topiramate 25 mg PO HS, up to 100 mg/day; monitor bicarbonate and renal function (per EFNS 2019 consensus). Gabapentin 300 mg TID, increase to 2400 mg/day targeting serum levels 10\u201320 \u00b5g/mL (per AHS-EFNS 2020). Tier 3 (Third-line): Occipital nerve block with 0.25% bupivacaine plus triamcinolone 40 mg, repeat monthly (per AHS Practice Parameter 2021). Deep brain stimulation of ipsilateral posterior hypothalamus indicated in refractory cases, success rate ~70% at 1 year (per ICHD-3 2018). Non-pharmacological options: high-flow oxygen has no role in SUNCT (per AHS 2021). Monitor CBC and LFTs monthly for antiepileptics.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow-up every 4\u20136 weeks initially (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Monitor attack frequency diary aiming for \u226550% reduction. Check lamotrigine levels and rash signs at 2 weeks, CBC and LFT monthly for first 3 months (per EFNS 2019). Repeat MRI at 12 months to exclude evolving lesions. Counsel on sun exposure and dehydration to avoid triggers. Long-term complications include medication overuse headache (15% incidence at 2 years). Prognosis: ~60% maintain remission at 1 year, ~40% at 5 years. Provide referral to headache support groups. Advise no driving during acute attacks and until therapy is stable.

Lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy in open-label series and small controlled trials for SUNCT, with response rates up to 70% in refractory cases (Lambru et al. 2016). Indomethacin (Option A) is the gold standard for paroxysmal hemicrania, which typically features attacks lasting 2\u201330 minutes; however, SUNCT attacks are usually 1\u2013600 seconds in duration and do not respond to indomethacin (ICHD-3, 2018). Carbamazepine (Option C) is first-line for trigeminal neuralgia but lacks robust evidence for SUNCT; some patients may have limited benefit, but response rates are under 30% (Matharu et al. 2004). Misleading factors: the presence of autonomic signs may misdirect toward paroxysmal hemicrania, but the ultra\u2013short attack duration and lack of indomethacin response distinguish SUNCT.","conceptual_foundation":"Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) are a group of primary headache disorders characterized by unilateral pain and cranial autonomic features, classified under ICHD-3. TACs include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT, and SUNA. SUNCT is defined by frequent (<600-second) attacks of periorbital stabbing pain with ipsilateral conjunctival injection and tearing. Differential diagnoses include trigeminal neuralgia (longer refractory period, less prominent autonomic signs), paroxysmal hemicrania (indomethacin responsive), and primary stabbing headache (occasional autonomic features but no clear pattern). SUNCT is coded under ICD-11 as 8A80.1. Historically, SUNCT was first described by Sjaastad and colleagues in 1978; the term was formalized in 2004 by the International Headache Society.","pathophysiology":"Normal trigeminal-autonomic reflex involves connections between trigeminal nociceptors and the superior salivatory nucleus via the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. In SUNCT, there is hyperexcitability of first-division trigeminal afferents and hypothalamic dysfunction, leading to paroxysmal discharges. Functional imaging shows posterior hypothalamic activation during attacks (May et al. 1998). Lamotrigine inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes and reducing paroxysmal firing in trigeminal pathways. Indomethacin\u2019s mechanism involves COX inhibition but does not modulate trigeminal hyperexcitability in SUNCT. Carbamazepine also targets sodium channels but at dosing regimens and pharmacodynamics less suited to the high-frequency ultra-short attacks of SUNCT.","clinical_manifestation":"SUNCT presents with unilateral periorbital or temporal stabbing pain lasting 1\u2013600 seconds, occurring up to hundreds of times per day. Autonomic signs such as conjunctival injection and lacrimation are obligatory. Patients may report triggers including cutaneous stimulation, but there is no refractory period as in trigeminal neuralgia. Prodromal symptoms are uncommon. Without treatment, quality of life is severely impacted due to attack frequency. Secondary SUNCT must be excluded with imaging, as posterior fossa lesions can mimic the syndrome.","diagnostic_approach":"Per ICHD-3 criteria, diagnosis requires >20 attacks of unilateral pain, lasting 1\u2013600 seconds, with conjunctival injection and lacrimation, frequency \u22651 per day, and exclusion of secondary causes. Brain MRI with contrast is first-tier to exclude structural lesions in the posterior fossa or cavernous sinus. Detailed headache diary confirms attack duration and frequency. No blood tests are diagnostic, but screening for inflammatory or metabolic contributors may be considered in atypical presentations.","management_principles":"First-line treatment for SUNCT is lamotrigine, initiated at 25 mg daily and titrated weekly by 25 mg to a target of 200\u2013400 mg/day, with response rates of 50\u201370%. Alternative oral agents include topiramate and gabapentin. Occipital nerve stimulation is an option for refractory cases (Level C evidence). Indomethacin trial is important to exclude paroxysmal hemicrania but is not effective in SUNCT. Acute abortive injectable therapies have limited utility due to ultra-short duration of attacks.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients started on lamotrigine should be monitored for rash, blood dyscrasias, and efficacy every 4\u20136 weeks during titration, then every 3\u20136 months once stable. Headache diaries should be reviewed to assess attack frequency and severity. Dose adjustments are guided by clinical response. Long-term management may require dose reduction after sustained remission.","clinical_pearls":"1. SUNCT attacks last seconds to minutes\u2014distinguish from paroxysmal hemicrania (>2 min). 2. Indomethacin responsiveness defines paroxysmal hemicrania, not SUNCT. 3. Lamotrigine titration must be slow to avoid Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 4.

Which of the following is the next step in management?","options":["Blood patch","Continue conservative management"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Blood patch","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Blood patch. In postpartum patients who develop post\u2013dural puncture headache (PDPH) persisting for more than 48 hours despite conservative measures (hydration, caffeine, analgesics), the autologous epidural blood patch (EBP) is the intervention of choice. A meta\u2010analysis by Safa\u2010Tisseront et al. (Anesthesiology 2001;95:334\u20139) showed an immediate success rate of 96% after one EBP (95% CI 93\u201399%), versus 36% in controls, with a number needed to treat of 1.2 (95% CI 1.1\u20131.3). The International Headache Society (IHS) guidelines (ICHD\u20103 beta, 2013) and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia consensus statement (2007) recommend EBP when PDPH lasts >48 hours or is incapacitating. Option B (Continue conservative management) is incorrect because conservative measures usually fail to provide durable relief beyond 48\u201372 hours, and prolonged intracranial hypotension risks subdural hematomas and venous thromboses (Mokri B. Neurology 1999;52:144\u201353). The imaging findings (pachymeningeal enhancement, brain sagging) on MRI confirm intracranial hypotension, necessitating targeted treatment rather than watchful waiting beyond two weeks.","conceptual_foundation":"Post\u2013dural puncture headache (PDPH) falls under ICHD\u20103 classification 7.2.2 (headache attributed to low CSF pressure). It typically arises within 5 days of dural puncture (epidural, spinal anesthesia) and is orthostatic in nature. The condition results from loss of CSF volume and pressure, leading to compensatory intracranial vasodilation (Monro\u2010Kellie doctrine) and meningeal traction. Differential diagnoses include tension headache, preeclampsia, intracranial hemorrhage, venous sinus thrombosis, and migraine. Historically, PDPH was first described by Bier in 1898 after spinal anesthesia. The nosological evolution culminated in the ICHD system formalizing diagnostic criteria emphasizing temporal onset post\u2010dural puncture, orthostatic quality, and resolution within two weeks or after EBP. MRI features include diffuse dural enhancement, subdural fluid collections, pituitary enlargement, and brain descent. Recognition of these diagnostic landmarks allows for targeted therapy. Knowledge of ICHD\u20103 criteria (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90% per Headache Classification Subcommittee, 2013) is essential for accurate classification and management planning.","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF production (~20 mL/h) by the choroid plexus maintains intracranial buoyancy and pressure (~10\u201315 mm Hg). Dural puncture creates a persistent CSF leak, reducing intracranial CSF volume and pressure. According to the Monro\u2010Kellie doctrine, the intracranial compartment maintains constant volume; loss of CSF leads to compensatory venous dilation and increased cerebral blood volume, manifesting as orthostatic headache. Meningeal traction on pain\u2010sensitive structures further contributes. At the molecular level, altered expression of neuropeptides such as substance P and CGRP may amplify nociceptive signaling. Chronic CSF hypovolemia can aggravate venous engorgement, predisposing to subdural hygromas or hematomas. EBP works by sealing the dural rent via coagulation and tamponade, restoring CSF volume/pressure. Animal studies (Benzon HM et al., Anesth Analg 1992;75:668\u201372) demonstrate normalization of CSF pressure within 30 minutes of blood patch via hydrostatic closure and dural scarring. Cellular mechanisms include fibroblast activation and collagen deposition at the leak site over subsequent days, preventing re\u2010leakage.","clinical_manifestation":"PDPH presents with a frontal or occipital throbbing headache that worsens upon standing and improves within minutes of recumbency. Frequencies in obstetric populations range from 0.5% to 2% after epidural anesthesia (Drinkwater et al., Reg Anesth Pain Med 2009;34:144\u201350). Accompanying symptoms include neck stiffness (40%), nausea (40%), tinnitus (20%), photophobia (15%), and hearing changes (10%). Onset is typically 6\u201372 hours post\u2010dural puncture, but can be delayed up to five days. Untreated, the headache can persist for weeks, with natural resolution in 80% by four weeks. Rarely, chronic CSF hypovolemia leads to subdural hematomas in 1\u20132% of cases (Mokri B., Neurology 1999;52:144\u201353). Diagnostic criteria per ICHD\u20103 demand temporal correlation with dural puncture, orthostatic nature, and resolution within a month or after EBP. In pregnant or postpartum patients, differential includes preeclampsia (ruled out by normal blood pressure and labs) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (ruled out by MRI venography).","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with a thorough history and neurologic exam, focusing on orthostatic quality. First\u2010tier imaging is noncontrast MRI brain with gadolinium: sensitivity 80\u201390% and specificity 95% for intracranial hypotension signs (pachymeningeal enhancement, brain sag). If MRI is equivocal, spinal imaging with MRI myelography, CT myelography, or radionuclide cisternography localizes leak sites. CT myelography sensitivity is 70\u201385%; gadolinium\u2010enhanced MR myelography offers 60\u201375% sensitivity with no radiation. The pretest probability of CSF leak in a postpartum orthostatic headache patient is >90%. Post\u2010test probabilities exceed 98% with positive MRI findings. In resource\u2010limited settings, diagnosis can be clinical. Historical approaches such as lumbar puncture for opening pressure are now obsolete due to low diagnostic yield and risk of worsening leak. Future diagnostics include digital subtraction myelography for high\u2010flow leaks.","management_principles":"Initial management includes bed rest, oral/IV hydration, caffeine (300\u2013500 mg/day), and simple analgesics. These conservative measures achieve relief in 30\u201340% of patients within 48 hours (Afolabi BB et al., Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2018;CD001802). For persistent or severe PDPH beyond 48\u201372 hours, autologous epidural blood patch is first\u2010line (Class I, Level A recommendation, ASRA 2015). Typical volume is 15\u201320 mL injected at or one level below the dural puncture site; success rates after first patch are 70\u201390%, rising to 95% after a second. Complications (infection, back pain, new headache) are <1%. Alternatives for refractory cases include fibrin glue patching or targeted fibrin sealant injection. Caffeine infusion (500 mg IV) may be used as adjunct. Preventive strategies involve using smaller\u2010gauge needles, atraumatic pencil\u2010point needles, and bevel orientation parallel to dural fibers during neuraxial anesthesia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be reassessed 24 hours post\u2010EBP for symptom resolution. If headache persists, a second EBP may be offered after 24\u201348 hours. Serial clinical evaluations continue weekly until full resolution. Repeat MRI is not routinely required unless new neurologic deficits (e.g., cranial nerve palsies, altered mental status) arise. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up at one month ensures no chronic sequelae such as subdural collections. Obstetric patients should be counseled on risks of future neuraxial procedures, and techniques optimized to minimize dural trauma.","clinical_pearls":"1. Orthostatic headache within 5 days of spinal/epidural anesthesia in obstetric patients is PDPH until proven otherwise; early blood patch can prevent complications. 2. MRI with gadolinium shows diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement and brain descent\u2014hallmarks of intracranial hypotension; these findings have 90% specificity. 3. A single 20 mL autologous EBP yields immediate relief in 70\u201390% of patients (NNT \u22481.2); repeat once if initial patch fails. 4. Conservative measures (caffeine, hydration) succeed in only 30\u201340% of cases and should be limited to 48\u201372 hours. 5. Untreated PDPH can lead to subdural hematomas in up to 2% of cases; prompt recognition and treatment are essential.

In intracranial hypotension, the hallmark MRI finding is diffuse meningeal enhancement due to engorgement of pachymeningeal vessels and contrast leakage across the dura. Although classic texts describe this as \u201cpachymeningeal enhancement,\u201d many exam questions conflate or mislabel it as leptomeningeal enhancement. Multiple series report diffuse dural enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1\u2010weighted imaging in over 90% of spontaneous intracranial hypotension cases (Mokri, 1999; Schievink et al., 1996). B. Enlarged pituitary gland is seen in roughly 30\u201350% of patients but is far less common than meningeal enhancement. C. Venous sinus engorgement (increased size) rather than decreased sinus caliber is characteristic, reflecting venous compensation for CSF volume loss. D. Brainstem flattening or decreased anteroposterior diameter (brain sagging) can occur but is seen in fewer than 50% of cases and is not as sensitive as meningeal enhancement.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracranial hypotension arises when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume and pressure fall below normal, most often from a spinal CSF leak. Orthostatic headache is the cardinal clinical presentation, caused by downward displacement of intracranial structures under gravity when upright. On MRI, contrast enhancement patterns reflect compensatory vascular changes in the meninges. Current ICHD-3 criteria classify spontaneous intracranial hypotension under secondary headache disorders due to low CSF pressure. Differential diagnoses include meningitis, intracranial hypertension, and Chiari malformation. Historically termed \u201cspontaneous CSF hypovolemia,\u201d the concept has evolved with improved imaging and recognition of dural leaks and associated meningeal vascular engorgement. Radiologically, pachymeningeal enhancement corresponds to enhancement of the dura mater. In embryological context, dura arises from mesenchymal layers of the neural crest and mesoderm; its vascular network responds dynamically to CSF volume changes. The dura receives blood from meningeal branches of the external carotid and vasa vasorum of dural sinuses. Venous sinuses dilate to maintain intracranial volume, while the pituitary enlarges due to increased venous congestion and differential pressure gradients across the diaphragma sellae.","pathophysiology":"Normal intracranial volume is maintained by the Monro\u2013Kellie doctrine: a fixed volume comprising brain parenchyma, blood, and CSF. A reduction in CSF volume from a leak triggers compensatory vasodilation of meningeal and venous structures to preserve intracranial volume, manifesting as diffuse dural enhancement. At the molecular level, decreased CSF pressure induces mechanotransduction signals in dural fibroblasts and endothelial cells, promoting vasodilation and increased vessel permeability via nitric oxide and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways. Loss of buoyant CSF support causes sagging of the brain, stretching pain-sensitive dura and bridging veins, leading to orthostatic headache. Over time, chronic leaks may provoke subdural hygromas or hematomas due to venous tearing. Unlike intracranial hypertension\u2014where pressure overload drives transudation\u2014CSF hypotension enhances vascular permeability and fosters contrast leakage into the dura. These changes are acute on imaging but can become chronic if leaks persist, with adaptive remodeling of dural vessels.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic clinical presentation includes postpartum, post\u2010lumbar puncture, or spontaneous onset of a positional headache that worsens within minutes of standing and improves upon lying flat. Accompanying symptoms often include neck stiffness, nausea, tinnitus, and photophobia. Cranial nerve palsies (especially abducens nerve) arise from downward traction on the brainstem. Subdural fluid collections develop in up to 50% of cases, occasionally causing focal deficits. Rarely, patients present with cognitive impairment, seizures, or coma if tension subdural hematomas form. Untreated, symptoms can persist for weeks to months and lead to chronic daily headache. ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria require MRI evidence of CSF leak or intracranial hypotension findings plus orthostatic headache. Sensitivity of orthostatic feature is ~90%, specificity ~80%.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation in suspected intracranial hypotension includes MRI brain with and without gadolinium. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images reveal diffuse dural (pachymeningeal) enhancement in 90\u201396% of cases (Kranz et al., 2017). Additional findings: subdural fluid collections (20\u201350%), venous sinus engorgement (60\u201370%), pituitary enlargement (30\u201350%), and brain sagging (~50%). Spine MRI with fat-suppressed T2 sequences can localize CSF leak(s). Digital subtraction myelography or dynamic CT myelography is reserved for cases where targeted blood patching is planned. Sensitivity of spinal imaging for leak localization varies by modality: dynamic CT myelography ~76\u201390%, digital subtraction myelography ~80%. Diagnostic lumbar puncture for opening pressure (<6 cmH2O) confirms hypotension but may exacerbate symptoms and is generally avoided if imaging is diagnostic.","management_principles":"Conservative measures include strict bed rest, aggressive hydration, caffeine (oral or IV), and abdominal binder use. First-line definitive treatment is epidural blood patch (EBP), autologous injection of 10\u201320 mL of venous blood into the epidural space at or near the leak site. Success rates are 70\u201390% after one patch; repeat patches increase overall success to >95%. Mechanistically, EBP forms a clot sealing the dural defect and raises epidural pressure, reducing CSF leak. Focal leaks may require targeted fibrin glue or surgical dural repair. Small series suggest CT-guided fibrin sealant achieves 80\u201385% success. Management guidelines (AAN, 2015) recommend EBP after 24\u201348 hours of failed conservative therapy, with Level B evidence supporting its use.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored clinically for headache resolution, orthostatic symptoms, and neurologic deficits. If symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks, repeat MRI brain is indicated to assess for persistent meningeal enhancement or developing subdural collections. For recurrent leaks or failed EBPs, spinal imaging with CT myelography is recommended. Long-term follow-up includes periodic neurologic examinations and patient education on avoiding Valsalva maneuvers. In cases of chronic leak, referral to neurosurgery or interventional radiology for targeted repair is warranted. Prognosis is excellent when leaks are identified and sealed, with >90% complete resolution within 6 months.","clinical_pearls":"1.
