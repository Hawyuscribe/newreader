[{"question_number":"3","question":"In a patient with HIV on HAART presenting with multiple lesions with ring enhancement, which of the following treatments is appropriate?","options":["Praziquantel","Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)","Both A and B","None of the above"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"TMP-SMX is an effective treatment for cerebral toxoplasmosis presenting as multiple ring-enhancing lesions in HIV-infected patients. Multiple studies and guidelines (e.g., AAN 2018 Practice Parameter) recognize TMP-SMX as an alternative to pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine with similar efficacy and better tolerability (efficacy ~75\u201380%, Skiest et al. 1993). Praziquantel is indicated for neurocysticercosis, not toxoplasmosis, and thus A is incorrect. Combination therapy of praziquantel and TMP-SMX (C) is not supported without evidence of co-infection. D is incorrect because TMP-SMX alone is appropriate for toxoplasmosis in this context.","conceptual_foundation":"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoon. In immunocompetent hosts, infection is often asymptomatic and latent cysts persist in muscle and brain. In advanced HIV (CD4 <100 cells/\u00b5L) reactivation leads to focal cerebral lesions. On MRI these appear as multiple, bilateral ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding edema. ICD-11 classifies toxoplasmosis under 1F80. Related conditions include primary CNS lymphoma and neurocysticercosis; differential is based on imaging characteristics, serology, and clinical response.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, latent bradyzoites remain quiescent within tissue cysts. HIV-induced CD4 depletion allows conversion to tachyzoites, which invade neural and glial cells causing necrotizing inflammation. The host immune response forms granulomatous rings, visualized as ring-enhancing lesions. TMP-SMX inhibits folate synthesis by blocking dihydropteroate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase in T. gondii, leading to parasite death. In contrast, praziquantel increases parasite membrane permeability to calcium, effective against helminths but not protozoa.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with headache (70\u201390%), focal neurological deficits (50\u201360%, e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia), fever (30\u201340%), and seizures (15\u201320%). Symptoms develop subacutely over days to weeks. Rarely, cognitive changes or altered consciousness occur. Multiple lesions in basal ganglia or corticomedullary junction are common.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI brain with contrast demonstrates multiple ring-enhancing lesions with eccentric target sign (specificity ~90%). Serum Toxoplasma IgG has sensitivity ~95% but low specificity; a negative IgG effectively rules out toxo. Empiric therapy with TMP-SMX (5 mg/kg TMP and 25 mg/kg SMX BID) is started. Second-tier: follow-up MRI at 2\u20134 weeks assesses lesion resolution (NNT to detect non-responders ~6). Brain biopsy (third-tier) reserved for non-responders or atypical imaging.","management_principles":"TMP-SMX is dosed at TMP 5 mg/kg and SMX 25 mg/kg orally twice daily for 6 weeks, followed by maintenance prophylaxis (TMP 160 mg/SMX 800 mg daily) until CD4 >200 for >6 months. Adverse effects include rash (10\u201315%), cytopenias (5\u201310%), and renal dysfunction (2\u20135%). Alternative first-line regimen per AAN is pyrimethamine (50\u201375 mg/day) plus sulfadiazine (1\u20131.5 g QID) with leucovorin (10\u201325 mg/day).","follow_up_guidelines":"MRI after 2\u20134 weeks to confirm \u226525% reduction in lesion size. If no improvement, consider alternative diagnosis or brain biopsy. Continue maintenance prophylaxis until sustained CD4 >200 cells/\u00b5L for at least 6 months. Regular monitoring of CBC and renal function every 2\u20134 weeks during induction and monthly during maintenance is recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. TMP-SMX prophylaxis at standard doses prevents both PJP and toxoplasmosis in HIV with CD4 <100. 2. Multiple ring-enhancing lesions in HIV are more likely toxoplasmosis than lymphoma; empiric therapy is diagnostic and therapeutic. 3. Eccentric target sign on MRI has specificity ~95% for toxo. 4. Lack of response after 2 weeks should prompt reconsideration of diagnosis. 5. Steroids are reserved only for mass effect causing midline shift or raised ICP.","references":"1. Skiest DJ, et al.

Lupus cerebritis (Option B) typically presents with more diffuse CNS manifestations without focal temporal lobe lesions on MRI. Cerebral venous thrombosis (Option C) may cause headache, seizures, and focal deficits but produces venous infarcts on MRI rather than bilateral temporal hyperintensities. PRES (Option D) usually shows parieto-occipital vasogenic edema on MRI and is associated with hypertension rather than temporal lobe involvement.","conceptual_foundation":"HSV-1 encephalitis is the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in adults, targeting the inferior and medial temporal lobes. The virus travels retrogradely via the trigeminal or olfactory pathways. SLE patients on immunosuppression are at increased risk for opportunistic infections including HSV. Temporal lobe involvement manifests as personality changes, memory loss, focal seizures, and CSF pleocytosis.","pathophysiology":"HSV infects neurons and glia, replicating within the temporal lobe and causing cytolytic destruction. The host immune response to viral replication leads to inflammation, edema, and blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. MRI T2/FLAIR sequences show hyperintense lesions in the medial temporal lobes and orbitofrontal cortex.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical presentation includes acute fever, headache, altered mental status, focal seizures (often temporal lobe semiology), and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal or mildly elevated protein. Without treatment, mortality approaches 70%.","diagnostic_approach":"Empiric acyclovir should be started immediately when HSV encephalitis is suspected. CSF PCR for HSV DNA has >95% sensitivity and specificity. Brain MRI is superior to CT for early temporal lobe changes.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is caused by transmissible prions that resist standard sterilization and can be transmitted via contaminated tissue. International guidelines (e.g., WHO, AAN) contraindicate organ donation from CJD patients. Options A and C would risk iatrogenic transmission to recipients.","conceptual_foundation":"CJD is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) caused by misfolded prion proteins (PrP^Sc). In ICD-11 TSEs are coded under 1E2. Prion diseases include sporadic, familial, variant, and iatrogenic forms. The transmissibility of prions through neurosurgical instruments, dura mater grafts, and corneal transplants is well documented, leading to strict regulatory controls on donation.","pathophysiology":"Normal PrP^C is a cellular glycoprotein; misfolded PrP^Sc induces conformational change in native PrP, leading to amyloid fibril formation, neuronal loss, spongiform change, and astrocytosis. Prions resist proteases and standard autoclaving, making decontamination challenging and enabling transmission via tissues containing residual prion aggregates.","clinical_manifestation":"CJD presents in middle to late adulthood with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, visual symptoms, cerebellar ataxia, and akinetic mutism. EEG shows periodic sharp wave complexes; MRI DWI/FLAIR demonstrates cortical ribboning and basal ganglia hyperintensities; CSF 14-3-3 protein and RT-QuIC assay support diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on clinical criteria supplemented by MRI, EEG, CSF biomarkers (14-3-3, tau, RT-QuIC). Definitive diagnosis requires neuropathology demonstrating PrP^Sc. Before organ donation, assessment must exclude prion diseases per national transplant guidelines.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying treatments exist. Care is supportive, addressing myoclonus (clonazepam, valproate), behavioral symptoms, and palliative measures. Strict infection control protocols apply to surgical instruments and tissue handling.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up of CJD patients focuses on symptomatic management and infection control. Families should receive genetic counseling if familial CJD is suspected. Reporting to public health authorities is required for surveillance.","clinical_pearls":"1.

HAART. In HIV patients with MRI findings of non-enhancing posterior white matter hyperintensities consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), the primary treatment is initiation or optimization of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART restores immune function, leading to suppression of JC virus replication and stabilization or improvement of PML lesions. Option B (fluconazole) is used for cryptococcal meningitis, not PML, and would have no effect on JC virus.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is caused by reactivation of JC polyomavirus in the setting of severe immunosuppression. The classic MRI appearance is bilateral but asymmetric, non-enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the subcortical white matter without mass effect. Risk correlates with CD4 count <100 cells/mm3. Diagnosis is clinical combined with MRI and CSF PCR for JC virus.","pathophysiology":"JC virus infects oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, leading to focal demyelination. In immunosuppressed hosts, viral replication increases, causing oligodendrocyte lysis, loss of myelin, and progressive neurological deficits. HAART reconstitutes cellular immunity (especially CD4+ T-cells), reducing viral load and allowing clearance of infected glia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present subacutely over weeks to months with focal deficits\u2014visual field cuts, hemiparesis, ataxia, or cognitive decline\u2014depending on lesion location. Fever and meningeal signs are usually absent. The course without treatment is relentlessly progressive.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on MRI findings plus detection of JC virus DNA in CSF by PCR (sensitivity ~75\u201390%, specificity >95%). Brain biopsy is reserved for PCR-negative cases with high clinical suspicion. Lumbar puncture is safe with no mass effect.","management_principles":"There is no specific antiviral for JC virus. HAART is first-line (AAN guideline, Level B evidence). Initiate or optimize antiretroviral therapy to achieve CD4 recovery and reduce JC viral load.

Oral doxycycline may be used for isolated facial palsy without other neurologic signs, but bilateral involvement with CSF changes warrants IV therapy. There are no alternative options listed; thus, ceftriaxone is both evidence-based and guideline-endorsed.","conceptual_foundation":"Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, ICD-11: 1F62, transmitted by Ixodes ticks.

Historically described in Connecticut, 1975; spirochetal etiology discovered 1982. Facial nerve involvement results from spirochetal invasion of the perineurium and endoneurial inflammatory response.","pathophysiology":"Borrelia burgdorferi disseminates hematogenously from the tick bite site, crossing the blood\u2013nerve barrier via endoneurial capillaries. Spirochetes elicit a lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate in the subarachnoid space, cranial nerve roots, and dorsal root ganglia. Cytokine milieu includes IL-6 and CXCL13 in CSF. Bilateral facial palsy results from neuritis and demyelination induced by spirochete antigens.","clinical_manifestation":"Lyme neuroborreliosis typically presents 2\u201312 weeks after erythema migrans. Common features: lymphocytic meningitis (CSF WBC 50\u2013500 cells/mm\u00b3), cranial neuritis (facial > trigeminal), radiculoneuritis, and rarely encephalomyelitis.
