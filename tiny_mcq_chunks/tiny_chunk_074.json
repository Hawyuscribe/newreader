[{"question_number":"4","question":"A patient with a radial fracture one month ago complains of pain and erythema. Examination was difficult because of pain. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Complex regional pain syndrome","Arterial insufficiency","Dejerine Roussy syndrome"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Complex regional pain syndrome","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is the most likely diagnosis in a patient who continues to experience disproportionate pain, erythema, and swelling one month after a distal radius fracture. CRPS type I (formerly RSD) often follows minor trauma without identifiable nerve injury. Arterial insufficiency (Option B) presents with pallor, cool skin, and diminished pulses rather than erythema and warmth. Dejerine\u2013Roussy syndrome (Option C) is thalamic pain syndrome that follows central thalamic infarct and is characterized by allodynia, typically developing weeks to months after a thalamic stroke, not a peripheral fracture. Thus, the clinical features of persistent regional pain, autonomic changes (erythema), and history of fracture are pathognomonic for CRPS.","conceptual_foundation":"Complex regional pain syndrome is classified under ICD-11 code MG30.0 and involves dysregulated peripheral and central sensitization. It is differentiated into Type I (no major nerve injury) and Type II (identifiable nerve injury). The syndrome\u2019s historical evolution spans from causalgia descriptions in Civil War soldiers to \u2018\u2018Sudeck\u2019s atrophy\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018reflex sympathetic dystrophy,\u2019\u2019 culminating in the current CRPS term adopted by the IASP in 1994. Differential diagnoses include post-traumatic osteoarthritis, chronic osteomyelitis, neuropathic pain syndromes, and vascular insufficiency. CRPS is not a primary neurodegenerative or immunologic disorder, but rather a pain disorder with autonomic and trophic changes.","pathophysiology":"Normal nociceptive signaling involves balanced excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. In CRPS, peripheral sensitization is driven by upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) in the injured tissue, leading to ectopic afferent firing. Sympathetic nervous system dysregulation fosters vasomotor changes: norepinephrine spillover causes vasoconstriction early (cold phase) followed by paradoxical vasodilation (warm phase), explaining erythema. Central sensitization via NMDA receptor activation and loss of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons heightens pain perception. Microglial activation in the dorsal horn further amplifies pain signals, and cortical reorganization in S1 accounts for allodynia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CRPS present with spontaneous burning pain, hyperalgesia, allodynia, and autonomic features (erythema, temperature asymmetry, sweating changes). Trophic skin, nail, and hair changes occur over time. Symptoms evolve through an acute \u2018\u2018warm\u2019\u2019 phase (weeks to months) with prominent vasodilation and swelling, followed by a chronic \u2018\u2018cold\u2019\u2019 phase marked by skin tightening and decreased blood flow. Though most commonly affects distal limbs after fractures, it can follow surgery, sprains, or minor insults. Prevalence is approximately 5 per 100,000 per year, with a female predominance (3:1).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on the Budapest Criteria: continuing pain disproportionate to the inciting event plus at least one sign in two of four categories (sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, motor/trophic) and at least two reported symptoms. No confirmatory lab test exists; plain radiographs may show patchy demineralization. Thermography or three-phase bone scan can support the diagnosis (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%) but are not routinely required. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies rule out entrapment neuropathy. Pre-test probability is high in post-fracture persistent regional pain unresponsive to usual analgesics.","management_principles":"First-line management focuses on early, intensive physiotherapy to maintain function and desensitize the limb. NSAIDs or gabapentinoids may provide symptomatic relief. Bisphosphonates (e.g., oral alendronate) have moderate evidence (Level B) for pain reduction and improved function. Short courses of systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 0.5\u2009mg/kg tapered over 3\u2009weeks) can be beneficial in the acute inflammatory phase. For refractory cases, sympathetic nerve blocks (stellate or lumbar) or spinal cord stimulation may be considered. Psychological support and cognitive behavioral therapy are integral to address chronic pain coping.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow patients every 2\u20134\u2009weeks initially to assess pain control, function, and rehabilitation progress. Monitor for side effects of pharmacotherapy (gastric tolerance with NSAIDs, bone density with bisphosphonates). Adjust physical therapy intensity based on tolerance and functional gains. Long-term follow-up at 3, 6, and 12\u2009months evaluates recovery trajectory; about 30\u201340% of patients have persistent symptoms beyond one year. Early intervention correlates with better outcomes; delayed diagnosis often leads to chronic disability.","clinical_pearls":"1. CRPS often begins with a \u2018\u2018warm\u2019\u2019 phase (erythema, increased temperature) before progressing to a \u2018\u2018cold\u2019\u2019 phase; early diagnosis improves prognosis. 2. Budapest Criteria provide a structured clinical framework; omitting autonomic signs reduces diagnostic sensitivity. 3. Bisphosphonates can reduce pain by modulating osteoclastic activity in the affected limb. 4. Avoid immobilization; graded physiotherapy is critical to prevent stiffness and disuse. 5. Psychological factors (anxiety, catastrophizing) exacerbate pain perception and should be addressed with CBT.","references":"1. Harden RN et al.

These symptoms occur during the dialysis sessions. A computed tomography (CT) brain showed evidence of old ischemic stroke, and a carotid ultrasound showed left ICA atherosclerotic changes with no visualized stenosis or occlusion. Which of the following is important to order during the evaluation of this patient?","options":["CT angiography","MRI brain","CT venogram ## Page 6"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"CT angiography","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (CT angiography): This is the definitive correct choice, as CT angiography provides high-resolution vascular imaging with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98% for detecting extracranial and intracranial stenosis or dissection. In ESRD patients on hemodialysis with recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), dynamic changes in cerebral perfusion related to hypotension can produce watershed infarcts and microemboli in areas supplied by the left internal carotid artery (ICA). CT angiography performed with iodinated contrast at 1\u2009mL/kg and a 4\u2009mL/s injection rate during peak arterial phase (20\u201325 s after initiation) will visualize flow-limiting lesions, subtle dissections, mural thrombus, or fibromuscular dysplasia missed on ultrasound. The pathophysiological basis is measurement of luminal diameter reduction (>50% correlates with symptomatic ischemia) and assessment of collateral circulation in the circle of Willis.\n\nOption B (MRI brain): Though excellent for parenchymal detail, diffusion-weighted MRI is less sensitive to acute flow dynamics and cannot directly measure luminal stenosis or vascular wall pathology. It is useful for confirming infarct age and distinguishing acute versus chronic lesions (ADC restriction) but will not identify extracranial ICA plaque morphology or dynamic flow compromise during hypotensive dialysis episodes.\n\nOption C (CT venogram): CT venography at venous phase (60\u201370 s delay) is indicated for suspected cerebral venous thrombosis, papilledema, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Our patient presents with arterial TIAs, not venous outflow obstruction, making this test irrelevant. Its overall sensitivity for venous sinus thrombosis is 90%, but specificity drops to 75% in ESRD patients with anemia and calcified venous walls.\n\nOption D (Transcranial Doppler ultrasound): Often considered for microembolic signal detection and monitoring ICA\u2013MCA flow velocities, but has only 60\u201370% sensitivity for distal stenoses and is operator-dependent. It lacks spatial resolution compared to CT angiography, making it a suboptimal single modality in recurrent symptomatic dialysis hypotension contexts. Common misconception is assuming noninvasive ultrasound is sufficient, but guidelines from AHA/ASA recommend CT angiography as first-line in symptomatic extracranial carotid evaluation when ultrasound is inconclusive or clinical stakes are high.","conceptual_foundation":"The left internal carotid artery (ICA) originates from the common carotid bifurcation at the level of C3\u2013C4 vertebrae, ascending through the carotid canal into the cavernous sinus, then forming the circle of Willis after giving off the ophthalmic branch. Key anatomical landmarks include the carotid bulb, petrous segment, and the supraclinoid portion, which supplies the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territories. Embryologically, the ICA arises from the third aortic arch and dorsal aorta segments by week four; aberrant regression or persistence can produce carotid webs or agenesis. Normal physiological regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) involves autoregulation between mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 60\u2013160 mm Hg; hemodialysis-induced hypotension can drop MAP below 60 mm Hg, compromising collateral supply, particularly in watershed zones between ACA\u2013MCA.\n\nRelated syndromes include watershed infarcts and borderzone ischemia seen in hypotensive episodes, lacunar infarcts from small vessel lipohyalinosis, and artery-to-artery embolism in ulcerated atherosclerotic plaques. Over the past fifty years, imaging evolved from conventional angiography (Seldinger technique in 1920s) to digital subtraction angiography in the 1980s, to noninvasive CT and MR angiography in the 1990s, improving diagnostic safety and speed. Clinically, recognizing the carotid stenosis plaque morphology (echolucent vs calcified) and ulceration underpins risk stratification for TIA versus stroke. Key landmarks on CT angiography include the petrous segment narrowing and the supraclinoid ICA curve where flow patterns alter, affecting local shear stress and atherogenesis.","pathophysiology":"In ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis, recurrent hypotension triggers autoregulatory failure of cerebral arterioles. Under normal conditions, nitric oxide and endothelin-1 balance maintains vessel tone through cyclic GMP and IP3/Ca2+ pathways. With sustained MAP\u2009<\u200960 mm Hg, ATP-sensitive K+ channels open, hyperpolarizing smooth muscle cells and reducing Ca2+ influx, leading to vasodilation until exhaustion of autoregulatory capacity. Atherosclerotic plaque at the ICA exhibits endothelial dysfunction, with upregulated VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression mediated by NF-kB, promoting leukocyte adhesion, foam cell formation through oxidized LDL uptake via scavenger receptors (CD36). Plaque neovascularization involves VEGF-A release and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) from macrophages, weakening the fibrous cap and causing ulceration.\n\nDialysis-induced hypotension promotes a low-shear environment, favoring thrombogenesis via tissue factor pathway activation, thrombin generation, and platelet aggregation through GP IIb/IIIa. Nitrogenous waste retention triggers systemic inflammation with elevated IL-6 and CRP levels (often >10 mg/L), exacerbating vascular permeability and prothrombotic state. Genetic factors such as MTHFR C677T polymorphism increase homocysteine levels, damaging endothelium. Over minutes of dialysis, shifting osmolar gradients can induce cerebral edema transiently, altering blood\u2013brain barrier integrity. Compensatory collateral recruitment from the leptomeningeal vessels may delay ischemic onset but is limited in chronic kidney disease due to calcific arteriosclerosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often experience an abrupt onset of left-sided weakness and dysarthria coinciding with the mid-portion of dialysis sessions, typically 30\u201360 minutes into treatment when ultrafiltration volume exceeds 1.5 L. Symptoms peak within minutes and completely resolve by 10 minutes, aligning with TIA criteria. Neurological examination during episodes reveals mild pronator drift, 4/5 strength in left upper and lower extremities, and slurred speech without facial droop. Outside episodes, exam is normal. In pediatric populations with renal failure, TIAs may present atypically with seizures or altered mental status, whereas elderly patients often have coexisting small vessel disease and dementia.\n\nWomen on hemodialysis report higher TIA frequency by 20% compared to men, potentially due to lower baseline hemoglobin and smaller vessel diameters. Associated systemic manifestations include intradialytic hypotension (<90/60 mm Hg in 15\u201320% of sessions), tachycardia compensatory response, and nausea. Severity is graded by ABCD2 score, often 4\u20135 in this cohort. Red flags include prolonged (>60 minutes) deficits, new visual field cuts, or signs of intracranial hemorrhage (severe headache, hypertension). Without intervention, recurrent TIAs increase 90-day stroke risk to 10% and five-year stroke risk to 30%.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Initial clinical assessment and ABCD2 risk stratification. A score \u22654 warrants urgent imaging within 24 hours. Step 2: Noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 98%, specificity 95% for acute bleed). Step 3: CT angiography of head and neck with 0.5 mm slice thickness and bolus tracking to assess ICA stenosis >50%. This test sensitivity is 95%, specificity 98%. Step 4: If CT angiography inconclusive or contraindicated (contrast allergy or renal impairment), proceed to MR angiography with gadolinium-free time-of-flight sequences.\n\nStep 5: Carotid duplex ultrasound can detect peak systolic velocity >125 cm/s corresponding to >50% stenosis but is operator-dependent. Step 6: Evaluate cardiac source via transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble study for patent foramen ovale or atrial septal aneurysm. Step 7: Ambulatory ECG or telemetry for atrial fibrillation detection, given a 24-hour Holter sensitivity of 85%. Step 8: Lab tests include CBC (target hemoglobin 10\u201312 g/dL), coagulation panel (INR 2.0\u20133.0 if anticoagulated), lipid profile (LDL <70 mg/dL) and inflammatory markers (CRP <3 mg/L). CSF analysis is not indicated unless infection or subarachnoid hemorrhage suspected. Electrophysiological studies are reserved for differential diagnoses like Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.","management_principles":"First-line therapy emphasizes optimizing hemodialysis parameters: reduce ultrafiltration rate to <10 mL/kg/hr, target dry weight adjustments within \u00b11 kg. Pharmacologically, start antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily (dual therapy for high-risk TIA). Loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg followed by maintenance yields 32% relative risk reduction in stroke recurrence. Statin therapy with high-intensity atorvastatin 40\u201380 mg daily lowers LDL by 50% and reduces stroke risk by 25% in secondary prevention.\n\nSecond-line options include surgical endarterectomy for symptomatic ICA stenosis >70%, with perioperative stroke/death rates of 5%. For stenosis 50\u201369%, per AHA guidelines, endarterectomy is considered if surgical risk <6%. Carotid artery stenting with proximal protection devices is reserved for high-surgical-risk patients, with periprocedural stroke rate ~6%. Antihypertensive management targets MAP 65\u201380 mmHg during dialysis, using midodrine 2.5\u201310 mg orally 30 minutes pre-dialysis to improve tolerance. Avoid ACE inhibitors on dialysis days. Monitor platelet count weekly if on dual therapy, aiming for >100,000/\u00b5L. In renal impairment, adjust doses: clopidogrel no change, atorvastatin max 40 mg. Employ exercise rehabilitation with aerobic sessions 30 minutes thrice weekly to promote collateral growth.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up involves neurology clinic visits at two weeks, three months, and annually thereafter. Blood pressure, hemoglobin, and LDL levels should be monitored weekly during dialysis and quarterly otherwise. Repeat CT angiography at six months post-intervention to confirm patency, then annually if stable. Surveillance duplex ultrasound every three to six months can track plaque progression. Long-term complications include restenosis in 10\u201315% within two years and microvascular dementia in 20% by five years. One-year stroke-free survival is 90%, but five-year survival drops to 70% in ESRD cohorts. Rehabilitation needs include physical therapy for strength recovery, typically 12 weeks of structured sessions yielding 80% functional improvement. Patient education covers pelvic tilt maneuvers during hypotension, medication adherence reminders, and diet modifications to control phosphorus and LDL. Driving clearance usually after six months without TIA or stroke.

Anomic aphasia reflects impaired lexical retrieval without significant comprehension or repetition deficits. Option B (Wernicke\u2019s aphasia) is incorrect as that involves fluent but meaningless speech with poor comprehension, related to posterior superior temporal gyrus lesions. Option C (Transcortical motor aphasia) is marked by nonfluent speech with intact repetition, linked to frontal watershed zone lesions sparing Broca\u2019s area, which does not align with the parietal localization of Gerstmann syndrome.","conceptual_foundation":"Gerstmann syndrome comprises a constellation of four deficits\u2014finger agnosia, agraphia, acalculia, left\u2013right disorientation\u2014associated with lesions of the dominant angular gyrus (Brodmann area 39). The angular gyrus is critical for multimodal integration of visual, somatosensory, and linguistic information. Disruption leads to breakdown in semantic mapping and lexical access, producing anomic aphasia. Knowledge of cortical topography situates Gerstmann features distinctly in the inferior parietal lobule, differentiating it from perisylvian aphasic syndromes.","pathophysiology":"The angular gyrus integrates inputs from the primary visual cortex, somatosensory cortex, and Wernicke\u2019s area, facilitating conversion of percepts into semantic representations and lexical retrieval. Lesions disrupt cortico\u2013cortical association fibers (e.g., the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus III), impairing semantic\u2013phonological mapping. This selective disconnection yields preserved comprehension and repetition with isolated anomia and praxis deficits. Cellular injury involves focal ischemia or hemorrhage damaging cortical pyramidal cells and U-fibers, leading to the classic tetrad of Gerstmann signs.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients demonstrate difficulty naming commonplace objects and finding words in spontaneous speech (anomia) with intact grammar, comprehension, and repetition. They concurrently exhibit finger agnosia (inability to identify or differentiate their fingers), agraphia (impaired writing), acalculia (impaired arithmetic), and left\u2013right confusion.

Cerebral angiography shows segmental vessel constriction. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["RCVS","Aneurysm","Arteriovenous malformation","Carotid artery dissection"],"subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2018","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"RCVS","explanation":{"option_analysis":"A: Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is the definitive diagnosis in this patient. RCVS classically presents with recurrent thunderclap headaches and transient ischemic attacks. Segmental multifocal narrowing on cerebral angiography that resolves within days to months is pathognomonic. Studies estimate that RCVS accounts for approximately 50 percent of non\u2010aneurysmal thunderclap headache cases referred to tertiary headache centers, with 90 percent of patients experiencing peak headache intensity within one minute. Angiographic abnormalities typically normalize in over 80 percent of treated patients by three months. The pathophysiological basis involves transient dysregulation of cerebral arterial tone mediated by endothelin\u20101 surges, serotonin receptor hypersensitivity, and sympathetic overactivity. Common misconceptions include labeling RCVS as primary angiitis of the central nervous system; however, inflammatory markers such as ESR and CRP remain within normal limits in over 95 percent of RCVS cases, and cerebral biopsy is negative for vessel wall inflammation.\n\nB: Aneurysm rupture or unruptured saccular aneurysm might present with subarachnoid hemorrhage or sentinel headache, but angiography shows a focal outpouching rather than segmental narrowing. Approximately 30 percent of patients with aneurysmal rupture experience a mild warning headache days to weeks before catastrophic hemorrhage. In contrast to RCVS, aneurysm size greater than 7 mm increases rupture risk by roughly 1 percent per year. A focal aneurysm would not resolve spontaneously on follow-up angiography, and there would be evidence of hemorrhage on CT or lumbar puncture.\n\nC: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) typically causes seizures, chronic headache, or intracerebral hemorrhage. Digital subtraction angiography reveals a vascular nidus with early venous drainage, not a reversible string\u2010of\u2010beads narrowing. Prevalence of cerebral AVM is about 10 per 100,000. Wrong choice arises from confusing any vascular abnormality with segmental vasoconstriction, but AVM flow voids on MRI and early venous filling on angiography distinguish it clearly.\n\nD: Carotid artery dissection often presents with ipsilateral head or neck pain, Horner syndrome, and acute ischemic stroke. Angiography may show a tapered or irregular focal stenosis, pseudoaneurysm, or double lumen rather than diffuse multifocal constriction. Incidence is roughly 2.6 per 100,000 per year. The clinical context of neck trauma, connective tissue disorder, or fibromuscular dysplasia helps distinguish dissections from RCVS, and carotid imaging protocols include fat\u2010suppressed MRI sequences for intramural hematoma identification.","conceptual_foundation":"The arterial circulation of the brain arises from paired internal carotid arteries anteriorly and paired vertebral arteries posteriorly, which join to form the basilar artery. Major branches include the anterior cerebral arteries supplying medial frontal lobes, middle cerebral arteries feeding lateral convexities, and posterior cerebral arteries serving occipital lobes. Small penetrating arteries such as lenticulostriate vessels supply deep basal ganglia and internal capsule. RCVS primarily involves medium\u2010sized intradural arteries in the circle of Willis and its branches. Embryologically, cerebral vessels originate from the aortic arches and dorsal aorta; the vertebrobasilar system arises from longitudinal neural arteries. Normal cerebrovascular regulation depends on neurovascular coupling, endothelial nitric oxide, myogenic tone, and autonomic innervation. Cerebral autoregulation is maintained over mean arterial pressures between 60 and 160 mm\u2009Hg. Related conditions include primary angiitis of the central nervous system, fibromuscular dysplasia, and drug\u2010induced vasospasm. Historically, thunderclap headache with reversible angiographic findings was first described in case reports in the 1980s, but the term RCVS was coined in the late 1990s. Landmark imaging correlation studies in the 2000s defined diagnostic criteria, and the syndrome has since been recognized by the International Headache Society. Key anatomical landmarks such as the terminal internal carotid artery, circle of Willis segments A1 to A5, M1 to M4 segments of the middle cerebral artery, and P1 to P3 segments of the posterior cerebral artery are critical for angiographic evaluation and interventional planning.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, RCVS involves dysregulation of vascular smooth muscle cell receptors, including overactivation of endothelin\u20101 ETA receptors and hypersensitivity of 5\u2010HT2A serotonin receptors. Excess sympathetic discharge leads to catecholamine spillover, activating alpha\u2010adrenergic receptors and inducing vasoconstriction. Intracellular calcium influx is mediated by L\u2010type voltage\u2010gated calcium channels, promoting sustained smooth muscle contraction. Nitric oxide synthase activity may be transiently suppressed, reducing vasodilatory nitric oxide levels. Repeated vasospastic episodes can trigger endothelial injury and transient blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Genetic predisposition is suggested by rare cases associated with mutations in the collagen gene COL3A1 and familial fibromuscular dysplasia patterns. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin\u20106 and tumor necrosis factor alpha remain within normal limits in the majority of cases, distinguishing RCVS from vasculitis. Metabolic demands are preserved due to collateral recruitment, but recurrent vasoconstriction can provoke transient ischemia and cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage. The time course of vasoconstriction peaks within the first one to two weeks, plateaus, and then gradually resolves over two to three months. Compensatory mechanisms include autoregulatory dilation of leptomeningeal collaterals, but repeated episodes can exhaust the reserve and lead to ischemic infarcts. Resolution of angiographic abnormalities in over 80 percent of patients by 12 weeks confirms the reversible nature of the underlying vascular dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with RCVS typically experience sudden onset thunderclap headaches, reaching peak intensity within 30 seconds in approximately 90 percent of cases. Headache episodes recur over days to weeks, often triggered by exertion, Valsalva maneuvers, emotional stress, or exposure to vasoactive substances such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or sympathomimetics. Transient ischemic attacks occur in roughly 10 to 20 percent of patients, manifesting as brief focal deficits lasting less than one hour in motor, sensory, or visual domains. Neurological examination between headaches is often normal but may reveal subtle cortical deficits if silent infarcts occur. In pediatric cases, RCVS is rarer but presents similarly with thunderclap headache and correlates with stimulant exposure; in the elderly, vessel stiffness may blunt headache intensity but increase ischemic complications. Women account for about 70 percent of cases, particularly in the postpartum period within one week of delivery. Systemic manifestations such as hypertension and mild nausea can accompany headache, but fever is absent in over 95 percent. Severity is graded on a headache numeric rating scale and imaging\u2010based vasoconstriction severity index. Without treatment, headache frequency peaks during the first week and spontaneously diminishes by three months, but permanent deficits occur in up to 5 percent of untreated cases.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity approximately 95 percent within six hours of onset). If CT is normal, a lumbar puncture is performed to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage; cerebrospinal fluid red cell count less than 10 cells/mm3 and normal xanthochromia support RCVS. First\u2010line imaging is CT angiography with sensitivity of 80 percent for medium\u2010vessel narrowing. If CTA is inconclusive, digital subtraction cerebral angiography provides 95 percent sensitivity and 98 percent specificity for segmental vasoconstriction. Angiographic protocol includes three\u2010dimensional rotational imaging of anterior and posterior circulations, with attention to M1\u2013M3 and A1\u2013A3 segments. Laboratory testing includes ESR, CRP, ANA, ANCA, and complement levels, all of which are normal in over 90 percent of cases, ruling out vasculitis. Second\u2010line tests such as vessel wall MRI with black\u2010blood sequences exclude inflammatory mural enhancement. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can monitor blood flow velocities, which rise above 200 cm/s in severe vasospasm. Differential diagnosis includes primary angiitis of the central nervous system, reversible vasospasm due to cocaine or amphetamines, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, distinguished by elevated blood pressure, characteristic MRI edema patterns, or inflammatory CSF findings.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy for RCVS centers on calcium channel blockers. Nimodipine is dosed at 60 mg orally every four hours, initiated within 24 hours of diagnosis and continued for four to twelve weeks. Verapamil at 120 mg orally three times daily may be substituted in the case of hypotension. Intravenous magnesium sulfate administered as a 4 g loading dose over 30 minutes followed by 1 g per hour infusion for 48 hours can reduce vasospasm. Second\u2010line options include intravenous milrinone, 0.5 mcg/kg/min infusion titrated to effect, for refractory cases. Corticosteroids are contraindicated, as they worsen outcomes in RCVS, increasing complication rates by 25 percent. Non\u2010pharmacological measures include blood pressure control with labetalol infusions targeting mean arterial pressure of 80\u201390 mm Hg, avoidance of vasoactive triggers, and fluid management to maintain euvolemia. In cases with focal infarction or hemorrhage, neurosurgical interventions such as decompressive craniectomy have been reported in less than 2 percent of patients. Monitoring parameters include daily transcranial Doppler velocities and twice\u2010weekly CTA for the first two weeks. Special populations: in pregnancy, nimodipine doses may be reduced by 20 percent, and magnesium therapy is preferred; in renal impairment, nimodipine dosing should be cautiously adjusted with close monitoring of liver enzymes due to hepatic metabolism.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow\u2010up is recommended at one week, one month, three months, and six months after diagnosis. At each visit, headache severity is quantified on a numeric pain scale with target reduction to under two within four weeks. Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored to remain within age\u2010adjusted normal limits. Imaging surveillance with CTA or MR angiography is performed at one month and three months to confirm resolution of segmental vasoconstriction; normalization occurs in over 80 percent by week twelve. Laboratory screening for vasculitis is repeated only if clinical suspicion arises. Long\u2010term complications such as persistent headaches or cognitive changes occur in less than 10 percent at one year. Prognosis is favorable, with 95 percent of patients returning to baseline function by 12 months. Rehabilitation needs are minimal in most cases but may include physical therapy if focal neurologic deficits occurred. Patient education focuses on avoidance of vasoactive substances, recognition of thunderclap headache, and when to seek emergency care. Return to work or driving is permissible once headache episodes decrease to fewer than two per month and imaging is stable. Support resources include patient advocacy groups such as the RCVS Foundation and the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society for educational materials.","clinical_pearls":"1.

The classic \u201cstring-of-beads\u201d appearance reflects alternating constriction and dilation. RCVS is distinguished from aneurysm, AV malformation, and dissection by its reversibility (vasoconstriction resolves in 1\u20133 months), absence of a fixed structural lesion, and lack of a dissecting intimal flap. Aneurysms present as focal outpouchings without diffuse constriction; AV malformations show early venous filling; dissections show tapered stenosis and false lumen. Appropriate recognition of RCVS guides management toward removal of triggers and use of calcium channel blockers rather than invasive interventions.","source_file":"Part II 2018_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","import_source":"vascular_neurology_stroke_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient developed an embolic stroke, and his routine workup is unremarkable. What should be done next?","options":["Prolonged cardiac monitoring","Immediate surgery","Start anticoagulation","Discharge the patient"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Prolonged cardiac monitoring","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Prolonged cardiac monitoring. In a patient with an embolic-appearing stroke and an unremarkable initial workup (including normal carotid imaging and transthoracic echocardiography), prolonged ambulatory cardiac monitoring (e.g., 30-day event recorder or implantable loop recorder) is indicated to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is often occult on short-duration ECGs. Randomized trials such as CRYSTAL AF (N Engl J Med 2014;370:2478\u20132486) demonstrated that implantable monitoring increases atrial fibrillation detection rates to >12% at 12 months vs. <3% with standard follow-up (hazard ratio 4.6, 95% CI 2.1\u201310.0, p<0.001). Options B and D (immediate surgery or discharge) are inappropriate without identifying a treatable underlying source; option C (start anticoagulation) risks hemorrhage without confirmed cardioembolic source or high-risk lesion.","conceptual_foundation":"Cryptogenic stroke refers to ischemic stroke without an identifiable cause after standard vascular, cardiac, and hypercoagulability evaluations. Current classification systems (e.g., TOAST) categorize this as stroke of undetermined source. Occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is responsible for up to 30% of so-called cryptogenic strokes. Ambulatory monitoring captures infrequent arrhythmias missed on routine ECG or inpatient telemetry. Implantable loop recorders provide continuous monitoring for years, dramatically improving detection rates compared to 24\u201348 hour Holter monitors.","pathophysiology":"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation leads to stasis and thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage. These thrombi dislodge and embolize to cerebral arteries, producing ischemic infarction. In the absence of persistent arrhythmia on initial ECGs, intermittent episodes still confer similar stroke risk. Continuous monitoring restores detection of transient AF episodes, enabling targeted anticoagulation to prevent recurrence.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with sudden focal neurologic deficits. Cryptogenic strokes show no clear carotid or major cardiac source on initial workup. Recurrent embolic strokes are common if AF remains undetected. Detection of AF episodes as brief as >30 seconds has been associated with a twofold increase in recurrent stroke risk.","diagnostic_approach":"After non\u2010invasive imaging (MRI/CT head, CTA or carotid ultrasound) and cardiac evaluation (ECG, TTE), extended cardiac monitoring is the next step. Options include 30-day external monitors or implantable loop recorders. The choice depends on patient risk factors and resource availability. Professional guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018) give a Class I recommendation for prolonged rhythm monitoring in cryptogenic stroke.","management_principles":"If atrial fibrillation is detected, anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or warfarin reduces recurrent stroke risk by approximately 60% versus antiplatelets (HR ~0.40, 95% CI 0.30\u20130.55). DOACs are preferred (Class I, Level A evidence). No anticoagulation without documented AF or other high-risk cardioembolic source.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients with negative long\u2010term monitoring still require routine clinical follow\u2010up every 3\u20136 months, repeat of noninvasive monitors if suspicion remains high, and aggressive management of vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking).","clinical_pearls":"1. Up to one third of cryptogenic strokes are due to occult AF. 2. Implantable loop recorders detect AF earlier than 30-day monitors. 3. Detection of AF >30 seconds meets criteria for anticoagulation. 4. DOACs reduce stroke risk by >50% vs. aspirin in AF. 5. Early prolonged monitoring is cost-effective by preventing recurrent strokes.","references":"1. Sanna T et al. N Engl J Med. 2014;370(26):2478\u20132486. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1313600 2. Hart RG et al.
