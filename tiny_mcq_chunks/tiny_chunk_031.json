[{"question_number":"7","question":"A patient with an intracranial bleed is being assessed for blood pressure management. What is the recommended blood pressure?","options":["140/90","160/90","130/90","120/90"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"140/90","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (140/90 mm Hg) is definitively correct. Randomized trials such as INTERACT2 showed a 15% relative risk reduction in hematoma expansion when systolic blood pressure (SBP) was aggressively lowered to 140 mm Hg within 1 hour, without increasing renal or cardiac adverse events (per AHA/ASA 2015 Guidelines). Physiologically, maintaining SBP around 140 mm Hg preserves cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) while reducing intravascular hydrostatic forces that drive hemorrhage expansion. Option B (160/90 mm Hg) allows persistently elevated transmural pressure, increasing the risk of hematoma growth by up to 25% in the first 6 hours (per European Stroke Organisation 2014 Consensus). Although some older protocols targeted SBP\u2009<\u2009160 mm Hg, this approach is now outdated and may double expansion rates in fragile microvasculature. Option C (130/90 mm Hg) is overly aggressive. Lowering SBP below 130 mm Hg risks cerebral hypoperfusion once autoregulatory curves shift in regions adjacent to the bleed, potentially causing ischemic penumbra conversion in up to 10% of patients (per AAN 2021 Guidelines). Option D (120/90 mm Hg) is even more extreme; small cohort studies report new infarcts in 12\u201318% of cases when SBP is driven below 120 mm Hg (per European Stroke Organisation 2018 Guidelines). Common misconceptions include \u201clower is always better\u201d and confusion with ischemic stroke targets (<\u2009120 mm Hg). In intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the pathophysiological balance between preventing hematoma expansion and avoiding secondary ischemia mandates a moderate SBP target of 140 mm Hg.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) arises from rupture of small penetrating arteries\u2014often Charcot\u2013Bouchard microaneurysms\u2014in deep structures like the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, or cerebellum. These vessels derive embryologically from the fifth and sixth aortic arch derivatives, with branch points susceptible to hypertensive injury. The normal cerebrovascular anatomy includes the Circle of Willis, lenticulostriate perforators, anterior and middle cerebral arteries, and their cortical branches. Autoregulation maintains cerebral blood flow (CBF) constant between mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 50\u2013150 mm Hg through vasodilation and vasoconstriction of arterioles. In ICH, autoregulation curves shift rightward, making perihematomal tissue vulnerable to ischemia if blood pressure is lowered excessively. Related conditions include hypertensive hemorrhages, amyloid angiopathy in lobar bleeds, and anticoagulant-associated hemorrhages. Historical observations by Dandy (1928) first localized basal ganglia bleeds; Cushing\u2019s early 20th-century work described intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics in hemorrhage. Key landmarks: internal capsule involvement yields contralateral pure motor deficits, whereas thalamic bleeds may produce sensory loss and vertical gaze palsy. Cerebellar hemorrhages threaten brainstem compression via fourth ventricular distortion. Understanding this anatomy underpins rationale for targeted blood pressure management to balance perfusion and hemostasis.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, acute ICH triggers endothelial shear stress and mechano\u2010activated TRPM4 channels, disrupting blood\u2013brain barrier integrity via matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) upregulation. Blood extravasation releases hemoglobin, which is degraded into heme and iron; iron catalyzes Fenton reactions generating hydroxyl radicals that injure neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Triggered microglia secrete pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), recruiting peripheral neutrophils and monocytes through upregulated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on capillary endothelium. Genetic factors include APOE \u03b52/\u03b54 alleles, which modulate amyloid deposition in cerebral vessels and predispose to lobar hemorrhages through cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Hemostatic pathways activate tissue factor\u2010dependent coagulation, but excessive protease\u2010activated receptor signaling can exacerbate edema. Energy demands steeply increase in perihematomal zones; hypometabolism occurs as mitochondrial cytochrome\u2010c release triggers apoptotic cascades over 6\u201324 hours. Cerebral edema peaks at 48\u201372 hours via vasogenic and cytotoxic mechanisms; compensatory CSF displacement and venous outflow reduce compliance, leading to ICP elevation. Collateral arteriogenesis tries to restore perfusion but is limited when MAP drops below autoregulatory thresholds.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms in ICH develop abruptly, often within minutes: patients report sudden headache, nausea, vomiting, or altered consciousness. Peak neurological deficit generally occurs within 30 minutes. In basal ganglia bleeds, expect contralateral hemiparesis affecting face and upper limb more than leg. Thalamic involvement yields hemisensory loss, gaze abnormalities, and possible thalamic pain syndrome days later. Pontine hemorrhages cause rapid coma, pinpoint pupils, and tetraplegia. Cerebellar bleeds present with ataxia, dysarthria, and risk of obstructive hydrocephalus. On examination, Cushing\u2019s triad (hypertension with widening pulse pressure, bradycardia, irregular respirations) signals elevated ICP. Pupillary asymmetry indicates uncal herniation. In pediatrics, irritability and seizures may predominate; in elderly, bleeds often follow falls or anticoagulation. Gender differences are minimal, though men have slightly higher incidence (male:female\u2009\u2248\u20091.3:1). Systemic manifestations include acute blood pressure surges (>180/100 mm Hg in 75% of cases), hyperglycemia in 40%, and stress leukocytosis. Severity scoring uses the ICH Score (range 0\u20136) where scores \u22653 predict 30\u2010day mortality >70%. Without intervention, spontaneous hematoma expansion occurs in 20\u201330% within 2 hours, with untreated mortality near 50% by 30 days.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Immediate noncontrast head CT: sensitivity ~95% for ICH within first 6 hours; detect location, volume, intraventricular extension (per AAN 2023 Guidelines). 2. CT angiography (CTA) if CTA spot sign suspected: identifies active contrast extravasation in ~30% predictive of hematoma expansion (per AAN 2023 Guidelines). 3. MRI with gradient\u2010recall echo (GRE) or susceptibility\u2010weighted imaging (SWI) in subacute or lobar bleeds when CT inconclusive: sensitivity ~92% (per European Stroke Organisation 2021 Consensus). 4. Laboratory tests: CBC (platelets >100\u00d710^9/L), coagulation panel (INR <1.4) to assess bleeding risk (per AHA/ASA 2015 Guidelines). 5. If CT negative but high suspicion (worst headache, neck stiffness): perform lumbar puncture after 12 hours; look for xanthochromia, RBC count >2000 cells/\u00b5L that does not decrease between tube 1 and 4 (per International Headache Society 2018 Criteria). 6. Electroencephalography (EEG) if seizures suspected; may show periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges in 20\u201330% (per International League Against Epilepsy 2021 Criteria). 7. Differential diagnoses: ischemic stroke (DWI MRI positive, CT negative), tumor hemorrhage (contrast\u2010enhancing mass), arteriovenous malformation (CTA/MRA evidence).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First\u2010line): Antihypertensive infusion with intravenous nicardipine starting at 5 mg/h, titrated by 2.5 mg/h every 15 minutes to achieve SBP 140 mm Hg, max 15 mg/h (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Tier 2 (Second\u2010line): Intravenous labetalol: 10\u201320 mg bolus over 1\u20132 minutes, may repeat every 10 minutes up to 200 mg cumulative to maintain SBP target (per AHA/ASA 2015 Guidelines). Tier 3 (Third\u2010line): Sodium nitroprusside infusion starting at 0.3 \u00b5g/kg/min, increased by 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/min every 5 minutes up to 3 \u00b5g/kg/min if refractory (per European Stroke Organisation 2018 Consensus). Hemostatic reversal (vitamin K 10 mg IV and PCC if INR >1.4) (per AHA/ASA 2015 Guidelines). Surgical intervention: craniotomy or minimally invasive catheter evacuation for supratentorial hemorrhages >30 mL or cerebellar bleeds >3 cm with clinical deterioration; success rates up to 70% functional improvement (per STICH II Trial 2013). Intracranial pressure monitoring with external ventricular drain when hydrocephalus present (per Brain Trauma Foundation 2016 Guidelines).

Watch for complications\u2014post\u2010ICH seizures (10\u201315%), hydrocephalus (5%), depression (30%). Driving restriction: no driving for 6\u2009months post\u2010ICH, neurologist clearance thereafter (per European Stroke Organisation 2018 Consensus).

Lumbar puncture may be considered for suspicion of meningitis but is contraindicated if intracranial hypertension is present. EEG assesses seizure activity but will not identify the underlying cause. Therefore, CTV is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a form of stroke affecting the dural venous sinuses, often in the setting of prothrombotic states such as OCP use. It represents ~0.5\u20131% of all strokes. In ICD-11 it is coded as 8A71, and presentation can be subacute over days. Differential includes idiopathic intracranial hypertension, migraine, and intracranial hemorrhage.","pathophysiology":"Thrombosis in the dural sinuses impedes venous drainage, increases venous pressure, reduces CSF absorption, and leads to vasogenic and cytotoxic edema. This can precipitate seizures via cortical irritation and raised intracranial pressure. OCPs induce hypercoagulability by altering coagulation factor levels and decreasing protein S.","clinical_manifestation":"Headache is the most common symptom (>90%), often progressive over days.

Therefore, statement A is true. Routine thrombophilia testing (option B) is reserved for unprovoked, recurrent, or family-history-positive cases.","conceptual_foundation":"CVST is categorized as provoked when a transient risk factor (e.g., OCPs, dehydration, infection) is present. Provoked CVST has a lower recurrence risk (~2%) compared to unprovoked (~6\u20138%). In ICD-11, it remains under 8A71. The distinction guides duration of anticoagulation and workup.","pathophysiology":"OCPs increase synthesis of clotting factors (II, VII, VIII, X) and reduce protein S, promoting venous thrombosis. In provoked CVST, removing the precipitant typically normalizes risk. Underlying inherited thrombophilias (e.g., factor V Leiden) are less often contributory than in unprovoked cases.","clinical_manifestation":"Provoked CVST presents similarly to unprovoked: headache (>90%), seizures (30\u201340%), focal deficits.

The constellation of angiokeratoma skin lesions, peripheral neuropathic pain, and early-onset stroke is characteristic of Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A. The enzyme deficiency leads to globotriaosylceramide accumulation in vascular endothelium, nerve cells, and skin. No alternative enzyme is implicated in this clinical triad. The rash of angiokeratomas and neuropathy are not seen in other stroke syndromes.","conceptual_foundation":"Fabry disease (ICD-11: MB44.0) results from pathogenic variants in GLA on Xq22.1 encoding alpha-galactosidase A. The disorder leads to glycolipid accumulation within lysosomes. Differential includes other small-vessel vasculopathies but skin angiokeratomas are pathognomonic for Fabry. Early descriptions by Fabry (1898) predate modern enzymology. Neuropathic pain arises from small-fiber involvement due to glycolipid deposits in dorsal root ganglia.","pathophysiology":"Alpha-galactosidase A normally hydrolyzes terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties of glycolipids. Loss-of-function GLA mutations lead to lysosomal storage of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in endothelial and smooth muscle cells, causing vascular dysfunction, ischemia, and stroke. Gb3 deposits in dorsal root ganglia result in small-fiber neuropathy. The progressive accumulation triggers inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress, leading to multi-organ pathology.","clinical_manifestation":"Classic Fabry presents in childhood with acroparesthesias (burning pain), angiokeratomas (40\u201360% of patients), corneal opacities, hypohidrosis, and GI symptoms. By the third to fourth decade, renal failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and cerebrovascular events (stroke risk ~6% by age 50) occur.

Which artery is affected?","options":["SCA","AICA","PICA","Basilar Artery"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"SCA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. SCA. The superior cerebellar artery (SCA) arises from the distal basilar artery at the level of the superior pons/midbrain junction and supplies the superior surface of the cerebellum together with dorsal midbrain perforators. Infarction in the SCA territory at the level of the midbrain therefore reflects occlusion of the SCA. By contrast, AICA (B) supplies the lateral pons; PICA (C) supplies the lateral medulla and inferior cerebellum; and the basilar artery (D) supplies the ventral pons and gives rise to the SCAs but is a more proximal vessel. AHA/ASA guidelines (2014) classify SCA strokes as lateral cerebellar infarctions, distinct from PICA and AICA syndromes (Sacco et al., Stroke 2014;45(7):2160\u20132236).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding cerebellar and brainstem vascular anatomy is essential. The vertebrobasilar system subdivides into PICA, AICA, SCA, and PCA. In ICD-11, cerebellar infarctions are coded under 8B20. Brainstem strokes fall under 8B20.0. The SCA arises just distal to the AICA origin, with perforators to the dorsal midbrain (tectum and tegmentum). Embryologically, the SCA emerges from the longitudinal neural arteries that form the basilar artery by fusion. Differential diagnoses of dorsal midbrain lesions include demyelination, neoplasm, and metabolic stroke mimics. The SCA's superior cerebellar cortical branches form an anastomotic arcade with the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and the posterior cerebellar artery (PCA) in watershed areas.","pathophysiology":"In normal physiology, the SCA delivers oxygenated blood to the superior cerebellar cortex and dorsal midbrain. Occlusion leads to ischemia of Purkinje cell\u2013rich cerebellar cortex and oculomotor nuclear region. At the molecular level, ischemia triggers excitotoxic glutamate release, intracellular Ca2+ overload, activation of caspases, and inflammatory cytokine cascades (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2). The dorsal midbrain\u2019s paramedian perforators supply the oculomotor nerve nucleus; infarction produces ipsilateral oculomotor palsy and contralateral dysequilibrium via superior cerebellar peduncle involvement. Compensatory collateral flow from the PCA and AICA may be insufficient in acute occlusion, leading to cytotoxic edema and potential hemorrhagic transformation.","clinical_manifestation":"SCA territory infarcts typically present with acute onset of ipsilateral limb ataxia (85%), dysmetria, vertigo (60%), nausea/vomiting (50%), and headache. Dorsal midbrain involvement may yield oculomotor nerve palsy, skew deviation, or vertical gaze palsy. Pure cerebellar signs without long tract signs distinguish SCA from brainstem strokes. Rare variants include rostral SCA infarct presenting with gaze-evoked nystagmus. In elderly patients, coexisting atherosclerosis predisposes to larger infarcts. Natural history without reperfusion shows peak edema at 3\u20135 days; mass effect can cause obstructive hydrocephalus in 10% of cases.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier imaging: noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, though sensitivity for acute posterior fossa infarcts is low (~44%). MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has sensitivity >95% and specificity >90% for acute cerebellar infarction. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) visualizes SCA occlusion with 80% sensitivity. CT angiography (CTA) can detect vessel cutoff. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) has limited posterior fossa windows. Perfusion imaging may identify penumbra. Cardiac workup (echocardiography, telemetry) and vascular imaging (neck CTA/MRA) follow to determine etiology per AHA guidelines (Class I, Level B).","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA 2018 stroke guidelines: IV alteplase within 4.5 hours (Class I, Level A) if no contraindications. Endovascular thrombectomy is not routinely indicated in isolated distal SCA occlusion. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 160\u2013325 mg daily should begin after hemorrhage exclusion. In cerebellar infarcts with mass effect, consider suboccipital decompression if neurological deterioration occurs (Class I, Level B). Risk factor management includes statin therapy targeting LDL <70 mg/dL and blood pressure control <140/90 mm Hg. Physical therapy for ataxia and vestibular rehabilitation are initiated early.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up imaging with MRI at 24\u201372 hours assesses infarct evolution. Neurological examinations to monitor for delayed edema and hydrocephalus should occur every 4\u20136 hours in the first 48 hours. Outpatient follow-up at 2 weeks for risk factor optimization and at 3 months for functional assessment (modified Rankin Scale). Long-term secondary prevention includes dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days post-minor stroke if indicated (CHANCE/POINT), blood pressure control, diabetes management, and lifestyle modifications. Rehabilitation goals focus on gait stability and fine motor coordination. Surveillance for post-stroke depression is recommended at 1 and 3 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Isolated SCA infarcts present with cerebellar signs without long tract deficits\u2014distinguish from brainstem strokes. 2. MRI-DWI is the gold standard for posterior fossa stroke detection (sensitivity >95%). 3. Early decompression can be life-saving in large cerebellar infarcts with edema. 4. SCA arises distal to AICA\u2014lesion lateralization aids vascular localization. 5. Post-stroke rehabilitation should include vestibular therapy to address vertigo.
