In skeletal muscle channelopathies such as periodic paralysis and some non\u00addystrophic myotonias, the long exercise test (measuring CMAP amplitude over 5\u201310 minutes of exercise and recovery) is more sensitive for detecting abnormal decrement patterns than the short exercise test.

In one prospective cohort (Rajabally et al. 2015), proximal conduction block manifested as prolonged F\u2010wave latency in 78% of patients within seven days of onset. H\u2010reflex absence is similarly sensitive for S1 root involvement by demyelination in 70\u201385% early (van der Mech\u00e9 et al. 1992). This is pathognomonic of proximal root demyelination and distinguishes AIDP from axonal variants. Common misconception: believing that distal latencies (Option B) change first. In fact, distal metrics often remain normal until later. \n\nOption B: Decreased distal latency is incorrect\u2014distal motor latencies in AIDP are prolonged, not shortened, reflecting slowed conduction. Decreased latency might be seen in hyperexcitable conditions such as neuromyotonia (Isaacs\u2019 syndrome) where Isaacs\u2019 antibodies increase nodal Na+ channel activity (Shillito et al. 2014). It is not a feature of demyelination. \n\nOption C: Increased sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) amplitude is incorrect; SNAP amplitudes are typically reduced by demyelination (EFNS/PNS 2021). Increased amplitudes are never observed in demyelinating neuropathies; hyperpathic small\u2010fiber syndromes may show normal or slightly increased thermal thresholds but not SNAPs. \n\nOption D: Normal findings may occur in the first 24\u201348 hours, but studies show that F\u2010wave abnormalities emerge by day 3\u20135 in 65% of patients (Hadden et al. 1998). Normal NCS beyond 72 hours is rare. Misconception arises from early testing too soon. \n\nPathophysiological Rationale: In AIDP, immune\u2010mediated demyelination begins in proximal nerve roots where the blood\u2013nerve barrier is weakest, impairing conduction in proximal segments first. F waves and H reflexes test proximal segments; their absence or prolongation directly reflects early root demyelination (AAN 2023).","conceptual_foundation":"The anatomical substrate of AIDP centers on peripheral myelinated axons, specifically ventral and dorsal nerve roots that arise from spinal cord segments C5 to L5. Each root comprises Schwann cell\u2010ensheathed axons projecting from motor anterior horn cells and sensory dorsal root ganglia. The blood\u2013nerve barrier at root entry zones is embryologically formed from neural crest\u2010derived Schwann cell precursors that migrate along newly formed axons by week 8 of gestation; this barrier remains relatively permeable compared to endoneurial capillaries in distal nerves, predisposing roots to immune attack. Normally, nodes of Ranvier in myelinated fibers permit saltatory conduction, with Na+ channels concentrated at nodes and K+ channels in paranodal regions, optimizing conduction velocity at 50\u201360 m/s in healthy adults. The dorsal columns and ascending spinothalamic tracts transmit afferent signals centrally, while the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts carry efferent signals from cortical pyramidal neurons. AIDP selectively targets the peripheral myelin sheath, sparing central white matter. Early work by Guillain, Barr\u00e9, and Strohl (1916) described ascending paralysis linked to demyelination after antecendent Campylobacter jejuni infection. Key landmarks: the dorsal root entry zone at the spinal cord\u2013nerve root transition, where antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) on resident macrophages initiates complement\u2010mediated myelin damage. The anatomical arrangement of rootlets and impermeable endoneurium distally explains why proximal conduction tests detect abnormalities earliest.","pathophysiology":"AIDP is mediated by complement\u2010dependent antibody and T\u2010cell attacks on peripheral myelin glycoproteins (P0, P1, PMP22). Molecular mimicry following Campylobacter jejuni infection induces anti\u2010GM1 IgG in 30\u201340% of cases (Yuki et al. 2012). Binding of autoantibodies to nodal and paranodal proteins activates complement cascade (C5b\u20139 membrane attack complex), leading to Schwann cell injury and demyelination. Proinflammatory cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106) recruit macrophages across the weakened blood\u2013nerve barrier in roots, releasing nitric oxide and proteolytic enzymes, causing segmental demyelination. Ion channel redistribution at nodes results in conduction block and temporal dispersion. Energy\u2010dependent Na+/K+ ATPase pumps fail within two days of demyelination, compromising action potential propagation. Genetic predisposition involves HLA\u2010DRB1*15 and ICAM\u20101 polymorphisms (Odds ratio 1.4\u20131.8) that affect antigen presentation. The time course: immune activation peaks 7\u201314 days post\u2010infection; clinical nadir at 2\u20133 weeks. Compensatory remyelination by Schwann cells begins at about 4 weeks, but internodal lengths remain shorter, explaining late temporal dispersion on EMG. Recovery involves collateral sprouting and node reorganization over months.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms typically begin 1\u20133 weeks after a triggering event. Day 1\u20137: Tingling in toes and fingers. Day 3\u201314: Ascending symmetric weakness\u2014ankle dorsiflexion MRC grade 4\u21922 within 5 days. Deep tendon reflexes become hypoactive or absent in 95% by day 7. Peak weakness (MRC sum score <24/60) occurs at median of two weeks. Cranial nerves (facial diplegia) are involved in 50%. Autonomic dysfunction (labile blood pressure, arrhythmias) occurs in 65% and can be life\u2010threatening. Respiratory failure requiring intubation develops in 25% of adults; pediatric rates are slightly lower at 15%. Elderly patients have slower recovery and higher morbidity. Females may have slightly higher incidence of sensory variants. Associated systemic features: mild fever from preceding infection, gastrointestinal symptoms in 30%. Severity scales: Erasmus GBS Outcome Score (EGOS) predicts inability to walk unaided at 6 months; mEGOS uses age, preceding diarrhoea, and GBS Disability Scale. Red flags suggesting alternative diagnosis include hyperreflexia or asymmetric onset. Without treatment, mortality is 5%\u201310% due to respiratory failure or autonomic crisis.
