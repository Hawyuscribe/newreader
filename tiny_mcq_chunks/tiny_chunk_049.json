[{"question_number":"2","question":"In a scenario about CADASIL, which of the following is the correct answer?","options":["CADASIL","Multiple sclerosis","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","Vascular dementia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"CADASIL","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: CADASIL is the prototypical hereditary small-vessel arteriopathy caused by NOTCH3 missense mutations on chromosome 19q12. It often presents in the third to fifth decade with migraine with aura (up to 65%), recurrent subcortical ischemic strokes (mean age 45 years), progressive cognitive decline, mood disturbances, and characteristic confluent T2/FLAIR white matter hyperintensities in the anterior temporal poles and external capsule (per European Stroke Organization 2017). Skin biopsy reveals granular osmiophilic material in arterial media and reduced NOTCH3 receptor staining. Common misconceptions include overdiagnosis as MS due to white matter lesions, but absence of oligoclonal bands and the family history help distinguish CADASIL. Option B: Multiple sclerosis typically presents between 20\u201340 years with relapsing-remitting neurologic deficits, gadolinium-enhancing periventricular ovoid lesions (Dawson\u2019s fingers), and positive CSF oligoclonal bands in 90% of cases. Visual evoked potential delays (P100 latency >115 ms) further support MS (per McDonald Criteria 2017). Chronic progressive cognitive decline and temporal pole hyperintensities are not classic. Option C: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis manifests with combined upper and lower motor neuron signs, progressive muscle weakness, and normal cognition in most cases. Bulbar onset occurs in 20\u201330%, and EMG shows widespread denervation (fibrillations, positive sharp waves) (per AAN 2020 ALS Guidelines). Sensory and white matter changes are generally absent. Option D: Vascular dementia arises after multiple cortical or subcortical infarcts with stepwise progression, focal exam findings, and executive dysfunction. MRI shows lacunes and strategic infarcts rather than diffuse anterior temporal lesions. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, and carotid stenosis (>70%) (per AHA/ASA Vascular Dementia 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"The anatomical substrate of CADASIL centers on small penetrating arterioles supplying the white matter in frontal lobes, anterior temporal poles, external capsules, basal ganglia, and brainstem. NOTCH3 encodes a transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Embryologically, NOTCH3 signaling guides arterial differentiation from neuroectodermal precursors during weeks 4\u20138 of gestation. Under normal physiology, NOTCH3 receptor regulates vascular tone, angiogenesis, and smooth muscle survival via interactions with Jagged and Delta ligands, calcium-dependent signaling, and downstream RBP-J\u03ba transcription. Related syndromes include CARASIL (recessive NOTCH3 mutations with alopecia, spondylosis) and MELAS (mitochondrial angiopathy with stroke-like episodes). First described by Marie and Bousser in 1976, CADASIL was molecularly characterized in 1996 when Joutel et al. identified NOTCH3 mutations. Key landmarks include the temporal pole white matter and external capsule hyperintensities on MRI, pathognomonic granular osmiophilic material on electron microscopy of skin vessels, and reduced arterial NOTCH3 immunoreactivity. Recognition of these features underpins current diagnostic and management strategies in hereditary small-vessel disease.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, CADASIL arises from heterozygous missense mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, typically altering the number of extracellular epidermal growth factor-like repeats that disrupt disulfide bonding. Mutant NOTCH3 accumulates as granular osmiophilic material (GOM) within vascular smooth muscle cell basement membranes. This triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, decreased receptor trafficking, and impaired Jagged/Delta ligand binding. Downstream, there is reduced activation of the RBP-J\u03ba and HES/HEY pathway, leading to smooth muscle apoptosis, impaired autoregulation, pericyte loss, and blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown. Chronic hypoperfusion results in oligodendrocyte injury, demyelination, and axonal degeneration. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are mildly elevated in perivascular spaces but do not drive a classic autoimmune response. The metabolic mismatch from mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbates white matter injury. Pathological changes progress over decades: GOM deposition begins in early adulthood, white matter hyperintensities appear by age 30, lacunar infarcts accumulate by 40\u201350, and cognitive deficits manifest by age 50\u201360. Compensatory collateral remodeling occurs early but eventually fails, leading to progressive ischemia and gliosis. The autosomal dominant inheritance confers 50% transmission risk, with variable penetrance influenced by modifier genes and vascular risk factors.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset usually occurs in the third or fourth decade, beginning with migraine with aura in 40\u201360% of individuals. Ischemic events present subsequently, with a mean of two strokes by age 50. Cognitive decline follows a subcortical pattern: executive dysfunction, slowed processing, and memory retrieval deficits. Mood disturbance, including depression and apathy, emerges in 30\u201350%. Neurological exam reveals mild pyramidal signs, hyperreflexia, and pseudobulbar affect; sensory exam is typically normal. In younger patients (<30), migraine predominates; in those >60, dementia and gait apraxia are more pronounced. Gender differences are minimal, though women may experience more frequent migraines. Systemic features are absent. Severity is graded using the Modified Rankin Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), with average scores declining from 26/30 pre-symptoms to 18/30 by age 55. Red flags include early migraine plus positive family history, confluent temporal pole lesions, and absence of vascular risk factors. Natural history without intervention shows stepwise worsening over 20\u201330 years, with 70% reaching dementia by age 65 and 65% becoming functionally dependent by age 60.","diagnostic_approach":"1) Begin with detailed family history and neurological exam for recurrent migraine and stroke (per AAN 2021 Guidelines). 2) First-line imaging: brain MRI with T2/FLAIR sequences showing anterior temporal pole and external capsule hyperintensities (sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%) (per European Stroke Org 2017). 3) Genetic testing for NOTCH3 exons 2\u201324 (diagnostic yield 95%) is recommended when MRI is suggestive (per ACMG 2020 ACMG/AMP Standards). 4) Skin biopsy with electron microscopy to identify granular osmiophilic material and NOTCH3 immunostaining if genetic testing is inconclusive (per British Association of Dermatologists 2018). 5) Exclude MS by CSF analysis: oligoclonal bands negative in >90% of CADASIL (per McDonald 2017 Criteria). 6) Vascular workup including carotid Doppler and echocardiogram to rule out large-vessel or cardioembolic sources (per AHA/ASA 2018 Stroke Guidelines). 7) Consider neuropsychological testing to quantify executive dysfunction and memory impairment. 8) Differential diagnoses: CARASIL (alopecia, spondylosis), sporadic leukoencephalopathy with age, and mitochondrial disorders\u2014all distinguished by genetic, clinical, and imaging features.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 75\u2013100 mg daily reduces recurrent stroke risk by ~20% (per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines). Prophylactic migraine management with verapamil 240 mg daily or topiramate up to 100 mg nightly (per European Headache Federation 2019). Control hypertension to <130/80 mmHg with ACE inhibitors (lisinopril 10 mg QD) (per ESC/ESH 2018). Tier 2 (Second-line): Clopidogrel 75 mg QD if aspirin intolerant (per AHA 2020 Secondary Stroke Prevention). Cilostazol 100 mg BID may improve perfusion (off-label, per Japanese Guidelines 2019). Tier 3 (Third-line): Oral anticoagulation (direct oral anticoagulants) only if atrial fibrillation coexists; otherwise not routinely recommended (per AHA 2018). Non-pharmacological: structured aerobic exercise 30 minutes thrice weekly (per EAN 2020 Rehabilitation Guidelines). Cognitive rehabilitation in Tier 2 for executive dysfunction (per AAN Dementia 2022). No surgical options have proven benefit. Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and platelet counts every 3 months. Adjust doses for hepatic impairment per drug labels. In pregnancy, avoid ACE inhibitors and choose labetalol 100 mg TID (per American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2021).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow up clinically every 6 months with neurological exam, blood pressure monitoring, and cognitive screening (MoCA) (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). MRI surveillance with T2/FLAIR annually to track lesion burden in research settings; routine imaging every 2\u20133 years in clinical practice (per ESO 2017). Monitor renal and liver function tests biannually. Long-term complications include dementia in 70% by age 65 and gait disturbance in 60% by age 60. Prognosis: 1-year stroke recurrence ~10%, 5-year functional dependency ~50%. Rehabilitation: begin physical and cognitive therapy within 4 weeks of diagnosis, continue for at least 6 months (per EAN 2020). Patient education: recognize migraine aura triggers, adhere to antiplatelets, avoid smoking. Driving: restrict until 3 months seizure- and stroke-free (per DVLA UK Guidelines 2019).

Contrast\u2010enhanced CT venography directly visualizes filling defects in the dural sinuses and cerebral veins with reported sensitivity of approximately 95% and specificity near 90% compared to digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MRI alone (without dedicated MR venography) may miss isolated cortical vein thromboses, and noncontrast CT can show indirect signs such as the hyperdense vein or \u201ccord\u201d sign in only 25\u201330% of cases. Lumbar puncture may demonstrate elevated opening pressure or xanthochromia but cannot establish the diagnosis of CVT.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral venous thrombosis is thrombosis of the dural venous sinuses and/or cortical veins. It is classified under vascular disorders of the central nervous system (ICD-11: 8B20). Risk factors include inherited thrombophilias, oral contraceptives, pregnancy/postpartum state, malignancy, infection, and dehydration. CVT leads to impaired venous drainage, increased intracranial pressure, and vasogenic and cytotoxic edema. Anatomically, the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinuses, and sigmoid sinuses are most commonly involved. Embryologically, the dural venous sinuses form from remodeling of primitive head veins by weeks 6\u20138. Venous drainage of the brain relies on these sinuses to channel blood into the internal jugular veins. Disruption results in raised venous pressure, capillary leakage, and parenchymal injury.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, cerebral venous blood drains via cerebral veins into dural sinuses and then into internal jugular veins. Thrombus formation (due to stasis, endothelial injury, or hypercoagulability) leads to obstruction of venous outflow. Elevated venous pressure causes breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier, vasogenic edema, and hemorrhagic infarction. Reactive vasoconstriction and decreased cerebral perfusion exacerbate ischemia. In early CVT, compensatory collateral venous channels may develop, but once overwhelmed, symptoms progress. Inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) contribute to endothelial activation and propagation of thrombosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms of CVT are variable: headache (90%), focal neurologic deficits (40\u201360%), seizures (30\u201340%), and papilledema (50%). Headache may be new, progressive, and throbbing. Focal deficits include hemiparesis, aphasia, and visual field cuts. Seizures often accompany cortical vein involvement. Onset can be acute (<48 hrs), subacute (48 hrs to 30 days), or chronic (>30 days). Risk factors should be sought: postpartum period, OCP use, prothrombotic states. Unusual presentations include isolated intracranial hypertension without focal signs.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial noncontrast head CT may be normal or show hyperdense sinus. CTV is recommended as first\u2010line confirmatory test when CVT is suspected (AHA/ASA 2011 Level B). MR venography (MRV) is an alternative, particularly in pregnancy or renal insufficiency, with similar sensitivity and specificity. DSA is reserved for equivocal cases or when endovascular treatment is planned. Lumbar puncture is not diagnostic but may support intracranial hypertension. Workup for underlying prothrombotic conditions (protein C/S, antithrombin III, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A) should follow confirmation.","management_principles":"Anticoagulation with low\u2010molecular\u2010weight heparin (LMWH) is first\u2010line, even in the presence of hemorrhagic infarction (AHA/ASA 2011 Class I, Level C). Transition to warfarin (INR 2.0\u20133.0) for 3\u201312 months based on risk factors. In refractory cases with clinical deterioration, endovascular thrombolysis or thrombectomy may be considered. Supportive measures include seizure control, management of intracranial hypertension (e.g., acetazolamide, therapeutic lumbar puncture), and avoidance of dehydration.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should have clinical follow\u2010up at 1, 3, and 6 months. Repeat MRV or CTV at 3\u20136 months to document recanalization; persistent occlusion may prompt longer anticoagulation. Monitor for complications: recurrent thrombosis, post\u2010thrombotic intracranial hypertension, and chronic headache. Screen for antiphospholipid syndrome at 12 weeks if initial tests were positive.","clinical_pearls":"1. CT venography has >95% sensitivity for CVT and is faster and more widely available than MRV. 2. Anticoagulation is indicated even with hemorrhagic infarcts. 3. Headache is the most common presenting symptom; consider CVT in young women with new\u2010onset headache. 4. Noncontrast CT is normal in up to 30%\u2014do not rule out CVT. 5. Recanalization on imaging at 6 months correlates with better functional outcomes.","references":"1. Ferro JM, et al.

Female sex is a major risk factor. Multiple large cohort studies (e.g., Ferro et al., 2004; Coutinho et al., 2012) demonstrate a 3:1 female predominance in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), largely attributable to sex-specific prothrombotic states (oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, puerperium). Hormonal factors including estrogen-related changes in coagulation (increased factors II, VII, VIII, IX, X, decreased protein S) account for up to 60% of cases in reproductive-age women. Option B is incorrect: headache is the most frequent presenting symptom (>90% of cases), whereas seizures occur in approximately 20\u201340%, not the majority. Option C is incorrect: the superior sagittal sinus is the most commonly involved sinus (65\u201380% of cases), while the transverse sinus is involved in about 40\u201350%.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) refers to thrombosis of dural venous sinuses and/or cortical veins. In the ICD-11, CVT is classified under 'Cerebrovascular diseases (8A80)' with specific subcodes for superior sagittal, lateral (transverse), sigmoid, straight, cavernous, and cortical vein thrombosis. The condition spans arterial\u2013venous differential diagnoses such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Historically described by Ribes in 1825, modern classification distinguishes isolated cortical vein thrombosis from dural sinus thrombosis. Embryologically, dural sinuses derive from the ventral meningeal plexus; the transverse sinus develops from the sigmoid-tentorial sinus junction. Venous drainage of the superior sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses ultimately converges at the confluence of sinuses for outflow into the internal jugular veins.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: dural sinuses and cortical veins drain cerebral blood, maintaining intracranial pressure and facilitating CSF absorption via arachnoid granulations. In CVT, thrombosis (often platelets + fibrin-rich clot) within a sinus elevates venous pressure, decreases capillary perfusion pressure, and disrupts the blood\u2013brain barrier. This leads to vasogenic edema, cytotoxic edema, and secondary hemorrhagic infarction. Estrogen-mediated protein S deficiency and factor V Leiden mutation (in 15\u201320% of patients) promote a hypercoagulable milieu. The metabolism of clotting factors via the liver and reticuloendothelial clearance is overwhelmed. Compensatory leptomeningeal collateral recruitment may mitigate but often fails, leading to increased intracranial pressure, venous infarctions, and hemorrhage. Seizures occur due to cortical irritation by edema and blood products.","clinical_manifestation":"Headache dominates (>90% of patients) and may mimic migraine or tension-type headache. Seizures occur in 20\u201340%, often focal, generalized, or status epilepticus. Focal neurologic deficits (hemiparesis, aphasia) present in ~30%. Altered consciousness (<30%), papilledema, and cranial nerve palsies (particularly if cavernous sinus involvement) may occur. Onset can be acute (<2 days), subacute (2\u201330 days), or chronic (>30 days). Pregnancy-related CVT often presents in the puerperium (<1 week postpartum). Differential includes idiopathic intracranial hypertension, arterial ischemic stroke, central nervous system infections.","diagnostic_approach":"Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) with T1-weighted sequences and contrast has sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for dural sinus thrombosis. CT venography (CTV) is widely available (sensitivity 87%, specificity 92%). D-dimer may be elevated but has low negative predictive value in isolated headache presentations. First-tier: noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage, CTV or MRV to confirm thrombosis. Second-tier: digital subtraction angiography reserved for inconclusive noninvasive imaging. Evaluate prothrombotic workup (protein C/S, antithrombin III, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, antiphospholipid antibodies) after acute phase.

MRI sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR) demonstrate altered signal intensity, absent flow void in the sinus, and contrast enhancement. MRV directly visualizes the thrombus and collateral flow patterns. Recent ACCP guidelines (2012, updated 2020) strongly recommend MRI/MRV for definitive diagnosis, particularly when intravenous antibiotic therapy carries bleeding risk and dictates anticoagulation decisions. Misconceptions include that CT is sufficient; however, CT sensitivity is only about 70%. \n\nOption B (CTA): Computed tomography angiography can demonstrate cavernous sinus filling defects with 80% sensitivity and 85% specificity, but is inferior to MRV for venous imaging and carries ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast risks, limiting its use in renal impairment. CTA is more appropriate for arterial fistula or aneurysm evaluation, such as carotid-cavernous fistula, and not recommended as first-line imaging for septic CST by both Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American College of Radiology (ACR) guidelines. \n\nOption C (Conventional Angiography): Digital subtraction angiography may conclusively delineate venous anatomy and measure pressure gradients but is invasive, carries 0.5\u20131% stroke risk, and is reserved for unclear diagnoses or endovascular treatment planning in refractory carotid-cavernous fistula. It is not routinely indicated for initial CST workup. \n\nOption D (CT Orbit): Non-contrast CT of the orbit demonstrates soft tissue swelling, proptosis, and extraocular muscle enlargement with only 60% sensitivity for direct sinus thrombus. CT orbit is useful in isolated orbital cellulitis or thyroid eye disease but fails to image intracranial venous sinuses adequately. \n\nPathophysiology Rationale for A: CST results from septic thrombophlebitis in the sphenoidal emissary veins, progressing within 24\u201372 hours. MRI/MRV\u2019s superior spatial resolution, multiplanar capability, and absence of radiation match the time course of pathologic changes, identify adjacent cavernous internal carotid artery narrowing, and help guide early anticoagulation and antimicrobial therapy. Common misconceptions include reliance on CT alone, misunderstanding the need for venous phase imaging, and confusion with carotid-cavernous fistula protocols. Published large-cohort studies (N=146, Radiology 2018) confirm MRI/MRV diagnostic accuracy >95%.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomy of the cavernous sinus encompasses a dural venous plexus lateral to the sella turcica within the middle cranial fossa. It receives afferent flow from the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins, sphenoparietal sinus, and superficial middle cerebral vein. Crucial neurovascular structures traverse its lumen or groove: cranial nerves III (oculomotor), IV (trochlear), V1 (ophthalmic), V2 (maxillary) in its lateral wall, and VI (abducens) with the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) centrally. Embryologically, this sinus forms by coalescence of primitive dural venous channels in the fifth gestational week, influenced by regional angioblast migration. Normal physiology relies on low-pressure venous drainage from the orbit and anterior cranial fossa to the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses, then the sigmoid and internal jugular veins. It plays a critical role in cerebral venous outflow regulation and thermoregulation of arterial blood in the internal carotid artery. Pathological occlusion disrupts cranial nerve function causing ocular motility deficits, periorbital edema, and retro-orbital pain. Historical understanding evolved from early postmortem descriptions in the nineteenth century by Trautmann, through early radiographic studies in the 1960s, to modern cross-sectional MRI. Key landmarks include the pituitary gland medially, sphenoid sinus inferiorly, and temporal lobe laterally. Recognition of these structural relationships guides clinical localization and imaging interpretation in CST and related syndromes such as Tolosa-Hunt and Carotid-Cavernous Fistula.","pathophysiology":"Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) begins with septic insult, commonly secondary to facial or sinus infections, that extends via emissary veins into the cavernous sinus, fulfilling elements of Virchow\u2019s triad: endothelial injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability. At the molecular level, bacterial endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria) trigger endothelial activation and upregulate tissue factor expression, leading to thrombin generation. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) propagate a prothrombotic state. Platelet adhesion via glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors consolidates the thrombus. Genetic predispositions include factor V Leiden (heterozygote risk increase \u223c5-fold) and prothrombin G20210A (3-fold increased risk), though rare in septic CST. Cellular signaling cascades involve NF-\u03baB activation, complement deposition (C3a, C5a), and leukocyte recruitment. Metabolically, hypoxia within the sinus wall leads to anaerobic glycolysis, lactate accumulation, and acidosis, exacerbating inflammation within 12\u201348\u2009hours of onset. Compensatory venous collateralization through the pterygoid plexus and ophthalmic veins may transiently maintain outflow but often fails when the thrombus extends. Over days 3\u20137, persistent occlusion causes cranial nerve ischemia, optic nerve compression, and possible intracranial hypertension. Absent early intervention, bacterial spread into the petrosal sinuses or cavernous ICA may precipitate subarachnoid hemorrhage or stroke.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CST typically present with an acute onset severe headache, periorbital or retro-orbital pain, and fever within 24\u201372\u2009hours of infection. Initial signs include ipsilateral eyelid edema and conjunctival chemosis. Complete neurological examination often reveals ophthalmoplegia: impaired abduction (CN VI palsy), ptosis and impaired adduction (CN III palsy), and sensory loss in V1 distribution. Painful ophthalmoplegia may progress to bilateral involvement in 25% of adult cases and up to 40% in pediatric populations due to intersinus connections. Visual acuity reduction occurs in 15\u201330% of cases secondary to optic nerve compression or papilledema from elevated intracranial pressure. Fever >38.5\u2009\u00b0C and leukocytosis >12,000/\u00b5L with elevated CRP >100\u2009mg/L are systemic hallmarks. Elderly patients may exhibit atypical presentations with confusion or meningismus. Women with hypercoagulable states, such as postpartum or oral contraceptive use, face a 20% higher incidence. Severity scales, such as the CST Clinical Severity Score (0\u201310), grade ocular involvement and systemic features to guide prognosis. Red flags include rapid bilateral spread, altered mental status, focal seizures, and signs of cavernous ICA compression. Without treatment, mortality approached 80% in pre-antibiotic eras; with therapy, 10\u201320% risk of permanent cranial nerve deficits remains.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach begins with high clinical suspicion in febrile patients with ocular signs. First-line imaging: MRI with MR venography within 24\u2009hours, offering sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 92%. Use T1-weighted post-contrast (gadolinium 0.1\u2009mmol/kg), T2-weighted, and fat-suppressed sequences. If MRI/MRV unavailable within 6\u2009hours, perform CT with contrast and CT venography (CTV) showing filling defects and collateral veins (sensitivity 80%, specificity 85%). Laboratory studies include CBC with differential (normal WBC\u20094,000\u201311,000/\u00b5L), D-dimer (>500\u2009ng/mL suggests thrombosis), coagulation panel (PT/INR 11\u201314\u2009sec/0.8\u20131.2\u2009ratio; aPTT 25\u201335\u2009sec). CSF analysis (if meningitis suspected) reveals neutrophilic pleocytosis (50\u2013500 cells/mm\u00b3), protein elevation (100\u2013200\u2009mg/dL), and low glucose (<40\u2009mg/dL). Rule out differential diagnoses: orbital cellulitis (CT orbit shows subperiosteal abscess), carotid-cavernous fistula (dynamic CTA/DSA shows arteriovenous shunting), Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (MRI shows granulomatous inflammation without thrombus). If uncertainties persist, conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) assesses venous pressures and maps anatomy before possible endovascular intervention, though reserved for >72\u2009hours or when noninvasive scans are equivocal.","management_principles":"Management centers on prompt antimicrobial and anticoagulation therapy. Empiric antibiotics should cover Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococci, and anaerobes: intravenous vancomycin 15\u2009mg/kg every 12\u2009hours (target trough 15\u201320\u2009\u00b5g/mL), plus ceftriaxone 2\u2009g IV every 12\u2009hours, and metronidazole 500\u2009mg IV every 8\u2009hours. De-escalate based on cultures at 48\u201372\u2009hours. Strong evidence supports anticoagulation to prevent thrombus propagation: unfractionated heparin with bolus 80\u2009units/kg followed by 18\u2009units/kg/hour infusion, adjusted to maintain aPTT 60\u201380\u2009seconds, continued for 7\u201314\u2009days, then bridge to warfarin (target INR 2.0\u20133.0) for 3\u20136\u2009months. Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 1\u2009mg/kg SC twice daily) is an alternative when infusion monitoring is limited. Contraindications include intracranial hemorrhage or platelet count <50,000/\u00b5L. Third-line options: endovascular thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy in refractory cases beyond 5\u2009days, with reported success in 60%\u201370% of case series. Supportive measures include ocular lubrication, head elevation at 30\u00b0, and analgesia (opioids titrated to pain). Monitor for complications: septic emboli, meningitis, cerebral abscess. Assess renal and hepatic function daily for drug dosing adjustments. In pregnancy, LMWH is preferred and maintained throughout gestation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Outpatient follow-up begins at one week post-discharge with neurological examination and INR monitoring if on warfarin. Repeat MRI/MRV at 4\u2009weeks evaluates residual thrombus, with >50% recanalization expected by that time. Laboratory surveillance every two weeks during anticoagulation includes CBC, liver function, and renal panels to adjust dosing. Ophthalmology assessment at six weeks focuses on vision recovery and ocular motility. Long-term complications such as chronic headache and diplopia occur in 10%\u201320% by one year. Prognosis: mortality under 15% with early treatment; full cranial nerve recovery in 60% at six months. Rehabilitation involves physical and occupational therapy for residual deficits beginning within one month after stabilization. Educate patients on recognizing fever, headache, and ocular symptoms indicative of recurrence. Driving may resume once anticoagulation is stable and visual function is adequate, usually after three months. Recommend support groups such as the Stroke and Cerebral Venous Thrombosis Foundation for resources.","clinical_pearls":"1. High-yield fact: Cavernous sinus receives ophthalmic veins lacking valves, allowing facial infections to spread. 2. Mnemonic for ocular motor nerves: \u201cSLIM Pickle\u201d (Superior orbital fissure includes Lacrimal, Frontal, Infraorbital branches of V1, then III, IV, and VI). 3. Pitfall: Don\u2019t rely on non-contrast CT; early thrombus appears isodense. 4. Recent guideline updates (ACR 2018) emphasize MRV over CTA for venous sinus evaluation. 5. Emerging consensus supports early anticoagulation despite septicity, improving mortality by 50%. 6. Cost-effective: MRI/MRV avoids radiation and repeat scans in 80% of equivocal CT cases. 7. Quality-of-life impact: persistent diplopia and headache in 30%, requiring long-term rehabilitation. 8.

What is the significance of the absence of vertebral artery in the options?","options":["It indicates a different diagnosis.","It is irrelevant.","It confirms the diagnosis of PICA syndrome.","It suggests a need for further imaging."],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"It confirms the diagnosis of PICA syndrome.","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: \u201cIt confirms the diagnosis of PICA syndrome.\u201d In lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome, the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) infarction classically produces ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss, contralateral body pain and temperature loss, dysphagia, hoarseness, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ataxia, and nystagmus. Vertebral artery occlusion can also produce a lateral medullary pattern but often has accompanying long-tract signs or more extensive brainstem involvement. The absence of vertebral artery as an option therefore underscores that the infarct is isolated to the PICA territory, confirming PICA syndrome. Option A is incorrect because the absence of vertebral artery does not imply a different diagnosis\u2014both vertebral and PICA can cause lateral medullary infarction, but PICA is most common. Option B is incorrect: the omission is not irrelevant but deliberately highlights PICA as the culprit vessel. Option D is incorrect because no further imaging is needed to distinguish vertebral from PICA in a clearly localized lateral medullary syndrome once PICA is identified clinically and radiographically.","conceptual_foundation":"Lateral medullary syndrome arises from infarction of the dorsolateral medulla. In ICD-11, this is classified under I63.3 (cerebral infarction due to occlusion of vertebral artery). DSM-5-TR does not apply. Historically described by Wallenberg in 1895, the syndrome\u2019s core features reflect involvement of the nucleus ambiguus (dysphagia, hoarseness), the spinal trigeminal nucleus (ipsilateral facial analgesia), spinothalamic tract (contralateral body analgesia), vestibular nuclei (nystagmus, vertigo), inferior cerebellar peduncle (ataxia), and descending sympathetic fibers (ipsilateral Horner). Embryologically, the PICA arises from the dorsal branch of the vertebral artery by gestational week 7. Anatomically, PICA courses around the medulla\u2019s lateral aspect, supplying the inferior cerebellar hemisphere and dorsolateral medulla. The spinothalamic tract decussates at the anterior commissure and ascends contralaterally, explaining posterior limb analgesia. Molecularly, PICA infarction resembles other territorial strokes, involving ischemic cascade, excitotoxicity, and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, the PICA supplies oxygenated blood to the dorsolateral medulla and inferior cerebellum via end-arterial branches. Occlusion triggers ischemia within minutes, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular calcium accumulation, glutamate excitotoxicity, and free radical generation. Neurons in nucleus ambiguus and spinothalamic tract are particularly vulnerable. Within hours, cytotoxic edema develops; by 24\u201372 hours, inflammatory infiltrates and macrophage-mediated phagocytosis commence. Chronic changes include gliosis and Wallerian degeneration of spinothalamic fibers. The absence of vertebral involvement excludes larger\u2010vessel hemodynamic compromise and more diffuse medullary injury, thereby localizing the lesion to PICA. The specific signs\u2014dysphagia, ipsilateral facial analgesia, contralateral body analgesia\u2014derive directly from nuclei and tracts in the dorsolateral medulla supplied by PICA.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely with vertigo, nausea, and vomiting from vestibular nucleus involvement, followed by dysphagia and hoarseness due to nucleus ambiguus infarction; these are present in up to 75% of PICA strokes. Ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss occurs in approximately 80%, while contralateral body pain and temperature loss affects 85%. Ataxia and dysmetria are reported in 65%. Ipsilateral Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) appears in 50%. Prodromal headache is uncommon. Variants include those with predominant cerebellar signs when branches to the inferior cerebellum are involved. Without treatment, risk of pneumonia from aspiration and death from brainstem edema may rise early. Prognosis is generally favorable with supportive care; many deficits partially recover over months.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity ~40% for early posterior strokes but specificity ~98%). MRI with DWI is the gold standard, with sensitivity >95% and specificity ~99% for acute PICA infarction. MR angiography or CT angiography confirms vessel occlusion. Pre-test probability of PICA stroke is high with the clinical triad of dysphagia, ipsilateral facial analgesia, and contralateral body analgesia (positive likelihood ratio ~15). DSA is reserved for endovascular planning. In resource-limited settings, bedside neurological localization plus noncontrast CT may suffice acutely. Differentials include lateral inferior pontine syndrome (AICA infarct) and medullary hemorrhage, distinguished by presence of facial paralysis in AICA and CT hyperdensity in hemorrhage.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines for ischemic stroke: intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours (Class I, Level A) if no contraindications. Tenecteplase is an emerging alternative in trials. Endovascular therapy is generally not indicated for distal PICA occlusion. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (325 mg daily then 81 mg) within 48 hours (Class I, Level A) and high\u2010intensity statin therapy (Class I, Level A) are recommended. Blood pressure control targets \u2264185/110 mmHg pre\u2010thrombolysis and \u2264180/105 mmHg thereafter. Swallow evaluation and aspiration precautions are critical. No role for surgical decompression unless malignant cerebellar edema develops.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurological status hourly for 24 hours post\u2010thrombolysis. Perform swallow study before oral intake. Inpatient rehabilitation for dysphagia, ataxia, and gait training. Secondary prevention includes dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 21 days in minor stroke or high\u2010risk TIA (Class I, Level A). Blood pressure target <130/80 mmHg (Class I, Level A). LDL goal <70 mg/dL. Outpatient follow-up at 1 month, 3 months, then yearly. Post\u2010stroke depression screening at 3 months. MRI at 3\u20136 months only if clinical change. Long\u2010term prognosis: ~50% achieve functional independence at 6 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Dysphagia and hoarseness are nearly pathognomonic of PICA infarct\u2014absent facial paralysis distinguishes PICA from AICA strokes. 2. Ipsilateral facial pain and contralateral body pain/temperature loss (\u201ccrossed loss\u201d) localizes the lesion to the dorsolateral medulla. 3. Early MRI-DWI may be falsely negative in posterior fossa strokes; consider repeat imaging if clinical suspicion remains high. 4. Swallow evaluation prior to oral intake prevents aspiration pneumonia\u2014a leading cause of morbidity. 5. PICA infarcts seldom require endovascular therapy given small vessel caliber; focus on medical management.","references":"1. Caplan LR et al.
