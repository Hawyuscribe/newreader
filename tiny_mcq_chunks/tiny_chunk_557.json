Among the answer choices, option C (2.1) most closely matches the established OR. Option A (1.3) and B (2.0) underestimate the association, while D (2.5) overestimates relative to meta\u2010analytic data.","conceptual_foundation":"EBV is classified under ICD-11 1E26.1 (Infectious mononucleosis). It establishes latency in B lymphocytes and has been implicated in MS via molecular mimicry and B\u2010cell dysregulation. Historically, the link was first noted in case\u2013control studies in the 1970s and confirmed by long\u2010term prospective cohorts in the early 2000s (Ascherio et al. Arch Neurol. 2001;58(10):1493\u20131498). EBV seropositivity is nearly universal in MS patients (>98%).","pathophysiology":"Normal EBV infection elicits strong cytotoxic T\u2010cell responses and formation of memory B cells. In individuals predisposed to MS, loss of immune regulation leads to chronic activation of autoreactive B cells. EBV\u2010infected B cells may cross the blood\u2013brain barrier via adhesion molecules (VLA-4) and present myelin antigens to T cells, triggering demyelination. Elevated EBNA-1 antibody titers precede MS onset by years.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients often report a history of mononucleosis 5\u201315 years prior to MS onset.

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) pathology is characterized by AQP4-IgG\u2013mediated astrocyte injury with perivascular deposition of immunoglobulin and complement in a vasculo-concentric, \u2018rosette-like\u2019 pattern around vessels (Lucchinetti et al., 2002; Wingerchuk et al., 2007).

Diagnostic criteria (2015 International Panel) require AQP4-IgG seropositivity and core clinical characteristics (optic neuritis, LETM, area postrema syndrome). Differential includes MS, MOG-IgG\u2013associated disease, myelitis from other etiologies. Historically classified as a variant of MS until the discovery of AQP4 antibodies in 2004.","pathophysiology":"AQP4-IgG targets the water channel aquaporin-4 on astrocyte foot processes, activating complement (C1q\u2013C9) and recruiting neutrophils and eosinophils. This leads to secondary demyelination, necrosis, and cavitation. Complement activation produces membrane attack complexes, correlating with the perivascular immune deposition seen in histology. The rosette pattern reflects concentric layers of complement deposition around hyalinized vessels.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with severe optic neuritis (acute vision loss, painful eye movements) and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM; \u22653 vertebral segments) often with necrotic cord lesions. Area postrema syndrome (intractable hiccups/nausea) is unique. Onset median age is 40 years; ~80% female. Attacks produce incomplete recovery, leading to significant disability if untreated.","diagnostic_approach":"NMO diagnosis relies on AQP4-IgG assay (cell-based assay sensitivity 75\u201390%, specificity >99%), MRI brain and spine demonstrating LETM, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. CSF shows pleocytosis with neutrophils and eosinophils; oligoclonal bands are rare. Criteria: at least one core clinical characteristic plus AQP4-IgG positivity or two if seronegative, along with supportive MRI.","management_principles":"Acute attacks: high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1\u200ag daily \u00d75 days); plasmapheresis if no response. Long-term relapse prevention: rituximab (off-label; 375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74 then every 6 months), mycophenolate mofetil (2\u20133 g daily), or azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg daily) (Level B evidence; Wang et al., 2016). Eculizumab is FDA-approved for AQP4-IgG\u2013positive NMO (PREVENT trial; Pittock et al., 2019): HR for relapse 0.06; 95% CI 0.02\u20130.20.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor CD19+ B cells if on rituximab, CBC/LFTs if on azathioprine or mycophenolate, and meningococcal vaccine before eculizumab.

AQP4-IgG is highly specific (>99%) for NMO; a negative result in high-pretest probability warrants retesting (cell-based assay). 2. LETM (\u22653 vertebral segments) strongly suggests NMO over MS (<50% specificity in MS). 3. Area postrema syndrome (intractable nausea/vomiting) is unique to NMO. 4. Early initiation of B-cell\u2013depleting therapy reduces relapse rates by >80%. 5. Unlike MS, interferon and natalizumab can worsen NMO and should be avoided.","references":"1.

EBV. Epstein\u2013Barr virus has the strongest and most consistent epidemiologic and mechanistic link to multiple sclerosis pathophysiology, with nearly universal seropositivity in MS patients and prospective cohort data showing a 7-fold increased risk after infectious mononucleosis (Munger et al. 2004, Bjornevik et al. 2022). Vitamin B12 deficiency (option B) is associated with subacute combined degeneration and myelopathy, not CNS demyelination of MS. HHV-6 (option C) has been investigated, but associations are weaker and less reproducible (Soldan et al. 1997), lacking the high-level evidence that supports EBV as a key environmental risk factor.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (ICD-11: 8A40). It is characterized by focal inflammatory demyelination, axonal loss, and gliosis. The diagnosis rests on demonstrating dissemination in time and space per the 2017 McDonald criteria (Thompson et al. 2018). Differential diagnoses include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, leukodystrophies, and vascular or metabolic white matter diseases. Historically, MS was described by Charcot in 1868; classification has evolved from clinical subtypes (relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive) to include MRI and biomarker features. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from the neuroepithelial ventricular zone and migrate periventricularly; their destruction underlies demyelination. Key neuroanatomic substrates include periventricular white matter, corpus callosum, optic nerves, and spinal cord, all receiving perfusion from watershed arterial territories susceptible to immune cell entry. Molecularly, MS links to HLA-DRB1*15:01 and other immune-related loci, with autoreactive T-cells and B-cells targeting myelin proteins (MBP, MOG, PLP). EBV-infected B-cells may drive autoimmunity via molecular mimicry or by providing aberrant costimulatory signals to autoreactive lymphocytes.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: CNS immune surveillance involves restricted lymphocyte trafficking across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) via regulated expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines. In MS, autoreactive CD4+ Th1 and Th17 cells recognize myelin antigens and migrate across the BBB through upregulated VLA-4/VCAM-1 interactions. EBV infects B-cells, promoting their survival and possibly presenting CNS-cross\u00adreactive epitopes. Inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17) activate microglia and macrophages, producing nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species that damage myelin and axons. Chronic inflammation leads to astrocytic scarring and neurodegeneration. Temporal progression: initial inflammatory demyelination (relapses) transitions to progressive axonal loss with less overt inflammation. EBV-specific immune responses correlate with lesion activity, suggesting a persistent pathogenic role.","clinical_manifestation":"MS most commonly presents in young adults (20\u201340 years), with a female:male ratio of approximately 3:1. Cardinal features include optic neuritis (20\u201330%), internuclear ophthalmoplegia, transverse myelitis, sensory disturbances, and cerebellar ataxia. Relapsing-remitting MS accounts for ~85% of initial presentations, with variable severity. Uncommon variants include tumefactive demyelination and Marburg\u2019s acute MS. Natural history without treatment shows accumulation of disability over decades, with an average time to secondary progression of 19 years. Diagnostic criteria (2017 McDonald) have a sensitivity of ~87% and specificity of ~94% for early diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI brain/spine with and without gadolinium per 2017 McDonald\u2014demonstration of \u22652 lesions disseminated in time and space; sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~90%. CSF: oligoclonal IgG bands present in ~95% of MS patients (sensitivity 0.95, specificity 0.86). Evoked potentials as supportive. Second-tier: serum AQP4 and MOG antibodies to exclude NMO-SD. Third-tier: advanced imaging (7T MRI, PET) in research settings. Pre-test probability based on typical clinical syndromes and MRI findings.","management_principles":"Disease-modifying therapies per AAN 2021 guidelines: first-line injectable therapies (interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate) reduce relapse rate by ~30% (Level A). High-efficacy therapies (natalizumab, ocrelizumab) reduce relapse rate by 68\u201383% (Level A) but carry risks (PML, infusion reactions). Treatment selection based on prognostic factors, risk tolerance, and monitoring (JCV index, CD19+ B-cell counts). Acute relapses treated with high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day \u00d7 3\u20135 days; NNT \u2248 4 for relapse resolution).","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical visits every 6 months (or quarterly for high-activity disease), annual MRI to assess subclinical activity, laboratory monitoring per therapy (e.g., CBC, LFTs, JCV antibody index). Annual assessment of disability (EDSS) and cognition (MSFC). Adjust therapy upon detection of breakthrough disease or safety signals.","clinical_pearls":"1. EBV seropositivity precedes MS by years; near-universal in MS patients. 2. Oligoclonal bands in CSF remain the most sensitive diagnostic biomarker. 3. Early high-efficacy therapy improves long-term outcomes and delays progression. 4. Natalizumab requires JCV index monitoring to mitigate PML risk. 5. Smoking cessation reduces relapse rate and delays disability accumulation.","references":"1. Bjornevik K et al. Science. 2022;376(6585):296\u2013301. doi:10.1126/science.abj8222 2. Thompson AJ et al.
