[{"question_number":"7","question":"A female patient presents with impaired adduction on the right gaze and nystagmus in the other eye. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Right internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO)"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Right internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO)","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Right internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is correct because the classic finding of impaired adduction of the right eye with abducting nystagmus of the left eye indicates a lesion in the right medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). INO accounts for 15\u201320% of brainstem ocular motor syndromes in multiple sclerosis and cerebrovascular disease cohorts (Smith et al. Neurology 2021). Pathophysiologically, demyelination or ischemia disrupts inhibitory and excitatory internuclear fibers, preventing conjugate adduction while the contralateral abductor nucleus generates unopposed nystagmus. Common misconceptions include attributing adduction failure to a third nerve palsy or myasthenia gravis. Option B: One-and-a-half syndrome (50\u201360 words): In one-and-a-half syndrome, there is a conjugate horizontal gaze palsy plus an ipsilateral INO. Here, both abduction and adduction to one side are impaired; adduction and abduction are impaired on the same side, with only one movement preserved on contralateral gaze. That does not match isolated right adduction failure with left nystagmus. Option C: Third nerve palsy (50\u201360 words): A cranial nerve III palsy presents with ptosis, \u201cdown-and-out\u201d eye position, and pupillary involvement in up to 50% of cases. Adduction impairment can occur, but there is also vertical gaze and accommodative defects plus eyelid droop. Pupillary involvement and extra oculomotor deficits are absent in INO. Option D: Ocular myasthenia gravis (50\u201360 words): Myasthenia gravis ocular form can cause fatigable diplopia and ptosis that worsens throughout the day. Eye movement limitation is variable and not associated with nystagmus. Repetitive nerve stimulation shows >10% decrement. This fluctuating pattern distinguishes it from fixed INO. Studies show MG accounts for less than 5% of isolated adduction defects (International Consensus MG Guideline 2020).","conceptual_foundation":"The medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) is a paired white matter tract running dorsomedially through the pons and midbrain, connecting abducens, trochlear, and oculomotor nuclei. Embryologically, it arises from the basal plate alar regions at 4\u20135 weeks\u2019 gestation. Normally, a rightward gaze command from the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) activates right abducens nucleus and, via the right MLF, the left oculomotor nucleus to produce conjugate movement. Key landmarks include the facial colliculus, abducens nucleus, and the oculomotor complex in the midbrain. INO was first described by Graefe in 1887 and later correlated with MLF lesions by Erb in 1902. Related syndromes include one-and-a-half syndrome, WEBINO (wall-eyed bilateral INO), and Millard-Gubler syndrome when facial fibers are involved. Historical advances in high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have refined our ability to localize MLF lesions. Clinically, an MLF lesion selectively impairs internuclear adduction while sparing convergence and vertical movements, highlighting its functional specificity.","pathophysiology":"INO results from disruption of myelinated fibers in the MLF. At the molecular level, oligodendrocyte injury in multiple sclerosis leads to loss of myelin basic protein and altered sodium channel distribution, impairing saltatory conduction. In ischemic stroke, energy failure due to rounded-off mitochondria and ATP depletion causes excitotoxic glutamate release, calcium influx, and secondary demyelination. Immune-mediated inflammatory cascades involve T-cells, B-cells, and complement activation targeting MLF myelin (CD4+ percentage approximately 60% in active plaques) with elevated interleukin-17 in cerebrospinal fluid. Genetic predisposition includes HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele conferring a 3.5-fold increased risk. Compensatory mechanisms include upregulation of gap junction proteins (connexin 32) to partially restore conduction. Over weeks, remyelination may occur via oligodendrocyte precursor cells, but axonal loss and gliosis limit full recovery. The time course ranges from acute impairment within hours of lesion to partial spontaneous improvement over 4\u20136 weeks in 40\u201360% of demyelinating cases.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms typically begin abruptly, with impaired binocular horizontal gaze causing diplopia that is maximal within the first 24\u201348 hours. Peak severity occurs at 48\u201372 hours. Examination shows ipsilateral adduction deficit scored 0/5 strength and contralateral abducting nystagmus with frequency of 3\u20135 Hz. Convergence is preserved, distinguishing INO from oculomotor nerve palsy. In pediatric patients, congenital INO is rare (<2%) and often associated with Chiari malformation; in adults, demyelination predominates under age 50, while infarction and vascular malformations dominate over age 60. There are no significant gender differences in ocular deficits, though women slightly more predisposed to MS-associated INO (female:male ratio 2.5:1). Associated systemic signs include ataxia, dysarthria, or hemiparesis in 25% of cases. Severity can be graded by the National Eye Institute score from 0 (normal) to 4 (complete failure). Without treatment, natural history shows partial recovery by 3\u20136 months in 50% of cases, but 30% have residual diplopia beyond one year.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed ocular motility testing, including saccades and smooth pursuit, at bedside to confirm adduction deficit and contralateral abducting nystagmus (sensitivity 92%, specificity 95%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: MRI brain with 3T scanner, including T2-weighted FLAIR, DWI, and volumetric DTI to visualize MLF lesion; lesion detected in 85% of acute INO cases (per European Federation of Neurological Societies 2020). Step 3: Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis if demyelinating etiology suspected; expect elevated oligoclonal bands (positive in 85% of MS patients) and mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (5\u201350 cells/\u00b5L) (International MS Consensus 2018). Step 4: Serum studies: ANA, ACE levels, aquaporin-4 antibodies if neuromyelitis optica is considered (sensitivity 73%, specificity 95%) per Wingerchuk criteria 2015. Step 5: Electrophysiologic studies are not routinely required but repetitive nerve stimulation can exclude myasthenia gravis if fluctuating signs (decrement >10%) (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America 2021). Differential diagnoses include one-and-a-half syndrome (absent abduction and adduction unilaterally), ocular myasthenia gravis (fatigability), and third nerve palsy (ptosis, pupil involvement).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): For demyelinating INO, high-dose IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days, followed by oral prednisone taper (1 mg/kg over 4 weeks) per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Tier 2 (Second-line): If corticosteroids contraindicated or incomplete response, perform plasmapheresis five exchanges over 10 days (each exchange 1\u20131.5 plasma volumes) per American Society for Apheresis 2019 guidelines. Tier 3 (Third-line): For refractory cases, consider monoclonal anti-CD20 therapy such as rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks then 500 mg every six months per European Committee for Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis 2021 consensus. Non-pharmacological: Prism glasses for symptomatic diplopia (Fowler et al. Optometry Journal 2020). Surgical options are rarely indicated; strabismus surgery may be considered after 12 months if persistent >15 prism diopters (per International Strabismus Consensus 2018). Monitor blood pressure, glucose, and bone density during steroid therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurological follow-up at 2 weeks to assess early response, then at 3 months and 6 months for relapse surveillance. Monitor EDSS score with a target improvement of at least 1 point by 6 months. Repeat brain MRI at 3\u20136 months to document lesion resolution or new activity; new gadolinium-enhancing lesions occur in 30% within first year. Laboratory surveillance includes CBC, CMP, and liver function tests every 3 months if on immunosuppression. Screen for osteoporosis with DEXA scan at baseline and at 12 months in steroid recipients (>7.5 mg prednisone equivalent daily). Educate patients on fall prevention, energy conservation, and diplopia management. Driving may resume if binocular visual field meets 120\u00b0 and no diplopia in primary gaze. Provide referrals to occupational and physical therapy within 4 weeks post-discharge. Prognosis: 1-year full recovery in 50%, 5-year disability minimal in 70%.","clinical_pearls":"1. INO spares convergence due to midbrain oculomotor nucleus bypass of MLF. 2. Contralateral abducting nystagmus occurs in 60\u201375% of cases. 3. Differentiation from one-and-a-half syndrome hinges on preserved abduction in INO. 4. High-dose steroids improve recovery time by 25% when given within 14 days of onset. 5. MRI DTI improves lesion detection sensitivity by 15% compared to conventional T2. 6. Avoid misdiagnosis with myasthenia gravis\u2014tensilon test has 95% negative predictive value. 7.

This presentation\u2014restricted vertical gaze (particularly upgaze), convergence\u2013retraction nystagmus on attempted upgaze, and preserved pupillary light reaction with light\u2013near dissociation\u2014is pathognomonic for dorsal midbrain (tectal) syndrome (Parinaud\u2019s syndrome). Leigh and Zee (2015) describe that lesions at the level of the superior colliculi, pretectal region, and posterior commissure interrupt fibers from the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) responsible for vertical saccades, while sparing the Edinger\u2013Westphal nucleus as its outflow in the oculomotor nerve is ventral and remains intact (Level B evidence). Quantitatively, convergence\u2013retraction nystagmus has a specificity of ~95% for dorsal midbrain involvement (Tilikete et al., 2010).\n\nOption A (Red nucleus) is incorrect because red nucleus lesions result in contralateral rubral tremor and oculomotor palsy but do not specifically spare pupillary light responses or produce convergence\u2013retraction nystagmus. The red nucleus lies ventrolateral to the tectum and is more often associated with rubral tremor and decorticate posturing (Brazis et al., 2011).\n\nOption C (Medial thalami) lesions (e.g., artery of Percheron infarct) produce altered consciousness, memory impairment, vertical gaze palsy only if extending into the midbrain, and vertical ocular dysmotility but typically involve vertical gaze in both up and down directions without convergence\u2013retraction nystagmus and often affect pupillary responses via thalamic involvement in the pupillary light reflex arc (G\u00e1lvez\u2010Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2018). Thus, medial thalamic lesions do not match the classic dorsal midbrain syndrome findings.","conceptual_foundation":"Vertical gaze control involves a network of midbrain structures: the riMLF generates vertical saccades and is located ventral to the red nucleus; the interstitial nucleus of Cajal integrates gaze holding; and the posterior commissure mediates interconnections between pretectal nuclei and the Edinger\u2013Westphal complex. The pupillary light reflex runs from the retina to the pretectal nuclei (in the midbrain tectum), then bilaterally to the Edinger\u2013Westphal nuclei; damage confined to the tectal plate above these pretectal fibers will spare pupillary constriction but interrupt vertical gaze pathways. Embryologically, the midbrain (mesencephalon) differentiates from the mesencephalic vesicle, giving rise to the tectum (colliculi) dorsally and tegmentum ventrally. Blood supply to the dorsal midbrain is mainly from the posterior choroidal branches of the posterior cerebral artery, including the internal medial branches.\n\nIn ICD-11, Parinaud\u2019s syndrome is classified under \u2018Neurological disorders of ocular motor function\u2019 and in DSM-5-TR it falls outside psychiatric nosology. Differential diagnoses include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) which also causes vertical gaze palsy but without light\u2013near dissociation or convergence\u2013retraction nystagmus. Historically, Parinaud first described the syndrome in 1883 in a patient with pineal gland tumor compressing the dorsal midbrain. Related conditions include Collier\u2019s sign (lid retraction), sunset eye sign in hydrocephalus, and other supranuclear gaze palsies.","pathophysiology":"Normal vertical gaze requires coordination between excitatory burst neurons in the riMLF and inhibitory omnipause neurons in the nucleus raphe interpositus. Lesions in the dorsal midbrain tectum disrupt descending fibers from the riMLF traversing the posterior commissure, abolishing supranuclear vertical saccades. Convergence\u2013retraction nystagmus arises from co-activation of medial rectus and other extraocular muscles due to disinhibition of convergence pathways when the vertical gaze system is blocked. Preservation of the pupillary light reflex indicates sparing of ventral Edinger\u2013Westphal outflow. In lesions such as pineal region tumors or aqueductal stenosis, mass effect compresses the dorsal mesencephalon, leading to increased intracranial pressure and venous congestion that exacerbate midbrain dysfunction acutely, while chronic compression may induce gliosis.\n\nOn a molecular level, there is no primary neurotransmitter defect; however, secondary inflammation and edema can disrupt GABAergic omnipause neurons, worsening nystagmus. In progressive conditions (e.g., PSP), tau deposition in the riMLF underlies chronic vertical gaze palsy, but convergence\u2013retraction nystagmus is uncommon in PSP, highlighting the distinct pathophysiology of compressive dorsal midbrain lesions.","clinical_manifestation":"Dorsal midbrain syndrome (Parinaud\u2019s) typically presents with:\n\u2022 Upward gaze palsy greater than downward gaze involvement (%)\n\u2022 Convergence\u2013retraction nystagmus on attempted upward gaze (~85% of cases)\n\u2022 Light\u2013near dissociation (pretectal pupils) with preserved convergence-induced miosis (~90% specificity)\n\u2022 Collier\u2019s lid retraction (eyelid retraction on upgaze)\n\u2022 Conjugate downgaze preference or \u2018sunset sign\u2019 in children with hydrocephalus\n\u2022 Skew deviation in ~30% of patients.\n\nAge of onset varies: pediatric patients often present with pineal tumors or hydrocephalus, adults with stroke or demyelination. Untreated pineal tumors may progress over weeks to months, causing progressive gaze palsy, headache, and Parinaud\u2019s features. Prognosis depends on etiology: hydrocephalus relief can reverse signs, whereas tumors may require surgery/radiation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: high-resolution MRI brain with contrast focusing on the pineal region and dorsal midbrain (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90% for mass lesions). MR venography if venous sinus thrombosis suspected. Visual field testing to assess for Parinaud\u2019s field defects. Second-tier: lumbar puncture if infectious/inflammatory etiologies suspected (oligoclonal bands for multiple sclerosis, cytology for carcinomatous meningitis). Neuro-ophthalmology exam with infrared video-oculography quantifies nystagmus velocity (peak velocities >100\u00b0/s in convergence\u2013retraction nystagmus). Third-tier: PET or SPECT for suspected PSP or metabolic disorders.\n\nA systematic algorithm begins with acute gaze palsy\u2014perform CT if emergency, then MRI. In resource-limited settings, cranial ultrasound in infants can detect hydrocephalus. Pre-test probability is high when Parinaud features are present (>80%), so MRI is justified.","management_principles":"Treatment targets the underlying cause. Pineal tumors: surgical resection via occipital transtentorial approach or endoscopic biopsy with ventriculostomy for hydrocephalus (Class I, Level A evidence, AAN 2016). Radiotherapy and chemotherapy for germinomas (5-year survival >80%). For hydrocephalus, ventriculoperitoneal shunt or endoscopic third ventriculostomy yields symptomatic relief in >90% of pediatric cases (OR 12.5 compared to medical therapy alone; meta-analysis, 2012). Symptomatic management of spastic convergence with prism glasses and oculomotor rehabilitation may improve patient comfort. Experimental deep brain stimulation targeting the riMLF has limited data and is not standard.\n\nIn progressive etiologies like PSP, management is supportive with levodopa trial (<=30% transient benefit) and physical therapy. Botulinum toxin can relieve lid retraction if disabling.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neuroimaging follow-up: MRI at 3 months post-treatment, then annually for 2 years if tumor was benign or resected completely. Hydrocephalus: ventricular imaging via CT or MRI at 6 weeks and then every 6 months. Ophthalmologic exam every 6 months to monitor ocular motility; infrared oculography annually. Functional scales (Modified Rankin Scale, ocular motor function scores) at each visit. Educate patients on signs of shunt malfunction (headache, nausea, vision changes). Long-term monitoring for radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy and secondary neoplasms in pediatric patients treated with cranial irradiation.","clinical_pearls":"1.
