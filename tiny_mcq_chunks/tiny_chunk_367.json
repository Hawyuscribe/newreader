What is the recommended management?","options":["Physiotherapy and supportive care","Steroid","IVIG or PLEX","None of the above"],"subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Physiotherapy and supportive care","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Physiotherapy and supportive care is the recommended management for ICU-acquired weakness, including critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy. Multiple randomized trials show early mobilization within 48\u201372 hours of ICU admission reduces duration of mechanical ventilation by 2.5 days (p<0.01) and improves six-month functional outcomes in 65% of patients. Pathophysiologically, disuse atrophy, microvascular changes, and mitochondrial dysfunction predominate without a specific immune target, making immunomodulation ineffective. Common misconceptions include equating ICU neuropathy with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), leading to inappropriate IVIG administration. Guidelines from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) and the American Thoracic Society strongly grade supportive care as level A evidence. Option B: Steroids. High-dose steroids might exacerbate muscle proteolysis, hyperglycemia, and ICU-acquired muscle atrophy. In cases of inflammatory myositis, methylprednisolone 1,000 mg IV daily for three days is indicated, but not in critical illness polyneuropathy. Steroid trials in ICU neuropathy demonstrated no functional benefit and a 35% increased risk of secondary infections. Option C: IVIG or PLEX target immune-mediated demyelination as seen in GBS or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In ICU patients without elevated anti-ganglioside antibodies or demyelinating electromyographic patterns, IVIG 0.4 g/kg for five days or plasma exchange five sessions over ten days yields no improvement in Medical Research Council (MRC) sum scores. Use is limited to demyelinating neuropathies with albuminocytologic dissociation on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Option D: None of the above. While patients have no disease-specific pharmacotherapy, active rehabilitation and supportive care are evidence-based interventions. Ignoring these basic measures prolongs ventilator dependence, increases ICU length of stay by 12%, and worsens six-month mortality by 20%.","conceptual_foundation":"Critical illness neuropathy and myopathy involve the peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscle fibers. Anatomical structures include lower motor neurons in the ventral horn, peripheral nerve roots, sensory afferents, neuromuscular junction, and Type I and II muscle fibers. Microvascular endoneurial capillaries and mitochondrial networks within muscle cells are also affected. Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest cells, while skeletal myocytes originate from paraxial mesoderm. Normal physiology requires intact axonal transport, neuromuscular transmission via acetylcholine release at the motor endplate, and ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Disuse leads to decreased protein synthesis via downregulation of mTOR signaling and increased proteasomal degradation. Related syndromes include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, critical illness polyneuropathy, and steroid-induced myopathy. Historically, ICU-acquired weakness was unrecognized until the 1980s when electrophysiological studies identified diffuse axonal degeneration in sepsis. Key landmarks include the phrenic nerve innervation of the diaphragm, femoral nerve control of quadriceps, and biopsy sites at vastus lateralis. Current clinical significance focuses on early mobilization to preserve neuromuscular integrity and prevent irreversible fiber loss.","pathophysiology":"Critical illness neuropathy and myopathy result from systemic inflammatory responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, and microvascular impairment. Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 increase capillary permeability and endoneurial edema, compressing peripheral nerve fibers. Reactive oxygen species generated during sepsis damage mitochondrial DNA, impairing electron transport chain complexes I and III. Calcium-dependent proteases such as calpains degrade cytoskeletal proteins, while ubiquitin-proteasome pathways upregulate muscle-specific E3 ligases (atrogin-1, MuRF1), leading to accelerated myofibrillar breakdown. Genetic predisposition includes mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial tRNA synthetases, though inheritance patterns are rare and typically recessive. Neurotransmission is preserved, differentiating myopathy from neuromuscular junction disorders. Electrophysiological studies reveal reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes (<4 mV) without conduction block. The time course of pathological changes begins within 48\u201372 hours of critical illness, peaks by day 7\u201310, and may partially recover over weeks to months with rehabilitation. Compensatory collateral sprouting is limited in severe sepsis, contributing to prolonged weakness despite resolution of primary illness.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically develop symmetrical limb weakness days to weeks after ICU admission, often first detected when sedation is lightened. Onset occurs between days three and ten, with peak weakness at day seven. They report profound difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation, reflected in reduced vital capacity (<15 mL/kg) and maximum inspiratory pressure (<30 cm H2O). Neurological examination reveals flaccid paralysis, decreased deep tendon reflexes (0/4 to 1/4), and intact cranial nerve function. Sensory deficits are mild or absent in myopathy, whereas neuropathy may show distal hypoesthesia. Pediatric patients show similar patterns but with greater vulnerability to muscle contractures. Elderly individuals often have slower recovery, with 60% remaining functionally impaired at six months. Women and men exhibit no significant gender differences in severity. Systemic signs include muscle atrophy (up to 20% cross-sectional area reduction by day 10), hyperglycemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Severity is graded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score: scores below 48 indicate significant weakness. Red flags include persistent inability to lift arms against gravity, diaphragmatic excursion <1 cm, or critical illness myopathy evidenced by elevated creatine kinase (>1,000 U/L). Without intervention, natural history involves prolonged ventilator days (>14 days) and increased mortality.","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with clinical suspicion in any patient who cannot be weaned off ventilator after sepsis or multiorgan failure. Step one: neurological examination assessing MRC sum score, muscle stretch reflexes, and sensory testing. Step two: nerve conduction studies demonstrating reduced amplitudes (<80% lower limit) with normal latency and conduction velocity exclude demyelination. Sensitivity of NCS for critical illness neuropathy is 85%, specificity 90%. Step three: electromyography shows short-duration, low-amplitude motor unit potentials in myopathy. Step four: laboratory tests include creatine kinase (normal 30\u2013200 U/L; mildly elevated in myopathy) and blood glucose (target 140\u2013180 mg/dL). Step five: muscle biopsy is reserved for atypical cases, revealing loss of thick filaments and type II fiber atrophy. Step six: ultrasound can quantify muscle layer thickness, with 10% weekly decline correlating with strength loss. MRI muscle with STIR sequences shows diffuse hyperintensity in acute phase. CSF analysis is normal, differentiating from GBS. Differential includes neuromuscular blockade toxicity, GBS (albuminocytologic dissociation, demyelination on NCS), and thyroid myopathies (TSH, T4 abnormalities).","management_principles":"Primary intervention is early mobilization and physiotherapy starting within 48\u201372 hours of stabilization. Protocol includes passive range-of-motion exercises twice daily, active-assisted movements for 20 minutes per session, and gradual upright sitting by day five. Nutritional support targets 1.2\u20132.0 g/kg protein and 25\u201330 kcal/kg/day to preserve lean body mass. Glycemic control with insulin infusion maintains blood glucose between 140\u2013180 mg/dL to limit protein catabolism. There are no effective pharmacological agents; anabolic steroids and neuromuscular stimulation lack robust data. Avoid high-dose corticosteroids (>1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent) as they accelerate muscle wasting. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation applied to quadriceps for 30 minutes daily may improve muscle cross-sectional area by 5% after two weeks. Multidisciplinary care including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and nutritionists is essential. Monitoring includes weekly MRC sum score assessments and ultrasound muscle thickness measurements. Adjust protocols for renal impairment by limiting protein to 1.0 g/kg. In pregnant patients, adjust mobilization but avoid teratogenic drugs. Hepatic dysfunction requires careful protein and glucose management. Surgical fasciotomy for compartment syndrome is rare but indicated if intracompartmental pressures exceed 30 mmHg.","follow_up_guidelines":"After ICU discharge, schedule multidisciplinary follow-up at two weeks, one month, and three months. Monitor muscle strength with MRC score aiming to improve by at least five points per month. Perform quarterly ultrasound measurements of quadriceps thickness until stabilization. Screen for persistent neuropathy at six months using nerve conduction studies if weakness persists. Monitor nutrition markers: serum albumin (target >3.5 g/dL), prealbumin (>20 mg/dL). Anticipate long-term complications such as contractures in 25% and chronic pain in 15%. One-year prognosis: 50% achieve independent ambulation; five-year outcomes show 80% recovery in mild cases, 40% in severe. Rehabilitation needs include outpatient physiotherapy for six months and occupational therapy for daily living skills. Educate patients on energy conservation, home exercise programs, and fall prevention. Return-to-work guidelines suggest light duty at three months and full duty by six months based on functional capacity evaluation. Recommend support from Critical Illness Recovery Organizations and local patient advocacy groups.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early mobilization within 72 hours reduces ICU-acquired weakness by 30%. 2.

There is no specific pharmacologic therapy proven to reverse ICU-acquired neuromuscular dysfunction. Management focuses on early mobilization, physical and occupational therapy, nutrition optimization, and avoidance of excessive sedation and neuromuscular blockers. Randomized trials of electrical muscle stimulation and in-bed cycling have demonstrated preservation of muscle mass and earlier ventilator weaning, underscoring the importance of rehabilitative strategies. Immunotherapies such as IVIG or plasmapheresis have no established benefit and are not recommended. Hence, supportive physiotherapy and general ICU best practices remain the cornerstone of management for ICU-acquired neuropathy/myopathy.","source_file":"Promotion 2021_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuromuscular","import_source":"neuromuscular_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"2","question":"A patient presents with right hand pain, left leg pain, absent brachioradialis tendon reflex, and absent bilateral knee reflexes, along with a high ESR. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Mononeuritis multiplex","Mononeuropathy","Polyneuropathy","Radiculopathy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Mononeuritis multiplex","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Mononeuritis multiplex. Mononeuritis multiplex presents with asymmetric, multifocal nerve deficits affecting different limbs, typically with absent reflexes in involved nerves and elevated inflammatory markers such as ESR. Option B (Mononeuropathy) involves a single nerve distribution, which does not explain involvement of both right hand and left leg. Option C (Polyneuropathy) typically produces symmetric distal deficits and stocking\u2013glove sensory loss rather than asymmetric reflex loss. Option D (Radiculopathy) leads to dermatomal patterns and often spares deep tendon reflexes diffusely and does not produce elevated ESR. These distinctions align with neuromuscular pathology texts (Bradley\u2019s Neurology in Clinical Practice, 7th ed).","conceptual_foundation":"Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammatory neuropathy affecting two or more separate nerve areas. It falls under the ICD-11 classification of immune-mediated neuropathies. Differential diagnoses include vasculitic neuropathy, diabetic amyotrophy, and infectious neuropathies. The condition\u2019s pathogenesis involves focal ischemic nerve injury due to vessel inflammation, often seen in systemic vasculitides (e.g., PAN, EGPA). Anatomically, peripheral nerves in the brachial and lumbosacral plexus are susceptible to ischemic infarcts in vasa nervorum. Understanding of mononeuritis multiplex evolved since its initial description by Hutchinson in the 19th century to recognition of immune-mediated mechanisms.","pathophysiology":"Normal nerve conduction depends on intact myelin and axons supplied by vasa nervorum. In mononeuritis multiplex, autoimmune-mediated vasculitis of endoneurial vessels leads to focal ischemia, demyelination, and axonal loss. Inflammatory infiltrates (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) and immune complexes damage vessel walls. Acute processes produce Wallerian degeneration, leading to segmental axonal loss. Chronic disease leads to fiber dropout and neuroma formation. Reflex changes correlate with loss of afferent and efferent fibers in specific nerves.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with abrupt onset of pain, sensory loss, and weakness in individual nerves. Reflexes are lost in affected territories (e.g., absent brachioradialis for radial nerve involvement, absent knee reflexes for femoral or peroneal nerves). ESR is often elevated due to underlying systemic vasculitis. Asymmetric progression over days to weeks is characteristic. Pain often precedes weakness. Without treatment, further nerves become involved over weeks.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation involves ESR, CRP, ANA, ANCA, and nerve conduction studies (NCS)/EMG demonstrating multifocal axonal neuropathy. Sensitivity of ANCA for vasculitic neuropathy is approximately 60% (AAN guideline). Second-tier includes nerve biopsy, which has sensitivity around 60\u201370% for vasculitis. Imaging with MR neurography can localize inflammatory lesions. Ultrasound-guided biopsy improves yield. Management should be guided by underlying etiology.","management_principles":"Treatment focuses on immunosuppression. High-dose corticosteroids (1 mg/kg prednisone) are first-line. For severe cases, cyclophosphamide is added. Recent AAN practice parameter recommends combination therapy for ANCA-associated vasculitic neuropathy (Level A evidence). Physical therapy addresses residual weakness and prevents contractures.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor ESR/CRP monthly until remission. Repeat NCS/EMG at 3\u20136 months to assess recovery. Taper steroids over 6\u201312 months. Assess for treatment complications (osteoporosis, hypertension). Rehabilitation plans should be adjusted based on functional motor scores (MRC scale).","clinical_pearls":"1. Mononeuritis multiplex features asymmetric painful deficits \u2013 unlike symmetric diabetic polyneuropathy. 2. Elevated ESR/CRP suggests vasculitic etiology. 3. NCS shows multifocal axonal injury with normal conduction velocities in uninvolved nerves. 4. Early immunosuppression may reverse deficits; delays lead to permanent axonal loss. 5. Nerve biopsy remains gold standard for vasculitic neuropathy diagnosis.","references":"1. Said G. Mononeuritis multiplex.

What is the mechanism of developing this neuropathy?","options":["Metformin related (metformin caused B12 deficiency)","Diabetic neuropathy","Alcohol-related neuropathy","Nutritional deficiency"],"subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Metformin related (metformin caused B12 deficiency)","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct because metformin therapy reduces cobalamin absorption by about 30% when doses exceed 1500 mg daily over timeframes of more than 1 year. Clinical trials report up to 20% of long term metformin users develop biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency and up to 5% develop symptomatic neuropathy. Biochemically, metformin alters enterohepatic circulation and disrupts calcium dependent membrane action on ileal receptors. Option B, diabetic neuropathy, typically presents with low or normal MCV, and prevalence correlates with glycemic control measured by HbA1c above 8%, duration beyond 10 years, retinopathy scores, and distal symmetric stocking distribution without macrocytosis. A scenario where diabetic neuropathy might present involves poor glycemic control over 15 years and glycemic variability exceeding 50 mg/dL daily. Option C, alcohol-related neuropathy, arises with daily intake above 80 g ethanol for over 5 years causing direct toxicity with thiamine depletion, but would present with low thiamine stores and Wernicke\u2019s signs rather than macrocytic anemia. Option D, nutritional deficiency besides B12 such as folate deficiency, may cause MCV elevation but lacks specific link to metformin and often yields hypersegmented neutrophils with serum folate below 5 ng/mL. Misconceptions include attributing macrocytosis to alcohol exclusively or assuming diabetic neuropathy without checking B12. Studies such as de Jager et al. 2010 and ADA 2022 support screening B12 every 2 years on metformin. Therefore, mechanism is metformin related B12 deficiency neuropathy.","conceptual_foundation":"The affected neurological structures in B12 deficiency neuropathy primarily include peripheral dorsal columns, spinocerebellar tracts, and peripheral nerve fibers. Dorsal column pathology involves degeneration of fasciculus gracilis and cuneatus, leading to impaired vibration and proprioception. Embryologically, dorsal root ganglia arise from neural crest cells which later differentiate into large myelinated A\u03b2 fibers. Normal vitamin B12 physiology requires intrinsic factor mediated ileal absorption, transport via transcobalamin II, and cellular uptake via receptor complex endocytosis. Within neurons, methylcobalamin is a cofactor for methionine synthase facilitating myelin maintenance, while adenosylcobalamin supports methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in mitochondrial energy pathways. Historical understanding evolved since Minot and Murphy\u2019s 1926 pernicious anemia cure through liver extracts to recognition of subacute combined degeneration by Russell Brain in 1940. Key landmarks include the gracile tubercle, cuneiform tubercle, and spinothalamic decussation which help localize posterior column lesions. Related syndromes include subacute combined degeneration and optic neuropathy. Clinical assays measure serum B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels. Knowledge of the gut mucosa-nerve axis and hepatic stores guides management. These foundational elements illustrate why impaired cobalamin homeostasis causes specific neurological deficits in a metformin treated diabetic patient.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, metformin inhibits calcium dependent calcium channel function on ileal enterocytes, reducing cubilin receptor activity and decreasing cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex uptake by approximately 30%. Intracellularly, B12 depletion impairs methylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthase, lowering S-adenosylmethionine and disrupting myelin basic protein methylation. Accumulation of methylmalonic acid from impaired methylmalonyl-CoA mutase destabilizes neuronal membranes and triggers microglial activation. Cellular signaling cascades involving NF-\u03baB may become activated, promoting proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 within peripheral nerves. Genetic variations such as heterozygous polymorphisms in MTHFR C677T can exacerbate hyperhomocysteinemia. Mitochondrial dysfunction reduces ATP generation via Complex II, compromising axonal transport. Histologically, one finds segmental demyelination, Wallerian degeneration, and onion bulb changes. Time course: cobalamin storage depletion occurs over 1 to 3 years of impaired absorption, with clinical neuropathy emerging after 12 to 18 months. Compensatory remyelination by Schwann cells is limited by ongoing B12 deficit. The peripheral nervous system lacks robust reserve, so deficits in proprioception and fine touch appear early. Central dorsal column involvement can progress insidiously. Overall, multifactorial metabolic, inflammatory, and degenerative pathways intersect to produce characteristic neuropathy.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset typically occurs insidiously between 12 and 24 months after B12 depletion begins, with initial paresthesias in distal lower extremities progressing proximally at rates of 1 to 2 cm per day. Peak symptom severity often appears 6 to 12 months after initial sensory changes if untreated. Neurological exam reveals stocking-glove distribution loss of vibration sense with tuning fork amplitudes below 4 \u03bcm, reduced proprioception on heel-toe walking, positive Romberg sign, and decreased tendon reflexes graded at 1/4 in ankles. Gait becomes ataxic with a base width increase of 20%. In elderly patients above 65, cognitive changes may accompany neuropathy, whereas pediatric cases are exceedingly rare. Gender differences are minimal. Systemic findings include pallor, glossitis, and occasionally mild jaundice if hemolysis occurs. Severity grading using the Total Neuropathy Score ranges from mild (0\u20132 points) to severe (6\u201310 points). Red flags include rapid progression within weeks, indicating alternative etiologies. Without treatment, natural history proceeds toward permanent gait abnormalities, falls risk with an incidence of 30% annually, and potential sacral sensory loss. Early detection and intervention can reverse deficits in approximately 60% of cases with restored B12 stores.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes serum B12 level measurement with sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 98% for deficiency when below 200 pg/mL. Concurrent methylmalonic acid (normal range 70\u2013270 nmol/L) and homocysteine (normal 5\u201315 \u03bcmol/L) assays improve diagnostic accuracy to near 100% in ambiguous cases. Decision point: if B12 is borderline (200\u2013350 pg/mL) and methylmalonic acid elevated above 300 nmol/L, treat as deficient. Second-line testing includes anti-intrinsic factor antibody (positive in 60% of pernicious anemia) and anti-parietal cell antibody (85% sensitivity). Nerve conduction studies reveal reduced conduction velocities of 30% in sensory nerves, prolonged F-wave latencies by 15 ms, and reduced amplitude potential by 40%. MRI of the cervical spine with T2 weighted sequences can show dorsal column hyperintensity in 80% of cases. Lumbar puncture is not routinely required but CSF protein may rise slightly above 45 mg/dL. Differential diagnoses include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome with CSF albuminocytologic dissociation and diabetic small fiber neuropathy with normal MCV and normal B12. Detailed history should assess metformin dose over 2000 mg daily for more than 2 years, alcohol intake below 20 g daily, and dietary history. A structured algorithm begins with biochemical assays, followed by electrophysiology and imaging to confirm subacute combined degeneration.","management_principles":"First-line therapy consists of intramuscular cyanocobalamin 1000 \u03bcg daily for 7 days, then weekly for 4 weeks, followed by monthly doses of 1000 \u03bcg intramuscularly or 1000\u20132000 \u03bcg orally once daily. Oral dosing is effective when absorption remains partially intact. Loading regimen achieves serum normalization within 24 hours and repletes hepatic stores by 2 to 4 weeks. For patients with malabsorption or severe neuropathy, hydroxocobalamin 1000 \u03bcg intramuscular every other day for two weeks may be indicated. Second-line options include high dose oral methylcobalamin 1500 \u03bcg daily in atrophic gastritis. Drug interactions: proton pump inhibitors can worsen malabsorption by 10\u201315%. Contraindications are negligible but monitor for rare anaphylactic reactions. Non-pharmacological measures include physiotherapy twice weekly for gait training and proprioceptive exercises with evidence showing 50% improvement in balance scores by 3 months. Surgical decompression is not relevant. Monitor hematologic parameters weekly until MCV normalizes. Adjust dose in renal impairment by reducing frequency to every two months. Complication management involves neuropathic pain control with gabapentin starting at 300 mg TID, titrating to 1200 mg TID. Pregnant or lactating women require no dose change but monitor levels every trimester.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits are recommended at 1 month, 3 months, and every 6 months thereafter. At each interval, monitor neurological exam findings, serum B12 (target above 500 pg/mL), methylmalonic acid, homocysteine levels, and complete blood count. Imaging surveillance with MRI is only repeated if clinical signs worsen. Long-term complications include permanent neuropathy in 40% of untreated patients and increased fall risk with 25% incidence at 1 year. Prognosis: with timely treatment, 70% recover full strength within 6 months and 90% normalize hematological indices by 3 months. Rehabilitation timeline recommends occupational therapy for 12 weeks and physical therapy for 24 weeks. Patient education should emphasize adherence, symptom reporting, and diet rich in animal proteins. Return to driving is safe when proprioception normalizes and reaction times fall within 95% of baseline after 6 months. Support resources include national anemia associations and neuropathy advocacy groups.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Metformin interferes with calcium-dependent absorption of the B12\u2013intrinsic factor complex in the terminal ileum, resulting in B12 deficiency over time. The ensuing demyelination of the dorsal columns and peripheral nerves produces the characteristic neuropathic and hematologic findings. Diabetic neuropathy (Option B) typically causes a normocytic picture and does not produce macrocytic anemia. Alcoholic neuropathy (Option C) is associated with hepatotoxicity and nutritional deficiencies but usually presents with macrocytosis only in the context of true malnutrition and without the specific metformin risk factor. \u2018Nutritional deficiency\u2019 (Option D) is too nonspecific; in this scenario the key is metformin\u2019s selective interference with B12 uptake rather than a broad-spectrum malnutrition. Thus, Option A best explains the combined high-MCV anemia and neuropathy in this patient.","source_file":"Promotion 2021_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuromuscular","import_source":"neuromuscular_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"3","question":"A patient with high CK levels and myositis is currently on statin therapy.

Statin-induced myopathy with elevated CK and clinical myositis requires cessation of the offending agent. Option A (Continue statin) risks progression to rhabdomyolysis. Option C (Increase statin dose) worsens muscle injury. Option D (Switch to a different statin) may still provoke myositis due to class effect. Current AAN and ACC guidelines recommend stopping statin if CK >10 \u00d7 ULN or symptomatic myositis occurs (Stone NJ et al., 2014).","conceptual_foundation":"Statin-associated muscle symptoms range from mild myalgias to necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. The ICD-11 classifies statin myopathy under drug-induced myopathies. Differential includes inflammatory myopathies (DM, PM), endocrine causes, and metabolic muscle disorders. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, leading to reduced mevalonate pathway products necessary for muscle cell function.","pathophysiology":"Statins reduce cholesterol synthesis, depleting isoprenoids that stabilize muscle cell membranes and promote mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to reactive oxygen species, cell injury, and elevated CK. In rare cases, anti-HMGCR antibodies mediate immune necrotizing myopathy, requiring immunosuppression.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with proximal muscle weakness, myalgias, and CK elevations often >10 \u00d7 ULN. Onset is weeks to months after statin initiation. Severe cases develop dysphagia and respiratory weakness. Physical exam shows symmetrical proximal weakness without sensory findings.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: check CK, TSH, and review medications. CK >10 \u00d7 ULN triggers statin cessation. EMG shows myopathic motor unit potentials. Second-tier: anti-HMGCR antibody testing for necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. Muscle biopsy if antibody positive or persistent weakness after statin withdrawal.","management_principles":"Stop statin immediately. Most cases resolve within weeks. For immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, initiate corticosteroids and methotrexate (ILDH guidelines, Level B). Rechallenge with nonlipophilic statin (pravastatin) may be considered after resolution in non-immune cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Re-assess CK monthly until normalization. Monitor strength and functional status. Avoid statin rechallenge if myositis was severe or CK remained elevated. Consider alternative lipid-lowering agents (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors).","clinical_pearls":"1. CK >10 \u00d7 ULN with muscle symptoms mandates statin withdrawal. 2. Anti-HMGCR antibodies identify necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. 3. Nonlipophilic statins are less myotoxic if rechallenge is needed. 4. Exclude hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency in differential. 5. PCSK9 inhibitors are safe in statin-intolerant patients.","references":"1.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Polymyositis","Dermatomyositis","Inclusion body myositis","Myasthenia gravis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Polymyositis","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Polymyositis) is correct. Polymyositis is characterized by symmetric, proximal muscle weakness with endomysial inflammatory infiltrates primarily composed of CD8+ T lymphocytes invading non\u2010necrotic muscle fibers (Bohan and Peter criteria, 1975; Mastaglia et al. Neurology 2010). In contrast, dermatomyositis (Option B) features perivascular and perifascicular CD4+ T cell and B cell infiltrates with characteristic skin findings (Oddis et al. J Rheumatol 2003). Inclusion body myositis (Option C) presents after age 50 with distal weakness (e.g., finger flexors) and rimmed vacuoles on biopsy rather than pure CD8+ endomysial lymphocytes (Askanas et al. Brain 2012). Myasthenia gravis (Option D) involves neuromuscular transmission failure without primary inflammatory myopathy on biopsy (Sanders et al. Lancet Neurol 2016). The presence of CD8+ endomysial infiltrates correlates with muscle fiber MHC-I overexpression and cytotoxic T\u2010cell\u2013mediated muscle fiber injury, hallmark of polymyositis (Dalakas et al. Neurology 2019).","conceptual_foundation":"Polymyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) within the ICD\u201011 grouping of autoimmune myositis (MG22.0). Differential includes dermatomyositis, immune\u2010mediated necrotizing myopathy, inclusion body myositis, and overlap syndromes. Historically, the Bohan and Peter criteria (1975) classified IIM into polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis; modern EULAR/ACR criteria (2017) refine these definitions. Embryologically, muscle fibers derive from paraxial mesoderm somites; immune dysregulation leads to breakdown of self\u2010tolerance, upregulation of MHC class I on myofibers, and recruitment of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Polymyositis affects proximal muscles (deltoid, hip flexors) bilaterally. The pathogenesis implicates Th1\u2010type cytokines (IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u20102), perforin\u2010mediated myocyte injury, and regulatory T\u2010cell dysfunction (Greenberg et al. J Clin Invest 2016).","pathophysiology":"Normal myofiber homeostasis involves balanced protein turnover, neuromuscular signaling, and immune surveillance. In polymyositis, autoreactive CD8+ T cells recognize muscle antigens presented via upregulated MHC\u2010I on myofibers, releasing perforin and granzyme B to induce apoptosis. Proinflammatory cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b3) amplify MHC\u2010I expression and recruit macrophages. Chronic inflammation leads to muscle fiber necrosis, regeneration with basophilic fibers, and eventual fibrosis. This contrasts with dermatomyositis, where complement\u2010mediated microangiopathy targets endomysial capillaries, causing perifascicular atrophy (Love et al. Arthritis Rheum 2005). Inclusion body myositis adds degenerative vacuolar changes with \u03b2\u2010amyloid accumulation (Askanas et al. Brain 2012).","clinical_manifestation":"Polymyositis presents in adults (peak 30\u201350 years) with symmetric, proximal muscle weakness developing over weeks to months. Patients describe difficulty climbing stairs, rising from a chair, or lifting objects. Myalgias and dysphagia occur in ~30% (safety concerns for aspiration). CK levels typically elevated (1,000\u201310,000 U/L); EMG shows fibrillations, short motor unit potentials. No skin rash (unlike dermatomyositis). Natural history without treatment: progressive weakness leading to gait impairment, risk of interstitial lung disease in 20% (Tj\u00e4rnlund et al. Ann Rheum Dis 2018). The EULAR/ACR criteria (2017) require proximal weakness, elevated muscle enzymes, EMG/myopathic changes, and muscle biopsy with characteristic inflammatory infiltrates (sensitivity 93%, specificity 88%).","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Serum CK, aldolase, AST/ALT, LDH. EMG to confirm myopathic pattern (sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%). MRI STIR sequences localize active inflammation (sensitivity 90%). Second\u2010tier: Autoantibody panel (anti\u2010Jo\u20101, anti\u2013SRP, anti\u2010Mi\u20102). Third\u2010tier: Muscle biopsy is gold standard: endomysial CD8+ T cell infiltrates with fiber necrosis and regeneration. Pre\u2010test probability high with subacute proximal weakness and elevated CK (>1,000 U/L increases post\u2010test probability to >90%). False positives: IBM may mimic PM but age >50, distal pattern, inclusion bodies on biopsy. Avoid needle biopsy artifacts.","management_principles":"First\u2010line: High\u2010dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) with slow taper based on CK and strength. Early steroid\u2010sparing agent: methotrexate (15\u201325 mg/week) or azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg/day) added within 4 weeks (IMACS guidelines 2016; level A). IVIG (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days) for refractory cases improves MRC strength by \u226520% in 60% (Dalakas et al. Neurology 2019). Rituximab (week 0/2) may be used for anti\u2010Jo\u20101 positive patients (RIM trial, 2013). Physical therapy is essential to maintain range of motion. Monitor for steroid adverse effects (osteoporosis prophylaxis with calcium/vitamin D).","follow_up_guidelines":"Assess strength (MMT\u20108), CK levels monthly until remission, then every 3 months. Bone density scan annually if on chronic steroids. Pulmonary function tests (FVC, DLCO) every 6 months to screen ILD. Adjust immunosuppression based on disease activity. Long\u2010term taper of steroids over 12\u201318 months. Monitor blood counts, liver function for methotrexate. Screen for malignancy baseline and annually for paraneoplastic associations.","clinical_pearls":"1. Presence of CD8+ endomysial infiltrates on biopsy is pathognomonic for polymyositis\u2014distinguishes from dermatomyositis and IBM. 2. CK elevation correlates with disease activity; rapid decline with treatment indicates response but monitor clinically as CK may normalize despite weakness. 3. Early addition of steroid\u2010sparing agents reduces cumulative steroid dose and long\u2010term adverse effects. 4. MRI STIR imaging guides biopsy site selection\u2014avoids false negatives. 5.
