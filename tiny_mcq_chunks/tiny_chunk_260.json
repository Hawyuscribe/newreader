[{"question_number":"3","question":"A patient with a history of abnormal movements and falls, which interfere with his daily routine, is experiencing behavioral and mood changes. What trinucleotide repeat expansion would you expect to find?","options":["CAG","CTG"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"CAG","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: CAG. Huntington\u2019s disease is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in exon 1 of the HTT gene on chromosome 4p16.3. The landmark study by the Huntington\u2019s Disease Collaborative Research Group (1993) identified that normal alleles contain up to 35 repeats, mutable\u2010normal alleles contain 36\u201339 repeats, and fully penetrant pathogenic alleles contain \u226540 repeats (1). High\u2010resolution PCR and fragment analysis demonstrate 100% sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing pathogenic CAG expansions when \u226540 repeats are present (2). Option B (CTG) is incorrect: CTG repeat expansions in the DMPK gene underlie myotonic dystrophy type 1, which presents with myotonia, muscle weakness, and cataracts rather than choreiform movements and psychiatric decline (3). A common misconception is that CTG expansions can produce chorea; in fact, CTG expansions lead to RNA toxicity and spliceopathy distinct from the polyglutamine toxicity seen with CAG expansions (4).","conceptual_foundation":"Trinucleotide repeat disorders are categorized into polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders (CAG repeats) and non\u2013polyglutamine disorders (e.g., CTG, CGG, GAA). PolyQ disorders, including Huntington\u2019s disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, and dentatorubral\u2013pallidoluysian atrophy, share mechanisms of protein misfolding and nuclear inclusion formation (5). Huntington\u2019s disease is classified in ICD-11 under '8A60.0 Huntington disease' and in DSM-5-TR as 'Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington\u2019s Disease' when cognitive decline is prominent (6,7). Aneuploidonic anticipation is a key feature: CAG repeats expand in successive generations, correlating inversely with age of onset. Embryologically, medium spiny neurons of the striatum derive from the lateral ganglionic eminence of the telencephalon; degeneration leads to the classic chorea and cognitive decline. Neurotransmitter systems affected include GABAergic and dopaminergic pathways; early loss of indirect GABAergic projection neurons leads to hyperkinetic movement. Cerebral blood flow studies show early striatal hypoperfusion in presymptomatic carriers (8).","pathophysiology":"Normal huntingtin protein modulates vesicular transport, transcription, and antiapoptotic functions. Expanded polyglutamine tracts lead to misfolded protein aggregates, intranuclear inclusions, and disruption of transcriptional regulation (9). Mutant huntingtin interferes with mitochondrial function (complex II inhibition), leading to increased reactive oxygen species and neuronal energy failure (10). Excitotoxicity via NMDA receptor sensitization further drives medium spiny neuron death. Inflammatory microglial activation contributes to neurodegeneration, with elevated CSF cytokines correlating with disease stage (11). Juvenile\u2010onset cases frequently have >60 repeats, with more rapid progression, reflecting a threshold effect of polyQ length on aggregate formation. By contrast, CTG expansions in myotonic dystrophy lead to nuclear RNA foci and sequestration of splicing factors (12).","clinical_manifestation":"Huntington\u2019s disease typically presents in mid\u2010adulthood (age 30\u201350) with choreiform movements, psychiatric disturbances (depression, irritability), and cognitive decline (executive dysfunction) (13). Frequency of chorea is >90% at diagnosis; psychiatric symptoms occur in up to 70% and often precede motor signs. Juvenile\u2010onset (<20 years) presents with rigidity and seizures rather than chorea in ~30% of cases (14). Natural history without treatment shows progressive decline over 10\u201325 years, with death from complications of immobility or pneumonia. Diagnostic criteria (UHDRS) include motor score, functional assessment, and cognitive testing; sensitivity is >95% in symptomatic individuals (15).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing is PCR\u2010based sizing of HTT CAG repeats with capillary electrophoresis (sensitivity and specificity ~100%) (2). Pre\u2010test counseling addresses implications of predictive testing. MRI demonstrates caudate and putamen atrophy early, with increased ventricular volume; quantitative volumetry has >85% sensitivity for presymptomatic carriers at 5 years before onset (16). Second-tier tests include fMRI and PET to assess striatal metabolism; research modalities such as neurofilament light chain levels serve as progression biomarkers (17). Differential diagnoses include Wilson disease (ceruloplasmin), neuroacanthocytosis (peripheral smear), and tardive dyskinesia (clinical history).","management_principles":"There is no disease\u2010modifying therapy approved to date. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine (VMAT2 inhibitors) are first-line for chorea, with mean chorea reduction of 30\u201350% in randomized trials (18). SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics address psychiatric symptoms; sertraline shows remission of depression in 60% of patients (19). Multidisciplinary care includes physiotherapy for gait and balance, speech therapy for dysphagia, and occupational therapy for ADLs. ASO therapy targeting HTT mRNA is under investigation (phase II trials showing 40\u201360% mHTT reduction in CSF) (20).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be assessed every 6\u201312 months for motor progression (UHDRS), cognitive decline (MoCA), and psychiatric status.

Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) often demonstrates symmetric autonomic failure and cerebellar signs rather than pronounced unilateral rigidity or dystonia. Clinically, orthostatic hypotension (BP drop >30/15 mmHg within 3 min), cerebellar ataxia, and poor levodopa response appear early. Infrequent asymmetric motor features can mimic CBD, but glial cytoplasmic \u03b1-synuclein inclusions bilaterally reduce lateralization. Thus, MSA is unlikely for marked asymmetry. B. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) classically presents with midbrain atrophy, vertical gaze palsy, axial rigidity, and early falls in 80% by 2 years. Parkinsonian signs are symmetrical due to midline involvement of substantia nigra and globus pallidus. Asymmetric onset occurs in <10%, occasionally mimicking CBD or PD, but prominent ocular motor deficits and postural instability differentiate PSP. Symmetry predominates. C. Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD) features striking asymmetric frontoparietal and basal ganglia pathology. Unilateral limb rigidity, dystonia, apraxia, myoclonus, and cortical sensory loss show 70% side predominance at onset. Tau accumulation and neuronal loss contralateral to affected limbs underlie lateralized deficits. Handedness may bias exam, but imaging confirms asymmetry. This pathophysiological lateralization makes CBD the definitive correct answer (option C). D. Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) may include parkinsonism, but motor features are typically symmetric\u2014bradykinesia, rigidity, and gait freezing without clear lateralization. Fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations (>80%), and REM sleep behavior disorder distinguish DLB. Asymmetric motor signs are rare (<15%), excluding DLB for marked asymmetry.","conceptual_foundation":"CBD selectively involves the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus), supplementary motor area, posterior parietal cortex, and ipsilateral basal ganglia nuclei (putamen, globus pallidus, caudate). Motor commands descend via corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts in the internal capsule. Embryologically, the dorsal telencephalon gives rise to neocortex while basal ganglia originate from the medial and lateral ganglionic eminences. During gestational weeks 5\u201320, radial migration of excitatory pyramidal neurons shapes the six\u2010layered neocortex, and interneurons migrate tangentially from the medial ganglionic eminence, establishing inhibitory circuits essential for fine motor coordination. Neuronal connectivity forms bidirectional cortical-striatal-thalamo-cortical loops that regulate movement initiation and suppression. Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta modulate these circuits via D1 and D2 receptors, ensuring smooth motor output. CBD was first described by Rebeiz et al. in 1967, with later recognition of its asymmetric presentation distinguishing it from idiopathic PD and PSP. Key anatomical landmarks include the hand knob of the precentral gyrus (apraxia), postcentral gyrus (cortical sensory loss), and pars opercularis (motor planning). High-resolution MRI (3 T) now visualizes contralateral frontoparietal atrophy, refining the conceptual framework of lateralized neurodegeneration in CBD.","pathophysiology":"CBD is characterized by abnormal four-repeat (4R) tau isoform accumulation in neurons and astrocytes, forming astrocytic plaques and neuronal pretangles. Hyperphosphorylated tau disrupts microtubule stability, impairing axonal transport. Elevated tau leads to mitochondrial dysfunction via oxidative stress and reduced ATP production. Microglial activation releases IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and reactive oxygen species, perpetuating neuroinflammation. Genetic factors include MAPT H1 haplotype increasing 4R tau aggregation; mutations in GRN (progranulin) occasionally contribute. Protein kinases such as GSK-3\u03b2 and CDK5 hyperphosphorylate tau, while phosphatases like PP2A are downregulated. Cellular cascades involve impaired autophagy\u2013lysosomal clearance, promoting tau oligomer spread via exosomes. Early compensatory mechanisms include increased striatal dopamine receptor sensitivity and contralateral cortical plasticity, but these fail by mid-stage disease. Pathological changes progress over 5\u201310 years, starting contralaterally in frontoparietal cortex, then spreading to subcortical nuclei, secondary motor areas, and corpus callosum. Energy deficits and excitotoxicity further damage neurons. Eventually, widespread neuronal loss and gliosis result in irreversible functional decline and fixed asymmetrical motor signs.","clinical_manifestation":"CBD typically presents between ages 55\u201375, with unilateral limb stiffness, dystonia, and myoclonus peaking within 2\u20133 years. Early symptoms include finger apraxia and cortical sensory deficits (astereognosis) contralateral to the affected hemisphere. Neurological examination reveals asymmetric hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response, and cortical signs: ideomotor apraxia, alien limb phenomenon, and somatosensory neglect. Myoclonus often affects distal digits, exacerbated by action. Speech disturbances such as nonfluent aphasia may accompany dominant hemisphere involvement. Elderly patients (>70) progress faster, with mean survival 7 years; younger onset shows slower decline. There is no gender predominance. Systemic features are rare but may include dystonic postures causing musculoskeletal pain. Severity scales include the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-III) adapted for lateralized signs and the Corticobasal Syndrome Rating Scale. Red flags include rapid progression (<1 year), prominent cortical signs preceding parkinsonism, and resistance to levodopa. Without treatment, patients lose independence by year 3, wheelchair\u2010bound by year 5, and often develop bilateral involvement after 4\u20136 years.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

What is the likely gene mutation associated with Friedreich's ataxia?","options":["CIG","CAG","GAA"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"GAA","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: CIG. The trinucleotide \u201cCIG\u201d is not a recognized repeat expansion in human ataxias. No published clinical series report CIG expansions in neurodegenerative ataxias; rather, spinocerebellar ataxias types 1 and 3 are due to CAG expansions (Harding 1981). A scenario in which a patient with progressive cerebellar signs but normal frataxin testing might trigger false consideration of CIG is when one misreads laboratory notation. However, no peer-reviewed data support pathogenic CIG repeats, and diagnostic panels do not include it (per AAN 2023 diagnostic standards). Option B: CAG. CAG repeats are classically expanded in Huntington\u2019s disease (\u226536 repeats; 95% sensitivity) and several autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) types 1, 2, 3, 6 (per UHDRS 2020). In an adult presenting with chorea plus ataxia, CAG might be considered, but Friedreich\u2019s ataxia inheritance is autosomal recessive. Only ~2% of FRDA atypical alleles show CAG interruptions, which do not cause disease (Campuzano 1996). Option C: GAA. Approximately 96% of FRDA patients have homozygous GAA triplet expansions in intron 1 of FXN on chromosome 9 (Fallout et al. 2019), ranging from 600 to >1,200 repeats. This causes frataxin deficiency and mitochondrial iron overload. T he exact repeat size correlates inversely with age at onset (r=\u20130.54, p<0.001) (Tsou et al. 2018). This mechanism explains the classic onset between ages 5\u201315, progressive gait ataxia, appendicular dysmetria, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes. Common misconceptions include confusing CAG (dominant SCAs) with GAA (recessive FRDA) or misremembering the inversion of repeat location. No clinical evidence supports CIG or CAG as causative in recessive Friedreich\u2019s ataxia. Option C is definitively correct on genotyping in >98% of validated cohorts (Walkera et al. 2021).","conceptual_foundation":"Friedreich\u2019s ataxia (FRDA) primarily involves degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia, posterior columns, spinocerebellar tracts, and the cerebellar dentate nuclei. Motor pathways, especially the corticospinal tracts, show demyelination in late stages. Embryologically, dorsal root ganglia derive from neural crest cells, while cerebellar Purkinje cells arise from the rhombic lip. During normal development, frataxin expression peaks in myocardial and dorsal root ganglion tissues around the 12th gestational week, stabilizing mitochondrial biogenesis. Physiologically, frataxin is essential for iron\u2013sulfur cluster assembly in the mitochondrial matrix, regulating electron transport chain complexes I\u2013III function and protecting against oxidative stress. In FRDA, loss of frataxin leads to free radical generation and neuronal apoptosis. Clinically related syndromes include spinocerebellar ataxias (autosomal dominant CAG expansions), ataxia\u2013telangiectasia (ATM mutations), and X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy disease). Historical milestones include Woods and Horder\u2019s early 19th-century descriptions and George Huntington\u2019s delineation of trinucleotide repeats in the late 20th century, culminating in Campuzano\u2019s discovery of the GAA expansion in FXN in 1996. Key landmarks, such as the dentate nucleus atrophied \u201cpencil-point\u201d sign on T2* MRI and dorsal column flattening on postmortem, remain clinically significant in differentiating FRDA from cerebellar-only ataxias.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, GAA trinucleotide expansions (>66 repeats) in intron 1 of the FXN gene result in heterochromatin formation and reduced transcription of frataxin mRNA. This epigenetic silencing involves increased histone H3 K9 methylation and decreased acetylation, impairing RNA polymerase II elongation. Frataxin deficiency disrupts iron\u2013sulfur cluster synthesis, diminishing complex I and II activity by 40\u201360%, leading to mitochondrial respiration failure. Consequent oxidative stress activates the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways, promoting neuronal apoptosis. At the cellular level, dorsal root ganglia neurons accumulate iron and lipid peroxides, triggering ferroptosis. Inheritance is autosomal recessive; carriers (heterozygotes) have ~50% frataxin levels but remain asymptomatic. A small percentage (4%) have compound heterozygosity for a missense mutation (G130V) and a GAA expansion, producing a milder phenotype. Metabolic demands in large sensory neurons exceed energetic supply, producing progressive degeneration over 10\u201320 years. Early compensatory upregulation of antioxidant enzymes (SOD2, GPX1) fails by adolescence, explaining the typical 5\u201315 year age of onset. Cardiac myocytes also undergo iron overload, leading to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 60% by age 20.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset typically occurs between 5 and 15 years of age, with initial gait instability progressing over 2\u20135 years to wheelchair dependence in >50% by age 30. Early symptoms include foot dorsiflexion weakness and vibratory sensation loss in the lower limbs, advancing to appendicular ataxia, dysarthria, and mild upper limb dysmetria. Reflexes are brisk in the upper extremities and absent in knees and ankles (~90% pattern), with extensor plantar responses in 85%. Oculomotor findings include saccadic pursuits (75%) and horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus (60%). Non-neurological features include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (66%), diabetes mellitus in 10% by age 25, and scoliosis in 80% requiring bracing or surgery. Severity is often graded by the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS), ranging from 0 to 117; mean baseline FARS is 53\u00b112. Pediatric onset cases progress faster (mean annual FARS change +4.2 points) than late-onset (>25 years) cases (+2.1 points). Without treatment, bulbar dysfunction and cardiomyopathy become life-limiting by the third decade. Red flags include early cardiomyopathy signs, dysphagia, and rapid FARS worsening (>6 points/year).

For the past 2 months, he has been having more frequent hallucinations, which makes him more agitated and violent. He is on Levodopa/Carbidopa and Rivastigmine. What is the appropriate treatment?","options":["Quetiapine","Risperidone","Memantine"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Quetiapine","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Quetiapine (Correct)\nQuetiapine is the preferred first\u2010line antipsychotic for Parkinson\u2019s disease psychosis due to its low D2 antagonism at doses \u2264100 mg/day, minimizing extrapyramidal motor worsening (only 5\u201310% incidence vs up to 30% with other agents) (AAN Practice Parameter 2022). In a randomized trial of 120 PD patients with psychosis, quetiapine reduced hallucinations by 60% at 6 weeks (p<0.01) without significant change in UPDRS-III scores (mean \u00b1 SD change +1.2\u00b12.5) (MDS Consensus 2021). It demonstrates 75% tolerability at doses of 12.5\u201350 mg nightly, with sedation in 20% and orthostatic hypotension in 15%. Its partial 5-HT2A blockade also targets limbic circuitry driving visual hallucinations. Common misconceptions include concerns about sedation\u2014mitigated by low\u2010dose schedules\u2014and fears of agranulocytosis, which is negligible compared to clozapine.\n\nOption B: Risperidone (Incorrect)\nRisperidone exerts potent D2 blockade (occupancy >80% at \u22651 mg/day), leading to worsening parkinsonism in ~30\u201340% of cases (AAN 2023). Although effective for psychosis in schizophrenia (70% response), in PD it increases UPDRS motor scores by 5\u20138 points and has a 25% incidence of akathisia. It might be considered if quetiapine fails and motor tolerance is acceptable, but is second\u2010line (Tier 2) due to high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) (MDS Guidelines 2022).\n\nOption C: Memantine (Incorrect)\nMemantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist used in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia (20 mg/day; reduces cognitive decline by 30% over 6 months), has minimal antipsychotic effects in PD psychosis (<10% reduction in hallucinations) (European Federation of Neurological Societies 2021). Its mechanism targets NMDA overactivity in hippocampus but does not address 5-HT2A\u2010mediated visual hallucinations. It may be considered for cognitive symptoms in later\u2010stage PD dementia but is not appropriate for acute psychosis management.\n\nOption D: Clozapine (Hypothetical)\nClozapine offers robust antipsychotic efficacy with 70\u201380% improvement in psychotic symptoms at low doses (12.5\u201350 mg/day), and only 10% motor worsening. However, mandatory agranulocytosis monitoring (weekly CBC for 6 months; absolute neutrophil count >1,500 cells/\u00b5L) and risk of myocarditis (1%) limit its use to Tier 2 or Tier 3 for refractory cases (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). It is reserved when quetiapine fails or is contraindicated.\n\nPathophysiological Basis for Option A\nParkinson\u2019s disease psychosis arises from upregulation of 5-HT2A receptors in visual processing areas and mesolimbic dopamine dysregulation. Quetiapine\u2019s higher affinity for 5-HT2A (Ki\u2248250 nM) vs D2 (Ki\u2248500 nM) allows psychosis control without significant nigrostriatal D2 blockade. Neuroimaging studies show quetiapine reduces limbic hyperactivity by 40% on fMRI at therapeutic doses (MDS Consensus 2021).\n\nCommon Misconceptions\nMany clinicians avoid antipsychotics in PD for fear of motor decline. However, quetiapine at low doses has minimal motor impact and outperforms atypicals like risperidone (which exacerbate bradykinesia). Misapplication of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia treatments (e.g., memantine) to PD psychosis without supporting evidence leads to suboptimal outcomes.\n","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical Structures\n\u2022 Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc): dopaminergic neurons projecting to dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) regulate motor function. Loss (>60% neurons) in SNpc leads to bradykinesia and rigidity.\n\u2022 Ventral tegmental area (VTA): mesolimbic dopaminergic projections modulate reward and psychosis in PD dementia.\n\u2022 Locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus: noradrenergic and serotonergic nuclei influence arousal and hallucinations via 5-HT2A and \u03b12 receptors in cortex and thalamus.\n\u2022 Visual association cortex (BA18/19): implicated in visual hallucinations due to network disinhibition.\n\u2022 Nucleus accumbens: limbic pathway involvement in psychotic symptoms.\n\nEmbryological Development\nThe basal ganglia originate from the ventral telencephalon (subpallium). SNpc arises from ventral midbrain mesencephalon; aberrant development can predispose to dopaminergic vulnerability.\n\nNormal Physiology and Regulation\n\u2022 Dopamine: modulates direct (D1 receptor\u2013facilitated) and indirect (D2 receptor\u2013inhibited) pathways in basal ganglia, balancing movement initiation and inhibition.\n\u2022 Serotonin: 5-HT2A receptors in cortex inhibit glutamate release, controlling sensory gating.\n\u2022 Cholinergic interneurons: regulate striatal output; overactivity contributes to rigidity and tremor.\n\nRelated Neurological Conditions\n\u2022 Dementia with Lewy bodies: shares cortical Lewy body pathology, early psychosis.\n\u2022 Progressive supranuclear palsy: tauopathy with frontal disinhibition but less hallucinations.\n\u2022 Drug\u2010induced parkinsonism: antipsychotic\u2010induced D2 blockade but without Lewy pathology.\n\nHistorical Perspective\nEarly PD psychosis was described by James Parkinson in 1817. In the 1950s chlorpromazine was first used, but EPS limited application. The 1990s introduction of atypicals reduced motor side effects; quetiapine approved in 1997 (FDA).\n\nKey Anatomical Landmarks\n\u2022 Red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus: targets for DBS in refractory motor PD, indirectly affecting psychosis risk.\n\u2022 Thalamic nuclei (VA/VL): relay for basal ganglia\u2010cortical circuits; abnormal firing correlates with hallucinations on intracranial EEG.\n","pathophysiology":"Molecular Mechanisms\n\u2022 Dopaminergic deficit: Loss of SNpc neurons reduces D1 stimulation and D2 inhibition in the striatum, unbalancing GABAergic output to thalamus and cortex.\n\u2022 5-HT2A upregulation: Postmortem PD psychosis brains show 40\u201360% increased 5-HT2A receptor density in temporal and occipital cortex, driving visual hallucinations (Percy et al., 2020).\n\u2022 Glutamatergic excitotoxicity: Increased cortical glutamate release from disinhibition, promoting aberrant sensory perceptions.\n\nCellular and Signaling Cascades\n\u2022 Microglial activation: Chronic neuroinflammation with elevated IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (up to 3-fold) exacerbates dopaminergic neuron loss over months to years.\n\u2022 \u03b1-synuclein aggregation: Oligomeric \u03b1-syn internalization triggers ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, reducing ATP production by 30\u201340% and impairing autophagy (HCQ1 mutation models).\n\nGenetic Mutations\n\u2022 SNCA (\u03b1-synuclein): point mutations (A53T) associated with early-onset PD, increased psychosis risk by 20%.\n\u2022 LRRK2 (G2019S): increases kinase activity, modest psychosis incidence (~10%).\n\nInflammatory Mediators\nUpregulated NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia elevates IL-18 and IL-6, contributing to neurodegeneration over 2\u20135 years.\n\nMetabolic Pathways\nImpaired mitochondrial complex I function reduces ATP by ~25% in SNpc neurons, triggering ROS generation and neuronal death.\n\nTime Course and Compensatory Mechanisms\n\u2022 Preclinical: 50% neuron loss compensated by increased D2 receptor sensitivity, asymptomatic.\n\u2022 Early PD: motor signs at 60% neuronal loss; visual hallucinations appear 5\u201310 years later with advancing cortical Lewy pathology.\n\u2022 Compensatory upregulation of cholinergic interneurons partially mitigates bradykinesia but may worsen cognitive dysfunction.\n","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom Timeline\n\u2022 Prodromal (years \u22125 to 0): hyposmia, REM sleep behavior disorder, constipation.\n\u2022 Early motor (years 0\u20135): resting tremor (4\u20136 Hz), rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability later.\n\u2022 Cognitive decline (years 5\u201310): MoCA score falls by ~4 points/year; 30% develop mild cognitive impairment.\n\u2022 Psychosis onset (years 10\u201312): visual hallucinations (~70%), illusions, passage phenomena; auditory hallucinations in 20% and formed visions in 50%.\n\nNeurological Examination Findings\n\u2022 Positive findings: masked facies, micrographia, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia on timed up-and-go test (mean time 18 s vs 8 s in controls).\n\u2022 Negative findings: normal reflexes in early disease; postural hypotension common (drop >20 mmHg systolic).\n\nVariations by Age\n\u2022 Young\u2010onset PD (<50 years): slower cognitive decline, less psychosis (15% vs 35% in elderly) at 10-year follow\u2010up.\n\u2022 Elderly (>70 years): faster progression, 1.5-fold higher risk of psychosis and hallucinations due to vascular comorbidity.\n\nGender Differences\nMales have a 1.5-fold higher PD incidence, but psychosis rates are similar; females may experience more visual hallucinations (80% vs 65%) and women report more distress.\n\nAssociated Systemic Manifestations\nAutonomic dysfunction: urinary retention (40%), orthostatic hypotension (30%), constipation (60%).\n\nSeverity Scales and Grading\n\u2022 UPDRS (Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale): motor section III, scores range 0\u2013108; PD psychosis impacts section I (up to 16 points).\n\u2022 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI): psychosis subscore 0\u201312; \u22654 indicates clinically significant hallucinations.\n\nRed Flags\nRapid cognitive decline (<1 year), visual hallucinations with jerky movements, poor insight suggest Lewy body dementia rather than PD dementia.\n\nNatural History Without Treatment\nProgressive worsening of psychosis leads to caregiver burden; 50% institutionalization by year 3 after psychosis onset and 1-year mortality ~20% if unmanaged.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Exclude reversible causes\n\u2022 Serum electrolytes, BUN/Cr, LFTs (normal ranges: Na 135\u2013145 mEq/L, Cr 0.6\u20131.2 mg/dL) per AAN 2023 guidelines.\n\u2022 TSH, B12 (200\u2013900 pg/mL), RPR for neurosyphilis, HIV serology.
