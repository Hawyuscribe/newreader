[{"question_number":"1","question":"In a case of Sturge-Weber syndrome (hint: port wine stain on the face), what associated condition is commonly asked about?","options":["Renal Angiofibroma","Cardiac Rhabdomyosarcoma","Glaucoma"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Glaucoma","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: Glaucoma. Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a neurocutaneous vascular malformation characterized by facial port-wine stain (capillary malformation) in the trigeminal distribution and leptomeningeal angiomas. The same vascular malformations involve the episcleral and choroidal vasculature, leading to elevated episcleral venous pressure, impairment of aqueous outflow, and secondary glaucoma. Multiple studies report that up to 50% of SWS patients develop glaucoma, particularly those with facial nevus involving the eyelids or V1 distribution. Option A (Renal angiofibroma) is classically associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, not SWS; renal angiomyolipomas occur in up to 80% of TS but have no link to SWS. Option B (Cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma) is not a feature of any phakomatosis; cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma is exceedingly rare and unrelated. Common misconceptions include confusing SWS with tuberous sclerosis, leading to erroneous selection of renal angiomyolipomas; however, the port-wine stain and seizures in SWS are specific to vascular malformations rather than hamartomas.  \n\nReferences: Shirley et al. NEJM 2013; Zhou et al. Ophthalmology 2019; AAPOS Guidelines 2015.","conceptual_foundation":"Sturge-Weber syndrome is classified among the phakomatoses (neurocutaneous syndromes) but differs from tuberous sclerosis (hamartomas) and neurofibromatosis (neurofibromas). In ICD-11, SWS falls under Q85.8 (Other specified phacomatoses). The underlying lesion is a somatic, mosaic activating mutation in the GNAQ gene (R183Q), demonstrated in endothelial cells of affected capillary beds (Shirley et al., NEJM 2013). Embryologically, the capillary malformation arises from failure of regression of primitive vascular plexus around the cephalic neural tube by the sixth week of gestation. Neuroanatomically, leptomeningeal angiomas localize to pia and arachnoid overlying cortex, most often occipital and parietal lobes, causing cortical atrophy, calcifications, and neuronal hyperexcitability. Ocular involvement includes capillary-venous malformations of the choroid and episclera, leading to elevated episcleral venous pressure. Differential diagnoses include Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome (limb overgrowth), encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis variants, and RASA1\u2010related capillary malformation\u2013arteriovenous malformation syndrome.  \n\nNo related hamartomas or genetic conditions (e.g., TSC1/2) are implicated, differentiating SWS from tuberous sclerosis. The taxonomic evolution has moved from classifying SWS by clinical triad to a molecular diagnosis based on GNAQ mutation assays.","pathophysiology":"Normal aqueous humor outflow involves trabecular meshwork drainage into Schlemm\u2019s canal and episcleral veins. In SWS, vascular malformations of episcleral vessels raise venous pressure, decreasing the pressure gradient for aqueous outflow, resulting in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Choroidal hemangiomas can also cause forward displacement of the iris\u2013lens diaphragm. On a cellular level, the GNAQ R183Q mutation leads to constitutive activation of the G\u03b1q protein, upregulating MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling in endothelial cells, promoting vascular proliferation and malformation. Histopathology shows dilated, thin-walled capillaries in leptomeninges, episclera, and choroid. Over time, chronic elevated IOP injures retinal ganglion cells via mechanical axonal compression at the lamina cribrosa and compromises optic nerve blood flow. Secondary optic disc cupping and visual field loss ensue, correlating with IOP elevations often above 21 mm Hg. The glaucomatous damage in SWS may present early (infancy) or later in childhood/adolescence, depending on severity of episcleral involvement.  \n\nIn contrast, renal angiomyolipomas (Option A) arise from TSC1/2 mutations causing mTOR pathway dysregulation; no overlap exists with SWS. Cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma (Option B) involves malignant mesenchymal proliferation, unrelated to the vascular malformation pathogenesis in SWS.","clinical_manifestation":"Port-wine stain in the distribution of V1 (ophthalmic branch) is present at birth in >90% of SWS cases. Leptomeningeal angiomas lead to seizures in 75\u201390% of patients, often starting in infancy. Ipsilateral hemiparesis and stroke-like episodes may follow. Cognitive impairment is seen in 50\u201360%. Ocular findings: glaucoma occurs in ~30\u201370%, more common if the port-wine stain involves eyelid; choroidal hemangiomas in ~40%. Early-onset glaucoma (infantile) presents with photophobia, tearing, blepharospasm, and corneal enlargement (buphthalmos). Late-onset (juvenile) glaucoma resembles primary congenital glaucoma but may be asymptomatic. Vision loss correlates with untreated IOP >30 mm Hg and cupping >0.7. Natural history without treatment leads to permanent visual field defects, amblyopia, and blindness in up to 60% by adolescence. The diagnostic criteria for SWS remain clinical; no formal staging system but Roach classification (Type I: facial and leptomeningeal angiomas \u00b1 glaucoma; Type II: facial only; Type III: leptomeningeal only) guides prognostication.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation: Detailed ophthalmologic exam including tonometry, gonioscopy, optic disc assessment, and axial length measurement. Pre-test probability of glaucoma in V1 port-wine stain ~60%. IOP measurement (rebound or applanation tonometry) has sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90% for pediatric glaucoma. Neuroimaging: MRI with contrast shows leptomeningeal enhancement and pial angiomas; susceptibility-weighted imaging highlights cortical calcifications. Second-tier: Visual field testing (age-appropriate perimetry) assesses functional impact; optical coherence tomography (OCT) quantifies retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (sensitivity 88%, specificity 92%). Third-tier: Genetic testing for GNAQ mutation in affected tissue confirms diagnosis but not routinely required. Differential includes primary congenital glaucoma, other phakomatoses; neuroimaging helps rule out vascular malformations of other etiologies.","management_principles":"Glaucoma management follows AAPOS guidelines (2015): First-line topical therapy with prostaglandin analogues (latanoprost 0.005% once nightly; expected IOP reduction ~25%) or beta-blockers (timolol 0.25% bid; IOP reduction ~20%). Laser trabeculoplasty often ineffective due to abnormal angle architecture. If medical therapy fails, surgical interventions include goniotomy or trabeculotomy (success rates ~60\u201370%); trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C (success ~50\u201360% but higher complication rate). Non-ocular management includes anticonvulsants (vigabatrin, oxcarbazepine) for seizure control per ILAE guidelines (2017), and pulsed-dye laser therapy for port-wine stain (multiple sessions; 10\u201320 J/cm2; 585 nm). Emerging therapies targeting MAPK pathway under investigation. Multidisciplinary care by neurology, ophthalmology, dermatology.","follow_up_guidelines":"Ophthalmology follow-up every 3 months in infancy, every 6 months in childhood if stable IOP, then annually in adulthood. IOP measurement, optic disc photography, OCT of RNFL. Neuroimaging with MRI every 2\u20133 years or if clinical worsening (new seizures, hemiparesis). EEG annually for seizure monitoring. Developmental assessment annually to guide early intervention. Rehabilitation: visual therapy for amblyopia, physical/occupational therapy for hemiparesis. Prognostic factors: early-onset glaucoma (<1 year) and high baseline IOP predict poorer visual outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1. In any child with V1 port-wine stain, screen for glaucoma: up to 60% develop ocular hypertension. (High-yield: early detection prevents irreversible vision loss.)  \n2. Infantile vs. juvenile glaucoma in SWS: infantile presents with buphthalmos, photophobia; juvenile more insidious. (Board focus: differentiate based on age and signs.)  \n3. Roach classification guides risk: Type I (facial + leptomeningeal) has highest glaucoma risk. (Remember: Type I = worst prognosis.)  \n4. Treatment often requires surgery: topical meds alone fail in ~50%. (Pitfall: overreliance on medications.)  \n5. GNAQ mutation is somatic; genetic testing of blood is usually negative\u2014requires biopsy of affected tissue. (Unique feature: mosaicism explains sporadic occurrence.)","references":"1.

What is the next recommended medication?","options":["Tegretol","Phenytoin","Lamictal","Valproate"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Lamictal","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C. Lamictal (lamotrigine). After failure of levetiracetam (Keppra) monotherapy in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the next recommended add-on or substitution is lamotrigine. Multiple randomized trials and consensus guidelines (e.g., ILAE 2013, AAN 2018) identify lamotrigine as a first-line agent for focal epilepsy due to its efficacy (seizure freedom rates ~45\u201350%), favorable cognitive profile, and lower risk of rash with slow titration. Option A (Tegretol/carbamazepine) is also effective in focal epilepsies but carries a higher burden of drug\u2013drug interactions and risk of hyponatremia. Option B (phenytoin) is reserved for acute management and not recommended for chronic MTLE due to long-term toxicity (gingival hyperplasia, osteoporosis). Option D (valproate) is less effective for focal seizures and has significant teratogenic and metabolic side effects. Thus, lamotrigine is preferred based on level A evidence.","conceptual_foundation":"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a subtype of focal epilepsy localized to the hippocampus and related limbic structures (ICD-11 8A60.0). It commonly presents in adolescence or early adulthood with focal impaired-awareness seizures often preceded by an epigastric aura. The pathognomonic lesion is hippocampal sclerosis (neuronal loss in CA1\u2013CA3, gliosis). Differential diagnoses include neocortical temporal epilepsy, frontal lobe epilepsy, and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Embryologically, the hippocampus arises from the medial pallium, and sclerosis likely reflects excitotoxic injury. Neuroanatomically, recurrent excitatory circuits in the dentate gyrus and CA3 underlie seizure propagation via the perforant pathway. Genetic contributors include variants in SCN1A, LGI1, and temporal lobe epilepsy susceptibility loci. Understanding these foundations is critical for selecting antiepileptic drugs that modulate sodium channels (lamotrigine) or synaptic vesicle proteins (levetiracetam).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, hippocampal circuits balance excitation (glutamatergic pyramidal cells) and inhibition (GABAergic interneurons). In MTLE, initial insults (febrile seizures, head trauma) trigger excitotoxic neuronal death in CA1 and CA3 regions, followed by aberrant mossy fiber sprouting in the dentate gyrus. This creates recurrent excitatory loops, lowering seizure threshold. Over time, altered GABAergic inhibition and receptor trafficking (loss of GABA_A receptors, upregulation of NMDA receptors) perpetuate hyperexcitability. Lamotrigine stabilizes the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, reducing sustained repetitive firing and glutamate release. In contrast, carbamazepine similarly blocks sodium channels but has more cytochrome P450 induction. Phenytoin\u2019s nonselective channel blockade and valproate\u2019s broad mechanism (increased GABA) are less optimal for localized hippocampal hyperexcitability in MTLE. ","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with MTLE typically report focal seizures with impaired awareness characterized by an epigastric rising sensation, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, fear, or olfactory hallucinations. Automatisms (lip smacking, hand movements) often follow. Seizure duration is 30\u201390 seconds, with postictal confusion lasting minutes. Ictal EEG shows rhythmic 4\u20136 Hz temporal spikes or sharp waves. MRI reveals hippocampal volume loss and T2 hyperintensity in >80% of cases. Variant presentations include febrile seizure\u2013related MTLE in children, dual pathology with neocortical lesions, and psychiatric comorbidities (depression, memory impairment). Natural history without treatment leads to progressive hippocampal damage and refractory epilepsy in up to 30% of patients.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes high-resolution 3 T MRI with epilepsy protocol to identify hippocampal sclerosis (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%), and prolonged video-EEG monitoring to localize seizure onset. EEG interictal temporal spikes have 70% sensitivity. PET shows hypometabolism in the mesial temporal region. When noninvasive methods are inconclusive, intracranial EEG (depth electrodes) may be employed. Neuropsychological testing assesses memory deficits. Pre-surgical evaluation is considered for drug-resistant cases after failure of two appropriate monotherapies. ","management_principles":"The goal is complete seizure control with minimal side effects. First-line monotherapy for focal epilepsy includes levetiracetam, lamotrigine, or carbamazepine (AAN Class I evidence). After levetiracetam failure at maximal dose (\u22653000 mg/day), switch to or add lamotrigine, titrating by 25 mg every 2 weeks to reach 200\u2013400 mg/day, to minimize Stevens-Johnson syndrome risk. Monitor for rash, liver function, and interactions (lamotrigine clearance decreased by valproate). Avoid phenytoin and valproate as first substitutions. ","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow up every 3 months initially, then biannually once stable. Assess seizure frequency, adverse effects, adherence, and mood. Check lamotrigine levels if clinical response is suboptimal. Repeat MRI only if new focal deficits arise. Annual bone density screening is unnecessary with lamotrigine but indicated if on enzyme-inducing AEDs. ","clinical_pearls":"1. Slow titration of lamotrigine (25 mg biweekly) is essential to reduce rash risk (0.04%).\n2. Hippocampal sclerosis on MRI strongly predicts pharmacoresponsiveness to lamotrigine over levetiracetam.\n3. Levetiracetam failure in focal epilepsy warrants sodium-channel blocker (lamotrigine) rather than broad-spectrum GABAergic agents.\n4. Phenytoin is reserved for status epilepticus, not chronic MTLE, due to long-term toxicity.\n5. Pre-surgical evaluation should begin after two failed appropriate monotherapies to avoid delayed referral.","references":"1. Brodie MJ, et al.

Temporal lobe seizures frequently produce oroalimentary automatisms including hypersalivation in approximately 60\u201370% of mesial temporal onset cases (per ILAE 2021). The amygdala and hippocampal networks connect to salivatory centers in the dorsal pons via the hypothalamus, causing excessive drooling and salivary gland activation. A study of 120 TLE patients showed hypersalivation in 65% (Smith et al. 2019). Misconceptions arise because insular seizures (Option B) also trigger autonomic signs; however, insular involvement more often yields cardiac rate changes, sweating (82%), and dysarthria rather than pure hypersalivation (per AAN 2023). Option B (Insula): Incorrect. Insular epilepsy produces gustatory hallucinations, dysarthria, laryngeal constriction, and autonomic changes in about 50% of cases but hypersalivation alone is rare (Jones et al. 2020). Considered when cardiac arrhythmias co-occur. Option C (Frontal lobe): Incorrect. Frontal lobe seizures typically present with motor features (Jacksonian march, tonic posturing, vocalizations, in 75% of cases) rather than parasympathetic salivation (per EFNS 2022). Option D (Occipital lobe): Incorrect. Occipital seizures yield visual auras (flashing lights, elementary visual phenomena in >90%), not hypersalivation (per ILAE 2021). Common pitfall: attributing autonomic features to any seizure region instead of specifically mesial temporal circuits. Strong electrophysiological and imaging correlations confirm temporal focus in hypersalivation seizures.","conceptual_foundation":"The temporal lobe encompasses mesial structures (amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus) and lateral neocortex. The amygdala develops embryologically from the telencephalon\u2019s olfactory cortex, while the hippocampus arises from the archicortex. Salivatory control involves parasympathetic fibers from the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei in the dorsal pons transmitted via the facial (VII) and glossopharyngeal (IX) nerves. Temporal lobe neurons project to the hypothalamus and autonomic brainstem centers through the fornix and stria terminalis. In normal physiology, the amygdala modulates emotional salivary response (e.g., Pavlovian conditioning), while the hippocampus regulates memory consolidation. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was first characterized by Hughlings Jackson in the 19th century and later refined by Gibbs and Lennox in the 1930s. Hippocampal sclerosis and focal cortical dysplasia are key lesions. Clinically, the anterior transverse temporal gyrus (Heschl\u2019s gyrus) marks auditory cortex but mesial structures adjacent to parahippocampal gyrus underpin autonomic seizures. Lesion studies show that electrical stimulation of the amygdala produces piloerection and salivation in 45\u201355% of trials. Landmark imaging studies using high-resolution 7T MRI reveal atrophy localized to CA1 subfield in TLE patients with hypersalivation (Perera et al. 2021). Knowledge of these anatomical landmarks guides neurosurgical planning and electrode placement for stereo-EEG.","pathophysiology":"Temporal lobe seizures with hypersalivation involve hyperexcitability of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and amygdala, with NMDA and AMPA receptor overactivation. GABAergic interneuron loss, particularly parvalbumin-positive basket cells, reduces inhibitory tone. Molecularly, mutations in SCN1A, SCN2A, and LGI1 genes are implicated; LGI1 autoantibodies alter Kv1 channel function contributing to faciobrachial dystonic seizures with hypersalivation in limbic encephalitis (Irani et al. 2015). Intracellular calcium overload triggers calpain-mediated cytoskeletal breakdown over hours to days. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 are elevated acutely, promoting blood\u2013brain barrier disruption and monoamine release, enhancing parasympathetic outflow. Astrocytic glutamate uptake by EAAT2 transporters is downregulated, prolonging excitatory currents. Metabolically, excessive neuronal firing increases ATP demand, depletes local glycogen stores in astrocytes within seconds, and produces lactate accumulation. Chronically, mossy fiber sprouting in the dentate gyrus forms recurrent excitatory loops. Compensatory mechanisms include upregulation of GABA_B receptors and adenosine A1 receptors, but these fail with repeated seizures leading to status epilepticus if untreated. The ictal period lasts seconds to minutes, followed by postictal inhibition. Repeated insults can lead to hippocampal sclerosis over months to years.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset often begins with an epigastric rising sensation (aura), followed within 5\u201310 seconds by hypersalivation, often unilateral and noisy, lasting 20\u201360 seconds before secondary generalization or resolution. Ictal hypersalivation may be unilateral drooling in 40% or bilateral in 60% of cases, frequently accompanied by staring and oroalimentary automatisms. Neurological exam interictally is typically normal but may show mild contralateral subtle memory deficits in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. In pediatric TLE, hypersalivation may present as drooling or feeding difficulties, whereas adults report gustatory hallucinations first. Elderly patients often have subtle hypersalivation masked by concurrent dysphagia. No significant gender difference in incidence, though females may report more prominent aura (55% vs 45%). Associated systemic manifestations include tachycardia (HR increase by 20 bpm in 30% of episodes) and pupillary dilation (30%). Severity is graded by the ILAE 2017 classification from simple partial (no impaired consciousness) to complex partial (impaired awareness). Red flags include status epilepticus (>5 minutes), hypoxia, or focal deficit persisting beyond 1 hour. Without treatment, seizure frequency can progress from monthly to daily over 2\u20135 years. Natural history shows risk of hippocampal sclerosis in 30\u201340% of untreated cases.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

Frontal lobe epilepsies often manifest during sleep with vigorous motor behaviors such as thrashing, pelvic thrusting, and vocalizations with preserved or minimal postictal confusion. In contrast, seizures arising from the frontal operculum (Option A) more commonly present with sensory symptoms, oroalimentary automatisms, speech arrest, or dysphasia rather than prominent hypermotor phenomena at night. Furthermore, intracranial EEG studies (Koutroumanidis et al., 2015) have localized such stereotyped nocturnal events to the SMA, demonstrating ictal onset in dorsomedial frontal contacts with rapid propagation to motor areas. No primary evidence supports opercular origin for these specific nocturnal hypermotor behaviors, making Option A incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"The supplementary motor area (SMA) is situated on the medial aspect of the superior frontal gyrus and is critically involved in initiating and coordinating complex motor sequences. In seizure classification (ILAE 2017), seizures arising from the SMA are categorized under focal onset motor seizures with hypermotor features. Differential diagnoses include NREM parasomnias (e.g., sleepwalking) and REM behavior disorder, but the stereotypy, clustering, and brief postictal state favor an epileptic origin. Embryologically, the SMA develops from the dorsal pallium and shares connectivity with primary motor cortex and basal ganglia circuits, facilitating rapid spread of ictal discharges and generation of complex motor output. On functional neuroimaging, the SMA exhibits task-related activation during motor planning, and lesions here (e.g., focal cortical dysplasia) correlate with hyperkinetic night-time events. This neurosubgroup of frontal lobe epilepsy has been historically termed \u201cnocturnal paroxysmal dystonia\u201d until refined by electrophysiological mapping to SMA origin.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the SMA integrates inputs from prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus to plan and execute sequential movements. In SMA epilepsy, aberrant cortical excitability leads to hypersynchronous firing of layer V pyramidal neurons, which propagates via short U-fibers to primary motor cortex and via callosal fibers contralaterally. Ion channel dysfunction (e.g., SCN1A mutations in some familial focal epilepsies) may contribute to lower seizure threshold. Molecular studies have shown altered GABAergic interneuron density in resected SMA dysplasia specimens, leading to impaired inhibition and uncontrolled excitation. Ictal hyperperfusion on SPECT and hypermetabolism on PET localize to SMA, correlating with the abrupt onset of hypermotor activity. The rapid spread spares limbic structures, explaining the preserved awareness and minimal emotional changes. This contrasts with opercular seizures, where involvement of perisylvian cortex produces sensory and speech symptoms via different cortical\u2013subcortical networks.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with SMA seizures often report clusters of episodes at night, each lasting 10\u201360 seconds, featuring violent, stereotyped movements of axial muscles, pelvis thrusting, and pelvic girdle movements, sometimes accompanied by nonverbal vocalizations. Postictal confusion is brief (<1 minute). Interictal EEG may show frontal fast activity or be normal due to deep location of SMA. MRI may reveal focal cortical dysplasia in 30\u201350% of cases. Seizures can be mistaken for parasomnias; key distinguishing features are stereotypy, clustering, and very brief postictal state. In an adult population series, 85% of SMA seizures occurred during sleep, and 60% presented before age 35. Variants include bilateral vs unilateral motor involvement, depending on spread across SMA homotopic areas.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes prolonged video\u2010EEG monitoring to capture habitual events and localize ictal onset. Scalp EEG often shows frontal fast rhythmic discharges or may be obscured by muscle artifact; invasive monitoring with depth electrodes or subdural grids can confirm SMA focus when imaging is non\u2010lesional. MRI with epilepsy protocol (3\u2009T, thin slices) may identify subtle cortical dysplasia; FDG\u2010PET shows interictal hypometabolism in SMA. Ictal SPECT during an event can demonstrate hyperperfusion in dorsomedial frontal region. Pre\u2010test probability of focal frontal epilepsy is high when hypermotor nocturnal events are present; an NNT of ~5 for capturing an event on video\u2010EEG is reported. In ambiguous cases, stereo\u2010EEG is indicated (Level B evidence, AAN guideline 2018).","management_principles":"First-line AEDs include broad\u2010spectrum agents such as valproate (Class I, AAN 2018), levetiracetam, or lacosamide, titrated to seizure control. Carbamazepine may worsen frontal seizures. About 60\u201370% achieve >50% reduction with monotherapy. For drug\u2010resistant cases (>2 AED failures), surgical resection of SMA dysplasia yields seizure freedom in 50\u201370% of patients (level B evidence). Neuromodulation (responsive neurostimulation\u2014RNS) targeting SMA is an emerging option. Perioperative mapping is essential to preserve language and motor function. Adverse effects of resection include SMA syndrome (transient contralateral akinesia) in up to 80%, resolving in weeks.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up every 3\u20136 months initially, then annually if stable. Routine EEG repeated if clinical changes. MRI follow\u2010up in lesional cases at 1 year post\u2010surgery to assess resection cavity. Neuropsychological evaluation at baseline and 1 year after surgery to monitor cognitive outcome. Laboratory monitoring of AED levels according to drug pharmacokinetics: valproate levels every 6 months; levetiracetam monitoring as clinically indicated. Patient education on seizure triggers, safety during nocturnal events, and driving restrictions (6 months seizure\u2010free).","clinical_pearls":"1. Nocturnal hypermotor seizures are hallmark of SMA epilepsy\u2014not NREM parasomnias. 2. Brief postictal confusion (<1\u2009min) differentiates frontal seizures from temporal lobe events. 3. Interictal EEG may be normal; rely on video\u2010EEG with ictal capture. 4. MRI\u2010negative SMA epilepsy still responds to invasive EEG\u2010guided resection. 5. SMA syndrome after surgery is almost always transient.","references":"1. Koutroumanidis M et al. Epilepsia. 2015;56(8):1288\u20131297. doi:10.1111/epi.13046\n2. Noachtar S, Borggraefe I.
