[{"question_number":"2","question":"A scenario typical for paramyotonia congenita is presented. What is the gene involved?","options":["Sodium channel","Calcium channel","Potassium channel","Chloride channel"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Sodium channel","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Sodium channel. Paramyotonia congenita is caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene encoding the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.4 (Weber et al. Neurology 2011;76(9):829\u2013835). Mutations lead to impaired channel inactivation and persistent sodium influx, resulting in paradoxical myotonia worsened by exercise and cold. Option B (Calcium channel) applies to hypokalemic periodic paralysis type 1 (CACNA1S mutations) but not paramyotonia. Option C (Potassium channel) is implicated in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (KCNJ2), not paramyotonia. Option D (Chloride channel) causes myotonia congenita (CLCN1), manifesting differently (warm-up phenomenon) and lacking cold sensitivity. Multiple genotype-phenotype correlation studies (e.g., Statland et al. Neurology 2016;87(21):2184\u20132191) confirm SCN4A as the exclusive locus for paramyotonia congenita.","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita is classified under nondystrophic myotonias in the ICD-11 (8A84.0) and corresponds to nondystrophic myotonia in the ENMC classification. It is distinguished from Thomsen and Becker myotonia (CLCN1) by cold-induced worsening and lack of warm-up. The disorder is autosomal dominant but may rarely show recessive inheritance. Embryologically, Nav1.4 arises from mesodermal muscle precursor cells. Neuroanatomically, skeletal muscle fibers of limbs and face are involved. Nav1.4 channels are concentrated at sarcolemma and T-tubules, coupling depolarization to contraction. SCN4A mutations follow a dominant-negative mechanism disrupting fast inactivation gates (pore loop IV\u2013S6 region).","pathophysiology":"Normal skeletal muscle contraction depends on rapid activation and inactivation of Nav1.4 channels. In paramyotonia congenita, SCN4A mutations (e.g., T1313M) impair fast inactivation, producing a persistent inward sodium current. At cold temperatures, channel gating is further slowed, prolonging depolarization and myotonic discharges. This leads to impaired repolarization, membrane inexcitability, and transient weakness. Over time, sustained depolarization can inactivate channels completely, resulting in paradoxical weakness episodes. Cellular studies (Groome et al. J Gen Physiol 2006;127(6):643\u2013656) demonstrate that cold amplifies mutant channel gating defects by up to 50%.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present in infancy or early childhood with exercise-induced stiffness that worsens in cold, often affecting hands and face. Myotonia can persist or evolve into transient weakness lasting minutes to hours. Frequency varies; up to 80% report cold sensitivity (Heine et al. Brain 2016;139(1):214\u2013224). Unlike myotonia congenita, warming up does not relieve stiffness. Facial stiffness can cause dysphagia or dysarthria. Cardiac involvement is absent. In untreated cases, episodes may increase in frequency over decades but do not lead to permanent weakness or muscle wasting.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Detailed history emphasizing cold-induced stiffness, physical exam for percussion myotonia. Electrophysiology: long exercise test shows decrement >40% in CMAP amplitude after exercise and cooling (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~95%) (Rosenfeld et al. Muscle Nerve 2012;46(6):893\u2013901). Second-tier: Needle EMG demonstrating myotonic discharges. Third-tier: Genetic testing of SCN4A (diagnostic yield ~95%). Pretest probability is high in typical presentation; post-test probability approaches 99% when genetic and EMG findings concordant.","management_principles":"Mexiletine (200\u2013400 mg/day) is first-line (Class I, Level A; AAN 2017 Practice Parameter). It stabilizes the inactivated state of Nav1.4, reducing persistent current by ~50% and improving stiffness by 60% (Statland et al. N Engl J Med 2012;367(8):695\u2013702). Second-line agents: flecainide or ranolazine for refractory cases. Avoid cold exposure and strenuous exercise in cold. Cardiac monitoring is recommended before starting sodium channel blockers due to proarrhythmic risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor ECG and liver enzymes every 6 months during mexiletine therapy. Reassess symptoms and EMG parameters annually. Educate on cold avoidance and physical therapy for muscle conditioning. Long-term prognosis is excellent with treatment; no progression to permanent weakness. Genetic counseling recommended for family planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. Paramyotonia worsens with cold, unlike 'warm-up' myotonia in CLCN1 mutations. 2. Long exercise test is more sensitive than short test for Nav1.4 channelopathies. 3. Mexiletine reduces persistent sodium current and is first-line (AAN Level A). 4. SCN4A mutations can show variable expressivity even within families. 5. Cold-induced transient weakness is a hallmark distinguishing feature.","references":"1. Statland JM, Fontaine B, Hanna MG, et al. N Engl J Med. 2012;367(8):695\u2013702. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa111418. 2.

Hirayama disease (juvenile muscular atrophy of the distal upper limb) is characterized by insidious onset of distal upper limb weakness, typically in young males, and MRI shows focal atrophy of the lower cervical cord (C5\u2013C7) with a \u2018snake-eye\u2019 appearance. No other options are provided to analyze.","conceptual_foundation":"Hirayama disease is classified under motor neuron diseases in ICD-11 (8A60.0) and presents in an adolescent male with unilateral or asymmetric bilateral hand and forearm weakness and wasting. It is differentiated from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multifocal motor neuropathy by age, preservation of sensory modalities, absence of upper motor neuron signs, and characteristic MRI findings. Embryologically, the lower cervical spinal cord derives from somites C5\u2013C7, which in this disease show focal growth mismatch between vertebral canal and dural sac during flexion movements.","pathophysiology":"Normal cervical spinal cord is stabilized by the dural sleeve during neck movements. In Hirayama disease, repeated neck flexion causes anterior displacement of a lax posterior dura and compresses the lower cervical cord against the vertebral bodies, leading to chronic ischemia of the anterior horn cells in the C7\u2013T1 segments. Over time, this results in focal cord atrophy and motor neuron loss without sensory involvement.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in their teens or early twenties with progressive distal upper limb weakness and muscle wasting, most often involving C7\u2013T1 myotomes. Symptoms stabilize after a few years. Preservation of brachioradialis (\u201coblique atrophy\u201d) and sparing of sensory function are hallmarks. Bilateral involvement is usually asymmetric.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line MRI of the cervical spine in neutral and flexion positions demonstrates focal cord thinning at C5\u2013C7 and forward displacement of the posterior dura on flexion. Electromyography shows chronic denervation in C7\u2013T1 muscles with no sensory nerve conduction abnormalities. These findings distinguish Hirayama disease from ALS.","management_principles":"Management focuses on preventing neck flexion by using a cervical collar to avoid further cord compression. There is no proven pharmacotherapy. Surgical dural tethering via posterior cervical duroplasty is considered in progressive cases. Rehabilitation and occupational therapy optimize residual function.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up every 6\u201312 months with clinical strength evaluation and periodic MRI to assess cord atrophy progression. Discontinue cervical collar gradually if no progression after 2\u20133 years. Monitor for compensatory overuse injuries in the unaffected limb.","clinical_pearls":"1. Hirayama disease presents in young males with distal upper limb wasting and no sensory loss. 2. \u2018Snake-eye\u2019 appearance on MRI corresponds to anterior horn cell loss. 3. Neck flexion MRI is essential for diagnosis. 4. Cervical collar can halt progression if applied early. 5.

What is the best workup?","options":["Long exercise test","Short exercise test","Electromyography","Genetic testing"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Long exercise test","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Long exercise test. For skeletal muscle channelopathies (e.g., periodic paralyses, myotonias), the long exercise test (LET) evaluates compound muscle action potential (CMAP) decrement over 30 minutes post-exercise and cooling. Sensitivity for Nav1.4 and Kir2.1 channelopathies is ~90%\u201395% with specificity >90% (Rosenfeld et al. Muscle Nerve 2012;46(6):893\u2013901). Option B (Short exercise test) is less sensitive for periodic paralysis and misses late decrements. Option C (Electromyography) detects myotonic discharges but cannot quantify dynamic CMAP changes. Option D (Genetic testing) is confirmatory but not first-line due to cost and time; electrodiagnostic testing guides targeted mutation analysis.","conceptual_foundation":"Channelopathies encompass conditions arising from ion channel dysfunction in muscle membranes (ICD-11 8A84). They include nondystrophic myotonias and periodic paralyses. Electrodiagnosis relies on assessing membrane excitability and response to exercise. LET builds on principles of activity-dependent channel behavior. The test procedure is standardized: 5 minutes of maximal voluntary exercise, followed by CMAP recordings at intervals up to 30 minutes, often combined with cooling. A decrement >40% is diagnostic.","pathophysiology":"In channelopathies, mutations alter gating kinetics of Nav1.4, Kir2.1, Cav1.1, or ClC-1 channels. During sustained activity and cooling, mutant channels fail to return to normal gating states, causing progressive depolarization or inexcitability. This is reflected electrophysiologically as a declining CMAP amplitude post-exercise. The LET thus directly measures the pathophysiological consequence of channel dysfunction under physiologic stress.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients may present with episodic stiffness (myotonia) or weakness (paralysis) precipitated by rest after exercise, cold, or potassium shifts. Common presentations include episodic limb weakness in periodic paralysis or persistent stiffness in myotonia. Onset is usually in childhood or adolescence. Variants (e.g., hyperkalemic vs. hypokalemic periodic paralysis) have distinct triggers (potassium intake, rest).","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Record baseline CMAP from ulnar or peroneal nerve. Step 2: Perform 5 min sustained maximal voluntary contraction. Step 3: Record CMAP immediately and at 10-min intervals for 30 min; apply cooling if needed. A decrement >40% confirms channelopathy. Needle EMG for myotonic discharges and serum potassium during attacks are adjuncts. Genetic testing targeted to SCN4A, CACNA1S, KCNJ2, or CLCN1 follows abnormal LET.","management_principles":"Management is mutation-guided. Myotonia responds to sodium channel blockers (mexiletine) (AAN Level A). Periodic paralyses require avoidance of triggers, dietary potassium modification, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide). Electrodiagnostic confirmation via LET informs therapy choice. Monitor electrolytes and ECG during treatment.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess electrodiagnostic findings every 2\u20133 years or sooner if clinical status changes. Monitor muscle strength, serum electrolytes, and ECG periodically. Genetic counseling and family screening are recommended. Adjustment of treatment based on symptom frequency and severity is advised.","clinical_pearls":"1. LET sensitivity >90% for Nav1.4 and Kir2.1 mutations. 2. Cooling accentuates CMAP decrement in paramyotonia. 3. Short exercise test misses late CMAP drops in periodic paralysis. 4. Genetic confirmation is confirmatory but not screening. 5. Avoid beta-agonists in hypokalemic periodic paralysis.","references":"1. Rosenfeld J, et al. Muscle Nerve. 2012;46(6):893\u2013901. 2. Matthews E, et al. Neuromuscul Disord. 2018;28(1):3\u201313. 3.
