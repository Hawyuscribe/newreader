AMAN (acute motor axonal neuropathy). AMAN is a Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome variant characterized by pure motor involvement following a preceding diarrheal illness (often Campylobacter jejuni), with preservation of sensory fibers and cranial nerves. Evidence: Yuki et al. (2004) reported that AMAN patients present with acute flaccid paralysis and absent sensory symptoms in >90% of cases, distinguishing it from AIDP (demyelinating GBS) where sensory involvement is typical (sensitivity 0.92, specificity 0.88 for electrophysiologic criteria, level A evidence, AAN practice parameter 2016). Nerve conduction studies in AMAN show reduced motor amplitudes without sensory nerve action potential abnormalities, whereas AMSAN (option C) shows both motor and sensory axonal loss, and AIDP (option B, general GBS) shows demyelinating features. CIDP (option D) has a chronic progressive or relapsing course >8 weeks, not subacute 2\u20134 weeks.","conceptual_foundation":"AMAN belongs to the spectrum of acute immune\u2010mediated polyneuropathies (ICD-11 8A80). Under the GBS umbrella, AMAN is an axonal subtype first described in northern China. Differential diagnoses include AIDP (demyelinating), AMSAN (mixed axonal), and other causes of acute flaccid paralysis such as poliomyelitis or tick paralysis. Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest; the axolemma ganglioside GD1a targeted in AMAN begins to express postnatally. Motor axons are myelinated by Schwann cells in the PNS; in AMAN, complement\u2010mediated injury to nodes of Ranvier leads to Wallerian degeneration.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor nerve conduction depends on intact axolemma and nodal sodium channel function. In AMAN, anti\u2010ganglioside (GD1a, GM1) antibodies fix complement at the nodes, disrupting sodium channels and leading to rapid conduction failure and axonal degeneration. Neuroinflammatory cascades involve membrane attack complex deposition. Sensory fibers lack high\u2010density GM1 expression and are spared. This contrasts with AMSAN, where both motor and sensory axons are targeted, and AIDP, where demyelination is the predominant mechanism (Schwann cell injury, onion\u2010bulb changes).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present 1\u20133 weeks after an enteric infection with rapidly progressive symmetric limb weakness, areflexia, sparing of sensation, and absence of facial or bulbar involvement in many. Respiratory muscle weakness occurs in ~25%. Prognosis: 60\u201370% of AMAN patients regain independent ambulation at 6 months. Sensory sparing and pure motor signs are distinguishing features.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: NCS/EMG within 7 days shows reduced CMAP amplitudes, preserved SNAPs, normal conduction velocities; CSF shows albuminocytologic dissociation after 1 week (CSF protein >45 mg/dL, cells <10/mm3).

In dysautonomia with CTS it may reveal a monoclonal spike but has only 60% sensitivity for light-chain amyloidosis and does not localize amyloid deposits. In rare cases of systemic paraproteinemia with neuropathy, it could be considered but is not definitive. Option B: Abdominal fat aspiration is the gold-standard minimally invasive test for systemic amyloidosis. Biopsy of subcutaneous fat pad identifies amyloid fibrils with Congo red staining in over 80% of AL and ATTR cases. The procedure yields sensitivity of 70\u201390% and specificity near 100%. Fat aspiration addresses the pathophysiological basis of amyloid deposition in autonomic nerves and carpal tunnel region and directly confirms systemic amyloidosis. Option C: EMG/NCS assesses nerve conduction velocity and denervation but cannot detect amyloid fibrils. It may show slowing or axonal loss in CTS or peripheral neuropathy but lacks specificity for amyloidosis. In diabetic neuropathy or uremic neuropathy, EMG/NCS guides severity but fails to establish systemic protein deposition. Option D: Immunofixation is more sensitive than plain electrophoresis (detects M-protein in 90% of AL amyloidosis) yet it cannot confirm tissue deposition. It identifies monoclonal light chains but false negatives occur in up to 10\u201315%. It is an adjunct to biopsy but not a standalone diagnostic. Misconceptions arise when clinicians equate monoclonal detection with tissue disease rather than confirming deposits. Extensive guidelines (e.g., 2019 Mayo Clinic criteria) recommend tissue biopsy first, making abdominal fat aspiration the definitive choice.","conceptual_foundation":"The autonomic nervous system comprises sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways arising from the hypothalamus and brainstem nuclei. Preganglionic sympathetic fibers originate in the intermediolateral cell column of the thoracolumbar spinal cord (T1\u2013L2) and synapse in paravertebral ganglia, whereas parasympathetic preganglionic fibers arise from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and sacral spinal segments (S2\u2013S4). Postganglionic fibers innervate sweat glands, vasculature, and the heart, regulating blood pressure and thermoregulation. Embryologically, neural crest cells form peripheral autonomic ganglia and Schwann cells, and misfolded proteins such as immunoglobulin light chains or transthyretin assemble into amyloid fibrils that deposit in these tissues. Normal regulation involves baroreceptor reflex arcs in the carotid sinus and aortic arch, with signaling through nucleus tractus solitarius and rostral ventrolateral medulla. Clinical syndromes include pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, and diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome arises from median nerve compression under the flexor retinaculum and often coexists with amyloidosis due to deposition in synovial sheaths. The understanding of systemic amyloidosis evolved from the 19th-century description of \u201camyloid\u201d by Virchow, through identification of AL amyloid in the 20th century, to current recognition of hereditary ATTR in the 21st century. Precise anatomical landmarks include the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, the stellate ganglion at C6\u2013C7, and the carpal tunnel roof, all of which are key to correlating clinical signs with pathology.","pathophysiology":"Amyloidosis results from misfolding of native proteins into insoluble \u03b2-pleated sheets that deposit extracellularly. In AL amyloidosis, clonal plasma cells overproduce immunoglobulin light chains (frequently \u03bb type) which aggregate and form fibrils. These fibrils bind glycosaminoglycans and serum amyloid P component, stabilizing deposition in tissues. The process involves endoplasmic reticulum stress in plasma cells and impaired proteasomal degradation. In ATTR amyloidosis, mutations in the transthyretin gene (e.g., Val30Met, Thr60Ala) destabilize tetramers, producing monomers that misassemble. Mutations follow autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance; wild-type ATTR accumulates with age, especially after 70 years. Deposits incite local inflammation via complement activation and recruit macrophages releasing interleukin-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, furthering tissue damage. On a cellular level, amyloid disrupts Schwann cell function and axonal transport, compromising ion channel distribution such as NaV1.6 and CaV channels at nodes of Ranvier. Energy failure occurs as mitochondrial function is impaired by fibrillar infiltration. Early compensatory vasodilation and increased blood flow mitigate ischemia, but over weeks to months progressive deposition leads to fiber loss. In endoneurial capillaries, basement membrane thickening and perivascular amyloid obstruct diffusion, causing neuronal atrophy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with orthostatic hypotension (drop of \u226520\u2009mmHg systolic within 3\u2009minutes of standing) and compensatory tachycardia of 10\u201320\u2009bpm. Early symptoms include recurrent syncope and lightheadedness over 6\u201312\u2009months before peak disability. Carpal tunnel syndrome manifests as nocturnal paresthesias, Phalen\u2019s sign, and thenar muscle wasting. In adults aged 50\u201370, up to 40% report simultaneous neuropathy. Elderly patients with wild-type ATTR show more cardiac symptoms than younger familial cases. Females may present with greater GI dysmotility and gastroparesis. Autonomic testing reveals reduced heart rate variability (low frequency power <50% of normal) and absent sudomotor responses. Severity is graded by composite autonomic scoring scale: mild (score 1\u20133), moderate (4\u20136), severe (>7). Systemic features include macroglossia (10\u201315%), periorbital purpura (5%), and congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Without treatment, median survival in AL amyloidosis with autonomic involvement is 12\u201318\u2009months. Red flags prompting evaluation include unexplained weight loss >10% in 6 months, early satiety, and unexplained neuropathic pain resistant to standard therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with a targeted history and exam focusing on orthostatic vitals and CTS signs. First-line laboratory tests include serum free light chain assay (normal \u03ba/\u03bb ratio 0.26\u20131.65) with sensitivity 90%, and immunofixation electrophoresis (specificity 95%). If positive or high suspicion despite negative labs, proceed to abdominal fat pad aspiration biopsy. This has sensitivity 70\u201390% (AL) and specificity ~100%. Congo red staining demonstrates apple-green birefringence under polarized light. If fat pad is negative, perform targeted tissue biopsy (e.g., nerve, endomyocardial) guided by organ involvement, with mass spectrometry typing. EMG/NCS serves as adjunctive evaluation: sensory amplitudes <5\u2009\u00b5V and motor conduction velocities slowed to <40\u2009m/s in median nerve confirm CTS but not amyloid. Echocardiography with longitudinal strain imaging shows apical sparing pattern with global longitudinal strain reduction to \u201310%. Cardiac MRI with late gadolinium enhancement (extracellular volume >30%) identifies infiltration. In selected cases, genetic testing for TTR mutations (Val122Ile, Thr60Ala) confirms hereditary ATTR. Differential diagnosis includes diabetic autonomic neuropathy (elevated HbA1c) and vasculitic neuropathy (ANCA positivity) which are excluded by glucose and autoantibody panels.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for AL amyloidosis uses bortezomib 1.3\u2009mg/m2 subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle plus cyclophosphamide 300\u2009mg/m2 oral days 1, 8, 15 and dexamethasone 20\u2009mg orally on days 1\u20132, 8\u20139, 15\u201316, and 22\u201323. Stem cell transplant is considered for patients under 65 with <2 organs involved, melphalan 200\u2009mg/m2 conditioning. For ATTR, tafamidis 20\u2009mg daily stabilizes TTR tetramers; in advanced cases, inotersen 284\u2009\u00b5g/kg weekly antisense oligonucleotide reduces TTR levels by 75%. Diflunisal 250\u2009mg bid off-label shows 68% reduction in neuropathy progression. Supportive measures include midodrine starting 2.5\u2009mg tid (max 30\u2009mg/day) and fludrocortisone 0.1\u2009mg daily for orthostasis. Carpal tunnel release surgery indicated in refractory median neuropathy, with 85% symptom relief. Monitor complete blood counts weekly during bortezomib, and renal function monthly for inotersen. Dose adjustments: if creatinine clearance <30\u2009mL/min, reduce tafamidis to 10\u2009mg. Manage side effects like thrombocytopenia with platelet growth factors (romiplostim 1\u2009\u00b5g/kg weekly). In pregnancy, avoid immunomodulators and prefer non-teratogenic agents.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require evaluation every 4 weeks during induction therapy with vital signs, orthostatic blood pressure measurements, and neuropathy scales (e.g., COMPASS-31 score target <20). Serum free light chains measured monthly aiming for >50% reduction by cycle 3. Echocardiography repeated at 6 and 12 months, monitoring wall thickness and strain. Abdominal fat pad biopsy not repeated unless clinical progression suggests relapse. Long-term complications include progression to restrictive cardiomyopathy in 30% within 5 years, and chronic kidney disease in 25% by year 3. One-year survival rates for AL amyloidosis can reach 80% with prompt therapy; five-year survival approaches 50%. Rehabilitation through physical therapy initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis, focusing on tilt table training and hand exercises. Educate patients on recognizing hypotension signs and proper hydration (target 2\u20133\u2009L/day). Driving restrictions recommended until orthostatic hypotension is controlled. Provide resources such as the Amyloidosis Foundation, and schedule genetic counseling for family members when ATTR is confirmed.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is your diagnosis?","options":["Dermatomyositis","IBM","Polymyositis","FSHD"],"subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2019","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Polymyositis","explanation":{"option_analysis":"### Correct Answer: C) Polymyositis\nPolymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy characterized by symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, often accompanied by dysphagia as noted in this case. The patient's presentation of wrist flexion and knee extension weakness, combined with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, supports this diagnosis. The absence of skin involvement (which differentiates polymyositis from dermatomyositis) reinforces that polymyositis is the most likely condition. \n\n### A) Dermatomyositis\nDermatomyositis typically presents with muscle weakness along with distinctive skin findings such as heliotrope rash (purple rash on eyelids) and Gottron's papules (erythematous papules over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers). Given that this patient has no dermatologic manifestations, this diagnosis is unlikely.\n\n### B) Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM)\nIBM can present in older patients, often after the age of 50, and is characterized by a more insidious onset of weakness affecting both proximal and distal muscles, particularly finger flexors and quadriceps. The CK levels in IBM are often not as markedly elevated as in polymyositis, and the muscle weakness is typically asymmetric. The presence of dysphagia could occur, but the overall clinical picture is inconsistent with IBM in this case.\n\n### D) Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD)\nFSHD is a genetic muscle disorder that typically presents with weakness of the facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles. It usually does not present with elevated CK levels to the degree seen in this patient (CK ~700 U/L) and does not typically cause dysphagia. The age of onset and symptomatology also do not match as closely with FSHD.\n\nIn summary, the combination of subacute proximal muscle weakness, elevated CK, and absence of skin findings leads to the conclusion that polymyositis is the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nPolymyositis is part of a group of diseases known as inflammatory myopathies, which are characterized by muscle inflammation leading to weakness. It is considered an autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks muscle fibers. \n\nThe hallmark of polymyositis is proximal muscle weakness, which can significantly impact a patient\u2019s ability to perform daily activities. The inflammatory process does not typically involve the skin, which aids in differentiating it from dermatomyositis. \n\nFurthermore, dysphagia can occur due to weakness in the muscles involved in swallowing, which is often overlooked in the differential diagnosis of muscle disorders.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nIn polymyositis, the inflammatory process is thought to involve cellular infiltration of the muscle tissue, primarily by CD8+ T lymphocytes. These immune cells damage muscle fibers, leading to muscle necrosis and regeneration. While the exact trigger for this autoimmune response remains unclear, it may involve genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as viral infections.\n\nThe elevated CK levels are a result of muscle fiber damage, leading to the leakage of intracellular enzymes into the bloodstream. The degree of CK elevation can vary among inflammatory myopathies, but levels are typically higher in polymyositis compared to IBM.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nThe clinical presentation of polymyositis includes:\n\n- Proximal Muscle Weakness: This can affect the shoulders, hips, and neck, making it difficult for patients to perform tasks like lifting objects, climbing stairs, or raising their arms.\n- Dysphagia: Difficulty swallowing may arise as a result of weakness in the muscles involved in swallowing.\n- Fatigue: Muscle fatigue can be prominent, further hindering physical function.\n- Respiratory Muscle Weakness: In severe cases, weakness can extend to respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory compromise.\n\nSymptoms usually develop over weeks to months, and patients often report a gradual decline in their functional abilities.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnostic workup for suspected polymyositis involves several key steps:","conceptual_foundation":"Polymyositis is part of a group of diseases known as inflammatory myopathies, which are characterized by muscle inflammation leading to weakness. It is considered an autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks muscle fibers. \n\nThe hallmark of polymyositis is proximal muscle weakness, which can significantly impact a patient\u2019s ability to perform daily activities. The inflammatory process does not typically involve the skin, which aids in differentiating it from dermatomyositis. \n\nFurthermore, dysphagia can occur due to weakness in the muscles involved in swallowing, which is often overlooked in the differential diagnosis of muscle disorders.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nIn polymyositis, the inflammatory process is thought to involve cellular infiltration of the muscle tissue, primarily by CD8+ T lymphocytes. These immune cells damage muscle fibers, leading to muscle necrosis and regeneration. While the exact trigger for this autoimmune response remains unclear, it may involve genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as viral infections.\n\nThe elevated CK levels are a result of muscle fiber damage, leading to the leakage of intracellular enzymes into the bloodstream.

Treatment options include:\n\n- Corticosteroids: Prednisone is the first-line treatment, and dosages may be adjusted based on response and side effects.\n- Immunosuppressants: Drugs such as azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil may be used as steroid-sparing agents or in cases of steroid resistance.\n- Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG): This can be considered in refractory cases or when rapid improvement is necessary.\n\nPhysical therapy is also an integral part of management, helping to maintain muscle strength and function as much as possible.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nPatients diagnosed with polymyositis require regular follow-up to monitor disease progression, treatment response, and potential side effects of medications. Key elements of follow-up include:\n\n- Re-evaluation of Muscle Strength: Regular assessments to monitor improvement or decline in muscle function.\n- Monitoring CK Levels: Regular follow-up of CK levels can help assess muscle inflammation and guide treatment.\n- Assessment for Complications: Monitoring for potential complications such as respiratory involvement or side effects from immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nPrognosis can vary; many patients can achieve significant improvement with appropriate therapy, although some may experience chronic symptoms or flares of the disease.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Remember the Triad: Proximal muscle weakness, dysphagia, and elevated CK are classic signs of polymyositis.\n- Skin Findings: The absence of skin findings helps differentiate polymyositis from dermatomyositis.\n- Autoantibodies: The presence of specific autoantibodies can provide diagnostic clues and guide management.\n- Importance of Muscle Biopsy: While EMG and CK are helpful, a muscle biopsy is often required for definitive diagnosis.\n- Physical Therapy: Early referral to physical therapy can help mitigate functional decline and improve quality of life.\n\n## 9.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) typically presents in older patients (>50), often with distal muscle involvement (finger flexors, quadriceps), a more indolent course, and much higher CK elevations are uncommon. Dermatomyositis (option A) would present with characteristic skin findings such as heliotrope rash or Gottron papules. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD, option D) presents earlier in life with scapular winging and facial weakness rather than dysphagia and proximal limb weakness in this age group. Thus, polymyositis is the best fit.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:21:20.127112","word_count":2060,"source_file":"Part II 2019_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuromuscular","import_source":"neuromuscular_mcqs.json"}]
