MRI classically demonstrates midbrain atrophy producing the \u201chummingbird\u201d or \u201cpenguin\u201d sign. Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) (Option B) more often shows autonomic failure, cerebellar signs (in the MSA-C subtype), or prominent striatonigral degeneration (in MSA-P) with the \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign in the pons rather than isolated midbrain atrophy. Thus, midbrain atrophy and prominent swallowing difficulty in a parkinsonian patient strongly favor PSP over MSA.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive Supranuclear Palsy is a tauopathy characterized by deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in subcortical structures, leading to neuronal loss in the midbrain, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and cerebellar dentate nucleus. It falls under the parkinsonian syndromes within movement disorders. Differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease, MSA, corticobasal degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies. The characteristic ocular motor dysfunction reflects involvement of the vertical gaze centers in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal.","pathophysiology":"In PSP, tau pathology leads to neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions that impair microtubule stability. Selective vulnerability of midbrain structures, including the oculomotor nuclei and vertical gaze pathways, produces the clinical tetrad of early falls, axial rigidity, supranuclear gaze palsy, and dysphagia. Neurodegeneration in the groundwork of the substantia nigra contributes to parkinsonism, while involvement of the bulbar motor nuclei leads to swallowing difficulty.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients classically present in their 60s with early gait instability, recurrent backward falls, bradykinesia, axial rigidity, and progressive dysphagia.

PSP typically presents in patients over age 60 with early postural instability leading to falls within the first year in over 80% of cases, symmetric bradykinesia, axial rigidity, masked facies, and characteristic vertical supranuclear gaze palsy\u2014especially downgaze\u2014often accompanied by retrocollis. Pathologically, PSP shows accumulation of hyperphosphorylated 4R tau in the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, periaqueductal gray, and oculomotor nuclei. Median survival is approximately 6.8 years. Movement Disorder Society criteria yield sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 95%. Common misdiagnoses include Parkinson disease (PD), but PD rarely shows early falls or vertical gaze palsy. Population prevalence is about 6.5 per 100,000 in those over 60.\n\nOption B: Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) typically manifests with parkinsonism plus prominent autonomic failure\u2014orthostatic hypotension in >75% by two years\u2014and cerebellar features in MSA-C. Levodopa responsiveness is poor (<30% improvement). Eye movement abnormalities in MSA are usually limited to saccadic slowing, without frank vertical supranuclear palsy. MRI may show a hot cross bun sign in pons. MSA mean survival is 8\u201310 years, and early autonomic signs distinguish it from PSP.\n\nOption C: Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) features early fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations (present in ~75%), REM sleep behavior disorder, and parkinsonism that follows or accompanies dementia within one year. Supranuclear gaze palsy is absent. Cognitive decline predominates early, unlike PSP\u2019s primary ocular and postural findings.\n\nOption D: Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD) presents with asymmetric limb rigidity, apraxia, cortical sensory loss, alien limb phenomenon (~80%), and myoclonus (~50%). Eye movement abnormalities, when present, are not classically vertical supranuclear palsy. MRI reveals asymmetric cortical atrophy, differentiating it from midbrain atrophy in PSP.\n\nPathophysiological Basis for Option A: PSP is driven by tauopathy with selective neuronal loss and gliosis in subcortical structures governing vertical gaze and postural control. Atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum (\u201chummingbird sign\u201d on midsagittal MRI) correlates with clinical gaze palsy. Misconceptions commonly include labeling initial presentation as PD due to overlapping bradykinesia; however, early falls and gaze abnormalities are red flags. Large cohort studies report up to 30% misdiagnosis rates when PSP is confused with PD or MSA, underscoring the importance of ocular motor examination and imaging markers.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) primarily involves midbrain structures within the mesencephalon, particularly the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, which coordinate vertical gaze. The subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, periaqueductal gray, and superior colliculus also degenerate selectively, leading to axial rigidity, postural instability, and saccadic slowing. Embryologically, these regions derive from the alar and basal plates of the midbrain (mesencephalon) in the early neural tube (weeks 4\u20135 gestation). Normal physiology involves balanced excitatory and inhibitory signaling through the basal ganglia\u2013thalamocortical circuits: the direct pathway facilitates voluntary movement, while the indirect pathway suppresses unwanted movement. Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta modulate these pathways via D1 and D2 receptors. Superior collicular and oculomotor nuclei generate saccades and smooth pursuit movements. Related syndromes include Parkinson disease (predominant 3-R tauopathy vs 4-R tauopathy in PSP), corticobasal syndrome with asymmetric cortical involvement, and multiple system atrophy featuring oligodendroglial \u03b1-synuclein. Historical perspective dates to Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski\u2019s 1963 description of a \u2018\u2018heterogeneous degenerative disease\u2019\u2019 distinguished by vertical gaze palsy and axial rigidity. Key imaging landmarks include midsagittal midbrain area <70 mm\u00b2, midbrain-to-pons ratio <0.15, and coronal thinning of superior cerebellar peduncles. These anatomical metrics correlate with clinical severity and guide differential diagnosis in movement disorder clinics.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, PSP is characterized by accumulation of hyperphosphorylated 4-repeat tau protein in neurons and glia. Tau missorting leads to microtubule destabilization and impaired axonal transport. Kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) are upregulated, promoting tau hyperphosphorylation. Misfolded tau oligomers seed further aggregation, triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response. Mitochondrial dysfunction arises from impaired complex I activity, increasing reactive oxygen species. Microglial activation releases pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) exacerbating neurotoxicity. Genetic predisposition includes the MAPT H1 haplotype present in ~60% of PSP patients but with low penetrance; familial cases are rare. Cellular deficits include synaptic loss in the frontal cortex and striatum, observed as decreased dendritic spine density. The time course begins with subtle gait imbalance and saccadic slowing over 6\u201312 months, progressing to full PSP phenotype within 2\u20134 years. Compensatory mechanisms like upregulation of dopamine receptors on surviving neurons offer transient symptomatic relief but cannot overcome widespread neuronal loss. Ultimately, energy deficits and oxidative stress accelerate cell death in oculomotor nuclei, subthalamic nucleus, and pallidal segments, solidifying the clinical picture of supranuclear gaze palsy and postural failure.","clinical_manifestation":"PSP typically manifests in the seventh decade with insidious onset of postural instability and frequent backward falls, often within the first 12 months. Patients report recurrent falls in 85% by six months of symptom onset. Early masked facies and bradykinesia are symmetric, with rigidity predominantly axial. Within 18\u201324 months, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy appears, first affecting downgaze, then upgaze. Retrocollis\u2014a characteristic backward head tilt\u2014develops in approximately 60% by year two. Speech becomes hypophonic and dysarthric; swallowing difficulty arises in 40% by three years, leading to weight loss in 30%. Cognitive deficits are primarily frontal executive dysfunction, with mild behavioral changes; dementia is less severe than in Lewy body disorders. On neurological exam, smooth pursuit is disrupted, vertical saccades slowed (<0.5 deg/ms), convergent-retraction nystagmus may be elicited, and axial rigidity is noted with increased extensor tone. Plantar responses are often extensor. Severity scales such as the Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Rating Scale (PSPRS) increase by ~10 points per year, correlating with dependence. Gender distribution is equal. Pediatric PSP is not reported. Without treatment, natural history leads to wheelchair dependence by year 3\u20134 and death from aspiration pneumonia by 6\u20137 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on early falls and vertical gaze palsy. Step 2: Exclude mimics\u2014trial of levodopa up to 600\u20131000 mg/day for at least 4 weeks; <30% improvement on UPDRS confirms poor responsiveness. Step 3: Brain MRI with 3 T scanner using T1 sagittal and axial T2 sequences: midsagittal midbrain area <70 mm\u00b2 yields sensitivity 60% and specificity 75% for PSP; ratio of midbrain to pons cross-sectional areas <0.15 has 80% specificity. Coronal images assess superior cerebellar peduncle thinning (<2.2 mm). Step 4: Second-line FDG-PET shows hypometabolism in midbrain and frontal cortex (80% sensitivity). Step 5: Optional CSF analysis demonstrates elevated total tau in ~70% of cases, normal \u03b2-amyloid. Cell count is acellular; protein mildly increased (45\u201360 mg/dL). Step 6: Neuropsychological testing reveals frontal executive deficits; memory is relatively spared. Step 7: Electrophysiology\u2014saccadometry shows peak vertical saccade velocity <300\u00b0/s. Step 8: Laboratory workup (TSH 0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L, B12 >200 pg/mL, RPR negative) to rule out metabolic or infectious etiologies. Differential points: MSA shows autonomic failure and hot cross bun sign; CBD shows asymmetric cortical atrophy and alien limb; LBD features early dementia and visual hallucinations.","management_principles":"There is no approved disease-modifying therapy for PSP. Symptomatic management focuses on mobility, gaze, and non-motor symptoms. First-line pharmacotherapy includes a levodopa trial up to 1000 mg/day in divided doses (e.g., 250 mg four times daily); most patients achieve <30% motor improvement. Amantadine 100 mg twice daily may transiently improve axial rigidity and gait in 20\u201325% of patients. Botulinum toxin A (25\u201350 IU intramuscularly every 12 weeks) can alleviate retrocollis. Antidepressants such as sertraline 50 mg daily address mood in ~40%. Second-line cognitive enhancers include rivastigmine starting at 1.5 mg BID, titrated to 6 mg BID, with modest executive benefit. Zolpidem 5\u201310 mg at night may transiently improve vertical gaze in anecdotal reports. Non-pharmacological measures comprise physical therapy with balance and gaze exercises thrice weekly, speech therapy for dysphagia and communication, and occupational therapy for adaptive devices. Deep brain stimulation and focused ultrasound are ineffective. Monitor treatment with PSPRS every 6 months. Adjust amantadine dose in renal impairment (reduce to 100 mg daily if creatinine clearance <50 mL/min). Avoid MAO-B inhibitors due to increased dyskinesia risk. Coordinate multidisciplinary care to manage complications such as aspiration pneumonia and falls.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur every 3 months during the first year of diagnosis, then every 6 months thereafter. At each visit, assess gait, falls frequency, and PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) aiming to track an annual increase of <10 points if possible. Repeat brain MRI annually to monitor midbrain atrophy progression; no specific treatment changes based solely on imaging. Perform videofluoroscopic swallow evaluation every 12 months or sooner if dysphagia worsens. Monitor weight and nutritional status at each visit; aim to maintain body mass index >20 kg/m\u00b2 to reduce aspiration risk. Screen for depression and cognitive changes using standardized scales (e.g., Geriatric Depression Scale, MoCA) every 6 months. Anticipate long-term complications: aspiration pneumonia occurs in 50% by year 3; recurrent falls in 80% by year 2. Prognosis: 1-year survival >95%, 5-year survival ~50%. Engage rehabilitation services immediately\u2014physical therapy twice weekly, speech therapy monthly. Educate patients and caregivers on home safety, fall prevention, and swallowing precautions. Advise driving cessation at onset of postural instability. Provide resources such as the PSP Association and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke support networks.","clinical_pearls":"1.

'Artaib' (a brand of opicapone in some regions) is a COMT inhibitor that prolongs levodopa effect, reducing off periods. Decreasing levodopa worsens off time; lengthening intervals aggravates fluctuations. Deep brain stimulation is reserved for refractory motor fluctuations after medical therapies fail. Rescue injections (apomorphine) treat acute off episodes but are not first-line for wearing-off.","conceptual_foundation":"Motor fluctuations in PD arise from short half-life of oral levodopa and progressive nigrostriatal degeneration. Under ICD-11, these are coded under 8A02.1. The concept of 'wear-off' was popularized in the 1980s with increasing disease duration. Basal ganglia circuits integrate cortical input via dopaminergic modulation; pulsatile stimulation leads to receptor sensitization and dyskinesias. Pharmacologic strategies aim to provide more continuous dopaminergic stimulation.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology involves tonic dopaminergic release from substantia nigra pars compacta. In PD, loss of dopaminergic neurons leads to motor symptoms. Oral levodopa creates pulsatile receptor stimulation, causing downstream changes: altered glutamatergic transmission, synaptic plasticity in the striatum, and upregulation of D1 receptors, leading to dyskinesia and motor fluctuations. COMT inhibitors inhibit peripheral levodopa metabolism (via COMT), increasing central availability and smoothing plasma levels.","clinical_manifestation":"Wearing-off presents as return of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia 2\u20133 hours post-dose.
