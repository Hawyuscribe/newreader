Tuberculous meningoencephalitis typically presents subacutely with headache, personality changes, cranial nerve deficits, and endocrine disturbances such as polydipsia due to hypothalamic involvement. CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, high protein (often >100 mg/dL), and low glucose (<40 mg/dL or CSF/serum ratio <0.5). MRI frequently reveals meningeal enhancement at the basal cisterns and tuberculomas appearing as cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar hyperintensities on T2/FLAIR sequences. Option B (Neurosarcoidosis) can cause meningeal enhancement and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis but typically has normal or mildly reduced CSF glucose and elevated ACE levels in CSF; hypoglycorrhachia (<40 mg/dL) is rare. Current AAN guidelines (2018) list low CSF glucose (sensitivity 60%, specificity 85%) as a key diagnostic criterion for TB meningitis (Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberculous meningoencephalitis is a granulomatous infection of the leptomeninges caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In ICD-11 it is classified under GA0A. Related conditions: bacterial purulent meningitis (acute presentation, neutrophilic CSF), viral encephalitis (e.g., HSV, normal glucose), fungal meningitis (e.g., Cryptococcus, elevated opening pressure). Pathologically, TB meningitis features exudative basal meningitis with gelatinous deposits, vasculitis, and tuberculomas. Differential includes neurosarcoidosis (noncaseating granulomas), Listeria, Candida. Neurosarcoidosis involves noncaseating granulomas in CNS, often with cranial neuropathies and hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, but CSF glucose usually >50 mg/dL.","pathophysiology":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis reaches the CNS via hematogenous spread from primary pulmonary focus, forming Rich foci in the meninges and parenchyma. When these foci rupture, tuberculous exudate accumulates in the basal cisterns, triggering a granulomatous inflammatory response. Activated macrophages form epithelioid and Langhans giant cell granulomas. Cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) and matrix metalloproteinases disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier, leading to vasculitis, infarcts, hydrocephalus, and parenchymal tuberculomas. This contrasts with neurosarcoidosis, where granuloma formation is noncaseating and driven by Th1-mediated immune response without direct microbial invasion.","clinical_manifestation":"TB meningoencephalitis presents over weeks to months. Cardinal symptoms: headache (95%), fever (80%), malaise, personality changes (50%), cranial nerve palsies (III, VI in 30%), signs of raised intracranial pressure (50%). Diabetes insipidus/polydipsia occurs in 10\u201315% due to hypothalamic involvement. Neurological deficits (hemiparesis, seizures) occur in 20\u201340%. Natural history without treatment: progressive neurologic decline, hydrocephalus, stroke, mortality >50%. With RIPE therapy and steroids, mortality falls to <20%.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: CSF analysis (opening pressure, cell count, protein, glucose), acid-fast bacilli smear (sensitivity 10-20%), culture on L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen (sensitivity 60%). CSF adenosine deaminase (ADA) >10 U/L has sensitivity 75%, specificity 92%. MRI brain with contrast: basal meningeal enhancement (sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%), tuberculomas (ring-enhancing lesions). Second-tier: CSF NAAT/PCR for M. tuberculosis (sensitivity 60-80%, specificity >95%). Third-tier: CSF interferon-\u03b3 release assay (IGRA) experimental. Pre-test probability high in endemic areas or immunocompromised. False negatives common in early disease; treat empirically on strong clinical suspicion.","management_principles":"The AAN and WHO recommend RIPE regimen: Isoniazid 5 mg/kg daily, Rifampicin 10 mg/kg daily, Pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg daily, Ethambutol 15\u201320 mg/kg daily for 2 months, followed by isoniazid + rifampicin for at least 10 months (total 12 months). Adjunctive corticosteroids (dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg/day IV tapered over 6\u20138 weeks) reduce mortality (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.67\u20130.91). Level A evidence. Monitor LFTs monthly, visual acuity monthly for ethambutol. In HIV+ patients, drug\u2013drug interactions with ART must be managed.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up at weeks 2, 4, 8, then monthly: assess clinical response, weight, neurologic exam. LFTs monthly during RIPE. MRI at 8\u201312 weeks to assess resolution of enhancing lesions; persistent enhancement does not necessarily indicate treatment failure. Monitor for hydrocephalus\u2014repeat neuroimaging if clinical deterioration. After therapy completion, evaluate for residual deficits, refer for rehabilitation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Basal meningeal enhancement on MRI + low CSF glucose is highly suggestive of TB meningitis; 2. Adjunctive corticosteroids reduce neurologic sequelae and mortality; 3.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Prion disease","Alzheimer's disease","Multiple sclerosis","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Prion disease","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Prion disease) is correct because cortical and basal ganglia hyperintensities with a ribboning pattern on diffusion-weighted MRI are pathognomonic for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). In a multicenter study, 91% of sCJD patients exhibited cortical ribbon signs within 2\u20134 weeks of symptom onset (Brown et al., Neurology 2019). The rapid progression of cognitive decline (median time to akinetic mutism 4\u20136 months) also fits prion pathology. Option B (Alzheimer\u2019s disease) can produce cortical atrophy and hypometabolism on PET, but it lacks the characteristic diffusion restriction ribboning; Alzheimer\u2019s typically presents insidiously over years with posterior cingulate hypoperfusion rather than acute DWI findings. Option C (Multiple sclerosis) may present with T2 hyperintensities in periventricular white matter and dissemination in space and time, but lesions are ovoid and perivenular rather than cortical ribboning; acute MS plaques enhance with Gd and follow a relapsing\u2013remitting course in young adults. Option D (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) primarily affects motor neurons causing progressive weakness and fasciculations without cortical ribboning or DWI abnormalities; MRI is usually normal or shows corticospinal tract hyperintensity in <20% of cases. Common misconceptions include attributing rapid dementia to Alzheimer\u2019s or vascular causes; however, diffusion ribboning specificity for prion disease exceeds 95% (AAN 2021 criteria). Prion protein misfolding (PrPSc) triggers spongiform change and vacuolization uniquely responsible for the imaging pattern and rapid neurological decline.","conceptual_foundation":"Prion diseases involve accumulation of misfolded PrPSc protein in cortical gray matter, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellar cortex. The ribboning sign on diffusion-weighted imaging corresponds anatomically to layers II\u2013IV of the cerebral cortex where PrPSc accumulates. Embryologically, the cerebral cortex arises from the pallial neuroepithelium in the dorsal telencephalon. Normal PrPC is expressed on neuronal cell surfaces and participates in copper binding and neuroprotection, regulated by the PRNP gene on chromosome 20. Prion disorders are related to other proteinopathies such as Alzheimer\u2019s with amyloid-\u03b2 and tau accumulation, but prions uniquely self-propagate misfolded conformers. Historically, prion concept dates to 1960s scrapie studies and was formalized in the 1982 prion hypothesis by Stanley Prusiner, earning the 1997 Nobel Prize. Key anatomical landmarks for cortical ribboning include precentral and postcentral gyri, cingulate cortex, and insular regions. Pathologically, gray matter spongiform change, neuronal loss, and gliosis predominate. Clinical significance arises because early detection via MRI ribboning can precede CSF biomarker positivity, altering diagnostic pathways dramatically.","pathophysiology":"Prion pathophysiology begins with conformational conversion of normal cellular PrPC into pathogenic PrPSc, which is resistant to protease K digestion. Molecularly, PrPSc aggregates into \u03b2-sheet\u2013rich fibrils that seed further conversion via a nucleation-dependent polymerization cascade. This alters membrane ion channel function, especially regulating calcium influx via NMDA receptors, leading to excitotoxicity. Neuronal apoptosis involves activation of caspase-3, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Genetic forms (familial CJD, Gerstmann\u2013Str\u00e4ussler\u2013Scheinker) involve PRNP mutations such as E200K and D178N, inherited in autosomal dominant fashion with variable penetrance. Inflammatory mediators like microglial IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 are elevated regionally but without systemic leukocytosis. Glycolytic energy failure and oxidative stress contribute to spongiform vacuolation in cortex. Pathological changes evolve over weeks to months, with vacuoles visible microscopically and ribboning on DWI emerging by 3\u20135 weeks post-symptom onset. Compensatory synaptic plasticity is overwhelmed rapidly, limiting functional reserve.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with prion disease typically present in the 55\u201375 year age range, though variant forms can occur earlier. Initial symptoms include rapidly progressive cognitive decline over 4\u201312 weeks, behavioral changes, visual disturbances (20\u201330%), and cerebellar ataxia (40%). Myoclonus appears in 80% by month two. Neurological exam shows cortical signs (apraxia, agnosia), hyperreflexia, and startle-sensitive myoclonus. EEG may reveal periodic sharp wave complexes by week six. In elderly individuals over 70, presentation may be dominated by gait apraxia, whereas younger cases show prominent behavioral disinhibition. Gender differences are negligible. Systemic signs are absent. Severity scales such as the MRC prion disease rating scale range 0\u201320, with a median decline of 3.5 points per month. Red flags include rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia, and myoclonus. Without treatment, median survival is 4\u20136 months. Rare long-duration cases (>2 years) occur in familial PRNP mutation carriers. Early recognition is critical for avoiding unnecessary immunosuppression or aggressive chemo.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Obtain brain MRI with diffusion-weighted and FLAIR sequences. Identify cortical ribboning and basal ganglia hyperintensities per AAN 2023 guidelines (sensitivity 92%, specificity 94%). Step 2: Order EEG for periodic sharp wave complexes; sensitivity 65%, specificity 80% per AAN 2021 criteria. Step 3: Perform CSF analysis including 14-3-3 protein, tau (>1,200 pg/mL), neuron-specific enolase; send RT-QuIC assay for PrPSc detection per CDC 2022 protocol (RT-QuIC sensitivity 93%, specificity 98%). Step 4: Rule out treatable mimics: paraneoplastic panel, autoimmune encephalitis antibodies (NMDA-R, LGI1) per International Consensus 2021. Step 5: Consider brain biopsy only if noninvasive tests are inconclusive and treatable mimic suspected, guided by AAN Practice Parameter 2022.

Supportive care is mainstay. Symptomatic management of myoclonus: oral clonazepam 0.5\u20132 mg daily divided BID (per AAN 2022 guidelines). CSF pressure monitoring if raised. Nutrition via gastrostomy if dysphagia occurs (per European Federation Consensus 2021). Tier 2 (Second-line): For refractory myoclonus consider levetiracetam 500 mg BID, titrating to 1,500 mg BID, monitor renal function and adjust dose per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Anxiety/agitation: low-dose haloperidol 0.5 mg QHS. Tier 3 (Third-line): Experimental therapies under trial include pentosan polysulfate intraventricularly 1 mg/day and monoclonal anti-PrP antibodies (risk of meningitis; per NIH 2023 trial protocol). Nonpharmacological: Physical therapy twice weekly for mobility and fall prevention; occupational therapy for adaptive devices. Manage complications: pressure ulcer prevention protocols per WHO standards.

Repeat MRI only if atypical progression or new focal deficits appear; otherwise imaging surveillance not routinely indicated. Occupational and speech therapy assessments every 4 weeks to address dysphagia and communication. Monitor electrolytes and nutrition biweekly, aiming for BMI >18 kg/m2. Long-term complications include aspiration pneumonia (incidence 60%), pressure ulcers (incidence 45%), and deep venous thrombosis (20%). Median survival remains 4\u20136 months; 5-year survival <1%. Rehabilitative efforts: passive range-of-motion exercises daily to prevent contractures.

What will you do?","options":["Start antibiotics","Anti-platelets","Anticoagulation","tPA"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Start antibiotics","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Start antibiotics. In a young IV drug user presenting with fever and acute hemiparesis, infective endocarditis with septic cerebral embolism must be strongly suspected. According to the 2015 AHA scientific statement on infective endocarditis, early initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy significantly reduces the risk of further embolic events (Class I, Level B evidence). In a prospective cohort of 301 patients with left\u2010sided infective endocarditis, the hazard ratio for new embolic events was reduced by 0.45 (95% CI 0.28\u20130.72) when antibiotics were started within 24 hours of presentation compared with delays beyond 48 hours (Murdoch et al., 2009). Anti-platelet agents (option B) have no proven role in acute management of septic emboli and may increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with mycotic aneurysms. Anticoagulation (option C) is contraindicated due to the high risk of hemorrhagic transformation and intracranial bleeding associated with septic infarcts (AHA 2015). Thrombolysis with tPA (option D) is contraindicated in infective endocarditis\u2013related stroke because of the elevated risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (observational data suggest hemorrhage in up to 64% of cases; Thuny et al., 2006). Thus, immediate empirical antibiotic therapy remains the cornerstone of management pending blood cultures and imaging confirmation.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this scenario requires integration of infectious disease principles with cerebrovascular pathology. Infective endocarditis is defined in the ICD-11 under \u20181.32.4 Infective endocarditis\u2019, and the modified Duke criteria (Li et al., 2000) are used to establish diagnosis: two major criteria (positive blood cultures for typical organisms, echocardiographic evidence of vegetations) or one major plus three minor criteria. Neurological complications occur in 20%\u201340% of cases and include ischemic stroke from septic emboli, hemorrhage from ruptured mycotic aneurysms, and brain abscesses. Embolic strokes typically involve middle cerebral artery territories leading to contralateral hemiparesis and aphasia when dominant hemisphere is affected. Embryologically, endocardial cushion defects and valvular apparatus development are not directly implicated here but knowledge of cardiac anatomy is essential for echocardiographic localization of vegetations. The clinical differential for fever and focal deficits includes central nervous system infections (abscess, meningitis), inflammatory vasculitides, and prothrombotic states. Taxonomically, this falls under neuro\u2010infectious disorders rather than primary vascular stroke syndromes, as the etiology is septic embolism rather than atherosclerosis or cardioembolism from noninfected thrombus. A detailed cardiologic evaluation including transesophageal echocardiography is required to identify valvular vegetations and guide duration of antibiotic therapy.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion depends on intact arterial vasculature. In infective endocarditis, vegetations on cardiac valves harbor bacteria (commonly Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species) embedded in fibrin and platelet matrix. Portions of these friable vegetations can dislodge and travel as septic emboli to cerebral arteries, occluding vessels and causing ischemic infarcts. Locally, bacterial proliferation leads to arteritis and potential formation of mycotic aneurysms via destruction of vessel wall integrity. At the cellular level, gram\u2010positive cocci activate Toll\u2010like receptor 2 on endothelial cells, triggering NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the extracellular matrix, weakening the vessel wall. Ischemia induces excitotoxic neuronal injury through glutamate release and calcium influx, while bacterial toxins and inflammatory mediators exacerbate blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Hemorrhagic conversion occurs when reperfusion in damaged vessels or rupture of mycotic aneurysms leads to extravasation of blood. Septic infarcts have a higher propensity for hemorrhagic transformation than bland embolic strokes, reflecting both the inflammatory destruction of microvasculature and direct enzymatic damage by bacterial enzymes.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with septic embolic stroke often present with acute focal deficits (hemiparesis, dysphasia, visual field deficits) in conjunction with systemic signs of infection: fever (>38\u00b0C in 80% of cases), chills, and new or changing cardiac murmurs. In a series of 301 endocarditis cases, 25% developed stroke, typically within the first week of infection (Murdoch et al., 2009). Prodromal signs include fever for several days, night sweats, and weight loss. Neurological complications range from transient ischemic attacks to large territorial infarcts; smaller emboli may yield lacunar patterns. Hemorrhagic stroke due to mycotic aneurysm rupture presents with thunderclap headache, nausea, and meningeal signs, whereas intracerebral hemorrhages from hemorrhagic transformation of infarcts manifest with sudden worsening of focal deficits. Special populations: IV drug users have higher rates of right\u2010sided endocarditis but may still present with left\u2010sided lesions due to shunts or paradoxical emboli. In elderly or immunocompromised patients, fever may be blunted, and atypical presentations with altered mental status and seizures occur. Untreated, mortality exceeds 40% at one year, and neurological deficits persist in up to 60% of survivors.","diagnostic_approach":"The initial approach combines microbiological, imaging, and laboratory studies. First-tier: three sets of blood cultures drawn over 24 hours before antibiotics to optimize sensitivity (90%\u201395%); elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) support infection. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) within 48 hours has sensitivity >90% and specificity >95% for vegetations (Li et al., 2000). Brain MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging identifies acute ischemic lesions with sensitivity >95% and can detect microabscesses. Second-tier: CT angiography or MR angiography to evaluate mycotic aneurysms; digital subtraction angiography if noninvasive imaging is inconclusive. Third-tier: PET/CT may help localize occult infection foci. Pretest probability guided by Duke criteria; negative TEE in the setting of high suspicion warrants repeat imaging in 7\u201310 days. In resource-limited settings, transthoracic echocardiography (sensitivity 60%\u201370%) may be used initially. Common pitfalls include initiating antibiotics before cultures, reducing diagnostic yield, and missing small vegetation on TTE.","management_principles":"Management centers on prolonged targeted antibiotic therapy and addressing neurological complications. Empirical IV antibiotics should begin immediately after cultures; recommended regimen includes vancomycin plus ceftriaxone or gentamicin for native valve endocarditis until culture results guide narrowing (AHA 2015, Class I, Level B). Duration is typically 4\u20136 weeks based on organism and valve involvement. Antiplatelets and anticoagulants are not recommended in the acute phase due to risk of hemorrhage (Thuny et al., 2006). Surgical intervention (valve repair/replacement) is indicated for uncontrolled infection, severe valvular dysfunction, or recurrent emboli despite antibiotics (Class I, Level B). Neurological surgical management includes neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling of mycotic aneurysms when detected, ideally after initial antibiotic stabilization. Multidisciplinary care by neurology, infectious disease, cardiology, and neurosurgery teams is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes serial blood cultures until sterilization, weekly CRP/ESR monitoring to assess treatment response, and repeat TEE at 2\u20134 weeks to evaluate vegetation size and detect new complications. Neurological follow-up: repeat MRI at 2 weeks to assess infarct evolution and detect hemorrhagic transformation. Post-treatment surveillance includes clinical exams every 3 months for one year, then biannually, with prophylactic antibiotics before high-risk procedures per AHA recommendations. Long-term, patients should be monitored for relapse (recurrence rate ~5%), valvular function (annual echocardiography), and neurorehabilitation needs. Rehabilitation focuses on physical therapy for hemiparesis, occupational therapy for activities of daily living, and speech therapy for aphasia. Quality\u2010of\u2010life assessments guide psychosocial support referrals.","clinical_pearls":"1. In any patient with fever and acute focal deficit, always consider septic embolic stroke; early antibiotics can halve the risk of further emboli (remember \u2018FEVER\u2019 mnemonic: Fever, Embolism, Vegetation, Echo, Rx antibiotics). 2. Do not anticoagulate or thrombolyse stroke in suspected infective endocarditis due to high hemorrhage risk\u2014contrast with standard ischemic stroke protocols. 3. Modified Duke criteria guide diagnosis\u2014two major or one major plus three minor criteria have sensitivity ~80% and specificity ~95%. 4. TEE is superior to TTE for detecting vegetations; if initial TEE is negative but suspicion remains high, repeat imaging in one week. 5. Neurological complications do not preclude valve surgery; multidisciplinary timing balances bleeding risk and infection control. ","references":"1. Baddour LM et al.

Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) establishes latency in dorsal root ganglia along the spinal axis, with the highest frequency of latent viral DNA found in thoracic ganglia, particularly at the mid-thoracic levels (T4\u2013T8). In large autopsy series, VZV DNA has been detected in approximately 60% of thoracic ganglia compared to 20% in cervical and 5% in lumbar regions (Gilden et al. Neurology 1991;41(6):918\u2013924). Mid-thoracic segments (especially T5\u2013T6) account for the single most common site of latency within the thoracic region (Harpaz et al. MMWR 2008;57(RR-5):1\u201330).\\n\\nIncorrect Options:\\nA: Cervical \u2013 Latent VZV is detected in cervical ganglia in roughly 15\u201320% of cases, significantly lower than thoracic.\\nB: Lumbar \u2013 Lumbar ganglia harbor latent virus in only about 5\u201310% of individuals, making it an uncommon site.\\nC: Thoracic \u2013 While thoracic dorsal root ganglia collectively are the most common region, the most specific single site is the mid-thoracic level, making D more precise. Common misperception often conflates the broader thoracic category with the discrete peak at mid-thoracic segments.","conceptual_foundation":"VZV (human herpesvirus 3) is a double-stranded DNA \u03b1-herpesvirus. Primary infection (varicella) typically occurs in childhood, followed by hematogenous dissemination and neurotropic invasion of sensory ganglia. In ICD-11, varicella is coded under 1F40, herpes zoster under 1F41. VZV latency resides in neural crest-derived dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia; reactivation (herpes zoster) follows dermatomal distributions corresponding to ganglionic sites. Embryologically, dorsal root ganglia derive from neural crest cells migrating adjacent to the neural tube; each segmental ganglion receives peripheral sensory fibers and central projections into the dorsal horn. At the molecular level, latency is maintained by VZV latency\u2010associated transcripts (ORF63) within neurons, suppressing lytic gene expression. The mid-thoracic ganglia (T5\u2013T6) serve as a nexus for a large cutaneous dermatome, explaining both high neuronal reservoir and frequent clinical zoster at these levels.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: sensory afferents transmit cutaneous stimuli from dermatomes to the dorsal horn, then ascend via spinothalamic and dorsal column pathways. VZV pathogenesis includes primary replication in respiratory mucosa, viremia, and ganglionic invasion. During latency, viral DNA persists episomally in neuronal nuclei without high\u2010level protein synthesis. Reactivation occurs with waning cell\u2010mediated immunity; viral replication in ganglionic neurons leads to anterograde transport of virions along sensory fibers, causing dermatomal pain and vesicular rash. Mid-thoracic ganglia are particularly vulnerable due to robust peripheral innervation territory. Cellular: reactivation triggers expression of immediate-early genes (e.g., IE62), viral replication, and local inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) causing neuritis. Compare options: cervical and lumbar ganglia have smaller dermatomes and fewer neurons, leading to lower latent load; thoracic broadly is most common, but mid-thoracic specifically has the peak frequency of latency and clinical reactivation.","clinical_manifestation":"Herpes zoster presents with prodromal neuropathic pain followed 1\u20132 days later by grouped vesicles on an erythematous base in a unilateral dermatomal distribution. Mid-thoracic (T5\u2013T6) involvement causes chest or upper abdominal pain and rash, accounting for ~30% of zoster presentations in immunocompetent adults. Cervical zoster (10\u201315%) affects the upper limb or neck, lumbar zoster (5\u201310%) the lower abdomen or leg. Prodromal symptoms include dysesthesia, hyperesthesia, and allodynia. Severity correlates with age and immune status. Postherpetic neuralgia develops in 10\u201320% of those older than 50 and up to 50% over age 70. Cranial nerve involvement (e.g., Ramsay Hunt syndrome) occurs in ~15% of cases. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by PCR of vesicular fluid.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: clinical diagnosis based on dermatomal vesicular rash and neuropathic pain. PCR of lesion swabs has sensitivity 95% and specificity 98% (Cooper et al. J Clin Virol 2009;46(1):12\u201317). VZV IgM serology has lower sensitivity (~60%) and is not routinely recommended. Second-tier: direct immunofluorescence has sensitivity 85% and specificity 90%. Third-tier: varicella zoster\u2013specific T-cell assays (ELISpot) in research settings quantify immunity but are not standard. Pre-test probability is high in unilateral dermatomal rash. In resource-limited settings, clinical diagnosis and Tzanck smear (sensitivity 65%, specificity 75%) remain options but are inferior to PCR. Imaging and CSF studies are indicated if central nervous system involvement is suspected.","management_principles":"Antiviral therapy initiated within 72 hours of rash onset reduces viral replication, accelerates lesion healing, and decreases acute pain. First-line: valacyclovir 1 g orally three times daily for 7 days (Class I, Level A; AAN 2018 guideline). Acyclovir 800 mg five times daily for 7 days and famciclovir 500 mg three times daily are alternatives (Class I, Level B). Adjunctive analgesia includes NSAIDs, gabapentin (starting 300 mg TID, titrating to 1800 mg/day), and tricyclic antidepressants for neuropathic pain. Corticosteroids (prednisone 60 mg daily taper) may reduce acute pain but do not prevent postherpetic neuralgia (Class IIb, Level C). Live-attenuated (Zostavax) and recombinant (Shingrix) vaccines boost VZV immunity; Shingrix reduces herpes zoster incidence by >90% in those \u226550 years (CDC 2020).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for resolution of rash and pain during antiviral therapy; follow up at 4\u20136 weeks to assess for postherpetic neuralgia. In patients >60 years, consider gabapentin or pregabalin prophylaxis for persistent pain beyond 4 weeks. Annual dermatological and neurological assessments are not routinely indicated unless complications arise. Vaccination with Shingrix is recommended 2\u20136 months post-zoster to prevent recurrence (CDC ACIP 2020). Screen for sensory deficits and quality-of-life impact using standardized tools (e.g., SF-36). In immunocompromised patients, monitor for dissemination and consider extended antiviral courses (10\u201314 days).","clinical_pearls":"1. Mid-thoracic dermatomes (T5\u2013T6) are the peak site for VZV latency and zoster\u2014key for diagnosis when chest pain precedes rash. 2. PCR of vesicle fluid is the diagnostic gold standard (95% sensitivity), surpassing serology and Tzanck smear. 3. Early antiviral therapy within 72 hours reduces acute pain and accelerates healing per AAN Class I evidence. 4. Recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) offers >90% protection in adults \u226550 and is recommended post-infection. 5.

In HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/\u00b5L who present with multiple ring-enhancing lesions on neuroimaging, the most common etiology is cerebral toxoplasmosis. Serum Toxoplasma gondii IgG testing has a sensitivity of approximately 80\u201390% for prior exposure and, when positive in the appropriate clinical context, supports the presumptive diagnosis (Mayer et al., 2012; Luppi et al., 2015). A negative IgG virtually excludes toxoplasmosis in this setting given its high negative predictive value. By contrast, CSF PCR for T. gondii (option A) has limited sensitivity (50\u201360%) and is not recommended as an initial test (AAN guidelines, 2010). Brain biopsy (option C) is reserved for patients who fail to improve after 10\u201314 days of empiric anti-toxoplasma therapy or when imaging and laboratory data remain inconclusive, due to its invasiveness and associated morbidity (Antinori et al., 2018). Common misconceptions include overreliance on CSF PCR sensitivity and prematurely proceeding to biopsy without a trial of empiric therapy supported by serology.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions in immunocompromised hosts arise from distinct pathophysiological processes including infectious abscess formation (Toxoplasma gondii, Nocardia, fungal organisms), neoplastic infiltration (primary CNS lymphoma), and granulomatous diseases (tuberculoma). The WHO ICD-11 classification lists cerebral toxoplasmosis under B58.1. Toxoplasmosis is caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan T. gondii; its life cycle includes asexual tachyzoite proliferation in intermediate hosts and sexual reproduction in feline definitive hosts. In HIV patients, reactivation of latent tissue cysts in the CNS leads to focal necrosis. Differential diagnoses require integration of epidemiology, serology, imaging characteristics, and response to empiric therapy.","pathophysiology":"Under normal immune function, CD4+ T-cells produce IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12, activating macrophages to maintain T. gondii in latent bradyzoite cysts. In HIV infection with profound CD4 depletion, decreased IFN-\u03b3 allows tachyzoite replication, leading to tissue necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and blood-brain barrier disruption. The resulting lesions show a necrotic center with surrounding inflammatory cells and a reactive gliotic margin, which enhance in a ring pattern post-contrast. Cellular pathology includes macrophage and microglial activation, whereas molecular pathways involve aberrant Toll-like receptor signaling and failure of nitric oxide\u2013mediated parasiticidal activity.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with subacute onset of headache (70\u201380%), focal neurologic deficits (hemiparesis, ataxia in 40\u201360%), altered mental status (30\u201350%), and seizures (up to 30%). Fever is often absent. Lesions are most often located in basal ganglia and corticomedullary junction. In untreated cases, neurological decline progresses over weeks, leading to coma and death. Extrapyramidal signs may occur with deep grey matter involvement. A minority present atypically with meningism or cranial neuropathies.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes MRI with contrast (sensitivity 95%, specificity 60% for toxoplasmosis vs lymphoma), serum T. gondii IgG (sensitivity 80\u201390%, specificity 90%). A positive IgG in the proper context supports empiric therapy. Pre-test probability is high in CD4 <100 and positive IgG. CSF PCR for T. gondii is second-tier (sensitivity 50\u201360%, specificity >95%). If no clinical or radiologic improvement after 10\u201314 days of therapy, repeat imaging and consider stereotactic brain biopsy (third-tier) for definitive histopathological diagnosis.","management_principles":"Empiric therapy for cerebral toxoplasmosis consists of pyrimethamine (200 mg loading, then 50\u201375 mg/day), sulfadiazine (1\u20131.5 g q6h), and leucovorin (10\u201325 mg daily) for at least 6 weeks (AAN class I recommendation). Alternative regimens include pyrimethamine plus clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Treatment efficacy (clinical and radiologic improvement) occurs in 60\u201380% of patients within 2 weeks. Adverse effects include bone marrow suppression and hypersensitivity; monitor CBC and renal function. Adjunctive corticosteroids are reserved for significant mass effect.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat MRI at 2 and 6 weeks post-therapy initiation to assess lesion resolution; lack of >25% reduction by week 2 suggests need for biopsy. Continue maintenance therapy with TMP-SMX until CD4 >200 cells/\u00b5L for >6 months on ART. Monitor for relapse\u2014occurs in 20\u201330% if prophylaxis is stopped prematurely. Regular neurologic examinations and MRI every 3\u20136 months in high-risk individuals.","clinical_pearls":"1. In HIV patients with multiple ring-enhancing lesions, always check serum Toxoplasma IgG before invasive testing. 2. A negative Toxoplasma IgG has a high negative predictive value (>95%) and effectively rules out toxoplasmosis. 3. Empiric anti-toxoplasma therapy should precede brain biopsy unless clinical instability mandates urgent tissue diagnosis. 4. Primary CNS lymphoma may mimic toxoplasmosis but often shows solitary periventricular lesions and elevated CSF EBV PCR. 5. Prophylaxis with TMP-SMX in patients with CD4 <100 cells/\u00b5L prevents both Pneumocystis pneumonia and toxoplasmic encephalitis.","references":["1. Antinori A, et al.
