[{"question_number":"2","question":"A 7-year-old boy playing PlayStation all night has facial twitching and right arm movements. The patient cannot speak during the seizure, and postictally he complains of right upper limb numbness. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Landau-Kleffner syndrome","Centrotemporal epilepsy"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Centrotemporal epilepsy","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B is correct because benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (rolandic epilepsy) classically presents in a 7-year-old with nocturnal focal seizures affecting the face and upper limb, speech arrest during the event, and transient postictal Todd paralysis. Option A (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) is incorrect as it is characterized by acquired aphasia and continuous spike-and-wave activity during sleep rather than focal motor seizures with preserved baseline language and motor function between events.","conceptual_foundation":"Rolandic epilepsy is a benign idiopathic focal epilepsy of childhood classified under focal epilepsies in the ILAE 2017 classification. It typically begins between ages 3 and 13, peaks at 7\u20138 years, and features centrotemporal spikes on interictal EEG, reflecting hyperexcitability in the lower sensorimotor cortex controlling the face and hand. Differential diagnoses include Panayiotopoulos syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and benign occipital epilepsy of childhood.","pathophysiology":"The underlying mechanism involves transient hyperexcitability of neurons in the rolandic cortex (primary sensorimotor cortex), likely related to maturational delays in inhibitory GABAergic circuits. Interictal centrotemporal spikes correspond to paroxysmal depolarization shifts in these neurons, producing focal motor manifestations.","clinical_manifestation":"Seizures often occur during sleep or upon awakening, with facial twitching, speech arrest, drooling, and clonic movements of the contralateral hand or arm. Postictal hemiparesis (Todd paralysis) of the involved limb is seen in up to 15% of seizures. Children remain neurologically normal between seizures.","diagnostic_approach":"EEG performed during wakefulness and sleep demonstrates characteristic high-amplitude centrotemporal spikes activated by drowsiness and stage 2 sleep. Brain MRI is typically normal and is reserved for atypical features. Family history may reveal similar benign epilepsies.","management_principles":"Many children require no treatment due to infrequent seizures and benign course. If seizures are frequent or disruptive, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, or sulthiame can be started. Dosing is weight-based with gradual titration to minimize side effects.","follow_up_guidelines":"Periodic follow-up every 6\u201312 months includes assessment of seizure control, side effects, and EEG if clinical features change. Most patients remit by adolescence (age <16 years).","clinical_pearls":"1. Rolandic epilepsy often presents with facial twitching and speech arrest. 2. Centrotemporal spikes on EEG are diagnostic. 3. Todd paralysis can mimic stroke in children. 4. Nocturnal predominance is typical. 5. Excellent prognosis with spontaneous remission.","references":"1. Panayiotopoulos CP.

Multiple randomized trials and cohort studies have demonstrated that vigabatrin achieves electroclinical remission in approximately 60\u201380% of TSC-related infantile spasms, compared to 40\u201360% with hormonal therapies (Knudsen et al. 2018; Chiron et al. 2000). ACTH and corticosteroids are effective in non-TSC cases but carry greater systemic risks and lower efficacy specifically in TSC. Vigabatrin\u2019s mechanism\u2014irreversible inhibition of GABA-transaminase\u2014directly targets the hyperexcitable cortical tubers in TSC, restoring inhibitory tone. ACTH (option A) and corticosteroids (option B) have broader anti-inflammatory effects but lack the targeted GABAergic modulation that underlies vigabatrin\u2019s superior response in this subgroup.","conceptual_foundation":"Infantile spasms (West syndrome) are an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by spasms in clusters, hypsarrhythmia on EEG, and developmental arrest or regression. TSC is an autosomal dominant disorder due to TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, leading to mTOR pathway dysregulation and formation of cortical tubers which are epileptogenic. Under ICD-11, West syndrome is coded under 8A61.0, and TSC under 8A61.1. Differential diagnoses include metabolic etiologies, structural brain lesions, and other genetic encephalopathies. Understanding this requires knowledge of neuronal migration, cortical development, and GABAergic/ glutamatergic balance in the immature brain.","pathophysiology":"Normal infancy brain circuits maintain excitatory\u2013inhibitory balance via GABAergic interneurons. In TSC, hamartin-tuberin complex loss leads to mTOR hyperactivation, abnormal neuronal proliferation, and cortical tubers. These tubers generate epileptiform discharges and hypsarrhythmia. Vigabatrin increases synaptic GABA by irreversibly inhibiting GABA-transaminase, countering hyperexcitability. In contrast, ACTH modulates the HPA axis and corticosteroids reduce inflammation but do not directly augment GABAergic tone.","clinical_manifestation":"TSC-related infantile spasms typically present between 4 and 8 months with clusters of flexor or extensor spasms, developmental plateau or regression, and characteristic chaotic EEG (hypsarrhythmia). Cutaneous signs (hypomelanotic macules, angiofibromas), renal angiomyolipomas, and cardiac rhabdomyomas support a TSC diagnosis.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes contrast brain MRI to detect cortical tubers and subependymal nodules and video-EEG to confirm hypsarrhythmia. Genetic testing for TSC1/TSC2 mutations is recommended (AAN guidelines, level B). Ophthalmologic assessment is needed prior to vigabatrin initiation.","management_principles":"Vigabatrin starting dose is 50 mg/kg/day, titrated to 100\u2013150 mg/kg/day over 1\u20132 weeks. Visual field testing every 3\u20136 months is mandatory due to risk of peripheral visual field constriction (20\u201330% risk at 2 years). Hormonal therapy with low-dose prednisolone or ACTH is considered if vigabatrin fails or is contraindicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow-up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment initiation with developmental assessments, EEG monitoring, MRI surveillance for TSC lesions, and ophthalmologic exams every 6 months. Adjust therapy based on seizure control and side effects.","clinical_pearls":"1. Vigabatrin is first-line for TSC-associated infantile spasms; 2. Always perform baseline and serial visual field testing; 3. Early treatment (<1 month from onset) improves developmental outcome; 4. Cortical tubers on MRI correlate with seizure focus; 5. Genetic confirmation of TSC guides family counseling.","references":"1. Knudsen HL, et al. Efficacy of Vigabatrin in TSC\u2010related Infantile Spasms.

Multiple pharmacokinetic studies (e.g., Patsalos et al., 2013) show that co\u2010administration increases phenytoin serum concentrations by 10\u201330%. There are no other options to compare, and this interaction is well documented in AAN guidelines (2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Both drugs are antiepileptic agents. Phenytoin is eliminated hepatically by CYP2C9/19 and glucuronidation; valproate is primarily metabolized by hepatic \u03b2\u2010oxidation and glucuronidation. When combined, valproate\u2019s inhibition of glucuronidation reduces phenytoin clearance. Understanding basic hepatic enzyme pathways and drug\u2013drug interactions is key.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, phenytoin is metabolized by CYP450 and UGT enzymes in the liver, maintaining stable plasma levels. Valproic acid competitively inhibits UGT1A9 and CYP2C9, reducing phenytoin clearance; the rise in free phenytoin can lead to toxicity (nystagmus, ataxia). This mechanism explains dosage adjustments required when initiating or discontinuing valproate.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients on both medications may develop signs of phenytoin toxicity\u2014horizontal nystagmus, gait disturbance, cognitive slowing\u2014especially when valproate is added. Serum phenytoin >20 \u00b5g/mL correlates with toxicity 80% of the time, rising to >30 \u00b5g/mL in severe cases.","diagnostic_approach":"Monitor total and free phenytoin levels at baseline and weekly after adding valproate. Therapeutic total levels: 10\u201320 \u00b5g/mL; free levels: 1\u20132 \u00b5g/mL. A rise >15% from baseline warrants dose reduction. Use steady\u2010state sampling (after 5 elimination half\u2010lives).","management_principles":"If phenytoin level rises, reduce phenytoin dose by 25\u201350% and recheck levels in 5 days. Titrate to maintain free levels within therapeutic range. Consider switching to non\u2010enzyme\u2010inducing agents if polytherapy is needed.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess phenytoin levels 1\u20132 weeks after dose adjustment and monthly thereafter. Monitor for toxicity signs (neurological exam) and valproate side effects. Adjust therapy based on clinical and laboratory findings.","clinical_pearls":"1. Valproate inhibits phenytoin metabolism via UGT and CYP2C9. 2. Always measure free phenytoin in hypoalbuminemia. 3. Signs of phenytoin toxicity appear when levels exceed 20 \u00b5g/mL. 4. Dose reduction of phenytoin by 25\u201350% is usually sufficient. 5. Consider alternative agents to avoid interaction.","references":"[1] Patsalos PN et al. Epilepsia. 2013;54(1):3\u201317.
