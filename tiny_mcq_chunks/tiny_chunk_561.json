In optic neuritis with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) and negative oligoclonal bands, testing for AQP4-IgG is indicated to confirm NMOSD (Wingerchuk JAMA Neurol 2015). Option B (high-dose steroids) is part of acute management but immunologic workup precedes chronic therapy. Option C (plasma exchange) is reserved for steroid-refractory cases (Class IIa recommendation). Option D (follow-up MRI) alone delays diagnosis and risks relapse.","conceptual_foundation":"NMOSD is classified under \u2018Disorders of the myelin\u2019 in ICD-11. It overlaps clinically with MS but is distinguished by AQP4 autoantibody. LETM (\u22653 vertebral segments) is characteristic. Pathologically, astrocytopathy with complement deposition occurs.","pathophysiology":"AQP4-IgG targets astrocytic water channels, leading to complement-mediated cytotoxicity, secondary demyelination, and neuronal injury. Cytokine release and microglial activation amplify damage.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute optic neuritis presents with painful vision loss; LETM causes bilateral sensory/motor deficits and sphincter dysfunction. Relapses are more frequent and recovery poorer than MS.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI brain and spine demonstrating LETM and optic nerve enhancement; serum AQP4-IgG assay (cell-based assay sensitivity 75\u201390%, specificity >90%).

Long-term: immunosuppression with eculizumab, rituximab or mycophenolate mofetil reduces relapse (PREVENT trial).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor AQP4 titers, annual MRI of brain and spine. Neurological exam every 3\u20136 months. Eye exams with OCT to track optic nerve atrophy.","clinical_pearls":"1) LETM on MRI strongly suggests NMOSD over MS. 2) Negative OCBs favors NMOSD. 3) Early AQP4 testing expedites immunotherapy. 4) Steroid-unresponsive attacks require plasma exchange. 5) Long-term relapse prevention differs from MS.","references":["Wingerchuk DM, et al.

Systemic lupus erythematosus can have neuropsychiatric manifestations but typically features malar rash, arthritis, and renal disease with autoantibodies (anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm) rather than recurrent aphthous ulcers. Multiple sclerosis produces demyelinating lesions leading to optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, or brainstem syndromes but does not cause mucocutaneous ulcers. Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome presents with sicca symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and parotid enlargement; oral ulcers are uncommon and CNS disease is rare. Therefore, option A is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease is a multisystem variable-vessel vasculitis classified under autoinflammatory and vasculitic disorders in ICD-11. It is strongly associated with HLA-B51, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Neurological involvement (Neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s) occurs in approximately 5\u201310% of patients, typically as parenchymal brainstem disease or non-parenchymal venous sinus thrombosis. Key prerequisities include understanding small-vessel vasculitis mechanisms, HLA associations, breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier, and the role of neutrophils and Th17 cells in autoinflammatory disorders.","pathophysiology":"In Neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s, dysregulated innate immunity leads to neutrophil hyperactivation and excessive release of reactive oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes, causing endothelial injury. Th17-mediated cytokines (IL-17, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) promote perivascular inflammation and vessel wall necrosis. Blood\u2013brain barrier disruption permits leukocyte infiltration resulting in parenchymal lesions, particularly in the brainstem. This contrasts with SLE neuro\u00adpathology, which centers on immune complex deposition and complement activation, and MS, which is a T-cell\u2013mediated demyelinating process.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with painful oral aphthae, genital ulcers, and uveitis. Neurological attacks can manifest as acute/subacute headache, hemiparesis, dysarthria, ataxia, or signs of intracranial hypertension if venous thrombosis is present. Parenchymal Neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s often affects the brainstem, basal ganglia, and diencephalon. Natural history without treatment involves recurrent flares with progressive disability over months to years.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on the International Criteria for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease (ICBD), requiring a combination of oral ulcers, genital ulcers, eye lesions, skin lesions, positive pathergy test, and neurological involvement. MRI of the brain typically shows T2 hyperintensities in the brainstem and basal ganglia. CSF analysis reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein. HLA-B51 typing and a positive pathergy test provide supportive evidence. Differential includes MS (oligoclonal bands), CNS vasculitis, sarcoidosis, and infections.","management_principles":"Acute Neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s flares are treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3\u20135 days) followed by an oral prednisone taper. For maintenance and relapse prevention, immunosuppressants such as azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg/day), methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or anti\u2013TNF agents (infliximab) are used. EULAR guidelines (2018) recommend azathioprine as first-line for parenchymal disease (Class IIa, Level B).","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurological assessment and brain MRI every 6\u201312 months to monitor lesion evolution. Laboratory monitoring includes complete blood count, liver and renal panels every 3 months while on immunosuppression.

Natalizumab is an \u03b14-integrin antagonist that prevents lymphocyte migration across the blood\u2013brain barrier; anti-natalizumab antibodies reduce efficacy and can precipitate infusion reactions. Acute relapse management remains unaffected by anti-drug antibody status and focuses on suppressing CNS inflammation with corticosteroids.","pathophysiology":"MS relapses result from focal perivenular infiltration of autoreactive T cells and macrophages leading to demyelination and axonal injury. High-dose steroids stabilize the blood\u2013brain barrier, inhibit inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1, TNF-\u03b1), and reduce edema. In refractory cases, plasma exchange removes pathogenic antibodies and immune complexes.","clinical_manifestation":"Relapses present as new or worsening neurological symptoms lasting >24 hours: motor weakness, sensory changes, optic neuritis, ataxia, brainstem signs.
