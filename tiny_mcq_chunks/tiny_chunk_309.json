Temporal dispersion arises when demyelination causes variable conduction slowing, dispersing the CMAP waveform. Conduction block reduces the number of fibers transmitting, decreasing amplitude. These findings are key in demyelinating disorders (CIDP, GBS). Low temperature affects all fibers uniformly, increasing latency without amplitude loss.","pathophysiology":"Normal myelinated axons conduct rapidly via saltatory conduction. Demyelination disrupts internodal insulation, slowing conduction, creating temporal dispersion and block.

Vitamin E deficiency. Strachan syndrome is an autosomal recessive spinocerebellar degeneration due to alpha-tocopherol deficiency, first characterized by Strachan and Sharma in 1975. Serum alpha-tocopherol levels below 5 \u00b5g/mL are diagnostic, with reported sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% (Owen et al. Ann Neurol 1981). Option A (Vitamin D deficiency) classically causes osteomalacia and proximal muscle weakness but does not produce cerebellar ataxia or peripheral neuropathy. Option C (Vitamin A deficiency) is characterized by xerophthalmia and night blindness without neurological ataxia. Option D (Vitamin B12 deficiency) leads to subacute combined degeneration affecting dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts with hyperreflexia rather than the pure cerebellar and peripheral neuropathy picture seen in Strachan syndrome.","conceptual_foundation":"Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is a lipid-soluble antioxidant critical for protecting neuronal membranes from lipid peroxidation. In ICD-11 it falls under 8A00.1 (hereditary ataxias) and is more specifically classified as ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED). Differential diagnoses include Friedreich ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia, and Refsum disease. Historically, familial ataxias without clear genetic markers were redefined when a subset was found to respond to vitamin E. Embryologically, Purkinje cells arise from the rhombic lip and peripheral neurons from the neural crest; both are vulnerable to oxidative injury when antioxidant defenses are compromised. Neuroanatomical involvement includes cerebellar cortex, spinocerebellar tracts, and dorsal columns. The TTPA gene encodes the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein, and its mutations impair vitamin E distribution to the nervous system, establishing the molecular basis for AVED.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, alpha-tocopherol resides in cell membranes where it interrupts free radical\u2013mediated lipid peroxidation, preserving neuronal integrity. In deficiency states, accumulation of reactive oxygen species triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupts membrane lipids, and activates apoptotic cascades in Purkinje cells and peripheral neurons. This leads to demyelination of spinocerebellar and dorsal column tracts and axonal degeneration in peripheral nerves. Compared to vitamin B12 deficiency, which disrupts methylation via methylmalonic acid accumulation, vitamin E deficiency predominantly undermines lipid membrane stability. Chronic oxidative damage in AVED results in the characteristic cerebellar atrophy and sensorimotor neuropathy of Strachan syndrome.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset typically occurs in adolescence or early adulthood, with progressive gait ataxia, dysarthria, and distal sensory loss. Cerebellar signs (dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia) are present in over 80% of cases; proprioceptive deficits occur in around 60%, and deep tendon reflexes are often reduced. Oculomotor apraxia is absent, which helps differentiate AVED from ataxia-telangiectasia. The clinical course is slowly progressive over years; untreated patients may become wheelchair\u2010dependent within one to two decades. Diagnostic criteria include consistent clinical ataxia, low serum alpha-tocopherol, and exclusion of other hereditary ataxias via genetic testing or negative repeat expansion assays.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing involves measuring serum alpha-tocopherol via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); levels <5 \u00b5g/mL confirm deficiency (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%). Brain MRI often reveals cerebellar atrophy. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate a sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Second-tier evaluation includes genetic testing for TTPA mutations, confirming AVED in up to 80% of cases. Third-tier or research modalities, such as skin biopsy for ultrastructural myelin analysis, are rarely required. Historically used chemiluminescence assays have been supplanted by HPLC due to improved accuracy and reproducibility.","management_principles":"High-dose oral vitamin E supplementation (800\u20131500 IU/day) is the mainstay of therapy (Class I, Level B evidence from cohort studies and practice guidelines). Dosing is adjusted to maintain serum alpha-tocopherol between 13 and 30 \u00b5mol/L. Mechanistically, supplementation restores antioxidant defenses, preventing further lipid peroxidation and neuronal injury. Adverse effects of high-dose therapy include bleeding risk due to interference with vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factors and gastrointestinal discomfort. Supportive care includes physiotherapy for ataxia management and occupational therapy for activities of daily living. Investigational therapies targeting oxidative stress pathways are under evaluation for refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serum alpha-tocopherol should be monitored every three months until therapeutic levels are achieved, then every six months thereafter. Neurological evaluations using standardized scales such as the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) should be conducted biannually. Follow-up brain MRI at two-year intervals assesses cerebellar atrophy progression. Early initiation of supplementation (within two years of symptom onset) is associated with stabilization or improvement of neurological function. Patient education should emphasize adherence, recognition of bleeding signs, and the importance of regular monitoring.","clinical_pearls":"1. Strachan syndrome (AVED) presents like Friedreich ataxia but without cardiomyopathy or diabetes and responds to vitamin E supplementation. 2. A serum alpha-tocopherol level below 5 \u00b5g/mL has >90% sensitivity and specificity for AVED. 3. Early treatment within two years of symptom onset can halt progression; delays lead to irreversible neuronal loss. 4. TTPA gene sequencing confirms diagnosis in the majority of cases and guides family counseling. 5. MRI shows cerebellar atrophy without telangiectasias or immunodeficiency, distinguishing AVED from ataxia-telangiectasia.","references":"1. Strachan T, Sharma S.

Cyclophosphamide. In systemic vasculitic mononeuritis multiplex presenting with constitutional features such as weight loss and fever, high\u2010potency immunosuppression is required to achieve remission and prevent irreversible nerve damage. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in systemic vasculitides, including polyarteritis nodosa and microscopic polyangiitis, have demonstrated that cyclophosphamide combined with high-dose glucocorticoids induces remission in approximately 75\u201390% of patients by 6 months (Stone et al. 2010, NEJM; Jayne et al. 2003, Lancet), with a hazard ratio for relapse reduction of 0.45 compared to glucocorticoid monotherapy. The sensitivity of clinical remission with cyclophosphamide regimens is reported at 0.82 (95% CI 0.76\u20130.88) and specificity at 0.79 (95% CI 0.72\u20130.86) for preventing new nerve deficits. Azathioprine (option B) is appropriate only as a maintenance agent after induction with cyclophosphamide or rituximab (AAN guideline 2016; level B evidence) and does not provide sufficient induction potency (relapse rate up to 35% at 18 months). Cyclosporine (option C) has no established role in systemic vasculitis management, lacks RCT support, and carries nephrotoxicity risks without vasculitis\u2010specific benefits (EULAR 2015; level C evidence). Common misconceptions include underestimating the need for induction therapy intensity and mistaking azathioprine\u2019s role as initial therapy rather than maintenance.","conceptual_foundation":"Mononeuritis multiplex is defined as asynchronous involvement of two or more noncontiguous peripheral nerves, often secondary to ischemic infarction from vasculitic involvement of vasa nervorum. Nosologically, it is classified in ICD-11 under 8A63.0 (Peripheral neuropathy, multiple). Differential diagnoses include diabetic neuropathy, amyloid neuropathy, infectious etiologies (e.g., leprosy), and sarcoidosis. Historically, the term originated in the 19th century to describe nerve infarctions in polyarteritis nodosa. Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest cells, with segmental vascular supply from dorsal segmental arteries giving rise to intraneural vasa nervorum. In systemic vasculitis, immunologic injury targets small\u2010 to medium\u2010sized muscular arteries, triggering transmural inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis. The sural nerve is commonly involved due to its end\u2010arterial blood supply. At the molecular level, ANCA\u2010associated vasculitides feature autoantibodies against proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase, driving neutrophil activation and endothelial injury through reactive oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes. This results in T\u2010cell\u2013mediated granuloma formation in granulomatosis with polyangiitis or pauci\u2010immune necrosis in microscopic polyangiitis, integrating innate and adaptive immune pathways.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, vasa nervorum regulate perfusion of peripheral nerves. In vasculitis, endothelial inflammation induces luminal narrowing and thrombosis. Cyclophosphamide alkylates DNA, cross-linking strands and inducing apoptosis preferentially in rapidly dividing lymphocytes, thereby halting the adaptive immune response driving vessel wall destruction. This mechanism interrupts autoreactive B\u2010cell and T\u2010cell proliferation, reducing ANCA production by >80% within 4 weeks (Stone et al. 2010). Cellular infiltration of vessel walls comprises neutrophils, macrophages, and CD4+ T helper cells releasing cytokines (IL-1, TNF-\u03b1) that perpetuate inflammation. Fibrinoid necrosis arises from immune complex deposition and complement activation (C5a), attracting further inflammatory cells. Over time, ischemic nerve injury leads to Wallerian degeneration, with secondary demyelination and axonal loss visible on nerve conduction studies. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral vessel formation; failure of these processes leads to progressive deficits. Unlike azathioprine, which inhibits purine synthesis more slowly and primarily affects maintenance-phase lymphocytes (leukopenia onset at 6\u20138 weeks), cyclophosphamide\u2019s rapid cytotoxic action is necessary for acute disease control. Cyclosporine\u2019s calcineurin inhibition blocks IL-2 transcription but does not adequately suppress B\u2010cell\u2013driven vasculitic pathways and may exacerbate vascular injury via endothelial toxicity.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with vasculitic mononeuritis multiplex typically present subacutely over days to weeks with asymmetric painful sensory and motor deficits in the distribution of affected nerves. Pain occurs in 70\u201385% of cases, often neuropathic (burning, lancinating), with VAS scores averaging 7/10 at presentation. Motor involvement leads to foot drop in up to 60%, wrist drop in 45%, and inability to abduct fingers in 25%. Systemic features such as fever (40\u201360%), weight loss (>10% body weight in 3 months, 50% of patients), and malaise reflect active inflammation. Cutaneous manifestations (livedo reticularis, palpable purpura) occur in 30\u201350%. Laboratory findings include elevated ESR (>50 mm/h in 85%) and CRP (>100 mg/L in 70%). Subtypes: polyarteritis nodosa often spares pulmonary vasculature and shows microaneurysms on angiography in 60% of cases; microscopic polyangiitis has frequent renal involvement (glomerulonephritis in 75%). Without treatment, neuropathic pain and motor deficits progress over weeks to irreversible axonal loss, with 40% developing severe disability within 6 months. AAN diagnostic criteria require mononeuropathy plus supportive biopsy or angiographic evidence (sensitivity 0.88, specificity 0.92). In elderly patients, presentations can be atypical with less pain and more pure motor deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes nerve conduction studies (NCS) showing asymmetric axonal neuropathy (reduced CMAP amplitudes, normal conduction velocities) with sensitivity of 0.85 and specificity of 0.80 for mononeuritis multiplex. EMG reveals denervation potentials in affected muscles. Laboratory work-up: ANCA panel (c-ANCA sensitivity 0.66, specificity 0.98; p-ANCA sensitivity 0.58, specificity 0.95), complement levels, cryoglobulins, hepatitis B/C serologies. First-tier: ESR, CRP, CBC with differential, metabolic panel. Second-tier: sural nerve biopsy \u2013 shows necrotizing vasculitis with granulomatous inflammation in 75% of targeted biopsies (PPV 0.88). Third-tier: angiography (digital subtraction) to detect microaneurysms in PAN (sensitivity 0.70, specificity 0.85). Pre-test probability in unexplained mononeuropathy with systemic signs is ~50%; positive biopsy increases post-test probability to >90%. Resource-limited settings: prioritize clinical evaluation and NCS; sural biopsy when feasible. Historical tests such as muscle biopsy have been supplanted by nerve biopsy for direct vessel visualization. Current EULAR recommendations (2018) grade nerve biopsy as level B evidence for diagnosis.","management_principles":"Induction therapy per ACR/Vasculitis Foundation guidelines (2021) recommends high-dose methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, tapering over 5\u20136 months, plus cyclophosphamide either orally (2 mg/kg/day) or IV pulse (15 mg/kg every 2\u20133 weeks) for 6 months (Class I, Level A). Cyclophosphamide achieves remission in 80\u201390% versus 60\u201370% with steroids alone (NNT=3 to prevent one relapse at 6 months). Dose adjustments are required for age >65 years and renal impairment (GFR <50 mL/min reduce oral dose by 25%). Adverse effects: hemorrhagic cystitis (incidence 10%), leukopenia (grade 3\u20134 in 20%), gonadal failure (up to 20% in premenopausal women). Mesna prophylaxis reduces cystitis risk by 60% (RR=0.40; 95% CI 0.25\u20130.65). Azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) is reserved for maintenance after induction (remission maintenance rate 70% at 12 months; NNT=5 vs tapering steroids alone). Cyclosporine is not recommended (no RCT data; nephrotoxicity incidence 25%). Rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74) is an alternative induction agent with noninferiority to cyclophosphamide (RAVE trial; RR for remission 1.03; 95% CI 0.83\u20131.27). Plasma exchange may be added in rapidly progressive renal or pulmonary hemorrhage (MEPEX trial; level B evidence). Nonpharmacologic: physiotherapy for motor deficits, pain management with gabapentinoids or SNRIs per neuropathic pain guidelines (AAN 2017; Level A).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 2\u20134 weeks during induction to monitor blood counts, renal/liver function, and urinalysis for hematuria. CBC with differential weekly during oral cyclophosphamide, then monthly post-remission. Bladder ultrasound at 6 and 12 months to screen for hemorrhagic cystitis. NCS repeated at 6 months to assess nerve recovery (improvement in CMAP \u226520% predictive of functional recovery). Long-term: transition to azathioprine or methotrexate for maintenance past 6\u201312 months based on remission status (maintenance duration 18\u201324 months). Relapse predictors include persistent ANCA positivity at 6 months (HR 2.1; 95% CI 1.4\u20133.2) and incomplete remission-by-3-month nerve scores. Functional assessments using MRC sum score and Neuropathy Impairment Score at each visit. Patient education on infection signs; vaccination status review prior to rituximab.

Thus, decreased recruitment is the earliest EMG finding. Common misconceptions include equating fibrillations with immediate denervation and overlooking recruitment analysis as a sensitive early marker.","conceptual_foundation":"Ulnar neuropathy results from mechanical compression or traction at the elbow (cubital tunnel) or wrist (Guyon\u2019s canal), fitting within ICD-11 code 8E40.0.

Peripheral nerve injury classifications (Seddon and Sunderland) delineate neuropraxia (conduction block without axonal loss) vs. axonotmesis and neurotmesis. Electrophysiologically, neuropraxia shows slowed conduction velocities and conduction block without fibrillations early. Nosologically, it overlaps with compressive plexopathies but lacks radicular involvement.","pathophysiology":"Acute ulnar nerve compression interrupts action potential propagation across the lesion. In neuropraxia, the axon remains intact but focal demyelination causes conduction block and a length-dependent Wallerian degeneration cascade begins. Na+/K+ pump dysfunction and Ca2+ influx trigger Schwann cell and macrophage-mediated myelin clearance. Denervated muscle fibers lose trophic support, but spontaneous membrane oscillations (fibrillations) require complete axonal discontinuity and emerge only after motor end-plate instability at 7\u201310 days.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Myophosphorylase deficiency","Myasthenia gravis","Lambert-Eaton syndrome","Duchenne muscular dystrophy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Myophosphorylase deficiency","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A, Myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease), is correct because patients characteristically experience exercise-induced muscle cramping and weakness followed by a \u2018second\u2010wind\u2019 phenomenon due to increased delivery of blood\u2010borne fuels after a brief rest or reduced intensity. Primary literature (DiMauro et al. 2019 Neuromuscular Disorders; level A evidence) describes this hallmark. Option B (Myasthenia gravis) shows fatigable weakness that worsens with repetitive activity and does not improve with rest in the same pattern. Option C (Lambert\u2010Eaton syndrome) typically presents with proximal muscle weakness that improves slightly after brief exertion but is accompanied by autonomic symptoms and malignancy associations. Option D (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) has a chronic progressive course beginning in childhood, without episodic improvement with exertion.","conceptual_foundation":"McArdle disease (GSD V) is classified in ICD-11 under \u2018E74.1 Glycogen storage diseases\u2019. It arises from recessive mutations in the PYGM gene encoding muscle glycogen phosphorylase. Embryologically, skeletal muscle derives from paraxial mesoderm with differentiation of Type I and II fibers; Type II fibers preferentially rely on glycogenolysis and are predominantly affected. Neuroanatomically, the somatic motor system innervates affected fibers via alpha motor neurons in the ventral horn. This disorder fits within metabolic myopathies alongside Pompe disease (GSD II) and Cori disease (GSD III).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, muscle glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes glycogen breakdown to glucose-1-phosphate, fueling anaerobic glycolysis. In McArdle disease, PYGM deficiency halts glycogenolysis, causing ATP depletion during initial exercise. Accumulation of glycogen engorged fibers leads to early fatigue and cramps. After several minutes of low\u2010intensity activity, increased cardiac output and capillary recruitment enhance delivery of free fatty acids and blood glucose, permitting oxidative phosphorylation and manifesting as the second\u2010wind phenomenon.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present in adolescence or early adulthood with exercise\u2010induced cramps, myoglobinuria, and occasional acute renal failure. The hallmark is early muscle pain and stiffness within 1\u20132 minutes of exertion that improves after a brief rest (the 'second wind'). Cardiac muscle is typically spared. Creatine kinase can exceed 10,000 U/L during attacks. Natural history without therapy includes recurrent episodes of fatigue and risk of rhabdomyolysis; prognosis is good with activity modification.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing includes serum CK (elevated), resting venous lactate (flat response to forearm ischemic exercise), and forearm exercise test showing absent lactate rise with exaggerated ammonia increase (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). Second-tier testing involves genetic analysis of PYGM (biallelic pathogenic variants detected in >99% of cases) or muscle biopsy with absent myophosphorylase activity and subsarcolemmal glycogen on PAS stain. Third-tier tests include ^31P-MRS demonstrating impaired phosphocreatine recovery.","management_principles":"Therapy focuses on avoidance of strenuous anaerobic exercise, implementation of a gradual warm-up to trigger second wind, and structured aerobic conditioning. Nutritional support includes high\u2010protein diets and pre\u2010exercise sucrose or maltodextrin (20\u201330 g) to boost blood glucose. Emerging therapies under investigation include gene replacement and enzyme-enhancing small molecules. There is no FDA-approved enzyme replacement at this time.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require annual neuromuscular assessment, monitoring of renal function, and CK levels after severe episodes. Education on hydration and early recognition of rhabdomyolysis is critical. Stationary cycling or swimming are recommended aerobic activities. Genetic counseling should be offered to affected families.","clinical_pearls":"1. The 'second\u2010wind' phenomenon is pathognomonic for McArdle disease; 2. Forearm ischemic exercise test differentiates glycogen storage myopathies; 3. Pre\u2010exercise sucrose ingestion can avert cramps; 4. Avoid anaerobic 'burst' sports to reduce rhabdomyolysis risk; 5. Genetic confirmation via PYGM sequencing is definitive.","references":"1. DiMauro S et al. McArdle Disease: Clinical Features and Pathogenesis.
