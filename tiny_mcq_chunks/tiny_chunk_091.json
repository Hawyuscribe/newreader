In patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA, NIHSS \u22643), dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days reduces the risk of recurrent stroke compared to aspirin alone. The CHANCE trial (2013) showed a 32% relative risk reduction in subsequent stroke at 90 days (8.2% vs. 11.7%, P=0.006); the POINT trial (2018) confirmed similar benefit with an increased hemorrhage risk but net clinical benefit in this subgroup. Aspirin alone (A) or clopidogrel alone (B) are less effective in the acute post-TIA period. \u201cNone of the above\u201d (D) would withhold proven therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"TIA represents a transient episode of neurological dysfunction without imaging evidence of infarction, carrying a high early risk of stroke\u2014estimated at 5\u201310% within 7 days, half occurring in first 48 hours. Mechanisms include artery-to-artery embolism, cardiac embolism, and small vessel disease. Early aggressive secondary prevention is critical. Dual antiplatelet therapy addresses platelet activation and aggregation from ruptured atherosclerotic plaques and endothelial injury.","pathophysiology":"Atherosclerotic plaque rupture or endothelial microdisruption in extracranial carotid or intracranial arteries exposes collagen and tissue factor, triggering platelet adhesion via glycoprotein Ib\u2013V\u2013IX and subsequent aggregation via GPIIb/IIIa receptors. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1, reducing thromboxane A2; clopidogrel blocks the P2Y12 ADP receptor. Combined, they inhibit two key pathways in platelet activation, diminishing microthrombus formation that could lead to completed infarction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with TIA typically present with sudden-onset focal deficits\u2014e.g., unilateral numbness, dysarthria, visual disturbance\u2014fully resolving within 24 hours by definition. Minor stroke (NIHSS \u22643) overlaps clinically. Early recurrent events often occur rapidly, underscoring the need for immediate evaluation and treatment. Risk stratification uses the ABCD2 score, but therapy is guided by clinical and imaging findings rather than score alone.","diagnostic_approach":"Urgent brain imaging (noncontrast CT or MRI) identifies infarction and excludes hemorrhage. Vascular imaging (CTA/MRA/carotid ultrasound) evaluates large artery stenosis. Cardiac evaluation (ECG, echocardiography) assesses cardioembolic sources. In minor stroke/TIA, imaging should occur within 24 hours. High-risk TIA (ABCD2 \u22654) warrants inpatient or rapid outpatient evaluation.","management_principles":"Aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days, initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, is recommended (AHA/ASA 2018, Class I, Level A). After 21 days, switch to monotherapy (aspirin or clopidogrel). Statin therapy, blood pressure control, glycemic management, and lifestyle modification are essential long-term. Carotid endarterectomy is indicated for symptomatic carotid stenosis \u226570%.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess at 21 days to discontinue clopidogrel and continue aspirin.

Limit DAPT duration to 21 days to avoid excess bleeding. 3. ABCD2 score helps triage but treatment decisions are driven by imaging and clinical risk. 4.

What is the next step in management?","options":["Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). For patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis of the MCA, aggressive medical management with DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel for 90 days) plus high-intensity statin therapy and blood pressure control has been shown to reduce recurrent stroke risk more effectively than stenting or monotherapy. The SAMMPRIS trial (Chimowitz et al. NEJM 2011;365:993\u20131003) demonstrated a 90-day stroke and death rate of 5.8 % in the medical\u2010management arm versus 14.7 % in the stenting arm (hazard ratio 0.39; 95 % CI 0.18\u20130.81; p=0.013). Clopidogrel monotherapy or aspirin alone in the context of severe stenosis carries higher recurrent event rates (WASID trial, N Engl J Med 2005;352:836\u201345). Stenting is associated with high periprocedural risk (factual error in choosing stenting). Monotherapy with aspirin lacks the early synergistic benefit seen with DAPT (lower platelet aggregation). There is no indication for anticoagulation unless another cardiac source of embolism is present.","conceptual_foundation":"Symptomatic intracranial stenosis of the MCA is classified under ICD-11 8B21.2 as intracranial large artery atherosclerotic disease. The pathogenesis involves atherosclerotic plaque formation in the M1 segment, leading to artery-to-artery embolism or hemodynamic compromise. Differential diagnoses include non\u2010atherosclerotic vasculopathies (vasculitis, Moyamoya disease), dissection, and cardioembolism. Historically, intracranial stenting was explored after carotid stenting success; however, RCT data shifted practice toward medical therapy. The lesion lies within the circle of Willis territory, supplied by MCA penetrating branches; perfusion deficits manifest in the lateral cerebral hemisphere. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking. No significant embryologic variant alters M1 susceptibility.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology\u2014laminar flow through the MCA provides perfusion to lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Atherosclerotic plaque causes luminal narrowing, turbulent flow, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet activation. Over time, intimal lipid deposition, smooth muscle proliferation, and cap rupture lead to in situ thrombosis or distal embolization. Collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomoses may compensate until critical stenosis (>70 %) is reached. DAPT mitigates platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting COX-1 (aspirin) and P2Y12 receptor (clopidogrel), reducing microthrombus formation at the plaque surface. Unlike anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy targets arterial thrombosis pathways. Inflammation via macrophage cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) perpetuates plaque instability, which is not directly addressed by antiplatelet monotherapy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with TIAs or minor strokes\u2014transient hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, or aphasia depending on dominant hemisphere involvement. Recurrent events often occur in the first 90 days after the index event. Natural history without aggressive therapy: ~20 % risk of recurrent stroke within one year (SAMMPRIS medical arm 19 % at one year). Subtypes include borderzone hypoperfusion events (crescendo TIAs) versus embolic cortical strokes. Complete MCA occlusion can lead to massive infarcts, but high-grade stenosis presents with fluctuating deficits. Elderly and hypertensive patients are at higher risk. No prodrome specific to intracranial stenosis beyond TIAs.","diagnostic_approach":"Noninvasive imaging with CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) to identify \u226570 % luminal narrowing (sensitivity 83 %, specificity 93 % for CTA). Transcranial Doppler can screen for high velocities (mean flow velocity >120 cm/s suggestive). Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard (sensitivity/specificity ~98 %). First-tier: CTA/MRA immediately after stroke stabilizes to confirm stenosis. Second-tier: TCD for monitoring and DSA if endovascular intervention considered. Perfusion imaging (CT or MR perfusion) assesses hemodynamic compromise. Pretest probability based on neurologic exam and vascular risk factors should guide imaging. In resource-limited settings, TCD plus noncontrast CT may suffice for initial assessment.","management_principles":"First-tier: DAPT with aspirin 81 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 90 days (Class I, Level A; AHA/ASA 2014 guidelines). High-intensity statin (atorvastatin 80 mg) irrespective of baseline LDL (Class I, Level A). BP target <140/90 mmHg (<130/80 mmHg if diabetic). Second-tier: consider cilostazol in Asian populations (based on CSPS trial). Third-tier: stenting only if recurrent events despite optimal medical therapy and anatomy suitable (Wingspan stent). Lifestyle: smoking cessation, diet, exercise. No role for warfarin or DOAC in isolated intracranial stenosis without atrial source.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up at 30, 90, and 180 days to monitor recurrent events. Repeat vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) at 3 months to assess progression or restenosis. Lipid panel every 3 months until LDL <70 mg/dL. Blood pressure monitoring weekly until stable. Hematologic labs (CBC, LFTs) at 1 month after DAPT initiation. Neurologic scales (NIHSS, mRS) at each visit. Rehabilitation referrals for residual deficits. Modify therapy if recurrent TIAs occur despite adherence.","clinical_pearls":"1. SAMMPRIS changed practice: most intracranial stenosis is best managed medically with DAPT for 90 days rather than stenting. 2. DAPT duration is limited to 90 days to balance ischemic benefit versus bleeding risk. 3. CTA is highly sensitive and specific for MCA stenosis\u2014use as first\u2010line after stabilization. 4. High-intensity statin therapy reduces plaque progression irrespective of baseline LDL. 5.
