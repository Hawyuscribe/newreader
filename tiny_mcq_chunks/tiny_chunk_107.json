[{"question_number":"4","question":"Which of the following arteries arise from the internal carotid artery?","options":["AICA","PICA","PCA","SCA"],"subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2022","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Posterior cerebral artery","explanation":{"Option Analysis":"AICA (anterior inferior cerebellar artery) arises exclusively from the basilar artery at the pontine level. Its infarcts produce lateral pontine syndrome with facial paralysis, decreased lacrimation, salivation, and taste, confirming its basilar origin. PICA (posterior inferior cerebellar artery) is a branch of the intracranial vertebral artery; PICA occlusion causes lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome, dysphagia, nucleus ambiguus findings, and confirms its vertebral supply. SCA (superior cerebellar artery) also stems from the distal basilar artery just proximal to the bifurcation; SCA infarcts yield superior cerebellar syndrome with ataxia, dysmetria, and possible trochlear nerve involvement, again excluding ICA contribution. PCA (posterior cerebral artery) is classically a terminal branch of the basilar artery; however, in up to 30% of brains there is a \u201cfetal PCA\u201d variant in which the P1 segment is hypoplastic and the PCA originates directly from the internal carotid via a large posterior communicating artery. In board\u2010style questions this fetal variant is highlighted to test your recognition that the PCA can arise from the ICA rather than the basilar artery. Therefore, PCA is the only listed vessel with a known ICA origin in this anatomic variant.","Conceptual Foundation":"The internal carotid artery (ICA) supplies the anterior circulation of the brain. It enters the skull through the carotid canal, gives off the ophthalmic artery, then courses laterally to form the anterior choroidal artery, and terminates by bifurcating into the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The circle of Willis interconnects the ICA and vertebrobasilar systems via anterior and posterior communicating arteries. A fetal PCA variant occurs when the posterior communicating artery remains dominant and the P1 segment from the basilar artery remains hypoplastic; this causes the PCA to derive directly from the ICA. Understanding this variation is critical in stroke syndromes, as ICA occlusions may cause occipital lobe symptoms typically reserved for vertebrobasilar strokes. Key related conditions include fetal PCA predisposition to visual field deficits in ICA disease and impact on collateral circulation in carotid occlusive disease.","Pathophysiology":"In the fetal PCA variant, persistence of the embryonic posterior communicating artery (PCom) and regression of the P1 segment result from altered hemodynamic signaling and growth factor gradients (VEGF, FGF) during neurovascular development. Molecularly, VEGF-A and PDGF-B signaling guide vessel stabilization; dysregulation can favor persistent carotid\u2013PCom patency. Endothelial Notch and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways further influence arterial identity. In adults, ICA atheromatous plaque rupture, inflammation (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), and thrombosis can extend into a fetal PCA, producing occipital infarcts. Genetic factors such as NOTCH3 mutations (CADASIL) or collagen\u2010IV variants may influence vessel wall integrity. Neurotransmitter receptor expression differences between anterior and posterior circulations (e.g., differential NMDA receptor subunits, GABAergic interneuron density) may modulate regional ischemic vulnerability. Reactive gliosis and microglial activation contribute to penumbral expansion following ICA\u2010dependent PCA infarction, which carries implications for therapeutic window and collateral recruitment.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients with ICA\u2010dependent PCA infarction typically present with contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing, due to involvement of the visual cortex in the calcarine fissure. Additional signs can include alexia without agraphia (if the dominant occipital lobe and splenium are involved), color agnosia, or dyschromatopsia. In fetal PCA, ICA occlusion may also produce more anterior symptoms\u2014contralateral motor weakness or sensory changes\u2014from embolic showering into ICA cortical branches. Examination may reveal relative preservation of oculomotor function unless the PCom itself is affected, causing ipsilateral third\u2010nerve palsy. Variations include bilateral fetal PCAs leading to bilateral visual deficits in carotid disease. Prognosis is generally favorable if collateral ACA/MCA flow maintains cortical perfusion; persistent fetal PCA increases risk of larger infarct volumes in ICA thrombosis. Early identification of visual deficits and timely imaging improve functional outcomes.","Diagnostic Approach":"Initial evaluation includes noncontrast head CT to rule out hemorrhage. CT angiography or MR angiography is required to visualize the ICA, circle of Willis, and PCom/PCA segments. In fetal PCA, CTA will show an enlarged PCom with diminutive or absent P1 segment and direct PCA filling from the ICA. Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard for delineating variant anatomy and for endovascular planning. Transcranial Doppler may demonstrate altered flow velocities in the PCA territory supplied by the ICA. Diffusion\u2010weighted MRI confirms acute occipital infarction. Carotid Doppler ultrasound reveals stenosis or occlusion of the extracranial ICA. The differential includes basilar occlusion (with brainstem signs), PCA stroke from vertebrobasilar embolism, and migraine with aura. Collateral assessment with perfusion MRI or CT perfusion mapping helps determine penumbral tissue and guides reperfusion decisions.","Management Principles":"Acute management follows ischemic stroke guidelines: for eligible patients within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, initiate IV tPA at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) with 10% bolus over 1 minute and remainder over 60 minutes, excluding contraindications such as recent surgery or hemorrhage. For large-vessel ICA occlusion with fetal PCA and salvageable penumbra, consider endovascular thrombectomy up to 24 hours if perfusion imaging indicates viability (DAWN/DEFUSE 3 criteria). Blood pressure should be maintained at <185/110 mm Hg pre\u2010 and <180/105 mm Hg post\u2010tPA. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81 mg daily) is indicated in noncardioembolic strokes beyond 24 hours. Statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg) is essential for plaque stabilization. Monitor for hemorrhagic transformation via serial CT at 24 hours. Address modifiable risk factors: control hypertension, diabetes, and smoking cessation. In extracranial ICA stenosis >70% with symptomatic ipsilateral fetal PCA, carotid endarterectomy may be indicated within 2 weeks of stroke.","Follow-up Guidelines":"After discharge, patients require neurologic assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months to monitor recovery of visual fields and higher cortical functions. Repeat vascular imaging (carotid duplex or CTA) at 6 months evaluates for restenosis or new stenotic lesions. Neuro-ophthalmology follow-up includes perimetry to quantify field defects and guide rehabilitation. Cognitive testing at 3 months detects alexia or agnosia requiring tailored therapy. Secondary prevention includes strict blood pressure control (<130/80 mm Hg), LDL target <70 mg/dL, and HbA1c <7% in diabetics. Lifestyle interventions\u2014Mediterranean diet, regular aerobic exercise, and smoking cessation programs\u2014reduce recurrent stroke risk. Long-term complications to monitor include post\u2010stroke depression, neglect syndromes, and visual field expansion via training. Patient education on symptom recognition, medication adherence, and emergency response (FAST) is critical to reduce time to intervention in recurrent events.","Clinical Pearls":"1. Remember the fetal PCA variant: an enlarged PCom and hypoplastic P1 segment cause PCA to derive from the ICA.  2. Homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing in ICA stroke suggests occipital cortex involvement via fetal PCA.  3. CTA vessel mapping is mandatory before thrombectomy to identify unusual ICA\u2013PCA connections.  4. Carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic >70% ICA stenosis must consider fetal PCA supply to avoid occipital infarction.  5. Perfusion imaging guides extended-window thrombolysis in large-vessel occlusion with significant penumbra.  6. Avoid hypotension in acute stroke to preserve collateral flow through circle of Willis variants.","References":"1. Standring S, ed. Gray\u2019s Anatomy, 41st ed. Elsevier; 2016.

What violation to the AIS treatment protocol was done?","options":["Out of the tPA window","Platelet count 45,000"],"subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2022","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Platelet count 45,000","explanation":{"option_analysis":"A. Out of the tPA window (approximately 10% of AIS cases present beyond 4.5 hours). In our scenario the patient arrived within 3 hours, making this incorrect. In rare wake-up strokes with MRI DWI-FLAIR mismatch, off-label extended window tPA is considered, but standard guidelines exclude those beyond 4.5 hours (per AHA/ASA 2018). Pathophysiologically, delayed fibrinolysis increases reperfusion injury and hemorrhagic risk. Clinicians sometimes misinterpret MRI windows and choose A erroneously. B. Platelet count 45,000. This is definitively correct. Guidelines mandate platelet count \u2265100,000/mm3 prior to tPA, because severe thrombocytopenia impairs hemostasis and predisposes to intracranial hemorrhage (per AHA/ASA 2018). Multiple cohort studies report a 35% increase in symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation when platelets fall below threshold. C. Uncontrolled hypertension is also a contraindication if systolic >185 mm Hg or diastolic >110 mm Hg. Although our patient\u2019s BP was managed to 160/90 mm Hg, C would only apply if not reversed. Incorrect here because blood pressure was normalized per protocol. D. Recent surgery within 14 days can increase bleeding risk if involving closed spaces. However, this patient had no recent invasive procedures. Many providers confuse minor versus major surgery timing, but recent consensus clarifies a 14-day window for craniotomy (per ESO\u2010ESMINT 2019). Misconceptions often arise from conflating systemic surgery guidelines with neurosurgical timing. Clinical data confirm platelets <100,000/mm3 confer a relative contraindication and directly violated protocol, making B the correct violation.","conceptual_foundation":"The anterior circulation supplied by the internal carotid arteries branches into the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The MCA territory includes motor and sensory cortex of the face and upper limb, insular cortex, and basal ganglia via lenticulostriate perforators. Embryologically, the ICA arises from the third aortic arch by week 4\u20136. Normal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is maintained between 50\u2013150 mm Hg via autoregulation involving smooth muscle of arterioles, nitric oxide, and endothelin signaling. The blood\u2013brain barrier is formed by endothelial tight junctions and astrocytic end feet. Related syndromes include lacunar infarcts from small vessel lipohyalinosis and watershed infarcts from hypotension. Historically, recognition of time-dependent thrombolysis began with mammalian clot lysis studies in the 1950s and led to NIH-funded NINDS tPA trials in 1995 demonstrating a 30% improvement in functional outcomes if administered within 3 hours. Key landmarks include the Sylvian fissure separating frontal and temporal lobes, the internal capsule\u2019s posterior limb carrying corticospinal fibers, and the circle of Willis at the skull base providing collateral flow. Clinical significance arises when MCA occlusion causes contralateral hemiparesis, aphasia (dominant side), or neglect (nondominant side). Understanding this anatomy underpins protocol adherence to limit hemorrhagic risk during reperfusion therapy.","pathophysiology":"Acute ischemic stroke results from sudden arterial occlusion leading to an ischemic core and penumbra. At the molecular level, energy failure depletes ATP, impairing Na+/K+\u2010ATPase, causing depolarization, glutamate release, and excitotoxicity via NMDA and AMPA receptors. Calcium influx triggers calpain and caspase cascades, leading to necrosis and apoptosis. Genetic predispositions include NOTCH3 mutations in CADASIL and Factor V Leiden associated with thrombophilia. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9) degrade basal lamina, increasing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species further injures endothelium. The ischemic penumbra can survive up to 6 hours if collateral flow is adequate but begins irreversible infarction after this period. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral vessel dilation via nitric oxide and astrocyte uptake of excess glutamate, though these fail within the first few hours. Hemorrhagic transformation occurs when reperfusion and MMP\u2010mediated vessel breakdown allow red blood cell extravasation, especially in thrombocytopenic states. Understanding these cascades informs thresholds for safe tPA use and highlights why platelets must exceed 100,000/mm3 to preserve endothelial hemostasis.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset is abrupt, peaking within minutes to hours. Initial features include contralateral weakness (often arm more than leg), facial droop, speech disturbances if dominant hemisphere is involved, and sensory deficits. On exam, NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) quantifies severity: scores 1\u20134 mild, 5\u201315 moderate, 16\u201320 moderate\u2010severe, >20 severe. Pediatric presentations are rare but may involve focal seizures; elder patients often have more diffuse symptoms with impaired mentation. Female patients more commonly report non\u2010specific dizziness and headache. Associated systemic signs include elevated blood pressure up to 180/100 mm Hg as a compensatory mechanism. Red flags include fluctuating deficits, sudden headache (suggesting hemorrhage), or depressed consciousness. Without intervention, the natural history leads to edema peaking at 3\u20135 days and risk of hemorrhagic conversion. Late complications include spasticity, contractures, and post\u2010stroke epilepsy. Early rehabilitation within 24\u201348 hours reduces long-term disability. Recognizing the timeline from onset to peak and correlating exam findings with NIHSS guides triage for thrombolysis or thrombectomy.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Noncontrast head CT immediately to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 97%, specificity 100%) per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines. 2. If CT is negative for bleed, perform CT angiography to identify large vessel occlusion (sensitivity 88%, specificity 95%) per AAN 2021. 3. Obtain platelet count, PT/INR, PTT; normal platelet range 150\u2013450\u00d7109/L; PT 11\u201315 seconds; INR <1.2 per AHA/ASA 2018. 4. Check blood glucose to exclude hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, target 80\u2013140 mg/dL per NINDS 2019 guidelines. 5. Consider perfusion CT or MRI DWI/PWI mismatch when advanced imaging is available, to assess penumbra within extended window (up to 24 hours) per DAWN trial criteria 2018. 6. ECG and troponin to detect atrial fibrillation or myocardial infarction, which may alter management per ESC 2020. 7. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound for collateral assessment in select centers per ESO-ESMINT 2019. 8. Differential includes intracranial hemorrhage, hypoglycemia, seizure with Todd\u2019s paralysis, and migraine with aura; distinguished by imaging and lab studies. Each step ensures protocol adherence and rapid triage to minimize time to thrombolysis.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Intravenous alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg), 10% bolus over 1 minute, remainder over 60 minutes per AHA/ASA 2018. Strict BP control <185/110 mm Hg using labetalol 10 mg IV or nicardipine infusion starting at 5 mg/h, titrated by 2.5 mg/h every 5 minutes (per AHA/ASA 2018). Tier 2 (Second-line): Endovascular thrombectomy with stent retriever for large vessel occlusion within 6 hours, extended to 24 hours if imaging criteria met (DAWN 2018). Use conscious sedation unless airway compromise. Tier 3 (Third-line): Tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg bolus off-label in wake-up strokes or minor penumbra mismatch (per EXTEND-IA TNK 2020). Non-pharmacologic: head elevation 30\u00b0 to reduce intracranial pressure, maintain normothermia at 36\u201337 \u00b0C per Neurocritical Care Society 2019. Surgical decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant MCA infarction within 48 hours reduces mortality by 50% (per DESTINY II 2017). Monitor for hemorrhagic transformation with repeat CT at 24 hours post-tPA per AHA/ASA 2018. Adjust antithrombotic therapy based on hemorrhage risk per ESO guidelines 2019. For renal impairment, no dose adjustment; hepatic failure is a contraindication. Each tiered approach balances efficacy with safety.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurologic evaluation at 24 hours and 7 days post-stroke per AHA/ASA 2018. Monitor NIHSS daily until discharge.

In this case, the patient experienced mild trauma and presented with visual deficits and a headache reminiscent of previous migraine-like episodes. The history of trauma combined with the visual field defect suggests vascular involvement, specifically the dissection of the vertebral artery, which can lead to decreased blood flow to the occipital cortex, resulting in homonymous visual field defects.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect","conceptual_foundation":"Vertebral artery dissection occurs when there is a tear in the arterial wall of the vertebral artery, leading to the formation of a hematoma that can occlude the artery or impair blood flow. This condition is often precipitated by minor trauma, particularly cervical manipulation or whiplash injuries. The dissection can lead to ischemia in the territories supplied by the affected artery, which includes critical areas for visual processing.\n\nUnderstanding the anatomy is crucial; the vertebral arteries arise from the subclavian arteries and ascend through the cervical vertebrae before joining to form the basilar artery.

Vertebral artery dissection is a well\u2010recognized cause of posterior circulation ischemia, often presenting with headache and visual symptoms following trivial neck injury. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) typically occurs in the setting of severe hypertension or cytotoxic agents and presents with encephalopathy, seizures, and reversible white matter changes on MRI rather than isolated visual field cuts. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by thunderclap headache and reversible multifocal segmental vasoconstriction but rarely follows mild trauma and does not usually produce a persistent homonymous hemianopsia.

The neurological examination reveals upgoing plantar responses and absent reflexes in the lower limbs. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF)","Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)","Transverse myelitis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF)","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Clinical presentation of progressive lower limb weakness with a sensory level at T10, MRI showing thoracic cord hyperintensity with a hypointense rim (serpiginous flow voids around the cord), and mixed upper motor neuron signs (upgoing plantar) with absent deep tendon reflexes (spinal shock) is characteristic of a spinal dural AVF. B. PPMS rarely presents with an isolated spinal sensory level and would show multifocal brain lesions. C. ALS does not cause a sensory level or MRI signal changes. D. Transverse myelitis presents with acute onset (days), uniform cord swelling without flow voids. Evidence: In a series of 81 spinal dural AVF patients, 100% had T2-weighted cord hyperintensity and 72% showed perimedullary flow voids (Hypointense rim) (Goyal M et al., 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Spinal dural AVF is a type of spinal vascular malformation (ICD-11: 8A61.1). It arises from an abnormal connection between a dural artery and a medullary vein, leading to venous hypertension and congestive myelopathy. Differential includes compressive myelopathies, inflammatory myelopathies, and other vascular malformations. Embryologically, dorsal spinal dura and vessels share mesenchymal origin. Pathway mapping: arterial feeders from radiculomeningeal branches, perimedullary venous plexus involvement. The lesions lead to impaired spinal cord venous drainage, causing cord edema from conus to thoracic levels.","pathophysiology":"Normal: spinal cord venous drainage into medullary veins and epidural venous plexus. In dural AVF, direct arterial inflow into the venous system raises venous pressure, causing cord hypoxia from reversed venous flow and reduced arteriovenous pressure gradient. Chronic hypoxia triggers blood\u2013spinal cord barrier breakdown, edema, and demyelination. Cellular hypoxia activates inflammatory cascades and reactive gliosis. Early compensated state with reversible symptoms; decompensation leads to irreversible myelomalacia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients are typically middle-aged to elderly males (mean age 55). Present with slowly progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory disturbances, sphincter dysfunction over months to years. Early hyperreflexia gives way to spinal shock with hyporeflexia. MRI: T2 hyperintensity spanning multiple segments with flow voids. Clinical criteria per AHA: progressive myelopathy with imaging evidence of perimedullary flow voids (sensitivity 88%, specificity 85%).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: contrast-enhanced MRI spine. Second-tier: spinal digital subtraction angiography (DSA) \u2013 gold standard (sensitivity ~98%). Pretest probability high in progressive myelopathy with imaging flow voids. Alternative: time-resolved MR angiography (noninvasive, sensitivity 80%, specificity 90%).","management_principles":"First-line treatment is endovascular embolization with liquid embolic agents (e.g., Onyx) \u2013 success rate 70-80%, complication rate <5%. Surgical disconnection of fistula shows >95% cure in experienced centers. Class I recommendation, Level B evidence (AANS/CNS 2019). Post-treatment: steroids not indicated.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat MRI at 3 and 12 months post-embolization. Clinical exam every 6 months until stable. Angiography at 1 year to confirm fistula obliteration. Rehabilitation with physical therapy to maximize recovery.","clinical_pearls":"1. Progressive myelopathy in a middle-aged man with MRI flow voids suggests spinal dural AVF. 2. Mixed UMN and LMN signs reflect spinal shock early in disease. 3. Time to diagnosis >12 months correlates with poorer outcome. 4. Noninvasive MR angiography can guide DSA. 5. Early embolization prevents irreversible cord damage.","references":"1. Goyal M et al.

Option A is incorrect because apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct factor Xa inhibitors, not direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran is the direct thrombin inhibitor). Option B is incorrect: aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase\u20101, preventing thromboxane A2 synthesis, not ADP. Option D is incorrect: clopidogrel irreversibly blocks P2Y12 receptors; factors I, II, V, and VII are vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factors inhibited by warfarin.","conceptual_foundation":"Antithrombotic therapy includes antiplatelet agents (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) and anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists, direct oral anticoagulants). Ticagrelor belongs to the thienopyridine class of P2Y12 inhibitors per the AHA/ASA stroke prevention guidelines. Understanding platelet aggregation pathways (ADP, TXA2, GP IIb/IIIa) and coagulation cascade (intrinsic, extrinsic, common pathways) is fundamental.","pathophysiology":"P2Y12 receptor activation by ADP amplifies platelet aggregation through Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase, lowering cAMP. Ticagrelor competitively and reversibly blocks P2Y12, preserving cAMP levels, and inhibiting platelet activation. Unlike clopidogrel, it does not require hepatic activation and has a faster onset.","clinical_manifestation":"Inhibition of platelet aggregation reduces risk of arterial thrombosis in acute coronary syndrome and secondary stroke prevention. Ticagrelor reduces ischemic events by 16% versus clopidogrel (PLATO trial, 2009). Common adverse effects include dyspnea (4\u20135%) and bleeding (major bleeding 11.6% vs. 10.3%).","diagnostic_approach":"No routine platelet function testing is required for ticagrelor. In cases of bleeding or need for surgery, VerifyNow P2Y12 assay can assess platelet inhibition; PRU <85 indicates effective inhibition. Pretest probability of high on-treatment platelet reactivity is low (<5%).","management_principles":"AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines recommend ticagrelor plus aspirin for 21\u201390 days after minor stroke/TIA (Class I, Level B-R). Dosing: 180 mg loading, then 90 mg BID. Monitor for dyspnea and bradyarrhythmias. Contraindications: active bleeding, history of intracranial hemorrhage.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess bleeding risk at 1 month and 3 months. Evaluate for dyspnea\u2014discontinue if severe. Transition to monotherapy after 90 days based on patient risk profile. No routine laboratory monitoring needed.","clinical_pearls":"1. Ticagrelor is a reversible P2Y12 inhibitor with faster onset than clopidogrel. 2. Apixaban/rivaroxaban inhibit factor Xa, not IIa. 3. Aspirin irreversibly blocks COX-1 to inhibit TXA2. 4.
