[{"question_number":"2","question":"In a case scenario of an acute ischemic stroke patient, what is a contraindication for administering tPA?","options":["Blood pressure >200 mm Hg","Rapid improvement","Platelet count <150,000/mm\u00b3"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Rapid improvement","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. Rapid improvement. According to the 2018 AHA/ASA acute stroke guidelines (Powers et al., 2018), patients whose deficits have nearly completely resolved (rapid improvement) are excluded from receiving intravenous alteplase because they are likely having a transient ischemic attack or minor stroke with good spontaneous recovery (Class IIa, Level B-R). Option A is incorrect: while uncontrolled blood pressure above 185/110 mm Hg is an exclusion criterion, the threshold is 185/110, not 200 mm Hg; systolic \u2265200 mm Hg per se is not specified (Powers et al., 2018). Option C is incorrect: platelet count <100,000/mm\u00b3 is an exclusion, not <150,000/mm\u00b3. The 100,000 threshold is based on hemorrhagic risk data (Demaerschalk et al., 2016).","conceptual_foundation":"Acute ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion leading to focal cerebral ischemia. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) quantifies severity; minor stroke (NIHSS \u22644) often improves spontaneously. Thrombolytic therapy with alteplase (tPA) within 4.5 hours reduces disability (NINDS Trial, 1995). Eligibility requires absence of hemorrhage on noncontrast head CT and no contraindications (exclusion criteria). These criteria are codified in ICD-11 under 8B01.Z and in the AHA/ASA guidelines. Historically, the first thrombolysis trials (PROACT I/II) established benefit but also hemorrhagic risk, shaping current thresholds for blood pressure, platelet count, and severity of deficits.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion is maintained by autoregulation; occlusion of a cerebral artery causes an ischemic core and surrounding penumbra. Rapid reperfusion with tPA can rescue penumbral tissue but carries hemorrhagic transformation risk if vascular integrity is compromised. In minor or rapidly improving strokes, endogenous fibrinolysis may already be restoring flow. Administering exogenous tPA in this setting confers bleeding risk without significant additional salvageable tissue. Elevated blood pressure worsens edema and risk of hemorrhage, hence thresholds. Thrombocytopenia increases bleeding risk by impairing clot formation.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute ischemic stroke typically presents with sudden focal neurologic deficits: hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, aphasia, visual field cuts. Rapid improvement means near-complete resolution within minutes to hours. Such patients historically have very good outcomes without thrombolysis; NINDS data showed no net benefit in this subgroup but increased hemorrhage risk. Natural history studies show TIA-like events with low residual deficits and low 90-day stroke rates (<10%).","diagnostic_approach":"First, noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%). Obtain urgent labs: platelet count, INR, glucose. Pre-tPA SBP must be \u2264185 mm Hg and DBP \u2264110 mm Hg. If rapid improvement occurs, re-examination and NIHSS scoring confirm exclusion. MRI diffusion\u2013perfusion may help but is not required. CT angiography informs large-vessel occlusion but is secondary to tPA decision in the hyperacute window.","management_principles":"Per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines, IV alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) given within 4.5 hours of onset (Class I, Level A). Exclusion criteria include uncontrolled BP, platelet <100,000/mm\u00b3, INR >1.7, recent surgery, and rapidly improving symptoms. Blood pressure should be lowered with IV labetalol or nicardipine to target \u2264185/110 prior to tPA. After tPA, monitor in ICU or stroke unit with neuro checks every 15 minutes \u00d71 hour, every 30 minutes \u00d76 hours, then hourly until 24 hours.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status and blood pressure; maintain SBP <180/105 mm Hg for 24 hours post-tPA. Obtain follow-up CT at 24 hours before starting antithrombotics. Transition to secondary prevention: aspirin at 24\u201348 hours, statin therapy, and risk factor control (hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation). Rehabilitation should begin as early as possible to optimize functional recovery.","clinical_pearls":"1. Rapid improvement or minor stroke symptoms (<NIHSS 5) exclude tPA\u2014risk of hemorrhage outweighs benefit. 2. BP must be \u2264185/110 before tPA; treat with IV antihypertensives. 3. Platelet count threshold is 100,000/mm\u00b3; mild thrombocytopenia is not exclusionary. 4. CT head must show no hemorrhage; do not delay for CTA if within window. 5. After tPA, maintain stricter BP control (\u2264180/105) and obtain 24-hour CT before anticoagulation.","references":"1.

What should be investigated?","options":["Anti-phospholipid syndrome","Prothrombin Gene Mutation"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Anti-phospholipid syndrome","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Anti-phospholipid syndrome. Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I, and anti-cardiolipin) in association with clinical features of arterial or venous thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity. A history of ischemic stroke in a young female, recurrent early fetal loss (two prior abortions), and abnormal phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests (eg, prolonged dilute Russell\u2019s viper venom time or prolonged aPTT) strongly point to APS. In contrast, prothrombin G20210A mutation (option B) is a hereditary thrombophilia primarily associated with venous thromboembolism and does not typically cause arterial events like ischemic stroke or recurrent pregnancy loss, nor does it prolong phospholipid-dependent clotting assays. Furthermore, the prothrombin mutation results in increased prothrombin levels without prolongation of PT. Common misconceptions include conflating all thrombophilias with APS; however, unlike hereditary thrombophilias (eg, factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation), APS uniquely combines both obstetric and arterial thrombotic manifestations. Current guidelines (Miyakis et al. 2006, ACR 2015) classify definite APS when at least one clinical and one laboratory criterion are met (Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Anti-phospholipid syndrome sits within the category of acquired thrombophilias in the ICD-11 under \u2018D68.61\u2014Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.\u2019 It overlaps with systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective-tissue diseases but can also occur as a primary disorder. Differential diagnoses include hereditary thrombophilias (factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Historically first described by Graham Hughes in 1983, APS diagnostic criteria evolved from Sapporo 1999 to the revised Sydney criteria in 2006. Embryologically, \u03b22-glycoprotein I is synthesized in the liver and circulates in plasma; autoantibodies develop through molecular mimicry and dysregulated tolerance. Neuroanatomically, arterial thromboses in APS often target cerebral vessels\u2014especially the middle cerebral artery distribution\u2014leading to cortical infarcts. \u03b22-glycoprotein I binds to negatively charged phospholipids on endothelial cells and platelets, altering coagulation cascades and activating complement. Genetically, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ haplotypes have been implicated in predisposition. A clear understanding of immunologic tolerance and coagulation physiology underpins APS pathogenesis and its neurologic manifestations.","pathophysiology":"Normal haemostasis depends on an ordered interaction between endothelium, platelets, coagulation factors, and fibrinolysis. In APS, autoantibodies against phospholipid-binding plasma proteins (principally \u03b22-glycoprotein I) bind to endothelial cells, monocytes, and platelets, triggering cell activation via Toll-like receptors and annexin A2, leading to tissue factor expression and thrombin generation. These antibodies also disrupt protein C anticoagulant pathway and inhibit annexin A5 shield formation on phospholipid surfaces. Complement activation (C5a generation) amplifies inflammation and thrombosis. On a molecular level, anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I engages TLR4, inducing NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated upregulation of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1) and procoagulant microparticle release. The net effect is a prothrombotic milieu in both arterial and venous beds. In contrast, prothrombin gene mutation simply increases circulating prothrombin levels by ~30%, raising venous thrombosis risk without the inflammatory component or pregnancy morbidity. Temporal progression in APS may be insidious, with subclinical autoantibody positivity preceding clinical events by years.","clinical_manifestation":"APS clinical features include arterial thromboses (stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction), venous thromboses (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), and pregnancy morbidity (recurrent early miscarriage, fetal death after 10 weeks, preeclampsia). Neurologic involvement occurs in up to 20% of patients, most commonly ischemic stroke in young women (<50 years). Strokes are often cortical, with middle cerebral artery distribution, and can recur. Less frequent are seizures, chorea, transverse myelopathy, and cognitive dysfunction. Obstetric APS presents with \u22653 consecutive miscarriages before 10 weeks or \u22651 fetal death \u226510 weeks. Untreated, APS carries a 30% five-year cumulative risk of recurrent thrombosis. The Revised Sapporo criteria (2006) require \u22651 clinical and \u22651 laboratory criterion (antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions \u226512 weeks apart). Sensitivity of lupus anticoagulant for thrombosis is ~60% and specificity ~90%; anti-cardiolipin IgG has sensitivity ~50% and specificity ~85%.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with coagulation screening: PT/INR is typically normal, whereas aPTT is prolonged by lupus anticoagulant in ~40\u201350% of cases. Confirmatory tests include dilute Russell\u2019s viper venom time and mixing studies. Specific antibody assays (anticardiolipin IgG/IgM ELISA, anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I IgG/IgM ELISA) follow. According to the 2006 Sydney criteria (Level A evidence), diagnosis requires persistence of at least one antiphospholipid antibody at medium/high titer on two occasions \u226512 weeks apart. First-tier: lupus anticoagulant testing, anticardiolipin and anti-\u03b22GPI ELISAs. Second-tier: confirmatory dRVVT, hexagonal phospholipid neutralization. Pre-test probability is elevated in young stroke patients with no conventional risk factors (up to 20% have APS). Negative predictive value of a single negative test is ~90%, but repeat testing is mandatory. Third-tier: complement levels, anti-annexin A2, emerging research assays (e.g., anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin). Genetic thrombophilia panels are not indicated unless venous thrombosis predominates.","management_principles":"Long-term anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (target INR 2.0\u20133.0) is the cornerstone for thrombotic APS (Class I, Level A, AHA/ASA 2019). High-intensity warfarin (INR 3.0\u20134.0) is reserved for recurrent events on standard intensity. Low-dose aspirin (81\u2013100 mg daily) is recommended for primary prevention in high-risk antibody profiles (lupus anticoagulant positive) (Class IIa, Level B). Direct oral anticoagulants are not recommended in high-risk APS with arterial events (TRAPS trial 2018). Obstetric APS requires low-dose aspirin plus prophylactic heparin during pregnancy (Class I, Level B). Adjunctive therapies under study include hydroxychloroquine and statins for their endothelial-protective effects. Immunomodulatory therapies (rituximab, eculizumab) are reserved for catastrophic APS or refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor INR every 4\u20136 weeks once stable; assess adherence and interacting medications at each visit. Repeat antiphospholipid antibody testing at least every 12 months to confirm persistent positivity. Annual screening for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes is critical to reduce vascular risk. In pregnant patients, fetal growth ultrasounds every 4 weeks and maternal anti-Xa levels if on low-molecular-weight heparin. Lifelong anticoagulation is generally recommended after a thrombotic event. Educate patients on bleeding signs, falls prevention, and contraceptive counsel (avoid estrogen\u2010containing contraceptives).","clinical_pearls":"1. Young stroke + recurrent miscarriages = think APS, not hereditary thrombophilia. 2. Lupus anticoagulant prolongs aPTT but confers thrombosis risk\u2014don\u2019t be misled by \u2018anticoagulant.\u2019 3. APS requires persistent antibody positivity \u226512 weeks apart \u2013 single test insufficient. 4. DOACs are contraindicated in high-risk APS with arterial events per TRAPS trial. 5.

No other options were provided for consideration.","conceptual_foundation":"Intravenous thrombolysis with t-PA remains the cornerstone of reperfusion therapy for eligible acute ischemic stroke patients. The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) quantifies stroke severity; scores \u22651 with disabling features indicate candidacy for t-PA.

Thrombolysis is indicated up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset when imaging excludes hemorrhage and contraindications (e.g., recent surgery, bleeding diathesis).","pathophysiology":"Ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion, causing energy failure, excitotoxicity, and cytotoxic edema. The ischemic penumbra surrounds the irreversibly injured core; timely reperfusion salvages penumbral tissue. Alteplase promotes fibrinolysis by converting plasminogen to plasmin, dissolving the clot, restoring cerebral blood flow, and limiting infarct growth. Therapeutic benefit declines with every minute of delay (time-dependent efficacy).","clinical_manifestation":"Disabling deficits\u2014dysarthria and hemiparesis\u2014persist despite partial recovery of NIHSS.

Which vascular lesion is most likely involved?","options":["AICA","PICA","MCA","ACA ## Page 25"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"AICA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A (AICA). The anterior inferior cerebellar artery supplies the lateral pons, including the facial nucleus, cochlear nuclei, and labyrinthine structures. Infarction of AICA typically presents with ipsilateral facial paralysis, decreased lacrimation and salivation, diminished taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, ipsilateral hearing loss or tinnitus due to involvement of the cochlear nuclei, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature from the body (Bassetti & Bogousslavsky, 1993; Kim, 2000). PICA infarcts (Option B) produce lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome without facial paralysis or hearing loss (Fisher, 1967). MCA (Option C) and ACA (Option D) infarcts involve cortical regions and do not produce the brainstem auditory and facial findings seen here.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding brainstem vascular territories is foundational to localizing stroke syndromes. The vertebrobasilar system gives rise to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) which typically arises from the proximal basilar artery and courses lateral to supply the dorsolateral pons. According to ICD-11, AICA infarction falls under 'I63.2 \u2013 cerebral infarction due to occlusion of vertebral artery or posterior inferior cerebellar artery', but more precisely is coded under basilar branch occlusion. Embryologically, the AICA originates from the basilar artery formed by the fusion of the bilateral longitudinal neural arteries. Neuroanatomically, the lateral pontine tegmentum contains the facial nerve fibers, vestibulocochlear nerve nuclei, and spinothalamic tracts. The cochlear nuclei receive afferent input from the cochlear nerve and project rostrally through the lateral lemniscus. The blood\u2013brain barrier in this region is maintained by tight junctions in pial vessels supplied by AICA. Genetically, no single mutation predisposes to AICA infarction, though atherosclerotic risk factors (e.g., LDL receptor mutations) contribute to vessel occlusion.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the AICA provides oxygenated blood to the lateral pons, including the facial nucleus and cochlear nuclei. Occlusion of AICA leads to ischemia and energy failure in these regions. At the molecular level, ATP depletion disrupts Na\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase activity, resulting in neuronal depolarization, Ca\u00b2\u207a influx, glutamate release, and excitotoxicity. Reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction further damage neuronal membranes. The inflammatory cascade involves microglial activation, release of cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), and breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier. Selective vulnerability of large projection neurons in the facial nucleus and the cochlear hair cells leads to facial paralysis and hearing loss, respectively. Spinothalamic tract injury causes contralateral analgesia and thermoanesthesia. Compared to PICA infarction, AICA infarcts uniquely involve the facial and cochlear nuclei due to their arterial distribution (Horn, 1993).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with AICA infarction present acutely, often within hours of vascular occlusion, with ipsilateral facial paralysis (House-Brackmann grade III\u2013VI in 60\u201380% of cases), ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss or tinnitus (50\u201370%), decreased lacrimation, salivation, and taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Contralateral body pain and temperature loss occurs in 80% of patients. Nystagmus and vertigo may be present due to vestibular nucleus involvement. The syndrome has two main variants: the classical lateral pontine (facial paralysis predominant) and the cerebellar variant (ataxia predominant). Without treatment, infarct volume expands over 24\u201372 hours with risk of brainstem edema. Prognosis varies by lesion size; small infarcts often recover facial function (50%\u201360% at 6 months), while larger lesions have persistent deficits (Saver, 2006).","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation involves noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity 60% for posterior fossa strokes). MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has sensitivity 95% and specificity 98% for acute brainstem infarction (Edlow & Newman-Toker, 2015). MRA or CTA identifies vessel occlusion; digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains gold standard (sensitivity 99%, specificity 100%). Audiometry confirms sensorineural hearing loss. A tiered approach: first-tier labs include CBC, electrolytes, glucose, coagulation; second-tier includes echocardiography and Holter monitoring for cardioembolism; third-tier includes hypercoagulability workup in young patients. Pretest probability of posterior circulation stroke in lateral pontine syndrome is >90% when facial paralysis coexists with hearing loss (Powers et al., 2019).","management_principles":"Acute ischemic stroke treatment follows AHA/ASA guidelines (Powers et al., 2019). Intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours (Class I, Level A) reduces disability (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.35\u20132.26). Mechanical thrombectomy is reserved for large vessel occlusion in basilar or vertebral arteries within 6\u201324 hours (Class I, Level A). Blood pressure management targets <185/110 mmHg pre-thrombolysis. Neuroprotective strategies (normoglycemia, normothermia) are applied. Secondary prevention includes high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 80\u2009mg daily; NNT 20 for recurrent stroke prevention), antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81\u2009mg daily; NNT 43), blood pressure control (ACE inhibitors), and lifestyle modification. Facial paralysis rehabilitation involves physical therapy and electrical stimulation. Hearing rehabilitation includes auditory brainstem implants in severe cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should undergo MRI/MRA at 24\u201348 hours post-stroke to assess infarct evolution. Neurologic exams are repeated daily during hospitalization, then at 1, 3, and 6 months. Audiometry is repeated at 1 month and 6 months to monitor recovery. Carotid duplex and cardiac monitoring at 1 month to detect progression or new embolic sources. Long\u2010term management includes LDL monitoring every 6 months, blood pressure checks monthly until stable, and diabetes control. Secondary prevention targets: LDL <70\u2009mg/dL, BP <130/80\u2009mmHg, HbA1c <7%. Depression screening at 3 months is recommended. Rehabilitation programs are tailored with quarterly functional assessments (mRS, BI).","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the next best step in management?","options":["MRI brain","CTA neck"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"CTA neck","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: CTA neck. In a patient with transient ischemic attack (TIA) manifesting as monocular visual loss (amaurosis fugax) and dysarthria, the immediate priority is to identify high-risk vascular pathology. According to the 2018 AHA/ASA TIA guidelines (Class I, Level of Evidence B\u2013R), patients with symptomatic TIA should undergo urgent vascular imaging of the head and neck to evaluate for stenosis or occlusion that would alter acute management and consideration of revascularization. CTA of the neck (and head) provides rapid, noninvasive assessment of extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries with reported sensitivity of ~94% and specificity of ~92% for detecting \u226550% stenosis (Powers et al. 2018). Option A (MRI brain) is indicated within 24 hours to detect diffusion\u2010positive lesions but does not immediately assess the causative vascular lesion guiding urgent intervention; it is lower priority in the hyperacute phase compared to vascular imaging. MRI may also be less available emergently and has contraindications. Therefore, CTA neck is the next best step.","conceptual_foundation":"Transient ischemic attack is defined as transient focal neurological dysfunction without evidence of acute infarction on imaging, lasting less than 24 hours (Easton et al. 2009). Amaurosis fugax arises from transient ischemia of the ipsilateral retina, most commonly due to cholesterol embolism from an ulcerated ipsilateral carotid plaque. Dysarthria in this context suggests involvement of the internal carotid\u2013MCA territory or hemodynamic compromise. Major risk factors include hypertension, smoking, and large-artery atherosclerosis. Differential diagnoses include ocular migraine, giant cell arteritis, and ophthalmic pathology; however, co-occurrence of cortical (dysarthria) and retinal symptoms highly localizes to carotid territory TIA. Nosologically, TIA is classified under ICD-11 8A80.0, and the underlying pathology fits within large-artery atherosclerosis in the TOAST classification. Early vascular imaging is crucial to stratify risk and guide intervention.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, retinal and cerebral perfusion is maintained by intact carotid arteries supplying the ophthalmic and cerebral branches. Atherosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid bifurcation involves endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation, and chronic inflammation with macrophage infiltration and smooth muscle proliferation. Plaque ulceration can liberate cholesterol microemboli that travel via the ophthalmic artery to occlude retinal arterioles, causing transient monocular blindness. Hemodynamic stenosis reduces distal perfusion, leading to transient cortical ischemic symptoms such as dysarthria. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and MMPs degrade extracellular matrix, increasing plaque vulnerability. Acute embolic and hemodynamic mechanisms combine to produce transient focal deficits characteristic of TIA.","clinical_manifestation":"TIA typically presents suddenly, with focal deficits resolving within minutes to hours. Amaurosis fugax is described as a descending 'curtain' or 'shade' over the visual field, lasting seconds to minutes, and is painless. Dysarthria presents as slurred speech without other cranial nerve or motor deficits in isolated cases. In large-artery TIA, symptoms often recur or evolve over hours if untreated. Approximately 9\u201310% of patients with TIA will suffer a stroke within 90 days, half occurring within 48 hours (Lavallee et al. 2016). High-risk features include symptom duration >10 minutes, motor weakness, and multiple TIAs in 7 days.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage (sensitivity ~95% for acute blood). Simultaneous CTA head and neck is recommended emergently for patients with high-risk TIA (Class I, Level B\u2013NR) to detect stenosis \u226550%. Carotid duplex ultrasound is an alternative if CTA contraindicated (sensitivity 88%, specificity 95%). Second-tier: MRI with DWI within 24 hours to detect acute ischemia (sensitivity >90%, specificity ~100%). ECG and cardiac monitoring for atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography if cardioembolic source suspected. Third-tier: Transcranial Doppler bubble study for PFO, hypercoagulable workup in young patients.","management_principles":"Initial management includes dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin 81 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg for 21 days, as demonstrated by the CHANCE trial (HR for stroke 0.68; 95% CI 0.57\u20130.81; Wang et al. 2013). High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg) irrespective of baseline LDL is recommended (Class I, Level of Evidence A). Blood pressure control to <130/80 mmHg (SPRINT trial data). Lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation. For symptomatic carotid stenosis \u226570%, carotid endarterectomy within 14 days reduces 5-year ipsilateral stroke risk from 26% to 9% (NASCET; NNT=6). Stenosis 50\u201369% yields more modest benefit (NNT=15).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be seen in a TIA clinic or stroke prevention service within 24\u201348 hours. Repeat vascular imaging if intervention not performed within two weeks. Monitor for recurrent TIA or stroke symptoms. Long-term follow-up includes LDL checks every 3\u20136 months, blood pressure monitoring monthly until stable, and periodic duplex ultrasound if carotid disease managed conservatively. For patients post-CEA, duplex at 1 month, 6 months, then annually.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Symptomatic carotid stenosis \u226570% benefits from CEA with NNT=6 over 5 years. 5. Noncontrast CT alone cannot detect acute infarcts; MRI DWI is more sensitive but not a substitute for emergent vascular imaging.","references":"1. Easton JD, Saver JL, Albers GW, et al.
