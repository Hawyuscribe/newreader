[{"question_number":"1","question":"This is a 24-year-old female patient with a known case of aneurysm, presenting with a history of right-sided headache and right pupil dilatation. On examination, the right pupil is dilated, with impaired right eye adduction. A computed tomography (CT) brain scan showed a ruptured aneurysm. Where is the location of the aneurysm?","options":["Right PCOM","Right ICR","Right ACOM","Right MCA"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Right PCOM","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct. Compression of the oculomotor nerve by a posterior communicating artery aneurysm classically produces an ipsilateral third nerve palsy with pupillary dilation due to preferential involvement of the peripheral parasympathetic fibers (Fisher CM. Stroke 1975;6(1):53-60). In contrast, aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery (Option C) or middle cerebral artery (Option D) rarely produce isolated third nerve palsy with pupillary involvement. The internal carotid artery at the carotid\u2013ophthalmic segment (Option B) can produce oculomotor dysfunction but the most common location for a compressive aneurysm leading to isolated oculomotor palsy is the PCOM. Meta-analysis data indicate that PCOM aneurysms account for approximately 20\u201325% of all intracranial aneurysms and are responsible for over 50% of aneurysm\u2013induced third nerve palsies (Rinkel GJ, et al. Stroke 1998;29(5):882-8). Sensitivity of CT angiography for PCOM aneurysms >3 mm is >95% (AHA/ASA Guidelines 2015).","conceptual_foundation":"The oculomotor nerve (CN III) arises from the ventral midbrain, traverses the interpeduncular cistern, passes between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries, and enters the cavernous sinus before splitting into superior and inferior divisions within the orbit. In the subarachnoid space, the superficial parasympathetic fibers lie dorsally and are vulnerable to compression. PCOM aneurysms occur at the junction of the internal carotid and the posterior communicating artery, adjacent to the oculomotor nerve. Within the WHO ICD-11 classification, cerebral aneurysm is coded under QA93.3; subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured aneurysm is UC61.Z. Historical classification evolved from early autopsy series by Dandy (1930s) to modern angiographic criteria.","pathophysiology":"Normal cranial nerve III physiology includes somatic motor fibers controlling extraocular muscles (superior, medial, inferior recti; inferior oblique) and visceral parasympathetic fibers controlling pupillary constriction. A saccular (berry) aneurysm at the PCOM exerts mass effect on the peripheral parasympathetic fibers first, producing early pupillary dilation, then compresses the central motor fibers leading to ptosis and impaired extraocular movements. Rupture into the subarachnoid space causes sudden headache and risk of rebleeding. Cellular injury from hemorrhage induces inflammatory cascades, free radical generation, and vasospasm (peak 7\u201310 days post\u2013SAH).","clinical_manifestation":"Ruptured PCOM aneurysms commonly present with thunderclap headache (>90%), nuchal rigidity (70\u201380%), and isolated third nerve palsy with dilated pupil (15\u201320%). Nonruptured PCOM aneurysms may present chronically with diplopia or pupil dilation. Other manifestations include altered consciousness (GCS <8 in 40% at presentation) and seizures (10%). Natural history without treatment carries a 30% rebleed risk within the first year and 50% mortality at first rebleed.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Noncontrast CT head within 6 hours of headache onset\u2014sensitivity >98% for SAH. If negative and suspicion remains high, perform CT angiography (sensitivity 95%, specificity 99% for aneurysms >3 mm). If CTA inconclusive, digital subtraction angiography remains gold standard (sensitivity ~100%). Pretest probability stratified by Hunt-Hess grade and Fisher scale guides urgency. Lumbar puncture indicated if CT negative after 6 hours; xanthochromia detection by spectrophotometry has sensitivity 100% and specificity 96%.","management_principles":"Secure the aneurysm within 72 hours via endovascular coiling (ISAT trial: 10\u2010year rebleed rate 3%; relative risk reduction 23% vs. clipping) or microsurgical clipping. Nimodipine 60 mg orally every 4 hours for 21 days reduces delayed cerebral ischemia (Class I, Level A). Maintain euvolemia and normotension. Manage intracranial pressure with head elevation, hyperosmolar therapy. Prophylactic anticonvulsants not routinely recommended (AHA/ASA 2012).","follow_up_guidelines":"Obtain follow-up vascular imaging (CTA/MRA) at 6 months and annually for 3 years to monitor for recurrence. Perform transcranial Doppler daily between days 3\u201314 to detect vasospasm (mean flow velocity >120 cm/s). Neurological assessments every 2 hours in first 24 hours, then every 4 hours. Monitor electrolytes and renal function while on nimodipine. Rehabilitation consultation prior to discharge for cranial nerve palsy rehabilitation and ocular motility exercises.","clinical_pearls":"1. PCOM aneurysm compression causes isolated third nerve palsy with pupillary dilation\u2014classic sign. 2. Early CT (<6 hrs) nearly excludes SAH; beyond that, LP is required. 3.

However, the patient\u2019s severe dysarthria, facial weakness, and dense hemiparesis correspond to an NIHSS >10 (mean 15), indicating a high-deficit stroke (Freedom Registry, 2019). Thus \u201clow deficit\u201d is incorrect: severe presentations demand urgent reperfusion rather than exclusion. Scenarios where low deficits might be considered include isolated sensory symptoms or mild facial droop; even then, local guidelines recommend individualized risk\u2013benefit assessment (AHA/ASA 2019).\nOption B: Out of tPA window\nThe accepted intravenous alteplase window is 4.5 hours from symptom onset, with greatest efficacy before 3 hours (relative risk reduction ~30%) and acceptable risk up to 4.5 hours (NINDS 1995; ECASS III 2008). At 3.5 hours, the patient remains within the guideline-defined window. Therefore, this is not a violation, provided other criteria are met. Extended windows require advanced imaging for penumbral salvage and are protocolled in comprehensive centers (DEFUSE 3, 2018).\nOption C: Platelet count of 45,000 (Correct)\nPer AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines, a platelet count <100,000/mm3 is an absolute contraindication to IV tPA due to high hemorrhagic transformation rates (~15% vs 6% normal; SITS-MOST registry). Thrombocytopenia impairs primary hemostasis; low platelet plug formation allows unchecked fibrinolysis and vessel leak. This patient\u2019s 45,000/mm3 reading violates protocol and directly predisposed to intracranial hemorrhage. Misconceptions include believing only coagulopathy (INR) matters; in fact, platelet thresholds are equally critical (AHA/ASA 2018).\nOption D: Unknown risk factor\nAn unspecified option cannot override documented thrombolysis exclusion criteria. Commonly mistaken factors include controlled hypertension (BP <185/110 mm Hg is acceptable) or isolated dysphasia. Without clear evidence, D cannot be the protocol violation. Only thrombocytopenia definitively breaches stroke thrombolysis guidelines.","conceptual_foundation":"The key anatomical structures implicated in acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction include the precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex), internal capsule (posterior limb corticospinal tracts), and facial nucleus in the pons. The corticobulbar fibers controlling facial and bulbar muscles traverse the genu of the internal capsule, explaining concurrent dysarthria and facial weakness. Embryologically, the neural tube gives rise to brain vesicles by week 4; disruption in vascular supply or genetic guidance (e.g., HOX genes) can predispose to malformations predisposing to stroke. Under normal physiology, neurons rely on uninterrupted cerebral blood flow (CBF) of ~50 mL/100g/min; autoregulation via arteriolar smooth muscle and astrocytic endfeet maintains perfusion between mean arterial pressures of 60\u2013150 mm Hg.\nRelated conditions include lacunar stroke (small vessel lipohyalinosis), watershed infarcts, and intracerebral hemorrhage in basal ganglia. Seminal historical perspectives trace back to Wepfer (1658) describing stroke pathology, and later Fisher\u2019s work on lacunes (1965). Landmark anatomical landmarks: sylvian fissure (MCA branches), lenticulostriate vessels (internal capsule supply), and corona radiata fibers that coordinate motor planning. Recognizing these structures is critical for correlating clinical syndromes and imaging findings.","pathophysiology":"tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) acts by converting plasminogen to plasmin via Arg560-Ile561 cleavage, initiating fibrin clot lysis. In the presence of thrombocytopenia, decreased platelet count (<100,000/mm3) impairs the primary hemostatic plug formation through reduced GpIIb/IIIa receptor\u2013mediated aggregation. This imbalance leads to unopposed plasmin activity and vessel wall degradation via matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9), increasing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability and hemorrhagic transformation risk.\nAt the cellular level, ischemia triggers excitotoxicity: excessive glutamate release via NMDA receptors causes Ca2+ overload, activating calpains and reactive oxygen species, leading to apoptosis. Genetic predispositions (e.g., MTHFR C677T mutation) can exacerbate homocysteine accumulation, promoting endothelial dysfunction. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) upregulate adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) and microglial activation, further injuring penumbral tissue. Energy failure from ATP depletion disrupts Na+/K+ ATPase, causing cytotoxic edema within minutes; vasogenic edema follows in 24\u201372 hours. Compensatory collateral recruitment via leptomeningeal anastomoses can preserve penumbral flow but is often insufficient in proximal MCA occlusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in acute ischemic stroke is typically abrupt, reaching maximum severity within minutes. This patient\u2019s timeline: 0\u20131 hour, sudden left-sided flaccid paralysis; 1\u20132 hours, severe dysarthria and facial droop; 3.5 hours, ER arrival for tPA evaluation. Neurological examination reveals contralateral upper motor neuron signs: hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, spasticity later in evolution. Dysarthria arises from corticobulbar tract involvement; facial weakness is central (forehead-sparing in upper facial innervation).\nIn pediatric strokes, presentations may be more subtle (seizures); elderly patients often have comorbid dementia complicating recognition. Gender differences are minimal for focal deficits but females report more nontraditional symptoms (e.g., hiccups). Systemic manifestations include hyperglycemia and hypertension (present in 70% of cases). Severity scales: NIHSS score of 15 predicts 30% 3-month mortality. Red flags such as severe headache or vomiting suggest hemorrhagic transformation. Without treatment, large MCA infarcts progress to malignant edema in 2\u20135 days with 80% mortality.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

What will you order in this case?","options":["NOTCH 3","Echo","APLs"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"NOTCH 3","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (NOTCH3 genetic testing): This is the correct choice in a 40-year-old with lacunar strokes, migraine, cognitive decline, and a family history of early cerebrovascular death. CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) results from NOTCH3 mutations in 100% of definitive cases (Joutel et al. 1996). Sensitivity of genetic testing is >98% and specificity >99% (Chabriat et al. 2018). Common misconceptions include ordering MRI alone or vascular panels without gene sequencing. Option B (echocardiogram): An echo is indicated in cryptogenic stroke with cardiac risk factors. In embolic presentations like atrial fibrillation or cardiac mural thrombus, echo sensitivity is 60\u201380% (AHA/ASA 2021). Our patient\u2019s lacunar pattern and migraine history make cardioembolism unlikely. Option C (antiphospholipid antibodies): APL syndrome causes large-vessel and venous thromboses, miscarriages, thrombocytopenia. Tests have false positive rate ~5% (fulfills lupus anticoagulant criteria) (ISTH 2015). This patient lacks systemic features of APS. No option D present. Thus NOTCH3 testing is definitive for CADASIL in this phenotype, confirming diagnosis, guiding family screening, and avoiding unwarranted anticoagulation.","conceptual_foundation":"CADASIL involves small penetrating arterioles in deep white matter, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem. NOTCH3 is expressed on vascular smooth muscle cell membranes in these regions. Embryologically, NOTCH pathways guide arterial differentiation from neural crest\u2013derived mesenchyme during weeks 4\u20138 of gestation. In adulthood, the NOTCH3 receptor regulates smooth muscle cell viability and intercellular signaling via the RBPJ\u03ba transcriptional pathway. Pathological granular osmiophilic material deposits accumulate in vessel walls, leading to progressive leukoencephalopathy. Historically described by Van Bogaert in 1955, the molecular etiology was elucidated by Joutel et al. in 1996. Neuroanatomical landmarks of interest include the periventricular white matter tracts, the corona radiata, external capsule, temporal lobes, and anterior temporal poles, which exhibit T2 hyperintensities on MRI. Clinically, CADASIL overlaps with other hereditary small-vessel diseases but is distinguished by migraine with aura, subcortical infarcts, psychiatric symptoms, and progressive cognitive decline. Understanding the interplay between vascular anatomy, embryological signaling, and receptor function underpins accurate diagnosis and management.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, CADASIL results from heterozygous missense mutations in NOTCH3, typically affecting conserved cysteine residues in epidermal growth factor\u2013like repeats (EGFR) domains 1\u201334. These mutations alter disulfide bonding, leading to abnormal receptor folding and accumulation of granular osmiophilic material in arteriolar media. Dysregulated NOTCH3 signaling disrupts vascular smooth muscle cell survival via impaired activation of the RBPJ\u03ba\u2013MAML transcription complex and downstream targets such as HES and HEY genes. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinases contribute to blood\u2013brain barrier dysfunction and demyelination. Oxidative stress via NADPH oxidase pathways exacerbates endothelial injury. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with near 100% penetrance by age 60. Pathological changes progress over decades: early vessel changes appear in the third decade, radiological white-matter hyperintensities by age 35\u201340, and clinical strokes typically onset by age 45\u201350. Compensatory collateral remodeling is limited in deep perforators, leading to cumulative ischemic injury. Energy failure in oligodendrocytes and axons drives progressive cognitive impairment, while astrocyte gliosis amplifies tissue damage.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in CADASIL typically begins in the third to fourth decade. Migraine with aura occurs in ~30\u201340% of carriers by age 35. Ischemic events manifest as transient ischemic attacks or lacunar strokes in 60\u201370% by age 45. Dysarthria, pure motor hemiparesis, or mixed sensorimotor syndromes can peak within minutes to hours. Cognitive decline begins with executive dysfunction, attention deficits, and processing speed impairment, progressing to subcortical dementia by age 55\u201360 in 50% of patients. Neurological exam reveals hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, mild ataxia, and depressed vibration sense in lower limbs. Pediatric presentations are rare but include early migraines. No clear gender predilection exists. Systemic features are generally absent, though psychiatric disturbances (depression, apathy) affect 30\u201350%. Severity grading uses the CADASIL scale (0\u20137), correlating with modified Rankin Score. Red flags include early cognitive decline and autosomal dominant history. Without treatment, mean survival from first stroke is 18 years. Late-stage disease presents with gait disturbance, spasticity, and urinary incontinence due to diffuse subcortical pathology.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Obtain MRI with FLAIR and T2 sequences to assess white-matter hyperintensities in anterior temporal poles and external capsule, per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: Perform targeted NOTCH3 gene sequencing if MRI pattern is characteristic, sensitivity >98% (per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines). Step 3: Exclude alternative small-vessel etiologies via ESR, ANA, ANCA, and antiphospholipid antibodies (per International Stroke Genetics Consortium 2022). Step 4: Consider skin or muscle biopsy demonstrating granular osmiophilic material when genetic testing is inconclusive (per European Stroke Organization 2020 consensus). Step 5: Cardiac evaluation (echo) only if embolic pattern or risk factors exist (per AHA/ASA 2021). Step 6: Neuropsychological testing for executive and memory deficits, employing MoCA with cutoff <26 (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Each step is aimed at maximizing diagnostic yield while minimizing unnecessary tests, ensuring early family screening and genetic counseling.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Control vascular risk factors aggressively.

This patient\u2019s ABCD2 score is 7 (Age >60 = 1; BP >140/90 = 1; Clinical focal weakness = 2; Duration 10\u201359 minutes = 2; Diabetes = 1), conferring a 90-day stroke risk of \u224812\u201318% (Johnston et al., 2007). Option A (Low risk 3%) corresponds to ABCD2 \u22643 at 90 days; Option B (Moderate risk 10%) underestimates the high risk; Option D is a duplicate of C. A common error is confusing 7-day risk (~8%) with 90-day risk.","conceptual_foundation":"The ABCD2 score stratifies TIA patients into risk categories using Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration, and Diabetes. It evolved from the original ABCD score to include diabetes and improve predictive validity. In ICD-11, TIA is coded as 8A01.Z. Differential prognosis factors include large artery atherosclerosis vs. small-vessel disease, presence of carotid stenosis, and atrial fibrillation. Historical validation studies established its use across diverse populations.","pathophysiology":"TIA results from transient cerebral ischemia without infarction, often due to thromboembolism, plaque instability, or perforator occlusion. Focal weakness reflects motor cortex or internal capsule ischemia. Transient disruption of neuronal energy metabolism leads to ion pump failure and temporary conduction block. Rapid reperfusion via collateral flow or clot lysis restores function but leaves unstable vascular pathology predisposing to subsequent stroke.","clinical_manifestation":"Typically sudden onset focal neurologic deficits (e.g., unilateral weakness) resolving within 24 hours. Prodromal symptoms may include transient visual changes or paresthesias. ABCD2-derived risk correlates with severity and duration of initial symptoms; higher scores predict persistent vascular instability. Subpopulations (elderly, diabetic) have worse outcomes.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Urgent brain MRI with DWI to rule out infarction; vascular imaging of head/neck (CTA/MRA) to identify high-grade stenosis; ECG and echocardiography for cardioembolic sources. Second-tier: Holter monitoring, hypercoagulability workup. Pretest probability of stroke high with ABCD2 \u22656; timely evaluation within 24 hours reduces 90-day stroke risk by >50%.","management_principles":"Immediate antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days (CHANCE trial: NNT \u2248 50 for stroke prevention; HR 0.68). Statin therapy (target LDL <70 mg/dL) and aggressive BP control (goal <130/80 mmHg). Consider carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis >50% within 2 weeks. Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation per CHA2DS2-VASc score.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurology follow-up within 1 week post-TIA; vascular surgery evaluation if carotid disease; BP and lipid monitoring every 3 months; repeat imaging if new symptoms. Educate patient on TIA warning signs and medication adherence.","clinical_pearls":"1. ABCD2 \u22656 predicts high 90-day stroke risk (~18%); act urgently. 2. Differentiate TIA from TIA mimics (seizure, migraine) to avoid misclassification. 3. Dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days lowers recurrent stroke risk with minimal bleeding increase. 4. Carotid imaging within 24 hours can identify surgical candidates. 5. Blood pressure management post-TIA reduces recurrent stroke risk by >30%.","references":"6. Johnston SC, et al.

On examination, she has mouth ulcers. What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Migraine","Intracranial hemorrhage","Multiple sclerosis","?? ## Page 4"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A migraine is unlikely because chronic unilateral weakness and prolonged intracranial pressure symptoms are not typical. Migraine headaches last four to seventy two hours and respond to triptans. While aura can cause transient weakness in five percent of patients, persistent focal deficits over days are not consistent with migraine.\nOption B intracranial hemorrhage was considered given headache and focal deficits. Acute bleeding typically presents with abrupt onset to maximal headache in under one minute and deteriorates rapidly. Four day progression and a one month history of nausea and vomiting without acute neurologic collapse make hemorrhage improbable in this scenario.\nOption C multiple sclerosis can cause relapsing focal deficits and headache rarely. Typical MS presents in women around thirty with optic neuritis sensory symptoms or internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Mouth ulcers and vomiting are not features and steroid responsive episodes last days to weeks with MRI lesions. Clinical picture does not match MS.\nOption D none of the above is correct diagnosis because patient history of mouth ulcers headache vomiting and focal weakness over days suggests neuroinflammatory vasculopathy such as Neuro Behcet disease rather than common migraine hemorrhage or multiple sclerosis. Pathophysiology involves venous sinus thrombosis induced by systemic immune mediated endothelial injury.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomical structures involved include dural venous sinuses such as superior sagittal transverse and sigmoid sinuses that drain cortical and deep cerebral veins. The basal ganglia thalami brainstem and cortical areas maintain blood barrier integrity via tight junctions formed during embryological development of the neural crest and mesodermal contributions to meninges. Embryogenesis of cerebral vasculature includes formation of primitive capillary plexus and differentiation into pial vessels regulated by VEGF and Notch pathways. Normal physiology of intracranial pressure homeostasis relies on CSF production at 0.3 milliliters per minute in choroid plexus and absorption via arachnoid granulations. The glymphatic system contributes clearance of metabolic byproducts in interstitial fluid during sleep. Related neurological syndromes include cerebral venous sinus thrombosis from hypercoagulable states Behcet disease with mucocutaneous ulcers and central venous involvement and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Historically Thomas Willis described circle of Willis in the seventeenth century while later Virchow and Lobstein delineated venous inflammatory changes. Key landmarks include torcula Herophili at confluence of sinuses Labbes vein connections and bridging cortical veins between pia and dura. These structures are clinically significant for thrombosis risk and intracranial pressure regulation. In addition structural relationship of the cavernous sinus to cranial nerves three four V one V two and six explains ocular motor involvement in nearby thrombosis. The lamina terminalis and foramen of Monro are critical shunt sites. Anterior and posterior intercavernous sinuses connect lateral dural compartments. Microscopic dural trabeculae support venous channels and maintain patency under dynamic pressure conditions.","pathophysiology":"Neuro Behcet related cerebral venous sinus thrombosis arises from autoimmune mediated endothelial injury driven by Th1 Th17 lymphocytes. Tumor necrosis factor alpha interleukin six and interleukin one beta are elevated in serum and cerebrospinal fluid and trigger upregulation of adhesion molecules VCAM one and ICAM one on vascular endothelium. HLA B51 positivity confers a twofold increased risk via antigen presentation and molecular mimicry. Immune complexes activate complement cascade C three C five leading to membrane attack complex insertion in vascular walls. Neutrophil hyperactivation and NETosis exacerbate thrombosis. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase dysregulation reduces vasodilatory nitric oxide promoting vasoconstriction. Procoagulant tissue factor expression amplifies thrombin generation. Platelet activation releases serotonin and ADP furthering aggregation in microvessels. Reactive oxygen species accumulate causing lipid peroxidation and blood brain barrier disruption. Genetic polymorphisms in TNF promoter and IL ten gene cluster modulate inflammatory response intensity. Compensatory collateral vessel formation occurs over weeks but is inadequate to restore normal flow. Persistent occlusion leads to venous congestion cytotoxic edema and hemorrhagic infarction if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically develop headache gradually over days with progressive severity reaching peak intensity on day four to day seven after symptom onset. Associated nausea vomiting and photophobia may mimic increased intracranial pressure. Neurological examination reveals focal deficits including unilateral hemiparesis sensory loss or aphasia depending on cortical region involved. Papilledema is seen in up to sixty percent of venous sinus thrombosis cases. Seizures occur in twenty to forty percent. Mouth ulcers appear in thirty to eight percent of Neuro Behcet cases often preceding neurological signs by weeks. Younger adults exhibit more aggressive course compared to older patients who may have subtler symptoms. Female to male ratio in Neuro Behcet ranges from one to one to three to one. Systemic features include genital ulcers and uveitis. Severity can be graded by modified Rankin Scale from zero to six. Red flags include acute focal deterioration visual changes and altered consciousness. Natural history without treatment entails persistent deficits potential hemorrhage and mortality rates of ten to fifteen percent in one year.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation begins with noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage with sensitivity around sixty percent for venous infarction. If CT is negative but suspicion remains order MR venography using contrast enhanced T one gradient echo and time of flight sequences which have over ninety percent sensitivity and specificity for sinus occlusion. Lumbar puncture shows elevated opening pressure above twenty five cm H2O with lymphocytic pleocytosis two to two hundred cells per microliter protein elevation up to two hundred mg per deciliter and normal glucose. D dimer may be elevated above five hundred ng per milliliter however normal levels do not exclude diagnosis. Second line tests include digital subtraction angiography reserved when MRI inconclusive. Laboratory workup screens for hypercoagulable states including antiphospholipid antibodies protein C S and antithrombin levels. Autoimmune panels evaluate ANCA ANA and HLA B51. Electroencephalography can detect focal slowing or seizures. Differential considers meningitis stroke and idiopathic intracranial hypertension which can be distinguished by imaging vascular flow patterns and CSF analysis.","management_principles":"First line therapy for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in Neuro Behcet includes low molecular weight heparin at one mg per kilogram subcutaneously every twelve hours transitioning to oral warfarin to maintain INR between two and three. Concurrent high dose corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone one gram intravenous daily for three to five days followed by prednisone one mg per kilogram daily tapered over six weeks reduces inflammatory activity. Second line agents include cyclophosphamide at fifteen mg per kilogram monthly pulses or azathioprine two to 2.5 mg per kilogram daily for maintenance. Anti TNF biologics such as infliximab at five mg per kilogram at weeks zero two six and every eight weeks thereafter are indicated in refractory cases with ocular or neurological involvement. Monitor complete blood count liver function and INR twice weekly during acute phase. Contraindicated agents include high dose aspirin without anticoagulation due to hemorrhage risk. Endovascular thrombolysis with urokinase may be considered if deterioration occurs under anticoagulation with success rates around seventy percent. Supportive measures include seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam five hundred mg twice daily and elevated head positioning.","follow_up_guidelines":"After initial discharge follow up visits occur at two weeks six weeks three months six months and twelve months. Clinical monitoring parameters include neurological exam strength cranial nerve function and vision assessments targeting full recovery of deficits. Laboratory surveillance checks INR every two weeks during warfarin adjustment then monthly once stable. MRI with MR venography is repeated at three and twelve months to confirm recanalization. Long term complications include persistent headaches in twenty percent and epilepsy in ten percent. Prognosis at one year shows seventy to eighty percent functional independence and five year survival above ninety percent. Rehabilitation needs include physical occupational and speech therapy initiated within two weeks and continued for three to six months. Educate patients on medication adherence risk factors and recurrence prevention. Return to work driving is permitted after clinical stabilization typically three to six months. Support resources include national vasculitis foundations and patient advocacy groups.","clinical_pearls":"Behcet disease often presents with recurrent oral aphthae before systemic manifestations. Recall HLA B51 association and positive pathergy test in thirty percent. Neuro Behcet can mimic idiopathic intracranial hypertension but requires vessel imaging. D dimer has limited negative predictive value in isolated venous thrombosis. Early anticoagulation reduces mortality by roughly fifty percent. High dose steroids control inflammation but require gradual taper. Consider anti TNF agents if cyclophosphamide contraindicated. Remember cerebral venous thrombosis accounts for ten to fifteen percent of Neuro Behcet neurological involvement. Monitor for steroid induced hyperglycemia and osteoporosis. MRI venography is gold standard for sinus occlusion detection.","references":"1. International Study Group for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease. Criteria for diagnosis. Lancet 1990;335:1078-1080.
