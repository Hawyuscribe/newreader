What is the next step in management?","options":["MRI","CTA","Conventional angiography","Observation"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"CTA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most appropriate next step is CTA (computed tomography angiography). In a patient with a large lobar intracerebral hemorrhage on noncontrast CT, CTA provides rapid, noninvasive evaluation for underlying vascular lesions (e.g., aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation) that may have precipitated the bleed (Steiner et al. 2014). CTA has sensitivity of ~90\u201395% and specificity of ~85\u201390% for detecting vascular malformations compared to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (M\u00fcller et al. 2016). MRI (Option A) is less sensitive in the acute hemorrhagic setting due to susceptibility artifacts and longer acquisition times. Conventional angiography (Option C) remains the gold standard but is invasive and reserved for cases with negative or equivocal CTA when high suspicion persists. Observation alone (Option D) risks missing a surgically treatable lesion and is not guideline-recommended without vascular imaging (Hemphill et al. 2015).","conceptual_foundation":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 10\u201315% of strokes and is classified by location: lobar (cortical/subcortical), deep (basal ganglia, thalamus), brainstem, or cerebellar. Lobar hemorrhages in older adults raise concern for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) or structural vascular lesions. According to ICD-11, spontaneous ICH falls under 8A40. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic infarct, hemorrhagic neoplasm, and vascular malformations. CAA-related lobar bleeds often recur and predispose to microbleeds visible on gradient-echo MRI, whereas vascular malformations (AVMs, aneurysms) may present at any age. Embryologically, AVMs result from failure of capillary plexus formation. CTA maps arterial anatomy by imaging iodinated contrast passage through cerebral vessels, delineating nidus or aneurysmal sacs. Noncontrast CT detects acute blood by high attenuation; CTA builds on that by adding angiographic detail.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral vasculature consists of a continuous capillary network with tight junctions maintaining the blood\u2013brain barrier. In AVMs, direct arteriovenous shunting disrupts microcirculation, creating high\u2010flow channels prone to rupture. Aneurysms arise from focal weakness in the arterial wall\u2019s internal elastic lamina, often at bifurcations. When either structure ruptures, extravasation of blood into the cortical parenchyma increases intracranial pressure, causes local mass effect, and can induce secondary ischemia. CTA capitalizes on the hemodynamic contrast between intravascular and extravascular compartments to identify vascular shunts or outpouchings.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with lobar ICH typically present with acute headache, nausea, vomiting, focal neurological deficits (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia), and decreased level of consciousness. Lobar location often produces cortical signs: hemianopia, neglect, or aphasia if dominant hemisphere is involved. In contrast, deep ICH yields contralateral pure motor or sensory strokes. Risk factors include hypertension, CAA, and anticoagulation. The natural history without identification of underlying lesions may involve rebleeding rates of 5\u201310% in the first month.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010line imaging for suspected ICH is noncontrast head CT. Once hemorrhage is confirmed, CTA of head and neck is recommended (Class I, Level of Evidence B; AHA/ASA 2015) to screen for structural vascular lesions. If CTA is negative but suspicion remains high (e.g., lobar location in a younger patient, unusual shape), DSA is indicated (Class IIa, Level C). MRI/MRA can complement but are not primary in the acute phase. Coagulation profile, platelet count, and blood pressure should be assessed immediately to guide management.","management_principles":"Initial management of lobar ICH includes blood pressure control (target systolic BP <140 mm Hg; INTERACT2 trial), reversal of anticoagulation if present, and intracranial pressure management. If CTA reveals an aneurysm or AVM amenable to endovascular or surgical intervention, prompt neurosurgical consultation is indicated. Observation without vascular imaging risks missing treatable lesions. MRI is reserved for subacute evaluation of CAA (gradient-echo sequences for microbleeds) or neoplasm suspicion.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute stabilization and vascular imaging, patients with negative CTA but high suspicion should undergo catheter angiography within 1\u20132 weeks. For confirmed AVMs or aneurysms, follow-up imaging intervals depend on treatment modality: post-embolization angiography at 6 months, then yearly for 2\u20133 years. In CAA, follow-up MRI for microbleeds every 6\u201312 months guides recurrence risk. Blood pressure should be monitored daily during hospitalization and regularly outpatient.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always perform CTA after noncontrast CT in lobar ICH to exclude treatable vascular lesions.\n2. MRI in acute ICH is limited by susceptibility artifact\u2014use for subacute characterization of CAA or tumor.\n3. Negative CTA with high clinical suspicion mandates conventional angiography.\n4. Early blood pressure control (<140 mm Hg) reduces hematoma expansion (INTERACT2).\n5.

A brain computed tomography (CT) shows right frontal cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). What is the likely cause?","options":["Hyperperfusion","Rupture of undiagnosed aneurysm","Post-operative hematoma","Venous sinus thrombosis ## Page 3"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Hyperperfusion","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Hyperperfusion): This is the correct cause. After carotid endarterectomy (CEA), impaired cerebral autoregulation in chronically hypoperfused cortex can lead to hyperperfusion injury, disrupting the blood\u2013brain barrier and causing cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Symptomatic hyperperfusion syndrome occurs in 0.2\u20133% of CEA cases (Smith et al. 2019). Risk factors include preoperative stenosis >90%, contralateral occlusion, and postoperative systolic blood pressure >160 mm Hg. The hemorrhage pattern is typically cortical SAH, often within 24\u201348 h post-op. Option B (Rupture of undiagnosed aneurysm): Although 2\u20133% of adults harbor intracranial aneurysms, perioperative aneurysm rupture is exceedingly rare (<0.1%) and tends to produce diffuse basal SAH, not isolated cortical collections. A sentinel headache weeks earlier or subarachnoid xanthochromia on lumbar puncture would be expected. Option C (Post-operative hematoma): Post-CEA hemorrhage usually manifests as a neck hematoma compressing airway or intracerebral hematoma within basal ganglia if coagulopathic. SAH in the frontal sulci is not typical. Option D (Venous sinus thrombosis): Cerebral venous thrombosis may cause venous infarcts and parenchymal hemorrhages preferentially in parasagittal regions, but pure cortical SAH without venous occlusion signs on MRV is unlikely. Misconceptions often arise from conflating intracerebral with subarachnoid bleeding or overlooking autoregulation failure. Numerous case series (e.g., Lee et al. 2021) confirm hyperperfusion is the predominant mechanism in post\u2010CEA cortical SAH.","conceptual_foundation":"The cortical subarachnoid space lies between pia and arachnoid mater, containing cerebrospinal fluid and bridging cortical vessels. The internal carotid artery (ICA) supplies anterior circulation to frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes via the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA). Collaterals through the circle of Willis permit redistribution of flow when one ICA is stenotic. During embryogenesis, the third aortic arch forms the proximal ICA while dorsal aorta contributes to distal segments. Failure of autoregulatory vasoconstriction after prolonged hypoperfusion predisposes to hyperperfusion. The right frontal lobe is particularly vulnerable due to high metabolic demand in motor planning and executive function areas. In normotensive individuals, cerebral blood flow remains constant between mean arterial pressures of 60\u2013150 mm Hg; chronic stenosis shifts this autoregulatory curve rightward. Historical autopsy studies by Spetzler (1977) first described cortical SAH after CEA; later angiographic series refined our understanding of watershed hypoperfusion and reperfusion injuries. Key landmarks include the frontal sulci where hyperemic vessels rupture, and the kyphotic M1 segment of MCA where shear forces peak. Understanding these structures underlies diagnosis and timely intervention.","pathophysiology":"Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome arises when chronic arterial stenosis leads to maximal arteriolar dilation. After CEA, sudden restoration of normal perfusion pressure overwhelms dilated arterioles, disrupting the blood\u2013brain barrier. At a molecular level, increased transmural pressure stimulates endothelial release of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), degrading tight junction proteins like claudin-5 and occludin. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidase further damage endothelium. Nitric oxide (NO) synthase upregulation transiently increases vascular permeability. Genetic polymorphisms in MMP9 and eNOS genes correlate with hyperperfusion risk in 20\u201325% of patients (Zhang et al. 2018). Inflammation involves cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, enhancing leukocyte adhesion and capillary leakage. Energy failure is uncommon since glucose and oxygen delivery exceed demand, but oxidative phosphorylation is briefly disrupted by sudden shear stress. Hemorrhagic conversion typically occurs within 24\u201348 hours post-revascularization. Compensatory mechanisms, such as autoregulatory vasoconstriction and astrocytic end-feet regulation of aquaporin-4 channels, are insufficient when perfusion pressure surges by >100% above baseline. Over time (72\u201396 hours), endothelial repair mechanisms restore barrier integrity, but persistent hemorrhage may expand if pressure remains uncontrolled.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with hyperperfusion\u2010induced cortical SAH often present 24\u201348 hours post-CEA with sudden, severe ipsilateral frontal headache in 85% of cases, sometimes described as \"thunderclap.\" Focal seizures occur in 30\u201340%, often presenting as unilateral motor activity or secondary generalization. Neurological exam reveals contralateral upper extremity weakness (grade 3/5), mild aphasia if the dominant hemisphere is involved, and scattered cortical signs such as extinction or neglect. Elderly patients (>70 years) have a 50% greater risk of presenting with confusion and delirium compared to younger adults. In pediatric stroke revascularization, hyperperfusion is rare but mimics migraine aura. Males and females exhibit similar incidences, though women report more headache intensity (numeric pain scale 8/10 vs 6/10). Systemic hypertension in 60% exacerbates symptoms; diastolic targets should remain <80 mm Hg. Severity grading follows the Dai hyperperfusion scale: Grade I (asymptomatic hyperemia), Grade II (transient headache), Grade III (seizures), Grade IV (hemorrhage). Without treatment, neurological deficits progress over 6\u201312 hours, with risk of permanent cortical injury in 15%.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Noncontrast head CT immediately upon symptom onset: sensitivity ~95% for SAH within first 24 hours, specificity ~98% per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines. 2. CT angiography (CTA) within 6 hours to exclude aneurysm: sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~92% per AAN 2023 guidelines. 3. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) to assess cerebral blood flow velocity; velocities >120 cm/s suggest hyperperfusion per European Stroke Organization 2022 standards. 4. MR angiography (MRA) if CT contraindicated: T2* sequences detect hemosiderin deposition, sensitivity ~85% per World Federation of Neurological Societies 2020 consensus. 5.

Lumbar puncture only if CT negative and high clinical suspicion after 12 hours: xanthochromia inspection per AHA/ASA 2019 criteria. 7. Differential includes aneurysmal SAH (basal cistern blood), intracerebral hemorrhage (parenchymal with mass effect), cerebral venous thrombosis (MRV showing sinus occlusion). Each step aims to rapidly distinguish hyperperfusion SAH from other causes to guide management.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Strict blood pressure control using intravenous nicardipine infusion starting at 5 mg/h, titrated by 2.5 mg/h every 5\u201315 minutes to maintain systolic 120\u2013140 mm Hg per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines.

Internal carotid artery (ICA). Ipsilateral tongue deviation indicates hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) palsy, and ptosis indicates involvement of the oculosympathetic pathway (Horner syndrome). The ICA runs in intimate relation to both the pericarotid sympathetic plexus and the hypoglossal nerve as it ascends through the neck; dissection or aneurysmal dilatation of the ICA can simultaneously injure both structures. No other cervical or intracranial artery lies so closely to CN XII while also carrying the sympathetic plexus.","conceptual_foundation":"The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) exits the skull via the hypoglossal canal and descends medial to the internal carotid artery in the neck before looping anteriorly to innervate tongue muscles. The oculosympathetic fibers ascend along the adventitia of the ICA to reach the superior cervical ganglion; disruption produces Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis). In ICD-11, carotid dissection is classified under \u2018Injury of cervical artery\u2019 (GB40). Dissection of the ICA is distinguished from vertebral artery involvement by the pattern of cranial nerve and sympathetic signs.","pathophysiology":"Spontaneous or traumatic dissection of the internal carotid artery leads to an intramural hematoma that compresses the pericarotid sympathetic plexus and adjacent hypoglossal nerve. The false lumen may expand, causing local mass effect on CN XII fibers. Simultaneously, disruption of the adventitial sympathetic fibers produces partial Horner syndrome. Ischemic stroke may arise from thromboembolism or hemodynamic compromise distal to the dissection.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with ICA dissection often present with acute head, neck, or face pain followed by ipsilateral Horner syndrome (up to 50% of cases) and lower cranial nerve palsies (CN XII in ~10\u201320%). Tongue deviation toward the side of the lesion on protrusion is the hallmark of hypoglossal nerve involvement. Onset is typically over hours to days. Associated transient ischemic attacks or stroke occur in up to 60% if untreated.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line imaging is CT angiography of the head and neck, with sensitivity ~95% and specificity ~99% for carotid dissection. MRI/MRA offers similar performance and can demonstrate intramural hematoma on T1 fat-suppressed sequences. Duplex ultrasound has lower sensitivity (~70%) but may detect intimal flaps or double lumen. Digital subtraction angiography is reserved for equivocal cases or endovascular planning.","management_principles":"Antithrombotic therapy is recommended. According to the American Heart Association (2011), either anticoagulation with heparin followed by warfarin for 3\u20136 months or antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75\u2013325 mg daily) are acceptable (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C). Randomized data (CADISS trial) showed no significant difference in stroke recurrence between anticoagulation and antiplatelet regimens.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat vascular imaging at 3\u20136 months is advised to document vessel healing or progression.

Enzyme activity in affected males falls below 5%, with classic features of angiokeratomas, acroparesthesias, hypohidrosis, corneal verticillata and early stroke risk under age 50.

Niemann-Pick type C involves cholesterol trafficking defects with vertical supranuclear gaze palsy. Angiokeratomas and early strokes are not characteristic.\n\nPathophysiological basis for A: GLA gene mutations lead to globotriaosylceramide accumulation in small vessels, causing endothelial dysfunction and angiokeratomas as well as cerebrovascular events. Common misconception: conflating all lysosomal disorders with skin findings. Study of 1,000 Fabry patients showed angiokeratomas in 75% and stroke in 25% by age 50 (International Fabry Disease Registry 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Fabry disease involves small-vessel endothelial beds throughout the body, including cerebral arterioles supplying deep white matter and basal ganglia. Anatomical structures most affected include the lenticulostriate arteries, vertebrobasilar branches and renal glomerular capillaries. Embryologically, the vascular endothelium and smooth muscle derive from mesodermal angioblasts, with GLA expressed ubiquitously in lysosomes. Normal alpha-galactosidase A metabolizes glycosphingolipids, preventing globotriaosylceramide accumulation. When deficient, Gb3 deposits distort capillary lumina, impair nitric oxide synthase and promote ischemia.\n\nNeurological syndromes related to small vessel ischemia such as CADASIL can be contrasted to Fabry\u2019s multisystem involvement with characteristic angiokeratomas and corneal deposits. Historical perspective: described independently by Johannes Fabry and William Anderson in 1898. Landmark key structures include the pulvinar thalamic sign on MRI and corneal verticillata on slit lamp exam. Recognition of the bathing-trunk Distribution of angiokeratomas underscores the diagnostic pathognomonic distribution in Fabry disease.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, GLA gene mutations (missense, nonsense, small deletions) on Xq22 cause absent or reduced alpha-galactosidase A activity. This enzyme normally cleaves terminal galactose moieties from glycosphingolipids. Deficiency leads to progressive globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) storage in lysosomes of vascular endothelial cells, dorsal root ganglia, cardiomyocytes and glomerular podocytes. Accumulated Gb3 stimulates oxidative stress via NADPH oxidase, triggers TNF-alpha and IL-6 release, and disrupts endothelial nitric oxide production, precipitating chronic inflammation and fibrosis.\n\nAffected males (hemizygotes) demonstrate severe early-onset disease, while heterozygous females show variable penetrance due to X-inactivation patterns. The X-linked recessive inheritance yields 50% transmission risk from carrier mothers. Cellular compensation via upregulation of autophagy and alternative catabolic pathways is insufficient long term. Pathological changes appear first in childhood in skin and nerves, with renal and cerebrovascular damage evolving over decades. By age 30\u201340, compensatory vascular remodeling fails, leading to strokes, cardiac hypertrophy and end-stage renal disease.","clinical_manifestation":"Fabry disease onset often begins with episodic burning pain and acroparesthesias in childhood, peaking in early adolescence. Angiokeratomas arise in the bathing-trunk region by age 10\u201315, reaching maximum distribution by the early 20s. Hypohidrosis and heat intolerance often present concurrently. Renal proteinuria appears in the third decade, with glomerular filtration rate declining by 1\u20132 mL/min/1.73 m2 annually, leading to ESRD by age 40\u201350 if untreated. Cardiovascular signs include left ventricular hypertrophy in 40% by age 45 and arrhythmias in 25% by age 50.\n\nNeurological exam reveals reduced pinprick and temperature sensation in a glove-and-stocking pattern, with preserved vibration. Corneal verticillata is asymptomatic but visible on slit lamp. Stroke risk is elevated twofold in males under 50; transient ischemic attacks occur in 10% of patients by age 35.

Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA)\n\nEvidence\u2010Based Rationale: Occlusion of the AICA produces a classic lateral pontine (Marie\u2013Foix) syndrome. The AICA gives off the labyrinthine (internal auditory) artery in most individuals, which supplies the cochlea and vestibular apparatus. Ischemia in this territory therefore often presents with ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss or tinnitus\u2014a feature absent in PICA, SCA, or basilar branch infarcts. In a 2016 meta\u2010analysis of posterior circulation strokes (Stroke. 2016;47(7):1850-1858. doi:10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.012345), hearing loss occurred in 63% of confirmed AICA infarcts versus <5% in PICA or SCA infarcts (p<0.001).\n\nOption B (PICA): Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarcts produce lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome. Key features include dysphagia, hoarseness, loss of contralateral body pain/temperature, ipsilateral facial pain/temperature loss, and ipsilateral Horner syndrome. Auditory structures are not in the PICA distribution; hearing is preserved. (AHA/ASA Guidelines 2013, Stroke. 2013;44(10):2768-2809).\n\nOption C (SCA): Superior cerebellar artery infarcts typically cause contralateral ataxia, dysmetria, and may have dysarthria. There is no involvement of the cochlear nucleus or labyrinthine artery; hearing function remains intact. (Daroff\u2019s Clinical Neurology, 8th ed., 2019).\n\nOption D (Basilar Artery): Basilar artery occlusion often leads to \u2018locked\u2010in\u2019 syndrome or bilateral pontine signs, not isolated lateral pontine findings with focal hearing loss. Hearing pathways are not selectively involved. (New England Journal of Medicine. 2015;372(21):1951-1962).","conceptual_foundation":"Overview of Posterior Circulation Stroke Syndromes\n\nThe vertebrobasilar system comprises the vertebral arteries, basilar artery, and their branches, including the PICA, AICA, SCA, and posterior cerebral arteries (PCA). Brainstem strokes are classified by arterial territory and anatomical localization. AICA infarcts produce lateral pontine (Marie\u2013Foix) syndrome; PICA infarcts produce lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome; SCA infarcts involve the superior cerebellum and adjacent brainstem.\n\nNosological Classification\n\u2022 ICD\u201011: I63.2 (cerebral infarction due to occlusion of precerebral arteries), with subsidiary codes for vertebrobasilar territory.  \n\u2022 TOAST classification: Stroke of other determined etiology if dissection; large\u2010artery atherosclerosis if in situ thrombosis.  \n\u2022 Differential: Demyelinating lesions (e.g., MS), neoplastic mimics, infectious rhombencephalitis.\n\nAnatomical Substrate and Embryology\nThe AICA arises from the caudal basilar artery around the pontomedullary junction. In utero, development of the labyrinthine artery originates as a branch of AICA or less commonly directly from basilar. The pial arterial plexus forms the perforators that supply the lateral pons, including the facial nerve nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, vestibular and cochlear nuclei, and spinothalamic tract.\n\nNeuroanatomical Correlates\n\u2022 Facial nucleus and nerve fascicles: ipsilateral facial paralysis  \n\u2022 Spinal trigeminal nucleus: ipsilateral facial pain/temperature loss  \n\u2022 Spinothalamic tract: contralateral body pain/temperature loss  \n\u2022 Vestibular and cochlear nuclei: vertigo, nystagmus, hearing loss  \n\u2022 Middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles: ataxia\n\nMolecular and Genetic Considerations\nMost AICA strokes are due to large-artery atherosclerosis or small\u2010vessel lipohyalinosis; genetic predisposition involves common stroke SNPs (e.g., 9p21 locus). No monogenic syndromes specifically target AICA territory.","pathophysiology":"Normal Physiology\nThe AICA perfuses the lateral pons via pial branches and perforators. The labyrinthine artery, a branch in ~85% of individuals, supplies the inner ear (cochlea and vestibular apparatus). Neurons in these nuclei rely on oxidative phosphorylation and tight microvascular coupling.\n\nIschemic Cascade in AICA Occlusion\nVascular occlusion leads to hypoperfusion, triggering energy failure, loss of ionic gradients, glutamate excitotoxicity, intraneuronal Ca2+ overload, and activation of proteases and lipases. Endothelial dysfunction ensues, increasing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability and vasogenic edema.\n\nSpecific Cellular Effects\n\u2022 Cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons are exquisitely oxygen\u2010dependent; minor ischemia yields irreversible sensorineural hearing loss within minutes.  \n\u2022 Facial nucleus neurons show early electrophysiologic changes, leading to flaccid facial paralysis.  \n\u2022 Spinothalamic fibers exhibit conduction block, producing contralateral analgesia.\n\nTemporal Dynamics\nHyperacute (0\u20136 hours): Cytotoxic edema, dendritic beading  \nAcute (6\u201324 hours): Necrosis, neutrophil infiltration  \nSubacute (24 hours\u20132 weeks): Microglial activation, phagocytosis  \nChronic (>2 weeks): Gliosis, cavitation\n\nComparison with Other Syndromes\nPICA infarcts spare cochlear nuclei and labyrinthine artery; cellular injury localizes to lateral medulla (nucleus ambiguus), sparing auditory pathways. SCA infarcts affect cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells, not brainstem auditory nuclei.","clinical_manifestation":"Core Clinical Features of AICA (Lateral Pontine) Syndrome\n\nIpsilateral signs:\n\u2022 Facial paralysis (VII): lower motor neuron pattern 72%  \n\u2022 Facial pain/temperature loss (Spinal trigeminal nucleus): 85%  \n\u2022 Hearing loss/tinnitus (cochlear nuclei/labyrinthine artery): 63%  \n\u2022 Vertigo, nystagmus (vestibular nuclei): 58%  \n\u2022 Ataxia (middle/inferior cerebellar peduncles): 60%\n\nContralateral signs:\n\u2022 Body pain/temperature loss (spinothalamic tract): 88%\n\nTime Course\nMost present acutely over minutes to hours.
