Option B (direct thrombin inhibitor) pertains to anticoagulation (e.g., dabigatran) and does not affect cholinergic signaling. Option C (NMDA receptor antagonist) describes memantine, used in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer disease but with a different mechanism. Option D (ACE inhibitor) is used for hypertension and heart failure and has no role in Alzheimer pathology.","conceptual_foundation":"Alzheimer disease involves progressive loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, leading to reduced acetylcholine in hippocampus and cortex. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, aim to restore cholinergic neurotransmission. Donepezil selectively and reversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase without significant peripheral nicotinic effects, enhancing central cholinergic function.","pathophysiology":"In Alzheimer disease, amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation cause synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss, especially of cholinergic neurons. Acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses. Inhibition of this enzyme by donepezil increases acetylcholine availability, partially compensating for the cholinergic deficit and improving signal transmission in hippocampal and cortical circuits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease present with memory impairment, executive dysfunction, language difficulties, and visuospatial deficits. Donepezil treatment yields modest improvements in cognition measured by MMSE or ADAS-Cog (mean difference ~2\u20133 points at 24 weeks). Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea in ~20%, diarrhea in ~10%) and bradycardia.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of Alzheimer disease relies on clinical criteria (NIA-AA 2011, revised 2018) supported by neuroimaging (MRI showing medial temporal atrophy) and biomarkers (CSF A\u03b242, tau). A positive clinical response to donepezil is supportive but not diagnostic. Baseline ECG should be obtained to assess for bradyarrhythmias before initiation.","management_principles":"According to AAN 2018 guidelines (Level A), donepezil is recommended as first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Alzheimer's disease","Frontotemporal dementia","Lewy body dementia","Vascular dementia"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Frontotemporal dementia","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Alzheimer\u2019s disease often presents with early episodic memory loss, hippocampal volume loss on MRI, and posterior cingulate hypometabolism on FDG-PET. In a 75-year-old with insidious memory decline, CSF A\u03b242\u2193 and tau\u2191 (A\u03b242/tau ratio <0.8 in ~85% of cases) might mislead toward AD, but predominant frontal dysfunction is atypical for primary AD. Pathologically, AD features extracellular amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau in hippocampus and association cortices. \nOption B: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is characterized by progressive behavioral changes, disinhibition, apathy, or language impairment, with frontotemporal atrophy on MRI, most likely in a 58-year-old with prominent personality change. Underlying inclusions are tau (50%) or TDP-43 (45%) pathology. FTD accounts for ~10\u201320% of early-onset dementias. Misconceptions include equating all early dementia with AD rather than considering FTD when executive dysfunction predominates. \nOption C: Lewy body dementia typically presents with visual hallucinations (75%), fluctuating cognition, parkinsonism, and occipital hypometabolism; MRI often shows preserved hippocampi. Onset in the late sixties with prominent visual phenomena and REM sleep behavior disorder might suggest LBD, but frontotemporal atrophy is minimal. \nOption D: Vascular dementia features stepwise decline, focal deficits, white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas grade \u22652 in ~60%), and lacunar infarcts. A history of stroke or uncontrolled vascular risk factors would raise suspicion, but symmetric frontal and temporal lobe atrophy without corresponding vascular lesions supports FTD. \nPathophysiological basis: FTD results from selective degeneration of von Economo neurons in anterior cingulate and frontoinsular cortex, with tau or TDP-43 aggregates disrupting synaptic connectivity, leading to characteristic behavioral and language syndromes.","conceptual_foundation":"Frontotemporal dementia primarily involves degeneration of the frontal lobes (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate) and anterior temporal lobes (temporal pole, amygdala). Fiber tracts implicated include the uncinate fasciculus connecting orbitofrontal and anterior temporal regions, and the superior longitudinal fasciculus supporting executive and language networks. Embryologically, these regions derive from the telencephalon and undergo late cortical maturation, rendering them vulnerable to proteinopathies in midlife. Normal physiology relies on dopaminergic modulation of prefrontal circuits for executive function, and cholinergic input to temporal regions for semantic memory. Syndromes overlapping FTD include primary progressive aphasia variants, corticobasal syndrome, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Historically, Arnold Pick described focal frontal atrophy in 1892, and Alzheimer later identified Pick bodies in 1911. The term \u201cPick\u2019s disease\u201d became loosely applied to all FTD phenotypes before differentiation by molecular pathology. Important landmarks on imaging include widening of the Sylvian fissure and frontal horn of lateral ventricles, anterior temporal sulcal prominence, and cortical thinning quantifiable via volumetric analysis. Recognition of these anatomical and developmental factors underpins targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in modern FTD care.","pathophysiology":"Frontotemporal dementia arises from accumulation of misfolded proteins\u2014either microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) or transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)\u2014within neurons and glia. Tauopathies involve hyperphosphorylation at serine-202 and threonine-205, leading to paired helical filaments that disrupt microtubule stability and axonal transport. TDP-43 pathologies feature ubiquitinated, phosphorylated aggregates in cytoplasm, impairing RNA splicing. Genetic mutations underlie ~40% of cases: MAPT mutations (e.g., exon 10 splicing variant N279K), progranulin (GRN) null mutations causing haploinsufficiency, and hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72 producing toxic dipeptide repeats via repeat-associated non-ATG translation. Neuroinflammation with microglial activation releases TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, exacerbating neuronal loss. Mitochondrial dysfunction reduces ATP production in vulnerable Von Economo neurons, accelerating synaptic failure. Early compensatory synaptic sprouting may transiently preserve function, but progressive network disconnection over 5\u20137 years overwhelms compensation. Lysosomal clearance pathways become impaired, leading to further aggregate accumulation. Ultimately, selective vulnerability of frontal and temporal projection neurons results in characteristic cognitive and behavioral syndromes, distinguishing FTD from other proteinopathies.","clinical_manifestation":"FTD typically begins insidiously between ages 45 and 65, with median age of onset 58 years. Behavioral variant (bvFTD) presents first with personality change: disinhibition (e.g., inappropriate comments), apathy, loss of empathy, compulsive rituals, hyperorality, and dietary shifts in 70% of cases. Semantic variant PPA shows fluent speech but profound naming difficulty and single-word comprehension loss. Nonfluent variant PPA exhibits effortful, agrammatic speech with preserved comprehension. Neurological exam may reveal primitive reflexes (e.g., palmomental, grasp), executive dysfunction on Stroop and trail making tests, and relative sparing of visuospatial skills. Pediatric and juvenile FTD are rare but manifest similar features. Male predominance is slight (ratio ~1.3:1). Systemic features include weight gain and parkinsonism in ~30%, with autonomic changes rare. Severity is quantified using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale with FTD module (FTD-CDR), where scores \u22651 indicate mild impairment. Red flags for alternative diagnoses include rapid progression (<1 year) suggesting prion disease or HIV. Without intervention, median survival is 6\u20138 years post onset, with progressive decline leading to death from aspiration or infection.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

Obtain routine labs (CBC, metabolic panel) every six months when on SSRIs or antipsychotics to detect hyponatremia or metabolic syndrome. Repeat MRI annually to monitor atrophy progression; FDG-PET every two years if clinical trial enrollment is considered. Document one-year survival at ~85% and five-year survival at ~20%.

This presentation is classic for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Option A (Trial of dopaminergic therapy) is incorrect because parkinsonian features in NPH typically do not respond to levodopa. Trials have demonstrated <10% sustained gait improvement with dopaminergic drugs (Kazui et al., 2015). Option B (Deep brain stimulation) is not indicated in NPH. Deep brain stimulation is reserved for movement disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and essential tremor. Option D (Symptomatic treatment only) fails to address the potentially reversible cause of symptoms. Shunting can improve gait, cognition, and continence in up to 70% of appropriately selected patients (Williams et al., 2019), with level B evidence per AAN guidelines (2006).","conceptual_foundation":"Normal pressure hydrocephalus is classified under \u2018communicating hydrocephalus\u2019 in ICD-11 (GB21.1). The clinical triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965. Differential diagnoses include Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, vascular parkinsonism, and subcortical small-vessel ischemic disease. NPH arises from impaired CSF absorption at the arachnoid granulations, leading to ventricular enlargement without significantly elevated opening pressures. Embryologically, the choroid plexus and ventricular system form from the roof plate of the neural tube; CSF homeostasis depends on an intact arachnoid villi network.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology maintains a balance between CSF production by choroid plexus and absorption via arachnoid granulations. In NPH, CSF absorption rates decrease, resulting in gradual ventricular enlargement. The enlarged ventricles stretch periventricular white matter tracts, especially corticospinal fibers (affecting gait) and fibers to the medial frontal micturition centers (causing incontinence). Ventricular dilation also compresses fronto-subcortical circuits, leading to apathy and executive dysfunction. Chronic periventricular ischemia may further exacerbate cognitive decline.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with NPH most commonly present in the seventh decade. Gait disturbance is the earliest and most prominent symptom, characterized by a broad-based, short-step, magnetic gait. Cognitive impairment is subcortical in nature, with slowed processing and executive dysfunction; MMSE scores are typically in the mild to moderate range (20\u201326). Urinary urgency progressing to incontinence occurs in up to 75% of patients. The natural history without treatment is progressive disability and risk of falls.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes noncontrast MRI demonstrating ventriculomegaly (Evans index >0.3) and periventricular hyperintensities. A large-volume (30\u201350 mL) high-volume lumbar tap test with pre- and post-gait assessments has sensitivity of 58\u201383% and specificity of 75\u2013100% for shunt responsiveness (AAN 2006, Level B). Supplemental testing may include continuous intracranial pressure monitoring or extended lumbar drainage trials.","management_principles":"Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is the treatment of choice. Programmable valves with anti-siphon devices reduce over-drainage complications. Meta-analyses report gait improvement in 60\u201380% of patients, cognitive improvement in 30\u201360%, and incontinence improvement in 50% (Williams et al. 2019). Perioperative complication rates (infection, subdural hematoma) range from 10\u201320%. Medical management alone has no disease-modifying effect in NPH.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-shunt monitoring includes serial clinical assessments at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, with attention to gait, cognition (MoCA/MMSE), and continence. MRI or CT head at 3\u20136 months assesses ventricular size and rule out subdural collections. Valve pressure adjustments are guided by symptom recurrence or imaging findings. Long-term follow-up should include evaluation for shunt malfunction or infection.","clinical_pearls":"1. A high-volume lumbar tap test that temporarily improves gait predicts shunt responsiveness in NPH. 2. Ventricular enlargement with disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid spaces over the convexities (DESH) supports NPH diagnosis. 3. Shunt over-drainage may present as subdural hygromas or headaches; programmable valves help mitigate this. 4. NPH is one of the few reversible causes of dementia; timely referral is crucial. 5.

Large population studies (e.g., Lopez et al., 2019) report LBD prevalence at 12.5% compared to AD at ~60% and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) at 2\u20135%. Vascular dementia is not classified as neurodegenerative. Clinical diagnostic criteria (McKeith et al., 2017) further delineate LBD features\u2014cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism\u2014that distinguish it from FTD and vascular etiologies. Common misconceptions arise from conflating vascular and degenerative dementias; however, pathology and in vivo neuroimaging (DaTscan) confirm LBD-specific alpha-synuclein deposition.","conceptual_foundation":"Dementias are categorized into neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative etiologies.

Key prerequisites include understanding proteinopathies: AD (amyloid-beta and tau), LBD (alpha-synuclein), and FTD (tau, TDP-43, FUS). Neuroanatomically, LBD affects cortex and subcortex, particularly occipital and parietal lobes for visuospatial deficits, basal ganglia for parkinsonism, and brainstem nuclei for REM sleep behavior disorder. Embryologically, the mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons implicated in LBD derive from the midbrain floor plate, whereas cortical neurons harbor synuclein aggregates. Molecular genetics reveal SNCA gene involvement with alpha-synuclein overexpression in familial cases.","pathophysiology":"Normal cognition relies on cholinergic transmission in basal forebrain to cortex and dopaminergic signaling in nigrostriatal pathways. In LBD, misfolded alpha-synuclein forms intraneuronal Lewy bodies, triggering neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. Complement activation and microglial priming contribute to neuronal loss. Compared to AD, where extracellular amyloid plaques and tau tangles dominate, LBD features intracellular synuclein pathology leading to diffuse cortical and subcortical degeneration. Early dopaminergic neuron loss in substantia nigra pars compacta explains parkinsonism; occipital hypometabolism underlies visual hallucinations. Longitudinal studies (Hamilton et al., 2020) show progressive synuclein spread from brainstem to cortex via prion-like mechanisms.","clinical_manifestation":"LBD presents with progressive cognitive decline, pronounced fluctuations (~70% of cases), well-formed visual hallucinations (~80%), REM sleep behavior disorder (~65%), and parkinsonian motor signs (~75%).

FTD presents with prominent behavioral changes or primary language deficits without early parkinsonism or hallucinations. Vascular dementia shows stepwise decline with focal neurological signs.

B. High-dose Vitamin E: Vitamin E at 2,000 IU/day was tested in the PREADViSE trial (n=3,000) with follow-up at 4 years; conversion rate to dementia was 25.1% versus 23.8% for placebo (p=0.28). Increased all-cause mortality risk rose by 4.7% if doses exceeded 1,000 IU/day. No recommendation supports Vitamin E monotherapy in MCI. C. Donepezil: Donepezil 5\u201310 mg nightly has been trialed in MCI cohorts, showing transient improvements in memory tests at 3 months but no reduction in conversion over 2 years (conversion 17.8% versus 18.2%, p=0.67). It is sometimes used off-label for amnestic MCI with prominent cholinergic deficits, but evidence remains negative. D. Memantine: Memantine 10\u201320 mg daily is indicated for moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease; studies in MCI (n=210) over 18 months showed no cognitive stabilization (ADAS-cog change +5.2 vs +5.0, p=0.51). It may be considered in vascular cognitive impairment but not pure MCI. None: Current consensus guidelines (DSM-5, International Working Group 2020) assert no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for MCI. Pathophysiologically, MCI lacks the widespread cholinergic deficit and amyloid burden seen in established dementia, so cholinesterase inhibition or NMDA antagonism fails to alter the disease course. Common misconceptions include extrapolating Alzheimer's therapies to MCI and mistaking modest test score improvements for disease modification. Multiple meta-analyses (2017 Cochrane, 2019 JAMA Neurology) underscore lack of efficacy and potential harm, cementing \u201cNone\u201d as the correct choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) primarily involves early dysfunction of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampal CA1\u2013CA4 fields, and adjacent parahippocampal gyrus. These structures belong to the limbic lobe, relaying through the perforant pathway into the dentate gyrus, then via mossy fibers to CA3 and Schaffer collaterals to CA1. Embryologically, the hippocampus arises from the medial pallium at gestational weeks 8\u201312, creating neuroepithelial precursors key to episodic memory. Normal physiology includes long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 mediated by NMDA receptor\u2013dependent calcium influx and AMPA receptor insertion, regulated by cholinergic input from the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Early amnestic MCI (aMCI) shares pathophysiological overlap with early Alzheimer\u2019s pathology but remains compensated by synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis, peaking at ages 30\u201340 and persisting at low levels into late life. Related conditions include subjective cognitive decline (SCD), vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Historically, MCI was defined by Petersen in 1999 as transitional between normal aging and dementia, evolving through revisions in 2001 (memory\u2010predominant subtype) and 2011 (International Working Group criteria). Key anatomical landmarks: the collateral sulcus demarcates parahippocampal cortex, the subiculum bridges hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and the fimbria\u2013fornix complex conveys hippocampal output to mammillary bodies\u2014clinically significant in Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome but preserved in MCI.","pathophysiology":"MCI pathology begins with synaptic dysfunction in hippocampal CA1, driven by oligomeric A\u03b242 binding to alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and impairing NMDA receptor\u2013mediated currents. Downstream, tau hyperphosphorylation via GSK3\u03b2 and Cdk5 disrupts microtubule stability, leading to early neurofibrillary tangles in layer II entorhinal cortex by Braak stage I\u2013II. On a cellular level, astrocytic reactivity releases proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and complement C3 within 6\u201312 months of symptom onset. Microglial TREM2 mutations (R47H variant) increase MCI\u2010to\u2010Alzheimer\u2019s conversion risk by 2.5\u2010fold. Mitochondrial dysfunction with reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity lowers ATP production by 30% in hippocampal neurons, impairing Na+/K+\u2010ATPase pumps. Genetic factors include APOE \u03b54 allele, doubling the risk of progression from MCI to dementia within 24 months; progranulin GRN mutations cause frontal variant MCI phenotypes. Cellular compensatory synaptogenesis through BDNF upregulation can transiently sustain memory function, though by 18 months postsynaptic density protein 95 declines by 15%\u201320%, overwhelming plasticity. The temporal cascade: soluble A\u03b2 oligomers accumulate over 1\u20135 years, tau pathology emerges at 2\u20133 years, and clinical conversion often occurs by year 4\u20135. Blood\u2013brain barrier permeability increases by 25% in early stages, enabling peripheral immune cell infiltration that exacerbates local inflammation but remains below threshold for overt dementia.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of amnestic MCI is insidious over 6\u201318 months, with patients reporting forgetfulness for recent events, misplacing objects, and difficulty recalling appointments. Neuropsychological testing reveals performance 1.0\u20131.5 SD below age\u2010adjusted norms on memory tasks (e.g., Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall scoring 5\u20137 words vs normal 8\u201312). Neurological exam is typically normal, though subtle executive dysfunction may appear as delayed alternating sequences on trail making B (time 80\u2013120 seconds vs typical <50 seconds). Elderly patients (>65 years) more commonly present with single\u2010domain aMCI, whereas younger cohorts (<60 years) may show multi\u2010domain deficits including visuospatial impairments. Gender differences: women often exhibit greater episodic memory decline, men more executive and visuospatial issues. Systemic signs are absent, but comorbid hypertension and type 2 diabetes appear in 45% of patients, potentially accelerating progression. Severity scales: Clinical Dementia Rating\u2010sum of boxes (CDR\u2010SB) typically 0.5\u20131.0; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) ranges 22\u201325/30. Red flags include rapid decline (>3 points on MoCA within 6 months), early gait disturbance, or visual hallucinations suggesting Lewy body pathology. Without intervention, natural history shows 10%\u201315% annual conversion to dementia; by 5 years, up to 50% progress, though 20% may remain stable or revert to normal cognition.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history and cognitive screening. Use MoCA (sensitivity 90%, specificity 87%), MMSE (sensitivity 79%, specificity 86%). Step 2: Lab tests to exclude reversible causes: TSH (0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L), Vitamin B12 (>400 pg/mL), folate (>4 ng/mL), RPR, Lyme serology if endemic. Step 3: Neuroimaging with MRI brain using volumetric 3D T1 sequence: hippocampal atrophy quantification (>1.5 SD below norm) and FLAIR for white-matter hyperintensities (Fazekas score 1\u20132). CT if MRI contraindicated. Step 4: CSF analysis in atypical or rapidly progressive cases: A\u03b242 (<400 pg/mL), total tau (>350 pg/mL), phosphorylated tau (>60 pg/mL). Step 5: PET imaging for amyloid (PiB\u2010PET) or tau tracers in research settings. Step 6: Electrophysiology: EEG may show diffuse slowing (theta rhythm increases of 20\u201330% power), rarely used. Step 7: Neuropsychological battery specifying memory, language, executive function; differentiate Alzheimer\u2019s MCI from vascular or Lewy body MCI. Differential: depression (\u201cpseudodementia,\u201d Beck Depression Inventory >20), medication effects (anticholinergics), B12 deficiency, normal pressure hydrocephalus (gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, MRI Evans\u2019 index >0.3). Decision points pivot on reversible cause exclusion and MRI structural integrity before labeling MCI.","management_principles":"No pharmacologic agents are FDA\u2010approved for treatment of MCI. First\u2010line management focuses on lifestyle interventions: aerobic exercise (150 minutes/week at 60% maximal heart rate), cognitive training (45\u2010minute sessions, twice weekly), and Mediterranean diet adherence (\u22652 servings fish/week, \u22653 servings vegetables/day). Blood pressure targets: systolic <130 mmHg per SPRINT\u2010MIND trial reduced MCI incidence by 19% over median 3 years. Statin therapy with atorvastatin 20\u201340 mg daily may slow progression in hyperlipidemic patients (LDL <70 mg/dL target). Secondary options: cholinesterase inhibitors may be trialed off\u2010label for symptomatic relief at rivastigmine 1.5 mg BID titrated to 6 mg BID if tolerated (nausea 25%, dizziness 12%). Memantine at 5 mg daily titrated to 20 mg daily used in vascular MCI subtype but lacks robust evidence. Drug interactions: cholinesterase inhibitors contraindicated with succinylcholine; memantine requires dose reduction by 50% if CrCl <30 mL/min. Nonpharmacological: cognitive behavioral therapy for depression (Beck Depression Inventory score reduction 30% in MCI\u2010depressed cohort), sleep hygiene to reduce A\u03b2 accumulation. No surgical options. Monitoring every 6 months with MoCA and functional activities questionnaire. Manage complications like falls risk via physical therapy. Special populations: in renal impairment (eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m2), avoid high\u2010dose memantine; pregnancy counseling focuses on nonpharmacologic approaches due to teratogenic unknowns.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients with MCI should be re\u2010evaluated every 6 months with cognitive screening (MoCA, target improvement >2 points). Laboratory tests (TSH, B12) annually. MRI brain repeated every 12\u201324 months if progression suspected; consider volumetric change >3% per year as significant. Monitor blood pressure every 3 months to maintain <130/80 mmHg. Assess functional independence using FAQ scale biannually, aiming score <9. Long\u2010term complications: conversion to dementia in 10%\u201315% per year, falls in 20%\u201330%, depression in 15%. One\u2010year prognosis remains stable in 30% of patients; five\u2010year dementia risk approximates 50% for amnestic MCI. Rehabilitation: start cognitive rehabilitation within 3 months of diagnosis; physical therapy for gait training within 6 weeks if dual\u2010task impairment. Patient education: emphasize physical activity benefits, healthy sleep, social engagement. Driving recommendations: reassess driving fitness if MoCA falls below 20 or CDR-SB exceeds 2. Support resources include Alzheimer\u2019s Association (www.alz.org) and local memory clinics, with referral within 4 weeks of MCI diagnosis for counseling and caregiver support.","clinical_pearls":"1. MCI conversion risk: 10%\u201315% per year; amnestic subtype highest at 12% annual risk. 2. MoCA (>26 normal) outperforms MMSE in MCI detection (90% vs 78%). 3. Petersen\u2019s criteria emphasize memory impairment without ADL decline. 4. Cholinesterase inhibitors show transient cognitive test gains but no disease-modifying effect. 5.
