[{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient came with right optic atrophy and left papilledema. Where is the localization of the mass?","options":["Left frontal","Right frontal","Right occipital","Left occipital"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Right frontal","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer B (Right frontal). Ipsilateral optic atrophy arises from direct compression of the right optic nerve by a frontal mass, while raised intracranial pressure causes papilledema in the left eye. Left frontal (A) would produce left atrophy and right papilledema. Right occipital (C) and left occipital (D) involve visual cortex, not direct optic nerve compression, and thus do not produce this pattern of atrophy and papilledema.","conceptual_foundation":"Foster-Kennedy syndrome describes optic atrophy ipsilateral to a frontal lobe lesion with contralateral papilledema due to raised intracranial pressure. In ICD-11, this falls under intracranial neoplasms (2C71). Differential diagnoses include idiopathic intracranial hypertension, optic nerve sheath meningioma, and optic neuritis. First described in 1911 by Foster and Kennedy, it remains a cornerstone of neuro-ophthalmic localization. The optic nerve\u2019s proximity to the falx and frontal lobe explains its vulnerability to parasagittal masses.","pathophysiology":"Direct compression of the optic nerve by a frontal lobe tumor causes axonal degeneration, myelin loss, and eventual optic atrophy. Simultaneously, mass effect elevates intracranial pressure, impeding axoplasmic flow at the contralateral optic disc and producing papilledema. The compressed nerve head\u2019s vascular supply is compromised, preventing papilledema on the ipsilateral side. This dual mechanism underlies the asymmetric fundoscopic findings.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report progressive visual loss in the eye ipsilateral to the mass, often with decreased color discrimination and central or centrocecal scotomas. Contralateral papilledema may present with transient visual obscurations, headaches, nausea, and other raised intracranial pressure signs. Visual field testing typically shows an afferent pupillary defect on the side of atrophy. Neurological examination may reveal subtle frontal lobe signs such as personality changes or executive dysfunction.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial fundoscopic exam confirms optic atrophy on the right and papilledema on the left. MRI with contrast of the brain and orbits is first-line to identify frontal lobe masses (meningioma, glioma). CT may reveal hyperostosis in meningioma. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated until imaging excludes mass lesion. Visual evoked potentials can quantify optic nerve dysfunction. Systemic workup for neoplasm includes CT chest/abdomen for metastases if indicated.","management_principles":"Surgical resection via frontal craniotomy is primary, aiming for gross total removal. Preoperative dexamethasone reduces peritumoral edema. Radiotherapy (fractionated or stereotactic radiosurgery) is reserved for residual or inoperable tumors. Management of raised intracranial pressure includes head elevation, hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol), and ventriculoperitoneal shunting if needed. Visual prognosis improves with early decompression; chronic compression beyond 6 weeks portends poor recovery.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI at 3 and 12 months assesses residual or recurrent tumor. Ophthalmology follow-up every 6 months monitors optic disc, visual acuity, and fields. Annual imaging for low-grade meningiomas for 5 years, then biennially if stable. Monitor for delayed recurrence, new neurological signs, and long-term radiation effects. Visual rehabilitation includes field training and low-vision aids.","clinical_pearls":"1. Ipsilateral optic atrophy with contralateral papilledema localizes to the ipsilateral anterior cranial fossa (Foster-Kennedy syndrome). 2. Steroids can reduce peritumoral edema but may obscure diagnostic imaging. 3. Duration of optic nerve compression <6 weeks predicts favorable visual recovery. 4. Performing LP before imaging in suspected mass lesions risks herniation. 5. Frontal meningiomas often present with personality changes before visual symptoms.","references":"1. Foster-Kennedy W.

The trochlear nerve has the longest intracranial course and decussates within the superior medullary velum, making it highly susceptible to traction injuries from head trauma, which account for over 50% of acquired CN IV palsies. Infarction (A) due to microvascular ischemia is uncommon (<5%) and typically occurs in diabetic vasculopathy, presenting without traumatic history.","conceptual_foundation":"Trochlear nerve palsy manifests with vertical diplopia exacerbated on downgaze and head tilt toward the opposite shoulder (Park\u2019s\u2013Bielschowsky head tilt test positive). In ICD-11, it is classified under cranial nerve mononeuropathy (8A80). Differential includes skew deviation, thyroid ophthalmopathy, and myasthenia gravis. Embryologically, the trochlear nucleus arises dorsally in the midbrain, unlike other cranial nerves, explaining its unique vulnerability.","pathophysiology":"Traumatic acceleration\u2013deceleration forces shear the delicate CN IV fibers as they exit dorsally from the midbrain and loop around the cerebral peduncles. Intraneural microhemorrhages, ischemia of the vasa nervorum, and Wallerian degeneration lead to denervation of the superior oblique muscle. In contrast, microvascular infarction selectively compromises small endoneurial vessels but is rare.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely with vertical diplopia, worsened on downgaze and reading, often adopting a compensatory head tilt toward the contralateral shoulder to minimize hypertropia. On examination, hypertropia of the affected eye increases on adduction and depression. The Bielschowsky head tilt test shows increased hypertropia when the head is tilted toward the side of the lesion.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: thorough neuro-ophthalmic examination including cover\u2013uncover and head tilt tests. Noncontrast head CT with bone windows is indicated emergently in trauma to exclude fractures. MRI brainstem/orbits with thin slices evaluates nerve integrity and excludes mass lesions. Laboratory workup for diabetes, vasculitis, and infectious causes is reserved for nontraumatic cases.","management_principles":"Acute diplopia is managed conservatively with occlusion or prism glasses. Botulinum toxin injection of the ipsilateral inferior oblique can provide temporary alignment. Most traumatic palsies recover spontaneously within 3\u20136 months. If significant misalignment persists beyond 6 months, strabismus surgery (superior oblique tendon tuck or inferior oblique recession) is indicated. Control of vascular risk factors is essential in ischemic cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess alignment and ocular motility at 1, 3, and 6 months. Repeat imaging if no improvement or if new neurological signs emerge. Orthoptic measurements guide prism adjustments or surgical planning. In pediatric patients, monitor for amblyopia, and refer to vision therapy early. Counsel on fall prevention due to head tilt and diplopia.","clinical_pearls":"1. CN IV palsy is the most common isolated vertical diplopia cause in trauma. 2. The head tilt test localizes superior oblique weakness. 3. Trauma accounts for >50% of acquired CN IV palsies. 4. Beware of coexistent cranial nerve injuries in head injuries. 5. Spontaneous recovery usually occurs within 6 months post-trauma.","references":"1. Knox J, Wang MX, Houston R.

The LGN is supplied primarily by the lateral posterior choroidal artery. An MCA infarct causes broad homonymous deficits; the anterior choroidal artery infarct causes homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing rather than a wedge sector. Thus, option C is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Visual field defects are classified by anatomic location: lesions anterior to the optic chiasm cause monocular deficits; post-chiasmal lesions cause homonymous defects. Sectoranopias\u2014wedge-shaped defects sparing the horizontal meridian\u2014are characteristic of LGN lesions, which occupy the parietal lobe\u2019s deep structures and receive vascular supply from the lateral posterior choroidal arteries branching off the posterior cerebral artery.","pathophysiology":"Infarction of the lateral posterior choroidal artery leads to ischemia of specific LGN layers, disrupting transmission of retinal ganglion cell axons from corresponding visual field quadrants. The horizontal meridian is spared because the interlaminar plexus serving central field projections remains intact, producing a pie-shaped scotoma without horizontal boundary involvement.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically report a wedge-shaped area of visual loss in one quadrant of the visual field, often discovered on confrontation testing or formal perimetry. They retain the perception of the horizontal line due to sparing of fibers near the calcarine fissure, distinguishing sectoranopia from quadrantanopia (which respects the horizontal meridian).","diagnostic_approach":"Gold-standard diagnosis is automated perimetry demonstrating the sectoranopic defect. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging localizes the infarct to the LGN. MR angiography may show occlusion of the lateral posterior choroidal artery. Visual evoked potentials can assist in confirming post-chiasmal localization.","management_principles":"Management follows posterior circulation stroke protocols: antiplatelet therapy (aspirin), control of vascular risk factors (BP, lipids, diabetes), and secondary prevention measures. No direct thrombolysis is indicated outside the standard time window unless additional deficits are present. Rehabilitation includes visual field training and compensatory strategies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat neuroimaging within 24\u201348 hours to assess infarct evolution. Serial perimetry at intervals (e.g., 1 month, 3 months) to monitor recovery or stability of field defects. Occupational therapy referral for adaptive techniques in daily living.","clinical_pearls":"1. Sectoranopias localize to the LGN. 2. Lateral posterior choroidal artery infarcts are rare but produce distinctive wedge defects. 3. Always perform confrontation fields in stroke patients. 4. Sparing of the horizontal meridian distinguishes sectoranopia from quadrantanopia. 5. Visual rehabilitation can improve quality of life even without field recovery.","references":"1.

Where is the lesion?","options":["Left midbrain","Right midbrain"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Right midbrain","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct answer B (Right midbrain). Left eye hypertropia with skew deviation and head tilt to the right localizes to the right dorsal midbrain, disrupting the otolithic-ocular pathways. A left midbrain lesion (A) would produce hypertropia of the right eye and head tilt to the left. Peripheral vestibular lesions and fourth nerve palsies cannot explain this central skew reaction with contralateral hypertropia.","conceptual_foundation":"Skew deviation is a vertical misalignment of the eyes due to supranuclear lesions affecting otolith input to ocular motor nuclei, classified under ICD-11 EB27.0. The ocular tilt reaction triad includes skew deviation, ocular torsion, and head tilt. Differential diagnoses include fourth nerve palsy, thyroid eye disease, and myasthenia gravis. Embryologically, vestibular nuclei in the medulla send uncrossed and crossed projections via the rostral MLF through the midbrain.","pathophysiology":"A lesion in the right otolithic pathway within the dorsal midbrain abolishes tonic input from the utricle on that side, causing unopposed activity of contralateral vestibular input. This leads to hyperdeviation of the eye contralateral to the lesion (left eye) and compensatory head tilt toward the side of the lesion (right). Involvement of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal disrupts vertical gaze and head-position integration.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients experience vertical diplopia and subjective tilt of the visual world, with ocular torsion evident on fundus exam. Head tilt toward the right minimizes the hypertropia. The hypertropic eye is contralateral to the lesion (left). Symptoms often accompany other brainstem signs such as skewed vertical pursuit or gaze palsies, and may present acutely in stroke or demyelination.","diagnostic_approach":"Neuro-ophthalmic examination quantifies vertical misalignment and performs the head tilt test. Fundus evaluation detects ocular torsion. Brain MRI with thin sections through the midbrain identifies lesions (infarct, demyelination, hemorrhage). Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) distinguish central from peripheral etiologies. Forced duction testing differentiates skew deviation from mechanical restriction.","management_principles":"Treatment targets the underlying pathology: thrombolysis or antiplatelet therapy in stroke, high-dose steroids in demyelination, or surgical removal in mass lesions. Acute diplopia is managed with prisms or occlusion. Vestibular rehabilitation and head posture training aid compensation. Persistent skew deviation may warrant vertical muscle surgery after stabilization of the lesion.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat MRI at 3\u20136 months for demyelinating lesions or infarcts. Orthoptic assessment at each follow-up determines need for prism adjustment or surgical intervention. Monitor for new brainstem signs or lesion progression. Recommend vestibular therapy referrals for residual imbalance. Educate patients on fall prevention due to head tilt and visual disorientation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Skew deviation with head tilt localizes to brainstem otolithic pathways, not peripheral nerve. 2. Contraversive head tilt (to the right) indicates right-sided lesion. 3. Ocular torsion on fundus exam differentiates central skew from fourth nerve palsy. 4. Forced duction is negative in skew deviation. 5. Acute skew in stroke requires emergent neuroimaging.","references":"1. Kushner BJ. Skew deviation versus fourth nerve palsy.
