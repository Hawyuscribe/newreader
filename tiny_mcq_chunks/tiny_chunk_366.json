Option B is incorrect because ocular MG is most often associated with anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibodies, not anti-striational antibodies. Option C is incorrect as anti-striational antibodies do not predict steroid resistance; their presence guides evaluation for thymoma.","conceptual_foundation":"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by antibodies against components of the neuromuscular junction. The thymus plays a central role in MG pathogenesis, and thymoma occurs in ~10\u201315% of patients. Anti-striational antibodies target skeletal muscle proteins and serve as paraneoplastic markers.","pathophysiology":"Thymoma-associated MG involves aberrant thymic epithelial cell expression of muscle antigens, leading to B-cell activation and production of antibodies (e.g., anti-titin) that fix complement and disrupt neuromuscular transmission, causing fluctuating weakness.","clinical_manifestation":"Thymoma MG often presents with early bulbar involvement, rapid generalization of weakness, and higher rates of respiratory crises. Anti-striational antibodies correlate with more severe disease and thymic pathology.","diagnostic_approach":"Confirm MG with AChR and MuSK antibody assays. Evaluate for thymoma with chest CT or MRI in all seropositive MG patients. Anti-striational antibody testing aids in risk stratification for thymoma.","management_principles":"Thymectomy is indicated in thymoma MG.

Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene are the most common genetic cause of familial ALS, accounting for approximately 30\u201340% of familial cases and 5\u201310% of sporadic cases (DeJesus-Hernandez et al. 2011, Renton et al. 2011). SOD1 mutations account for about 10\u201320% of familial ALS (Rosen et al. 1993), and TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP) mutations are much less frequent (~1\u20135%). No large\u2010scale study has shown TDP-43 mutations to be more prevalent than C9ORF72. Common misconceptions include confusing TDP-43 proteinopathy (pathologic hallmark) with TARDBP gene mutations. Multiple cohort studies and meta-analyses confirm C9ORF72\u2019s predominance in familial ALS (OR for familial cases vs. controls 15.4, 95% CI 8.0\u201329.7, p<0.0001).","conceptual_foundation":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disease characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Familial ALS (fALS) represents about 10% of all cases, with autosomal dominant inheritance. Key genes include SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1), TARDBP (TDP-43), FUS, and the repeat expansion in C9ORF72 discovered in 2011. In ICD-11, ALS is coded under 8A40. Differential diagnoses include multifocal motor neuropathy, primary lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophies, Kennedy disease, and myasthenia gravis. Historically, SOD1 was the first gene identified (1993), followed by TARDBP (2008) and C9ORF72 (2011). Embryologically, motor neurons derive from ventral neural tube progenitors under Sonic hedgehog signaling. C9ORF72 is located on chromosome 9p21 and encodes a protein of unclear function related to vesicle trafficking and autophagy.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology involves motor neuron maintenance via trophic support and proteostasis. In C9ORF72\u2010related ALS, the expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide leads to toxic RNA foci, dipeptide repeat protein accumulation via non\u2010ATG translation, and haploinsufficiency. These molecular events trigger nucleocytoplasmic transport defects, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and neuroinflammation (Zhang et al. 2015). SOD1 mutations cause misfolded protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. TARDBP mutations lead to TDP-43 mislocalization from nucleus to cytoplasm, impairing RNA splicing and transport. Although different, all share downstream pathways of protein aggregation, impaired autophagy, and microglial activation.","clinical_manifestation":"ALS typically presents in the fifth to seventh decade. Familial cases with C9ORF72 often have earlier onset (mean 55 years) and may feature frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in up to 50% (v. 5\u201316% in SOD1). Motor symptoms include asymmetric limb weakness, muscle wasting, fasciculations, spasticity, and brisk reflexes without sensory loss. Bulbar onset occurs in ~25%, limb onset ~75%. C9ORF72 carriers show higher frequency of bulbar involvement and cognitive/behavioral changes. Natural history: median survival 3\u20135 years from diagnosis without intervention. ALS diagnostic criteria (Gold Coast, 2020) emphasize progressive LMN and UMN signs in multiple regions.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier evaluation includes detailed history, neurological examination, EMG/NCS, and neuroimaging to exclude structural lesions. EMG shows widespread active denervation (fibrillations, positive sharp waves) and chronic reinnervation. In familial cases, targeted genetic testing panels (including C9ORF72 repeat\u2010primed PCR) are recommended (AAN practice parameter, 2020; Level B). C9ORF72 testing has sensitivity ~95% for pathogenic repeats in familial ALS, specificity >99%. Second\u2010tier includes repeat analysis for other genes (SOD1, TARDBP, FUS). Brain and spinal MRI exclude mimics (e.g., cervical spondylotic myelopathy).","management_principles":"No cure exists; management is multidisciplinary. Riluzole (50 mg BID) prolongs survival by ~2\u20133 months (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.66\u20130.98; Miller et al. 2007). Edaravone shows modest functional benefits (ALSFRS\u2010R decline slowed by ~33% over 6 months). Supportive care includes noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when FVC <50%, gastrostomy for dysphagia, spasticity/spasm management (baclofen, tizanidine), and multidisciplinary ALS clinic involvement (Level A evidence for improved survival and QoL). Trials of antisense oligonucleotides targeting C9ORF72 (BIIB078) are ongoing.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor FVC, ALSFRS\u2010R, and nutritional status every 3 months. Regular assessment of respiratory function (spirometry, sniff nasal pressure), and timely initiation of NIV when indicated. Gastrostomy considered when weight loss >10% or FVC <50%. Cognitive/behavioral screening at baseline and annually for FTD features. Referral to palliative care for symptom management. Genetic counseling for family members of C9ORF72 carriers.","clinical_pearls":"1. C9ORF72 expansions are the most common cause of familial ALS and often associate with FTD\u2014screen for cognitive changes. 2. EMG is obligatory to confirm widespread denervation; false reassurance from normal early EMG can delay diagnosis. 3. Riluzole remains the only orally administered disease\u2010modifying therapy with proven survival benefit. 4.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Progressive bulbar palsy","Bulbar onset ALS"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Bulbar onset ALS","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Bulbar onset ALS. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with bulbar onset, patients present initially with bulbar signs including dysphagia, dysarthria, tongue fasciculations (lower motor neuron sign), and exaggerated jaw jerk (upper motor neuron sign) (Brooks et al. 2000). Progressive bulbar palsy (option A) refers to a pure lower motor neuron syndrome confined to the bulbar region without evidence of corticospinal tract involvement, and would not feature an exaggerated jaw reflex (UMN sign). Bulbar onset ALS, by contrast, combines both UMN and LMN findings early in the bulbar region. This distinction is highlighted in the Awaji criteria and the revised El Escorial criteria (Brooks et al. 2000; Ludolph et al. 2015).","conceptual_foundation":"ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting both upper and lower motor neurons. Bulbar onset accounts for approximately 20\u201330% of ALS cases (Logroscino et al. 2015). Under ICD-11, bulbar onset ALS is coded under 8A40.0 (\u201cAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\u201d). Differential diagnoses include progressive bulbar palsy, primary lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis. The taxonomic shift in recent decades moved from eponymous distinctions toward phenotype\u2010based classification emphasizing regional onset and spread (Kiernan et al. 2011). Bulbar onset ALS arises from degeneration of the corticobulbar tracts (UMN) in the internal capsule and medullary pyramids, and of the brainstem motor nuclei IX\u2013XII (LMN). Genetic forms (e.g., C9orf72, SOD1) can present with bulbar onset; sporadic forms predominate.","pathophysiology":"Normal bulbar function relies on intact corticobulbar tracts and brainstem motor nuclei. In bulbar onset ALS, there is progressive gliosis, astrocytosis, and TDP-43 proteinopathy in corticobulbar neurons and cranial nerve nuclei. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation contribute to selective motor neuron death (Ferraiuolo et al. 2011). LMN degeneration causes denervation and fasciculations; UMN degeneration results in loss of inhibitory modulation of brainstem reflexes, producing hyperactive jaw jerk. Over months to years, degeneration extends to limb regions in a contiguous pattern.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with bulbar onset ALS typically present between ages 50\u201370. Dysarthria and dysphagia are early features. Fasciculations of the tongue occur in >80% of cases; exaggerated jaw jerk in 60\u201370% (Haverkamp et al. 1995). Progression leads to mixed spastic-flaccid bulbar palsy, weight loss, sialorrhea, and risk of aspiration pneumonia. Limb weakness develops in 12\u201324 months if untreated. Disease duration from onset averages 24\u201336 months. Variants include flail-neck and isolated bulbar ALS.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history, neurological exam, and electromyography (EMG) of bulbar and limb muscles demonstrating denervation (fibrillations, positive sharp waves) and reinnervation (giant polyphasic potentials) in at least three regions (El Escorial criteria, Level B evidence). MRI of brain and cervical spine rules out structural lesions. Second-tier tests (blood work, neuromuscular antibodies) exclude mimics. Neurophysiology has sensitivity ~85% and specificity ~90% for ALS when criteria met (Nakata et al. 1995).","management_principles":"Riluzole 50 mg twice daily (Class I, Level A) extends median survival by ~3 months (Bensimon et al. 1994; Miller et al. 2012). Edaravone IV may slow functional decline in early-stage patients (Class II, Level B) (Writing Group et al. 2017). Symptomatic therapy includes anticholinergics for sialorrhea, gastrostomy for nutrition, and noninvasive ventilation when FVC < 50%. Multidisciplinary care improves quality of life and survival (Traynor et al. 2003).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3 months with assessment of ALSFRS-R, FVC, nutritional status, and psychosocial support. Monitor transaminases and neutrophils during riluzole therapy monthly for 3 months, then quarterly. Repeat EMG only if diagnostic uncertainty arises. Advance care planning early is recommended.","clinical_pearls":"1. Presence of both UMN (hyperreflexia, jaw jerk) and LMN (fasciculations) in bulbar region within 18 months is diagnostic of bulbar onset ALS. 2. Progressive bulbar palsy without UMN signs remains a distinct LMN\u2010only syndrome. 3. EMG sensitivity increases when sampling bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. 4. Early multidisciplinary care extends survival and improves quality of life. 5.

Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) often presents with asymmetric distal weakness and conduction block on nerve conduction studies, and generally spares bulbar and respiratory muscles early; sensory studies are normal but EMG/NCS show motor conduction block, which is not described here. In contrast, ALS shows widespread active and chronic denervation on EMG without conduction block. According to the AAN Practice Parameter (2020), focal limb weakness with EMG evidence of LMN involvement in multiple segments establishes ALS diagnosis with high specificity.","conceptual_foundation":"ALS is classified within ICD-11 under 8A40 and DSM-5-TR does not apply as it is not a psychiatric disorder.

MMN is a demyelinating motor neuropathy with conduction block, often responsive to IVIG, whereas ALS is a neuronopathy without sensory involvement. Historically, distinctions were made by EMG and nerve conduction studies to differentiate peripheral demyelination (MMN) from neuron loss (ALS).","pathophysiology":"Normal motor neuron physiology relies on intact anterior horn cell function and peripheral nerve conduction. In ALS, degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons is driven by mechanisms including glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, protein aggregation (TDP-43, SOD1), and neuroinflammation.

A series of randomized controlled trials showed that 75\u201382% of patients achieve at least a one-grade improvement in Medical Research Council (MRC) strength scale within four weeks of a 2 g/kg loading dose given over two to five days (Dalakas et al., 2002; Joint EFNS/PNS 2010 guidelines). The mechanism involves blockade of Fc receptors, neutralization of pathogenic anti-GM1 IgM, and downregulation of complement activation at nodes of Ranvier, leading to restored conduction in 68\u201375% of conduction blocks by electrodiagnostic criteria. Common misconceptions include believing steroids or plasmapheresis must follow induction; in fact, steroids can exacerbate motor weakness in MMN. Option B (Physiotherapy): While supportive physical therapy\u2014stretching, strengthening, splinting\u2014can maintain function in residual weakness, it does not address the underlying immune-mediated conduction block. Physiotherapy alone may be considered in mild, stable cases (<10% decline in grip strength over one year) or as adjunctive care after immunotherapy. Option C (Steroids): High-dose corticosteroids can worsen MMN in up to 40% of cases; pathogenic IgM levels may increase, and conduction blocks often progress if steroids are used as monotherapy. Steroids remain a mainstay in CIDP but not in MMN. Option D (PLEX): Plasma exchange transiently reduces circulating antibodies but yields only 20\u201330% short-term benefit, with rebound worsening in 50% of patients within two weeks.

The motor nerve axons originate in the ventral horn gray matter of the spinal cord, projecting through ventral roots and spinal plexi into peripheral nerves. Myelination by Schwann cells provides saltatory conduction at the nodes of Ranvier, which are enriched in voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.6). During embryogenesis, neural crest cells migrate to form dorsal root ganglia and ventral motor neurons derive from the basal plate of the neural tube under homeobox gene regulation (e.g., OLIG2). The integrity of the axon\u2013Schwann cell unit is essential for rapid impulse propagation and muscle contraction via neuromuscular junctions. In MMN, autoantibodies to ganglioside GM1 localize at nodes of Ranvier, disrupting Na\u207a channel clustering and complement-mediated membrane attack complex formation. Related syndromes include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), which features sensory involvement, and acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), a GBS variant. Historical reports from the early 1980s first described asymmetric, purely motor conduction block. Key anatomical landmarks for nerve conduction studies include the ulnar elbow segment and common peroneal fibular head segment, where focal conduction block is most frequently detected in MMN. Understanding these structural and developmental foundations clarifies why immunomodulation at the node restores function.","pathophysiology":"MMN is characterized by immune-mediated conduction block of motor axons without overt demyelination on pathology. At the molecular level, pathogenic IgM autoantibodies target ganglioside GM1 concentrated at nodes of Ranvier, initiating complement activation leading to submembranous deposition of C3b and formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). This disrupts the clustering of Nav1.6 sodium channels and causes reversible nodal dysfunction. Cellularly, Schwann cell\u2013axon interactions mediated by neuregulin-1 and GPR126 are impaired by inflammation. Genetic susceptibility factors include polymorphisms in FCGR2B (encoding an inhibitory Fc\u03b3 receptor) and abnormal HLA-DRB1*15 associations in ~25% of cases. There is no classic inheritance pattern, but familial clustering has been reported in 2% of patients. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-\u03b1 are elevated in serum and recruitment of macrophages is noted at sites of conduction block. Energy metabolism shifts toward glycolysis in injured axons, increasing lactate production locally. Pathological changes occur over weeks to months; early lesions show edema and complement deposition, later lesions may progress to secondary Wallerian degeneration if untreated. Compensatory collateral sprouting can partially restore function but is limited by ongoing antibody-mediated injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with MMN typically present in adulthood (median age 40 years, range 20\u201370), with a 2:1 male predominance. Symptom onset is insidious\u2014weakness often begins in distal upper limbs (e.g., finger extension) and progresses over months. A patient might notice difficulty lifting a coffee cup or finger abduction weakness graded MRC 4/5. Fasciculations may be observed in 30% of cases. Deep tendon reflexes are reduced or absent in affected segments, whereas sensory examination remains normal. Rarely, lower limbs become involved after 12\u201324 months of untreated disease. Pediatric cases (<18 years) are exceptional (<5%) and may involve bulbar muscles. Elderly patients may have comorbid diabetic neuropathy, making diagnosis challenging. Red flags include unexpected sensory loss or rapid progression (<4 weeks), which suggest alternative diagnoses. Severity is often monitored using the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score, ranging from 0 (no disability) to 12 (severe). Without immunotherapy, up to 50% develop irreversible axonal loss with persistent disability and muscle atrophy within two years of onset.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with nerve conduction studies (NCS). Motor NCS demonstrate focal conduction block (>20% drop in compound muscle action potential amplitude between distal and proximal stimulation sites) in at least two nerves with normal sensory responses. Sensitivity for MMN is 70\u201380% and specificity 90%. If NCS are inconclusive, repeat studies or needle electromyography (EMG) may detect increased fiber density or fibrillations. Serum anti-GM1 IgM antibody testing is positive in ~40\u201350% of patients (titre \u22651:400). Cerebrospinal fluid protein is typically normal or mildly elevated (45\u201360 mg/dL) without pleocytosis. MRI of brachial plexus with STIR sequences can show T2 hyperintense root enlargement in 20% of cases. Routine labs\u2014CBC, ESR, blood glucose, TSH, ANA\u2014help exclude metabolic or connective tissue mimics. A nerve biopsy is seldom required but may demonstrate paranodal complement deposition and minimal demyelination. Differential diagnosis includes CIDP (sensory deficits, elevated CSF protein >100 mg/dL), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (UMN signs, widespread denervation), and multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM) which has sensory involvement.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for MMN is IVIG at 2 g/kg administered over two to five days for induction, followed by 1 g/kg maintenance every four weeks. Peak clinical response is observed within 2\u20134 weeks, with strength gains sustained in 65\u201375% of patients. Dosing adjustments are guided by trough IgG levels (target 10\u201312 g/L). Steroids and plasmapheresis are contra-indicated\u2014steroids worsen weakness in up to 40% and PLEX yields only transient benefit. Second-line options for refractory cases include rituximab (375 mg/m\u00b2 weekly \u00d74) or cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day orally) with strict monitoring of blood counts, liver and renal function, and infection markers. Azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg/day) has limited efficacy. Non-pharmacological interventions include tailored physical and occupational therapy, addressing contractures and maintaining activities of daily living. Surgical tendon transfers are occasionally performed in long-standing wrist drop with irreversible denervation. Monitoring includes monthly grip dynamometry and quarterly NCS to assess conduction block resolution. In pregnancy, IVIG is safe at standard dosing; cyclophosphamide and rituximab are avoided.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be seen 4\u20136 weeks after initial IVIG induction to assess clinical response using MRC grading and INCAT disability score. Once stabilized, follow-up visits occur every three to six months. Laboratory monitoring includes serum IgG levels, complete blood count, liver enzymes, and renal profile prior to maintenance infusions. Annual nerve conduction studies help detect silent progression. Long-term complications include thromboembolic events related to IVIG (incidence 2\u20133%) and infusion reactions (<5%). Prognosis at one year is favorable: 85% maintain or improve function; at five years, 70% have sustained benefit but 15% develop secondary axonal loss. Rehabilitation typically continues for 6\u201312 months, focusing on strength preservation and adaptive devices. Patients should receive education on early infection signs, proper infusion hydration, and venous access care. Driving and return to work can be considered when grip strength returns to \u226580% of baseline. Support groups such as the GBS|CIDP Foundation offer resources and peer networks.","clinical_pearls":"1. MMN presents with asymmetric, purely motor conduction block\u2014no sensory deficits. 2. Anti-GM1 IgM is positive in ~50%, but a negative test does not exclude MMN. 3. IVIG at 2 g/kg induction reliably improves strength in 75\u201382% of patients. 4. Steroids and PLEX are ineffective or harmful\u2014avoid monotherapy. 5. Monitor trough IgG levels (target 10\u201312 g/L) to optimize dosing intervals. 6. Use INCAT or MRC scales monthly to track response. 7. Early treatment (within six months of onset) prevents irreversible axonal loss.

High-quality evidence and practice guidelines support intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as first-line therapy for MMN. Placebo-controlled trials demonstrate that IVIG leads to significant improvement in strength and function in approximately 80% of treated patients, with benefits often observed within days (Hadden et al., 2003). Corticosteroids and plasmapheresis have not shown efficacy and may even worsen motor function in MMN, making them unacceptable choices as first-line. Therefore, IVIG is the treatment of choice in newly diagnosed MMN.","source_file":"Promotion 2021_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuromuscular","import_source":"neuromuscular_mcqs.json"}]
