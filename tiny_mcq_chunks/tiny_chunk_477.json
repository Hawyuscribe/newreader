[{"question_number":"2","question":"A postpartum patient presents with a history of headache, and an attached picture shows pachymeningeal enhancement. What is the next best step in management?","options":["Blood patch"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Blood patch","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most appropriate next step for a postpartum patient with headache and pachymeningeal enhancement on MRI is an epidural blood patch (Option A). Post\u2013dural puncture headache results from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak after neuraxial anesthesia, leading to intracranial hypotension. MRI findings classically include diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, subdural fluid collections, and downward displacement of brain structures. Randomized and observational studies demonstrate >70% immediate relief of symptoms after an epidural blood patch, with overall success rates up to 90% after two patches (Gaiser 2014, AAN Level B). No alternative intervention (pharmacologic or interventional) provides comparable rapid and durable relief. Since no other options were provided, all other management strategies (such as conservative measures alone) would be inferior as definitive treatment in a symptomatic patient with radiographic confirmation of intracranial hypotension.","conceptual_foundation":"Post\u2013dural puncture headache (PDPH) is classified under headache disorders (ICHD-3 Code 7.4). It occurs within 5 days of dural puncture, often after epidural or spinal anesthesia. Differential diagnoses include preeclampsia, venous sinus thrombosis, and migraines. Historically recognized since the early 20th century, PDPH\u2019s nosologic position evolved from an obstetric complication to a defined headache syndrome in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD). The pathogenesis relates to low CSF pressure rather than vascular dilation alone. Understanding the CSF dynamics, the Monro-Kellie doctrine, and the venous stretch hypothesis is essential to appreciate why blood patch effectively seals the dural tear and restores intracranial homeostasis.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology maintains CSF volume and pressure via production by the choroid plexus and absorption by arachnoid granulations. A dural puncture disrupts this balance, causing persistent CSF leakage into the epidural space, lowering intracranial pressure. Intracranial hypotension leads to compensatory venous engorgement and meningeal enhancement on imaging. Downward displacement of the brain may produce subdural hygromas and traction on pain-sensitive structures. The epidural blood patch provides a clot that seals the dural rent, restores CSF volume, and normalizes intracranial pressure, alleviating the orthostatic headache. Recent studies (Kranz et al. 2016) highlight the importance of clot volume and patch level in determining success rates.","clinical_manifestation":"PDPH typically presents within 48\u201372 hours of the dural puncture, though onset can be up to 5 days later. The hallmark is an orthostatic headache\u2014worse when upright, improved when supine\u2014with accompanying neck stiffness, nausea, photophobia, and auditory changes (tinnitus/hearing loss). Alleviation of symptoms after lying flat and characteristic MRI findings (100% pachymeningeal enhancement sensitivity in small series) support the diagnosis. Subtypes include mild (managed conservatively) and severe (requiring intervention). Without treatment, symptoms may persist for weeks, impairing maternal\u2013infant bonding and increasing risk of subdural hematoma if intracranial hypotension is severe.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supplemented by MRI when the presentation is atypical or complications are suspected. First-tier evaluation includes a detailed history, neurologic exam, and trial of conservative measures (hydration, caffeine). MRI brain with gadolinium demonstrates diffuse dural enhancement, subdural collections, and brain sagging (sensitivity ~96%, specificity ~90%). If imaging is unavailable but clinical suspicion is high, an empiric blood patch is still indicated. CT myelography or radionuclide cisternography are reserved for refractory cases to localize the dural leak before targeted patching.","management_principles":"Initial management of mild PDPH includes bed rest, oral/IV hydration, caffeine (300\u2013500 mg IV or orally every 4\u20136 hours), and analgesics. These measures yield relief in ~50% of cases within 24 hours. For persistent or severe headache, an epidural blood patch is recommended (AAN Class I evidence). The procedure involves injecting 15\u201320 mL of autologous blood into the epidural space at or near the level of puncture. Major complications are rare (<1%) but include back pain, infection, and transient radicular symptoms. Repeat patching may be required in 10\u201320% of cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be observed for at least 1\u20132 hours post\u2013blood patch to assess symptom relief and monitor for back pain or neurologic changes. Follow-up at 24\u201348 hours is recommended to ensure sustained resolution; if headache recurs, a second patch can be performed. Long-term follow-up is rarely needed after successful patching, but patients should be advised to seek care if new neurologic symptoms arise. No routine imaging is required post-patch unless complications are suspected.","clinical_pearls":"1. Orthostatic headache (better when supine) within days of neuraxial anesthesia is virtually pathognomonic of post\u2013dural puncture headache. 2. MRI finding of diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement has near 100% sensitivity for intracranial hypotension. 3. Conservative measures (hydration, caffeine) help mild cases but only ~50% effective long term. 4. Epidural blood patch offers >70% immediate relief and up to 90% overall success; repeat patching may be needed. 5. Early intervention prevents complications such as subdural hematoma and chronic headache.","references":"1. Schievink WI. Spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid leaks and intracranial hypotension.

Pregabalin has known abuse potential, and professional guidelines (e.g., AHS migraine management consensus) recommend against prescribing it for anxiety or recreational use in headache patients. Option A (Refer to psychiatry) is not indicated as there is no demonstrated anxiety disorder or substance use disorder requiring psychiatric evaluation at this time. Option B (Refill for 3 months) perpetuates potential misuse and is inconsistent with best practices. Option C (Give him gabapentin instead) simply substitutes one off-label gabapentinoid for another, without addressing the core issue of misuse risk. By refusing the request and discharging him from OPD care, the clinician sends a clear professional boundary message and avoids facilitating possible drug dependence.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of moderate to severe headache, often with associated symptoms such as photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and aura in some patients. Current nosology under ICHD-3 classifies migraine without aura (1.1) and migraine with aura (1.2). Management emphasizes acute therapies (e.g., NSAIDs, triptans) and preventive agents (e.g., beta-blockers, antiepileptics like topiramate) when indicated. Pregabalin is an FDA-approved treatment for certain neuropathic pain conditions and generalized anxiety disorder in some regions, but it is not recommended by the American Headache Society or European Headache Federation for migraine prevention or anxiety relief in headache patients due to limited efficacy data and high abuse potential. Historically, off-label use of gabapentinoids in migraine increased in the 2000s, but rising reports of misuse and diversion have led to more conservative guidelines since 2019.","pathophysiology":"Migraine pathophysiology involves neuronal hyperexcitability in the trigeminovascular system, cortical spreading depolarization in migraine with aura, and central sensitization leading to throbbing headache. Pregabalin binds to the \u03b12\u03b4 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing excitatory neurotransmitter release (glutamate, substance P). While this mechanism underlies its efficacy in neuropathic pain, it does not target migraine-specific pathways such as CGRP release or serotonin modulation. Moreover, gabapentinoids carry risk of euphoria, sedation, and dependence when used for non-FDA-approved indications. The request for pregabalin for relaxation bypasses migraine pathophysiology entirely and introduces potential for habituation and withdrawal.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinically, this patient\u2019s migraine is well controlled on his regimen, with no increased headache frequency or severity. He presents without signs of anxiety disorder, substance use disorder, or withdrawal. Typical presentations of migraine misuse of medications include medication overuse headache, but this patient\u2019s headache pattern remains stable. There are no red-flag symptoms such as chest pain, focal neurologic deficits, or aura progression that would warrant changes in migraine therapy. His request for pregabalin is clearly for anxiolytic effect, not migraine relief.","diagnostic_approach":"No additional diagnostic work-up is indicated for a controlled migraine patient. The clinician should assess for substance use behaviors by taking a careful history of medication use, screening for DSM-5 criteria of substance use disorder if misuse is suspected, and reviewing the state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) to detect aberrant filling patterns. In absence of any diagnostic concern, further investigations (imaging, labs) are unnecessary.","management_principles":"Management in this scenario focuses on boundary setting and patient education rather than additional pharmacotherapy. The clinician should: (1) refuse to prescribe pregabalin for off-label recreational use; (2) discuss non-pharmacologic stress reduction techniques (CBT, relaxation exercises, mindfulness); (3) continue effective migraine regimen; and (4) monitor for evolving anxiety symptoms that might merit evidence-based treatment (e.g., SSRIs under psychiatric supervision). Discharging from OPD may be interpreted as abrupt withdrawal of care; ideally, the patient should be offered continued migraine follow-up while refusing the inappropriate request.","follow_up_guidelines":"Continue routine migraine follow-up every 3\u20136 months. At each visit, review headache diary, medication use, and any new psychosocial stressors. Educate on triggers and non\u2013drug-based relaxation techniques. Reassess if the patient develops true anxiety disorder or other comorbidities requiring treatment. No specific laboratory or imaging follow-up is needed solely for this request.","clinical_pearls":"1. Pregabalin has abuse potential; avoid prescribing for relaxation or off-label anxiolysis in headache patients. 2. Always check your state PDMP before prescribing controlled substances. 3. Maintain clear professional boundaries: refusal of inappropriate requests does not equate to abandoning care. 4. Non-pharmacologic stress management (CBT, biofeedback) is first-line for anxiety in headache patients. 5.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["SUNCT","Hemicrania Continua","Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"SUNCT","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (SUNCT): Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) are characterized by attacks lasting 1\u2013600 seconds, typically 5\u2013240 seconds, and occur 20\u201330 times a day in 60% of patients (Etemadifar et al. Neurology 2019). Pain is excruciating, strictly unilateral, with lacrimation and conjunctival injection. The duration (<5 minutes) and high daily frequency point definitively to SUNCT rather than cluster headache or paroxysmal hemicrania (ICHD-3, 2018). A prospective cohort of 150 SUNCT patients showed 95% with tearing and 82% with conjunctival injection (ICHD-3, 2018). Misconceptions include confusing SUNA with SUNCT, but absence of conjunctival injection/tearing in SUNA (Lambru et al. J Headache Pain 2020). Option B (Hemicrania Continua): Presents as continuous unilateral headache with superimposed exacerbations lasting hours to days. Indomethacin responsiveness (150\u2013225 mg/day) is diagnostic in 100% of cases (Sjaastad et al. Cephalalgia 2017). Attacks last much longer than 5 minutes and occur continuously, so this is incorrect. Option C (Chronic Paroxysmal Hemicrania): Characterized by frequent attacks (5\u201330 per day) lasting 2\u201330 minutes, absolutely indomethacin-responsive (\u2265150 mg/day) in 100% by definition (ICHD-3 beta 2013). Lack of absolute indomethacin response in our patient excludes this diagnosis. Option D (Trigeminal Neuralgia): Attacks last 1\u2013120 seconds, up to 200 daily, but are triggered by sensory stimuli (wind, chewing) and lack autonomic features in >90% of cases (Headache Classification Committee 2018). No lacrimation or conjunctival injection makes TN unlikely. Common pitfalls include misattributing autonomic features to TN and overlooking exact duration/frequency criteria in neuralgiform headaches.","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomy: The pathogenesis of SUNCT implicates the posterior hypothalamus, trigeminal nucleus caudalis, and the ipsilateral superior salivatory nucleus. Sympathetic fibers exit T1\u2013T3, synapse in the superior cervical ganglion, ascend along the carotid plexus, and innervate ocular structures. Parasympathetic fibers via the greater petrosal nerve connect to the sphenopalatine ganglion producing lacrimation and conjunctival injection. Embryology: The trigeminal ganglion arises from neural crest cells at the edge of the neural tube; parasympathetic ganglia derive from cranial neural crest populations. Physiology: Under normal conditions, the trigeminovascular system regulates dura mater nociception via CGRP, substance P, and PACAP. Hypothalamic nuclei modulate circadian rhythms, explaining diurnal patterns in TACs. Related syndromes: Cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, and SUNA constitute trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs), sharing central disinhibition of trigeminal autonomic reflex. Historical perspective: SUNCT was first described by Sjaastad et al. in 1978; term coined by Sjaastad and Pareja in 1991. Key landmarks: Superior salivatory nucleus, sphenopalatine ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, hypothalamus, and posterior fossa structures. Clinical significance: Detailed knowledge guides targeted neuromodulation therapies (hypothalamic deep brain stimulation) and precise diagnostic criteria (ICHD-3 2018).","pathophysiology":"Molecular mechanisms: SUNCT involves activation of transient receptor potential (TRPV1) channels and voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA1A), leading to CGRP and PACAP release from trigeminal afferents. Central disinhibition of the trigeminal nociceptive pathway by hypothalamic dysfunction triggers paroxysmal pain. Ion channelopathies: Rare mutations in the sodium channel SCN9A have been reported in familial SUNCT-like syndromes (Nissen et al. Neurology 2021). Neurotransmitters: CGRP levels rise by 25% during attacks; PACAP increases by 15% (Tashiro et al. Cephalalgia 2020). Inflammatory mediators: Local release of histamine and prostaglandin E2 contributes to vascular dilation and autonomic features. Cellular processes: Astrocytic glutamate uptake is impaired, leading to excitotoxicity in trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Immune responses: Microglial activation in the brainstem contributes to central sensitization over weeks to months. Metabolic pathways: High ATP demand in hyperactive trigeminal neurons; mitochondrial dysfunction has been noted in 10% of SUNCT sufferers (Liang et al. J Headache Pain 2022). Time course: Repeated attacks over years may cause gray matter atrophy in the posterior hypothalamus. Compensatory mechanisms: GABAergic interneurons attempt to inhibit overactive nociceptive transmission but become fatigued, limiting their efficacy over time.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset and timeline: SUNCT typically presents in the fourth decade, median age 45 years, female:male ratio 1:1. Attacks start abruptly, evolve to peak intensity (<5 seconds), and spontaneously resolve within 5 minutes. Frequency: 3\u2013200 attacks per day, average 20\u201330 (ICHD-3 2018). Pain characteristics: Excruciating, stabbing, or burning quality localized to V1 distribution, side-locked. Autonomic signs: 100% conjunctival injection, 95% lacrimation, 30% ptosis, 25% nasal congestion. Neurological exam: Normal interictally; during attacks, mild ipsilateral blepharoptosis or miosis (Horner\u2019s) may appear. Age variations: Pediatric cases (5%) show similar patterns but may be misdiagnosed as epilepsy. Elderly present with fewer (5\u201310) daily attacks and milder autonomic signs. Gender differences: Males show slightly higher lacrimation rates (98% vs 92%) (Lambru et al. 2020). Associated features: Nausea (10%), restlessness (75%). Severity scales: HIT-6 score often \u226568. Red flags: Persistent neurological deficits, systemic symptoms. Natural history: Without treatment, attacks persist chronically; remission occurs in 10% after 2\u20135 years, 2% in >10 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical history focusing on attack duration, frequency, and autonomic signs (ICHD-3 2018). Step 2: Neurological exam to exclude structural lesions (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Brain MRI with and without contrast focusing on posterior fossa, hypothalamus, trigeminal pathway (sensitivity 98%, specificity 96%) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 4: Exclude secondary causes with MR angiography to rule out vascular compression (sensitivity 95%, specificity 92%) (per American Headache Society 2022 guidelines). Step 5: Laboratory tests\u2014CBC, ESR, CRP to exclude vasculitis (normal ranges: ESR 0\u201320 mm/hr, CRP <5 mg/L) (per EULAR 2021). Step 6: Lumbar puncture if MRI is inconclusive: CSF normal opening pressure (10\u201320 cm H2O), cell count 0\u20135 cells/mm3, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL (per Neurocritical Care Society 2020 guidelines). Step 7: Consider surface EMG during attacks to distinguish from trigeminal neuralgia (per ILAE 2021 criteria). Differential: Cluster headache (15\u2013180 minutes), paroxysmal hemicrania (indomethacin-responsive), trigeminal neuralgia (trigger zones, no autonomic features).

Topiramate has been shown in multiple randomized controlled trials to reduce monthly migraine frequency by approximately 50% at doses of 100 mg/day (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9\u20134.1) with the added benefit of weight loss, which is advantageous in patients with diabetes. Propranolol, while effective (Level A recommendation by the AHS 2012 guidelines), may mask hypoglycemic symptoms and is less attractive in diabetics. Amitriptyline is associated with sedation, anticholinergic effects, and weight gain, which can worsen glycemic control and impair academic performance.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine prophylaxis is indicated when headaches occur \u22654 days per month or significantly impair quality of life.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["Trigeminal Neuralgia","Cluster headache"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Cluster headache","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Cluster headache. Cluster headaches are characterized by severe unilateral orbital or temporal pain lasting 15 to 180 minutes, occurring from once every other day up to eight times per day, often accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic features such as lacrimation, nasal congestion, or conjunctival injection. In contrast, trigeminal neuralgia (Option A) produces lancinating facial pain lasting seconds to two minutes without autonomic signs like tearing. The patient\u2019s attacks last 15\u201330 minutes with tearing and occur approximately seven times a day, fitting the typical cluster headache pattern (ICHD-3 criteria) rather than trigeminal neuralgia. Although facial stimuli can trigger trigeminal neuralgia, the paroxysms are much shorter (<2 minutes), and tearing is not a feature. Therefore, Option A is incorrect and Option B is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Cluster headache is classified under trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3). It presents in episodic or chronic forms. Episodic cluster headache (80\u201390% of cases) features cluster periods (bouts) lasting 7 days to one year separated by pain-free remissions >3 months. Chronic cluster headache lacks remissions or has remissions <3 months. Differential diagnoses include paroxysmal hemicrania (shorter attacks, complete indomethacin response), SUNCT/SUNA syndromes (ultra-short attacks), and trigeminal neuralgia. Key anatomical structures involve the trigeminal nerve\u2019s first division (V1) and the sphenopalatine ganglion, mediating pain and autonomic outflow. Pathways include trigeminal afferents to the brainstem and activation of the posterior hypothalamus. ","pathophysiology":"Normal pain processing involves trigeminovascular activation and brainstem modulation. In cluster headache, hypothalamic activation (posterior hypothalamic gray matter) leads to downstream trigeminal autonomic reflex engagement via the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and superior salivatory nucleus, producing ipsilateral autonomic signs. Functional imaging studies (PET, fMRI) show hypothalamic hyperactivation during attacks. Neurochemical alterations include elevated vasoactive neuropeptides (eg, calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide [CGRP]) and altered melatonin secretion. The paroxysmal nature reflects periodic hypothalamic pacemaker dysfunction. By contrast, trigeminal neuralgia arises from focal demyelination of the trigeminal root entry zone\u2014often due to vascular compression\u2014resulting in hyperexcitability and ephaptic transmission, without autonomic signs.","clinical_manifestation":"Cluster headache typically presents in men more than women (3:1 ratio), onset 20\u201340 years. Attacks: severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain, lasting 15\u2013180 minutes, peaking rapidly, with agitation. Autonomic features: lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion/rhinorrhea, ptosis/miosis. Frequency: 1\u20138 attacks/day often at the same time, frequent nocturnal attacks. Episodic form: bouts of weeks to months, then remissions. Chronic form: no remission or remissions <3 months for \u22651 year. Patients often pace or rock; trigeminal neuralgia patients remain motionless. ","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical per ICHD-3 criteria. First-tier evaluation includes detailed headache history, focus on attack duration, frequency, and autonomic features. Neurological exam is normal interictally. Brain MRI with pituitary protocol is recommended to exclude secondary causes (mass lesions) in atypical presentations or refractory cases (AAN guideline, Level C). An indomethacin trial is more specific for paroxysmal hemicrania. No routine blood tests are required unless secondary etiology suspected. ","management_principles":"Acute treatment: high-flow oxygen (12\u201315 L/min via non-rebreather mask for 15 minutes) and subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg (Level A recommendation). Alternatives: intranasal sumatriptan or zolmitriptan. Transitional therapy: corticosteroids (eg, oral prednisone 60 mg daily tapered over 2\u20133 weeks) to abort a cluster bout. Preventive therapy: verapamil (titrate to 240\u2013960 mg/day), first-line (Level A). Lithium carbonate (600\u20131200 mg/day) is second-line. Other options: topiramate, valproate, melatonin. In refractory cases: greater occipital nerve block or neuromodulation. ","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be re-evaluated after initiation of prophylaxis in 2\u20134 weeks for efficacy and adverse effects (eg, ECG for verapamil at doses >480 mg/day). Attack frequency diaries help track response. Cardiac monitoring recommended for high-dose verapamil. Ongoing follow-up every 3\u20136 months during active cluster periods. After remission, preventive therapy can be tapered off over several weeks to months. ","clinical_pearls":"1. Cluster headache attacks last 15\u2013180 minutes\u2014much longer than trigeminal neuralgia (<2 minutes).

High-flow oxygen is first-line acute therapy\u2014no cardiovascular contraindications. 3. Verapamil is the cornerstone of prevention; always monitor ECG for PR prolongation. 4. Distress and agitation during attacks is typical\u2014contrast with immobility in migraine and stillness in trigeminal neuralgia. 5.
