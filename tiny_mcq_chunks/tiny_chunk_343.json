What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["MELAS","CADASIL ## Page 5"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"MELAS","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A MELAS. MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) commonly presents in late childhood or early adulthood with recurrent stroke-like events that do not conform to vascular territories, sensorineural hearing loss, dysarthria, and cognitive impairment or learning difficulties. MRI classically shows cortical and subcortical lesions in parietal and occipital lobes that cross arterial boundaries (Yatsuga et al. 2018). In contrast, option B CADASIL is a NOTCH3-related arteriopathy presenting in mid-adulthood with migraine, subcortical infarcts, cognitive decline, and characteristic anterior temporal lobe white matter hyperintensities on MRI without sensorineural hearing loss or lactic acidosis. CADASIL patients lack ragged-red fibers on muscle biopsy and do not exhibit elevated lactate levels. Thus, the clinical triad of stroke-like episodes, lactic acidosis, and hearing loss in a young patient with learning difficulties is pathognomonic for MELAS, making CADASIL incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"MELAS is classified in ICD-11 under rare mitochondrial metabolic disorders (QE50). It is a primary mitochondrial cytopathy inherited maternally due to pathogenic variants in mitochondrial DNA, most frequently the MTTL1 A3243G mutation. Related mitochondrial syndromes include MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers) and Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome, distinguished by their specific genetic defects and clinical features. Historically, MELAS was first delineated by Pavlakis et al. in 1984 as a unique clinical entity. Embryologically, mitochondria are maternally inherited organelles essential for oxidative phosphorylation. Neuroanatomically, cortical and subcortical regions with high energy demands\u2014especially parieto-occipital cortex and cochlear hair cells\u2014are preferentially affected. Heteroplasmy and threshold effects result in variable phenotypic expression, with some family members severely affected and others asymptomatic carriers.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I\u2013IV generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. In MELAS, defective tRNA leucine impairs mitochondrial protein synthesis, particularly subunits of complexes I and IV, leading to reduced ATP production, increased reactive oxygen species, and lactic acid accumulation. Stroke-like episodes arise from mitochondrial angiopathy and nitric oxide deficiency in small cerebral vessels, causing transient energy failure, astrocytic swelling, and neuronal excitotoxicity. The resulting lesions cross vascular territories and demonstrate cytotoxic and vasogenic edema on MRI. Accumulated lactic acid exacerbates neuronal injury and contributes to multisystem manifestations, including myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and endocrine dysfunction.","clinical_manifestation":"MELAS typically presents before age 40, often in the late teens or early twenties. Stroke-like episodes manifest as acute hemiparesis, cortical blindness, aphasia, or dysarthria that do not match vascular territories and may recur. Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in over 60 of patients by the third decade. Learning difficulties, developmental delay, and cognitive decline are common early features. Other manifestations include seizures (35  of patients), lactic acidosis (resting lactate >2 mmol/L in 80 ), cardiomyopathy, and short stature. Natural history involves progressive neurological decline with cumulative deficits after each stroke-like event. Japanese diagnostic criteria (2006) require a combination of clinical features, imaging findings, biochemical markers, and genetic confirmation, with reported sensitivity of 85 and specificity of 95.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes serum and CSF lactate and pyruvate measurement (sensitivity ~80 , specificity ~90 ) and brain MRI to detect stroke-like lesions. Second-tier testing involves molecular analysis for the A3243G mtDNA mutation in blood, though heteroplasmy may be low; muscle biopsy for ragged-red fibers and cytochrome c oxidase\u2013negative fibers offers sensitivity of 70 and specificity of 85. Third-tier investigations include full mtDNA genome sequencing and spectrophotometric respiratory chain enzyme assays on muscle tissue. Pretest probability is high in patients with the triad of stroke-like episodes, lactic acidosis, and hearing loss. Genetic counseling and maternal testing are essential for family planning.","management_principles":"No curative therapy exists; management is supportive and aimed at reducing stroke-like episodes. Intravenous L-arginine (0.5 g/kg over one hour) administered at onset of an episode may improve outcomes (Japanese guidelines 2012 Class IIa, Level C). Chronic supplementation with coenzyme Q10 (10\u201330 mg/kg/day), L-carnitine (50\u2013100 mg/kg/day), and B vitamins may enhance residual mitochondrial function (level C evidence). Seizures should be treated with non\u2013hepatic metabolism agents such as levetiracetam or lamotrigine to avoid valproate\u2019s mitochondrial toxicity. Hearing loss can be managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants. Cardiac surveillance for cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias is recommended, with ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers as needed. Multidisciplinary care and genetic counseling are paramount.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require neurological evaluations every 6 months to monitor new stroke-like events, seizures, and cognitive decline. Serum lactate and pyruvate should be measured annually or with symptom exacerbation. Audiological assessments are recommended yearly. Cardiac evaluation with ECG and echocardiogram should occur annually to detect cardiomyopathy or conduction defects. Endocrine screening for diabetes and thyroid dysfunction is advised annually. Rehabilitation specialists should assess motor and functional status biannually. Family members should undergo genetic counseling and, if desired, prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis.","clinical_pearls":"1 Stroke-like episodes in MELAS cross vascular territories, differentiating them from ischemic strokes. 2 The MTTL1 A3243G mutation accounts for over 80 of MELAS cases. 3 Early intravenous L-arginine may mitigate stroke-like episode severity if given within six hours of onset. 4 Avoid valproate in MELAS due to risk of hepatic failure; use levetiracetam for seizure control. 5 Heteroplasmy leads to variable expressivity; even asymptomatic maternal carriers may transmit the mutation.","references":"1 Parikh S Goldstein A Koenig MK et al Diagnosis and management of mitochondrial disease a consensus statement Genet Med 2015 17 9 689 701 doi101038gim2015108 2 Gorman GS Chinnery PF DiMauro S et al Mitochondrial disease Lancet 2016 388 10061 70 82 doi101016S0140673616005236 3 Mancuso M Filosto M Lo Gerfo A et al MELAS syndrome an overview of molecular mechanisms and clinical presentation Orphanet J Rare Dis 2014 9 149 doi1011861750-1172-9-149 4 McFarland R Taylor RW Turnbull DM Mitochondrial disease J Intern Med 2010 268 6 578 593 doi101111/j1365-27962010.02294.x 5 Yatsuga S Povalko N Nishioka J Clinical features and natural history of MELAS J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2018 89 7 810 817 doi101136/jnnp-2017-317264 6 Pavlakis SG Phillips PC DiMauro S et al Mitochondrial myopathy encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes a distinctive clinical entity Ann Neurol 1984 16 4 481 488 doi101002/ana.410160408 7 DiMauro S Schon EA Mitochondrial DNA mutations in human disease Am J Med Genet 2001 106 1 18 26 doi101002/ajmg10019 8 Schaefer AM McFarland R Blakely EL et al Prevalence of mitochondrial DNA disease in adults Ann Neurol 2008 63 1 35 39 doi101002/ana20739 9 Koenig MK Genetic counseling and testing for mitochondrial disease J Genet Couns 2016 25 3 533 542 doi101007/s10897-016-9958-5 10 Finsterer J Therapeutic approaches to mitochondrial disorders J Neurol Sci 2020 410 116556 doi101016/jjns202006980 11 Pfeffer G Majamaa K Turnbull DM Treatment for mitochondrial disorders Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2012 4 CD004426 12 Koga Y Akita Y Nishioka J Clinical features and outcome in MELAS Neurology 1997 48 7 786 790 doi101161/WNL-4870786 13 Goto Y Nonaka I Horai S A mutation in the tRNALeu UUR gene associated with the MELAS subgroup Ann Neurol 1990 28 1 114 120 doi101002/ana.410280118 14 Murphy JL Arthur AM Regional variation in heteroplasmy impacts phenotypic expression of MELAS J Inherit Metab Dis 2018 41 4 365 378 doi101007/s10545-018-0163-5 15 Swerdlow RH Biochemical treatment of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies J Child Neurol 2012 27 9 1158 1162 doi101177/0883073812452692"},"ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2023","exam_type":"Part One","source_file":"Part I 2023_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuromuscular","import_source":"neuromuscular_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"5","question":"In a scenario involving a female patient with ocular myasthenia gravis, what is the best sensitive test to confirm the diagnosis?","options":["Single fiber EMG","AChR antibody","Anti-striated muscle antibody ## Page 16"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Single fiber EMG","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Single fiber EMG (SFEMG) is the most sensitive diagnostic test for ocular myasthenia gravis, with sensitivity of 90\u201395% in ocular-only presentations and up to 99% when combined with limb testing. It measures neuromuscular jitter and blocking in frontalis or orbicularis oculi muscles, detecting transmission failures of as little as 10 \u00b5s. SFEMG\u2019s high sensitivity makes it definitive in patients with negative antibody assays but clinical ptosis or diplopia. Common misconceptions include overreliance on antibody titers or edrophonium testing, but SFEMG outperforms them in pure ocular forms. Option B: Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody testing has 50\u201370% sensitivity in ocular myasthenia gravis and is positive in 85\u201390% of generalized cases. In patients with concurrent thymoma or systemic symptoms, AChR-Ab may be helpful, but a negative result does not exclude ocular-only disease. Option C: Anti-striated muscle antibodies are markers for thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis but have only 20\u201330% sensitivity overall and do not correlate with pure ocular involvement. They may be considered if thymoma is suspected on imaging but cannot confirm neuromuscular transmission defects. Option D: Edrophonium (Tensilon) test historically had 70% sensitivity and false positives in cholinesterase inhibitor use. It carries bradyarrhythmia risk and has largely been abandoned. In summary, SFEMG is the definitive sensitive test for ocular MG.","conceptual_foundation":"The neuromuscular junction involves axon terminals of lower motor neurons synapsing onto motor endplates of striated muscle fibers. For ocular muscles, the oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), and abducens (VI) cranial nerve nuclei in the midbrain and pons send myelinated fibers that release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Embryologically, extraocular muscles derive from preotic somitomeres and exhibit distinct fiber composition, including high-density innervation and faster fatigue rates. Normal physiology relies on acetylcholine vesicular release, diffusion across a 50 nm synaptic cleft, and binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) composed of \u03b11, \u03b21, \u03b4, and \u03b5 subunits. This triggers sodium influx and endplate potentials initiating muscle contraction. Ocular myasthenia gravis selectively impairs cranial nerve-innervated muscles, leading to variable ptosis and diplopia. Related conditions include Lambert-Eaton syndrome affecting presynaptic calcium channels and congenital myasthenic syndromes with genetic receptor subunit mutations. Historically, Erb first described fatigable ocular weakness in 1879, while Simpson characterized complementary edrophonium testing in the 1960s. Recognition of antibody-mediated receptor loss and the advent of electrophysiological techniques transformed diagnostic accuracy. Key landmarks include the neuromuscular junction\u2019s synaptic gutter and the T-tubule system for excitation\u2013contraction coupling, both clinically significant in neuromuscular transmission disorders.","pathophysiology":"In ocular myasthenia gravis, autoantibodies target post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the motor endplate. Binding induces receptor internalization and complement-mediated membrane damage, reducing receptor density by up to 70% within weeks. Key molecular players include complement component C5b-9 and cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 driving local inflammation. Ion channel function is impaired, decreasing endplate potential amplitude below threshold for muscle fiber action potentials. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DR3 and CTLA4 polymorphisms, conferring risk via altered T-cell regulation. Rare congenital forms result from mutations in genes encoding AChR subunits (CHRNE, CHRNA1) or rapsyn (RAPSN), but these present in infancy. In acquired ocular MG, autoreactive B cells and plasmablasts produce AChR-IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses that fix complement. Energy requirements escalate in fatigued extraocular muscles, overwhelming metabolic pathways and leading to intracellular calcium overload. Over days to months, compensatory sprouting of nerve terminals occurs, but with inefficient receptor clustering. Chronic receptor loss exceeds regenerative capacity, establishing persistent fatigability. Without treatment, synaptic structural damage accumulates over months, limiting recovery and predisposing to generalization in 50% of cases within two years.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with ocular myasthenia gravis typically present in their fourth to sixth decades, though bimodal distribution includes pediatric onset. Symptoms begin insidiously with unilateral or bilateral ptosis, often fluctuating diurnally and worsening with sustained upward gaze. Diplopia emerges when extraocular muscle fatigue reduces conjugate movement. On examination, ice-pack testing transiently improves ptosis by cold inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Cogan\u2019s lid twitch and variable pupillary sparing help distinguish from cranial nerve palsies. Muscle strength testing reveals fatigability, with decrement on repetitive nerve stimulation of orbicularis oculi. Pediatric patients may have higher seronegative rates, while elderly show greater risk of systemic progression. Associated systemic signs such as dysarthria or dysphagia are absent in purely ocular MG. Severity is graded per MGFA Ocular Class (Class I) before generalization. Red flags include rapid respiratory involvement or bulbar weakness, indicating crisis risk. Without treatment, ocular symptoms may persist or progress to generalized MG in 30\u201350% within two years. The natural history varies: around 20% achieve spontaneous remission, while others develop chronic fluctuating courses requiring long-term therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on fatigable ptosis and diplopia. Perform ice-pack test as bedside screen (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%) (per AAN 2023 Practice Parameter). Step 2: Order serum AChR antibody levels (sensitivity 50\u201370% in ocular MG; specificity ~99%) (per International MG Consensus Group 2016). If positive, confirm diagnosis and proceed to imaging. Step 3: If AChR-Ab negative, order single fiber EMG of orbicularis oculi or frontalis (sensitivity 90\u201395%) (per AAN 2023 Practice Parameter). Jitter >55 \u00b5s or blocking in >10% of fibers is diagnostic. Step 4: Repetitive nerve stimulation of facial muscles at 2\u20133 Hz; a decrement >10% supports MG (per AAN 2023 Practice Parameter). Step 5: Chest imaging with CT or MRI to evaluate thymus, using contrast-enhanced axial 3 mm slices (per International MG Consensus Group 2016). Exclude thymoma in 10\u201320% of ocular MG.

Multiple studies (e.g., Rajabally and Uncini 2012) have demonstrated that F-wave latency prolongation can be detected before significant conduction block or temporal dispersion appear. Option B (conduction block) and C (temporal dispersion) typically manifest later as demyelination becomes more pronounced in distal segments. Option D (reduced CMAP amplitude) reflects axonal loss or severe conduction block and is not the first change in a primarily demyelinating process.","conceptual_foundation":"AIDP, the most common variant of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, is characterized by immune-mediated demyelination of peripheral nerves. Under ICD-11 it is coded as 8A81. In the differential one considers other GBS variants (e.g., AMAN) and chronic demyelinating neuropathies. Early proximal demyelination delays F waves because F-waves represent antidromic activation of motor neurons via proximal segments. The roots involved have rich blood\u2013nerve barriers that become permeable during inflammation, allowing antibody-mediated attack. Developmentally, peripheral nerve myelination begins in utero, and interruption of Schwann cell function causes conduction slowing first in proximal segments.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, F waves travel antidromically from the muscle to the anterior horn cell and back orthodromically. In AIDP, macrophage and complement-mediated stripping of Schwann cell myelin sheaths at the node and paranode increases capacitance and decreases membrane resistance, leading to conduction slowing. Proximal roots are most vulnerable because of high blood\u2013nerve barrier permeability. Early in the disease, focal demyelination at these sites impairs F-wave generation before distal conduction parameters change significantly. Over time, demyelination spreads distally, causing conduction block, temporal dispersion, and eventual CMAP amplitude reduction.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with AIDP present subacutely over days to weeks with symmetric ascending weakness, areflexia, and variable sensory symptoms. F-wave changes correlate with onset of proximal weakness and may precede distal deficits. Sensory loss is often mild. Autonomic dysfunction may be present. A natural history untreated shows nadir by 4 weeks; about 20% require ventilatory support. Early electrophysiological detection via F-waves can guide prompt therapy initiation.","diagnostic_approach":"Electrodiagnostic studies are tiered: first assess distal CMAP and SNAP conduction velocities. If normal but clinical suspicion is high, assess F-waves and H-reflexes. Early in AIDP, only F-waves are abnormal (prolonged latency or absent response). Conduction block and temporal dispersion emerge as demyelination progresses. CSF shows albuminocytologic dissociation after 1 week; early CSF may be normal. MRI of roots with gadolinium may demonstrate nerve root enhancement and support diagnosis in ambiguous cases.","management_principles":"First-line treatment for AIDP includes IV immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days) or plasma exchange (4\u20136 sessions). Early initiation after electrophysiological confirmation reduces need for ventilation and accelerates recovery. Corticosteroids are not effective. Supportive care includes monitoring for autonomic instability, DVT prophylaxis, and physical therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require monitoring of vital capacity and autonomic parameters every 4\u20136 hours during the acute phase. Repeat NCS at 2\u20134 weeks may show evolving demyelination patterns. Long-term follow-up includes rehabilitation assessment, electrodiagnostic re-evaluation at 6 months for residual conduction slowing, and monitoring for treatment-related complications (e.g., IVIG-associated headache or renal dysfunction).","clinical_pearls":"1. F-wave absence or prolongation is the earliest NCS sign in AIDP. 2. Albuminocytologic dissociation in CSF may be absent in week one. 3. IVIG and plasma exchange are equally effective first-line therapies. 4. Corticosteroids do not improve outcome in AIDP. 5. Autonomic dysfunction can precede weakness nadir.","references":"1.

Option A (AIDP) has an acute monophasic course under 4 weeks. Option C (multifocal motor neuropathy) presents with purely motor, asymmetric, distal weakness without sensory involvement and characteristic conduction block of motor nerves only. Option D (ALS) is a motor neuron disease without sensory deficits and shows normal sensory NCS and persistent fibrillations on EMG.","conceptual_foundation":"CIDP is classified in ICD-11 as 8A81.1 and under the peripheral nerve disorders in neuromuscular taxonomy. It differs from AIDP (acute onset), MMN (pure motor, conduction block in motor fibers only, anti-GM1 antibodies), and ALS (upper and lower motor neuron signs without demyelination). CIDP\u2019s pathologic hallmark is macrophage-mediated segmental demyelination of peripheral nerves and nerve roots. Childhood variants and multifocal sensory ataxic forms are recognized. Understanding the time course (>8 weeks) is critical to differentiate from acute variants.","pathophysiology":"Normal nerve conduction depends on intact myelin sheaths and saltatory conduction. In CIDP, an aberrant immune response targets peripheral myelin, leading to segmental demyelination, conduction slowing, temporal dispersion, and eventual secondary axonal loss. Cellular immunity (T-cells, macrophages) and humoral factors (antibodies against myelin proteins) both play roles. Chronicity is maintained by ongoing immune activation within endoneurium and nerve roots, causing repeating cycles of demyelination and incomplete remyelination.","clinical_manifestation":"CIDP presents insidiously over months with symmetric proximal and distal weakness, areflexia, and sensory ataxia. Pain and fatigue are common. Subtypes include typical CIDP, multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), and distal CIDP. Natural history without treatment leads to progressive disability, risk of permanent deficits, and reduced quality of life.","diagnostic_approach":"Electrodiagnosis shows demyelinating features (prolonged distal latencies, slowed conduction velocities, conduction block, temporal dispersion) in at least two motor nerves. CSF albuminocytologic dissociation supports the diagnosis. Nerve imaging (ultrasound or MRI) may show nerve root enlargement. Biopsy is rarely required. EFNS/PNS 2010 criteria provide detailed electrodiagnostic thresholds.","management_principles":"First-line treatment includes corticosteroids, IVIG, or plasma exchange. IVIG (1 g/kg \u00d72 days or 0.4 g/kg \u00d75 days) is often preferred for rapid improvement. Steroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg daily) are effective but carry long-term side effects. Plasma exchange (5 sessions over 2 weeks) is equally efficacious. Maintenance therapy may involve IVIG every 3\u20136 weeks or immunosuppressants (azathioprine, rituximab) for refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular assessment using the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score every 4\u20138 weeks guides therapy adjustments. NCS may be repeated every 6\u201312 months to document remyelination or progression. Long-term monitoring includes bone density in steroid-treated patients, IVIG-related infusion reactions, and treatment-related immunosuppression complications.","clinical_pearls":"1. Time course >8 weeks distinguishes CIDP from GBS. 2. Multifocal conduction block in both motor and sensory nerves is typical. 3. First-line therapies include steroids, IVIG, plasma exchange. 4. Regular INCAT scoring guides treatment intervals. 5. Early treatment prevents axonal loss and disability.","references":"1. Doneddu PE, et al. EFNS/PNS guideline on diagnosis and treatment of CIDP.
