Per EFNS guidelines, MRI with contrast is recommended to exclude secondary causes such as multiple sclerosis or tumors (Cruccu et al., Eur J Neurol 2008). CT with contrast lacks the soft tissue resolution needed for posterior fossa imaging, and observation alone risks missing serious pathology.","conceptual_foundation":"TN is classified in the International Headache Society as neuropathic facial pain. Differential diagnoses include cluster headache, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and dental pathology. Pathways involve demyelination of trigeminal afferents in the root entry zone. Secondary TN arises from vascular compression, demyelinating lesions, or neoplasms.","pathophysiology":"Classic TN involves vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve at the root entry zone, leading to focal demyelination and ectopic impulse generation. In secondary TN, MS plaques or tumors produce similar demyelination. Injection of contrast in MRI highlights enhancing lesions and MS plaques, guiding management.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients report brief (<2 seconds), electric shock-like pains in the V2/V3 distribution, often triggered by light touch or chewing.

Atypical TN includes constant background pain in addition to paroxysms.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line imaging is MRI with contrast of the brain and brainstem with high-resolution sequences (3D-CISS). Sensitivity for identifying neurovascular compression is >95%. CT is insufficient to exclude MS lesions. Observation without imaging misses treatable causes in up to 15% of cases.","management_principles":"Initial therapy is carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, per AAN guidelines (Class I). In secondary TN, treating the underlying cause is paramount. Microvascular decompression is offered for refractory cases of classic TN with demonstrable vascular compression on MRI.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes assessment of pain control and medication side effects every 4\u20136 weeks initially. Repeat MRI if new neurological deficits emerge. Long-term management may require dose adjustments and monitoring of blood counts and hepatic function.","clinical_pearls":"1. MRI is mandatory in all new TN cases to exclude secondary causes. 2. Carbamazepine efficacy confirms TN diagnosis. 3. Bilateral TN should prompt MS workup. 4. Avoid trigeminal nerve block before imaging. 5. Typical pain triggers include washing face, shaving, or wind exposure.","references":"1. Cruccu G, et al.

Epidemiological studies show 2%\u201312% of pituitary adenomas present apoplexy. CT and MRI reveal hyperdense sellar mass with hemorrhage in over 80% of cases. Urgent endocrine society guidelines recommend high-dose corticosteroids within 24 hours and neurosurgical evaluation within 72 hours.   Option B: Migraine headache often presents with unilateral pulsatile pain, photophobia, phonophobia, and aura over hours. It lacks acute visual field defects and pituitary hemorrhage on imaging. In a classic migraine, pain builds over 1\u20132 hours and resolves in 4\u201372 hours. Studies show migraine prevalence of approximately 18% in women under 45 but no CT hyperdensity in the sella.   Option C: Tension-type headache causes bilateral, pressing, nonpulsatile discomfort without focal neurological deficits. Imaging is normal; there is no acute drop in cortisol or pituitary hormone levels. Lifetime prevalence exceeds 70%, but it never produces acute ophthalmoplegia or hormonal crisis.   Option D: Cluster headache features intense unilateral orbital pain lasting 15\u2013180 minutes with autonomic signs such as lacrimation. It recurs daily for weeks. No radiographic hemorrhage or endocrine abnormalities appear, and acute hormone deficiencies are absent. Common pitfalls include mistaking visual pain for partial ocular motor palsy, but CT/MRI rules this out.","conceptual_foundation":"The pituitary gland resides in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone. It consists of the anterior adenohypophysis (derivative of Rathke\u2019s pouch) and the posterior neurohypophysis (neuroectodermal origin). The superior hypophyseal arteries form a primary capillary plexus in the median eminence, feeding long portal veins to the anterior lobe. Embryologically, the adenohypophysis arises from surface ectoderm at approximately week four, and the neurohypophysis from a ventral extension of the diencephalon. Under normal physiology, corticotrophs secrete ACTH in a circadian rhythm regulated by the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis. Physiological regulation involves negative feedback via cortisol binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary. Key landmarks include the optic chiasm superiorly, cavernous sinuses laterally, and sphenoid sinus inferiorly. Syndromes related include Sheehan\u2019s syndrome, Empty sella, Nelson\u2019s syndrome, and craniopharyngioma. Historical insights trace initial apoplexy description to 1898 by Pearce Bailey and subsequent surgical advances in transsphenoidal resection by Harvey Cushing in the early 20th century. Knowledge of sella anatomy guides safe surgical corridors and radiological interpretation.","pathophysiology":"Pituitary apoplexy arises from sudden hemorrhage or infarction within a preexisting adenoma. At the molecular level, vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression and fragile neovascularization predispose to microaneurysms. Platelet activation and local thrombosis trigger ischemia, while cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha amplify vascular permeability. Pituitary adenomas often harbor mutations in menin (MEN1 gene) or GNAS in somatotrophs; less frequently, aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) mutations contribute to tumor growth. Ischemia initiates apoptosis via caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. The infarction phase typically unfolds over minutes to hours, with necrotic cell debris invoking neutrophil infiltration and release of reactive oxygen species. Compensatory neovascular remodeling is limited by the rigid bony sella. Elevated intracapsular pressure compresses surrounding pituitary tissue, leading to hormone deficiencies and local cranial nerve III, IV, and VI dysfunction within the cavernous sinus. Progression spans acute (0\u201372 hours), subacute (3\u201314 days), and chronic (>14 days) phases, each with evolving inflammatory and fibrotic changes.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of pituitary apoplexy is typically sudden, with headache peaking within minutes and often described as the \u2018worst headache of life.\u2019 Nausea and vomiting accompany within 30 minutes in 70% of patients. Visual symptoms appear in 60%\u201385%, including bitemporal hemianopia due to optic chiasm compression. Ophthalmoplegia occurs in 50% from cavernous sinus involvement, often with ptosis, diplopia, and pupillary abnormalities. Fever or meningismus may present in 15%. Acute adrenal insufficiency manifests within hours as hypotension and hyponatremia. Adult females predominate (female:male ratio ~1.3:1), whereas pediatric presentations are rare (<5%) and often associate with Sheehan\u2019s syndrome. Elderly patients may have subtler symptoms but higher mortality. Severity scales include the Pituitary Apoplexy Score (0\u201310) incorporating consciousness, ocular signs, and visual acuity. Without treatment, mortality approaches 20%, and permanent hypopituitarism occurs in 50%\u201375%. Early identification of red flags such as acute hormonal crisis or cranial nerve deficits is critical.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial assessment follows an algorithm: stabilize airway, breathing, circulation, then acute endocrine evaluation including serum cortisol, ACTH, TSH, free T4, prolactin, and electrolytes. Baseline cortisol <3 \u00b5g/dL confirms adrenal crisis with 92% sensitivity. Noncontrast CT head reveals hyperdense sellar lesion in ~60% within first 24 hours. Contrast-enhanced MRI with T1-weighted sequences after gadolinium yields >90% sensitivity for hemorrhage and infarction, demonstrating heterogeneous signal in pituitary gland. When MRI is contraindicated, CT angiography rules out aneurysm. Lumbar puncture is rarely required but may show xanthochromia and elevated protein (100\u2013300 mg/dL) if subarachnoid extension occurs. Formal visual field testing via automated perimetry quantifies bitemporal hemianopia. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is reserved for equivocal Cushing\u2019s disease but not for apoplexy. Differential should consider subarachnoid hemorrhage (CT shows cisternal blood), meningitis (CSF pleocytosis >100 cells/mm3 and low glucose), and cavernous sinus thrombosis (MR venography demonstrates absent flow).","management_principles":"Initial management includes immediate intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg bolus followed by 50\u2013100 mg every 6 hours to treat adrenal crisis and reduce edema. If hypotension persists, add fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily for mineralocorticoid support. Neurosurgical consultation for transsphenoidal decompression is indicated within 72 hours in patients with neuro-ophthalmic deficits or deteriorating consciousness. Recent meta-analysis reports 85% visual improvement postoperatively when surgery is performed within 7 days. For patients without severe deficits, conservative treatment with corticosteroids and close monitoring in an ICU for 72 hours yields favorable outcomes in 70% of cases. Second-line agents such as dopamine agonists are used if prolactinomas complicate apoplexy; bromocriptine initial dose 1.25 mg twice daily. Fluid and electrolyte balance is monitored hourly; sodium targets are 135\u2013145 mEq/L. Complication management includes antiepileptic prophylaxis with levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily if seizures occur. Supportive care entails deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily unless contraindicated by hemorrhage. Special populations such as pregnant patients require multidisciplinary coordination with obstetrics for fetal monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"After discharge, patients should follow up with endocrinology at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months, then every 6 months for the first year. At each visit, assess pituitary hormone axes: morning cortisol target >10 \u00b5g/dL, free T4 in normal range (0.8\u20131.8 ng/dL), and sodium 135\u2013145 mEq/L. MRI of the sellar region at 3 months and yearly for 2 years monitors residual adenoma growth; recurrence risk is 10% at 5 years. Visual field testing repeats at 3 months and annually. Lifelong hormonal replacement is required in 80% of survivors. One-year functional outcome shows full recovery in 60%, while 5-year data indicate chronic hypopituitarism in 50%. Rehabilitation includes neuro-ophthalmology for persistent diplopia and psychology support for quality of life. Patients should avoid heavy lifting or activities that raise intracranial pressure for 6 weeks. Driving restrictions for 3 months if visual deficits persist. Patient education focuses on adrenal crisis prevention, stress dosing when ill, and medical alert bracelets. Support organizations include The Pituitary Foundation and Endocrine Society resources.","clinical_pearls":"1. The hallmark triad of pituitary apoplexy: sudden headache, visual disturbance, and hormonal crisis. 2. Cortisol <3 \u00b5g/dL within 24 hours confirms adrenal insufficiency with 92% sensitivity. 3. MRI with T1\u2010weighted gadolinium sequence is the gold standard for hemorrhage detection (>90% sensitivity). 4. Timing of surgery within 7 days improves visual outcome from 65% to 85%. 5. Avoid routine lumbar puncture if CT/MRI already shows sellar hemorrhage. 6. Remember that up to 40% of apoplexy cases occur in previously undiagnosed adenomas. 7.

Associated symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, visual disturbance (due to compression of the optic chiasm), ophthalmoplegia (cranial nerve III, IV, or VI palsies from cavernous sinus involvement), and potentially altered mental status if adrenal insufficiency develops. Noncontrast CT may reveal hyperdensity within the sella turcica, but MRI is the more sensitive modality. \n\nIn this question, the CT imaging already demonstrates features consistent with intrasellar hemorrhage. Headache variants such as migraine (B), tension-type headache (C), or cluster headache (D) do not typically show acute hemorrhage on CT. Migraine is a primary headache disorder with no structural lesion, and while it can present with severe pain, imaging is normal. Tension-type headache is mild-to-moderate and bilateral, without focal imaging findings. Cluster headache is short-lived, severe, unilateral orbital or temporal pain occurring in clusters but likewise yields no intracranial hemorrhage on imaging. \n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis given sudden severe headache and CT evidence of pituitary hemorrhage is pituitary apoplexy. Early endocrine evaluation and neurosurgical consultation are indicated to manage potential adrenal crisis and decompress mass effect.","source_file":"Promotion 2021_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Headache","import_source":"headache_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"2","question":"A pregnant woman with a history of migraines requires prophylactic treatment. What is the best option?","options":["Propranolol","Topiramate","Amitriptyline","Verapamil"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Propranolol","subspecialty":"Headache","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Propranolol. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses (AAN 2012, Level A evidence) have demonstrated that propranolol reduces migraine frequency by approximately 50% in 60% of patients. In pregnancy, propranolol (FDA category C) has the most robust safety data, whereas topiramate is associated with a twofold increased risk of oral clefts (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.29\u20133.88) and amitriptyline can cause maternal sedation and anticholinergic effects. Verapamil has only Level B evidence and is considered a third-line agent. Option B (Topiramate) carries teratogenic risks. Option C (Amitriptyline) is less effective for migraine prophylaxis and has greater side effects. Option D (Verapamil) lacks strong efficacy data and is not first-line.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is classified in ICHD-3 as a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent unilateral throbbing pain with associated nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Prophylaxis is indicated when attacks exceed four per month or significantly impair quality of life. During pregnancy, drug selection balances efficacy and fetal safety. Beta-blockers like propranolol cross the placenta but observational studies (n>1,500 exposures) have not shown increased major malformations. Nosologically, migraine falls under G43 in ICD-11; differential includes tension-type headache and secondary causes. Historical use of ergotamines is now replaced by safer agents. Embryologically, the vascular reactivity implicated in migraine originates from neural crest\u2013derived smooth muscle cells. Neurotransmitter dysregulation (serotonin, CGRP) underlies attacks, and beta-blockers modulate adrenergic tone within the trigeminovascular system.","pathophysiology":"Normal migraine physiology involves activation of the trigeminovascular pathway leading to release of vasoactive neuropeptides (CGRP, substance P) and neurogenic inflammation. Propranolol\u2019s mechanism in prophylaxis includes stabilization of vascular tone by blocking \u03b21/\u03b22 receptors on intracranial vessels, reducing cortical excitability, and modulating central noradrenergic transmission in the locus coeruleus. Molecularly, \u03b2-blockade reduces cAMP production, decreases CGRP release, and dampens neuronal hyperexcitability. These effects attenuate the frequency of spreading cortical depression events that manifest clinically as migraine. In pregnancy, hormonal fluctuations augment vascular sensitivity; propranolol\u2019s stabilization effect is particularly beneficial.","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine prophylaxis is considered when patients experience \u22654 moderate-to-severe attacks per month or any disabling episode. Key clinical indicators include headache duration >4 hours, photophobia in 80% of cases, phonophobia in 75%, and nausea in 70%. In pregnant patients, monitoring for orthostatic hypotension (up to 15% incidence) and fetal growth restriction (<5% risk) is recommended. Nonpharmacological triggers (sleep disruption, stress) are also addressed concurrently. Subtypes include menstrual migraine, vestibular migraine, and hemiplegic migraine, each requiring tailored prophylaxis.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes a detailed headache diary, neurological examination, and exclusion of secondary causes with red-flag screening (Rule: SNOOP4). No routine imaging is required in stable patients without atypical features. Laboratory tests (CBC, thyroid function) may rule out contributing factors. In pregnancy, MR without contrast is reserved for atypical presentations. Pre-test probability for migraine in this context exceeds 90%, thus advanced testing yields low NNT. Timing of initiation should follow confirmation of diagnosis and baseline blood pressure measurement.","management_principles":"Guidelines (AHS/AAN 2012, Class I recommendation) recommend starting propranolol at 10\u201320 mg twice daily, titrating every 2 weeks to a maximum of 80\u2013120 mg/day. Expected reduction in attack frequency is ~50% in 60% of users (NNT=2.5). Monitor maternal blood pressure and fetal growth. If intolerant, consider amitriptyline (25 mg nightly) with caution. Nonpharmacological measures include sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, and avoidance of triggers. Dose adjustments postpartum may be necessary for lactation safety (excreted in breast milk in low amounts).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 4\u20136 weeks initially to assess efficacy and tolerability. Monitor for side effects: bradycardia (<1%) and hypotension (<5%). Obtain fetal ultrasound at 20 weeks to assess growth. Continue prophylaxis for at least 6 months after achieving a 50% reduction in attack frequency before considering taper. Document headache frequency in a diary. After taper, reassess need for reinitiation if attacks recur.","clinical_pearls":"1. Propranolol is the only beta-blocker with robust pregnancy safety data (Level A evidence). 2. Start low and go slow: begin at 10 mg BID to minimize hypotension. 3. Maintain a headache diary for at least 4 weeks pre- and post-initiation to assess response. 4. Nonpharmacological triggers (e.g., sleep irregularity) can undermine pharmacotherapy\u2014address concurrently. 5.

Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) presents with recurrent thunderclap headaches over days to weeks, often with normal initial MRI/MRV. Angiography later reveals segmental narrowing and dilatation of cerebral arteries that resolves within 12 weeks (Calabrese et al. 2007). Option B (Subarachnoid hemorrhage) causes a single thunderclap headache with blood on CT or xanthochromia in CSF; normal MRI/MRV argue against SAH.

Option D (Tension headache) presents with bilateral pressing pain lacking abrupt onset.","conceptual_foundation":"Headache disorders per ICHD-3: thunderclap headache (6.7) includes SAH, RCVS, cervicocephalic artery dissection, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. RCVS epidemiology peaks in middle-aged women; triggers include exercise, sexual activity, vasoactive drugs. Pathologically, transient dysregulation of cerebrovascular tone leads to multifocal vasoconstriction and vasodilation.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebrovascular tone is maintained by a balance of endothelial nitric oxide and smooth muscle responses. In RCVS, an acute surge in vasoconstrictor stimuli (sympathetic overactivity, vasoactive substances) leads to prolonged smooth muscle contraction, segmental arterial narrowing, and ischemia. Over weeks, sympathetic tone normalizes and vessels return to baseline, distinguishing RCVS from primary angiitis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients describe sudden-onset severe headache reaching maximal intensity within one minute, often multiple episodes over 1\u20133 weeks.
