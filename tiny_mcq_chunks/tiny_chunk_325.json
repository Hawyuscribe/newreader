[{"question_number":"7","question":"A patient with back pain radiating to the left lower limb and normal ankle reflexes is evaluated. Which muscle is involved?","options":["Superior gluteus","Iliopsoas","Hamstrings","Quadriceps"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Superior gluteus","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Superior gluteus. In a patient with back pain radiating to the lower limb and a preserved ankle (S1) reflex, the L5 nerve root is most likely involved. The primary muscle that tests L5 function in the pelvic region is the gluteus medius, innervated by the superior gluteal nerve (L4\u2013S1, with L5 predominance). Iliopsoas (B) is innervated by L1\u2013L3; hamstrings (C) by L5\u2013S2; quadriceps (D) by L2\u2013L4. Because the ankle reflex (S1) is intact, involvement is above S1, and hip abduction testing via the superior gluteus (gluteus medius) is appropriate for L5 radiculopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"Radiculopathies are classified by the nerve root level. The L5 root exits the spine between L5 and S1 and innervates muscles controlling hip abduction (gluteus medius), foot dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior), and toe extension. Knowledge of dermatomes and myotomes is essential. In ICD-11, radiculopathy is coded under neuropathic pain related to spinal disorders. Differential diagnoses include claudication, bursitis, and hip arthritis. Embryologically, the dorsal root ganglion neurons for L5 derive from neural crest cells; the superior gluteal nerve arises from the dorsal divisions of the L4\u2013S1 ventral rami.","pathophysiology":"Normal L5 root function allows for hip abduction via gluteus medius. Compression of the L5 root\u2014due to disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, or facet hypertrophy\u2014leads to impaired signaling along the superior gluteal nerve. Demyelination and axonal injury reduce motor unit recruitment in gluteus medius, while S1 fibers remain intact, preserving the ankle jerk. Chronic compression may induce Wallerian degeneration and muscle atrophy.","clinical_manifestation":"L5 radiculopathy presents with lower back pain radiating to the lateral thigh and shin, often sparing the calf reflex. Patients report difficulty with hip abduction and foot dorsiflexion. There may be sensory deficits over the dorsum of the foot and first web space. On exam, hip abduction is weak (Medical Research Council grade \u22644/5), while the ankle jerk is normal.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier assessment includes detailed history, neurologic exam focusing on myotomes and reflexes, and straight-leg raise test. MRI of the lumbar spine is indicated to visualize disc herniation or canal stenosis. EMG and nerve conduction studies can localize L5 involvement and exclude peripheral neuropathy.","management_principles":"Conservative management with NSAIDs, physical therapy emphasizing core stabilization and stretching of paraspinal muscles. Epidural steroid injections may be considered for persistent radicular pain. Surgical decompression (microdiscectomy or laminotomy) is reserved for refractory cases or progressive neurologic deficits.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess clinically every 4\u20136 weeks. Repeat imaging if new or worsening neurologic signs. Monitor functional recovery of hip abduction strength and gait. Transition to long-term core strengthening and ergonomic modifications to prevent recurrence.","clinical_pearls":"1. L5 radiculopathy often spares the Achilles reflex. 2. Hip abduction weakness localizes to L5 via the superior gluteal nerve. 3. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for suspected nerve root compression. 4. Early physical therapy can prevent chronic back pain. 5. Progressive motor weakness warrants surgical evaluation.","references":"1. Bogduk N. Clinical Anatomy of the Lumbar Spine and Sacrum.

What is the likely diagnosis?","options":["GCG Repeat","D4Z4"],"subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Part Two","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"GCG repeat expansion in the PABPN1 gene causing oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy","explanation":{"Option Analysis":"The clinical presentation of ptosis, extraocular muscle weakness, progressive dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness in a 55-year-old patient is most consistent with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), which arises from an expanded GCG repeat in the PABPN1 gene. Option A (GCG Repeat) corresponds directly to this genetic abnormality and matches the phenotype of late-onset ptosis and pharyngeal muscle involvement. Option B (D4Z4) refers to the deletion on chromosome 4q35 seen in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). FSHD typically presents with facial weakness (inability to whistle or close eyes), scapular winging, and humeral girdle weakness rather than dysphagia or isolated ocular findings. Moreover, FSHD onset is usually in adolescence or early adulthood rather than the fifth decade. There is no primary involvement of extraocular muscles or pronounced dysphagia in D4Z4 contraction disorders. In contrast, OPMD\u2019s defining features\u2014insidious bilateral ptosis, early swallowing difficulties due to cricopharyngeal muscle spasm, and mild proximal limb weakness\u2014are hallmark signs of a GCG repeat expansion. Thus, the correct choice is A.","Conceptual Foundation":"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy primarily involves the levator palpebrae superioris and pharyngeal constrictor muscles, both innervated by cranial nerves III and X respectively. Pathways include NMJ transmission and the integrity of myofiber nuclei. In normal physiology, PABPN1 regulates poly(A) tail length in RNA processing within myonuclei. Expansion of the GCG tract in PABPN1 leads to insoluble intranuclear aggregates that impair transcriptional regulation in skeletal myocytes. Related conditions such as myasthenia gravis affect the NMJ but present with fluctuating weakness and autoantibodies against AChR or MuSK, whereas mitochondrial myopathies show ragged red fibers and multisystem involvement. FSHD involves epigenetic derepression of DUX4 in muscle. Understanding these anatomical and molecular underpinnings helps differentiate OPMD from other neuromuscular disorders in board exams.","Pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy results from a short GCG expansion (normal: 6 repeats; disease: 8\u201313 repeats) in exon 1 of PABPN1 on chromosome 14. The expanded polyalanine tract induces misfolding of PABPN1, nuclear aggregation, and proteasome impairment. Aggregates sequester transcription factors, altering RNA polyadenylation and reducing nuclear export of muscle transcripts. This triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to fiber atrophy. There is no primary autoimmune or inflammatory infiltrate. In contrast, FSHD involves D4Z4 repeat contraction with aberrant DUX4 expression, triggering immune and oxidative stress. In OPMD, ACh receptor density and NMJ architecture remain intact, distinguishing it from myasthenic syndromes. Genetic anticipation is minimal, and inflammatory cytokines are not prominent, underscoring a toxic gain-of-function mechanism intrinsic to muscle nuclei.","Clinical Manifestation":"OPMD typically presents in the fourth to sixth decade. Initial signs include mild bilateral ptosis due to levator palpebrae atrophy. Extraocular muscles, particularly vertical gaze, become slowly weakened but rarely paralyzed. Dysphagia arises from cricopharyngeal dysfunction, leading to choking, aspiration, and weight loss. Proximal limb weakness affects pelvic and shoulder girdles, causing difficulty rising from chairs and lifting arms. Progression is gradual over decades; severity correlates weakly with repeat length and age at onset. Respiratory involvement is uncommon but can occur if bulbar dysfunction is severe. Facial expression may be preserved. Prognostic indicators include severity of dysphagia and degree of respiratory compromise. Unlike myasthenia gravis, symptoms do not fluctuate acutely or improve with rest. Absence of systemic features such as endocrinopathy or ocular ptosis variability helps distinguish OPMD from mimic disorders.","Diagnostic Approach":"Diagnosis begins with clinical suspicion in a middle-aged patient with ptosis and dysphagia. Serum CK is mildly elevated or normal. Needle EMG reveals myopathic potentials with early recruitment; occasional fibrillations reflect muscle fiber degeneration. Swallow study and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation assess pharyngeal phase impairment. Muscle MRI shows selective fatty infiltration of bulbar and proximal limb muscles. Definitive diagnosis is by genetic testing: PCR sizing or Southern blot for GCG repeat number in PABPN1. Muscle biopsy, usually of deltoid, demonstrates rimmed vacuoles, intranuclear inclusions, and tubular aggregates without significant inflammation. Differential diagnoses include myasthenia gravis (edrophonium test, AChR antibodies), mitochondrial myopathy (ragged red fibers, COX-negative fibers), and FSHD (genetic D4Z4 testing). A tailored algorithm ensures targeted investigations without unnecessary immunosuppression trials.","Management Principles":"There is no cure for OPMD; management is symptomatic. For ptosis causing visual field defects, bilateral blepharoplasty with levator resection can be performed (typical dose of local anesthetic: lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000). Dysphagia is managed by cricopharyngeal myotomy or dilation; feeding tube placement may be necessary in severe cases. Physical therapy preserves proximal strength; aerobic exercise is encouraged at low intensity. Genetic counseling is essential due to autosomal dominant inheritance. There is no role for anticholinesterases or immunosuppressants. Monitoring for aspiration pneumonia prompts prophylactic vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus. Speech therapy with swallowing maneuvers improves safety. Investigational approaches, such as small molecules targeting PABPN1 aggregation and antisense oligonucleotides, are under evaluation in clinical trials (Phase II data pending).","Follow-up Guidelines":"Long-term follow-up should include biannual swallowing assessments and respiratory evaluations (spirometry, maximal inspiratory pressure). Monitor nutritional status and weight quarterly to preempt dysphagia-related malnutrition. Annual ophthalmologic exams assess ptosis progression and ocular surface integrity. Regular dental evaluations help reduce aspiration risk. Pulmonary function tests every 12 months detect early restrictive patterns. Genetic counseling follow-up for family planning is recommended. Educate patients on recognizing signs of aspiration pneumonia and maintaining safe swallowing techniques. Consider periodic psychological support to address quality-of-life concerns. Coordinate multidisciplinary care among neurology, otolaryngology, gastroenterology, and physiatry to optimize outcomes and mitigate complications over decades-long disease course.","Clinical Pearls":"1. Late-onset ptosis and progressive dysphagia in a middle-aged adult strongly suggest OPMD rather than myasthenia gravis or FSHD. 2. Unlike MG, OPMD exhibits non-fluctuating weakness, normal AChR antibody titers, and myopathic EMG. 3. Rimmed vacuoles on muscle biopsy are a histopathologic hallmark; absence of inflammatory cells rules out polymyositis. 4. GCG repeat length correlates modestly with age at onset but not severity; anticipation is uncommon. 5. Surgical management of ptosis and cricopharyngeal dysfunction improves quality of life. 6. Recent guidelines emphasize genetic testing early to avoid unnecessary immunotherapy. 7. Investigational therapies targeting protein aggregation may alter future management.","References":"1.

Patients typically present in early adulthood with isolated distal lower\u2010limb weakness\u2014most prominently in the posterior calf muscles\u2014leading to marked difficulty in plantar flexion. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are characteristically very high, often exceeding 30\u00d7 the upper limit of normal, consistent with this patient\u2019s 35\u00d7 elevation. Option B, Polymyositis, presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness, elevated inflammatory markers, endomysial inflammation on biopsy, and improvement with corticosteroids, unlike the distal\u2010predominant, treatment\u2010resistant picture here. Option C, Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease, is a hereditary peripheral neuropathy featuring distal muscle wasting plus sensory loss, but CK levels remain near normal and reflexes are diminished. Option D, Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome, has proximal muscle fatigue, autonomic symptoms, and an incremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation, without profound CK elevation. Option E, Inclusion Body Myositis, occurs in older adults (>50 years), affects finger flexors and quadriceps, and demonstrates only modest CK increases. The combination of distal calf\u2010predominant weakness, inability to plantar flex, and extreme CK elevation strongly supports Dysferlinopathy.","Conceptual Foundation":"The posterior thigh (hamstring) and posterior calf (gastrocnemius, soleus) muscle groups are innervated by the tibial division of the sciatic nerve, originating from L4\u2013S3 roots. These muscles generate plantar flexion at the ankle and knee flexion. Dysferlin is a membrane\u2010associated protein critical for sarcolemmal repair after microtrauma incurred during eccentric contractions. In dysferlinopathies, defective membrane resealing triggers repeated cycles of fiber necrosis and regeneration. Neurologically, this manifests as a primary myopathy with intact sensory pathways and preserved reflex arcs until advanced stages. Differential diagnoses include inflammatory myopathies (polymyositis, dermatomyositis), hereditary neuropathies (Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth), and neuromuscular transmission disorders (Lambert\u2013Eaton)\u2014each showing distinct anatomical or electrophysiological signatures. Recognizing the pattern of distal, calf\u2010dominant weakness with extreme CK elevations allows precise categorization of primary muscle membrane repair disorders versus other neuromuscular etiologies.","Pathophysiology":"Dysferlinopathy is caused by loss\u2010of\u2010function mutations in DYSF, leading to absent or dysfunctional dysferlin protein at the sarcolemma. Dysferlin normally mediates Ca2+\u2010dependent vesicle fusion to patch sarcolemmal tears. In its absence, microinjuries from normal muscle contraction result in unsealed membrane disruptions, uncontrolled calcium influx, and activation of proteolytic cascades. This culminates in myofiber necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and release of intracellular enzymes, including CK. Chronic cycles of muscle fiber degeneration and regeneration lead to fatty infiltration and fibrosis on imaging. Unlike autoimmune myositis, inflammatory infiltrates in dysferlinopathy are secondary to muscle degeneration rather than primary immunogenic attacks. The absence of dysferlin impairs satellite cell\u2010mediated repair and promotes progressive muscle wasting. Genetic factors such as specific DYSF mutations correlate with age of onset and severity. No specific receptor or neurotransmitter defect is implicated; the pathology is intrinsic to the muscle fiber membrane integrity rather than synaptic transmission or neural conduction.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients with dysferlinopathy typically present in late adolescence to early adulthood (15\u201330 years) with slowly progressive distal muscle weakness. Early signs include difficulty rising on tiptoes, frequent tripping, and calf contour changes (pseudo\u2010hypertrophy or atrophy). Posterior thigh (hamstring) weakness emerges subsequently, impairing knee flexion. Proximal muscles remain relatively spared in early stages. Sensation is normal, and deep tendon reflexes are preserved until extensive muscle loss occurs. Facial and bulbar muscles are unaffected. Serum CK levels often exceed 30\u00d7 upper limits, sometimes reaching 50\u2013100\u00d7. The disease course is gradual over decades; patients may require ankle\u2013foot orthoses by mid\u2010adult life. Respiratory and cardiac involvement is uncommon but should be monitored. Prognosis depends on mutation type and residual dysferlin function. Some patients remain ambulatory into their 50s, while others develop contractures and gait impairment earlier. Functional scales such as the 6\u2010minute walk test track progression and assist in clinical trials.","Diagnostic Approach":"Initial evaluation includes CK measurement revealing marked elevation. Electromyography shows myopathic motor unit potentials with early recruitment and occasional fibrillations. Nerve conduction studies are normal. MRI of lower\u2010limb muscles demonstrates selective fatty infiltration and edema in posterior compartments (gastrocnemius, soleus, semitendinosus). Definitive diagnosis requires genetic testing: target sequencing or next\u2010generation panels revealing DYSF mutations. Muscle biopsy, if performed, shows dystrophic changes with muscle fiber size variation, internal nuclei, endomysial fibrosis, and near\u2010absent dysferlin immunostaining on immunohistochemistry. Inflammatory cell infiltrates are typically secondary and patchy. Differential diagnosis includes polymyositis (biopsy shows primary inflammatory changes), mitochondrial myopathies (ragged\u2010red fibers), and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (distinct scapular winging). Cardiac evaluation (ECG, echocardiogram) and pulmonary function tests rule out systemic involvement. Genetic counseling is indicated for family screening.","Management Principles":"There is currently no disease\u2010modifying therapy for dysferlinopathy. Management focuses on maintaining function and preventing complications. Physical therapy emphasizes low\u2010to\u2010moderate intensity, non\u2010eccentric exercises to preserve muscle strength without accelerating fiber breakdown. Ankle\u2013foot orthoses improve gait stability and reduce fall risk. Pain management may involve NSAIDs or neuropathic agents. Immunosuppressive therapies (steroids, methotrexate) are generally ineffective and may worsen muscle strength. Experimental approaches include gene therapy with adeno\u2010associated viral vectors carrying DYSF, exon skipping, and cell\u2010based therapies; these remain investigational. Cardiorespiratory monitoring guides supportive interventions. Nutritional support ensures adequate caloric and protein intake without promoting obesity. Avoidance of high\u2010dose corticosteroids and strenuous eccentric activity is critical to minimize muscle necrosis. Referral to a multidisciplinary neuromuscular clinic facilitates access to orthotics, rehabilitation specialists, and genetic counseling. Patient participation in clinical trials should be considered where available.","Follow-up Guidelines":"Patients should undergo neuromuscular assessment and CK monitoring every 6\u201312 months to track disease progression. Functional evaluation using standardized tests (6-minute walk, timed up\u2010and-go) documents ambulatory status. Annual MRI can quantify muscle fat infiltration for research settings. Respiratory function tests (spirometry, diffusion capacity) should be performed annually, given rare diaphragmatic involvement. Baseline and periodic cardiac evaluation (ECG, echocardiogram) rule out conduction defects or cardiomyopathy. Regular orthopedic assessment addresses contractures and gait abnormalities; interventions may include tendon lengthening or bracing. Bone density monitoring is indicated if chronic immobility or steroid exposure occurs. Genetic counseling provides family screening and reproductive guidance. Patient education covers fall prevention, home safety, and avoidance of strenuous eccentric exercise. Coordination with physical and occupational therapy optimizes adaptive devices. Referral to support groups aids psychosocial coping. Clinical trial enrollment options should be reviewed periodically.","Clinical Pearls":"\u2022 Dysferlinopathy (Miyoshi myopathy) presents with early calf and posterior thigh weakness and extreme CK elevation (>30\u00d7).  \n\u2022 Distal\u2010predominant pattern with preserved sensation and reflexes helps differentiate from neuropathies.  \n\u2022 Muscle biopsy shows dystrophic changes with absent dysferlin immunostaining; inflammation is secondary.  \n\u2022 Genetic testing for DYSF mutations confirms diagnosis; carriers are asymptomatic.  \n\u2022 Steroids and immunosuppressants are ineffective and may harm; focus on low\u2010resistance exercises and orthoses.  \n\u2022 MRI of lower limbs reveals selective posterior compartment involvement, guiding biopsy site.  \n\u2022 Monitor respiratory and cardiac function annually despite low risk of systemic involvement.  \n\u2022 New gene\u2010replacement and exon\u2010skipping trials are ongoing\u2014consider referral to specialty centers.  \n\u2022 Avoid eccentric loading to prevent membrane tears and CK spikes.  \n\u2022 Early genetic counseling and multidisciplinary care improve quality of life and functional outcomes.","References":"1.

In ICD-11, CMT2 is coded under FA2Z, \u2018Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, axonal\u2019. Differential diagnoses include hereditary motor neuropathy, distal hereditary motor neuropathy, and acquired neuropathies (e.g., diabetic). Historically, CMT was first described in 1886 by Charcot and Marie; the division into demyelinating (CMT1) versus axonal (CMT2) forms emerged in the 1990s with the advent of nerve conduction studies. Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest cells, which develop Schwann cells (demyelination) and axons (axonal disorders). The genes most frequently implicated in CMT2 include MFN2 (CMT2A), RAB7A (CMT2B), and NEFL (CMT2E), affecting mitochondrial fusion, endosomal trafficking, and neurofilament assembly, respectively.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral nerve conduction relies on intact axonal transport and myelination. In CMT2, primary axonal degeneration occurs due to genetic mutations impairing mitochondrial dynamics (e.g., MFN2 mutations reduce mitochondrial fusion, leading to axonal energy deficits) and neurofilament structure (e.g., NEFL mutations alter axonal cytoskeleton). These molecular defects cause distal axonal \u2018dying-back\u2019 degeneration, leading to reduced SNAP amplitudes.
