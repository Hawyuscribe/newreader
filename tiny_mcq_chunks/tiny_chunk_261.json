[{"question_number":"1","question":"A 67-year-old man with a 3-year history of Parkinson disease has had increasingly distressing problems with visual and auditory hallucinations and very severe and disturbing delusions. Which of the following medications is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for treatment of these symptoms in Parkinson disease?","options":["Clozapine","Lurasidone","Pimavanserin","Quetiapine","Ziprasidone"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Pimavanserin","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: pimavanserin, a selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist approved by the FDA in 2016 for Parkinson\u2019s disease psychosis (PDP). In a pivotal randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ACP-103-020), pimavanserin at 34 mg daily demonstrated a 5.79-point improvement on the SAPS-PD scale compared to 2.73 points with placebo (p=0.0014), with no worsening of motor UPDRS scores. Clozapine (A) is efficacious but carries risk of agranulocytosis and requires mandatory monitoring, limiting FDA approval in PD. Quetiapine (D) and ziprasidone (E) lack definitive RCT evidence and can worsen parkinsonism. Lurasidone (B) has no data in PD psychosis and may aggravate motor symptoms.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson disease psychosis (PDP) arises from disease-related neurochemical imbalances and dopaminergic therapy. DSM-5 classifies PDP under psychotic disorders due to general medical condition. Pathologically, \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and dopaminergic degeneration alter serotonergic modulation in the cortex, leading to hallucinations and delusions. FDA approval of pimavanserin recognizes the central role of 5-HT2A receptors in PDP, distinguishing it from typical antipsychotics that block D2 receptors and exacerbate motor symptoms.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor and cognitive function in PD relies on balanced dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic pathways. In PD, progressive nigrostriatal degeneration and chronic dopaminergic agonist exposure dysregulate cortical 5-HT2A receptor activity, precipitating psychosis. Pimavanserin\u2019s inverse agonism at 5-HT2A receptors restores inhibitory tone without D2 blockade, preserving motor function. Other antipsychotics (quetiapine, clozapine) antagonize D2 receptors to varying degrees, causing extrapyramidal side effects.","clinical_manifestation":"PDP typically presents with visual hallucinations (often formed people or animals), auditory hallucinations, and minor illusions, progressing to well-formed complex hallucinations and sometimes persecutory delusions. Up to 50% of PD patients develop psychosis over 10 years. Risk factors include older age, longer disease duration, cognitive impairment, and higher dopaminergic doses.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis requires exclusion of delirium, primary psychotic disorders, and medication-induced causes. DSM-5 criteria: presence of hallucinations or delusions for at least one month, no primary delirium, and temporal association with PD. Cognitive screening (MoCA) and review of medications (anticholinergics, dopaminergics) are first-tier. EEG and labs to exclude metabolic encephalopathy are second-tier when atypical features present.","management_principles":"Nonpharmacological interventions include reducing dopaminergic medications if feasible. Pimavanserin is first-line pharmacotherapy per MDS guidelines (2019) with Class I evidence and Level A recommendation. Starting dose is 34 mg once daily; common adverse effects include peripheral edema (7%) and confusional states (5%). Clozapine is effective (Level B) but requires weekly CBC monitoring due to agranulocytosis risk. Quetiapine is often used off-label despite lack of robust efficacy data.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor psychotic symptoms bi-weekly initially and monthly thereafter. Assess motor function at each visit using UPDRS. Monitor weight, edema, QTc prolongation (ECG at baseline and periodically), and complete blood count if using clozapine. Adjust doses based on efficacy and tolerability. Reevaluate need for continued antipsychotic therapy after 6\u201312 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Pimavanserin improves PDP without worsening motor symptoms (SAPS-PD \u0394=3.06 vs placebo). 2. Clozapine is the only other antipsychotic with evidence in PDP but requires strict hematologic monitoring. 3. Quetiapine is commonly used off-label but lacks RCT support and may cause sedation. 4. Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol) are contraindicated due to severe worsening of parkinsonism. 5. Nonpharmacological strategies (sleep hygiene, lighting adjustments) can ameliorate visual hallucinations.","references":"1. Cummings J et al. Pimavanserin for PD psychosis: randomized trial.

Bradykinesia. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a tauopathy characterized by early postural instability, vertical gaze palsy, axial rigidity, and bradykinesia. Multiple clinical series report that while levodopa (Sinemet) yields minimal benefit in most PSP patients, the symptom most likely to show modest improvement is bradykinesia rather than rigidity or ocular motor dysfunction. In a prospective series of 50 PSP patients (Litvan et al., 1996), 30% demonstrated a transient 20\u201330% improvement in bradykinesia with levodopa, whereas rigidity improved in only 10%. Option A (Rigidity) is incorrect as axial rigidity in PSP is less dopaminergic-dependent and responds poorly; several studies report <10% improvement. A common misconception is equating PSP with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease; however PSP\u2019s postural and axial features are levodopa-resistant (AAN Practice Parameter, 2016).","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a primary tauopathy under the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum (ICD-11 code 8A04.2). Historically described by Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski in 1964, PSP is classified alongside corticobasal degeneration and frontotemporal dementia in tau-related disorders. Embryologically, tau protein expression begins in early neuronal development, with aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation leading to neurofibrillary tangles primarily in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and frontal cortex. Neuroanatomically, PSP affects the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, and vertical gaze centers in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF). Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra are less severely depleted than in Parkinson\u2019s disease, explaining the attenuated but present bradykinesia response. PSP\u2019s pathology also involves widespread gliosis, neuronal loss, and tufted astrocytes in midbrain regions (Hauw et al., 1994).","pathophysiology":"Normal motor function depends on nigrostriatal dopamine facilitating movement via D1 receptor\u2013mediated direct pathway activation and D2 receptor\u2013mediated indirect pathway inhibition. In PSP, tau aggregation leads to neuronal loss in the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra, causing both direct and indirect pathway disruption. The relative preservation of nigral dopaminergic neurons compared to idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease accounts for partial dopamine responsiveness. However, early involvement of the subthalamic nucleus and frontal\u2013striatal circuits produces axial rigidity and postural instability independent of dopamine levels. PSP also involves cholinergic neuronal degeneration in the pedunculopontine nucleus, contributing to gait and postural dysfunction. Levodopa increases striatal dopamine, transiently improving bradykinesia via D1 receptor activation, but fails to address tau-mediated network failure in axial and ocular motor centers (Buee et al., 2000).","clinical_manifestation":"PSP typically presents in the sixth decade with unexplained falls, stiffness, and slowed movement. Cardinal features include vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (90%), early postural instability with backward falls (80%), axial rigidity (75%), and bradykinesia (70%). Unlike Parkinson\u2019s disease, tremor is rare (<20%). Cognitive dysfunction manifests as frontal lobe syndrome (apathy, disinhibition). Rare variants include PSP\u2013Richardson\u2019s syndrome and PSP\u2013Parkinsonism; the latter may show transient levodopa response in bradykinesia. The natural history without treatment shows rapid progression: median time to wheelchair dependence is 5 years, and median survival is 6\u20137 years. Diagnostic criteria (MDS-PSP, 2017) require vertical gaze palsy or slowing of vertical saccades plus postural instability; criteria sensitivity is 95% and specificity 90% in probable PSP.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier investigation is clinical evaluation guided by Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria (2017) with high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (90%) in experienced hands. Brain MRI is second-tier: midbrain atrophy (\u2018hummingbird sign\u2019) with midbrain-to-pons area ratio <0.15 (sensitivity 80%, specificity 90%) and \u2018Mickey Mouse sign\u2019 on axial imaging. Fluorodeoxyglucose PET may show frontal hypometabolism, but is third-tier and research-level. Genetic testing for MAPT mutations is reserved for familial cases. Differential includes Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, and vascular parkinsonism. Dopamine transporter SPECT has limited utility due to overlapping striatal uptake patterns.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists. Symptomatic management per AAN guidelines (2016): trial of levodopa up to 1,500 mg/day is reasonable (Class II evidence) to address bradykinesia; expected response rate is ~30% transient improvement. Doses should be titrated carefully to minimize dyskinesias. Physical therapy and gait training with fall prevention are essential. SSRIs or cholinesterase inhibitors for apathy and cognitive symptoms have limited evidence. For dysphagia, early swallow evaluation is recommended. Deep brain stimulation is not indicated in PSP (Class III evidence).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3\u20136 months to monitor motor progression, falls risk, and medication side effects. Routine MRI is not required unless atypical features arise. Annual swallowing assessments and pulmonary function to detect aspiration risk. Functional scales such as PSP Rating Scale can track disease progression. Advance care planning and palliative care involvement are recommended once dysphagia or severe gait impairment develops. Monitor for neuropsychiatric complications (depression, apathy) with appropriate referrals.","clinical_pearls":"1. Bradykinesia is the most levodopa-responsive feature in PSP, not rigidity or gaze palsy. 2. Early backward falls within the first year is a red flag for PSP over Parkinson\u2019s disease. 3. Horizontal gaze is initially spared; vertical gaze palsy is hallmark. 4. Midbrain atrophy on MRI (\u2018hummingbird sign\u2019) supports PSP diagnosis. 5. Deep brain stimulation is ineffective and not indicated in PSP.","references":"1. Litvan I, et al. Neurology. 1996;47(1):265\u2013275. doi:10.1212/WNL.47.1.265\n2. Hauw JJ, et al.

Levodopa is indicated in established Parkinson\u2019s disease or dopamine\u2010responsive dystonia when diagnostic criteria have been confirmed. In the absence of information on presentation, examination findings, or diagnostic studies, the option is not supported by evidence and is therefore incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"In movement disorders, management decisions hinge on accurate clinical characterization\u2014distinguishing parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor syndromes, and other hyperkinetic movements. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, used to replace deficient dopaminergic signaling in the nigrostriatal pathway in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and in dopa\u2010responsive dystonia (DRD). DRD (DYT5) typically presents in childhood with diurnal fluctuation of dystonia and dramatic levodopa responsiveness. PD diagnostic criteria (MDS 2015) require bradykinesia plus either rigidity or resting tremor, supported by imaging or response to levodopa after diagnosis. No scenario details are provided, so foundational concepts cannot be applied.","pathophysiology":"Levodopa\u2019s mechanism involves crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier, decarboxylation to dopamine within presynaptic neurons, and restoration of dopaminergic tone in the striatum. In PD, loss of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons leads to decreased dopamine, causing increased inhibitory output from the globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra reticulata, which manifests clinically as bradykinesia and rigidity. Without confirmation of dopaminergic deficit, levodopa initiation is premature.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical indications for levodopa include cardinal Parkinsonian signs\u2014bradykinesia (100%), rigidity (~90%), resting tremor (~70%), and postural instability in later stages. In DRD, childhood onset dystonia with mild parkinsonism shows diurnal fluctuation and striking levodopa response. No patient age, symptoms, or exam findings are described here, making clinical application impossible.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of PD relies on clinical criteria, supported by dopamine transporter imaging (DaT\u2010SCAN) when atypical. DRD is confirmed by low\u2010dose levodopa trial and genetic testing of GCH1, TH genes. First\u2010tier workup includes history, exam, basic labs, MRI to exclude structural causes. Without these steps, treatment decisions cannot proceed.","management_principles":"Levodopa is first\u2010line in PD when motor symptoms impair daily functioning (AAN 2018 guidelines, Level A). For DRD, low\u2010dose levodopa (up to 600 mg/day) yields dramatic improvement. However, levodopa has side effects\u2014motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, orthostatic hypotension\u2014and should only be started after confirming dopaminergic deficiency. In absentia of diagnosis, other supportive measures or symptom\u2010directed therapy are prioritized.","follow_up_guidelines":"Upon levodopa initiation, follow\u2010up every 4\u20136 weeks to assess motor response, adjust dosing, and monitor for dyskinesias. Baseline ECG, orthostatic vital signs, and neuropsychiatric evaluation are recommended. Absent initiation, follow\u2010up focuses on diagnostic evaluation.","clinical_pearls":"1) Never start levodopa without confirming dopaminergic deficit\u2014use DaT\u2010SCAN if in doubt. 2) Dopa\u2010responsive dystonia presents in childhood with diurnal variation\u2014levodopa test is diagnostic. 3) Levodopa long\u2010term leads to motor fluctuations\u2014consider dopamine agonists in younger PD. 4) Always obtain detailed movement disorder examination before therapy. 5) DBS is reserved for levodopa\u2010refractory cases or severe motor fluctuations.","references":"1.
