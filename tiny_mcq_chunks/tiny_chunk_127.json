Fluctuating high fevers, altered mental status, and anemia in a patient from Sudan are classic for cerebral malaria rather than bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, or an autoimmune process. Ceftriaxone plus vancomycin (option A) is first-line empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis but would not address parasitemia and anemia. Acyclovir (option C) treats herpes encephalitis, which presents with focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis rather than profound hemolytic anemia. Methylprednisolone (option D) is used for demyelinating or autoimmune CNS processes and would be contraindicated without first excluding infection. Current WHO guidelines (2021) recommend intravenous artesunate over quinine for severe falciparum malaria due to lower mortality (mortality 15% vs. 22% at 28 days; relative risk 0.69, 95% CI 0.59\u20130.80; Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Malaria is a protozoal infection caused by Plasmodium species, transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form, including cerebral malaria, defined by impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale <11), seizures, and microvascular sequestration of infected erythrocytes. In ICD-11, malaria is coded under 1C90; cerebral malaria is a life-threatening complication. Differential diagnoses for fever, AMS, and anemia include bacterial meningitis (ICD-11 1D40), viral encephalitis (1D70), trypanosomiasis (1C94), and hemolytic anemias such as sickle cell disease (3A10). Historically, quinine was mainstay; artemisinin derivatives emerged in the 1970s and are now first-line per WHO. Neuroanatomically, cerebral malaria involves capillary endothelium in the brain, with microvascular obstruction in watershed zones leading to diffuse encephalopathy. Embryologically, the CNS and hematopoietic system derive from ectoderm and mesoderm respectively, explaining lack of direct developmental linkage.","pathophysiology":"Normal human physiology involves splenic clearance of infected erythrocytes and intact blood\u2013brain barrier. In falciparum malaria, infected red blood cells express PfEMP1, which binds endothelial receptors (ICAM-1, CD36), causing sequestration in cerebral microvasculature. This leads to endothelial activation, blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, local inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), and microthrombi. The result is diffuse cerebral hypoxia, raised intracranial pressure, and neuronal dysfunction manifesting as AMS. Anemia arises from hemolysis of infected and uninfected erythrocytes, splenic clearance, and bone marrow suppression. Artesunate acts by generating free radicals within parasite-infected erythrocytes via its endoperoxide bridge, causing rapid parasite clearance. In contrast, ceftriaxone/vancomycin target bacterial cell walls, acyclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerase, and methylprednisolone suppresses immune response\u2014none address Plasmodium pathobiology.","clinical_manifestation":"Cerebral malaria presents with high, intermittent fevers often following tertian (every 48 h) cycle, severe headache, altered consciousness ranging from confusion to coma, seizures (15\u201320% of adults), and anemia (hemoglobin often <8 g/dL). Other features include jaundice, renal impairment, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. Anemia may be normocytic, normochromic due to hemolysis. Physical exam may reveal hepatosplenomegaly, retinal hemorrhages (\u2018malaria retinopathy\u2019), and signs of raised intracranial pressure. Pediatric presentations differ, often with febrile seizures and less pronounced anemia. In nonimmune travelers, fulminant course develops rapidly over 24\u201348 h. Prognosis without treatment is poor, with mortality >50% in adults.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing for suspected malaria includes thick and thin peripheral blood smears (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98% when performed by experienced microscopists). Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detecting HRP2 or pLDH antigens offer sensitivity 90\u201395% and specificity >90%. In suspected cerebral malaria, immediate smears and RDTs guide therapy; repeat smears every 6\u201312 h monitor parasitemia. CSF analysis is reserved to exclude co-infection if neuroinfection is uncertain; MRI is not routinely indicated acutely. WHO guidelines grade evidence for microscopy and RDTs as Level B. In resource-limited settings, RDTs allow point-of-care diagnosis with rapid turnaround. Pretest probability is high in endemic exposure with fever and AMS; negative RDT should be followed by repeat blood smear.","management_principles":"WHO 2021 guidelines recommend intravenous artesunate 2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12, and 24 h, then daily until oral therapy is feasible, then complete with artemisinin combination therapy for 3 days (e.g., artemether-lumefantrine). Artesunate reduces mortality from 22% to 15% compared with quinine (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.59\u20130.80; Class I evidence). Quinine or artesunate adjunctive drugs (e.g., clindamycin) are second-line if artesunate unavailable. Supportive care includes seizure control (IV diazepam or midazolam), management of hypoglycemia, anemia (transfusion thresholds <7 g/dL), and intracranial pressure monitoring. Corticosteroids are contraindicated. Exchange transfusion is not routinely recommended (no mortality benefit in RCTs). Pregnant women require artesunate in all trimesters; dosing is the same.","follow_up_guidelines":"After parasitemia clearance (<0.1% on smears), transition to oral therapy and discharge when afebrile for 24 h, tolerating oral intake, and with negative smears. Follow-up smears on days 7, 14, and 28 assess recrudescence. Monitor hemoglobin, renal and liver function weekly until normalization. Neurologic evaluation at 1 month to detect cognitive sequelae. No long-term residual deficits in most survivors if treated promptly. In children, follow neurodevelopmental assessments for 6\u201312 months post-recovery.","clinical_pearls":"1. In endemic areas, any febrile patient with altered mental status and anemia should be presumed to have cerebral malaria until proven otherwise\u2014initiate IV artesunate immediately. 2. Artesunate is superior to quinine in reducing mortality and should be first-line in severe malaria per WHO guidelines. 3. Peripheral blood smear remains the gold standard; repeat smears are essential to monitor parasite clearance. 4. Corticosteroids have no role and may worsen outcomes by immunosuppression. 5.

A computed tomography (CT) image was attached (showing a good aspect). The patient was febrile and had a pansystolic murmur. What is the treatment?","options":["Antibiotics","Thrombolysis","Thrombectomy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Antibiotics","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Antibiotics. In a patient with infective endocarditis presenting with acute ischemic stroke, the immediate priority is to treat the underlying infection. According to the 2015 AHA Scientific Statement on infective endocarditis (Level B evidence), prompt initiation of targeted intravenous antibiotics reduces vegetation size and prevents further septic emboli (Baddour et al. 2015).[1] Clinical trials have not supported the use of intravenous thrombolysis in infective endocarditis\u2013related stroke due to a high risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 2.2\u20137.6) and mycotic aneurysm rupture (Powers et al. 2018). Mechanical thrombectomy (option C) may be considered in large-vessel occlusions but is not the first-line acute intervention in the setting of active bacteremia and febrile endocarditis. \n\nOption B, Thrombolysis, is contraindicated. The AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines state that infective endocarditis is an absolute contraindication to tPA (Class III, Level C), given the risk of hemorrhagic conversion and mycotic aneurysm rupture documented in retrospective cohorts (12% vs. 2% in non-IE strokes).[2] \n\nOption C, Thrombectomy, while not absolutely contraindicated, is secondary to antibiotic stabilization. Limited observational data (n=32) suggest higher rates of hemorrhagic transformation (23%) when performed without prior infection control (AHA 2018). Therefore, empiric broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics tailored by blood culture results remain the initial and most critical intervention.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this question requires knowledge of infective endocarditis (IE), septic cerebral embolism, and stroke management. IE is classified in ICD-11 under \u2018BA41.0\u2013BA41.9\u2019 and fulfills Duke criteria for diagnosis: major (positive blood cultures for typical organisms, echocardiographic evidence of vegetations) and minor criteria (fever, vascular phenomena). Septic emboli to the brain arise when valvular vegetations dislodge and occlude cerebral arteries, often affecting cortical territories supplied by the middle cerebral artery. Differential diagnoses include nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation, and intracranial hemorrhage. Historically, early surgical series (1960s\u20131970s) emphasized immediate valve surgery after stroke; contemporary practice prioritizes antibiotics to sterilize vegetations and reduce aneurysm risk before any invasive procedure. Embryologically, cardiac valves derive from endocardial cushions; infection disrupts endothelial integrity, promoting vegetation formation on high-pressure surfaces. Neuroanatomical correlation involves occlusion of large vessels (e.g., M1 segment of MCA) causing contralateral hemiparesis, aphasia if dominant hemisphere, and cortical sensory loss. The pathognomonic murmur of mitral regurgitation (pansystolic, radiating to axilla) localizes the valve lesion. Understanding these concepts ensures recognition that addressing the infectious source is paramount before any reperfusion therapy.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion relies on unimpeded flow through patent arteries. In infective endocarditis, bacteria adhere to valve endothelium\u2014most commonly Staphylococcus aureus in IV drug users\u2014forming vegetations comprised of fibrin, platelets, and microorganisms. These vegetations can embolize to cerebral arteries, lodging in distal branches and causing ischemia. On a molecular level, S. aureus expresses surface adhesins (MSCRAMMs) that bind fibronectin and fibrinogen, promoting vegetation stability. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) recruited to vegetations increase proteolytic activity and weaken the arterial wall, predisposing to mycotic aneurysm formation. Cellular mechanisms include endothelial injury, blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, and activation of microglia. Acutely, occlusion causes energy failure within neurons, ion pump dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity, and cytotoxic edema. Over hours, inflammatory cell infiltration may exacerbate infarct size. Compensatory collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomoses can mitigate damage but is often insufficient with large septic emboli. In comparison, thrombotic stroke involves platelet aggregation on atherosclerotic plaque without infection, and atherosclerotic emboli lack the proteolytic/inflammatory milieu that increases hemorrhagic risk. Similarly, mechanical occlusion from pure thrombus does not generate mycotic aneurysms.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with septic cerebral emboli typically present within minutes to hours of embolization with focal neurologic deficits corresponding to the vascular territory involved. In MCA infarcts, contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, visual field deficits, and aphasia (if dominant hemisphere) are common. Approximately 20\u201330% of IE patients develop neurologic complications; one-third of these are strokes. Systemic signs include fever (>38\u00b0C in 90% of cases), chills, and new murmurs\u2014pansystolic mitral regurgitation in IV drug users. Prodromal features may include malaise or low-grade fever for days to weeks prior. Neuroimaging (noncontrast CT) initially shows hypoattenuation; diffusion-weighted MRI within 24 hours increases sensitivity to >90%. Giant mycotic aneurysms occur in up to 5% and may present later with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Untreated septic embolic stroke has a high mortality (>40% at 30 days) and risk of hemorrhagic transformation (up to 60%). Diagnostic criteria rely on Duke criteria with adjunctive imaging findings.","diagnostic_approach":"An algorithmic approach begins with noncontrast head CT to exclude intracranial hemorrhage and large established infarcts. CT sensitivity for acute ischemia within 3 hours is ~60%, but near-perfect specificity. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging increases sensitivity to >95% (Level B, AHA 2018).[2] Concurrently, draw three sets of blood cultures prior to antibiotics to maximize yield (>90% if off antibiotics). Transthoracic echocardiography (sensitivity ~75%) followed by transesophageal echocardiography (sensitivity >90% for vegetations >2\u2009mm) confirms IE. Pre-test probability for IE in febrile stroke with murmur is >20%, justifying immediate echocardiography. Vascular imaging (CT angiography) identifies vessel occlusion and mycotic aneurysms. In resource-limited settings, head CT and blood cultures guide empiric therapy when echo is unavailable. False negatives on initial imaging require repeat MRI if suspicion remains high.","management_principles":"Primary management is targeted intravenous antibiotic therapy guided by culture results. Empiric regimens for IV drug users include vancomycin plus gentamicin (AHA Class I, Level B).[1] Once susceptibilities return, narrow to anti-staphylococcal penicillin or cefazolin for methicillin-sensitive strains or continue vancomycin for MRSA. Duration is 4\u20136 weeks. Antithrombotic therapies (antiplatelets, anticoagulants, thrombolytics) are contraindicated acutely due to hemorrhagic risk (Class III, Level C).[2] Mechanical thrombectomy may be considered after 24\u201348\u2009hours of antibiotic therapy in large-vessel occlusions with NIHSS \u22656 and absence of mycotic aneurysms (Class IIb, Level C). Supportive care includes blood pressure control (permissive hypertension up to 180/105\u2009mmHg), fever management, and seizure prophylaxis if cortical involvement. Surgical consultation for valve repair is indicated in persistent bacteremia >7\u2009days, heart failure, or large mobile vegetations >10\u2009mm (Class I, Level B).[1]","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require neurologic exam every 2\u20134 hours during the first 48\u2009hours, with repeat imaging if clinical deterioration occurs. Echocardiography is repeated after completion of antibiotics to assess vegetation resolution. Blood cultures are monitored every 48 hours until negativity. Antibiotic serum levels (e.g., vancomycin troughs 15\u201320\u2009\u00b5g/mL) are checked twice weekly. Long-term follow-up includes MRI at 3\u20136 months to evaluate for mycotic aneurysms. Functional assessments (mRS, NIHSS) at discharge, 30 days, and 90 days guide rehabilitation intensity. Prophylactic dental antibiotics are recommended for high-risk patients indefinitely.","clinical_pearls":"1. Fever plus new murmur in stroke suggests septic emboli\u2014always obtain blood cultures before antibiotics to avoid false negatives. 2. Thrombolysis is contraindicated in infective endocarditis due to high risk of hemorrhagic transformation; mechanical thrombectomy can be considered after infection control. 3. Duke criteria remain the diagnostic gold standard; transesophageal echocardiography has >90% sensitivity for vegetations. 4. Empiric vancomycin plus gentamicin covers MRSA and enterococci in IV drug users; narrow therapy once cultures return. 5.

In any returning traveler from an endemic region (such as Sudan) with fever, headache, and altered mental status, cerebral malaria must be excluded promptly. Thick blood film microscopy remains the gold\u2010standard diagnostic test for Plasmodium falciparum infection, with reported sensitivities of 75\u201390% and specificities >95% when performed by experienced microscopists (WHO 2015 guidelines). Option B (\u2018MRI\u2019) is not the first\u2010line diagnostic test in suspected cerebral malaria: imaging is neither sensitive nor specific for malaria and may delay treatment initiation. MRI may show nonspecific cerebral edema but cannot confirm parasitemia or guide antimalarial therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Cerebral malaria is a severe neurologic complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection. The condition is classified under ICD\u201011 as \u2018B50.4 Cerebral malaria\u2019 and presents as part of the broader spectrum of severe malaria. The pathognomonic lesion involves sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in cerebral microvasculature. Key differential diagnoses include viral encephalitides (e.g., West Nile virus), bacterial meningitis, and other protozoal infections. Historically, the classification of malaria complications evolved from clinical descriptions by Laveran (1880s) to modern WHO definitions emphasizing neurologic involvement (1990s onward). Embryologically, cerebral vasculature derives from neural crest\u2013associated mesenchyme; postnatal expression of endothelial adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM\u20101) mediates parasite sequestration. Neurotransmitter dysregulation (glutamate excitotoxicity) and blood\u2013brain barrier dysfunction are central to development of coma and seizures.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion depends on unobstructed microvascular blood flow. In cerebral malaria, P. falciparum\u2013infected erythrocytes express PfEMP1, binding to endothelial receptors (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), causing microvascular sequestration. This leads to obstruction, local hypoxia, endothelial activation, and release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b3). The ensuing blood\u2013brain\u2010barrier breakdown permits vasogenic edema. At the cellular level, astrocyte and microglial activation further amplify inflammation. Acute parasitized\u2010erythrocyte cytoadherence and rosetting impair oxygen delivery, driving anaerobic metabolism, lactate accumulation, and neuronal injury. Chronically, persistent microvascular damage may lead to diffuse axonal injury. These mechanisms explain fever, headache, and rapid onset of confusion.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with cerebral malaria present two to three weeks after infection with high fever (>39 \u00b0C), severe headache, and varying levels of consciousness ranging from confusion to coma (Blantyre Coma Score \u22642). Seizures occur in up to 20\u201325% of adult cases and up to 60% of pediatric cases. Additional features include neck stiffness (in ~15%), retinal hemorrhages (20%), and lactic acidosis (70%). Clinical variants include hyperparasitemia (>10% erythrocytes infected) and pulmonary edema. Untreated, mortality may exceed 20% in adults and 15% in children. Survivors can have neurologic sequelae, including cognitive impairment and motor deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier testing: thick and thin blood smears for parasite detection and species identification (WHO grade A recommendation). Thick smears have a lower limit of detection (~50 parasites/\u00b5L) compared to thin smears, which allow quantification of parasitemia (>500,000 parasites/\u00b5L denotes hyperparasitemia). Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for HRP2 antigen are adjunctive but have lower sensitivity in low\u2010parasitemia cases. MRI or CT are only indicated to exclude alternative causes (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage). Lumbar puncture is generally deferred until malaria is ruled out. The pretest probability for malaria in a traveler from Sudan with fever is >50%, making microscopy the immediate priority.","management_principles":"Per WHO and AAN guidelines, intravenous artesunate (2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12, and 24 hours, then daily) is first\u2010line for cerebral malaria (Level A evidence; SEAQUAMAT trial showed 34.7% mortality reduction vs. quinine). Supportive care includes seizure control (IV lorazepam), management of hypoglycemia, and careful fluid balance to avoid cerebral edema. Exchange transfusion may be considered in hyperparasitemia (>10%) but lacks high\u2010quality trial data (Level C evidence). MRI has no role in guiding initial therapy. Monitoring hematologic parameters and renal function is essential due to risk of hemolysis and acute kidney injury.","follow_up_guidelines":"After clearance of parasitemia, follow\u2010up includes daily thick blood films until negative for two consecutive days. Neurocognitive assessment should be performed at discharge and at 3\u20136 months, as up to 10\u201315% of survivors exhibit persistent deficits.

Rifampin is the CDC-recommended first-line chemoprophylactic agent for close contacts of patients with Neisseria meningitidis infection. Clinical studies demonstrate that a four-dose regimen (600 mg orally every 12 hours for 2 days in adults; 10 mg/kg in children) achieves nasopharyngeal carriage eradication rates exceeding 95% (CDC 2015). Alternatives such as ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone are reserved for adults or special populations. No other agents match this profile of efficacy, safety, and ease of administration.\n\nNo other option is provided for direct comparison in this question.","conceptual_foundation":"Meningococcal prophylaxis targets elimination of asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis in close contacts. In ICD-11, meningococcal meningitis is classified under 1E20.0 (Neisseria meningitidis meningitis). Transmission occurs via respiratory droplets; high-risk contacts include household members, daycare attendees, and those with direct exposure to oral secretions. Rifampin acts by inhibiting the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase \u03b2-subunit (rpoB), preventing bacterial transcription. Its lipophilicity enables effective mucosal penetration. Historically, sulfonamides were used for prophylaxis but abandoned due to widespread resistance and toxicity. Conjugate vaccines (MenACWY, MenB) complement chemoprophylaxis but do not immediately eradicate carriage.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, mucosal immunity (IgA, mucociliary clearance) limits bacterial colonization. Neisseria meningitidis employs pili, opacity proteins (Opa/Opc), and factor H binding protein to adhere to nasopharyngeal epithelium and evade complement. Invasive disease follows bloodstream invasion and traversal of the blood\u2013brain barrier via transcellular or paracellular routes. Rifampin penetrates mucosal surfaces, binds the \u03b2-subunit of RNA polymerase, and halts transcription, resulting in rapid bactericidal activity. Within 24\u201348 hours of therapy, nasopharyngeal cultures convert to negative in >98% of treated carriers. Resistance through rpoB mutations is rare in prophylactic settings.","clinical_manifestation":"Close contacts of meningococcal cases are typically asymptomatic carriers. Secondary cases in unprotected contacts occur in 0.5\u20131.0%. Index cases of meningococcal meningitis present with fever (90%), nuchal rigidity (85%), headache (75%), photophobia (50%), and petechial rash (40%). Prophylaxis reduces secondary attack rates to <0.01%. Rifampin is generally well tolerated; common adverse effects include transient orange discoloration of bodily fluids and mild reversible hepatic transaminase elevations (5\u201310%).","diagnostic_approach":"Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for all close contacts within 24 hours of index case identification. Definitive diagnosis of invasive disease utilizes blood culture (sensitivity 88\u201395%), CSF culture (90%), and CSF PCR (>95%). Nasopharyngeal swab culture to detect carriage has low pretest probability (<5%) and is not recommended before prophylaxis. Prompt empirical prophylaxis without awaiting culture results is endorsed by both CDC and WHO guidelines (Grade A, Level 1 evidence).","management_principles":"Administer rifampin 600 mg PO every 12 hours for 2 days in adults or 10 mg/kg (max 600 mg) every 12 hours for 2 days in children. For pregnant women or rifampin-intolerant individuals, a single dose of ceftriaxone 250 mg IM (adults) or 125 mg IM (children) is preferred. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO single dose is an alternative for adults. Counsel patients on orange discoloration of urine, tears, and contacts lenses; monitor hepatic enzymes if extended use beyond 2 days is considered. Avoid rifampin in severe hepatic impairment and with concurrent warfarin therapy without INR monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"No routine laboratory monitoring is required for standard 2-day rifampin prophylaxis. Advise contacts to seek immediate care if fever, headache, or neck stiffness develop. Ensure quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccination at least 10 days post-exposure if not previously immunized. Document prophylaxis completion in public health records and liaise with local health departments for potential outbreak control.","clinical_pearls":"1. Rifampin is first-line for pediatric contacts; ciprofloxacin is preferred in non-pregnant adults.\n2. Administer chemoprophylaxis within 24 hours of index case notification to optimize secondary prevention.\n3. Pregnant women should receive ceftriaxone rather than rifampin to avoid teratogenic risk.\n4. Transient orange discoloration of bodily fluids is characteristic\u2014inform patients to prevent alarm.\n5. Chemoprophylaxis does not confer long-term immunity; ensure appropriate vaccination.","references":"1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Shorter courses (21 days or 14 days) provide less sustained suppression of viral replication in sensory ganglia, leading to higher rates of viral reactivation once therapy is stopped. Clinical trials of suppressive acyclovir have demonstrated a dose\u2013 and duration\u2013dependent reduction in recurrence frequency, with longer regimens correlating to lower recurrence rates.","conceptual_foundation":"HSV establishes latency in dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia after primary infection. Recurrence occurs when latent virus reactivates and travels down sensory fibers to the skin or mucosa. Suppressive antiviral therapy maintains drug levels that inhibit viral DNA polymerase, reducing both symptomatic outbreaks and asymptomatic viral shedding. The longer the duration of continuous therapy, the greater the cumulative suppression of reactivation events.","pathophysiology":"Acyclovir is a guanosine analogue that requires phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase and host kinases to its active triphosphate form, which competitively inhibits HSV DNA polymerase and terminates the DNA chain. Sustained drug levels over weeks prevent cycles of viral replication and reactivation. When therapy is shorter, intracellular acyclovir triphosphate levels fall sooner, permitting resumed viral DNA synthesis and clinical recurrence.","clinical_manifestation":"Suppressive therapy with acyclovir reduces the frequency and severity of recurrent herpetic lesions. Patients on longer-duration regimens experience fewer prodromal symptoms, shorter lesion healing times, and decreased viral shedding on culture or PCR. In contrast, short courses achieve initial lesion resolution but do not suppress later recurrences effectively.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of recurrent HSV is clinical, supported by PCR or viral culture when needed. In patients with frequent recurrences (\u22656 episodes per year), suppressive therapy is indicated. Duration of therapy is chosen based on recurrence frequency and patient tolerance; longer durations yield greater reduction in outbreaks.","management_principles":"Standard suppressive dosing of acyclovir is 400 mg orally twice daily. While most guidelines discuss 6\u201312 months of suppressive therapy, among fixed short durations, 24 days provides more sustained suppression than 21 or 14 days. Therapy must be continuous to maintain intracellular drug concentrations above the viral inhibitory threshold.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor patients monthly for adherence, renal function, and recurrence frequency. Assess for adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset or renal toxicity. Adjust duration or dose based on breakthrough recurrences or tolerance.","clinical_pearls":"1. Suppressive acyclovir must be continuous\u2014interruptions lead to rebound recurrences. 2. Longer durations of therapy correlate with lower recurrence rates. 3. Acyclovir triphosphate levels fall rapidly after stopping therapy, permitting reactivation. 4. Standard prophylactic courses are measured in months, not days; among days\u2010long regimens, the longest is best. 5. Patients with frequent recurrences benefit most from suppressive therapy.","references":"1. Corey L, Wald A, Patel R, et al.
