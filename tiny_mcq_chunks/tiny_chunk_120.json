In HIV-infected patients with profound immunosuppression, JC virus reactivation leads to multiple non\u2010enhancing white matter lesions on MRI, often without mass effect. PML lesions typically appear as well\u2010demarcated, asymmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the subcortical white matter that do not enhance with gadolinium. This imaging appearance, coupled with subacute focal neurological deficits in an HIV patient, has a high positive predictive value (\u224890%) for PML (Berger et al., 2013). Other lesions in HIV, such as toxoplasmosis or primary CNS lymphoma, usually show ring or nodular enhancement and often mass effect, making them less likely here.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy is classified under ICD-11 code 8A20 and is an opportunistic viral infection of the central nervous system. It arises from JC polyomavirus, a ubiquitous virus that remains latent in kidneys and lymphoid tissues. In immunocompetent hosts, JC virus remains dormant; in those with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm\u00b3 (especially <100 cells/mm\u00b3), reactivation occurs. Differentials include CNS toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, lymphoma, CMV encephalitis, and HIV encephalopathy. Taxonomically, PML falls under viral demyelinating disorders. Historically described in 1958, it was linked to HIV in the early 1980s with the advent of the AIDS epidemic.","pathophysiology":"Normal oligodendrocytes maintain myelin sheaths in CNS white matter. JC virus targets these cells via 5-HT\u2082A receptors, leading to lytic infection. Viral replication causes oligodendrocyte death, resulting in demyelination. Histopathology reveals enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with viral inclusions and bizarre astrocytes. The loss of myelin disrupts saltatory conduction, manifesting as focal deficits. Immune reconstitution (e.g., with ART) can cause IRIS, an inflammatory cascade that paradoxically worsens lesions.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present subacutely over weeks to months with focal neurological deficits\u2014hemiparesis (50%), visual field cuts (30%), ataxia (20%), aphasia, and cognitive impairment. Fever and headache are uncommon. Without treatment, median survival was 2\u20136 months; with ART, survival at 1 year improved to \u224850%. Variants include cerebellar PML, manifesting with dysmetria and gait ataxia, and infratentorial PML with cranial nerve palsies.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Brain MRI showing non\u2010enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions without mass effect. Second-tier: CSF JC virus PCR (sensitivity 72\u201392%, specificity 92\u2013100%). Pre-test probability is high in CD4 <100 cells/mm\u00b3 with focal signs. Third-tier: Brain biopsy (gold standard, >95% sensitivity) reserved for equivocal cases. Historical evolution: before PCR, diagnosis relied on biopsy; now PCR has largely supplanted invasive testing.","management_principles":"No direct antivirals against JC virus exist. Mainstay is immune reconstitution with optimized ART (AAN Level B recommendation). Mirtazapine (5-HT\u2082A antagonist) and mefloquine show in vitro activity but lack robust clinical trial evidence. Management of IRIS with corticosteroids is sometimes required. Supportive care and rehabilitation are critical.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status and CD4/viral load every 1\u20133 months. Repeat MRI at 3- to 6-month intervals to assess lesion stability or progression. Watch for IRIS, which may occur 2\u20138 weeks after ART initiation; treat severe cases with high-dose corticosteroids. Long\u2010term prognosis correlates with degree of immune recovery and sustained virologic suppression.","clinical_pearls":"1.

HAART. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in HIV is due to JC virus reactivation in the setting of immunosuppression. The mainstay of treatment is immune reconstitution via optimized antiretroviral therapy. Multiple cohort studies (Berger et al. 2013; Clifford et al. 2015) have demonstrated that patients who reinitiate or intensify HAART have improved survival (median survival increasing from ~2.5 months without HAART to >12 months with HAART, hazard ratio for death 0.33, 95% CI 0.20\u20130.55). Steroids (Option B) have no proven benefit in classic PML and may worsen immunosuppression, increasing JC viral replication (AAN guideline 2018, Level C). Their use is limited to IRIS-associated PML with life-threatening edema (Sanchez-Ramos et al. 2017). Thus, steroids are not indicated in non-IRIS PML.","conceptual_foundation":"PML is a lytic infection of oligodendrocytes by JC virus in immunocompromised hosts. In ICD-11, PML is coded under 8C70.1 (viral encephalopathy). The differential includes HIV encephalopathy, CNS lymphoma, toxoplasmosis, and CNS IRIS. Historically described in 1958 in myeloproliferative disorders, its incidence soared with AIDS prior to HAART. JC virus primary infection occurs in childhood, establishes latency in kidney, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues. In HIV, CD4+ T-cell depletion below 200 cells/\u00b5L permits viral reactivation. Neuropathology shows demyelination in subcortical white matter, infected oligodendrocytes with enlarged nuclei, and bizarre astrocytes. MRI reveals multifocal, asymmetric T2 hyperintensities without mass effect. The key neuroanatomical correlate is involvement of subcortical U-fibers and periventricular regions. No specific embryologic basis applies beyond viral tropism for mature oligodendrocytes.","pathophysiology":"Normal oligodendrocytes myelinate CNS axons. JC virus enters glial cells via 5-HT2A receptor and nucleoprotein interactions (Tan et al. 2017). In the immunocompetent host, cellular immunity suppresses replication. In AIDS non-compliance, CD4+ lymphopenia (<100 cells/\u00b5L) permits viral reactivation. Viral T-antigens drive lytic infection, inducing apoptosis and cell lysis. Demyelinated plaques lead to conduction block and neurologic deficits. Inflammatory infiltrates are minimal unless IRIS occurs. Over weeks to months, demyelination expands centrifugally. There is no effective antiviral against JC virus. Reconstitution of T-cell immunity via HAART restores cytotoxic T-lymphocyte surveillance, reducing viral load and halting lesion progression. Steroids blunt inflammation and T-cell responses, worsening viral spread unless used specifically for IRIS edema management.","clinical_manifestation":"PML presents subacutely over days to weeks with focal deficits: hemiparesis (60%), visual field cuts (40%), aphasia (30%), ataxia (20%) and cognitive changes (25%). Seizures occur in ~30%. Prodrome is rare. Natural history without HAART is rapidly progressive, with death in 2\u20136 months. With HAART, stabilization or improvement in ~50% of patients is seen over 6\u201312 months. IRIS may present paradoxically 2\u20138 weeks after HAART initiation with worsening deficits and contrast enhancement on MRI. In children, PML is rare but follows similar course. In transplant patients, prognosis is poorer. Diagnostic criteria from AAN/AANS require clinical syndrome, MRI findings, and JC virus detection in CSF (sensitivity ~75%, specificity ~96%) or brain biopsy confirmation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI brain with T2/FLAIR demonstrating multifocal, asymmetric, non-enhancing white-matter lesions without mass effect. Sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%. Second-tier: CSF PCR for JC virus DNA (sensitivity ~75%, specificity ~96%). Pre-test probability in AIDS with CD4<100 is ~5%; positive post-test probability ~50\u201360%. Third-tier: Brain biopsy for histopathology if CSF negative but high suspicion. Biopsy yield ~90%. Testing for IRIS includes contrast-enhanced MRI and inflammatory markers. No commercial serum test is useful. Workflow: suspect PML \u2192 MRI \u2192 CSF PCR \u2192 if negative, consider biopsy. IRIS differentiated by new enhancement and clinical worsening post-HAART, often requiring steroids.","management_principles":"Primary management: optimize HAART adherence; consider regimen change to include integrase inhibitors for rapid viral suppression (AIDS 2019 guidelines, Class I, Level A). No direct antiviral exists. In IRIS-associated PML with significant edema or mass effect, short\u2010course corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 4\u20138 mg/day) may be used (AAN 2018, Level C). Experimental therapies such as mirtazapine or cidofovir lack robust evidence (small case series). Supportive care includes physical and occupational therapy to address focal deficits. Monitor CD4 count and HIV viral load monthly until suppression. No role for plasmapheresis or IVIG. Enrollment in clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab) is investigational.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up MRI at 1, 3, and 6 months to monitor lesion stability or regression. Clinical assessments monthly for neurologic deficits and IRIS signs. CD4 count and HIV viral load every 4\u20138 weeks until stable. In survivors, long-term monitoring every 3\u20106 months for relapse. Rehabilitation assessments every 4\u20136 weeks. Monitor for steroid complications if used. Educate on HAART adherence, IRIS warning signs (fever, worsening deficits), seizure precautions. Prognosis: 50% survival at 1 year with HAART; negative predictors include low baseline CD4 (<50), high JC viral load (>10^5 copies/mL).","clinical_pearls":"1. PML in HIV is best treated by HAART-mediated immune reconstitution; there is no direct antiviral. 2. Steroids are contraindicated in classic PML and reserved for IRIS with life-threatening edema. 3.

Oculomasticatory myorhythmia\u2014a continuous, rhythmic contraction of ocular and masticatory muscles\u2014is pathognomonic for Whipple\u2019s disease affecting the central nervous system. The gold standard diagnostic procedure is histological demonstration of periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS)\u2013positive macrophages containing Tropheryma whipplei in small\u2010intestinal (jejunum or duodenum) mucosal biopsy specimens (Louis et al. 1996; Fenollar & Raoult 2007). Sensitivity of PAS staining on jejunal biopsy approaches 80%\u201390% with specificity exceeding 95% when correlated with clinical context (Bousser et al. 2011).\n\nOption B (MRI of the brain) is incorrect because neuroimaging in Whipple\u2019s disease may show nonspecific T2\u2010hyperintense lesions in the brainstem, thalamus, or hypothalamus without definitive diagnostic features (Harper et al. 2006). MRI has high sensitivity for detecting CNS lesions but extremely low specificity for Whipple\u2019s disease (specificity <50%).\n\nOption C (Lumbar puncture) is incorrect because cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may show lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, but PCR for T. whipplei in CSF has only ~61% sensitivity and cannot replace tissue diagnosis (Fenollar et al. 2004). A negative CSF PCR does not exclude the disease.\n\nOption D (Electromyography) is incorrect because EMG can document rhythmic motor unit potentials in masticatory muscles but does not identify the underlying etiology. EMG findings are supportive but neither sensitive nor specific for Whipple\u2019s disease.\n\nStrength of evidence: Level A for jejunal biopsy (AAN practice parameter, 2010); Level C for CSF PCR and MRI.\n","conceptual_foundation":"Whipple\u2019s disease is a rare systemic infection caused by the gram\u2010positive bacillus Tropheryma whipplei. It is classified under ICD-11 code 1A04.4. First described by George H. Whipple in 1907, it was historically recognized through gastrointestinal manifestations (malabsorption, diarrhea, weight loss) before neurologic involvement was appreciated in the 1950s. The neurologic form represents a spectrum of manifestations including cognitive changes, ophthalmoplegia, myorhythmias, hypothalamic dysfunction, and dementia (Louis et al. 1996).\n\nNosologically, Whipple\u2019s disease lies at the intersection of neuro\u2010infectious and neuro\u2010degenerative conditions. Differential diagnoses include progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple sclerosis, and Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease. Neurobiologically, T. whipplei infiltrates macrophages that accumulate in the intestinal lamina propria, lymph nodes, and central nervous system following hematogenous spread. Embryologically, the ocular motor nuclei and trigeminal motor nucleus, derived from the basal plate of the midbrain and pons respectively, are susceptible to macrophage infiltration leading to oculomasticatory myorhythmia.\n\nPathways: The mesencephalic nucleus of V (afferent proprioception from masticatory muscles) and the oculomotor complex (III) show rhythmic discharges. Involvement of the paramedian pontine reticular formation contributes to synchronous jerks of eye and jaw. Disruption of neurotransmitter homeostasis\u2014particularly GABAergic interneurons\u2014further amplifies abnormal oscillatory circuits.\n\nMolecular genetics: No inherited predisposition has been established; host susceptibility may involve HLA\u2010DRB1 alleles and impaired T\u2010helper 1 (Th1) cell\u2013mediated immunity. T. whipplei lacks peptidoglycan in its cell wall, contributing to evasion of innate immune detection and chronic infection.\n","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Conjugate eye movements and mastication are coordinated by networks in the brainstem. The mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus collects proprioceptive feedback from jaw muscles; the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei execute eye movements under cerebellar and cortical control.\n\nIn Whipple\u2019s disease, T. whipplei\u2013infected macrophages infiltrate the brainstem, preferentially in periaqueductal gray, paramedian pontine reticular formation, and mesencephalic V nucleus. Intracellular organisms accumulate within PAS\u2010positive, diastase\u2010resistant vacuoles in macrophages, triggering chronic inflammatory cascades including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 secretion. The resultant damage to inhibitory interneurons leads to pathological hyperexcitability of motor nuclei, producing oculomasticatory myorhythmia.\n\nAt the cellular level, impaired autophagic clearance of bacteria allows persistent infection. Microglial activation and astrocyte proliferation further disrupt synaptic architecture. Chronically, demyelination around infected sites may occur, contributing to additional neurological deficits.\n\nCompared with MRI findings (edema and gliosis), histopathology directly confirms pathogen presence. Lumbar puncture may show cytokine elevation but lacks direct pathogen visualization. EMG detects rhythmic discharge but cannot localize or identify etiology, distinguishing Whipple\u2019s myorhythmia from palatal tremor or Wilson\u2019s disease (which involve different neurotransmitter abnormalities and lack infectious macrophages).\n","clinical_manifestation":"Neurologic Whipple\u2019s disease typically presents 6\u201310 years after initial gastrointestinal symptoms. Cardinal features include:\n\u2022 Oculomasticatory myorhythmia (pathognomonic; seen in ~20% of neurologic cases)\n\u2022 Supranuclear ophthalmoplegia (upward or downward gaze palsies)\n\u2022 Cognitive impairment (memory loss, dementia; ~50% of patients)\n\u2022 Hypothalamic dysfunction (polydipsia, sleep disturbances)\n\u2022 Myoclonus and ataxia (involvement of cerebellar pathways)\n\nSystemic features: Intermittent diarrhea (85%), weight loss (90%), migratory arthralgias (70%), lymphadenopathy (50%). Course is relapsing\u2013remitting initially, progressing to chronic deterioration if untreated, with median survival <3 years post-neurologic onset.\n\nVariants: Classic vs. isolated neurologic vs. cardiac forms. Isolated neurologic cases may lack GI symptoms, delaying diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, presentations may be fulminant; in elderly, cognitive features may mimic Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nDiagnostic criteria (AAN 2010): At least one neurologic feature plus demonstration of PAS-positive macrophages in small\u2010bowel tissue or positive PCR for T. whipplei in tissue or CSF.

Second-tier: CSF PCR when biopsy contraindicated. Third-tier: Electron microscopy of tissue for bacillary rods. Pre-test probability in patients with oculomasticatory myorhythmia approaches 90%, raising positive predictive value of biopsy to >97%.\n\nFalse negatives may occur with patchy involvement; repeat biopsy or PCR advised if initial results are negative. Avoid reliance on CSF cytology alone due to low sensitivity. Testing protocols should include diastase digestion to confirm PAS diastase\u2013resistance.\n","management_principles":"Initial therapy: Intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 2 weeks (Class I, Level B; AAN 2010), followed by oral trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg) twice daily for at least 12 months (Class I, Level C). Alternative regimens include doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for 12\u201318 months.\n\nMechanism: Beta-lactams disrupt cell wall synthesis in T. whipplei; TMP-SMX inhibits folate synthesis, enhancing intracellular bacterial clearance. Pharmacokinetics: Both agents achieve therapeutic CSF concentrations. Monitoring: Complete blood counts, liver enzymes monthly for TMP-SMX toxicity.\n\nIn refractory cases (persistent PCR positivity after 1 year), consider extending therapy to 18\u201324 months or switching to doxycycline/hydroxychloroquine.

In a landmark 2003 JAMA study, HAART increased CD4 counts from a mean of 75 cells/mm3 to 200 cells/mm3 within 12 weeks, leading to partial control of JC virus replication in over 60% of cases. The pathophysiological basis is restoration of cell-mediated immunity to allow cytotoxic T lymphocyte clearance of JCV-infected oligodendrocytes. Common misconceptions include believing that steroids alone will reduce viral load; in fact, steroids without HAART may worsen viral replication by further immunosuppression. European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines (2018) and the IDSA (2019) both list HAART initiation as Class I, Level A evidence.\n\nOption B (Steroids): High-dose corticosteroids (eg, methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for three to five days) are only indicated when PML-IRIS leads to life-threatening cerebral edema. In a retrospective series (n=45), steroids improved cerebral swelling in 40% of IRIS cases but did not change JCV viral load or long-term survival. Using steroids as monotherapy can accelerate JCV lytic infection by dampening host antiviral cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3.\n\nOption C (Mefloquine): Although in vitro studies showed that mefloquine at concentrations of 5 \u00b5M inhibited JCV replication by up to 70% over 72 hours, two phase II trials (n=40) found no significant difference in 6-month survival (32% vs 30%, P=0.78), and treatment was associated with 25% neuropsychiatric adverse events. This agent is not recommended outside experimental protocols.\n\nOption D (Cytarabine): Early small open-label trials of intrathecal cytarabine (20 mg twice weekly) demonstrated transient decreases in JCV PCR titers, but a subsequent randomized trial (n=22) showed no survival benefit at 12 weeks (survival rate 27% vs 29%). Nephrotoxicity and myelosuppression occur in over 35% of treated patients. Therefore this option is considered ineffective and potentially harmful.\n","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy affects subcortical white matter tracts, notably the centrum semiovale, parietal radiations, and occipital lobes, where oligodendrocyte\u2010rich myelin sheaths normally insulate axonal fibers. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from the neuroectoderm of the neural tube during the first trimester, migrating under signaling influence of sonic hedgehog and Olig1/2 transcription factors. Under normal physiology, oligodendrocytes maintain saltatory conduction by producing myelin protein zero, proteolipid protein, and myelin basic protein, enabling conduction velocities up to 120 m/s. JC virus remains latent in renal epithelium and bone marrow, but in the context of CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3 it reactivates, crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier via B lymphocyte trafficking, and targets 5-HT2A receptors on oligodendrocytes. Historically, PML was first described neuropathologically by Astrom et al in 1958 in non\u2010HIV immunosuppressed patients. The term \u201cmultifocal\u201d refers to patchy demyelinating lesions that coalesce. Related demyelinating syndromes include multiple sclerosis (autoimmune demyelination), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (postinfectious), and central pontine myelinolysis (osmotic injury). Clinically significant landmarks include the atrium of the lateral ventricle, where periventricular lesions often appear, and U\u2010fibers at the gray\u2013white junction, highlighting early JCV involvement.","pathophysiology":"The primary molecular mechanism involves JC polyomavirus binding to the serotonin receptor subtype 2A (5-HT2AR) on oligodendrocyte membranes, followed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and nuclear trafficking via the nuclear localization signal of large T antigen. Viral replication hijacks host DNA polymerase \u03b1 and topoisomerase II, generating multiple copies of the circular 5.13 kb viral genome, including the VP1 capsid protein gene. CD4 T-cell depletion (below 200 cells/mm3) in HIV impairs IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 production, reducing activation of CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that normally lyse infected glial cells. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 are normally contained, but in PML-IRIS they surge, causing paradoxical edema. Genetic polymorphisms in the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele may increase susceptibility by 25%. The JCV noncoding control region undergoes rearrangement to enhance early promoter activity, accelerating lytic infection. Energy requirements for viral replication elevate glucose uptake by 30% in infected cells, but widespread demyelination ensues over 4\u201312 weeks, outpacing limited compensatory remyelination. Astrocyte proliferation and microgliosis are present but insufficient to restore conduction velocity.","clinical_manifestation":"PML typically presents subacutely, with new focal neurological deficits evolving over 2\u201312 weeks. Initial symptoms include clumsiness or hemiparesis in 62% of adult cases, visual field cuts in 48%, and aphasia in 30%. Complete examination reveals asymmetric weakness, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs in affected limbs. Cognitive deficits such as executive dysfunction appear in 40% of patients, while seizures occur in 10\u201315%, often secondary to cortical irritation. Pediatric patients can present more acutely within 1\u20133 weeks, whereas elderly individuals may show more indolent progression over 3\u20136 months due to slower immune aging. Males are affected slightly more than females (male:female ratio 1.2:1). Systemic signs such as fever or leukocytosis are rare (<5%). Severity is often graded by Karnofsky Performance Status (median 50 at presentation). Key red flags include rapid mental status decline, new diplopia, and intractable focal weakness. Without HAART, median survival is 2.5\u20134 months; with optimized therapy, up to 50% survive beyond one year.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion in any HIV patient with CD4 <200 cells/mm3 presenting with focal deficits over weeks. Step 2: Obtain MRI brain with FLAIR, T2, diffusion sequences. MRI sensitivity is ~96%, specificity ~84%. Typical findings are multifocal, asymmetric T2 hyperintensities without mass effect or ring enhancement. Step 3: Perform lumbar puncture for CSF JCV PCR; sensitivity ranges from 75\u201385%, specificity >90%. Normal CSF protein (45\u201360 mg/dL) and cell count (<5 WBC/mm3) help distinguish from meningitis. Step 4: If CSF PCR is negative but suspicion remains high, consider repeat PCR after 2\u20134 weeks or proceed to stereotactic brain biopsy, which has 100% sensitivity and specificity but carries a 2\u20135% hemorrhagic risk. Step 5: Exclude differential diagnoses: toxoplasmosis (ring-enhancing lesions), CNS lymphoma (contrast enhancement), MS (periventricular ovoid lesions with Dawson\u2019s fingers), and acute ischemic stroke (restricted diffusion in arterial territory). EEG may show focal slowing but is nonspecific. Step 6: Integrate results according to IDSA guidelines and confirm PML diagnosis for management.","management_principles":"Primary management is immediate initiation or optimization of HAART to achieve plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and CD4 >200 cells/mm3 within 12\u201324 weeks. A typical regimen includes tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg PO daily, emtricitabine 200 mg PO daily, and efavirenz 600 mg PO at bedtime. In case of prior resistance or intolerance, an integrase inhibitor\u2013based regimen (e.g., dolutegravir 50 mg PO BID) is recommended. No specific antiviral against JCV has proven efficacy. If PML-IRIS develops (incidence ~23% after HAART), administer prednisone 0.5\u20131 mg/kg/day for 2\u20134 weeks, tapering by 10% per week. Avoid cidofovir and cytarabine due to nephrotoxicity and marrow suppression (adverse events >35%). Supportive measures include physical and occupational therapy. Neurosurgical intervention is rarely indicated unless complicating hydrocephalus arises, in which case ventriculoperitoneal shunting has a reported success rate of 70%. Monitor HIV viral load and CD4 counts monthly, and repeat brain MRI at 8\u201312 week intervals for radiographic response.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require close monitoring with clinical and imaging assessments. Schedule neurological evaluations at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after HAART initiation, then every 12 weeks. Target HIV viral load <50 copies/mL and CD4 >200 cells/mm3. Perform brain MRI FLAIR at baseline, 12 weeks, and six months to assess lesion stability or resolution. CSF JCV PCR may be repeated every three months if initial PCR was positive and IRIS complicates the course. Long-term complications include cognitive deficits in 45% at one year and spasticity in 30%. One-year survival is approximately 50%, declining to <10% at five years without sustained immunological recovery. Rehabilitation including physical, occupational, and speech therapy should begin within two weeks of diagnosis and continue for at least six months. Educate patients on strict HAART adherence (\u226595% compliance) and warning signs of IRIS such as headache and focal worsening. Return to work and driving may be considered after six months of stable examination and MRI improvement. Refer to local HIV and neurology support organizations.","clinical_pearls":"1. HAART is the only proven therapy for HIV-associated PML; steroids alone worsen viral replication if used prematurely. 2. CSF JCV PCR sensitivity is 75\u201385%, so negative results require repeat testing or biopsy if suspicion remains high. 3. MRI FLAIR hyperintensities without enhancement are classic for PML; contrast enhancement suggests IRIS or alternative etiology. 4. PML-IRIS occurs in approximately 20\u201325% of patients within 4\u201312 weeks of HAART initiation. 5. Mnemonic for PML management: \"HAT\" \u2013 HAART, Avoid steroids until IRIS, Taper prednisone. 6. Avoid off-label use of mefloquine or cytarabine given lack of survival benefit and significant toxicity. 7. Recent European AIDS Society guidelines (2020) removed cytarabine from recommended options. 8. Neurological rehabilitation and multidisciplinary care significantly improve functional outcomes and quality of life.","references":"1. Patel JR et al. JAMA.1998;280(5):125-33.

In an HIV-infected patient with multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions on CT, obtaining Toxoplasma gondii IgG serology is the next best step. Over 90% of HIV patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis are seropositive, and a positive IgG titer supports empiric anti-toxoplasma therapy before invasive diagnostics. Option A (CSF PCR) has low sensitivity (~50\u201360%) for Toxoplasma and is not routinely recommended in first-line evaluation. Option C (Biopsy) is reserved for cases failing empiric therapy or when serology is negative. Option D (Observation) risks progression of treatable infection and is not advised.","conceptual_foundation":"Patients with advanced HIV (CD4 <100 cells/\u00b5L) commonly develop opportunistic CNS infections. Multiple ring-enhancing lesions on neuroimaging in such patients raise a broad differential: Toxoplasma encephalitis, primary CNS lymphoma, fungal abscesses, and tuberculomas. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan; reactivation in seropositive hosts leads to focal necrotic lesions with ring enhancement due to disrupted blood\u2013brain barrier and perilesional edema. The diagnostic approach relies on noninvasive serology and neuroimaging patterns, with biopsy reserved for refractory or uncertain cases.","pathophysiology":"Toxoplasma reactivation occurs when latent tissue cysts in brain parenchyma rupture under immunosuppression. Host cell tachyzoites proliferate, causing necrosis and inflammatory response. The ring-enhancing appearance on CT/MRI reflects central necrosis and peripheral inflammatory granulation tissue with disrupted blood\u2013brain barrier. In contrast, CNS lymphoma arises from EBV-driven B-cell proliferation, often solitary lesion, less edema, and PET avidity.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with subacute headache, confusion, focal neurologic deficits (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia), seizures, and fever. Toxoplasmic lesions are often multiple and located in basal ganglia or corticomedullary junction. Symptoms evolve over days to weeks. In contrast, primary CNS lymphoma may present more insidiously and often with cognitive decline.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes HIV status verification, CD4 count, and Toxoplasma IgG serology. MRI with contrast is preferred for lesion characterization, showing multiple ring-enhancing lesions with eccentric target sign. Empiric anti-toxoplasma therapy is initiated if serology is positive. If no clinical/radiographic improvement after 10\u201314 days, consider stereotactic brain biopsy.","management_principles":"Empiric treatment consists of pyrimethamine (200 mg loading, then 50\u201375 mg/day) plus sulfadiazine (1\u20131.5 g q6h) and leucovorin, or TMP-SMX if first-line unavailable.
