[{"question_number":"3","question":"Impaired immediate recall is associated with lesions of:","options":["Prefrontal cortex","Medial temporal","Occipital","Mediodorsal thalamus"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Prefrontal cortex","subspecialty":"Other/Unclassified","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Immediate recall taps working memory, mediated by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Lesions here (Option A) produce digit span forward/backward deficits and impaired span tasks (D\u2019Esposito et al., Cereb Cortex 2016). The medial temporal lobe (Option B) subserves encoding and consolidation rather than immediate maintenance. Occipital cortex (Option C) processes visual information. Mediodorsal thalamus (Option D) contributes to attention and executive circuits but is not the primary substrate for immediate recall.","conceptual_foundation":"Working memory is the capacity to hold and manipulate information over seconds. The Baddeley and Hitch model assigns the central executive to the DLPFC. Immediate recall tasks engage this circuit without requiring transfer to long-term storage (DSM-5 TR Memory Disorders section). The medial temporal lobes are engaged when encoding into durable representations beyond immediate needs.","pathophysiology":"DLPFC pyramidal neurons exhibit persistent firing dependent on NMDA receptor currents. Lesions disrupt recurrent excitation, abolishing the ability to maintain neural ensembles representing current information. In stroke or TBI targeting DLPFC, patients lose immediate recall capacity despite intact sensory inputs and long-term memory retrieval.","clinical_manifestation":"DLPFC lesions present with reduced digit span (normal span\u2009\u2248\u20096 digits; lesion\u2009<\u20094), poor performance on n-back tasks, and normal recognition memory. Patients may demonstrate concrete thinking and impaired planning, highlighting executive dysfunction beyond pure memory impairment.","diagnostic_approach":"Neuropsychological battery: Digit Span Test, Spatial Span Test, and story immediate recall. Structural MRI for focal DLPFC lesions. Functional imaging (fMRI) shows hypoactivation during working memory tasks. Exclusion of medial temporal dysfunction by intact delayed recall and recognition indices.","management_principles":"Cognitive rehabilitation: targeted working memory training improves span by 1\u20132 digits (small RCTs). External aids (note-taking, alarms) compensate for deficits. Pharmacologic augmentation with dopaminergic agents (e.g., methylphenidate) shows mixed results and is off-label.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat neuropsychological assessment every 6\u201312 months to monitor recovery or decline. fMRI may demonstrate compensatory activation in contralateral prefrontal regions. Adjust rehabilitation strategies based on progress.","clinical_pearls":"1. Digit span forward assesses passive maintenance; backward requires manipulation. 2. Immediate recall deficits with preserved delayed recall indicate DLPFC dysfunction. 3. Differentiate from medial temporal amnesia by spared recognition. 4. Traumatic injury often affects bilateral DLPFC in diffuse axonal injury. 5. Dopamine modulation can transiently enhance working memory in DLPFC lesions.","references":"1.

Proximal defects (NAGS or CPS1 deficiency) block the first step of the cycle, causing ammonia buildup and low downstream intermediates including citrulline. Distal defects (ASS or ASL deficiency) cause elevated citrulline or argininosuccinate, respectively. No other category fits this biochemical pattern.","conceptual_foundation":"The urea cycle detoxifies ammonia by converting it to urea via the mitochondrial enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinate lyase, and arginase. Plasma amino acid analysis differentiates proximal (low citrulline) from distal (high citrulline) defects.","pathophysiology":"In CPS1 or NAGS deficiency, carbamoyl phosphate production is impaired, preventing the formation of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine. This leads to accumulation of ammonia, which crosses the blood-brain barrier, causing astrocyte swelling, impaired excitatory neurotransmission, and potential cerebral edema.","clinical_manifestation":"Neonatal onset presents within 48 hours of life with poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and coma. Late\u2010onset forms present in adolescence or adulthood with protein\u2010triggered encephalopathy, psychiatric symptoms, or chronic headaches. Laboratory findings show plasma ammonia >150 \u00b5mol/L and citrulline <5 \u00b5mol/L.","diagnostic_approach":"Measure plasma ammonia, plasma amino acids, and urinary orotic acid (normal in CPS1 deficiency). Genetic testing confirms CPS1 or NAGS mutations. Newborn screening may detect elevated glutamine or abnormal citrulline levels.","management_principles":"Acute hyperammonemia: ammonia scavengers (sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate), intravenous arginine, and hemodialysis if ammonia >200 \u00b5mol/L. Chronic management: protein restriction, oral nitrogen scavengers (phenylbutyrate), and citrulline or arginine supplementation. Liver transplantation is curative in refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Frequent monitoring of ammonia, amino acids, growth, and neurodevelopment. Annual neuropsychological testing. Adjust dietary protein intake and medications based on biochemical monitoring.","clinical_pearls":"1. Low citrulline with hyperammonemia indicates proximal urea cycle defect. 2. Normal urinary orotic acid differentiates CPS1 from OTC deficiency. 3. Sodium phenylbutyrate provides alternative ammonia excretion. 4. Rapid dialysis is indicated when ammonia exceeds 200 \u00b5mol/L. 5. Genetic counseling is essential for recurrence risk.","references":"1. Summar ML, et al. Urea cycle disorders.
