In comatose post\u2013cardiac arrest patients undergoing hypothermia and sedation, SSEPs performed \u226572 hours after return to normothermia provide highly specific prognostic information. Bilateral absence of the N20 cortical potential has specificity >95% for poor neurological outcome (Sandroni et al., Intensive Care Med 2014;40:181\u2013197). Option A, brain MRI with contrast, is not recommended acutely due to patient instability, low early sensitivity for prognostication, and potential nephrotoxicity of contrast. Option B, EEG, though useful for detecting seizures and background suppression, has lower specificity (80\u201390%) for poor outcome and can be affected by sedation.

In a 70-year-old male, changes on MRI may reflect watershed infarcts, especially if the imaging shows bilateral cortical ribbon or wedge-shaped infarcts at the junction of major arterial territories. These regions are particularly vulnerable to ischemia due to their reliance on collateral circulation. \n\n### B) Cardioembolic\nCardioembolic strokes result from emboli originating from the heart, often due to conditions such as atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, or myocardial infarction. These strokes typically present as territorial infarcts in a single vascular distribution, which would not correlate with the bilateral cortical changes suggested in the MRI findings of this patient. \n\n### C) Small Vessel Disease\nSmall vessel disease, often associated with chronic hypertension and diabetes, leads to deep lacunar infarcts, characterized by small, localized areas of ischemia in the basal ganglia or white matter. MRI findings here would not present as wedge-shaped or ribbon-shaped infarcts, making this option less likely in the context of the described MRI changes.\n\n### D) Vasculitis\nVasculitis can cause multifocal ischemic events due to inflammation of blood vessels, potentially leading to stroke. However, the pattern of infarction typically seen in vasculitis would not align with the watershed pattern. Instead, vasculitis tends to produce more diffuse and irregular infarcts rather than the well-defined watershed infarcts seen in this scenario.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nWatershed areas in the brain are regions that lie at the borders of two major cerebral arterial territories (anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery). These areas are particularly susceptible to ischemia during states of systemic hypotension, such as during severe blood loss, cardiac arrest, or significant dehydration. \n\nWatershed infarcts are classified into two main types: cortical watershed infarcts occur along the surface of the brain, while subcortical watershed infarcts occur deeper in the brain, typically between deep and superficial arterial supply. Understanding the vascular anatomy and hemodynamics of the brain is crucial in recognizing the clinical implications of watershed infarcts.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiological basis of watershed infarcts involves inadequate blood flow to the watershed areas due to systemic hypotension or hypoperfusion. When perfusion pressure drops, these border zones become the first areas to suffer from ischemia because they are furthest from the direct arterial supply and rely heavily on collateral blood flow.\n\nIn conditions such as shock, hypovolemia, or cardiac dysfunction, the mean arterial pressure may fall below the critical threshold required to maintain adequate perfusion to these areas. Consequently, the neurons in these regions begin to undergo necrosis due to the lack of oxygen and nutrients, leading to infarction.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nPatients with watershed infarcts may present with a variety of neurological symptoms depending on the specific areas affected. Common clinical manifestations include:\n\n- Cognitive Impairment: Often, patients may experience changes in mental status or confusion due to involvement of the watershed areas associated with frontal and parietal lobes.\n- Motor Deficits: If the infarction affects the motor areas, patients may present with weakness or paralysis, particularly affecting the proximal muscles (often referred to as \"man-in-a-barrel\" syndrome).\n- Sensory Loss: Patients may experience sensory deficits corresponding to the areas impacted by the infarction.\n- Visual Disturbances: If the posterior watershed areas are involved, visual field defects may be a symptom.\n\nThe symptoms can be subtle and may develop over hours to days, making timely recognition and intervention critical.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe primary diagnostic tool for assessing watershed infarcts is MRI of the brain. MRI findings may reveal:\n\n- Bilateral Cortical Infarcts: Typically seen as wedge-shaped or ribbon-like hyperintensities on T2-weighted images.\n- Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI): Can show early ischemic changes, highlighting areas of restricted diffusion in the watershed regions.\n\nAdditional investigations may include:\n\n- CT Angiography: To evaluate the cerebral vasculature for any significant stenosis, occlusions, or vascular malformations.\n- Echocardiography: To assess for potential sources of emboli in the case of suspected cardioembolic events.\n- Blood Tests: Including complete blood count, electrolytes, coagulation profiles, and markers of inflammation in cases of suspected vasculitis.\n\nDifferential diagnosis should include other types of strokes, such as embolic, thrombotic, and those caused by small vessel disease, as well as non-vascular causes of similar symptoms.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nThe management of watershed infarction largely revolves around addressing the underlying cause of the hypoperfusion, as well as providing supportive care:\n\n- Acute Management: Ensuring adequate blood pressure and perfusion is critical. In cases of hypotension, intravenous fluids and vasopressors may be required to stabilize hemodynamics.\n- Rehabilitation: Comprehensive rehabilitation involving physical, occupational, and speech therapy is crucial for recovery and improving functional outcomes.\n- Secondary Prevention: Addressing risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia through medications and lifestyle modifications is essential in preventing future strokes.\n\nSpecific treatments may vary depending on the identified etiology of the watershed infarct and the patient's overall clinical condition.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nLong-term follow-up for patients with watershed infarction should focus on:\n\n- Neurological Assessment: Regular evaluation of neurological function and cognitive status.\n- Risk Factor Management: Continuous management of vascular risk factors is crucial, including regular monitoring of blood pressure, glucose levels, and lipid profiles.\n- Rehabilitation Progress: Ongoing assessment of rehabilitation progress and adjustment of therapy as needed to enhance recovery.\n- Monitoring for Complications: Patients should be monitored for potential complications such as recurrent strokes, seizures, and depression, which are common among stroke survivors.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Memory Aid: To recall watershed infarcts, think of \"border zones\" and \"hypoperfusion\" \u2013 areas that are last to receive blood flow and first to suffer during systemic drops in perfusion.\n- Recognition: When faced with a patient showing bilateral cortical symptoms, always consider watershed infarcts, especially in the elderly or those with significant vascular risk factors.\n- Intervention: Immediate management of blood pressure and perfusion status can significantly impact outcomes in patients presenting with watershed infarcts.\n\n## 9.

Follow-up Guidelines\n\nLong-term follow-up for patients with watershed infarction should focus on:\n\n- Neurological Assessment: Regular evaluation of neurological function and cognitive status.\n- Risk Factor Management: Continuous management of vascular risk factors is crucial, including regular monitoring of blood pressure, glucose levels, and lipid profiles.\n- Rehabilitation Progress: Ongoing assessment of rehabilitation progress and adjustment of therapy as needed to enhance recovery.\n- Monitoring for Complications: Patients should be monitored for potential complications such as recurrent strokes, seizures, and depression, which are common among stroke survivors.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Memory Aid: To recall watershed infarcts, think of \"border zones\" and \"hypoperfusion\" \u2013 areas that are last to receive blood flow and first to suffer during systemic drops in perfusion.\n- Recognition: When faced with a patient showing bilateral cortical symptoms, always consider watershed infarcts, especially in the elderly or those with significant vascular risk factors.\n- Intervention: Immediate management of blood pressure and perfusion status can significantly impact outcomes in patients presenting with watershed infarcts.\n\n## 9. References","diagnostic_approach":"The primary diagnostic tool for assessing watershed infarcts is MRI of the brain. MRI findings may reveal:\n\n- Bilateral Cortical Infarcts: Typically seen as wedge-shaped or ribbon-like hyperintensities on T2-weighted images.\n- Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI): Can show early ischemic changes, highlighting areas of restricted diffusion in the watershed regions.\n\nAdditional investigations may include:\n\n- CT Angiography: To evaluate the cerebral vasculature for any significant stenosis, occlusions, or vascular malformations.\n- Echocardiography: To assess for potential sources of emboli in the case of suspected cardioembolic events.\n- Blood Tests: Including complete blood count, electrolytes, coagulation profiles, and markers of inflammation in cases of suspected vasculitis.\n\nDifferential diagnosis should include other types of strokes, such as embolic, thrombotic, and those caused by small vessel disease, as well as non-vascular causes of similar symptoms.\n\n## 6.

Watershed infarcts occur in border zones between cerebral arterial distributions during systemic hypotension or hypoperfusion. Cardioembolic strokes typically produce territorial infarcts in a single vascular distribution; small vessel disease causes deep lacunar infarctions; vasculitis can cause multifocal infarcts but usually in varying arterial territories and often accompanied by systemic or inflammatory signs. Thus, watershed ischemia best explains the imaging pattern.","fixed_at":"2025-05-24T18:35:30.486906","word_count":3989,"source_file":"PART I - 2024 - KSMC Revision_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","import_source":"vascular_neurology_stroke_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"4","question":"A patient presents with right-sided ptosis and deviation of the uvula.
