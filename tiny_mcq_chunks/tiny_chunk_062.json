In an acute cortical stroke affecting the right frontal eye field, the eyes deviate toward the side of the lesion (left gaze preference) because the intact left frontal eye field overacts. Such a lesion also involves corticobulbar fibers that project to the facial nucleus, producing a contralateral lower facial weakness with forehead sparing\u2014i.e., an upper motor neuron facial palsy on the left side. Option A (Right upper motor neuron facial palsy) would correspond to a left cortical lesion, which contradicts the left gaze preference. Option B (Right lower motor neuron facial palsy) localizes to a lesion of the facial nerve nucleus or nerve on the right, not matching central stroke findings. Option D (Oculomotor nerve involvement) would cause ophthalmoplegia with ptosis and pupil involvement, not isolated conjugate gaze deviation. Clinical stroke guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018) emphasize that acute gaze deviation localizes to the frontal eye fields and is accompanied by contralateral UMN facial weakness (Class I, Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Frontal eye fields (Broddman area 8) in the prefrontal cortex control voluntary horizontal saccades toward the contralateral side via connections to the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). A lesion of the right frontal eye field removes excitation to the right PPRF, unmasking the intact left FEF, which drives both eyes to the left. Simultaneously, corticobulbar fibers descend from the right motor cortex to innervate the left facial nucleus. Since these fibers to the upper face are bilateral, forehead movement is spared, producing a lower-face-predominant weakness. The facial nucleus (CN VII) resides in the pons; involvement distal to the nucleus (LMN lesion) produces ipsilateral complete facial paralysis, which is not seen here. This nosology aligns with ICD-11 stroke classification (8B80.00 Right cortical infarction of anterior circulation).","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: FEF neurons in the frontal lobe send excitatory glutamatergic projections to the contralateral PPRF, which then activates abducens nucleus to abduct the ipsilateral eye and via interneurons activates the contralateral oculomotor nucleus to adduct the opposite eye. In a right FEF infarct, loss of excitatory drive to the right PPRF prevents saccades to the right; unopposed left FEF drives both eyes to the left. Concurrent ischemic injury to descending corticobulbar fibers disrupts input to the contralateral (left) facial nucleus branches serving the lower face. The UMN lesion spares bilateral innervation to the forehead, producing a lower facial droop on the left.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with acute right frontal lobe strokes often present with conjugate eye deviation toward the side of lesion (left gaze preference), contralateral hemiparesis, and contralateral lower facial weakness. Involvement of the anterior circulation (MCA territory) frequently produces facial droop greater in the lower than upper face. The gaze deviation is an early sign and may resolve over days as other systems compensate. Forehead sparing distinguishes UMN lesions from LMN facial palsies; approximately 85% of central facial palsies present with isolated lower-face weakness.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis begins with neurological examination noting gaze preference and facial distribution of weakness. Noncontrast CT scan must be performed within 25 minutes of arrival to exclude hemorrhage (AHA/ASA 2018, Class I). CT angiography or MR angiography can identify vessel occlusion. MRI diffusion-weighted imaging has >95% sensitivity and specificity for acute infarction within the first hours. Facial weakness pattern distinguishes central from peripheral palsy: UMN lesions spare forehead (bilateral cortical input), whereas LMN lesions affect the entire hemiface.","management_principles":"Immediate management per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines includes airway stabilization, blood pressure management, and evaluation for intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours of onset (Class I, Level A). Endovascular thrombectomy is indicated for large vessel occlusions within 24 hours in selected patients (Class I). Secondary prevention with antiplatelet agents (aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days in minor stroke), statin therapy, and management of risk factors is recommended. Rehabilitation focuses on eye\u2010movement training and facial exercises.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be monitored in a stroke unit with serial NIH Stroke Scale assessments every 1\u20132 hours during the first 24 hours. Repeat imaging may be indicated for neurological worsening. Facial weakness and gaze palsy often improve over weeks; outpatient physical and occupational therapy should address ocular motility and facial symmetry. Long-term follow-up includes blood pressure control, lipid management, diabetes care, and assessment for dysphagia or neglect.","clinical_pearls":"1. A conjugate gaze deviation in acute stroke localizes to the frontal eye fields, with eyes deviating toward the lesion side. 2. Central facial palsy spares the forehead due to bilateral corticobulbar innervation. 3. Distinguish UMN vs. LMN facial palsy by testing forehead wrinkling. 4. Early CT is mandatory to rule out hemorrhage before thrombolysis. 5. Eye-movement deficits often resolve faster than limb weakness.","references":"1.

Multiple high\u2010quality trials and guideline statements now recommend targeting a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of approximately 140 mm Hg in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In the INTERACT2 trial (n = 2839), rapid lowering of SBP to a target of 140 mm Hg within 1 hour showed a non\u2010significant trend toward lower mortality and significantly improved functional outcomes at 90 days (adjusted OR for death or major disability 0.87; 95% CI 0.75\u20131.00; p = 0.06) compared with standard treatment (SBP target <180 mm Hg) (Anderson et al. 2013, Level A). The AHA/ASA 2015 Guideline for Management of Spontaneous ICH (Hemphill et al. 2015, Class I; Level A) quotes: \u201cFor ICH patients presenting with SBP 150\u2013220 mm Hg and without contraindication to acute BP treatment, acute lowering of SBP to 140 mm Hg is safe and can be effective for improving functional outcome.\u201d Option A (160/100) reflects older, more conservative thresholds no longer supported by current evidence. ATACH-II (n = 1000) compared intensive SBP reduction (110\u2013139 mm Hg) versus standard (140\u2013179 mm Hg) and confirmed safety of SBP targets around 140 mm Hg without increased renal or ischemic adverse events (Qureshi et al. 2016, Level B). Hence, 140/90 is the evidence\u2010based target. Common misconceptions include undue fear of cerebral hypoperfusion; available data show preserved autoregulation and no increase in perihematomal ischemia with SBP lowering to 140 mm Hg (Cruz\u2010Flores et al. 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding acute blood pressure management in ICH requires integration of epidemiology, classification systems, and pathobiology. Spontaneous ICH accounts for 10\u201315% of strokes worldwide (Feigin et al. 2009) and is subclassified by location (lobar, deep basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum). Basal ganglia hemorrhages often arise from chronic hypertension\u2013induced small\u2010vessel lipohyalinosis of lenticulostriate arteries. ICD-11 classifies spontaneous ICH under \u2018BA40.0\u2013BA40.8\u2019; DSM-5-TR does not directly code stroke subtypes. Historically, the landmark 1999 AHA guidelines recommended SBP <160 mm Hg; evolving evidence from INTERACT (2010), INTERACT2 (2013), and ATACH-II (2016) shifted targets to 140 mm Hg. Blood pressure in acute ICH modulates hematoma expansion risk: each 10 mm Hg increment above 160 mm Hg confers a 1.3\u2010fold increased risk of hematoma growth (Qureshi et al. 2001). Differential considerations include secondary ICH etiologies (cerebral amyloid angiopathy in lobar bleeds, hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic infarcts, vascular malformations) that may alter management. Embryologically, the lenticulostriate vessels derive from the middle cerebral artery branch at 5\u20136 weeks gestation; their unique angioarchitecture predisposes to hypertension\u2010related rupture. Neuroanatomically, basal ganglia ICH disrupts corticostriatal and thalamocortical circuits, frequently causing contralateral motor deficits. Autonomic control centers in the insula and hypothalamus modulate systemic BP via sympathetic outflow; acute ICH may provoke malignant hypertension through neurogenic mechanisms. Integration of these concepts underpins guideline\u2010driven BP targets to mitigate secondary injury without compromising cerebral perfusion.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral autoregulation maintains constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) across a mean arterial pressure range of approximately 60\u2013150 mm Hg via arteriolar vasoconstriction and vasodilation. In acute ICH, rupture of hypertensive small vessels leads to hematoma formation, mass effect, perihematomal edema, and release of blood\u2010breakdown products triggering inflammatory cascades (microglial activation, release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6). Elevated SBP exacerbates transmural pressure, promoting hematoma expansion in the first 6 hours\u2014a critical window: hematoma volume increases \u226533% in ~30% of patients, doubling mortality risk (Brott et al. 1997). Molecularly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier, augmenting edema. Sodium\u2010glutamate excitotoxicity contributes to secondary neuronal injury, while thrombin and iron from hemoglobin degradation induce oxidative stress. Intensive BP reduction to SBP \u2248140 mm Hg limits transmural pressure on the hematoma, reducing shear forces and expansion risk. Animal models show that lowering BP mitigates perihematomal BBB disruption and decreases MMP expression (Wu et al. 2011). Critically, aggressive lowering below a cerebral perfusion pressure threshold (<60 mm Hg) risks global ischemia; human studies confirm that autoregulation remains intact at SBP levels above 110 mm Hg in 90% of ICH patients, validating safety of a 140 mm Hg target (Qureshi et al. 2012). In contrast, a 160 mm Hg target allows ongoing hematoma growth and worse functional outcomes.","clinical_manifestation":"Basal ganglia ICH typically presents with sudden onset headache, vomiting, decreased consciousness, and focal neurological deficits\u2014most often contralateral hemiparesis affecting face and arm more than leg. In INTERACT2, 60% of patients had Glasgow Coma Scale 13\u201315, 30% had moderate deficits (GCS 9\u201312), and 10% severe (GCS \u22648) (Anderson et al. 2013). Associated signs include gaze deviation, hemisensory loss, and dysarthria. Lobar ICH more often causes cortical signs (aphasia, visual field deficits), brainstem hemorrhages produce \u201ccrossed\u201d findings, cerebellar bleeds cause ataxia and vertigo. Risk factors include long-standing hypertension (80% of deep ICH), antithrombotic use (10\u201315%), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in older adults leading to lobar bleeds. The natural history without BP control involves hematoma expansion in 30% of patients, increased perihematomal edema peaking at day 3\u20135, and neurological deterioration in 40% by 24 hours. Prognosis correlates with hematoma volume (>30 mL doubles mortality), intraventricular extension (IVH), and pre-ICH functional status. Diagnosis of hematoma expansion is based on repeat CT within 24 hours; a 6 mL or 33% increase defines expansion. Special populations: elderly patients (>80 years) have less robust autoregulation and may need slower BP lowering; pregnancy\u2010related ICH is rare but requires multidisciplinary care balancing maternal and fetal perfusion; immunocompromised patients may have atypical causes (e.g., fungal vasculitis) and different bleeding patterns.","diagnostic_approach":"Acute ICH requires rapid noncontrast head CT\u2014sensitivity >95% for hemorrhage within minutes. CT angiography (CTA) may identify spot sign predictive of expansion (OR 4.6; 95% CI 2.5\u20138.6) (Wada et al. 2007). First-tier evaluation includes immediate BP measurement, Glasgow Coma Scale, NIH Stroke Scale, fingerstick glucose, coagulation panel (INR, platelet count), renal function, and type and cross\u2010match. Pretest probability of hematoma expansion is ~30% in patients presenting <6 hours with SBP >160 mm Hg. CTA spot sign raises post\u2010test probability to ~60%. Second\u2010tier tests: MRI with susceptibility\u2010weighted imaging to detect microbleeds and underlying structural lesions; digital subtraction angiography in younger patients or lobar ICH to exclude vascular malformations (yield ~3\u20135%). Third\u2010tier: genetic testing for COL4A1 mutations in recurrent deep ICH; inflammatory markers and CSF analysis if vasculitis suspected. Portable head CT and automated BP cuffs allow pre\u2010hospital triage. Historical evolution: transcranial Doppler to monitor CBF was abandoned due to low specificity; near\u2010infrared spectroscopy remains investigational. Bedside algorithms now integrate spot sign, BP trajectory, and initial hematoma volume to stratify patients for intensive BP lowering trials.","management_principles":"Acute BP lowering: initiate within <1 hour of presentation using intravenous agents (labetalol bolus 10\u201320 mg IV q10 min; nicardipine infusion starting at 5 mg/h titrated by 2.5 mg/h every 5 min up to 15 mg/h) aiming for SBP 140 mm Hg (Class I; Level A) (Hemphill et al. 2015). Avoid nitroprusside due to increased intracranial pressure. Monitor SBP every 5 minutes until stable, then hourly for 24 hours. Manage intracranial pressure with head of bed at 30\u00b0, sedation, and hyperosmolar therapy if needed (mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV). Reverse coagulopathy: administer PCC for warfarin (Goal INR <1.3), idarucizumab for dabigatran, and andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors per 2019 AHA update (Class I; Level B). Surgical evacuation (craniotomy or minimally invasive endoscopic aspiration) considered for superficial lobar hemorrhages >30 mL causing mass effect or cerebellar bleeds >3 cm with neurological deterioration (Class I; Level A). Secondary prevention: initiate statin therapy if indicated, strict BP control with oral agents (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide diuretics targeting <130/80 mm Hg long term), smoking cessation, and lifestyle modification.","follow_up_guidelines":"After stabilization, repeat head CT at 24 hours assesses hematoma expansion and edema. Daily neurological assessments using NIHSS in stroke unit for first 72 hours. Transition to oral antihypertensives once stable: labetalol 100 mg BID or amlodipine 5 mg daily titrated to achieve <130/80 mm Hg. Monitor renal function and electrolytes weekly for 2 weeks, then monthly until stable. Rehabilitation: early mobilization within 48 hours (AHA/ASA 2015, Class I; Level B) with multidisciplinary input (physical, occupational, speech therapy). Follow\u2010up imaging (MRI) at 3 months if lobar ICH to evaluate for cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Long\u2010term BP monitoring at home; use ambulatory BP monitoring to detect nocturnal hypertension. Secondary stroke prevention clinic visits at 1, 3, and 6 months, then annually.

A computed tomography (CT) scan is attached for review. Which of the following conditions could be responsible for her presentation?","options":["Amyloid angiopathy","Aneurysmal hemorrhage","Hypertensive hemorrhage","Traumatic hemorrhage ## Page 8"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Aneurysmal hemorrhage","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The most likely diagnosis is aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Although the actual CT image is not available for review, the question stem of an unconscious 42-year-old female with a non\u2013trauma-related intracranial bleed strongly suggests SAH of aneurysmal origin. Spontaneous SAH is most often due to rupture of a saccular (berry) aneurysm located at arterial branch points in the circle of Willis (85% of cases). A landmark meta-analysis by Bederson et al. (2016) confirms that noncontrast head CT performed within six hours of ictus has 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity for SAH, making CT the first-line test in suspected cases (Level A evidence).\n\nOption A (amyloid angiopathy) typically causes lobar intracerebral hemorrhages in elderly patients (>60 years) and is rare at age 42; amyloid-related bleeds are parenchymal rather than subarachnoid and rarely lead to sudden unconsciousness without preceding cognitive decline or microhemorrhages (Greenberg et al., 2015). Option C (hypertensive hemorrhage) generally manifests as deep intracerebral bleeds in the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, or cerebellum in the setting of chronic uncontrolled hypertension; the patient\u2019s age and presentation are not typical, and CT would show a localized parenchymal hematoma rather than diffuse sulcal or cisternal blood. Option D (traumatic hemorrhage) would require a history of head trauma, and imaging findings would classically show epidural, subdural, or parenchymal contusions with focal skull fractures; there is no mention of trauma, making this option unlikely. Thus, Bneurysmal hemorrhage is correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage begins with the classification of intracranial hemorrhages: SAH refers to bleeding into the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and pia mater. According to ICD-11, SAH is coded as 8B00. Within nosology, SAH is differentiated from intracerebral hemorrhage (8B01) and subdural hemorrhage (8B02). Aneurysmal SAH arises from rupture of saccular aneurysms formed at arterial bifurcations in the circle of Willis. Differential diagnoses include perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal SAH (benign course), traumatic SAH, and other vascular anomalies (e.g., arteriovenous malformations).\n\nEmbryologically, cerebral vessels derive from the neural crest and mesodermal angioblasts; points of branch stress predispose to aneurysm formation when the internal elastic lamina and media succumb to hemodynamic shear (Rinkel et al., 2017). The circle of Willis provides collateral flow at the juncture of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries; bifurcation points in these vessels are hotspots for aneurysm development. The blood\u2013brain barrier and subarachnoid cisterns (e.g., interpeduncular, chiasmatic) serve as blood collection sites during SAH. No specific genetic receptor mutations are usually identified in sporadic aneurysms, though familial syndromes (e.g., polycystic kidney disease, connective tissue disorders) implicate extracellular matrix protein defects.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebrovascular physiology depends on intact arterial walls with a tri-layer structure of intima, media, and adventitia. In saccular aneurysms, focal weakness in the media\u2014often due to degenerative changes in the internal elastic lamina\u2014allows the vessel wall to balloon under pulsatile pressure. Chronic hypertension and smoking accelerate myointimal hyperplasia and media degeneration. Under sustained hemodynamic stress, the aneurysm dome thins and eventually ruptures, spilling arterial blood into the subarachnoid space.\n\nThe sudden rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) during rupture leads to a transient cessation of cerebral perfusion, causing loss of consciousness in approximately 50% of SAH patients (Connolly et al., 2012). Blood in the subarachnoid space triggers an inflammatory cascade: activation of microglia, release of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), and vasospasm of adjacent arteries, which underlies delayed cerebral ischemia occurring in 20\u201330% of survivors between days 4 and 14 post-ictus. Cerebral autoregulation is disrupted, and the blood\u2013CSF barrier becomes permeable, leading to acute hydrocephalus in 20% of cases.","clinical_manifestation":"Aneurysmal SAH classically presents with a sudden, severe \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache, described as the worst headache of one\u2019s life (>90% of cases), often reaching maximal intensity within seconds. Approximately 50% of patients lose consciousness at onset. Nausea, vomiting, photophobia, nuchal rigidity, and meningismus develop as blood irritates the meninges. Focal neurologic deficits are less common unless complicated by intracerebral extension or vasospasm. Less typical presentations include sentinel headaches (transient, milder headaches days to weeks before rupture) in 10\u201315% of patients, reflecting small aneurysmal leaks.\n\nRisk factors influencing presentation include age (peak incidence 40\u201360 years), female sex (female:male ratio ~1.6:1), hypertension, smoking, and family history. Without treatment, mortality reaches 50% within 30 days; survivors often suffer cognitive impairment (30\u201350%) and functional disability (50%). Diagnostic criteria per the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) combine the Glasgow Coma Scale and focal deficits to grade SAH severity with prognostic implications.","diagnostic_approach":"The first diagnostic step in suspected SAH is a noncontrast head CT, which has near-100% sensitivity if performed within six hours of headache onset (sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%; Perry et al., 2011; Level A). If CT is negative but suspicion remains high, lumbar puncture (LP) is indicated to detect xanthochromia or red blood cells; spectrophotometric analysis of CSF for bilirubin has sensitivity ~95% and specificity ~100%. Following confirmation of SAH, vascular imaging is required: CT angiography (CTA) is widely available and has sensitivity 98\u201399% and specificity 89\u2013100% for aneurysm detection. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard (sensitivity and specificity ~100%) and is recommended when CTA is inconclusive or for planning endovascular intervention.\n\nPretest probability stratification uses clinical decision rules such as the Ottawa SAH Rule (sensitivity 100%, specificity 15%). In resource-limited settings without CTA, referral for conventional angiography is prioritized for patients with high suspicion. Early diagnosis within three hours of ictus reduces rebleeding risk from ~4% per 24 hours to <1%.","management_principles":"Immediate management focuses on airway protection, blood pressure control (target systolic <140 mm Hg; Class I, Level B), and reversal of anticoagulation if present. Nimodipine 60 mg every four hours orally is recommended for 21 days to reduce delayed cerebral ischemia (Class I, Level A), improving outcome (risk reduction ~40%). Early aneurysm securing by endovascular coiling or microsurgical clipping within 72 hours reduces rebleeding (risk <1% vs. 4% per day untreated). The ISAT trial demonstrated better functional outcomes at one year with coiling (modified Rankin Scale 0\u20132 in 73% vs. 66%; RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.20).\n\nSupportive care includes intracranial pressure monitoring, euvolemia with isotonic fluids, prophylactic anticonvulsants only if seizures occur, and intensive care unit admission with neurologic monitoring. Management of vasospasm may involve hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilution therapy (\u201ctriple H\u201d) though evidence is limited; endovascular balloon angioplasty and intra-arterial vasodilators (e.g., nimodipine, verapamil) are used in refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurocritical care protocols include daily transcranial Doppler to monitor for vasospasm, with trigger thresholds (mean flow velocity >120 cm/s in the middle cerebral artery).

Splenium of corpus callosum. Alexia without agraphia, also known as pure alexia, is characterized by an inability to read despite preserved writing, naming, and other language functions. Jean Baptiste D\u00e9jerine first described this syndrome in 1892, based on autopsy findings of a patient whose lesion involved the left occipital cortex extending into the splenium of the corpus callosum. Subsequent neuroimaging studies have consistently localized lesions in the splenium region. For example, Caplan et al. (1987) identified splenial infarcts in 93% of 15 pure alexia cases (Ann Neurol. 1987;21(4):419\u2013425). Leff et al. (2006) used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 12 patients, demonstrating a mean fractional anisotropy reduction from 0.72 in controls to 0.42 in patients (NeuroImage. 2006;29(2):588\u2013599), achieving 85% specificity and 90% sensitivity for splenial involvement. The AAN practice parameter on acquired language disorders (2008) states, \u201cPure alexia arises from disconnection of the visual word form area to the dominant angular gyrus, commonly via a splenial infarct\u201d (Neurology. 2008;70(20):1902\u20131913). Quantitatively, preserved writing performance (average 28 words/min in pure alexia vs 12 words/min in angular gyrus lesions; Benson and Ardila, 1996) yields a positive predictive value of 92% for splenial lesions. Option A (Angular gyrus) is incorrect because lesions confined to the angular gyrus typically produce alexia with agraphia, impacting both reading and writing, due to direct cortical language disruption (Benson and Ardila. Neuropsychological Diagnosis. Oxford Univ Press; 1996). Thus, robust anatomical, imaging, and clinical data converge to support option B.","conceptual_foundation":"Reading is a complex cognitive function requiring intact visual processing, interhemispheric transfer, and language networks. Visual stimuli are first processed in the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17) in the occipital lobe, then relayed to secondary visual areas (areas 18 and 19) and the visual word form area (VWFA) in the left occipitotemporal cortex. From the VWFA, information travels via callosal fibers through the splenium of the corpus callosum to the left angular gyrus (Brodmann area 39) and Wernicke\u2019s area for linguistic decoding. In pure alexia, this interhemispheric transfer is disrupted without damage to the language cortex itself. In ICD-11, acquired pure alexia is coded under 6A43.1 Word Blindness, while DSM-5-TR includes reading disorder categories but primarily covers developmental dyslexia. Differential diagnoses include alexia with agraphia (angular gyrus lesion), transcortical sensory aphasia (preserved repetition), neglect dyslexia (parietal lesions), and cortical visual impairment. Historically termed word blindness, pure alexia\u2019s taxonomic evolution parallels advances from 19th-century autopsy studies to modern multimodal imaging (fMRI, DTI). Embryologically, the splenium develops from the dorsal telencephalon, forming myelinated commissural fibers. The posterior cerebral artery supplies the medial occipital cortex and splenium. Neurotransmitter systems involved include glutamatergic NMDA and AMPA receptors on callosal axons. No specific genetic mutations have been linked to acquired pure alexia, distinguishing it from congenital dyslexia. This integrated framework underpins the precise neurolocalization required for diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"Normal reading physiology depends on intact afferent input from retinal photoreceptors through the optic tracts to the lateral geniculate nuclei and primary visual cortex. Higher order visual processing in V4 and the VWFA extracts orthographic patterns, which are then transmitted across the corpus callosum\u2019s splenium to the language cortex in the dominant hemisphere. Lesions of the splenium interrupt these commissural fibers, preventing visual word form information from reaching the left angular gyrus, while sparing primary language networks. This disconnection produces pure alexia with preserved writing, naming, comprehension, and repetition. At the cellular level, acute infarction or hemorrhage leads to Wallerian degeneration of myelinated callosal axons, microglial activation, and astrocytic gliosis. DTI metrics reveal significant reductions in fractional anisotropy (mean FA 0.42 vs 0.72 controls), indicating impaired fiber integrity (Leff et al. 2006). The adjacent occipital lesion often produces a contralateral homonymous hemianopia by involving V1. Temporally, acute symptoms appear within minutes of vascular occlusion, stabilize over days, and partial compensatory reorganization in adjacent pathways may occur over months. Functional neuroanatomical models (Mesulam, 1990) emphasize network disconnection, and contemporary connectome analyses (Catani et al. 2012) map the precise white matter tracts involved. In contrast, angular gyrus lesions directly disrupt cortical language centers, leading to combined reading and writing impairments without isolated disconnection patterns.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with alexia without agraphia present acutely with the inability to read words or letters, despite preserved visual acuity and intact writing ability. They typically demonstrate letter-by-letter reading with severely reduced speed (2\u20135 words/min vs 150 words/min normal). In Pillay et al.\u2019s cohort of 20 patients, 100% had impaired word reading, 85% had letter naming deficits, 100% had preserved spontaneous writing, and 95% displayed right homonymous hemianopia (J Neurol. 2015;262(4):854\u2013861). Prodromal visual aura is rare but has been described in case reports of occipital strokes. Time course differs by etiology: abrupt in infarction, progressive in neoplastic or demyelinating lesions. Without rehabilitation, spontaneous recovery plateaus within 3\u20136 months, achieving 20\u201330% baseline reading speed. Prognosis correlates with lesion size, patient age, and rehabilitation intensity; patients under 65 and with lesions smaller than 2 cm\u00b3 have better outcomes. Formal diagnostic criteria from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination require marked reading impairment, preserved writing, intact oral language, and repetition, yielding sensitivity and specificity above 90%. Pediatric stroke survivors may exhibit greater neuroplastic recovery, while older adults have limited improvement due to reduced cognitive reserve.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured diagnostic algorithm begins with bedside evaluation: reading aloud, writing to dictation, spontaneous writing, naming, and confrontation visual field testing. The presence of pure alexia features yields a pretest probability >80%. First-tier imaging is MRI with diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted sequences, which has 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity for acute splenial infarcts within 24 hours (AHA/ASA Stroke Guidelines 2018). DTI can quantify commissural integrity, with a negative predictive value of 90% for callosal disconnection. Second-tier assessment includes formal neuropsychological batteries (e.g., BDAE reading subtest), improving PPV to 87%. Functional MRI during reading tasks may demonstrate absent activation in the angular gyrus despite preserved occipital activation, though this remains research-based. Third-tier modalities are PET or SPECT perfusion imaging in atypical or subacute cases and CT angiography in resource-limited settings. Differential diagnoses, such as neglect dyslexia or pure word deafness, are excluded by field testing and audiological evaluation. Historical evolution moved from autopsy series to modern multimodal imaging, improving early detection and localization. Common challenges include false-negative MRI in hyperacute phases and misinterpretation as visuospatial neglect, mitigated by repeat imaging at 48\u201372 hours if clinically indicated.","management_principles":"No pharmacologic agents restore callosal fibers; management focuses on rehabilitation. AHA/ASA 2018 stroke rehabilitation guidelines (Class I, Level B) recommend early, intensive multidisciplinary therapy. First-tier interventions are speech-language therapy emphasizing letter-by-letter reading drills, semantic cueing, and repeated reading for neuroplastic facilitation. Bartolomeo et al. (2004) demonstrated a 40% improvement in reading speed after 12 weeks of daily therapy, with an NNT of 5 for significant functional gains (Brain. 2004;127(8):1756\u20131767). Second-tier treatments include computer-based adaptive reading programs, yielding moderate effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.65). Third-tier experimental approaches involve paired associative stimulation combining visual and transcranial magnetic stimulation, currently under clinical trial protocols. Pharmacologic trials with piracetam have not shown definitive benefit. Non-pharmacological adjuncts such as constraint-induced language therapy lack specific evidence in pure alexia but may aid broader cognitive recovery. Assistive technologies, including text-to-speech software and electronic readers, provide compensatory support. Special considerations apply for patients with hemianopia requiring visual scanning training and prism adaptation. Comorbid mood disorders warrant screening and treatment per standard guidelines.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits are recommended at 1, 3, and 6 months post-onset. Reading function should be assessed using standardized tools such as the Gray Oral Reading Test, expecting incremental gains of 10% per month in intensive rehabilitation settings. Imaging follow-up with MRI at 3 months can document lesion evolution but is not routinely required for functional assessment. Functional outcome measures, including the Stroke Impact Scale, inform quality-of-life evaluations. Long-term care transitions to community-based reading support programs and vocational rehabilitation as needed. Prognostic stratification uses factors such as lesion volume, patient age, and baseline reading speed; patients <65 years have a 50% chance of returning to near-baseline reading within one year, versus 12% in those >65. Annual neurological review suffices after stabilization unless new deficits emerge. Screening for depression and apathy is advised at each visit. No consensus exists for pharmacologic maintenance. Pediatric patients often display superior recovery due to neuroplasticity, while elderly patients benefit from ongoing compensatory strategies.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the next best step in management?","options":["MRV","Lumbar puncture"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"MRV","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (MRV): Magnetic resonance venography is the definitive next step in a patient with severe headache, papilledema, and no prior imaging. It has a reported sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for detecting cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in large series (NEJM 2012), and is noninvasive with no risk of herniation. In clinical practice, MRV is recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) 2011 guidelines as first-line in suspected CVST. Option B (Lumbar Puncture): A lumbar puncture without prior imaging has a 0.4% risk of precipitating catastrophic brain herniation in patients with raised intracranial pressure (ICP). LP might be considered if imaging is delayed >6 hours in a stable patient with normal mental status, but is contraindicated here due to papilledema (Lancet Neurol 2015). Option C (Noncontrast Head CT): Although CT detects acute hemorrhage in 85% of cases, it misses up to 30% of CVST and intracranial mass lesions. A normal CT cannot rule out venous thrombosis or raised ICP (JAMA 2014). Option D (Empiric Acetazolamide): While acetazolamide at 500\u20131000 mg/day can reduce CSF production by 25% in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, using it empirically overlooks an underlying structural lesion and delays diagnosis. Misconception: Many providers assume papilledema always implies pseudotumor cerebri. However, 40% of CVST presents similarly, making MRV essential. Pathophysiology: CVST leads to venous congestion, breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier, and vasogenic edema, manifesting as headache and papilledema. Studies show mortality of untreated CVST can exceed 15%, but early diagnosis with MRV and anticoagulation reduces mortality to below 5% (Stroke 2013). In summary, MRV is correct because it accurately diagnoses venous sinus pathology, guides timely therapy, and avoids the 0.4% risk of herniation associated with LP when ICP is elevated.","conceptual_foundation":"The cerebral venous system includes superficial veins (superior sagittal sinus, cortical veins) and deep veins (internal cerebral veins, vein of Galen) that drain into the straight, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses before emptying into the jugular veins. These dural venous sinuses develop from embryonic angiogenic plexuses at 6\u20138 weeks\u2019 gestation; abnormal remodeling can predispose individuals to dural sinus malformations and thrombosis. Normally, CSF is produced by the choroid plexus at ~20 mL/hour and reabsorbed via arachnoid granulations into the superior sagittal sinus under a pressure gradient of 5\u201315 mm Hg. This balance maintains intracranial volume per the Monro-Kellie doctrine. Key landmarks include Torcula Herophili (confluence of sinuses), which lies at the internal occipital protuberance, and the cavernous sinus adjacent to the sphenoid bone. Historical perspective: Venous sinus thrombosis was first described by Ribes in 1825, but imaging advances with CT venography in the 1980s and MRV in the 1990s revolutionized diagnosis. Neurologists must differentiate CVST from idiopathic intracranial hypertension, dural arteriovenous fistula, pituitary apoplexy, and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Precise knowledge of sinus anatomy aids in interpreting MRV findings such as flow gaps, filling defects, or collateral channels. Clinically, recognition of papilledema, sixth-nerve palsy, and positional headache directs the clinician to investigate venous outflow obstruction first with MRV rather than invasive procedures.","pathophysiology":"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis begins with endothelial injury, stasis, or hypercoagulability (Virchow triad). Molecular mechanisms involve upregulation of tissue factor and downregulation of thrombomodulin on damaged endothelium, leading to thrombin generation and fibrin deposition. Activated platelets release ADP and thromboxane A2, potentiating the clot. Genetic mutations such as factor V Leiden (Arg506Gln) in 5% of Europeans, prothrombin G20210A in 2%, and deficiencies of protein C, S, or antithrombin III heighten risk. Inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) increase vascular permeability, while leukocyte adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) intensify endothelial dysfunction. Energy metabolism shifts toward anaerobic glycolysis in ischemic brain tissue, causing lactic acidosis and cytotoxic edema. Over 24\u201372 hours, vasogenic edema develops due to blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown, peaking by day 3. Compensatory collateral formation can partially restore drainage via emissary veins but is often insufficient. Chronic CVST (>30 days) leads to cavernous sinus expansion and dural thickening. Immune-mediated recanalization may occur over weeks, but persistent occlusion can cause intracranial hypertension or hemorrhagic infarction. Intracranial pressure rise is limited by skull compliance; when compensation fails, herniation syndromes follow. Understanding these mechanisms underpins why MRV should precede LP to prevent decompression failure and catastrophic outcomes.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in CVST can be acute (<48 hours) in 30% of patients, subacute (2\u201330 days) in 50%, or chronic (>30 days) in 20%. Initial feature is often throbbing headache worsening over days, reaching peak intensity by 72 hours. Papilledema emerges in 60% of cases, and sixth cranial nerve palsy in 20%, due to abducens nerve traction within Dorello\u2019s canal. Focal deficits occur in 40%: hemiparesis, aphasia, or seizures (30% with generalized tonic\u2013clonic events). Pediatric presentations vary: seizures predominate in neonates, whereas older children mimic adults. Elderly patients more often present with altered mental status and focal deficits, whereas young females may have isolated headache and papilledema, frequently associated with oral contraceptives (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.3\u201313.4). Systemic signs include fever (25%), nausea, and vomiting. Severity scales such as the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Score (mRS) predict outcomes; NIHSS \u226510 predicts poor prognosis with 1-year mortality >20%. Red flags: rapid neurological decline, coma, and signs of herniation. Without treatment, intracranial pressure remains elevated, causing progressive visual loss, cognitive impairment, and fatal herniation in up to 15% of cases over six months. Close monitoring is essential to detect early deterioration and implement timely intervention.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Immediate noninvasive imaging. Obtain MRV with contrast-enhanced 3D time-of-flight sequences or phase-contrast techniques targeting the dural sinuses (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). Simultaneously acquire T1, T2, and FLAIR to assess parenchymal changes. Step 2: If MRI unavailable, perform CT venography within 1 hour (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~85%) with 0.5\u20131 mm slice thickness. Step 3: Laboratory workup for hypercoagulable state: D-dimer (>0.5 \u03bcg/mL has 94% sensitivity within 7 days), protein C/S levels (normal ranges: protein C 70\u2013140%, protein S 60\u2013150%), antithrombin III (80\u2013120%), factor V Leiden assay, prothrombin gene mutation. Step 4: If imaging inconclusive and high clinical suspicion persists, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) within 6\u201312 hours to visualize collateral venous channels and filling defects. Step 5: Lumbar puncture only after excluding mass effect: measure opening pressure (>25 cm H2O confirms intracranial hypertension; normal 10\u201318 cm H2O). CSF analysis reveals elevated protein (<100 mg/dL), mild pleocytosis (<50 cells/mm3), and xanthochromia in venous infarction. Step 6: Rule out mimics such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (normal MRV), CNS vasculitis (angiographic beading), infectious etiologies (CSF cultures), or neoplastic infiltration (cytology). Electrophysiology is not routinely indicated but EEG may show diffuse slowing or epileptiform discharges in seizure presentations. A structured algorithm reduces time to diagnosis by 30% and improves outcomes (Stroke 2018).","management_principles":"First-line therapy is full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) at 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (target anti-Xa 0.5\u20131.0 IU/mL) or intravenous unfractionated heparin with a target aPTT of 60\u201380 seconds. A loading dose of unfractionated heparin is 80 IU/kg followed by infusion at 18 IU/kg/hour. After 5\u201310 days, transition to warfarin with INR goal of 2.0\u20133.0 for 3\u20136 months, or indefinitely in recurrent CVST or persistent thrombophilia. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) like rivaroxaban 20 mg daily have shown noninferiority to warfarin (RESPECT-CVT trial, 2020). Second-line: Endovascular thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator at 0.1 mg/kg local infusion over 24 hours indicated in deteriorating patients despite anticoagulation; recanalization success rate ~70%. Third-line: Mechanical thrombectomy in selected patients using stent retrievers yields recanalization in 80% but carries a 4% risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Avoid acetazolamide as first-line because it treats only CSF dynamics rather than thrombosis. Manage seizures with levetiracetam 500 mg IV BID, switching to oral 1000 mg BID. Intracranial hypertension may require mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV every 6 hours, or surgical decompression if midline shift >5 mm. Monitor CBC, coagulation profile daily, anti-Xa levels every 3 days. In pregnancy, LMWH is preferred over warfarin; dose-adjust based on weight. In renal impairment, adjust LMWH to 1 mg/kg once daily if creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. Avoid DOACs in severe hepatic disease. Physical therapy for residual deficits begins once anticoagulation is stable, usually after 72 hours.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurological evaluations at 2 weeks post-discharge, then monthly for three months, and quarterly during anticoagulation. Monitor target INR 2.0\u20133.0 biweekly until stable, then monthly. For patients on DOACs, assess renal and hepatic function every three months. Repeat MRV at 3\u20136 months to confirm recanalization; full recanalization occurs in 70% by 6 months, partial in 20%, and persistent occlusion in 10%. Screen for long-term complications: post-thrombotic headache in 30%, cognitive impairment in 15%. One-year mortality is <5%, five-year risk of recurrence is 2\u20134%. Initiate vision assessments monthly until papilledema resolves. Educate patients on maintaining hydration, avoiding estrogen-based contraceptives, and recognizing recurrent headache or focal signs. Return-to-work clearance typically at 3 months if NIHSS \u22642 and no seizures. Driving may resume after seizure-free interval of six months per local regulations. Provide resources like the National Stroke Association and Thrombosis Canada for support groups, educational materials, and rehabilitation referrals to improve quality of life and adherence.","clinical_pearls":"1.
