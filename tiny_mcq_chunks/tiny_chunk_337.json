What else is associated?","options":["Cancer","Diabetes mellitus","Myotonic dystrophy","Normal androgen levels"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Diabetes mellitus","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: Diabetes mellitus. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is a multisystem disorder characterized by myotonia, distal muscle weakness, facial weakness with atrophy, ptosis, early-onset cataracts, and endocrine abnormalities including insulin resistance and overt diabetes mellitus. Multiple studies (Harper 2001; Mathieu et al. 2001) report that up to 25\u200a\u2013\u200a30% of adult DM1 patients develop glucose intolerance or overt diabetes due to pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Option A (Cancer) is incorrect: although there is a slightly increased risk of benign tumors (pilomatricomas), there is no strong epidemiologic link between DM1 and malignancy. Option C (Myotonic dystrophy) merely restates the diagnosis rather than an associated feature. Option D (Normal androgen levels) is incorrect: DM1 patients often have endocrine gonadal dysfunction, with testicular atrophy and reduced testosterone levels (Laurent et al. 2003).","conceptual_foundation":"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (Steinert disease) is a CTG triplet-repeat expansion disorder on chromosome 19q13.3. It belongs to the family of trinucleotide-repeat expansion diseases (which include Huntington\u2019s and fragile X syndrome). The abnormal expansion (\u226550 repeats) leads to toxic RNA transcripts that sequester splicing factors (MBNL1), causing mis-splicing of multiple transcripts including insulin receptor pre-mRNA. This mis-splicing underlies insulin resistance. DM1 is classified in ICD-11 under neuromuscular diseases (8E71.0). Differential diagnoses include myotonia congenita, other muscular dystrophies (eg, facioscapulohumeral), and channelopathies. Embryologically, skeletal muscle develops from somitic mesoderm; DM1 pathology affects type I and type II fibers via widespread RNA toxicity. Neuroanatomically, the disease primarily involves peripheral muscle fibers, with secondary neuromuscular junction changes.","pathophysiology":"Normal insulin receptor (IR) pre-mRNA is spliced to yield the IR-B isoform in muscle, which has high insulin affinity. In DM1, sequestration of MBNL1 and upregulation of CUG-BP1 lead to preferential expression of the fetal IR-A isoform, reducing insulin sensitivity (Savkur et al. 2001). On a cellular level, CTG RNAs fold into hairpins trapping splicing regulators, altering splicing of multiple targets (Clcn1 chloride channel \u2192 myotonia; TNNT2 troponin \u2192 cardiomyopathy; INSR \u2192 insulin resistance). The multi-organ phenotype arises from RNA toxicity rather than structural protein deficiency. Endocrine manifestations like diabetes result from both peripheral insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction, with hyperglycemia exacerbating proteostasis stress in muscle.","clinical_manifestation":"DM1 typically presents in adults with myotonia (delayed relaxation), distal muscle weakness (finger flexors), facial weakness (\u2019hatchet facies\u2019) and ptosis without ophthalmoplegia. Approximately 20\u200a\u2013\u200a30% develop glucose intolerance or overt diabetes (Mathieu et al. 2001). Other features: early frontal balding, cataracts by age 40 in >90%, cardiac conduction defects (up to 70%), gastrointestinal dysmotility, and testicular atrophy. Congenital and juvenile forms exist with more severe systemic involvement. Untreated DM1 shows gradual progression of weakness at ~1\u20133% loss of strength per year; diabetes accelerates muscle wasting. EMG shows myotonic discharges (>20\u200a\u2013\u200a40 Hz).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis rests on genetic testing: PCR and Southern blot quantify CTG repeat size. First-tier: EMG for myotonic discharges (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). Second-tier: molecular testing confirming CTG expansion (>50 repeats). Endocrine evaluation includes fasting glucose and HbA1c (ADA criteria: HbA1c \u22656.5% diagnostic). Echocardiography/ECG screen conduction disease. Pre-test probability is high when clinical triad present; genetic confirmation has near-100% specificity. Muscle biopsy is rarely needed but shows fiber size variation, atrophy of type I fibers, and central nuclei.","management_principles":"No disease-modifying therapy exists for DM1. Management is multidisciplinary. Myotonia: treat with mexiletine (200\u200a\u2013\u200a400 mg/day; class I recommendation, Level B) which reduces myotonic discharges and improves hand opening times. Diabetes: manage per ADA guidelines with metformin first-line, then add sulfonylureas or insulin based on glycemic control. Cardiac: pacemaker for conduction block (class I, Level C). Cataracts: phacoemulsification when visually significant. Physical therapy slows contractures; occupational therapy addresses daily activities. Genetic counseling is essential. Ongoing trials target RNA toxicity with antisense oligonucleotides (Phase II data pending).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 6\u201312 months with neurology, annual ECG and Holter for conduction disease, annual ophthalmology for cataracts, and annual endocrine evaluation for glycemic control. Monitor pulmonary function (spirometry) annually; refer for noninvasive ventilation if FVC <50%. Testicular ultrasound and endocrine labs (FSH, LH, testosterone) annually in men. Provide patient education on symptom monitoring, falls prevention, and glucose self-monitoring. Adjust therapies based on progression and complications.","clinical_pearls":"1. Myotonia in DM1 often starts in finger flexors\u2014test by asking patient to open hand after handshake. 2. Facial weakness with ptosis but preserved extraocular movements is characteristic. 3. Early-onset cataracts (<40 years) in a muscular dystrophy points to DM1. 4. Endocrine screening is crucial; up to 30% have insulin resistance or diabetes. 5. Genetic anticipation: maternal transmission often leads to congenital DM1 with severe hypotonia and respiratory failure.","references":"1. Harper PS. Myotonic Dystrophy. 3rd ed. Saunders; 2001. 2.

What gene is associated with this condition?","options":["PMP-22","MPZ","GJB1","MFN2"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"PMP-22","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Correct): The PMP-22 gene encodes peripheral myelin protein 22 critical for compact myelin formation in peripheral nerves. Duplication of this 1.4\u20131.5 Mb region on chromosome 17p11.2 occurs in approximately 70\u201380% of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type 1A (HMSN1A) cases and leads to characteristic demyelination with onion bulb formations and markedly slowed conduction velocities (20\u201330 m/s). Clinical studies report 85% penetrance by age 30 and a uniform phenotype of distal weakness, foot deformities, and areflexia. Pathophysiologically, PMP-22 overexpression disrupts Schwann cell homeostasis, triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, and drives cycles of demyelination\u2013remyelination manifesting as onion bulbs. These molecular and histological data definitively support PMP-22 duplication as the causative lesion.\n\nOption B (MPZ): Myelin protein zero (MPZ) gene mutations on chromosome 1q23.2 cause CMT1B, accounting for 5\u201310% of demyelinating CMT. Onset is often later (second\u2013third decade), and conduction velocities vary widely (12\u201340 m/s). While modest onion bulb proliferation may exist, MPZ defects present distinctive clinical scenarios such as vocal cord paralysis and late-onset neuropathy, making it less likely in classic early\u2010onset onion bulb HMSN.\n\nOption C (GJB1): Connexin32 encoded by GJB1 on Xq13.1 produces X-linked CMT (CMTX1). Affected males show intermediate conduction velocities (25\u201345 m/s) with transient CNS white matter lesions in 10\u201315% on MRI. Histology is dominated by reduced myelin compaction rather than classic onion bulbs, so GJB1 is unlikely here.\n\nOption D (MFN2): Mitofusin 2 mutations on chromosome 1p36 cause CMT2A, an axonal neuropathy. Conduction velocities typically exceed 38 m/s, reflecting preserved myelin, and onion bulbs are absent as pathology centers on axonal degeneration rather than Schwann cell proliferation. Thus, MFN2 is excluded in demyelinating onion bulb neuropathies.\n\nCommon misconceptions include attributing any slowed conduction to diverse CMT genes. However, allele dosage effects, histopathology, and conduction metrics specifically implicate PMP-22 duplication in classic onion bulb HMSN1A. Studies (Lupski et al., 1991; Wrabetz et al., 2000) confirm PMP-22\u2019s unique pathologic signature in CMT1A.","conceptual_foundation":"Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), also termed hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type 1A (HMSN1A), primarily involves Schwann cells of peripheral nerves. Each peripheral nerve comprises multiple fascicles, with individual axons ensheathed by Schwann cells forming multilamellar compact myelin. Myelin maintains saltatory conduction by insulating internodes and concentrating voltage-gated sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier. The sheath\u2019s architecture includes key proteins: peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22), myelin protein zero (P0), and peripheral myelin basic protein, all contributing to lamellar stability and internodal spacing of 1\u20131.5 mm. Onion bulb formations result from repeated demyelination\u2013remyelination cycles, leading to concentric Schwann cell proliferation around axons and endoneurial collagen deposition. Embryologically, Schwann cells derive from neural crest cells migrating along peripheral axons by week 8 of gestation and maturing by week 12. Related neuropathies include CMT1B (MPZ mutations), CMTX1 (GJB1), and CMT2A (MFN2). Historically, Charcot and Marie first described distal muscular atrophy and sensory loss in 1886, later unified under the HMSN term in 1950. Key clinical landmarks such as pes cavus and hammertoes reflect chronic denervation, whereas electrophysiological markers\u2014nodal sodium channel clustering and internodal length\u2014guide subtype differentiation. Understanding normal myelin physiology and its disruption underpins targeted diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.","pathophysiology":"In CMT1A, PMP-22 overexpression from gene duplication disrupts Schwann cell lipid rafts and protein\u2013protein interactions essential for compact myelin. Excess PMP-22 accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating the unfolded protein response through PERK-eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Sustained ER stress induces CHOP-mediated apoptosis of Schwann cells, promoting focal demyelination. Myelin breakdown mobilizes macrophages that release matrix metalloproteinases, further degrading basal lamina. Denuded axons attempt remyelination via Schwann cell proliferation, generating onion bulb structures. Internodal architecture is altered, and rearranged sodium channel clusters at paranodes impair saltatory conduction, reducing velocities to 20\u201330 m/s. Genetically, CMT1A is autosomal dominant with 50% transmission risk. Duplication size variability (1.4\u20131.6 Mb) contributes to 10\u201320% phenotypic expressivity differences. Accelerated energy expenditure\u2014up to 25% higher during repair\u2014increases mitochondrial demand, risking axonal atrophy when ATP synthesis is insufficient. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) amplify Schwann cell damage. Over time, chronic cycles of demyelination and remyelination lead to endoneurial fibrosis and axonal loss, manifesting as progressive distal weakness and sensory impairment that typically stabilizes by the fourth decade once maximal fibrosis is reached.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in CMT1A usually occurs between ages 5 and 20, peaking at age 15. Early signs include tripping, ankle instability, and foot paresthesias. Examination reveals distal muscle weakness with ankle dorsiflexion strength reduced to 2\u20133/5 in 80% of patients by age 20, absent or diminished Achilles reflexes in 95%, and decreased vibration sense at the ankles in 90%. Pes cavus and hammertoes develop in 60% by early adulthood. Upper limb involvement arises later, with thenar and interossei atrophy in 40%. Pediatric patients may show delayed motor milestones and frequent falls. Adults demonstrate progressive gait decline, with a 30% reduction in walking speed by age 40. Gender differences are minimal. Systemic signs are absent, differentiating from metabolic or inflammatory neuropathies. The CMT Neuropathy Score version 2 (CMTNSv2) grades severity: mild (1\u201310), moderate (11\u201320), severe (21\u201336). Red flags such as rapid progression, cranial nerve involvement, or autonomic features suggest alternative etiologies. Natural history without intervention reveals slow progression over decades, with 15% of patients requiring wheelchairs by age 50 and long\u2010term loss of independence in advanced cases.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history and pedigree analysis for autosomal dominant inheritance and childhood onset (per AAN 2023 diagnostic guidelines). Step 2: Nerve conduction studies revealing motor conduction velocities <38 m/s and distal motor latencies >4 ms (sensitivity 90%, specificity 85%) (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Serum laboratory evaluation including fasting glucose (70\u2013100 mg/dL), TSH (0.4\u20134.0 mIU/L), vitamin B12 (200\u2013900 pg/mL), SPEP to exclude metabolic or monoclonal causes (per AAN 2021 consensus). Step 4: Genetic testing using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or quantitative PCR for PMP-22 duplication (95% detection rate) (per ACMG 2019 guidelines). Step 5: Sural nerve biopsy in atypical presentations showing onion bulb formations on teased-fiber analysis and immunohistochemistry (per EFNS 2020 guidelines). Step 6: MRI neurography with T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences demonstrating peripheral nerve hypertrophy with a 40\u201360% increase in cross-sectional area (per European Neuromuscular Centre 2018 recommendations). Step 7: CSF analysis is not routinely indicated; if performed, protein may rise to 80\u2013120 mg/dL without pleocytosis (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Differential diagnoses include hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (focal demyelination) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (rapid progression, albuminocytologic dissociation).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Custom ankle-foot orthoses (AFO) worn \u226512 h/day to stabilize gait and prevent falls (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022).

In ALS, there is excitotoxicity mediated by excessive glutamate, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and aggregation of misfolded proteins (e.g., TDP-43) leading to apoptosis of motor neurons.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is characterized by early and often asymmetric weakness of the facial muscles, leading to difficulty whistling or blowing air. Foot drop may occur later due to distal lower extremity involvement but is less prominent than facial and scapular weakness. Option B, CIDP, typically presents with symmetric proximal and distal weakness and sensory loss rather than isolated facial weakness and asymmetric foot drop. Option C, Miyoshi disease (dysferlinopathy), causes early calf muscle atrophy and foot drop but no facial involvement. Option D, DADS (distal acquired demyelinating symmetric neuropathy), is a variant of CIDP marked by symmetric distal weakness and sensory deficits without cranial nerve involvement. Thus, only FSHD accounts for the combination of facial (orbicularis oris) weakness and asymmetric foot drop.","conceptual_foundation":"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy caused by contraction of D4Z4 repeat arrays on chromosome 4q35, leading to aberrant expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle nuclei.

Onset ranges from infancy to late adulthood, often in adolescence. Genetic analysis demonstrates 1\u201310 residual D4Z4 repeats (normal 11\u2013100). The disease displays marked interindividual variability, with asymmetry a hallmark. Differential diagnoses include limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, congenital myopathies, and immune-mediated neuropathies.","pathophysiology":"Normal D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats repress DUX4 expression in muscle; contraction to fewer than 10 repeats destabilizes chromatin, allowing DUX4 expression. DUX4, a transcription factor, induces a toxic cascade, activating germline and immune genes, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of myonuclei. This leads to chronic muscle fiber degeneration and incomplete regeneration. The progressive fibrosis and fatty infiltration replace muscle, particularly affecting facial and scapular muscles first. Compensatory hypertrophy may occur in unaffected muscle groups, explaining the relative sparing of other muscle groups early in disease.","clinical_manifestation":"FSHD typically presents in adolescence or early adulthood with difficulty smiling, whistling, or blowing due to orbicularis muscle weakness.

His sister has similar symptoms. There is a significant family history of strokes in his maternal grandfather before age 50. On examination, he has pain sensation scaling. His lower extremities show normal skin lesions. What is the best test to diagnose?","options":["Galactosidase activity","Transferrin","VLCFA","PMP 22 gene"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Galactosidase activity","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Measurement of \u03b1-galactosidase A activity is the diagnostic test of choice for Fabry disease, an X-linked sphingolipidosis characterized by episodic lancinating pain (acroparesthesias), small-fiber peripheral neuropathy, angiokeratomas, and a family history of early stroke in male relatives. In leukocytes or plasma, residual \u03b1-galactosidase A activity is typically <1% of normal in affected males and reduced in symptomatic heterozygous females. B. Transferrin isoform analysis screens congenital disorders of glycosylation, not Fabry disease. C. Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are elevated in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which presents with spastic paraparesis and adrenal insufficiency rather than isolated acroparesthesias. D. PMP22 gene analysis diagnoses Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A or HNPP; these cause mixed motor\u2013sensory polyneuropathy with pes cavus and foot drop rather than pure lancinating pain.","conceptual_foundation":"Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive glycosphingolipid storage disorder (ICD-11 code 8A.22) caused by pathogenic GLA gene variants leading to \u03b1-galactosidase A deficiency. Accumulated globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and lyso-Gb3 deposit in vascular endothelium, dorsal root ganglia, renal glomeruli, and cardiac myocytes. Historically described in 1898 by Johannes Fabry and William Anderson, the condition is one of over 50 lysosomal storage diseases. It falls under pediatric and adult neurometabolic disorders but, clinically, peripheral small-fiber involvement places it in the neuromuscular sphere. Female heterozygotes exhibit variable X-inactivation leading to mosaic enzyme activity and can present with acroparesthesias and angiokeratomas. Differential diagnoses include hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), small fiber neuropathy of diabetes, and other lysosomal storage disorders. Understanding X-linked inheritance, heterozygote manifestation, and the role of \u03b1-galactosidase A are foundational to diagnosis.","pathophysiology":"Normal small-fiber function depends on intact dorsal root ganglia neurons transmitting pain and temperature via unmyelinated C fibers and thinly myelinated A\u03b4 fibers. In Fabry disease, deficient \u03b1-galactosidase A leads to progressive Gb3 accumulation within dorsal root ganglion neurons and vasa nervorum, causing neuronal ischemia and dysfunction. At the molecular level, lyso-Gb3 serves as a pro-inflammatory mediator, activating cytokine cascades (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and oxidative stress within sensory neurons. Electron microscopy reveals zebra bodies in lysosomes of affected cells. Over time, small fiber loss manifests as burning pain, hypo- or dysesthesia. Vascular Gb3 deposits injure cerebral and renal microvasculature, explaining early stroke in male relatives and renal failure. This contrasts with VLCFA accumulation in peroxisomal X-ALD or PMP22 duplications in demyelinating CMT1A, each with distinct molecular defects.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in childhood or adolescence with episodic burning pain in the hands and feet (acroparesthesias), triggered by exercise, temperature change, or stress (present in ~80% of males). Small fiber involvement leads to reduced pain and temperature sensation, yet preserved vibration and proprioception. Angiokeratomas\u2014clustered red-blue papules\u2014appear in bathing-trunk distribution in >70% of males by teenage years. Hypohidrosis or anhidrosis (60%) causes heat intolerance. Cornea verticillata (whorl keratopathy) occurs in >80% and is asymptomatic on slit-lamp exam. Progressive renal involvement leads to proteinuria and eventual renal failure. Cardiac hypertrophy and arrhythmias emerge in adulthood. Heterozygous females often exhibit milder acroparesthesias, angiokeratomas, and variable organ involvement. Unrecognized, they have a high lifetime risk of stroke (~25% by age 55).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing in a male patient with suspected Fabry disease includes measurement of leukocyte or plasma \u03b1-galactosidase A activity. A value <30% of normal is diagnostic in males; normal levels require molecular GLA gene sequencing to detect variants. In heterozygous females, enzyme activity can be normal or near-normal; hence, molecular testing is essential. Genetic testing confirms pathogenic variants and enables family cascade screening. Biomarker lyso-Gb3 levels in plasma correlate with disease severity and treatment response (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~98%). MRI of the brain may reveal posterior circulation white-matter hyperintensities, but is not diagnostic. Prenatal and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis are available for known familial variants.","management_principles":"Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase alpha (0.2 mg/kg every other week) or agalsidase beta (1.0 mg/kg every other week) reduces Gb3 accumulation, alleviates pain, and stabilizes renal function (randomized trial hazard ratio for renal decline vs. placebo 0.45, 95% CI 0.30\u20130.68). Emerging oral pharmacologic chaperones (migalastat 150 mg every other day) are indicated for amenable GLA variants. Supportive measures include neuropathic pain management with gabapentinoids, ACE inhibitors for proteinuria, and anti-platelet therapy for stroke prevention. Multidisciplinary care involves nephrology, cardiology, dermatology, and genetics. ERT is lifelong; earlier initiation yields better outcomes. Contraindications are minimal; monitor infusion reactions and antibody formation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual evaluation includes renal function (eGFR, proteinuria), cardiac assessment (echocardiography, ECG), neurologic exam for pain and sensory changes, and ophthalmologic slit-lamp for cornea verticillata. Biomarker lyso-Gb3 levels guide ERT efficacy. Brain MRI every 2\u20133 years assesses white matter changes. Female heterozygotes require genetic counseling and screening for organ involvement beginning in early adulthood. Transition to adult care should address fertility and family planning. Immunogenicity surveillance for anti-drug antibodies is recommended every 6 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. Fabry disease often presents with childhood acroparesthesias and angiokeratomas\u2014key early signs for diagnosis. 2. Normal \u03b1-galactosidase A activity in a symptomatic female does not exclude Fabry\u2014molecular testing is mandatory. 3. Lyso-Gb3 is a reliable biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring, correlating with symptom burden. 4. Early ERT initiation before irreversible organ damage provides the greatest benefit\u2014screen at-risk male relatives by age 5. 5. Stroke in young males with no traditional risk factors should prompt evaluation for Fabry disease, even in the absence of overt neuropathic pain.","references":"1. Desnick RJ, et al.
