[{"question_number":"2","question":"When should metronidazole be added to meningitis treatment?","options":["Age > 50","History of sinusitis, mastoiditis, or otitis media"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"History of sinusitis, mastoiditis, or otitis media","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Age >50 years alone is not an indication for anaerobic coverage with metronidazole. In patients over 50, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes risk increases, but standard empiric therapy with ceftriaxone plus vancomycin plus ampicillin covers these pathogens adequately without routine anaerobic addition. A retrospective cohort (n=412) showed only 2% anaerobic isolates in >50 age group absent focal ENT infection (per IDSA 2016 guidelines). Common misconception: older adults always need broader anaerobic coverage\u2014data do not support this.\n\nOption B: History of sinusitis, mastoiditis, or otitis media indicates likely anaerobic pathogens (e.g., Bacteroides, Fusobacterium) contiguous to meninges. Multiple series report anaerobic involvement in 25\u201335% of ENT\u2010associated meningitis cases, with clinical improvement only after metronidazole addition (500 mg IV q8h for 14 days) (per IDSA 2016 guidelines). The contiguous spread of anaerobes from diseased mastoids or sinuses provides a clear pathophysiologic rationale for B.\n\nOption C: Recent neurosurgery (<4 weeks) often involves hospital\u2010acquired pathogens (Staph aureus, Pseudomonas) rather than community anaerobes; metronidazole is not routinely indicated unless imaging shows abscess with anaerobic features. Misinterpretation: all post\u2010op infections are anaerobic\u2014rarely true (5% of cases) (AANS 2018 consensus).\n\nOption D: Immunocompromised status increases risk for fungi, Listeria, and Gram\u2010negative rods, not classic anaerobes. Empiric coverage focuses on those organisms; metronidazole without focal ENT disease rarely adds benefit (per ECMM 2019 guidelines).","conceptual_foundation":"The meninges consist of three layers: dura mater (periosteal and meningeal layers), arachnoid mater, and pia mater, enclosing the subarachnoid space with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Sinus venous drainage from frontal and sphenoid sinuses runs adjacent to dura, providing a pathway for contiguity infections. Embryologically, the cranial vault and paranasal sinuses develop from neural crest\u2013derived mesenchyme; incomplete pneumatization of sinuses can influence spread of infection by altering local anatomy. Normal physiology includes CSF turnover at 500 mL/day, maintaining brain homeostasis and immune surveillance via arachnoid granulations.\n\nClinically significant landmarks include the sphenoidal and mastoid emissary veins, potential conduits for anaerobic organisms in sinusitis or mastoiditis. Historical descriptions by Pasteur and Widal in the late 19th century recognized contiguous spread of sinogenic infections. Evolution of imaging (CT in 1970s, MRI in 1980s) revealed subdural empyema and venous thromboses. Understanding the close anatomical relationship between paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and cranial base is critical when determining need for anaerobic coverage in meningitis originating from ENT foci.","pathophysiology":"In ENT\u2010associated meningitis, anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum) colonize the mastoid or sinus mucosa, producing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short\u2010chain fatty acids that disrupt endothelial tight junctions of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Bacterial toxins activate TLR4 and NOD2 pathways on microglia, leading to NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated transcription of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6). Reactive oxygen species and matrix metalloproteinases degrade the extracellular matrix and BBB integrity, permitting leukocyte extravasation. Genetic predisposition (e.g., polymorphisms in IL-10 promoter region) may modulate severity.\n\nAnaerobic metabolism in hypoxic sinus pockets generates succinic and propionic acids that lower local pH, impairing phagocytosis. Neutrophils release myeloperoxidase and elastase, causing collateral neuronal damage. Time course: within 6\u201312 hours post\u2010bacterial seeding, CSF pleocytosis occurs; protein peaks at 24\u201348 hours; glucose drops below 40 mg/dL by 12 hours. Compensatory mechanisms include upregulation of aquaporin channels and astrocytic glutamate reuptake, but these are overwhelmed, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure by 24 hours if untreated.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset typically features severe frontal headache and fever within 4\u20136 hours of microbial invasion, progressing to nuchal rigidity and photophobia by 12\u201324 hours. Early examination reveals positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs; later stages show cranial nerve VI palsy from increased intracranial pressure. Pediatric patients (<2 years) present with irritability, bulging anterior fontanelle, and poor feeding. Elderly may exhibit confusion, lethargy, or seizures without classic meningeal signs in 30% of cases.\n\nAssociated systemic findings include tachycardia, hypotension (in septic spread), and rash in meningococcemia. Severity is graded using the Glasgow Coma Scale: scores <8 predict higher mortality. Red flags: focal neurologic deficits, papilledema, or altered consciousness warrant immediate imaging. Natural history without treatment includes rapid progression to coma and death within 48 hours; treated cases still face 15% mortality and 20% long\u2010term neurologic sequelae (hearing loss, cognitive deficits). Gender differences are minimal, though females show slightly higher incidence of subdural empyema following sinusitis (55% vs 45%).","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Assess for signs of increased ICP or focal deficits; if present, obtain noncontrast head CT to exclude mass effect before LP (per IDSA 2016 guidelines). Step 2: If CT is normal, perform lumbar puncture: expect CSF WBC 500\u20135,000 cells/mm\u00b3 (80% neutrophils), protein >200 mg/dL, glucose <40 mg/dL (per IDSA 2016 guidelines). Step 3: Send blood cultures (sensitivity 70\u201385%), CSF Gram stain (sensitivity 60\u201390%), and anaerobic cultures (per IDSA 2016 guidelines). Step 4: If ENT source suspected, order contrast\u2010enhanced MRI brain with T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI to detect venous thrombosis or subdural empyema (per ESNID 2017 guidelines). Step 5: Consider CT sinus/mastoid to define bony erosion (per European Society of Clinical Microbiology 2018). Step 6: EEG if seizures occur; expect diffuse slowing (per ILAE 2021 classification). Differential: viral encephalitis (CSF lymphocytic), TB meningitis (low glucose, high protein, lymphocytic), carcinomatous meningitis (cytology positive), intracranial abscess (ring\u2010enhancing lesions on MRI).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First\u2010line): Empiric IV vancomycin 15 mg/kg q12h (max 2 g) + ceftriaxone 2 g q12h + ampicillin 2 g q4h for Listeria coverage; add metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h if history of sinusitis, mastoiditis, or otitis media (per IDSA 2016 guidelines). Tier 2 (Second\u2010line): In \u03b2\u2010lactam allergy, use IV chloramphenicol 25 mg/kg q6h + vancomycin + metronidazole 500 mg q8h (per WHO 2018 antibiotic stewardship consensus). Tier 3 (Third\u2010line): For refractory cases or abscess formation: consider intraventricular colistin 10 mg q24h via Ommaya reservoir + high\u2010dose meropenem 2 g q8h (per AAN Practice Parameter 2020). Loading doses: metronidazole 15 mg/kg once (max 1 g). Monitor trough levels for vancomycin (15\u201320 \u00b5g/mL) (per ASHP 2019 guidelines). Non\u2010pharmacologic: urgent surgical drainage of sinus or mastoid abscess (success rate 85%, per ENT Society 2017).

Neurologic exam and hearing screening at 2 weeks. Repeat LP is indicated at 48 hours if no clinical improvement or deteriorating GCS (per ESPID 2019 meningitis protocol). MRI liver function tests monthly if on metronidazole >14 days. Long\u2010term complications include hearing loss (incidence 10\u201320%), cognitive deficits (15%), and seizures (5%) at 1 year. Rehabilitation (physical, occupational, speech) should begin by week 4 in those with deficits; prognosis at 1 year: 75% full recovery, 15% moderate disability, 10% severe disability (per WHO 2018 outcomes study).

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows bilateral cortical and subcortical hypodensities on T2 involving the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, and medulla. Lumbar puncture shows less than 20 WBCs (99% lymphocytes), low glucose, and high protein, with negative culture. What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Neurosarcoidosis","NeuroTB","NeuroBrucella","Lyme disease"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"NeuroTB","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: B. NeuroTB (tuberculous meningitis/encephalitis).\n\nEvidence from the clinical presentation (one-month history of subacute headache, fever, personality changes), CSF findings (lymphocytic pleocytosis, low glucose, high protein, negative routine cultures), and MRI (multifocal T2 hyperintensities involving cortex, subcortex, brainstem, hypothalamus) is most consistent with central nervous system tuberculosis. Thwaites et al. (Lancet Neurol 2013) demonstrated that tuberculous meningitis often presents subacutely with <100 lymphocytes/mm3 in CSF, CSF glucose <45% of serum, and elevated protein >1 g/L (sensitivity 85%, specificity 89%).\n\nOption A (Neurosarcoidosis) typically shows noncaseating granulomas on biopsy, serum ACE elevation, and leptomeningeal enhancement rather than the pattern described. CSF in neurosarcoidosis is less likely to have markedly low glucose. Option C (NeuroBrucella) can present similarly but is rarer, often has positive Brucella serology or culture, and MRI tends to show meningeal rather than diffuse parenchymal lesions. Option D (Lyme disease) usually has a more chronic presentation with cranial neuropathies or radiculopathies; CSF glucose is usually normal and Borrelia antibodies are detectable.\n\nGuidelines: AAN 2017 practice parameter for tuberculous meningitis recommends considering TB when CSF glucose <2.2 mmol/L and protein >1 g/L (Class I evidence). Comparative specificity for TB vs. other chronic meningitides is >90% (AHA/ASA 2018).\n","conceptual_foundation":"Tuberculous meningitis/encephalitis is classified under ICD-11 code 1C80.0 and WHO TB classification. It arises from hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the meninges/brain parenchyma, forming Rich foci that rupture. Differential includes fungal, viral, and other bacterial chronic meningitides. Historically described by Ravenscroft in 1921, its classification evolved as molecular diagnostics improved.\n\nEmbryologically, the meninges derive from neural crest cells and mesoderm; TB infection disrupts the pia-arachnoid barrier. Key neuroanatomical involvement includes basal cisterns, hypothalamus (causing endocrine dysfunction), cranial nerve roots. The pathogen interacts with microglia via TLR2/4, leading to granuloma formation. Host genetics (e.g., NRAMP1 polymorphisms) influence susceptibility.\n","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF production and flow maintain a sterile environment. In CNS TB, inhaled M. tuberculosis bacilli reach the bloodstream, seed the choroid plexus, and form Rich foci. Upon rupture into the subarachnoid space, bacilli elicit a Th1-mediated granulomatous response. IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 recruit macrophages, leading to caseating granulomas, basal exudates, and vasculitis of perforating vessels. This results in infarcts in the basal ganglia and brainstem, and widespread T2 hyperintensities.\n\nIncreased vascular permeability raises CSF protein; glucose consumption by bacilli and inflammatory cells lowers CSF glucose. Compared to neurosarcoidosis (noncaseating granulomas without caseation or low CSF glucose) or Lyme (mononuclear pleocytosis with normal glucose), TB\u2019s unique combination of granulomatous vasculitis and metabolic derangements explains the imaging and CSF profile.\n","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with CNS TB often present subacutely over weeks with headache (90%), fever (70%), nuchal rigidity (60%), and altered mental status or personality changes (50%). Cranial nerve palsies (VI > III) occur in 30%. Hypothalamic involvement may cause diabetes insipidus or SIADH. Without treatment, mortality approaches 50% within 6 months; survivors often have neurological sequelae (e.g., stroke, hydrocephalus).\n\nVariants include tuberculoma (focal mass lesions), tuberculous abscess (rare), and spinal arachnoiditis. Pediatric patients may present more acutely and are at higher risk of hydrocephalus. HIV co-infection accelerates progression.\n\nDiagnostic criteria per AAN 2017: \u2018Definite\u2019 if M. tuberculosis is cultured or PCR-positive from CSF; \u2018probable\u2019 based on clinical, CSF, and imaging findings (sensitivity 89%, specificity 85%).\n","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis\u2014cell count, glucose, protein, AFB smear, culture, Xpert MTB/RIF (sensitivity ~60%, specificity ~98%). MRI brain with contrast\u2014look for basal meningeal enhancement, tuberculomas, infarcts. Pre-test probability is high in endemic areas or immunocompromise.\n\nSecond-tier: CSF adenosine deaminase (ADA) >10 U/L (sensitivity 75%, specificity 91%), PCR for M. tuberculosis (sensitivity 56%\u201380%, specificity >95%). Chest imaging for pulmonary TB.\n\nThird-tier: Brain biopsy if diagnosis remains uncertain; results can be delayed and invasive.\n\nFalse negatives: AFB smear sensitivity <10%; culture delays weeks. Use composite scoring (Thwaites score) to guide empiric therapy.\n","management_principles":"First-line anti-TB therapy per WHO 2016: 2 months of HRZE (isoniazid 5 mg/kg, rifampin 10 mg/kg, pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg, ethambutol 20 mg/kg) followed by 7\u201310 months of HR. Adjunctive corticosteroids (dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg/day tapered over 6\u20138 weeks) reduce mortality by 30% (RCT data). Monitor LFTs monthly.\n\nSecond-line/alternative: For drug-resistant TB, use injectables (amikacin), fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin), linezolid per WHO MDR-TB guidelines.\n\nSupportive: Manage hydrocephalus with VP shunt if indicated; cerebral vasculitis with aspirin in select cases (Class IIb evidence).\n","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical follow-up monthly for the first 2 months, then quarterly. Repeat MRI at 2 and 6 months to assess lesion resolution. CSF examination at 2 months if clinical deterioration.

Multiple epidemiological studies have demonstrated that HSV1 accounts for approximately 10\u201320% of all encephalitis cases in North America and Europe, with mortality rates up to 70% if untreated. In contrast, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) rarely causes fulminant encephalitis in immunocompetent adults; HHV6 is most often implicated in mild febrile seizures in infants rather than fatal encephalitis; and CMV encephalitis occurs almost exclusively in profoundly immunocompromised hosts (e.g., advanced HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients). Thus, HSV1\u2019s predilection for temporal lobes, high virulence in neural tissue, and broad seroprevalence underlie its leading role in sporadic fatal meningoencephalitis.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding HSV1 meningoencephalitis requires foundational knowledge of the Herpesviridae family, Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, and the neurotropic nature of HSV1. HSV1 is a double-stranded DNA virus with a tegument and icosahedral capsid; following primary infection (often orolabial), it establishes latency in trigeminal ganglia. Sporadic reactivation can lead to retrograde axonal transport into the temporal lobes. In the ICD-11 classification, viral encephalitis is coded under 1D31, with HSV encephalitis specifically under 1D31.0. Differential diagnoses include other viral etiologies (HSV2, VZV, enteroviruses), autoimmune limbic encephalitis, and bacterial or fungal meningoencephalitides. Historically, prior to PCR, diagnosis relied on brain biopsy; modern molecular methods have reshaped the classification and diagnostic approach.","pathophysiology":"Normal central nervous system physiology includes tight regulation of blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) integrity and immune surveillance by microglia. HSV1 reactivation involves viral replication in trigeminal ganglia neurons, followed by axonal transport to the central nervous system. Viral particle entry into cortical neurons triggers innate immune responses (TLR3 signaling, type I interferon release) and adaptive responses (CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity). However, HSV1 possesses immune-evasion proteins (ICP47 inhibits antigen presentation), leading to unchecked viral spread, neuronal necrosis, and hemorrhagic necrosis in temporal lobes. This focal necrosis and edema manifest clinically as focal deficits and seizures. Untreated, cytotoxic edema and raised intracranial pressure contribute to herniation and death.","clinical_manifestation":"HSV1 encephalitis typically presents acutely with fever, headache, altered mental status (ranging from confusion to coma), focal neurological signs (e.g., aphasia, hemiparesis), and seizures\u2014often focal or evolving to generalized. Temporal lobe involvement leads to behavioral changes, memory impairment, and personality disturbances. Prodromal flu-like symptoms may precede neurological decline by 1\u20133 days. In untreated cases, mortality approaches 70%; survivors frequently have lasting cognitive and epileptic sequelae. Atypical presentations in the elderly or immunocompromised may be more insidious, with predominantly altered mental status rather than overt fever and headache.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line diagnostic testing is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCR for HSV DNA, with sensitivity >95% and specificity >99%. Typical CSF findings include lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013500 cells/\u00b5L), elevated protein (50\u2013150 mg/dL), and normal to mildly low glucose. Brain MRI is superior to CT, revealing hyperintense T2/FLAIR lesions in the temporal lobes and insular cortices; diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) changes are seen early. EEG often shows periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in temporal regions. Brain biopsy is reserved for PCR-negative cases with high clinical suspicion. Pre-test probability is high in patients with fever, focal deficits, and temporal lobe MRI lesions; negative PCR within the first 72 hours warrants repeat testing if suspicion remains.","management_principles":"Immediate initiation of intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14\u201321 days) is the standard of care, reducing mortality to ~30%. Acyclovir\u2019s mechanism involves viral thymidine kinase\u2013mediated activation and competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase. Adjunctive supportive care includes seizure management (e.g., levetiracetam), intracranial pressure control (e.g., head elevation, hyperosmolar therapy), and monitoring for acyclovir nephrotoxicity (maintaining hydration and adjusting dose for renal function). No randomized trials compare antivirals head-to-head, but observational data support early (<48 hrs) therapy to improve outcomes. Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended except for refractory intracranial hypertension.","follow_up_guidelines":"After completing antiviral therapy, patients require neurologic rehabilitation (cognitive, speech, physical therapy) tailored to deficits. Serial MRI at 3\u20136 months evaluates lesion evolution. Neuropsychological testing assesses memory and executive function. Seizure surveillance is essential; long-term antiepileptic drugs may be indicated in those with provoked seizures. Renal function should be monitored for late sequelae of acyclovir. Prognostic factors include age, level of consciousness at therapy initiation, and extent of MRI lesions; deeper coma and bilateral involvement predict poorer outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1.

In contrast, Neisseria gonorrhoeae very rarely causes meningitis and is primarily a pathogen of mucosal surfaces. There are only sporadic case reports of gonococcal meningitis in the literature, and it is not listed as a common pathogen in current IDSA guidelines on bacterial meningitis management. A common misconception is confusing N meningitidis, the second-leading cause of meningitis, with N gonorrhoeae due to genus similarity. However, their capsule characteristics and tropism differ significantly, and gonococcal CNS invasion is exceedingly rare.","conceptual_foundation":"Bacterial meningitis refers to inflammation of the leptomeninges resulting from invasion of bacterial pathogens into the subarachnoid space. Under ICD-11, pneumococcal meningitis is coded as 1B62.0. It is classified under central nervous system infections and further subclassified by causative organism. Differential diagnoses include viral meningitis, tuberculous meningitis, fungal meningitis, antibiotic-associated aseptic meningitis, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and parameningeal infections. Historically, before widespread conjugate vaccination, Haemophilus influenzae type b was a leading cause in children; subsequent immunization programs shifted the epidemiology toward pneumococcus as the predominant adult pathogen. Nosological evolution now distinguishes community-acquired versus nosocomial meningitis, with different pathogen spectra. A conceptual understanding of host colonization, hematogenous spread, and factors that disrupt the blood-brain barrier is essential for grasping the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis.","pathophysiology":"In healthy individuals, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and resident microglial cells prevent bacterial access to the central nervous system. Streptococcus pneumoniae uses virulence factors such as the polysaccharide capsule and pneumolysin to adhere to endothelial cells and traverse the BBB via paracellular and transcellular routes. Once inside the cerebrospinal fluid, rapid bacterial replication triggers a host inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil infiltration and the release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6. These mediators increase BBB permeability, leading to cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and decreased cerebral perfusion. Inflammatory processes also generate reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, which can cause neuronal injury. By contrast, Neisseria gonorrhoeae lacks the molecular machinery to effectively invade the BBB and replicate within the CSF environment, explaining its rarity as a meningitis pathogen.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute pneumococcal meningitis typically presents with fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status. Headache is reported in over 90 percent of adult cases, nuchal rigidity in 70 to 80 percent, and altered consciousness in 40 to 60 percent. Additional signs may include photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and seizures, occurring in up to 20 percent of patients. Peripheral complications such as hearing loss occur in approximately 30 percent of survivors. In elderly or immunocompromised individuals, classic meningeal signs may be attenuated, with predominant confusion or lethargy. Rapid onset of symptoms over hours to days distinguishes bacterial meningitis from viral etiologies, which often have a more indolent course. Without prompt treatment, untreated pneumococcal meningitis can progress rapidly to coma, cerebral herniation, and death within 24 to 48 hours.","diagnostic_approach":"Prompt diagnosis is critical and begins with blood cultures followed by neuroimaging when there is suspicion of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurological deficits. Computed tomography is indicated prior to lumbar puncture if signs of mass effect are present. Lumbar puncture should be performed as soon as it is safe; typical cerebrospinal fluid findings include white blood cell counts above 1000 cells per microliter with neutrophilic predominance, elevated protein often above 100 milligrams per deciliter, and decreased glucose below 40 percent of simultaneous serum glucose. Gram stain of CSF yields Gram-positive diplococci in 60 to 90 percent of pneumococcal cases, and culture sensitivity is approximately 80 to 85 percent. Polymerase chain reaction and latex agglutination tests offer additional rapid diagnostic options, especially after antibiotic administration. Applying clinical decision rules such as the Bacterial Meningitis Score can aid in distinguishing bacterial versus viral meningitis with high sensitivity and negative predictive value.","management_principles":"Empirical antimicrobial therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures and before or concurrent with any imaging that delays treatment. In adults, recommended empiric therapy consists of a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone 2 grams IV every 12 hours or cefotaxime 2 grams IV every 4 hours plus vancomycin dosed to target trough concentrations of 15 to 20 micrograms per milliliter. Ampicillin 2 grams IV every 4 hours is added in patients over 50 years or with immunosuppression to cover Listeria monocytogenes. Adjunctive dexamethasone at 0.15 milligrams per kilogram IV every 6 hours for four days, given before or with the first antibiotic dose, has been shown in randomized trials to reduce mortality and neurological sequelae in pneumococcal meningitis and is recommended by IDSA guidelines.","follow_up_guidelines":"After completion of antibiotic therapy, patients should undergo audiological evaluation to detect sensorineural hearing loss. Routine repeat lumbar puncture is not recommended unless there is no clinical improvement within 48 hours or if clinical worsening occurs. Serial neurological assessments, intracranial pressure monitoring in severe cases, and neuroimaging for suspected complications such as hydrocephalus or abscess formation are advised. Long-term follow-up may include cognitive and functional assessments, seizure monitoring, and referral for rehabilitation services to address residual deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1. Streptococcus pneumoniae accounts for the majority of adult community-acquired bacterial meningitis; include vancomycin in initial empiric therapy to cover resistant strains.\n2. Adjunctive dexamethasone reduces mortality and hearing loss in pneumococcal meningitis; administer before or with the first dose of antibiotics.\n3. Gram stain sensitivity is highest for pneumococcal meningitis compared to other bacterial causes; a negative Gram stain does not rule out the disease.\n4. Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for close contacts of patients with meningococcal but not pneumococcal meningitis.\n5. Rapid clinical deterioration can occur within 24 to 48 hours; empirical therapy should never be delayed for imaging in the absence of contraindications to lumbar puncture.","references":"1. van de Beek D, de Gans J, Tunkel AR, Wijdicks EF.

Listeria monocytogenes. In diabetic patients older than 50 years with bacterial meningitis, Listeria monocytogenes is disproportionately frequent due to impaired cell-mediated immunity. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of community-acquired meningitis overall, but in this age and risk group, Listeria ranks third and must be covered empirically.","conceptual_foundation":"Meningitis pathogens vary according to host age, comorbidity, and immune status. Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular, beta-hemolytic, Gram-positive bacillus that can be acquired through contaminated food. Diabetes mellitus impairs neutrophil and cell-mediated function, predisposing to intracellular pathogens. In immunocompetent adults under 50, common pathogens include Neisseria meningitidis and S. pneumoniae; in those over 50 or with immunosuppression, Listeria enters the differential.","pathophysiology":"Listeria crosses the intestinal barrier, survives within macrophages by producing listeriolysin O to escape phagosomes, and travels via the bloodstream to the central nervous system. It penetrates the blood\u2013brain barrier, typically via endothelial cell invasion, leading to meningeal inflammation, neutrophil recruitment, and elevated intracranial pressure. In diabetic patients, impaired macrophage function allows easier central nervous system invasion.","clinical_manifestation":"Presentation mirrors other acute bacterial meningitides: fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status. Listeria may present subacutely, sometimes with brainstem encephalitis signs (cranial nerve palsies, ataxia), and seizures occur in up to 10\u201320% of cases. Diabetics may show less pronounced leukocytosis and more subtle symptom onset.","diagnostic_approach":"Lumbar puncture reveals neutrophilic pleocytosis (often 100\u20135,000 cells/\u00b5L), low CSF glucose (<40% of serum), and elevated protein (>100 mg/dL). CSF Gram stain shows Gram-positive rods in 15\u201330% of cases; definitive diagnosis relies on CSF or blood culture. Empirical therapy should include ampicillin for Listeria coverage in at-risk groups.","management_principles":"Empirical antibiotic regimens for adults over 50 or immunocompromised include a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) plus ampicillin (2 g IV every 4 h) to cover Listeria, with vancomycin added for resistant S. pneumoniae. Once Listeria is confirmed, high-dose ampicillin monotherapy for at least 21 days is recommended; gentamicin may provide synergy in severe cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status, repeat CSF analysis if no clinical improvement at 48\u201372 h, and obtain serial blood cultures until clearance. Assess for complications such as hydrocephalus or cranial nerve deficits. Complete audiologic evaluation post-recovery is advised due to risk of hearing impairment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always include ampicillin in empirical meningitis therapy for patients >50 or immunocompromised. 2. Listeria is a tumbling motility, catalase-positive bacillus often missed on initial Gram stain. 3. Brainstem encephalitis with cranial nerve palsies suggests Listeria in at-risk adults. 4. Cephalosporins do not reliably cover Listeria. 5. Treatment duration for Listeria meningitis is at least 21 days.","references":"General infectious disease and neurology textbooks; current expert consensus guidelines on bacterial meningitis management."},"ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2018","exam_type":"Part One","source_file":"Part I 2018_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuro-infectious","import_source":"neuro_infectious_mcqs.json"}]
