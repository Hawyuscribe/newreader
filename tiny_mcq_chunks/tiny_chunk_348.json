Ischemic forearm test. This test evaluates muscle lactate production during exercise under ischemic conditions and is the diagnostic gold standard for metabolic myopathies such as McArdle disease, which typically present with exercise-induced cramps and fatigue that improve with rest. Evidence from multiple case series (DiMauro et al. 2018; Lucia et al. 2017) shows that patients with glycogen storage disease type V have a blunted rise in lactate and an exaggerated rise in ammonia compared to controls. Option A (MRI) is nonspecific for metabolic muscle disease and is used primarily for structural lesions. Option C (NCS) evaluates peripheral nerve conduction and would be normal in primary muscle metabolic disorders. Option D (serum CK) may be elevated but is neither sensitive nor specific for exercise-induced cramps and does not distinguish between etiologies.","conceptual_foundation":"Exercise-induced muscle cramps that resolve with rest are characteristic of intermittent claudication in vascular disease but in a young patient without vascular risk factors suggest a metabolic myopathy. McArdle disease (glycogen storage disease type V) is due to myophosphorylase deficiency (gene PYGM) leading to impaired glycogenolysis. Under ICD-11 this falls under congenital metabolic muscle disorders. Differential includes mitochondrial myopathies, membrane excitability disorders, and peripheral vascular disease. Embryologically, skeletal muscle derives from somites, with metabolic enzyme expression regulated by transcription factors such as PGC-1\u03b1. Muscle fiber type I and II distribution affects exercise tolerance. Glycogen deposition is prominent in type II fibers, leading to earlier fatigue.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle contraction relies on glycogenolysis to produce ATP during early high-intensity exercise. In McArdle disease, deficiency of myophosphorylase prevents mobilization of muscle glycogen, leading to energy failure in working fibers. This manifests as pain and cramps within one to three minutes of exertion. Cellularly, ATP depletion causes ionic pump failure, membrane depolarization, and activation of nociceptors. Ammonia accumulates via adenylate deaminase pathway. Compensatory increase in oxidative phosphorylation during rest partially restores ATP, allowing exercise resumption (\u2018\u2018second wind\u2019\u2019 phenomenon).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present in adolescence or early adulthood with exercise-induced muscle pain, cramps, and early fatigue. The hallmark is improvement with brief rest (second wind). CK levels may be mildly elevated chronically but spike after intense exercise. There is no true muscle weakness at rest. Natural history shows stable course with risk of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. Formal diagnosis requires the ischemic forearm test or genetic testing for PYGM mutations.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: ischemic forearm test measuring blood lactate and ammonia before and after exercise under cuff ischemia. A flat lactate curve with a rise in ammonia is diagnostic (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~98%). CK and routine bloods are adjunctive. Second-tier: genetic testing for PYGM with ~100% specificity. Third tier: muscle biopsy showing subsarcolemmal glycogen accumulation. EMG may show myotonic discharges post-exercise but is nonspecific.","management_principles":"No specific enzyme replacement is available. Management includes education to use the second-wind phenomenon, moderate aerobic warm-up, and avoidance of intense isometric exercise. High-protein, moderate-carbohydrate diet and oral sucrose before exercise improve tolerance (Class IIa, Level B evidence). Carnitine supplementation has limited benefit. Monitor for rhabdomyolysis and maintain hydration.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual follow-up with CK and renal function, exercise tolerance assessment, and nutritional review. Educate on early recognition of rhabdomyolysis and maintain baseline activity to preserve conditioning. Transition to adult metabolic specialists as needed.","clinical_pearls":"1. McArdle disease shows a \u2018\u2018second-wind\u2019\u2019 improvement with aerobic exercise. 2. Ischemic forearm test is positive when lactate fails to rise. 3.

Sensory nerves remain intact in primary familial forms owing to selective calcium and sodium channel dysfunction in skeletal muscle. Rare sensory changes occur only when prolonged immobility causes compressive neuropathy, making pure sensory or sensorimotor overlap clinically negligible.\n\nOption B: Subacute flaccid quadriplegia can manifest as purely motor, purely sensory (rarely 10 percent of cases), or mixed deficits in 35\u201360 percent of patients with conditions such as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy or transverse myelitis. Motor involvement arises from ventral horn or root pathology, sensory involvement from dorsal root lesions. Electrophysiological profiles confirm combined fiber type injury in 45 percent of subacute cases.\n\nOption C: Malignant hyperthermia is a hypermetabolic crisis of skeletal muscle triggered by volatile anesthetics or succinylcholine with rigidity, hyperthermia (>40 \u00b0C), tachycardia, and acidosis. It lacks primary sensory fiber involvement as the pathology resides at the ryanodine receptor in sarcoplasmic reticulum, not peripheral nerves.\n\nOption D: Myotonia causes delayed muscle relaxation, stiffness, and percussion responses due to CLCN1 or SCN4A channel mutations. It produces no true sensory loss; any discomfort arises from muscle spindle activation, not neuropathic sensory deficits. Misinterpretation of stiffness as paresthesia leads to confusion with sensorimotor syndromes.\n\nThe pathophysiological basis of subacute flaccid quadriplegia involves central or peripheral demyelination or inflammation affecting both dorsal and ventral roots, accounting for its pure motor, pure sensory, or mixed presentations. Common misconceptions include attributing all quadriplegia to motor pathways alone without considering dorsal root involvement, or confusing metabolic myopathies for neuropathic paralysis. Studies show that 60 percent of transverse myelitis patients have combined deficits (Kiernan et al. Neurology 2019), underscoring option B as definitively correct.","conceptual_foundation":"Subacute flaccid quadriplegia implicates multiple anatomical structures, including anterior horn cells in the cervical spinal cord, ventral and dorsal roots exiting at C4\u2013C8, and corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts. Lesions may involve the gray matter, dorsal columns, or peripheral nerves. Embryologically, motor neurons derive from the basal plate, sensory from the alar plate, explaining selective vulnerabilities. Normal regulation requires coordinated firing of alpha motor neurons in Rexed lamina IX and sensory feedback via dorsal root ganglia.\n\nKey brainstem nuclei such as the nucleus solitarius and trigeminal sensory nucleus integrate sensory modalities, although classic flaccid quadriplegia spares brainstem unless ascending myelitis occurs. Historical descriptions by Guillain and Barr\u00e9 highlighted segmental demyelination of anterior and posterior roots. Subsequent studies refined the concept of sensorimotor radiculoneuropathy. Clinical significance rests on identifying anatomical landmarks: the anterior median fissure demarcates motor versus sensory tract localization, and the posterolateral sulcus indicates dorsal root entry. Related conditions include acute transverse myelitis, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and combined central-peripheral inflammatory syndromes. The evolution from purely motor to combined deficits reflects advances in MRI tractography and high-resolution nerve imaging, enhancing topographical diagnosis and guiding targeted interventions.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, subacute flaccid quadriplegia often stems from autoimmune-mediated demyelination or axonal injury. Antiganglioside antibodies (anti-GM1, anti-GD1a) bind to nodes of Ranvier, activating complement cascade and macrophage infiltration. Ion channel dysfunction, including sodium and potassium channel redistribution, impairs salutatory conduction. Cellular signaling involves upregulation of NF-kB, interleukin-6, and TNF-alpha, promoting inflammation across the blood\u2013nerve barrier.\n\nGenetic predisposition includes HLA-DR2 associations in idiopathic transverse myelitis. Haploinsufficiency of complement regulatory proteins such as CD55 accelerates myelin injury. Metabolic demands increase, requiring ATP for Na+/K+ ATPase to maintain resting potential. Energy depletion over 7\u201314 days leads to Wallerian degeneration. Compensatory mechanisms include collateral sprouting and remyelination by Schwann cells, often limited by fibrotic scarring. Time course: acute inflammatory infiltration peaks at day 5, demyelination by day 10, early remyelination by week 3. Failure of repair triggers chronic axonal loss and gliosis. In parainfectious and paraneoplastic forms, immune complexes perpetuate damage, requiring aggressive immunomodulation.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms typically develop subacutely over 2 to 14 days, with initial paresthesia in hands or feet progressing proximally to involve all four limbs. Peak weakness occurs around day 7 in 75 percent of cases. Neurological examination reveals symmetric flaccid paralysis graded 0/5 to 2/5 on the Medical Research Council scale, decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes in 85 percent of patients, and variable sensory loss in 10\u201360 percent.\n\nPediatric patients often present with pain and fever, while adults more commonly report progressive weakness without systemic signs. Elderly individuals may exhibit autonomic dysfunction such as orthostatic hypotension and urinary retention in 30 percent of cases. Gender differences are minimal, though women have a slight predilection for transverse myelitis. Associated systemic features include low-grade fever, elevated ESR, and mild leukocytosis. Severity is graded using the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 disability scale: 0 (healthy) to 6 (death). Red flags include bulbar involvement, respiratory compromise, and rapid spread beyond 4 days. Without treatment, natural history leads to nadir at 2 weeks and partial spontaneous recovery in 50 percent over six months.","diagnostic_approach":"Begin with complete blood count, metabolic panel, ESR, CRP to exclude metabolic and inflammatory mimics per AAN 2023 guidelines. Obtain MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine with T1, T2, STIR, and gadolinium sequences to identify root enhancement or cord lesions (sensitivity 90 percent, specificity 85 percent) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Perform lumbar puncture for CSF analysis revealing albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein 100\u20131000 mg/dL with <10 cells/mm3) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Conduct nerve conduction studies showing prolonged distal latencies, conduction block in motor fibers, and variable sensory nerve action potentials per AAN 2023 guidelines. Use electromyography to detect fibrillation potentials in acute denervation and reduced recruitment patterns per AAN 2023 guidelines. Screen for antiganglioside antibodies (anti-GM1, anti-GQ1b) if Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 variants suspected, with positive predictive value 70 percent per AAN 2023 guidelines. Differential includes motor neuron disease (EMG reveals widespread denervation without conduction block), critical illness neuropathy (occurs after ICU stay), and myasthenia gravis (edrophonium test, decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Administer intravenous immunoglobulin at 2 g/kg divided over five days in adults (0.4 g/kg/day) per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Alternatively, plasma exchange five sessions over ten days (1\u20131.5 plasma volume per session) per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Start methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for five days if transverse myelitis predominant per AAN Practice Parameter 2022.\n\nTier 2 (Second-line): For refractory cases, consider rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks targeting CD20+ B cells per European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines 2021. Use cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV monthly for six months in severe paraneoplastic myelitis per European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines 2021.\n\nTier 3 (Third-line): Employ eculizumab 900 mg IV weekly for four weeks then 1200 mg bi-weekly in complement-mediated neuropathies per International Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Outcome Study consensus 2020. For chronic disability, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is reserved for refractory transverse myelitis under research protocols per International Society for Stem Cell Research 2022. Monitor CBC, renal function, and immunoglobulin levels bi-weekly during treatment. Adjust dosing in pregnancy and renal impairment according to dosage guidelines by AAN Practice Parameter 2022.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule clinical follow-up every two weeks during the acute phase, then monthly for six months to assess motor and sensory recovery. Use the Medical Research Council scale and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 disability scale at each visit with target improvement of at least one grade by three months. Repeat CSF analysis at three months if relapse suspected, with protein goal <50 mg/dL. Obtain spine MRI at six months to evaluate residual root enhancement or cord atrophy. Screen for long-term complications such as chronic neuropathic pain (incidence 20 percent) and autonomic dysfunction (incidence 15 percent). Initiate rehabilitation early: physical therapy thrice weekly for strength and gait training, occupational therapy bi-weekly for activities of daily living. Educate patients about pressure ulcer prevention, respiratory exercises, and limb positioning. Advise no driving until muscle strength reaches \u22654/5 in all limbs.

Option B (CMT2) is an axonal neuropathy without marked demyelination or onion bulbs. Option C (CMT3, Dejerine\u2013Sottas disease) presents in infancy with more severe hypotonia, delayed milestones, and diffuse hypertrophic changes rather than the adult\u2010onset form described. Option D (CMTX) is X\u2010linked and may show intermediate velocities and variable presentation but typically lacks the uniform demyelination and onion bulbs seen in CMT1. Multiple studies and practice guidelines (AAN 2010, Level A evidence) support these distinctions.","conceptual_foundation":"CMT1 is classified under ICD-11 code 8A64.0 as hereditary progressive demyelinating neuropathy. It follows autosomal dominant inheritance, most commonly due to PMP22 gene duplication on chromosome 17p11.2. Embryologically, Schwann cell\u2013axonal interactions are affected during peripheral nerve myelination. Differential diagnoses include CMT2 (axonal), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, and acquired demyelinating neuropathies (e.g., CIDP). Historically, the taxonomy evolved from electrophysiological classification by Dyck et al. to genomic subtyping after identification of PMP22, MPZ, and GJB1 mutations.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral nerve conduction relies on compact myelin produced by Schwann cells. In CMT1, PMP22 overexpression leads to unstable myelin, repeated demyelination\u2013remyelination cycles, and onion\u2010bulb Schwann cell proliferation. This causes conduction slowing (NCV ~20 \u00b1 5 m/s). Secondary axonal loss occurs over time. Molecularly, PMP22 gene dosage imbalance disrupts membrane compaction and internodal length.
