[{"question_number":"4","question":"Which of the following is the commonest gene in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?","options":["SOD1.","C9ORF72.","SOD2.","TDP43."],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"C9ORF72.","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: C9ORF72. A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic abnormality in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), accounting for ~40% of familial cases (Renton et al. 2011). SOD1 mutations (option A) cause ~20% of familial ALS. SOD2 (option C) is not linked to ALS. TDP-43 (option D) is pathologically aggregated in most ALS cases but is not the most frequent genetic cause.","conceptual_foundation":"ALS is a progressive motor neuron disease classified under ICD-11 8A40. Differential diagnoses include multifocal motor neuropathy and spinal muscular atrophy. Familial ALS constitutes ~10% of cases; within this group, C9ORF72 expansions are the predominant cause in European populations. The discovery of C9ORF72 in 2011 transformed genetic testing paradigms (DeJesus-Hernandez et al. 2011).","pathophysiology":"C9ORF72 repeat expansions may cause disease via RNA foci sequestration of RNA-binding proteins, dipeptide repeat protein toxicity, and haploinsufficiency of C9ORF72. This leads to motor neuron degeneration through nucleocytoplasmic transport defects, nucleolar stress, and impaired autophagy. SOD1 mutations lead to toxic gain-of-function via misfolded proteins and ER stress.","clinical_manifestation":"Familial ALS presents with combined upper and lower motor neuron signs: limb weakness, muscle atrophy, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and eventual bulbar involvement. Disease progression is rapid, with median survival 3\u20135 years. C9ORF72 expansions also predispose to frontotemporal dementia (~15%).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on revised El Escorial criteria with EMG demonstrating denervation in \u22653 regions. Genetic testing for ALS-associated genes is recommended in familial cases. C9ORF72 testing uses repeat-primed PCR. SOD1 sequencing follows if C9ORF72 is negative. MRI rules out mimics.","management_principles":"Riluzole extends survival by ~2\u20133 months (Bensimon et al. 1994). Edaravone may modestly slow functional decline in early-stage ALS (Okada et al. 2019). Supportive care includes noninvasive ventilation (prolongs survival by ~7\u20139 months) and gastrostomy for nutrition.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor respiratory function monthly (FVC, sniff nasal pressure), nutritional status, and bulbar function. Multidisciplinary clinics improve quality of life and survival. Genetic counseling is essential for family members of C9ORF72 carriers.","clinical_pearls":"1. C9ORF72 expansions cause ~40% of familial ALS. 2. SOD1 mutations are the second most common familial cause. 3. Riluzole is the only universally approved disease-modifying therapy. 4. Noninvasive ventilation significantly prolongs survival. 5. C9ORF72 carriers have increased risk of FTD.","references":"1. Renton AE, Majounie E, Waite A, et al.

Multiple cohort studies have demonstrated that up to 80\u201390% of MG patients with anti\u2013striated muscle antibodies harbor a thymoma on imaging or surgical pathology. Option A is incorrect because these antibodies do not correlate specifically with ocular\u2010only MG. Option C is incorrect\u2014steroid resistance in MG is more closely related to MuSK\u2010positive disease rather than anti\u2013striated muscle antibodies. Option D is incorrect because anti\u2013MUSK antibodies are mutually exclusive with anti\u2013AChR and anti\u2013striated muscle antibodies.","conceptual_foundation":"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder targeting the neuromuscular junction. Anti\u2013striated muscle antibodies (against titin and ryanodine receptor) arise as paraneoplastic onconeural antibodies in thymoma\u2010associated MG. Thymic pathology is central to the immunopathogenesis of AChR\u2010positive MG. Diagnosis relies on clinical fatigable weakness, serology, electrophysiology, and chest imaging.","pathophysiology":"In thymoma\u2010associated MG, neoplastic thymic epithelial cells express striational muscle antigens, leading to autoantibody generation (anti\u2010titin, anti\u2010RyR). These antibodies reflect a broader breakdown in central tolerance and are markers for thymic malignancy rather than direct mediators of neuromuscular transmission failure.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. Those with thymoma often have more severe generalized weakness. Anti\u2013striated muscle antibodies are detected more often in older patients and those with generalized MG.","diagnostic_approach":"Serologic testing includes AChR\u2010binding, AChR\u2010modulating, anti\u2010MuSK, and anti\u2013striated muscle antibodies. Chest CT or MRI is indicated when anti\u2013striated muscle antibodies are positive to evaluate for thymoma.","management_principles":"Treatment of thymomatous MG involves thymectomy plus immunotherapy (steroids, steroid\u2010sparing agents). Thymoma requires oncologic management.

In C8-T1 radiculopathy, the lesion is proximal to the dorsal root ganglion, so SNAPs remain normal. Option A (abnormal CMAP) can occur in both neuropathy and radiculopathy if motor fibers are affected. Option C (prolonged F-wave) also occurs in both. Option D (digitus minimi weakness) is a clinical sign but does not distinguish neuropathy from radiculopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"In nerve conduction studies, lesions proximal to the dorsal root ganglion (radiculopathy) preserve sensory potentials, whereas lesions distal to the ganglion (peripheral neuropathy) reduce SNAP amplitudes. Motor conduction studies and F-wave latencies are less specific.","pathophysiology":"Compression or entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow or wrist leads to demyelination/axonal loss in peripheral sensory fibers, reducing SNAP amplitude. In radiculopathy, the lesion is pre-ganglionic and spares the ganglion cell body.","clinical_manifestation":"Ulnar neuropathy presents with sensory loss in the ulnar distribution and intrinsic hand muscle weakness. Radiculopathy presents with dermatomal sensory changes and may include neck pain and paraspinal muscle spasm.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: NCS including SNAPs, CMAPs, F-waves. An abnormal SNAP localizes lesion distal to the dorsal root ganglion, confirming neuropathy.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affecting the bulbar region presents with progressive dysphagia, dysarthria, drooling, tongue atrophy and fasciculations, spastic dysarthria, and brisk jaw\u2010jerk. Option A (Progressive supranuclear palsy) is characterized by vertical gaze palsy and axial rigidity, not lower motor neuron signs. Option C (Pseudo\u2010bulbar affect) describes involuntary emotional expression, not true motor weakness or fasciculations. Option D (Progressive bulbar palsy) is an outdated term for bulbar\u2010onset ALS and is essentially synonymous with answer B, but the modern classification is bulbar\u2010onset ALS, making B the best answer.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding bulbar\u2010onset ALS requires knowledge of motor neuron classification: upper motor neurons (corticobulbar tracts) and lower motor neurons (cranial nerve nuclei). Bulbar muscles (innervated by CN V, VII, IX, X, XII) manifest combined UMN and LMN signs in ALS. In ICD\u201011, ALS is coded under G12.2. The differential includes primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, and pseudobulbar affect disorders, distinguished by absence or presence of LMN or UMN features and emotional lability.","pathophysiology":"In ALS, degeneration of motor neurons in the motor cortex, brainstem cranial nerve nuclei, and anterior horn cells leads to loss of excitatory input to muscles. Proposed mechanisms include glutamate excitotoxicity, TDP\u201043 proteinopathy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired axonal transport. Bulbar involvement arises from selective vulnerability of corticobulbar and bulbar motor neurons, leading to dysphagia and dysarthria.","clinical_manifestation":"Bulbar\u2010onset ALS patients present initially with slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and choking on liquids. Tongue atrophy and fasciculations occur in ~70% of bulbar patients. UMN signs, such as spastic dysarthria and brisk jaw reflex, appear later. Average survival after bulbar onset is 20\u201324 months, shorter than limb\u2010onset ALS.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on clinical criteria (El Escorial Revised): evidence of LMN and UMN signs in bulbar regions and progression. EMG shows denervation (fibrillations, positive sharp waves) in bulbar and limb muscles. MRI is done to exclude structural lesions.
