Supportive care, which is in fact the recommended management approach for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). No disease\u2010modifying therapy has been demonstrated to alter the natural history of IBM in randomized trials. Attempts with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents (methotrexate, azathioprine), and biologics (anti\u2010TNF, IVIG) have uniformly failed to produce sustained benefit. IBM typically shows refractory response to immunotherapies, distinguishing it from polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Since no alternative option is listed, A is correct by default.","conceptual_foundation":"Inclusion Body Myositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, characterized histologically by endomysial inflammation, rimmed vacuoles, and inclusion bodies containing \u03b2\u2010amyloid and other misfolded proteins. It falls under the category of inflammatory myopathies in ICD\u201011 (MG23.2) and is classified as a late\u2010onset, slowly progressive muscle disease with both inflammatory and degenerative features. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis, dermatomyositis, immune\u2010mediated necrotizing myopathy, and hereditary IBM. IBM pathogenesis is thought to involve autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction and protein aggregation alongside a T\u2010cell\u2013mediated immune response.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle fiber maintenance requires balanced proteostasis. In IBM, misfolded proteins including amyloid\u2010\u03b2 and TDP\u201043 accumulate within muscle fibers, forming inclusion bodies. Concomitant CD8+ cytotoxic T\u2010cells invade nonnecrotic fibers, likely via upregulated MHC\u2010I on myofibers. Lysosomal and proteasomal clearance pathways become overwhelmed, leading to muscle fiber degeneration, vacuole formation, and fibrosis. Chronic low\u2010grade inflammation fails to clear aggregates, perpetuating the cycle of degeneration.","clinical_manifestation":"IBM typically presents after age 50 with asymmetric, distal more than proximal weakness. Hallmark features include wrist and finger flexor weakness, quadriceps atrophy, and knee extensor weakness. Onset is insidious; progression is slow (10\u201320% strength loss per year), often leading to ambulation difficulty within 10\u201315 years. Dysphagia occurs in up to 40% of patients. Serum CK is usually normal to moderately elevated (<15\u00d7 ULN).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on clinical phenotype plus muscle biopsy. MRI may show selective muscle involvement. Biopsy demonstrates endomysial CD8+ T\u2010cell infiltrates, rimmed vacuoles, congophilic inclusions, and 15\u201318 nm tubulofilaments on EM. Electrodiagnostics show myopathic motor unit potentials with early recruitment. Serology for autoantibodies is usually negative. Genetic testing may exclude hereditary IBM variants.","management_principles":"No immunosuppressive or disease\u2010modifying therapies have proven efficacy in IBM. Management is supportive: physical therapy to maintain mobility, occupational therapy for ADLs, assistive devices (braces, canes), and nutritional support for dysphagia (swallow therapy, PEG when needed). Experimental therapies (bimagrumab, rapamycin) remain investigational.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular follow\u2010up every 6\u201312 months to assess strength, function, swallowing, and respiratory status. Monitor for contractures and osteoporosis from immobility. Adjust assistive devices as strength declines. Swallowing evaluation annually or if dysphagia worsens.","clinical_pearls":["IBM is distinguished from polymyositis by distal muscle involvement (finger flexors, quadriceps) and poor steroid response.","Rimmed vacuoles with congophilic material on muscle biopsy are pathognomonic for IBM.","CK elevations in IBM are typically <10\u00d7 ULN, whereas dystrophies often have much higher CK.","Dysphagia occurs in up to 40% of IBM patients\u2014screen early and consider swallow therapy.","No effective immunotherapy exists; focus on multidisciplinary supportive care."],"references":["1.

At the level of the acetabulum, an avulsion or fracture can impinge upon the sciatic nerve trunk where the peroneal (fibular) component lies laterally and is more exposed and susceptible to compression. Injury to this lateral fascicle produces foot dorsiflexion weakness and sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot. The medial fascicle contains the tibial portion, which when spared preserves plantarflexion and sole sensation. A medial aspect lesion would cause tibial deficits, and a lesion at the sciatic trunk before bifurcation would produce both peroneal and tibial deficits. There is no fourth option provided.","conceptual_foundation":"The sciatic nerve emerges from L4\u2013S3 nerve roots, travels through the greater sciatic foramen, courses posterior to the hip joint, and divides into tibial and common peroneal nerves near the popliteal fossa. Within the posterior thigh and proximal buttock, the common peroneal component lies laterally within the common epineurial sheath, making it more vulnerable to lateral compression. The differentiation of tibial versus peroneal lesions hinges on topographical anatomy. Embryologically, the sciatic nerve arises from neural crest cells that differentiate into Schwann cells and satellite cells, surrounding motor and sensory axons derived from ventral and dorsal spinal cord neurons.","pathophysiology":"Traumatic fracture fragments or hematoma can compress the lateral fascicle of the sciatic nerve against rigid pelvic structures. Ischemia and direct mechanical injury lead to Wallerian degeneration distal to the lesion. The peroneal portion degenerates, disrupting innervation of dorsiflexors (anterior tibialis, extensor hallucis longus) and sensory fibers to the dorsum of the foot and lateral leg, producing foot drop and hypoesthesia. The tibial portion remains intact, preserving plantarflexion and sole sensation. In contrast, a lesion in the sciatic trunk would affect both divisions equally, and a medial fascicle lesion is rare given protective anatomy.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely after pelvic or acetabular injury with foot drop, steppage gait, loss of dorsiflexion, and numbness to pinprick and temperature on the dorsum of the foot and lateral shin. Reflexes at the ankle (Achilles) are preserved, knee reflexes normal. There is no calf muscle or intrinsic foot muscle atrophy acutely. Over weeks, denervation potentials appear in peroneal\u2010innervated muscles on EMG. Natural history without surgical decompression may lead to persistent deficits and neuropathic pain.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier assessment includes neurovascular exam and sensory mapping. Nerve conduction studies show absent or reduced peroneal CMAP amplitudes with normal tibial responses; SNAP of the superficial peroneal nerve is reduced. EMG reveals denervation potentials in tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum brevis. MRI of the pelvis with neurogram sequences can localize compression at the acetabular region. Pre-test probability is high after acetabular fracture; NCS sensitivity for peroneal lesions ~90% (CI 85\u201395%), specificity ~92% (CI 88\u201396%).","management_principles":"Initial management includes surgical fixation of the acetabular fracture, decompression of the sciatic nerve if entrapped, and post-operative physiotherapy. Orthotic support (ankle\u2010foot orthosis) prevents foot drop deformity. Pain is managed with NSAIDs and neuropathic agents (gabapentin). Prognosis is favorable if decompression occurs within 3\u20136 months; chronic compression beyond 6 months leads to incomplete recovery in over 40% of cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurologic exam every 4\u20136 weeks post-injury. Repeat NCS/EMG at 3 months to assess reinnervation. Physical therapy with progressive resistance exercises and gait training. Monitor for muscle atrophy and contractures. Long-term follow-up includes orthotic reassessment and possible tendon transfer surgery if dorsiflexion recovery is inadequate after 9\u201312 months.","clinical_pearls":"1. In pelvic fractures, the peroneal division is lateral and more vulnerable\u2014think foot drop. 2. Preserved plantarflexion and sole sensation localize lesion to peroneal fascicle. 3. Early surgical decompression within 3 months improves outcomes. 4. Ankle\u2010foot orthosis is key to maintain gait while recovery occurs. 5. MRI neurogram can identify entrapment at the acetabular region.","references":"1.

Based on the description\u2014multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) presenting with severe weakness, absence of muscle atrophy, and conduction block on nerve conduction studies\u2014the most likely diagnosis is MMN with conduction block. MMN is an immune\u2010mediated demyelinating motor neuropathy characterized by asymmetric distal weakness without significant sensory loss or atrophy. In the absence of conduction block on initial NCS, the term \u201cprobable MMN\u201d applies if clinical features are classical. Differential diagnoses include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).","conceptual_foundation":"MMN falls under ICD-11 code 8A63.2 as an immune-mediated neuropathy. It is classified among chronic acquired demyelinating neuropathies. The pathognomonic finding is motor conduction block in non-entrapment sites, reflecting segmental demyelination. MMN typically affects men more than women (ratio ~2:1), with onset in the fourth decade. The absence of atrophy distinguishes MMN from motor neuron disease. Anti\u2013GM1 IgM antibodies are detected in ~40\u201350% of cases. Embryologically, peripheral motor fibers derive from ventral spinal motor neurons, but the demyelination is acquired.","pathophysiology":"MMN involves autoimmune attack on myelin at the nodes of Ranvier of motor axons, leading to segmental demyelination and conduction block without significant axonal degeneration. Anti\u2013GM1 IgM antibodies bind to ganglioside GM1 concentrated at nodes, activating complement and causing reversible paranodal demyelination. Preservation of axons explains minimal atrophy. Chronic low\u2010grade inflammation may eventually cause secondary axonal loss in long-standing cases. Contrast with CIDP, which affects both motor and sensory fibers and shows symmetric demyelination.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with slowly progressive, asymmetric, distal limb weakness (hand > foot) over months to years. Fasciculations and cramps are common. There is minimal or no sensory involvement and no significant muscle atrophy early. Reflexes can be preserved or mildly reduced. Natural history without treatment leads to gradually worsening weakness and secondary muscle wasting after several years.","diagnostic_approach":"Key investigations include nerve conduction studies demonstrating focal motor conduction block (drop in CMAP amplitude \u226550% between proximal and distal stimulation) in non-entrapment sites. Sensory NCS are normal. CSF protein may be mildly elevated. MRI may show nerve root enlargement. Anti\u2013GM1 IgM assays support the diagnosis. Probable MMN is diagnosed when clinical criteria are met but conduction block is absent or equivocal; sensitivity of NCS for conduction block ~80%, specificity ~95%.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days, then maintenance 1 g/kg every 2\u20134 weeks; 70\u201380% of patients respond with improved strength. Corticosteroids and plasmapheresis are ineffective or detrimental. Rituximab has been used in refractory cases with some success. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy support function.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor strength monthly during induction, then every 2\u20133 months once stable. Repeat NCS annually to detect new blocks. IVIG dosing individualized based on relapse pattern. Monitor for IVIG adverse effects (renal function, hemolysis). Consider spacing infusions when stable for \u22656 months. Assess fatigue and quality-of-life scores semiannually.","clinical_pearls":"1.
