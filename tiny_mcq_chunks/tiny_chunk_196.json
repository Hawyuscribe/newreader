This feature distinguishes them from true rosettes seen in neuroblastomas or Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes in retinoblastoma.","conceptual_foundation":"Ependymomas derive from ependymal cells lining the ventricular system and central canal. WHO grades II (classic), III (anaplastic) ependymomas and myxopapillary variants have distinct histology. Pseudorosettes occur when tumor cells cluster around vessels rather than form true luminal structures.","pathophysiology":"Genetic aberrations in RELA-fusion-positive supratentorial ependymomas and chromosomal gains in posterior fossa type A drive proliferation. Tumor cells often retain ependymal features, including perivascular pseudorosettes.","clinical_manifestation":"Presentation includes hydrocephalus in children (posterior fossa tumors) or spinal cord compression symptoms in adults (myxopapillary). Symptoms correlate with location\u2014ataxia, headache, vomiting for posterior fossa, conus-cauda syndrome for spinal lesions.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI shows an intraventricular or intraparenchymal mass, often with heterogeneous enhancement. Histology reveals perivascular pseudorosettes and EMA positivity. Molecular classification refines prognosis.","management_principles":"Surgical resection with gross total removal is primary therapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy improves progression-free survival in grade II\u2013III ependymomas. Chemotherapy has limited role except in pediatric populations.","follow_up_guidelines":"Serial MRI every 3 months in first year, then every 6 months for up to 5 years. Monitor for spinal metastases. Myxopapillary ependymomas require long-term surveillance due to late recurrences.","clinical_pearls":"1. Pseudorosettes are hallmark of ependymoma; 2. Supratentorial RELA-fusion type has poorer prognosis; 3. Myxopapillary variant arises in conus medullaris; 4. Gross total resection is critical; 5. CSF seeding necessitates craniospinal imaging.","references":["1. Louis DN et al. WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System, 5th ed. IARC; 2021.","2. Cavalli FMG et al.

Steroids decrease capillary permeability, improve intracranial compliance, and often yield rapid neurologic improvement.","conceptual_foundation":"Glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) is a highly infiltrative astrocytic tumor causing vasogenic edema due to abnormal tumor neovasculature. Edema rather than the solid tumor often contributes most to increased intracranial pressure and focal signs.","pathophysiology":"GBM disrupts the blood\u2013brain barrier through secretion of VEGF and other cytokines, leading to plasma extravasation into the interstitium. Corticosteroids stabilize endothelial tight junctions and downregulate inflammatory mediators, reducing fluid leakage.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with headaches, nausea, vomiting, focal neurologic deficits (e.g., hemiparesis), seizures, and altered mental status. The degree of edema correlates with symptom severity rather than tumor bulk alone.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with contrast confirms an irregular ring-enhancing lesion with central necrosis and surrounding edema. Perfusion imaging and spectroscopy aid differentiation from metastasis. Steroid administration before imaging may alter enhancement patterns.","management_principles":"Initial management of symptomatic edema is dexamethasone 10 mg IV bolus followed by 4 mg every 6 hours. Tapering begins once definitive treatment (surgical resection) is planned. Steroids improve neurologic function pre-operatively.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status daily. Taper steroids slowly over 1\u20132 weeks post-resection to avoid rebound edema. Surveillance MRI post-op to assess resection extent and plan adjuvant chemoradiation.","clinical_pearls":"1. Vasogenic edema drives symptoms in GBM; 2. Dexamethasone has minimal mineralocorticoid effect; 3. Steroid taper must be gradual; 4. Steroids can mask tumor enhancement on MRI; 5. Watch for steroid side effects (hyperglycemia, immunosuppression).","references":["1. Stupp R et al. Radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma.

Meningiomas are the most common benign intracranial tumors, accounting for approximately 36% of all primary brain neoplasms and 53% of benign tumors in large population\u2010based series (CBTRUS 2012\u20132016). Option B (GBM) is malignant (WHO grade IV) and represents ~14.5% of primary brain tumors. Option C (pituitary adenoma) is common but many are microadenomas (<1 cm) and often subclinical; overall incidence is lower than meningioma. Option D (schwannoma) accounts for ~8% of primary intracranial tumors. Therefore, meningioma is the single most frequent benign intracranial neoplasm.","conceptual_foundation":"Meningiomas arise from arachnoid cap cells of the leptomeninges. In ICD-11, they are coded as 2A00. Clinical subtypes include WHO grade I (benign), II (atypical), III (anaplastic). Micro- and macroadenomas of the pituitary gland are neoplastic proliferations of adenohypophyseal cells; most are benign but their frequency does not surpass meningiomas in surgical or imaging series. Schwannomas, predominantly vestibular, arise from Schwann cells; benign but less common. WHO classification of CNS tumors (2016, updated 2021) integrates histology and molecular markers, but for benign entities, genetic alterations in NF2 and TRAF7 are common in meningiomas.","pathophysiology":"Meningiomas exhibit slow growth by proliferation of arachnoid cap cells. NF2 gene on chromosome 22q deletion is common; merlin loss leads to dysregulated cell growth. Hormonal influences (progesterone receptor positivity) may drive growth in women. They compress adjacent brain tissue, causing symptoms via mass effect rather than invasion. Contrast-enhanced MRI shows dural-based enhancing lesions with dural tail. Pituitary adenomas secrete hormones causing endocrine syndromes. Schwannomas demonstrate Antoni A and B patterns histologically, with Verocay bodies.","clinical_manifestation":"Benign meningiomas commonly present in middle-aged women (F:M ~2:1), with headache, seizures (20\u201340%), focal neurologic deficits depending on location (e.g., convexity, parasagittal, falcine, sphenoid wing). Natural history: growth rate ~1\u20132 mm/year for incidental, ~3\u20134 mm/year for symptomatic. Microadenomas often present with hormone effects (e.g., prolactinoma) rather than mass effect. Vestibular schwannomas cause unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI brain with and without contrast; meningioma appears as extra-axial, dural-based, homogeneously enhancing mass with dural tail. CT shows hyperostosis of adjacent bone. Second-tier: MR spectroscopy and perfusion can differentiate atypical/anaplastic meningioma. Biopsy is diagnostic. Pituitary adenomas require dedicated sellar MRI. Schwannomas are diagnosed with internal auditory canal MRI with gadolinium.","management_principles":"Asymptomatic small meningiomas can be observed with serial MRI (6-month interval initially). Symptomatic or growing tumors are treated with surgical resection (Simpson grade I\u2013II). Adjuvant radiotherapy (fractionated or stereotactic radiosurgery) is for residual or atypical/anaplastic meningiomas. Pituitary adenomas: medical therapy (dopamine agonists for prolactinomas) or transsphenoidal surgery for mass effect. Schwannomas: stereotactic radiosurgery for small tumors; microsurgical resection for large lesions.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-resection MRI at 3 months, then annually for 5 years, then every 2\u20133 years. Monitor for recurrence especially in WHO grade II/III. Functional assessments include neurological exam and neuro-ophthalmology for skull base tumors. Endocrine panels post pituitary surgery.","clinical_pearls":"1. Meningioma is the most common benign brain tumor (~36% of primary CNS tumors). 2. Female predominance and hormonal influences suggest role for progesterone receptor. 3. Dural tail sign on MRI is characteristic but not pathognomonic. 4. Simpson grading predicts recurrence risk; Grade I has lowest (9% at 10 years). 5. NF2 mutation on chr 22 is frequent; consider genetic testing in multiple or pediatric cases.","references":"1.
