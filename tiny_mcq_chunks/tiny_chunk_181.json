The condition is characterized by confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, though the latter may be absent in a significant number of cases. Given that the patient presents with confusion and a history of increased vomiting without any ophthalmological findings, the administration of thiamine is essential. \n\nThiamine deficiency occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption, or increased demand during pregnancy. In cases of hyperemesis gravidarum, prolonged vomiting can lead to significant electrolyte imbalances and nutrient deficiencies, particularly thiamine. Administering thiamine before glucose infusion is critical to prevent the exacerbation of neurological symptoms and potential progression to Korsakoff syndrome.\n\n### Other Options (Hypothetical)\nWhile the question lists only one answer (thiamine), if there were other options, they would likely include:\n- B) Folic acid: While important for preventing neural tube defects in pregnancy, it does not address the immediate concerns of Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy.\n- C) Vitamin B12: Important for neurological health, but it does not play a direct role in treating Wernicke\u2019s.\n- D) Electrolyte replacement: While necessary in cases of vomiting and dehydration, electrolyte replacement alone will not address thiamine deficiency.\n\n## 2. Conceptual Foundation\n\nWernicke\u2019s encephalopathy is an acute neurological condition resulting from thiamine deficiency. It is part of the spectrum of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS), which includes both Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome, the latter being a chronic neurocognitive disorder. Thiamine is necessary for glucose metabolism and the synthesis of neurotransmitters. Inadequate thiamine levels can lead to significant metabolic dysfunction, particularly in the brain.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the demand for thiamine increases due to the metabolic needs of both the mother and the developing fetus. Hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, can lead to inadequate caloric intake and subsequently to nutrient deficiencies, including thiamine.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThiamine plays a vital role in several enzymatic processes, particularly those involving carbohydrate metabolism. It is a cofactor for enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, which converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, essential for the Krebs cycle. A deficiency in thiamine disrupts these metabolic pathways, leading to an accumulation of pyruvate and lactate, resulting in metabolic acidosis.\n\nIn Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, the primary lesions occur in the mammillary bodies, thalamus, and brainstem. These areas are critical for memory, coordination, and eye movement. The lack of thiamine leads to neuronal damage in these regions, causing the classic symptoms of confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. The absence of ophthalmoplegia does not negate the diagnosis, as it can be missing in 19-30% of cases, particularly in pregnant women where the clinical presentation may be atypical.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nPatients with Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy may present with a classic triad of symptoms:\n- Confusion: This can range from mild disorientation to profound confusion and altered mental status.\n- Ataxia: A disturbance in coordination and balance may be evident as the cerebellum and vestibular pathways are affected.\n- Ophthalmoplegia: This manifests as paralysis or weakness of the muscles controlling eye movements, potentially resulting in nystagmus or gaze palsies.\n\nIn the case of a pregnant woman with increased vomiting, confusion is often the first sign. The absence of ocular findings can complicate the clinical picture, but it does not exclude the diagnosis. Other symptoms may include altered consciousness, memory deficits, and changes in behavior.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnosis of Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy is primarily clinical, based on the history and presentation of symptoms. However, specific diagnostic tests can support the diagnosis:\n- Serum thiamine levels: While low levels can confirm deficiency, they may not always correlate with clinical symptoms.\n- MRI of the brain: This may show characteristic lesions in the mammillary bodies and thalamus, particularly in chronic cases.\n- Electrolyte panel: To identify any imbalances due to prolonged vomiting.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include other causes of confusion, such as metabolic encephalopathies, infections (e.g., encephalitis), and other nutritional deficiencies. A thorough history and physical examination are essential to rule out these conditions.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nManagement of Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy involves:\n- Immediate thiamine administration: High-dose intravenous thiamine (typically 500 mg IV TID for 2-3 days) should be initiated before any glucose-containing fluids to prevent exacerbation of neurological symptoms.\n- Supportive care: This includes monitoring vital signs, hydration, and electrolyte management as necessary.\n- Nutritional support: Once stabilized, the patient may require dietary counseling and supplementation to prevent recurrence.\n\nIn cases where Korsakoff syndrome develops, long-term neurocognitive rehabilitation may be necessary.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\nFollow-up care for patients diagnosed with Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy includes:\n- Monitoring neurological status: Regular assessment for improvement or deterioration of symptoms.\n- Nutritional assessment: Continuous evaluation of dietary intake and potential need for further supplementation.\n- Education on prevention: Patients should be educated about the importance of a balanced diet and the potential risks of excessive vomiting and nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy.\n\nPrognosis is good with early diagnosis and treatment; however, delayed treatment can lead to irreversible damage and long-term cognitive deficits associated with Korsakoff syndrome.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Remember the triad: Confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia are classic signs, but do not rely solely on the presence of ophthalmoplegia for diagnosis.\n- Thiamine first: Always administer thiamine before glucose in at-risk patients to prevent worsening of symptoms.\n- Consider nutritional status: In pregnant patients, consider the impact of hyperemesis gravidarum on overall nutritional status and thiamine levels.\n- Monitor for improvement: Symptoms should improve within 24-48 hours of thiamine administration if the diagnosis is correct.\n\n## 9.

Pathogenic variants impair biliary copper elimination, leading to toxic accumulation in hepatocytes, basal ganglia, cornea, and other tissues. In current nosology per ICD-11, Wilson disease is classified under congenital disorders of metabolism EC52.2. Differential diagnoses include familial parkinsonism, dystonic syndromes, and other causes of liver dysfunction such as autoimmune hepatitis and hemochromatosis.\n\nEmbryologically the hepatic copper excretion pathway originates in the foregut endoderm giving rise to hepatocytes, while corneal Kayser-Fleischer rings result from copper deposition in Descemet membrane produced by neural crest\u2013derived corneal endothelium. Neuroanatomically copper preferentially deposits in basal ganglia structures including putamen, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra leading to parkinsonism and dystonia. Neurotransmitter systems affected include dopamine depletion and GABAergic dysfunction within the basal ganglia circuits, resulting in extrapyramidal signs.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, dietary copper is absorbed in the small intestine, bound to albumin and transcuprein, delivered to the liver where ATP7B mediates incorporation into ceruloplasmin and excretion into bile. In Wilson disease ATP7B loss of function causes failure of biliary copper excretion and impaired ceruloplasmin loading. Excess free copper generates reactive oxygen species via Fenton chemistry, causing lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death in hepatocytes and neurons.\n\nOn a cellular level oxidative stress activates inflammatory cascades with upregulation of TNF alpha and interleukin 6, exacerbating tissue injury. In basal ganglia, copper deposition disrupts dopamine synthesis, storage, and release, impairing nigrostriatal pathways and leading to bradykinesia and rigidity. Secondary compensatory changes include upregulation of glutamatergic transmission and GABAergic inhibition, manifesting as dystonic posturing. Chronically, gliosis and cavitation of basal ganglia may occur. Other mechanisms include endothelial dysfunction causing small vessel compromise. Penicillamine\u2019s copper chelation restores normal redox homeostasis and halts progression by enhancing urinary copper loss, addressing the root molecular defect.","clinical_manifestation":"Wilson disease presents heterogeneously with hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric features. Hepatic involvement ranges from asymptomatic transaminitis to fulminant hepatic failure. Neurological manifestations arise in adolescence or early adulthood in approximately 40\u201360 percent of cases, with parkinsonian features including bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and dystonia. Kayser-Fleischer rings are present in over 95 percent of patients with neurological disease and in 50 percent of purely hepatic presentations (Ferenci et al Liver Int 2007).\n\nSubtypes include hepatic predominant, neurologic predominant, and mixed forms. Neurologic onset typically occurs between ages 12 and 20, with male to female ratio approximately 1.3:1. Natural history without treatment leads to progressive disability, cirrhosis, and death by the third decade. Psychiatric features such as depression, psychosis, and cognitive impairment occur in up to 20 percent. Formal diagnostic criteria by the Leipzig Score incorporate clinical signs, biochemical parameters, ocular findings, and genetic testing, with sensitivity of 94 percent and specificity of 96 percent for a score \u22654.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, liver function tests, and slit lamp exam. Ceruloplasmin levels are low (<20 mg/dL) in 85 percent of patients; sensitivity is 77 percent, specificity 90 percent. Urinary copper excretion is elevated above 100 \u00b5g/24 h (sensitivity 80 percent, specificity 98 percent). Slit lamp exam demonstrates Kayser-Fleischer rings with sensitivity of 95 percent in neurologic cases, specificity 100 percent. Pretest probability in symptomatic young patients with transaminitis and movement disorder is high (>50 percent), yielding a post-test probability >95 percent with positive rings.\n\nSecond-tier liver biopsy quantifies hepatic copper (>250 \u00b5g/g dry weight; sensitivity 96 percent, specificity 95 percent). Genetic testing for ATP7B mutations confirms the diagnosis with near-complete specificity but variable sensitivity in different ethnic groups. Specialized testing includes penicillamine challenge urinary copper measurement and brain MRI showing hyperintensities in basal ganglia. Diagnostic overlap with autoimmune hepatitis and hemochromatosis requires exclusion via autoantibodies and iron studies. Future developments include noninvasive imaging of hepatic copper via MRI T2* mapping.","management_principles":"Chelation therapy is the mainstay. Penicillamine is administered at 250 mg daily, titrated over weeks to 1,000\u20131,500 mg/day in divided doses. Peak urinary copper excretion increases by 600\u20131,000 \u00b5g/day. Adverse effects include hypersensitivity, nephrotoxicity, and bone marrow suppression; monitoring includes blood counts and urinalysis monthly for the first six months. Alternative chelator trientine dihydrochloride (750\u20131,500 mg/day) is used in penicillamine intolerance. Zinc salts (150 mg elemental zinc/day) induce metallothionein and reduce intestinal copper absorption; used for maintenance or presymptomatic therapy.\n\nSymptomatic treatments such as levodopa or anticholinergics may alleviate extrapyramidal signs but do not modify disease course. Physical and occupational therapy improve function. In fulminant hepatic failure or decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplantation is indicated, correcting metabolic defect and leading to neurological improvement in over 80 percent of adults. Special populations such as pregnant women require dose adjustments and careful monitoring. Refractory neurologic progression despite chelation may benefit from combined therapies or transplantation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow up visits should occur monthly for the first three months, then every three months once stable. Monitoring includes 24-hour urinary copper excretion, complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function. Therapeutic target urinary copper is 200\u2013500 \u00b5g/day on chelation. Slit lamp exam annually assesses ring regression. Brain MRI may be repeated every 2\u20133 years to monitor basal ganglia changes. Liver elastography evaluates fibrosis progression yearly.\n\nLong-term therapy is lifelong; abrupt cessation leads to relapse within months. Prognostic factors include early chelation initiation, degree of hepatic fibrosis, and severity of neurologic impairment at baseline. Transition of care from pediatric to adult services at age 18\u201321 should ensure continuity. Quality of life measures and mental health screening are recommended annually. Strategies for relapse prevention include patient education on medication adherence and dietary copper restriction. In transplant recipients, standard post-transplant monitoring protocols apply.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always examine for Kayser-Fleischer rings in young patients with movement disorders; their presence has 95 percent sensitivity in neurologic Wilson disease and is pathognomonic when present.\n2. Penicillamine chelation must be started slowly and titrated to avoid allergic reactions and bone marrow suppression; monitor blood counts biweekly initially.\n3. Low ceruloplasmin alone is not diagnostic; combine with 24-hour urinary copper and slit lamp findings to reach a Leipzig score \u22654 for definitive diagnosis.\n4. Symptomatic anti-parkinsonian agents do not replace chelation; use penicillamine first to prevent irreversible neurologic injury.\n5. Lifelong adherence to chelation and zinc therapy is critical; interruption often leads to rapid disease progression and hepatic decompensation.","references":"1. Roberts EA, Schilsky ML.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Astrocytoma","Ependymoma","Meningioma"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Astrocytoma","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Astrocytoma is the most likely diagnosis for an intramedullary, ill-defined, non-enhancing lesion on spinal MRI. Spinal cord astrocytomas are infiltrative gliomas that typically present as T2 hyperintense, poorly demarcated lesions that do not enhance or only minimally enhance with gadolinium (Dailey et al., 2019; Fehlings et al., 2012). In contrast, ependymomas (option B) are the most common primary intramedullary tumor in adults but usually appear as well-circumscribed lesions with strong, homogeneous enhancement and often demonstrate a characteristic \u201ccap sign\u201d of hemosiderin at the poles (Petit et al., 2015). Meningiomas (option C) are extramedullary, dural-based tumors that compress the spinal cord from outside rather than infiltrating it, and they are typically vividly enhancing. Therefore, the imaging features of an intramedullary, ill-defined, non-enhancing lesion best fit astrocytoma.","conceptual_foundation":"Spinal cord tumors are classified based on location: intramedullary (within the cord parenchyma), intradural-extramedullary, and extradural. Intramedullary tumors include astrocytomas and ependymomas. The 2021 WHO classification of CNS tumors places astrocytomas under diffuse gliomas, with grading based on histologic and molecular features (Louis et al., 2021). Astrocytomas originate from astrocytic glial cells derived embryologically from neuroepithelial progenitors in the neural tube. They are subdivided into pilocytic astrocytomas (grade I), diffuse astrocytomas (grade II), anaplastic astrocytomas (grade III), and glioblastoma (grade IV). Spinal astrocytomas are most often diffuse (grade II) or anaplastic (grade III), presenting in younger adults but spanning all ages. Differential diagnoses include demyelinating lesions (e.g., multiple sclerosis plaques), vascular malformations, and infectious or inflammatory myelopathies\u2014all of which may show variable enhancement patterns but lack the infiltrative features seen in spinal astrocytomas.","pathophysiology":"Normal spinal cord astrocytes support neuronal homeostasis, maintain the blood-brain barrier, and regulate extracellular ion homeostasis. In astrocytomas, driver mutations (e.g., IDH1/IDH2, TP53, ATRX loss) lead to uncontrolled astrocyte proliferation and infiltrative growth. The lack of a defined tumor capsule allows neoplastic cells to interdigitate with normal parenchyma, creating an ill-defined lesion on MRI. Blood-brain barrier integrity remains relatively preserved in low-grade astrocytomas, accounting for absent or minimal gadolinium enhancement. Progression to higher grade involves additional genetic hits (e.g., EGFR amplification, CDKN2A deletion) that increase angiogenesis and necrosis, often producing heterogeneous enhancement in anaplastic tumors.","clinical_manifestation":"Spinal astrocytomas present insidiously over months with progressive myelopathic signs: gait disturbance, lower extremity weakness, sensory changes (dissociated or mixed), and sphincter dysfunction. Pain is less common than with extramedullary tumors. On examination, one finds spastic paraparesis, hyperreflexia, Babinski signs, and vibratory/proprioceptive loss. The rate of progression correlates with tumor grade; low-grade tumors progress over years, whereas anaplastic astrocytomas lead to deficits over weeks to months.","diagnostic_approach":"Magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast is the gold standard. Key MRI features include T1 iso- to hypointensity, T2 hyperintensity, poor margins, and absent/minimal enhancement. Advanced sequences (diffusion tensor imaging) can map fiber tract involvement. Definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy and histopathology with immunohistochemistry (GFAP positivity). CSF analysis is typically unremarkable. Differential workup excludes inflammatory (e.g., MS), infectious, and vascular etiologies.","management_principles":"Surgical resection aiming for maximal safe removal is first-line, balancing neurological preservation against extent of resection. Complete resection is often limited by infiltrative margins. Adjuvant radiotherapy (45\u201354 Gy in conventional fractionation) is recommended for grade II lesions with residual tumor and universally for grades III\u2013IV. Chemotherapy (temozolomide) is used in high-grade gliomas per Stupp protocol. Low-grade spinal astrocytomas may be monitored if asymptomatic with small, stable lesions.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperative MRI at 3 months, then every 6 months for 2 years and annually thereafter if stable. Neurological exams every 3\u20136 months. Monitor for radiation myelopathy and late treatment effects. Adjust imaging interval based on clinical stability and tumor grade.","clinical_pearls":"1. Intramedullary, non-enhancing, ill-defined lesions strongly suggest astrocytoma. 2. Ependymomas are well-circumscribed and enhance homogeneously. 3. Meningiomas are extramedullary and dural-based. 4. GFAP immunohistochemistry confirms astrocytic lineage. 5. IDH mutation status informs prognosis and guides adjuvant therapy.","references":"1. Fehlings MG, Wilson JR, et al.
