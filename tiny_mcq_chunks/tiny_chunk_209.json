[{"question_number":"2","question":"A patient had optic neuritis in the right eye. What is the finding in the visual potential test?","options":["Right eye decrease in P100","Right eye prolonged in P100","Left eye prolonged in P100","Left eye decrease in P100"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Right eye prolonged in P100","subspecialty":"Neuroophthalmology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B (Right eye prolonged in P100). Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) measure electrical responses along the visual pathway, and the hallmark finding in demyelinating optic neuritis is a prolonged P100 latency in the affected eye. Demyelination slows conduction velocity without necessarily abolishing the response, leading to increased latency rather than amplitude loss as the primary abnormality. AAN practice parameters (2018) designate P100 latency prolongation as the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve demyelination (Level A evidence). In contrast, option A (Right eye decrease in P100) refers to amplitude reduction. Although amplitude may be diminished in severe axonal loss, it is less sensitive and less specific for demyelination than latency changes (sensitivity ~55%, specificity ~60% for amplitude vs. sensitivity ~80\u201390%, specificity ~85% for latency prolongation) [Odom et al. 2016; Petzold et al. 2018]. Option C (Left eye prolonged in P100) and option D (Left eye decrease in P100) are incorrect because the pathology is unilateral in the right eye; the fellow eye\u2019s waveforms remain within normal limits. Common misconceptions include expecting amplitude loss to be the primary marker\u2014whereas in demyelination, axonal integrity may be preserved early on, hence latency is the key parameter. Primary literature from the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (Beck et al. 1992) confirmed that P100 latency prolongation correlates with clinical visual dysfunction and recovery dynamics.","conceptual_foundation":"Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are recordings of cortical electrical activity in response to patterned visual stimuli, typically checkerboard reversals delivered at 1\u20132 Hz. The major positive component, P100, represents arrival of the volley at striate cortex along the optic nerve, chiasm, tract, lateral geniculate nucleus, optic radiations, and visual cortex. Normal P100 latencies range from 90 to 110 ms. Optic neuritis is an acute demyelinating inflammation of the optic nerve, often an inaugural manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS; ICD-11 8A40). Differential diagnoses include ischemic optic neuropathy, compressive lesions, and hereditary optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Historically, before imaging, VEPs provided objective evidence of subclinical involvement; with the advent of MRI, VEPs remain a sensitive, noninvasive functional assay. Embryologically, the optic nerve derives from the diencephalic optic stalk, with myelination by oligodendrocytes commencing around 32 weeks\u2019 gestation. The optic nerve\u2019s vascular supply is through the central retinal artery and pial vessels. Neurotransmission along the pathway involves glutamatergic synapses in the lateral geniculate nucleus and cortical projections. MOG and AQP4 antibody\u2013mediated disorders further refine the taxonomy of demyelinating optic neuropathies. With improved understanding of neuroimmunology, optic neuritis classification has evolved from idiopathic versus MS-associated to include antibody-defined entities, reflecting a modern nosology in neurology.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, saltatory conduction along myelinated axons ensures rapid transmission with minimal dispersion. In optic neuritis, an autoreactive T-cell\u2013mediated inflammatory cascade targets myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein within optic nerve oligodendrocytes. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier, recruit macrophages, and initiate demyelination. Loss of myelin increases membrane capacitance and reduces membrane resistance, slowing conduction velocity and causing temporal dispersion of the action potential. Redistribution of sodium channels along denuded axolemma partially compensates but cannot fully restore conduction speed, manifesting as prolonged P100 latency on VEP. Chronic or severe inflammation may induce axonal transection, reducing amplitude. Secondary mechanisms include mitochondrial dysfunction and ionic imbalance leading to calcium-mediated axonal injury. Over weeks, remyelination by Schwann cells or surviving oligodendrocytes can shorten conduction latency, correlating with clinical recovery. In contrast, ischemic optic neuropathy primarily causes axonal infarction and amplitude loss without proportional latency changes.","clinical_manifestation":"Optic neuritis typically presents in women aged 20\u201340 with acute unilateral visual loss evolving over hours to days, often accompanied by periocular pain exacerbated by eye movement (70\u201390% of cases). Visual acuity ranges from 20/20 to no light perception, with central scotoma in 60\u201380%. Dyschromatopsia (red desaturation) is found in >90%. Relative afferent pupillary defect is present when unilateral. Funduscopic appearance is normal (\u201cretrobulbar neuritis\u201d) in two-thirds of cases; the remainder exhibit optic disc edema. Recovery begins within 2\u20133 weeks, with most patients regaining 20/40 or better by 6 months. Subtypes include typical MS-associated optic neuritis and atypical forms (neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, MOG-IgG\u2013associated) which present with bilateral involvement, more severe visual loss, poor recovery, and longitudinally extensive optic nerve lesions on MRI. Pediatric optic neuritis more often bilateral with disc swelling. Geriatric presentations are rarer and may portend other etiologies. Untreated MS-associated optic neuritis has a 15% risk of fellow-eye involvement and a 50% 15-year risk of MS diagnosis (Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial). Formal diagnostic criteria incorporate clinical features, MRI evidence of demyelination, and supportive VEP findings.","diagnostic_approach":"The evaluation begins with history and exam (visual acuity, color vision, pupillary responses, funduscopy). First-tier tests: MRI of brain and orbits with gadolinium to detect optic nerve enhancement (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%) and white matter lesions meeting McDonald criteria (2017 revision). VEP is a second-tier functional test: pattern reversal VEP latency >115 ms in adults is abnormal (sensitivity ~80\u201390%, specificity ~85%). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness; acute swelling may confound early measurements but chronic thinning correlates with axonal loss. CSF analysis (oligoclonal bands, IgG index) supports MS diagnosis (detects oligoclonal bands in ~85% of MS patients). Blood tests exclude mimics (e.g., NMO-IgG, MOG-IgG, B12 deficiency, Lyme serology). Diffusion-weighted imaging can exclude acute ischemia. Evoked potential protocols follow ISCEV standards (2016) to ensure reproducibility. In resource-limited settings, clinical diagnosis with VEP augmentation can suffice. Electrophysiological findings may predate MRI lesions by months.","management_principles":"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days accelerates visual recovery (hazard ratio for faster improvement 1.6; 95% CI 1.2\u20132.1) but does not affect long-term visual outcome (Beck et al. 1992, NEJM). An oral prednisone taper alone is not recommended due to increased recurrence risk (odds ratio 1.9; 95% CI 1.2\u20133.0). For severe or bilateral cases (e.g., NMO-IgG positive), plasma exchange (5\u20137 exchanges over 10\u201314 days) improves outcomes (45% achieving \u22653 lines improvement vs. 22% controls; p<0.01). Disease-modifying therapies (interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate) reduce conversion to clinically definite MS when initiated within 30 days of optic neuritis (relative risk reduction 0.37; 95% CI 0.22\u20130.62). MOG-IgG\u2013associated optic neuritis may respond differently to steroids and require longer taper. Non-pharmacological: visual rehabilitation and low-vision aids in residual deficits. Special populations: pediatric dosing of IVMP is weight-based (30 mg/kg/day up to 1 g), and careful bone health monitoring is needed in chronic therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months include assessment of visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and OCT RNFL thickness. MRI brain at 3\u20136 months evaluates new demyelinating lesions. Laboratory monitoring of corticosteroid side effects (blood glucose, bone density) is indicated if extended therapy is used. Ongoing evaluation for MS conversion includes clinical exam and MRI annually for at least 5 years. Relapse prevention strategies incorporate risk stratification: presence of \u22652 T2 lesions on initial MRI predicts 78% 5-year conversion risk vs. 25% with no lesions. Transition of care from acute neurology to neuro-ophthalmology and MS specialist is recommended by AAN guidelines (2018). Function scales (Low Vision Quality of Life Questionnaire) at 6 months gauge rehabilitation needs. For NMO-IgG positive patients, annual monitoring for new optic nerve or spinal cord events is advised.","clinical_pearls":"1.

The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) demonstrated that approximately 92% of patients with MS-related optic neuritis experience periocular pain exacerbated by eye movement (Beck et al., 1992). This pain results from inflammation of the optic nerve sheath, where extraocular muscle contractions mechanically irritate the inflamed nerve. Option A (Papillitis with papilledema) is less common in MS-related optic neuritis, which more often presents as retrobulbar neuritis with a normal-appearing optic disc in up to two-thirds of cases (Hickman et al., 2004). Option B (Bilateral optic neuritis) is atypical for MS and suggests alternative etiologies such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) or infectious causes; true bilateral simultaneous optic neuritis occurs in <5% of MS cases (Wingerchuk et al., 2015).","conceptual_foundation":"Optic neuritis is an inflammatory demyelinating condition of the optic nerve often heralding MS. In ICD-11, it falls under 8A40 (demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system). Differential diagnoses include NMOSD (characterized by AQP4-IgG), MOG-IgG-associated disease, ischemic optic neuropathy, sarcoidosis, and infectious agents such as Bartonella henselae. Embryologically, the optic nerve derives from the diencephalon and is myelinated by oligodendrocytes, making it susceptible to MS pathology. The vascular supply from the posterior ciliary arteries and the blood\u2013brain barrier properties impact lesion distribution. Historically, optic neuritis was identified clinically until MRI allowed in vivo visualization of optic nerve enhancement, refining classification and prognostication. Contemporary nosology distinguishes typical demyelinating optic neuritis (unilateral, painful, retrobulbar) from atypical forms, guiding workup and management.","pathophysiology":"Normal optic nerve conduction relies on intact myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes. In MS, autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes breach the blood\u2013brain barrier, targeting myelin antigens such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and proteolipid protein (PLP). Proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) activate microglia and promote complement deposition, leading to focal demyelination, axonal transection, and Wallerian degeneration. Disruption of saltatory conduction causes vision loss. The perineural inflammation sensitizes nociceptors in the optic nerve sheath; eye movements further stretch the inflamed sheath, causing pain. Remyelination may occur via oligodendrocyte progenitor recruitment, but recurrent inflammation and glial scarring limit functional recovery.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with subacute unilateral vision loss evolving over hours to days. Periocular pain, especially with eye movement, occurs in >90% of cases and often precedes visual decline. Visual acuity can range from 20/20 to light perception; central scotomas are most common. Color vision loss (dyschromatopsia) is frequent. In retrobulbar neuritis (\u224867%), the optic disc appears normal; mild disc swelling occurs in papillitis (\u224833%). Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) is present in unilateral cases. Recovery typically begins within 2\u20134 weeks, with most improvement by 6 months. Bilateral simultaneous involvement, severe optic disc edema, hemorrhages, or lack of pain suggest atypical etiologies.","diagnostic_approach":"A structured approach begins with history and ophthalmologic exam (visual acuity, color plates, pupillary reflexes, visual fields). First-tier tests include MRI of the brain and orbits with gadolinium, which shows optic nerve enhancement in >90% (sensitivity 95%, specificity 85%) and white matter lesions fulfilling McDonald criteria. Visual evoked potentials (VEP) demonstrate delayed P100 latency (sensitivity 80%, specificity 70%). Serum testing for AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG is indicated if atypical features or bilateral involvement. Lumbar puncture for oligoclonal bands (present in ~85% of MS) and elevated IgG index (sensitivity 80%, specificity 95%) refines diagnosis. Pretest probability of MS after a first optic neuritis episode is ~30%; MRI findings increase post-test probability to >60%.","management_principles":"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3\u20135 days) followed by an oral taper accelerates visual recovery (ONTT: median recovery 3 weeks vs. 5 weeks for placebo; p<0.01) but does not improve long-term visual outcome. Oral prednisone alone (1 mg/kg) increases recurrence risk (hazard ratio 1.4; 95% CI 1.1\u20131.8) and is not recommended. In patients with MRI lesions, initiating disease-modifying therapies (interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate) reduces 2-year risk of clinically definite MS by ~50% (Level A evidence, 2017 McDonald criteria). NMOSD-associated optic neuritis requires immunosuppression (rituximab, eculizumab) rather than standard MS therapies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 6 months should assess visual acuity, visual fields, and color vision. Repeat MRI at 6\u201312 months evaluates new demyelinating lesions per 2017 McDonald criteria. Long-term follow-up includes periodic neurological exams and MRI surveillance every 1\u20132 years in treated MS to monitor disease activity. Patient education on red-flag symptoms (new neurologic deficits) and lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation, vitamin D optimization) is essential. Rehabilitation services (low-vision aids, occupational therapy) support functional recovery in cases of persistent deficits.","clinical_pearls":"1. Periocular pain with eye movement occurs in >90% of typical MS optic neuritis and helps distinguish it from ischemic and infiltrative optic neuropathies. 2. A normal-appearing optic disc (retrobulbar neuritis) is seen in ~67% of cases; disc swelling suggests alternative diagnoses if severe. 3. MRI brain lesions at presentation predict a 50% risk of MS conversion within 15 years; absence reduces risk to ~15%. 4. High-dose IV steroids speed visual recovery but do not affect long-term acuity; oral prednisone alone is contraindicated. 5. Bilateral simultaneous optic neuritis or lack of pain should prompt evaluation for NMOSD (AQP4-IgG) and MOG-IgG.","references":"1. Beck RW, Cleary PA, Backlund JC, et al.

Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, reduces cerebrospinal fluid production and is first-line therapy (Level A recommendation, Friedman et al. 2017). Randomized trials have shown significant reduction in CSF pressure and improvement in visual fields (mean decrease in opening pressure of 10\u201315 cm H2O, p<0.001) and papilledema grade (odds ratio 3.2 for papilledema improvement at six months). Option B (Prednisolone) is incorrect as corticosteroids are reserved for brief use in fulminant cases; long-term steroids increase risk of weight gain and rebound ICP elevation. Option C (Topiramate) has carbonic anhydrase\u2013inhibiting properties and can be used adjunctively, but data are limited to small open-label studies showing modest headache improvement; it is not first-line for papilledema or CSF pressure reduction.","conceptual_foundation":"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) fits within ICD-11 under 'Cerebrospinal fluid pressure abnormalities' and DSM-5-TR under somatic symptom-related disorders when headache predominates. Differential includes cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, space-occupying lesions, and medication-induced IIH (e.g., vitamin A excess). Historically termed pseudotumor cerebri, modern nosology distinguishes primary (idiopathic) versus secondary causes. Obesity (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930) is the strongest modifiable risk factor, particularly in women of childbearing age. Neuroanatomically, CSF is produced by choroid plexus and resorbed via arachnoid granulations; in IIH, resorption is impaired. Affected structures include optic nerves (papilledema) and transverse venous sinuses (venous outflow pressure elevation). Genetic predisposition involves MTHFR polymorphisms and associations with thrombophilias.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology maintains CSF production (~500 mL/day) and absorption in balance. In IIH, decreased CSF absorption at arachnoid granulations\u2014possibly from increased venous sinus pressure or impaired glymphatic clearance\u2014leads to elevated ICP. Carbonic anhydrase isoform II in choroid plexus epithelial cells catalyzes bicarbonate formation; its inhibition by acetazolamide reduces CSF secretion by 50\u201360%. Elevated ICP transmits along optic nerve sheaths, causing papilledema. Compensatory mechanisms include decreased CSF production and increased lymphatic drainage, which may be overwhelmed in obesity-related cytokine milieu. Molecular studies suggest upregulation of aquaporin-4 channels and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) in meninges, perpetuating impaired absorption.","clinical_manifestation":"IIH commonly presents with daily diffuse headache (75\u201390%), transient visual obscurations (68%), pulsatile tinnitus (58%), and diplopia from abducens nerve palsy (12\u201315%).

Risk is highest in females aged 20\u201344 with BMI\u2009>\u200930. Fulminant IIH (<4 weeks of symptoms) can rapidly progress to vision loss.

In occasional clinical scenarios where a small occlusion spares the capsular branches, one might see visual field defects only, yet anterior choroidal lesions typically yield more motor deficits in 70\u201380% of patients. Thus, option A is incorrect.  \nOption B: Posterior choroidal artery ischemia is rare and supplies medial thalamic structures including the pulvinar rather than primary optic radiations. Thalamic infarcts from this vessel produce sensory neglect or thalamic pain syndromes in approximately 30% of cases, not isolated homonymous quadrantanopia. Confusion can arise because the term \"choroidal\" overlaps with hippocampal and thalamic structures, but pure visual field defects are not characteristic.  \nOption C: The ophthalmic artery supplies the retina and optic nerve head; occlusion classically yields monocular vision loss rather than a homonymous hemianopic defect. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) presents with sudden, painless unilateral vision loss and a cherry red spot in 75\u201385% of acute presentations. Patients do not exhibit contralateral homonymous defects, so option C is excluded.  \nOption D: The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) supplies the occipital lobe including the primary visual cortex and the splenium of the corpus callosum. Infarction of the calcarine branch produces contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing in over 65% of cases due to collateral flow from the middle cerebral artery. Neuroimaging series report PCA strokes as the cause in 40\u201360% of homonymous hemianopias. This precise vascular territory correlates with the defect shown in picture B, making option D definitively correct. Common misconceptions arise from confusing retinal versus cortical lesions and under-appreciating macular sparing statistics.","conceptual_foundation":"The posterior cerebral artery arises from the distal basilar artery at the brainstem-posterior fossa junction. It courses around the midbrain, giving off thalamoperforating and thalamogeniculate branches before reaching the temporal and occipital lobes. Its calcarine branch specifically supplies the primary visual cortex in the banks of the calcarine sulcus. Embryologically, the PCA develops from the distal internal carotid system via the posterior communicating artery at around five weeks gestation, later connecting to the basilar system by eight weeks. Normal function of this region includes primary processing of visual stimuli, orientation to spatial contrast, and integration of binocular fields. Lesions produce homonymous field defects that respect the vertical meridian, unlike optic tract lesions which often have associated pupillary and afferent defects. Historically, early 20th-century anatomists such as Dejerine and Wernicke first mapped visual cortex ischemia correlating field cuts with arterial territories. Key anatomical landmarks include the calcarine sulcus, lingual gyrus, and cuneus, which correspond topographically to inferior and superior quadrants of the visual field. Clinical significance emerges when infarcts spare the macula owing to collateral flow in roughly two-thirds of PCA strokes, an important diagnostic clue that distinguishes cortical from retinal events.","pathophysiology":"Occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery leads to ischemia in cortical neurons supplied by the calcarine branch. Hypoxia triggers glutamate release and overactivation of NMDA and AMPA receptors, causing calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, and production of reactive oxygen species. Intracellular calcium overload activates caspases and calpains, initiating apoptotic and necrotic pathways within 2\u20134 hours of onset. Genetic polymorphisms in APOE and MTHFR can modulate susceptibility to ischemic injury. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 are upregulated within 6\u201312 hours, attracting neutrophils and microglial activation, which release matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the extracellular matrix. Energy failure due to decreased ATP synthesis impairs Na-K-ATPase, leading to cytotoxic edema and cell swelling. Penumbral regions enter reversible dysfunction, but without reperfusion within six hours, infarction becomes complete. Collateral circulation through leptomeningeal anastomoses from the middle cerebral artery offers partial compensation but is often insufficient if blood flow drops below 20 mL/100 g/min. Secondary excitotoxicity spreads injury to adjacent cortical areas over 24\u201348 hours, limiting neuronal recovery.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms onset is typically sudden, peaking within minutes to one hour. Patients report contralateral visual field loss described as a \"dark curtain\" in 85% of cases. Neurological examination reveals a homonymous hemianopia respecting the vertical meridian, often with macular sparing; visual acuity remains intact for central vision in two-thirds of patients. In adults, associated features include alexia without agraphia if the dominant hemisphere is involved, occurring in 15\u201320% of PCA strokes. Elderly patients may present with confusion or delirium, while pediatric cases may exhibit more pronounced seizures due to immature cortical networks. Gender differences are minimal, although some series report slightly higher incidence of visual neglect in right hemisphere infarcts in women. Associated systemic signs can include contralateral sensory loss if thalamogeniculate branches are affected. Severity is graded by the NIH Stroke Scale; visual field defects contribute two points. Without treatment, natural history includes partial spontaneous recovery in about 30% over six months, but persistent deficits occur in most patients.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial assessment follows the acute stroke algorithm: non-contrast CT within 25 minutes of arrival has sensitivity of 40\u201360% for early ischemia and specificity above 95% for hemorrhage exclusion. If CT is negative, CTA evaluates vessel patency; PCA occlusion is identified in 70\u201380% of cases. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging within three hours shows restricted diffusion in the occipital lobe with sensitivity >90% and specificity >95%. MR perfusion can delineate penumbra, guiding reperfusion therapy up to six hours post-onset. Visual field testing with confrontation examination and automated perimetry quantifies the quadrant affected. Laboratory workup includes CBC, coagulation panel (INR 0.8\u20131.2), lipid profile, glucose, and inflammatory markers. Cardiac evaluation with EKG and echocardiography rules out embolic sources. CSF analysis is not routinely indicated unless vasculitis or infection is suspected; normal opening pressure and cell counts exclude inflammatory causes. Visual evoked potentials may show delayed P100 latency on the contralateral side. Differential diagnoses include optic tract lesions, migraine with scotoma, and occipital lobe tumors. Distinguishing features include acute onset, associated cortical signs, and imaging correlates.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for acute PCA infarction is intravenous alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg), with 10% given as a bolus over one minute and the remainder infused over 60 minutes, within 4.5 hours of onset. Endovascular thrombectomy is considered for proximal occlusions up to six hours post-onset, with success rates of reperfusion (TICI \u22652b) in 70\u201380%. Blood pressure is maintained at 140\u2013180/90 mmHg before reperfusion, then <140/90 mmHg afterward. Antiplatelet agents include aspirin 160 mg daily starting 24 hours after thrombolysis and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for secondary prevention. Statin therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg daily reduces recurrence by 35% at one year. In patients with atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation with warfarin (INR target 2.0\u20133.0) or direct oral anticoagulants reduces embolic risk by 60%. Physical and occupational therapy should begin within 48 hours to promote neuroplasticity. Surgical decompression is rare but indicated if large occipital edema causes uncal herniation. Monitoring includes NIH Stroke Scale every 2 hours for first 24 hours and daily neurochecks. Special populations: in renal impairment, alteplase dose adjustment is not needed; in pregnancy, benefits must be weighed against bleeding risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Outpatient follow-up at two weeks post-discharge includes visual field testing, blood pressure monitoring, and medication adherence checks. Subsequent visits at three months and six months assess neurological recovery and secondary prevention targets: LDL <70 mg/dL, HbA1c <7%. Imaging surveillance with carotid duplex or MR angiography is performed at six months if dissection or atherosclerosis was identified. Long-term complications such as persistent visual field cut occur in up to 60% of survivors, with 20% developing depression. Prognosis: 80% survive one year, 65% survive five years post-stroke. Rehabilitation with vision restoration therapy begins by month one and continues for up to one year. Patient education covers stroke recognition (FAST), adherence to aspirin, statins, antihypertensives, and lifestyle modifications. Return to driving is typically deferred until visual fields improve, often 3\u20136 months. Referral to stroke support groups such as the American Stroke Association enhances coping and adherence.","clinical_pearls":"1.
