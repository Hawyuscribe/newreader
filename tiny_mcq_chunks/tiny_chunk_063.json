Alexia without agraphia (pure alexia) results from an infarct in the dominant occipital lobe involving the splenium of the corpus callosum, which is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). PCA strokes characteristically produce contralateral homonymous hemianopia and, in the dominant hemisphere, disconnection of visual information from the language centers, leading to preserved writing ability but inability to read. Option A (ACA) infarcts predominantly affect the medial frontal and paracentral lobule, causing leg weakness and abulia without alexia. Option B (MCA) infarcts affect lateral frontal, temporal, and parietal regions causing aphasia or hemineglect but spare the splenium and visual cortex in most cases. Option D (Basilar artery) strokes produce brainstem syndromes, consciousness changes, and oculomotor deficits, not isolated alexia without agraphia with hemianopia.","conceptual_foundation":"Alexia without agraphia is a classic disconnection syndrome in which visual word form information from the nondominant visual cortex cannot reach the dominant angular gyrus due to splenial damage. The PCA supplies the occipital pole (visual cortex) and splenium. In ICD-11, this would be classified under ischaemic stroke of the PCA territory. Differential diagnoses include dominant MCA stroke with visual cortex involvement (but MCA spares the splenium), left angular gyrus lesions (which cause aphasia in addition to alexia), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) which is reversible and bilateral.","pathophysiology":"Normal reading requires intact visual cortices and transfer of information via the splenium to language areas in the dominant hemisphere. PCA infarction in the dominant hemisphere damages the left occipital lobe causing right homonymous hemianopia and interrupts callosal fibers in the splenium, preventing visual information from reaching Wernicke\u2019s and angular gyrus despite preserved motor pathways for writing. Cellular ischemia leads to energy failure, glutamate excitotoxicity, cytotoxic edema, and infarction of neurons and axons in the PCA territory.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with sudden-onset right homonymous hemianopia and inability to read words or letters, despite preserved ability to write and intact oral language. Writing is normal, spelling aloud is intact, and other cognitive functions may be preserved. Pure alexia accounts for <1% of stroke syndromes and is most common in middle-aged to older adults. On exam, confrontation visual fields demonstrate hemianopia, reading tests fail, writing tasks succeed, and naming or repetition are intact.","diagnostic_approach":"Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is the gold standard to detect acute PCA infarcts. CT angiography can localize PCA occlusion. Visual field testing quantifies hemianopia. Neuropsychometric reading and writing assessments confirm dissociation. First-tier tests: noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, MRI-DWI for infarct. Second-tier: MR angiography for vessel occlusion. Third-tier: neuropsychometric evaluation for alexia subtyping.","management_principles":"Management follows acute ischemic stroke guidelines. If within 4.5 hours, administer IV alteplase per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level A). For PCA occlusion with significant deficits within 6\u201324 hours, consider endovascular thrombectomy if accessible. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days then aspirin alone) and management of risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Rehabilitation includes reading therapy with compensatory strategies.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up MRI at 24\u201348 hours to confirm infarct evolution. Visual field assessments at 1 month and 3 months. Outpatient stroke clinic visits every 3 months for risk factor control. Neuropsychology referral for reading rehabilitation and occupational therapy for visual compensation. Long-term antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy indefinitely.","clinical_pearls":"1. Pure alexia results from dominant PCA splenial infarction\u2014visual information cannot cross to language centers. 2. Hemianopia with preserved writing is pathognomonic for alexia without agraphia. 3. PCA strokes often present with visual symptoms first. 4. Acute management follows general ischemic stroke protocols (tPA, thrombectomy). 5. Reading rehabilitation employs letter-by-letter reading strategies.","references":"1.

What is the next step in management?","options":["MRI","CTA","Conventional angiography"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"CTA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. CTA. After identification of an acute intracerebral hemorrhage on noncontrast CT, CT angiography (CTA) is the recommended next step to rapidly evaluate for underlying vascular lesions\u2014such as aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), dural arteriovenous fistulae, or mycotic aneurysms\u2014that may have precipitated or contributed to the hemorrhage. The 2015 AHA/ASA Guidelines for the Management of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage (Class I, Level B) specifically recommend CTA in lobar hemorrhages and in younger patients without clear hypertensive history to exclude treatable vascular anomalies. In meta-analysis data (Delgado Almandoz et al., AJNR 2010), CTA demonstrated a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 100% for detecting aneurysms in the setting of ICH, and the \u201cspot sign\u201d on CTA predicts hematoma expansion with pooled sensitivity ~73% and specificity ~88% (Woo et al., Stroke 2013).\n\nOption A (MRI) is not ideal acutely due to longer acquisition times, less sensitivity for hyperacute blood on standard sequences, and limited availability in unstable patients. MRI sequences (GRE, SWI) can detect microbleeds and cavernomas but are adjunctive rather than first\u2010line in acute ICH workup (AHA/ASA 2015, Class IIb, Level C).\n\nOption C (conventional angiography) remains the gold standard for detailed vascular mapping but is invasive, time\u2010consuming, carries a 0.5\u20131% risk of stroke, and generally follows a negative or non\u2010diagnostic CTA when clinical suspicion remains high (AHA/ASA 2015, Class IIa, Level B). CTA thus serves as the rapid, noninvasive gatekeeper before catheter angiography.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) refers to bleeding into the brain parenchyma and accounts for 10\u201315% of all strokes. ICH is subclassified by location (lobar, deep, brainstem, cerebellar) and by etiology (hypertensive arteriopathy, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformations, hemorrhagic conversion of infarcts, neoplasms, coagulopathy). In ICD-11, ICH is coded under BA41. Lobar hemorrhages in older adults often reflect cerebral amyloid angiopathy or AVMs; deep (basal ganglia, thalamic) hemorrhages typically result from chronic hypertension. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic tumor. Historically, the focus was on supportive care; with advances in vascular imaging the paradigm shifted toward early identification of treatable vascular lesions. Embryologically, cerebral vessels develop from neural crest\u2013derived angioblasts; maldevelopment can lead to AVMs or aneurysms. Neuroanatomically, lobar corticosubcortical bleeds implicate middle cerebral artery branches, whereas deep bleeds involve lenticulostriate arteries. Molecular predispositions include apolipoprotein E \u03b52/\u03b54 alleles in cerebral amyloid angiopathy\u2013related ICH and SMAD4/ENG mutations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Understanding these classifications and etiologies underpins the indication for vascular imaging such as CTA in the acute setting.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral vessels maintain blood\u2013brain barrier integrity via endothelial tight junctions, basement membrane, and astrocytic endfeet. Chronic hypertension leads to lipohyalinosis and Charcot\u2010Bouchard microaneurysm formation in small penetrating arterioles, predisposing to deep ICH. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy involves \u03b2\u2010amyloid deposition in vessel walls, causing fragility and lobar hemorrhages. Vascular malformations such as AVMs consist of a tangle of malformed vessels lacking normal capillary beds, resulting in high\u2010flow shunts that erode vessel walls under hemodynamic stress.\n\nIn acute ICH, vessel rupture leads to extravasation of blood into the parenchyma, mechanical tissue disruption, and a cascade of secondary injury: hemoglobin breakdown releases iron and free radicals, inducing oxidative stress; thrombin and other blood products activate inflammatory cascades, leading to perihematomal edema; and mass effect raises intracranial pressure, reducing cerebral perfusion. The spot sign on CTA represents active contrast extravasation, correlating with ongoing bleeding and hematoma expansion. Comparing CTA and conventional angiography: CTA visualizes active extravasation and vascular architecture noninvasively, whereas digital subtraction angiography provides higher spatial resolution at the cost of procedural risk.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with ICH typically present with sudden-onset focal neurological deficits corresponding to the hemorrhage location\u2014e.g., contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss in lobar or basal ganglia bleeds, dysarthria and ataxia in cerebellar bleeds, or decreased consciousness in large or brainstem hemorrhages. Headache occurs in approximately 40\u201360%, nausea/vomiting in up to 30%, and seizures in 10\u201316% of cases. Lobar hemorrhages often present with cortical signs such as aphasia or visual field deficits; deep hemorrhages more commonly yield pure motor or sensory syndromes. The natural history in untreated lobar ICH includes risk of hematoma expansion (20\u201330% within the first 24 hours), early neurologic deterioration, and high 30-day mortality (30\u201340%). Early vascular imaging is critical to identify treatable causes (e.g., AVM obliteration, aneurysm coiling). Clinical criteria for CTA include lobar location, age < 60 without hypertension, or unexplained ICH on initial CT. In the elderly with deep hypertensive hemorrhage and typical radiographic features, vascular imaging may be deferred but remains advisable.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Noncontrast head CT is the initial study for suspected ICH (AHA/ASA 2015, Class I, Level A). Upon identification of ICH, assess hematoma volume, location, intraventricular extension, and midline shift. Second-tier: CTA of head and neck is recommended to evaluate for vascular lesions in lobar ICH, atypical presentations, or ICH in patients <55 years (Class I, Level B). CTA sensitivity ~97%, specificity ~100% for aneurysms (Delgado Almandoz et al., 2010). Pre-test probability of a vascular lesion in lobar ICH without hypertension is ~30\u201340%; a positive CTA increases post-test probability to >90%. Third-tier: Digital subtraction angiography if CTA is negative but clinical suspicion remains high (deep seated AVM, mycotic aneurysm, dural fistula). Angiography carries a 0.5\u20131% procedural stroke risk. In resource-limited settings, CTA remains more accessible than angiography. MRI/MRA may be adjunctive for cavernoma detection but are not first-line acutely. FAST inclusion of CTA in the acute stroke protocols reduces time to diagnosis of vascular anomalies and enables early neurosurgical planning.","management_principles":"Medical management of ICH focuses on blood pressure control, intracranial pressure management, reversal of coagulopathy, and supportive care. The INTERACT2 trial demonstrated that intensive BP lowering (systolic target <140 mmHg) is safe and may improve outcomes (NEJM 2013, OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75\u20131.01). Platelet transfusion and reversal agents are indicated for antithrombotic-associated ICH (Guidelines Class I, Level A). Neurosurgical intervention (e.g., hematoma evacuation, external ventricular drain) depends on location, size (>30 mL lobar, >10 mL cerebellar), and clinical deterioration (Class IIa, Level B).\n\nVascular-targeted treatments follow CTA/angiography findings: aneurysm clipping/coiling, AVM embolization/surgical resection, or radiosurgery. Timely CTA informs neurosurgical planning and patient counseling. Intraventricular hemorrhage may benefit from intraventricular fibrinolytics under trial protocols (CLEAR III, NEJM 2017). Rehabilitation should begin early to optimize functional recovery.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute stabilization and CTA, repeat noncontrast CT at 24 hours assesses hematoma stability. If CTA-negative and ICH etiology remains unknown, follow-up MRI with MRA/MRV in 4\u20136 weeks is recommended to detect cavernomas or small dural fistulae. Blood pressure monitoring continues inpatient with targets <140 mmHg systolic, transitioning to outpatient antihypertensive therapy. For patients with identified vascular lesions, scheduled angiographic follow-up or surveillance MRI varies by lesion type (e.g., repeat angiography 6\u201312 weeks post-embolization of AVM). Long-term ICH survivors require secondary prevention: strict BP control, statins as indicated, and lifestyle modification. Transition-of-care from hospital to rehabilitation and primary care must include education on hemorrhage warning signs and medication adherence.","clinical_pearls":"1. Spot sign on CTA predicts hematoma expansion and poor outcome; look for it in all lobar ICH cases. Mnemonic: SPOT (Spot Predicts Ongoing Thrombosis expansion).  2. Young patient with lobar ICH and no hypertension always merits CTA to exclude AVM or aneurysm\u2014even if CT appears benign.  3. Negative CTA does not rule out small dural fistulae or cavernomas; plan MRI/MRA after acute phase.  4. Intensive BP lowering (<140 mmHg) in ICH is safe (INTERACT2 trial) but monitor for renal hypoperfusion.  5. Intraventricular hemorrhage extension increases mortality; consider external ventricular drain and intraventricular thrombolysis under trial protocols.","references":"1.

What is the most likely cause?","options":["Artery to artery","Cryptogenic","Cardioembolic","Hypoperfusion"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Artery to artery","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Artery to artery. In the context of a recent motor vehicle accident, the most likely mechanism of a posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarction is an artery-to-artery embolism arising from a traumatic cervical artery dissection. According to the TOAST classification (Adams et al. 1993), large-artery atherosclerosis and arterial injury leading to artery-to-artery thromboembolism account for approximately 15\u201320% of ischemic strokes. Debette and Leys (2009) report that trauma-associated dissections are identified in up to 2% of all ischemic strokes but represent the predominant cause of PCA territory infarctions in younger patients following head/neck injury. CTA has a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90% for dissections, while digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard with near-100% sensitivity and specificity (Klisch et al. 2002). The CADISS trial (Markus et al. 2015) further underscores the role of artery-to-artery thromboembolism by demonstrating that anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategies yield similar recurrence rates when dissection is the source (annual recurrence ~2.3%).\n\nOption B, Cryptogenic, is less likely because a thorough vascular imaging workup in the trauma setting will reveal the dissection in >90% of cases; cryptogenic strokes are only classified after exhaustive negative evaluations (Sacco et al. 2013). Option C, Cardioembolic, is unlikely in the absence of preexisting atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, or intracardiac thrombus; moreover, cardioembolic strokes often produce multifocal infarcts rather than an isolated PCA lesion, and echocardiography sensitivity for left atrial appendage thrombus ranges from 50% (TTE) to 92% (TEE) (Kidwell & Warach 2003). Option D, Hypoperfusion, typically causes watershed infarctions between major arterial territories, not discrete branch occlusions such as an isolated PCA infarct (Fisher 1977). Therefore, artery-to-artery embolism from a traumatic dissection is the highest-yield diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this question requires familiarity with ischemic stroke classification, cervical arterial anatomy, and the pathophysiology of traumatic dissections. The TOAST system (Adams et al. 1993) categorizes ischemic strokes into large-artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small-vessel occlusion, other determined etiology, and cryptogenic. Cervical artery dissections fall under \u201cother determined etiology\u201d when trauma is the cause and produce artery-to-artery emboli that may travel distally to intracranial branches.\n\nFrom a nosological standpoint, ICD-11 classifies ischemic stroke under 8B20.0 with subcategories 8B20.01 (large artery) and 8B20.03 (other specified). In the DSM-5-TR, stroke sequelae are described in neurocognitive disorders due to cerebrovascular disease. Embryologically, the vertebral arteries arise from longitudinal anastomoses of cervical intersegmental arteries, with failure of regression leading to variant anatomy that influences dissection susceptibility. The PCA originates from the basilar artery tip, supplying the occipital lobes, inferomedial temporal lobes, thalamus, and midbrain. The thalamogeniculate branches supply the pulvinar and medial/inferior geniculate nuclei, structures critical for visual processing.\n\nMolecularly, dissection involves an intimal tear exposing subendothelial collagen, triggering platelet adhesion via glycoprotein Ib/V/IX and activation of the coagulation cascade. Genetic predispositions (e.g., COL3A1 mutations in Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome type IV, MTHFR polymorphisms) increase vessel wall fragility. Connective tissue disorders and hypertension are risk factors. The intimal flap and intramural hematoma narrow the lumen, creating turbulent flow that promotes thrombus formation and distal embolization. A clear understanding of these foundational concepts is essential to recognize why trauma leads to artery-to-artery embolic PCA infarction rather than other mechanisms.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral perfusion relies on intact vessel integrity and unobstructed flow through the vertebrobasilar and carotid arterial systems. In traumatic cervical artery dissection, blunt force causes an intimal tear and blood enters the vessel wall, creating an intramural hematoma. This hematoma compresses the true lumen, reducing antegrade flow locally and promoting blood stasis. The injured intima also exposes subendothelial collagen and tissue factor, activating platelet aggregation and the coagulation cascade. Thrombus forms at the site of injury and can embolize distally in an artery-to-artery fashion.\n\nIn the case of PCA territory strokes, an arterial thrombus propagates from the vertebral or basilar artery into one of the P1 or P2 segments of the PCA. Emboli lodge in these branches, causing focal ischemia in their respective vascular territories. The acute interruption of blood flow leads to failure of ATP-dependent ion pumps, loss of ionic gradients, cytotoxic edema, and excitotoxic neuronal injury via glutamate release and calcium influx. Within minutes, the ischemic penumbra develops around the core infarct, where tissue is salvageable if reperfused early. Inadequate perfusion and persistent occlusion result in infarction, inflammation, and ultimately gliosis.\n\nBy contrast, hypoperfusion infarcts occur in watershed zones where systemic hypotension reduces perfusion below the autoregulatory threshold; these infarcts are wedge-shaped and located at the borders of major arterial territories. Cardioembolic strokes originate from intracardiac thrombi and typically present with sudden, often multi-territorial infarcts. Cryptogenic strokes lack identifiable sources even after exhaustive workup. Thus, the unique combination of trauma, intimal injury, and thrombus formation culminating in artery-to-artery embolism is the hallmark mechanism in this scenario.","clinical_manifestation":"Posterior cerebral artery infarction often presents acutely with visual disturbances such as contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing (present in ~70% of PCA infarcts), visual agnosia, color dyslexia, and cortical blindness if bilateral involvement occurs. Patients may also exhibit memory impairment due to hippocampal involvement (20\u201330%), thalamic pain syndromes if thalamogeniculate branches are affected, and Alexia without agraphia in dominant hemisphere PCA infarcts (~10%). Midbrain involvement can produce oculomotor deficits or Weber\u2019s syndrome.\n\nIn traumatic artery-to-artery embolic PCA strokes, onset is usually within hours to days of the precipitating injury. Prodromal signs of cervical dissection may include ipsilateral neck pain or headache in 50\u201360% of cases. Focal neurological deficits appear suddenly and correspond to the PCA territory. A minority of patients may experience transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) with visual phenomena preceding infarction. The natural history without treatment includes risk of extension of the dissection and recurrent embolic events, with up to 30% early recurrence in untreated patients. Diagnosis relies on correlating the clinical syndrome of PCA territory dysfunction with a history of trauma and supporting imaging findings.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation of suspected traumatic cervical artery dissection with PCA infarction begins with noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage and assess for early ischemic changes. Simultaneous CT angiography of the head and neck is recommended (AHA/ASA 2018; Class I, Level A) to visualize vessel lumen irregularities, string sign, and intramural hematoma. MRI with T1-weighted fat-saturated sequences provides high sensitivity (up to 95%) for intramural hematoma. Digital subtraction angiography remains the reference standard in ambiguous cases or when endovascular intervention is considered.\n\nFirst-tier investigations include ECG monitoring for atrial fibrillation, transthoracic echocardiography to exclude cardiac sources, and basic laboratory studies. Second-tier investigations encompass transesophageal echocardiography if TTE is nondiagnostic, prolonged cardiac monitoring (up to 30 days) for occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypercoagulable workup in younger patients without other risk factors. Vessel wall imaging (MRI/MRA) clarifies dissection extent. Pre-test probability is high when trauma history, neck pain, and ipsilateral focal deficits coexist; CTA post-test probability of dissection increases from ~20% to >80% with positive findings. NNT for CTA in trauma patients is estimated at 12 to detect one clinically significant dissection.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines. In the hyperacute window (<4.5 hours), IV alteplase is indicated if no contraindications (Class I, Level A). Mechanical thrombectomy is considered for large-vessel occlusion in the basilar or P1 segments (up to 6\u201324 hours window, Class I, Level A). Specific to dissection, antithrombotic therapy aims to prevent recurrent artery-to-artery embolism. The CADISS trial demonstrated no significant difference in recurrent stroke between anticoagulation (heparin bridging to warfarin, INR 2\u20133) and antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75\u2013100 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily) over 3 months, with recurrence rates of ~2.3% (Class IIa, Level B).\n\nBlood pressure is managed to maintain cerebral perfusion (target systolic 140\u2013160 mmHg). Analgesics for neck pain, and neurosurgical consultation if pseudoaneurysm or expanding hematoma is present. Risk factor modification (smoking cessation, lipid lowering with high-intensity statin therapy) follows secondary prevention recommendations. Rehabilitation services address visual field deficits and gait or balance issues if cerebellar or brainstem involvement occurred.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up imaging with CTA or MRA at 3\u20136 months is recommended to document vessel healing; complete vessel recanalization occurs in 60\u201380% of dissections. Clinical follow-up includes neurological examination at 1, 3, and 6 months to monitor for recurrent events or delayed complications (e.g., pseudoaneurysm formation). Antithrombotic therapy duration is typically 3\u20136 months, guided by imaging evidence of healing; persistent stenosis or pseudoaneurysm may warrant extended therapy or endovascular intervention.\n\nLong-term management focuses on modifiable risk factors: blood pressure control (<130/80 mmHg), LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dL, and lifestyle interventions.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["Giant cell arteritis","Retinal artery branch occlusion","Posterior non-arteritic optic neuropathy ## Page 2"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Giant cell arteritis","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Giant cell arteritis. Evidence-based guidelines (American College of Rheumatology 1990) identify new-onset headache in patients over 50, elevated ESR (>50\u2009mm/hr), anemia of chronic disease, and visual field defects such as sectoranopia from ischemic optic neuropathy as cardinal features of GCA (Hunder et al. Arthritis Rheum. 1990). A meta-analysis (Kermani et al. Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2012) demonstrated that an ESR >50\u2009mm/hr has a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 87% for GCA, and visual symptoms occur in 15\u201320% of cases. Option B (retinal artery branch occlusion) can cause sectoranopia but lacks systemic manifestations (headache, anemia) and elevated ESR; fluorescein angiography distinguishes it but is not associated with constitutional symptoms (Hayreh. Prog Retin Eye Res. 2005). Option C (posterior non-arteritic optic neuropathy) typically presents with sudden monocular vision loss, normal inflammatory markers, and no headache; Humphrey perimetry shows central scotoma rather than quadrant defects (Hayreh & Zimmerman. Ophthalmology. 2008). Common misconceptions include attributing any visual field defect with headache to migraine or non-arteritic causes without checking ESR/CRP. High-quality evidence (Level A) from ACR guidelines supports the diagnosis of GCA in this scenario.","conceptual_foundation":"Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a granulomatous vasculitis of medium- and large-sized arteries, predominantly affecting branches of the external carotid artery. In the ICD-11, GCA is classified under vasculitis (LA01.2), and in DSM-5-TR it is not a psychiatric classification but is recognized in the context of somatic symptomatology. Historically first described by Hutchinson in 1890, the taxonomic understanding evolved when Horton et al. in 1932 identified the temporal artery involvement. GCA lies within the spectrum of large-vessel vasculitides, related to Takayasu arteritis but affecting older patients. Embryologically, the external carotid arterial branches derive from the third aortic arch; inflammation targets the adventitia and media, sparing the intima until secondary hyperplasia. Neuroanatomically, the ophthalmic artery branches\u2014the posterior ciliary arteries\u2014supply the optic nerve head; occlusion leads to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy manifesting as sectoranopia. The internal elastic lamina fragmentation and giant cell infiltration are mediated by Th1/Th17 cells producing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6 (Gilden et al. Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2020). Blood supply compromise leads to cranial ischemic symptoms, while systemic IL-6\u2013driven acute-phase responses cause elevated ESR and anemia. This pathogenetic framework bridges molecular immunology to clinical presentation.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, medium- and large-sized arteries exhibit a three-layer structure\u2014intima, media, adventitia\u2014with the internal elastic lamina maintaining vessel integrity. In GCA, a cell-mediated immune response triggers infiltration of dendritic cells in the adventitia, presentation of vascular antigens, and recruitment of CD4+ Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes. These secrete interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-6, driving macrophage activation and formation of multinucleated giant cells. Matrix metalloproteinases degrade the elastic lamina, while intimal hyperplasia narrows the lumen. The resulting ischemia affects end organs\u2014the optic nerve head supplied by short posterior ciliary arteries\u2014producing sectoral infarction (sectoranopia). Systemically, IL-6 induces hepatocyte synthesis of fibrinogen and CRP, manifesting as elevated ESR. Chronic inflammation leads to anemia of chronic disease via hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration. In contrast, non-arteritic optic neuropathy lacks inflammatory infiltrates and is linked to vascular risk factors. Retinal artery branch occlusion involves embolic or thrombotic blockage without granulomatous inflammation. The temporal progression in GCA can be acute (visual loss within hours to days) or subacute (headache over weeks), with compensatory collateral formation insufficient to prevent ischemia.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with GCA classically present after age 50 (mean age 75), with new-onset, severe temporal headache in over 80% of cases, scalp tenderness (scalp hypersensitivity in 60%), jaw claudication (40%), and constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss). Visual symptoms such as transient visual obscurations occur in 20\u201330%, and permanent visual loss in 15\u201320%. Sectoranopia results from partial infarction of the optic nerve head. Laboratory findings include ESR >50\u2009mm/hr (sensitivity 84%, specificity 87%), CRP elevation in >90%, and normocytic normochromic anemia in 60%. ACR classification requires \u22653 of 5 criteria: age \u226550, new headache, temporal artery abnormality, elevated ESR, positive temporal artery biopsy. Untreated, up to 50% risk of contralateral blindness within days. Variants include large-vessel GCA affecting the aorta and branches, causing limb claudication and aneurysm formation, more common in Caucasians. In immunocompromised patients, presentation may be muted. In geriatric populations, comorbidities can obscure symptoms; careful screening is critical.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes urgent ESR and CRP (grade A recommendation, ACR 2016). A normal ESR/CRP does not exclude GCA but with low pretest probability can reduce need for biopsy (post-test probability falls below 5%). Temporal artery ultrasound (halo sign) has sensitivity 75% and specificity 90% (NNT=4 for high-risk cohort). When ultrasound is unavailable, high-resolution MRI or PET-CT can detect vessel inflammation. Temporal artery biopsy remains gold standard (sensitivity 70\u201390%, specificity nearly 100%), ideally within 2 weeks of corticosteroid initiation; skip lesions necessitate \u22652 cm specimen. Pretest probability assessment (GCAPS score) guides use of imaging vs. biopsy. Second-tier\u2014advanced imaging to evaluate aortic involvement. Third-tier\u2014biomarkers under investigation (serum IL-6 levels). In resource-limited settings, clinical criteria plus elevated ESR/CRP justify empiric treatment. False negatives occur with prior steroid use; overlapping features with polymyalgia rheumatica require careful differentiation.","management_principles":"Immediate high-dose glucocorticoids (prednisone 40\u201360 mg/day) are indicated upon suspicion to prevent irreversible vision loss (ACR guidelines 2016, Class I, Level A). Intravenous methylprednisolone 500\u20131000 mg/day for 3 days is reserved for acute visual symptoms. Tapering begins after 2\u20134 weeks, monitoring ESR/CRP; average duration 1\u20132 years. Tocilizumab (anti\u2013IL-6 receptor) demonstrated in GiACTA trial (Stone et al. N Engl J Med. 2017) to achieve sustained remission with reduced cumulative steroid dose (HR for relapse 0.41, 95% CI 0.27\u20130.65). Methotrexate is a second-line steroid-sparing agent (meta-analysis hazard ratio for relapse 0.65). Aspirin 75\u2013100 mg/day may reduce ischemic complications (observational studies). Bone protection with calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates is mandatory. In refractory cases, consider azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. Pregnancy management balances maternal risk; steroids are Category C but accepted.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 2\u20134 weeks during induction, then every 3 months during taper. Monitor ESR and CRP at each visit; rising values prompt relapse evaluation. DEXA scan at baseline and annually for osteoporosis assessment. Imaging follow-up (ultrasound or PET-CT) at 6\u201312 months to detect large-vessel involvement. Functional assessment using GCA Activity Score (GCAS) guides therapy adjustment. Long-term surveillance for aortic aneurysm with CT angiography at 1, 5, and 10 years. Quality-of-life tools (SF-36) assess corticosteroid impact. Relapse risk factors include high initial ESR, jaw claudication, and female sex. Tapering must be slow to avoid rebound. Transition to primary care once stable on low-dose prednisone (<5 mg/day) with rheumatology oversight.","clinical_pearls":"1. Jaw claudication is the single most specific symptom for GCA (specificity 91%); presence strongly warrants urgent therapy. 2. \u2018Halo sign\u2019 on temporal artery ultrasound has high specificity (90%) and can obviate biopsy in experienced hands. 3. Tocilizumab reduces relapse risk by 59% (GiACTA trial) and is steroid-sparing; consider early in high-risk patients. 4. Always obtain temporal artery biopsy within 2 weeks of steroids; skip lesions necessitate long specimens (\u22652 cm). 5. Low-dose aspirin (75\u2013100 mg/day) may reduce visual and cerebrovascular ischemic events; discuss risk\u2013benefit in each patient.","references":"1. Hunder GG, et al.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["ICA stenosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"ICA stenosis","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Unilateral deep watershed infarctions on MRI FLAIR are a classic radiologic signature of hemodynamic compromise due to proximal carotid artery disease. The internal carotid artery (ICA) supplies both the superficial and deep perforating branches; when ICA stenosis reaches a critical threshold (typically \u226570% luminal narrowing), perfusion pressure distal to the stenosis falls below the autoregulatory capacity of cerebral arterioles. This leads to ischemia in the junctional (\u201cwatershed\u201d) zones between major vascular territories\u2014most prominently in the deep border\u2010zone between the lenticulostriate and medullary end\u2010arteries. No alternative diagnosis is offered among the choices. Therefore, the correct answer is A: ICA stenosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Watershed infarcts arise in two main distributions: cortical (between anterior cerebral artery\u2013middle cerebral artery [ACA\u2013MCA] and MCA\u2013posterior cerebral artery [MCA\u2013PCA] territories) and deep or internal (between the penetrating lenticulostriate and medullary arteries). ICA stenosis leads to decreased perfusion pressure, especially affecting distal arterioles that lack collateral anastomoses. In the current World Health Organization ICD\u201011 classification, watershed infarctions fall under ischaemic stroke subtypes (8A63.0). Differential diagnoses include cardioembolic infarcts (often territorial or scattered), small vessel (lacunar) infarcts (\u226415 mm, in deep gray or white matter), and cortical embolic infarcts. Historically, the concept of watershed infarction was first described in the early 20th century, with angiographic correlations established in the 1970s. The deep border\u2010zone corresponds anatomically to the periventricular and centrum semiovale regions supplied by terminal branches of the MCA and ACA and penultimate branches of the anterior choroidal and lateral lenticulostriate arteries.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is maintained via autoregulation across a range of mean arterial pressures (\u224860\u2013150 mm Hg). In high\u2010grade ICA stenosis, CPP distal to the stenosis falls, prompting arteriolar vasodilation to preserve flow. When maximal vasodilation is reached, any further drop in CPP leads to ischemia. This hemodynamic failure preferentially injures watershed zones where collateral flow is weakest. Cellularly, hypoperfusion triggers energy failure, loss of ionic gradients, glutamate excitotoxicity, reactive oxygen species generation, and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Over hours, cytotoxic edema ensues in vulnerable deep white matter. By contrast, embolic infarcts produce sudden vessel occlusion with more abrupt onset, territorial infarcts, and cortical involvement. In watershed infarcts from ICA stenosis, the gradual flow limitation may produce stepwise clinical deficits or border\u2010zone phenomena (e.g., \u201cman-in\u2010a\u2010barrel\u201d syndrome for bilateral ACA\u2013MCA border\u2010zone infarcts).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with deep watershed infarcts due to ICA stenosis often present with fluctuating focal deficits reflecting the affected perforator territories: contralateral pure motor or sensorimotor signs, dysarthria, or ataxia. Symptoms can be insidious, worsening during hypotension (e.g., during dialysis or cardiac surgery). In unilateral deep watershed infarction, one may observe contralateral facial weakness, mild hemiparesis, and gait disturbance without cortical signs such as aphasia or visual field cuts. Natural history without intervention includes risk of recurrent stroke, progression to large territorial infarction, and cognitive decline when bilateral. Formal diagnosis relies on the 2019 AHA/ASA criteria for ischaemic stroke subtyping, which include radiologic confirmation of watershed distribution, absence of a clear cardiac or small\u2010vessel source, and imaging or ultrasound evidence of ipsilateral high\u2010grade ICA stenosis.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, followed by MRI with DWI and FLAIR to identify watershed infarcts. Carotid duplex ultrasonography is the initial screening for ICA stenosis (sensitivity ~94%, specificity ~92%). Second-tier: CT angiography or MR angiography to quantify stenosis and plaque characteristics; identified \u226570% ICA stenosis indicates high risk. Third-tier: Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard for luminal assessment (sensitivity and specificity >98%). Advanced perfusion imaging (CT or MRI perfusion) can assess cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT), with reduced CBF and prolonged MTT in border\u2010zone regions confirming hemodynamic compromise. Pretest probability of significant stenosis in symptomatic patients is ~30\u201340%; post-test probability with duplex ultrasound positive \u226590%.","management_principles":"AHA/ASA guidelines (2019) recommend antiplatelet therapy\u2014aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily (Class I, Level A)\u2014and high\u2010intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg daily) for all atherosclerotic stroke patients. For symptomatic ICA stenosis of 70\u201399%, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) within 2 weeks of index event reduces recurrent stroke risk (NNT=6 over 2 years; Class I, Level A). For 50\u201369% stenosis, CEA is reasonable in selected men <75 years (Class IIa, Level B). Carotid artery stenting is an alternative in high\u2010risk surgical candidates (Class IIb, Level B). Strict blood pressure and glycemic control, smoking cessation, and lifestyle modification are essential adjuncts.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post\u2010CEA, duplex ultrasound surveillance is recommended at 1 month, 6 months, and annually thereafter (Class IIa, Level C). Ongoing clinical follow\u2010up every 3\u20136 months during the first year, then annually. Continue antiplatelet therapy indefinitely; monitor lipids every 3\u20136 months until targets met (LDL <70 mg/dL). Blood pressure should be maintained <140/90 mm Hg (<130/80 mm Hg in diabetes). Rehabilitation services for residual deficits, cognitive assessment in elderly patients, and evaluation for contralateral disease as indicated.","clinical_pearls":"1. Deep vs. cortical watershed infarcts distinguish hemodynamic from embolic etiologies; deep lesions point to proximal ICA flow limitation. 2. Duplex ultrasound is an excellent first\u2010line tool for ICA stenosis screening; confirm \u226570% stenosis with CTA/MRA. 3. Early carotid endarterectomy (<2 weeks) in symptomatic high\u2010grade stenosis yields maximal benefit\u2014delay increases perioperative risk. 4. Hypotensive episodes (e.g., during dialysis) can precipitate watershed infarcts in patients with high-grade ICA stenosis. 5. In unilateral watershed infarction, evaluate for contralateral compensation and bilateral disease; bilateral deep lesions may herald watershed dementia over time.","references":"1.
