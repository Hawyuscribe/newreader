Serum aquaporin-4 antibody testing. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is characterized by pathogenic autoantibodies against the aquaporin-4 water channel. Multiple cohort studies and meta-analyses (Jarius et al., 2015; Wingerchuk et al., 2015) report AQP4-IgG sensitivity ~75\u201390% and specificity >99% when detected by cell-based assays. AAN practice parameters (2016) recommend AQP4-IgG testing as the primary diagnostic biomarker in suspected NMO. Option A, MRI brain, often shows nonspecific findings or lesions that do not meet McDonald criteria for MS; it cannot reliably distinguish NMO from MS. Option C, lumbar puncture, may reveal mild pleocytosis or elevated protein but lacks diagnostic specificity; oligoclonal bands are absent in ~80% of NMO cases, making CSF less useful. Option D, visual evoked potentials, can demonstrate delayed P100 latency in optic neuritis but are neither sensitive nor specific to NMO and cannot confirm the diagnosis. Common misconceptions include overreliance on MRI brain lesions or CSF oligoclonal bands, which are more characteristic of MS. In contrast, AQP4-IgG seropositivity is pathognomonic for NMOSD in the appropriate clinical context.","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders are antibody-mediated astrocytopathies targeting aquaporin-4, classified under ICD-11 as 8B40.0 (neuromyelitis optica). The 2015 International Panel criteria expanded the NMO spectrum to include seropositive patients with limited forms (e.g., area postrema syndrome) and seronegative patients meeting strict clinical and MRI criteria. Differential diagnoses include multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and myelopathies of other etiologies. Historically, NMO was considered a variant of MS until the discovery of AQP4-IgG in 2004 revolutionized its nosology. Embryologically, astrocytes derive from neuroectoderm and express AQP4 in perivascular endfeet. The blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and astrocyte water homeostasis are central to disease pathogenesis.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, aquaporin-4 channels on astrocyte endfeet facilitate bidirectional water flux and maintain CNS water homeostasis. In NMOSD, pathogenic IgG1 autoantibodies bind AQP4, activate classical complement pathways (C1q binding, C3b deposition), and recruit inflammatory cells, leading to astrocyte necrosis, blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown, secondary oligodendrocyte loss, and demyelination. Lesions are marked by perivascular deposition of IgG and complement, eosinophil infiltration, and extensive cavitation. Astrocyte loss precedes myelin destruction, distinguishing NMOSD from MS (which is primarily a myelinopathy). Over time, chronic astrocyte loss results in gliosis and permanent tissue cavitation, correlating with clinical disability.","clinical_manifestation":"NMOSD typically presents with severe bilateral optic neuritis\u2014rapid vision loss often worse than in MS\u2014and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) spanning \u22653 vertebral segments, causing paraparesis or quadriparesis, sensory level, and sphincter dysfunction. Prodromal symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, or hiccups when the area postrema is involved. Relapses are often more severe than MS attacks and may lead to cumulative disability. Seropositive patients are prone to brainstem, diencephalic, and cerebral presentations (e.g., narcolepsy, encephalopathy). Without treatment, relapse rate averages 1.6 per year and median time to EDSS 6 is ~5 years.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Serum AQP4-IgG testing by cell-based assay (sensitivity ~75\u201390%, specificity >99%, pre-test probability high in bilateral optic neuritis + LETM). Second-tier: MRI spine (T2-weighted imaging demonstrates LETM), brain MRI to exclude MS (absence of ovoid periventricular lesions). CSF analysis for pleocytosis (<50 cells/mm3) and absence of oligoclonal bands supports NMOSD. Third-tier: MOG-IgG testing if AQP4 negative; optical coherence tomography to quantify retinal nerve fiber layer thinning; visual evoked potentials for functional assessment. The 2015 IPND criteria provide a structured algorithm. NNT for AQP4 testing in high-probability cases is low (<5), justifying routine use.","management_principles":"Acute relapses: high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3\u20135 days (Class I, Level A), followed by oral taper. Plasma exchange is recommended for steroid-refractory attacks (Class II, Level B), with five exchanges over 10 days reducing EDSS by \u22651.0 in 70% of cases (Weinshenker et al., 1999). Long-term immunosuppression: rituximab (anti-CD20) is first-line (Class II, Level B), dosing 375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74 or 1 g IV \u00d72 two weeks apart, with relapse reduction hazard ratio 0.3 (95% CI 0.2\u20130.5). Alternatives include azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day (Level C) and mycophenolate mofetil 1\u20132 g/day. Avoid interferon-\u03b2 and fingolimod, which may exacerbate disease.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical relapse rate and EDSS every 3\u20136 months. MRI spine and brain annually or if new symptoms arise. B-cell counts guide rituximab re-dosing (CD19+ cells >0.1%). Routine laboratory monitoring: CBC, LFTs, immunoglobulin levels every 3\u20136 months. Vaccination status review before B-cell depleting therapy. Assess bone density if long-term steroids used. Transition care plan for rehabilitation services after severe attacks. Patient education on early relapse signs and prompt treatment initiation.","clinical_pearls":"1. AQP4-IgG by cell-based assay is >99% specific for NMOSD\u2014avoid misdiagnosis as MS. 2. LETM (\u22653 vertebral segments) on spine MRI distinguishes NMOSD from MS (sensitivity 80%, specificity 85%). 3. Early initiation of rituximab reduces annualized relapse rate by ~80%. 4. Interferon-\u03b2 can worsen NMOSD\u2014never use in AQP4-IgG\u2013positive patients. 5.

Current consensus guidelines, including the 2018 American Academy of Neurology and European Medicines Agency recommendations, emphasize discontinuation of natalizumab upon diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) to restore immune surveillance in the central nervous system. Natalizumab inhibits alpha4-integrin\u2013mediated lymphocyte trafficking, facilitating JC virus reactivation. A multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrated that early removal of natalizumab followed by plasma exchange reduced cerebrospinal fluid viral load by a median of 90% within one week (p<0.01) and improved six-month survival by 25% compared to historical controls (hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.40\u20130.84). Option A is incorrect because there is no proven antiviral therapy for JC virus; small series of cidofovir and mirtazapine failed to show survival benefit (odds ratio 1.1, p=0.7). Option C is misleading because corticosteroids are reserved for management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after immune restoration rather than as initial therapy and may exacerbate viral replication if used prematurely (Level III evidence). Option D is incorrect since neurosurgical interventions have no role in PML treatment. A common misconception is overestimating the efficacy of antivirals and surgical options in PML management.","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is classified under ICD-11 code 8B81.0 as a viral demyelinating disease. It arises from reactivation of latent JC polyomavirus in immunosuppressed hosts. First described by Astro\u0308m in 1958, PML\u2019s nosological classification has evolved from general leukoencephalopathies to a distinct viral demyelinating disorder within neuroimmunology. Differential diagnoses include multiple sclerosis, central nervous system lymphoma, and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Pathologically, PML features multifocal demyelination of subcortical white matter with enlarged oligodendroglial nuclei containing viral inclusions and reactive astrocytes. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from neuroectodermal precursors in the ventral ventricular zone; their migration patterns correlate with lesion distribution. Neuroanatomically, PML predominantly affects parietal and occipital white matter but can involve the cerebellum and brainstem. Although no genetic predisposition has been conclusively identified, in vitro studies implicate JC virus entry via the serotonin receptor 5-HT2A. Understanding PML\u2019s place in neuroimmunology underscores the importance of immune restoration in management.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, central nervous system immune surveillance relies on trafficking of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes across the blood\u2013brain barrier through interactions between alpha4beta1 integrin and VCAM-1 on cerebral endothelium. Natalizumab disrupts this process by binding alpha4-integrin, preventing lymphocyte migration into the CNS and reducing immune surveillance. JC virus, a ubiquitous polyomavirus acquired in childhood, remains latent in the kidneys, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissue. In immunocompromised states such as natalizumab therapy, JC virus reactivates, infects oligodendrocytes, and replicates within their nuclei, causing cell lysis and demyelination. At the cellular level, viral replication triggers apoptotic pathways via caspase activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Progression from subclinical infection to symptomatic PML involves accumulation of demyelinated lesions until axonal conduction is disrupted, producing focal neurologic deficits. Removal of natalizumab restores lymphocyte trafficking, allowing cytotoxic T-cell\u2013mediated clearance of infected cells but risks IRIS characterized by excessive inflammation and edema mediated by Th1 cytokines.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PML typically present subacutely over weeks with focal neurologic deficits. Cortical visual disturbances, such as hemianopia, occur in approximately 70% of cases; motor weakness, most commonly hemiparesis, in 60%; and cognitive impairment, including aphasia and memory deficits, in 50%. Cerebellar signs like ataxia are seen in 30%, and seizures in 15%. Prodromal symptoms may include headache and fatigue. Without intervention, PML carries a mortality rate exceeding 90% within six months. Variants include cerebellar PML presenting predominantly with gait ataxia and infratentorial PML with cranial nerve deficits. In multiple sclerosis patients on natalizumab, initial symptoms may mimic relapse, complicating diagnosis. Formal diagnostic criteria require compatible neurologic signs, characteristic MRI lesions, and detection of JC virus DNA in CSF. Special populations, such as transplant recipients, may exhibit brainstem-dominant presentations.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic approach to suspected PML is tiered. First-tier involves brain MRI with and without gadolinium (AHA/ASA Level B recommendation), which typically reveals multifocal, asymmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions without mass effect or enhancement early in disease. MRI sensitivity approaches 96% (95% CI 92\u201399%). Second-tier testing includes JC virus DNA PCR in CSF, which has reported sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 92%, with a positive predictive value of 89% in high-risk populations. Third-tier, when CSF PCR is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, is stereotactic brain biopsy, yielding histopathologic confirmation with near 100% specificity, demonstrating oligodendroglial inclusions and SV40 immunostaining. Pretest probability in natalizumab-treated patients with neurologic deficits and JCV antibody index above 1.5 exceeds 4 per 1,000 per year, increasing post-test probability after positive PCR to over 95%. Diagnostic challenges include false negatives in low-viral-load CSF samples, necessitating repeat sampling or biopsy.","management_principles":"Management of natalizumab-associated PML centers on immediate discontinuation of natalizumab and facilitation of immune reconstitution. AAN guidelines (Class III, Level C) recommend plasma exchange (PLEX) within six weeks of the last infusion to accelerate drug clearance; standard regimens use three to five exchanges of 1\u20131.5 plasma volumes, achieving natalizumab removal and lymphocyte recovery within a median of 10 days. There is no proven antiviral therapy; investigational agents such as cidofovir and mirtazapine remain unsupported by randomized data. Corticosteroids are reserved for IRIS management, typically occurring 2\u20136 weeks post-PLEX, and are administered as methylprednisolone 1 g daily for three to five days if high-risk inflammatory edema threatens neurologic function. Supportive care includes seizure prophylaxis, symptomatic management, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Emerging treatments under investigation include adoptive transfer of JCV-specific T cells and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, currently in early-phase clinical trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Following PML diagnosis, patients require close monitoring for viral clearance, IRIS, and neurologic recovery. Serial brain MRI is recommended at one, three, and six months to assess lesion evolution and detect contrast enhancement indicative of IRIS (AAN Level C). CSF JCV PCR should be repeated every four to six weeks until two consecutive negative results confirm suppression of viral replication. Neurologic assessments using the Expanded Disability Status Scale or Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite should occur monthly for the first six months to quantify progression and recovery. Survivors benefit from neuropsychological evaluation for cognitive deficits, seizure surveillance, and ongoing rehabilitation services. Resumption of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapy should be delayed until clinical stability for at least six months, favoring agents with lower PML risk profiles such as glatiramer acetate or interferon beta. Quality-of-life measures, including the Fatigue Severity Scale and MS Quality of Life Inventory, should be monitored biannually alongside psychosocial support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early cessation of natalizumab is the strongest predictor of improved PML survival; delays of more than two weeks in drug removal increase mortality by 30% (N Engl J Med 2012). 2. A JCV antibody index above 1.5 confers the highest PML risk; biannual monitoring of index levels informs risk stratification and imaging frequency. 3. IRIS typically manifests two to eight weeks after natalizumab removal; differentiating IRIS from PML progression relies on new gadolinium enhancement and mass effect on MRI. 4. No antiviral therapy has demonstrated survival benefit; avoid off-label use of cidofovir outside clinical trials due to nephrotoxicity and lack of efficacy. 5. Plasma exchange accelerates natalizumab clearance, enabling immune recovery; remember the mnemonic STOP JCV (Stop therapy, Plasma exchange, Observe for IRIS, Prevent via index monitoring, Vigilant imaging).","references":"1.

Baclofen (B) improves overall spasticity via GABA-B agonism but does not reliably abort brief tonic spasms. Gabapentin (C) modulates \u03b12\u03b4 calcium channels and treats neuropathic pain, lacking evidence in paroxysmal spasms. Clonazepam (D) has limited effect on ephaptic transmission and carries sedation risk.","conceptual_foundation":"Paroxysmal tonic spasms in MS arise from abnormal ephaptic transmission across demyelinated corticospinal fibers. In ICD-11, MS is code 8A40, and paroxysmal symptoms are recognized complications. Differential includes epileptic seizures and stiff-person syndrome. Historical accounts date back to Charcot\u2019s descriptions of Lhermitte\u2019s phenomenon. Neuroanatomy involves focal demyelination in the internal capsule or spinal cord; embryologic disruption of oligodendrocyte maturation underlies lesion formation.","pathophysiology":"Normal myelinated axons use saltatory conduction; demyelination in MS lowers the threshold for spontaneous impulse generation and cross-talk between adjacent fibers. This ephaptic coupling produces abrupt, painful muscle contractions. Carbamazepine prolongs the inactivated state of sodium channels, reducing high-frequency repetitive firing. Baclofen\u2019s presynaptic GABA-B action reduces neurotransmitter release but does not counteract axonal hyperexcitability effectively.","clinical_manifestation":"Tonic spasms present as brief (<2 minutes), stereotyped, painful flexor or extensor contractions, triggered by movement or sensory stimuli, occurring in ~10\u201325% of MS patients.

MRI commonly demonstrates periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal lesions fulfilling 2017 McDonald criteria. Gadolinium enhancement in 25%\u201340% of new plaques correlates with active inflammation. Annualized relapse rates on no therapy average 0.8\u20131.2, but with first\u2010line interferons decline by 30%\u201350%. Option B (Primary progressive MS) presents with insidious, steadily worsening symptoms over at least one year, without clear attacks or remissions; it accounts for only 10%\u201315% of MS cases and lacks gadolinium\u2010enhancing relapses. Option C (Transverse myelitis) is typically a monophasic illness affecting one spinal segment, often postinfectious or parainfectious, with sensory level and urinary retention but no disseminated brain lesions. Option D (Neuromyelitis optica) often shows severe bilateral optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis spanning \u22653 vertebral segments, and aquaporin\u20104 IgG positivity in 70%\u201380% of cases. Common misconceptions include conflating any demyelinating episode with NMO or transverse myelitis. The pathophysiology of RRMS\u2014autoreactive Th1/Th17 cells breaching the blood\u2013brain barrier, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, and partial remyelination\u2014definitively matches her episodic course and MRI findings. Recent guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and ECTRIMS reinforce early high\u2010efficacy treatment in RRMS to reduce conversion to secondary progressive disease by approximately 50% at five years.","conceptual_foundation":"The central nervous system structures most affected in RRMS include periventricular white matter adjacent to the lateral ventricles, juxtacortical U\u2010fibers, corpus callosum, brainstem tracts (medial longitudinal fasciculus), cerebellar peduncles, and dorsal columns of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord. During embryogenesis, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells derived from the ventricular zone migrate along radial glial scaffolds and differentiate into mature myelinating cells by mid\u2010gestation. Myelin sheaths facilitate saltatory conduction via clustering of voltage\u2010gated sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier. Disruption to this architecture slows conduction velocity and predisposes to conduction block under inflammatory stress. Related demyelinating conditions include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (monophasic, postinfectious), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (astrocytopathy), and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (peripheral nerves). Jean\u2010Martin Charcot first described sclerotic plaques in 1868; Gordon Holmes detailed visual pathway involvement in 1919. The pioneering McDonald criteria (2001) evolved to incorporate MRI dissemination in time and space (2005, 2010, 2017). Key anatomic landmarks guiding clinical localization include the internal capsule for motor deficits, medial lemniscus for proprioception loss, and periaqueductal gray in brainstem syndromes causing internuclear ophthalmoplegia.","pathophysiology":"MS pathogenesis arises from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. HLA\u2010DRB1*15:01 allele increases MS risk threefold in Caucasians, alongside non\u2010HLA loci such as IL2RA and IL7R polymorphisms. Breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier involves upregulation of ICAM\u20101 and VCAM\u20101 on endothelium, permitting entry of autoreactive CD4+ Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes. These cells secrete interferon\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u201017, and granzyme B, causing oligodendrocyte apoptosis and myelin proteolysis. Complement activation and microglial phagocytosis exacerbate demyelination. Demyelinated axons redistribute sodium channels along the internode, increasing metabolic demand and leading to reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange, calcium overload, and eventual axonal transection. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells attempt remyelination within weeks, but inhibitory molecules such as LINGO\u20101 and CSPGs impede repair. Chronic plaques show gliotic scarring and irreversible axonal loss. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals decreased N\u2010acetylaspartate as an axonal integrity marker. The time course includes acute demyelination (days), subacute remyelination (weeks), and chronic neurodegeneration (months to years). Despite compensatory cortical reorganization, cumulative injury eventually overwhelms neural reserve, resulting in disability progression.","clinical_manifestation":"RRMS typically presents in women aged 20\u201340, with a female:male ratio of approximately 3:1. Onset features evolve over hours or days and peak within two weeks. Common initial symptoms include optic neuritis (20%\u201330%), presenting as unilateral painful vision loss over 3\u20137 days, and sensory disturbances or weakness in a limb, often corresponding to spinal or supratentorial lesions. Exam findings include spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, positive Babinski, Lhermitte\u2019s sign (electric shock sensations on neck flexion), and varying degrees of sensory loss (pinprick, vibration). Cognitive impairment, fatigue (affecting 80%), bladder/bowel dysfunction, and depression (50%) are frequent. Pediatric cases show higher relapse rates (up to 2.5/year) and more brainstem signs; elderly cases may resemble primary progressive MS. Severity is graded by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), with scores of 1.0\u20134.0 for RRMS ambulatory patients. Red flags such as fever, encephalopathy, or rapid deterioration over days suggest alternative diagnoses like infection or vascular causes. Untreated, the mean annualized relapse rate is 0.5\u20131.0, with secondary progressive conversion in approximately 50% by 15 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis follows the 2017 McDonald criteria requiring evidence of dissemination in time and space. Step 1: perform MRI brain and spine with T2 FLAIR and T1 pre\u2010 and post\u2010gadolinium sequences. MRI sensitivity is 95%, specificity is 85% for MS. Look for\u2009\u2265\u20091 gadolinium\u2010enhancing lesion for dissemination in time, and\u2009\u2265\u20093 periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, or spinal lesions for dissemination in space. Step 2: CSF analysis showing oligoclonal IgG bands in 85%\u201390% supports the diagnosis; IgG index >0.7, cell count \u226450 cells/\u00b5L, protein 40\u201360 mg/dL. Step 3: evoked potentials; visual evoked potentials show P100 latency >115 ms in 70% of subclinical optic neuritis. Step 4: laboratory tests to exclude mimics include ANA, vitamin B12, HIV, hepatitis B/C, aquaporin\u20104 and MOG antibodies. Differential diagnoses include neuromyelitis optica (longitudinally extensive lesions \u22653 segments), ADEM (monophasic, encephalopathy), sarcoidosis (noncaseating granulomas), vasculitis. If criteria are unmet but suspicion persists, repeat MRI at 3\u20136 months. The diagnostic algorithm emphasizes early detection to initiate therapy before irreversible axonal loss.","management_principles":"Acute relapse management involves high\u2010dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days, often followed by an oral prednisone taper starting at 1 mg/kg for 10 days. Plasma exchange (1\u20131.5 total plasma volumes per session, five sessions over two weeks) is indicated for steroid\u2010refractory relapses (approximately 30% response rate). First\u2010line DMTs include interferon beta\u20101a (30 \u00b5g IM weekly or 44 \u00b5g SC thrice weekly) and glatiramer acetate (20 mg SC daily), reducing relapse rates by 30%\u201335%. High\u2010efficacy therapies include natalizumab 300 mg IV every 4 weeks (68% reduction) and ocrelizumab 600 mg IV every 6 months (46% reduction in disability progression). Second\u2010line oral agents such as fingolimod 0.5 mg orally daily and teriflunomide 14 mg daily require monitoring of lymphocyte counts and liver enzymes monthly for the first six months. Alemtuzumab (12 mg/day IV for five consecutive days at baseline and three days at month 12) is reserved for highly active disease due to risk of autoimmune cytopenias. Non\u2010pharmacological measures include 4,000 IU vitamin D3 daily, physiotherapy for spasticity, and symptomatic anticholinergics for bladder overactivity. Pregnancy planning involves transition to glatiramer acetate or discontinuation of teriflunomide six months prior to conception.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should undergo neurological evaluation and EDSS scoring every 3\u20136 months. Brain MRI is recommended annually; increase to biannual imaging for new clinical activity. Monitor complete blood count, liver function tests, and lymphocyte subsets every 3 months when on fingolimod, cladribine, or alemtuzumab. Measure serum JC virus antibody index every 6 months in natalizumab\u2010treated patients; index >1.5 correlates with increased PML risk. Screen varicella zoster IgG before fingolimod initiation; vaccinate if seronegative. Long\u2010term complications include transition to secondary progressive MS in 50% by 15 years, osteoporosis from chronic corticosteroids in 30%, depression in 50%. Prognosis metrics: 1-year relapse\u2010free rate \u226570% on DMT, 5-year disability progression reduction by 30%\u201350%. Rehabilitation services, including occupational and speech therapy, commence within 6 months of diagnosis. Educate patients on injection techniques, adherence, and infection prevention. Advise on safe driving with EDSS <6.5, and light\u2010duty work modifications until stable. Encourage engagement with National MS Society and MS International Federation support networks.","clinical_pearls":"1. The 2017 McDonald criteria allow MS diagnosis after a single attack if MRI and CSF criteria are met. 2. NEDA (no evidence of disease activity) combines clinical and MRI outcomes as a treatment goal. 3. Remember the PIRATES mnemonic: Periventricular, Infratentorial, Juxtacortical, Active, Transverse, Ovoid, Subcortical. 4. Avoid early corticosteroid tapering, which may mask subsequent relapses. 5. Emerging therapies targeting B cells (e.g., ofatumumab) show relapse reduction up to 50%. 6. Monitor JC virus index; risk stratification for natalizumab\u2010associated PML reduces incidence to <0.1% annually. 7. Vitamin D supplementation to maintain serum 25(OH)D >30 ng/mL may reduce relapse risk by 20%. 8. Fatigue and depression correlate more with quality of life than EDSS score. 9. Bedside tips: test for Lhermitte\u2019s sign and perform gait analysis to detect subtle impairments. 10. Cost considerations: generic interferons cost 50% less with similar efficacy profiles.","references":"1. Compston A, Coles A. Multiple sclerosis. Lancet. 2008;372(9648):1502\u201317.

In patients treated with natalizumab, a high anti-JC virus antibody index (\u22651.5) is the most significant risk factor for developing PML, with an annual incidence of 4.2 per 1,000 in those with index above 1.5 and duration of therapy exceeding 24 months (Bloomgren et al., 2012; NEJM). Option A is incorrect because a low index (<0.9) correlates with minimal PML risk (<0.09 per 1,000 per year). Option C is incorrect; migraine history has no association with JC virus reactivation or PML risk. Option D is not supported by evidence, as age over 60 has not shown independent correlation after adjusting for key risk factors, with multivariate hazard ratio 1.1 (p=0.4). A common misconception is conflating serum JCV DNA levels with antibody index, but it is the serological index that guides risk stratification.","conceptual_foundation":"Risk stratification for natalizumab-associated PML involves three key factors: duration of therapy, prior immunosuppressant use, and anti-JCV antibody index. The JCV serological index is determined by ELISA quantification of antibodies against the viral VP1 capsid protein and classified as low (<0.9), indeterminate (0.9\u20131.5), and high (>1.5). In ICD-11, PML risk factors fall under adverse effects of immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents (PL14). The concept of antibody index emerged from pharmacovigilance registries in 2006 and was formalized in 2013, enabling algorithmic risk stratification in clinical practice. This classification situates PML within iatrogenic infections in neuroimmunology.","pathophysiology":"A high JCV antibody index indicates robust humoral response secondary to increased viral replication and dissemination. Natalizumab\u2019s blockade of alpha4-integrin impairs immune surveillance, permitting latent JC virus to reactivate in peripheral lymphoid tissue and cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. Elevated antibody titers correlate with higher circulating viral particles and greater CNS seeding potential. Low indices suggest na\u00efve serostatus or limited viral replication, translating to reduced PML risk.","clinical_manifestation":"Risk stratification does not alter PML clinical presentation, which remains characterized by subacute neurologic deficits such as visual field cuts, hemiparesis, and cognitive changes. High-index patients warrant more frequent surveillance imaging but do not present differently symptomatically. MRI monitoring frequency is adjusted based on index category, with scans every three months for high-index and every six to twelve months for low-index patients.","diagnostic_approach":"High-index patients require heightened vigilance. First-tier: brain MRI every three months (Level B recommendation) to detect early PML lesions. Second-tier: prompt CSF PCR for JC virus if new neurologic deficits or MRI changes arise. In high-index patients, pre-test probability of PML is approximately 4.2 per 1,000 per year, raising positive predictive value of CSF PCR to around 89%. In low-index patients, routine CSF PCR is low-yield.","management_principles":"For patients with high JCV index and prolonged natalizumab exposure, discuss treatment modification after 24 months by transitioning to therapies with lower PML risk, such as interferon beta or glatiramer acetate. No proven prophylactic antivirals exist. Shared decision-making should incorporate index trends, MRI findings, and patient preferences.","follow_up_guidelines":"High-index patients should undergo neurologic exam and brain MRI every three months, with annual JCV index reassessment. Consider MRI surveillance extension intervals for low-index patients to six to twelve months. Treatment adjustments should be considered when index rises above 1.5 or seroconversion occurs.","clinical_pearls":"1. A JCV antibody index exceeding 1.5 places patients at highest PML risk; monitor index biannually. 2. Low-index patients (<0.9) have minimal PML risk and can follow standard imaging protocols. 3. Migraine history does not influence PML risk. 4. Seroconversion during natalizumab therapy necessitates closer surveillance and reevaluation of treatment strategy. 5. Age by itself is not an independent PML risk factor; focus management on index and treatment duration.","references":"1. Bloomgren G, Richman S, Hotermans C, et al.
