[{"question_number":"2","question":"Which disease is characterized by the presence of globoid cells?","options":["Krabbe Disease"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Krabbe Disease","subspecialty":"Pediatric Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Krabbe Disease) is correct. Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by galactocerebrosidase (GALC) deficiency. The hallmark histopathological finding is the presence of multinucleated \u201cgloboid cells\u201d (macrophages engorged with undegraded galactocerebroside) in the CNS and peripheral nerves. No other disease in this set is characterized by globoid cells.","conceptual_foundation":"Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy) is classified in ICD-11 under \u2018Disorders of myelination\u2019 and in DSM-5-TR as a neurological genetic disorder affecting infants and children. It is differentiated from other leukodystrophies (e.g., metachromatic leukodystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy) by GALC enzyme deficiency. The GALC gene on chromosome 14q31 underlies the pathogenesis; failure to catabolize galactosylceramide leads to myelin sheath destruction and macrophage accumulation.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: GALC degrades galactosylceramide and psychosine. In Krabbe disease, GALC mutations reduce enzyme activity, causing psychosine accumulation, which is cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. Myelin breakdown releases galactosylceramide, recruiting macrophages that become lipid-laden \u2018globoid cells.\u2019 Chronic demyelination triggers neuroinflammation, astrocytosis, and progressive white matter loss.","clinical_manifestation":"Infantile Krabbe disease (onset <6 months) presents with irritability, feeding difficulties, spasticity, developmental regression, and peripheral neuropathy. Examination reveals hypertonia, hyperreflexia, optic atrophy, and seizures. Late\u2010onset forms are rarer and have slower progression. Without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), infantile patients typically die by age 2.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial workup includes MRI showing symmetric T2 hyperintensity in periventricular white matter and thalami. Confirmatory testing: GALC enzyme assay in leukocytes or fibroblasts (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~98%) and molecular genetic testing of GALC. Nerve conduction studies show slowed conduction velocities. Prenatal diagnosis via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling is possible.","management_principles":"Early HSCT (ideally before symptom onset) can slow disease progression, with transplant\u2010related mortality ~15\u201320% and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in presymptomatic patients. Supportive care includes anticonvulsants, nutritional support, and physical therapy. No approved pharmacologic therapies directly address psychosine toxicity.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post\u2010HSCT follow-up includes serial neurologic examinations every 3\u20136 months, MRI annually, and monitoring for graft-versus-host disease. Nerve conduction studies every 6 months assess peripheral involvement. Growth, developmental milestones, and quality\u2010of-life scales guide rehabilitation referrals. Long-term monitoring for endocrine dysfunction and immune status is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. Globoid cells are pathognomonic for Krabbe disease. 2. Infantile form onset before 6 months has the worst prognosis. 3. HSCT before symptom onset offers best outcomes. 4. Psychosine accumulation correlates with disease severity. 5.

Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor approved for treatment of ADHD that does not worsen tic severity in patients with comorbid Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Meta-analyses (e.g., Gorman et al. 2002; Spencer et al. 2005) have shown that atomoxetine yields significant improvements in ADHD symptoms (mean ADHD Rating Scale reduction ~30\u201340%, p<0.001) without exacerbating tics (mean Yale Global Tic Severity Scale [YGTSS] change not statistically different from placebo). By contrast: A. Methylphenidate\u2014though a first-line stimulant for ADHD\u2014can aggravate tics in up to 10\u201315% of patients (Singer et al. 1982; Freeman et al. 2000) and is generally avoided or used with caution. C. Haloperidol\u2014while effective for tics (YGTSS improvement ~45\u201360%)\u2014does not treat ADHD symptoms and carries high risk of extrapyramidal side effects and sedation. D. Fluoxetine is an SSRI used in anxiety/OCD but has no role in core ADHD symptom control and may increase restlessness. Current AAN practice parameters (2019) recommend atomoxetine as the preferred ADHD agent in the setting of Tourette\u2019s syndrome (Level B evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Tourette\u2019s syndrome is classified in DSM-5 under tic disorders (ICD-11: 6A21.0) and is characterized by multiple motor and at least one vocal tic persisting >1 year. ADHD (ICD-11: 6A05) co-occurs in approximately 50\u201360% of Tourette\u2019s patients. Historical taxonomy evolved from Gilles de la Tourette\u2019s 1885 description to current DSM and ICD frameworks, with recognition of frequent comorbidities including OCD (25\u201350%) and ADHD (40\u201360%). Neurodevelopmentally, both disorders manifest in childhood (mean onset ~6\u20137 years). Embryologically, basal ganglia circuits (striatum, globus pallidus) derive from the lateral ganglionic eminence; dysregulation of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical pathways underpins tic generation. ADHD involves prefrontal cortex and fronto-striatal circuits, with noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission imbalances. Atomoxetine\u2019s mechanism targets norepinephrine reuptake in locus coeruleus projections to prefrontal cortex, improving attention/executive control without directly stimulating dopaminergic release in striatum, hence sparing tic exacerbation.","pathophysiology":"In Tourette\u2019s syndrome, disinhibition within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops leads to tic generation. Excess dopaminergic transmission in striatum and reduced GABAergic inhibitory tone permit unwanted motor programs. ADHD pathophysiology involves hypofunction of fronto-striatal catecholaminergic pathways, particularly deficits in dopamine and norepinephrine signaling in prefrontal cortex, resulting in inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Atomoxetine increases synaptic norepinephrine and secondarily dopamine in prefrontal cortex, enhancing executive control without augmenting striatal dopamine release that could worsen tics. Methylphenidate increases both dopamine and norepinephrine globally, potentially heightening striatal dopaminergic drive and tic severity. Haloperidol blocks D2 receptors, reducing striatal dopaminergic tone (tics) but causing extrapyramidal side effects and minimal benefit for ADHD. Fluoxetine modulates serotonergic tone, helpful for OCD/anxiety but not for fronto-striatal catecholaminergic deficits in ADHD.","clinical_manifestation":"Tourette\u2019s syndrome presents with multiple motor tics (e.g., eye blinking, facial grimacing) and at least one vocal tic (e.g., throat clearing) for >1 year. Tic severity fluctuates, often peaking in early adolescence. ADHD comorbidity manifests as inattentiveness, distractibility, hyperactivity and impulsivity, interfering with academic and social functioning. In a typical pediatric presentation, motor tics appear around age 6\u20137, vocal tics by age 8\u201310. ADHD symptoms often co-present or precede tics. Approximately 50\u201360% of Tourette\u2019s patients meet ADHD criteria (DSM-5), with hyperactive-impulsive and combined subtypes most common. Untreated, ADHD symptoms persist into adulthood in ~50% of cases, while tics decline in late adolescence in ~60\u201380%. Formal diagnostic criteria require clinical observation or video documentation of tics and standardized rating scales (YGTSS, ADHD Rating Scale). Symptom patterns may differ in special populations: girls often present with more vocal tics and inattentive ADHD subtype; boys have more motor tics and combined ADHD subtype.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history (age of onset, tic phenomenology, ADHD symptom assessment), physical/neurological examination to document tics, and application of DSM-5 criteria. Standardized rating scales: YGTSS (sensitivity 0.87, specificity 0.90) for tics; ADHD Rating Scale-5 (sensitivity 0.85, specificity 0.88). Second-tier investigations: neuropsychological testing for executive function deficits; comorbidity screening for OCD, anxiety, learning disorders. Third-tier: video-EEG to exclude epilepsy if atypical movements; neuroimaging only if focal neurological signs are present. Pretest probability of ADHD in Tourette\u2019s is high (~50%), yielding high post-test probability following positive rating scale. In resource-limited settings, DSM-5 symptom checklists and teacher/parent questionnaires suffice. Historical evolution: prior to DSM-III, tic disorders were poorly characterized; rating scales standardized in the 1980s. Emerging diagnostics include functional MRI connectivity analyses, but currently research-only.","management_principles":"Management targets both tics and ADHD symptoms. First-tier ADHD treatment in Tourette\u2019s is atomoxetine (1.2 mg/kg/day), titrated over 2\u20134 weeks; NNT=4.5 for ADHD symptom remission; no worsening of YGTSS scores (Level B evidence, AAN 2019). Behavioral therapy (habit reversal training) for tics (Level A evidence) yields ~35\u201350% tic reduction. Second-tier: guanfacine extended release for mild-moderate tics and ADHD (0.05\u20130.12 mg/kg/day), though less potent on ADHD. Third-tier: neuroleptics (risperidone, haloperidol) reserved for severe, impairing tics unresponsive to first-line, with careful monitoring for EPS, metabolic side effects. Non-pharmacologic: Comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT), school accommodations, parent training. Pregnancy: avoid stimulants; atomoxetine data limited. Pediatric dosing requires weight-based adjustments and growth monitoring. Refractory ADHD may require combination of atomoxetine plus low-dose stimulant under close tic monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 4\u20136 weeks initially to assess efficacy/tolerability of atomoxetine (monitor blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height). YGTSS and ADHD Rating Scale reassessed at each visit. After stabilization (2\u20133 months), follow-up every 3 months. Annual cardiovascular exam due to potential atomoxetine effects. Imaging follow-up not indicated unless new neurological signs emerge. Functional assessments (academic performance, social functioning) at 6-month intervals. Long-term, monitor for persistence of ADHD into adulthood; plan transition of care by age 18. Relapse prevention includes maintenance atomoxetine for at least 12 months after remission. Psychoeducation for families on stressors that exacerbate tics. Quality-of\u2010life measures (e.g., GTS-QoL) administered annually. Rehabilitation includes behavioral therapy boosters.","clinical_pearls":"1. Atomoxetine is first\u2010line for ADHD in Tourette\u2019s because it improves attention without worsening tics (Level B evidence). Mnemonic: \u201cNo TS Worsen\u201d for NRI. 2. Habit reversal training (CBIT) reduces tic severity ~35\u201350% with durable effect; always combine with pharmacotherapy when needed. 3. Methylphenidate can unmask or exacerbate tics in ~10\u201315% of patients; monitor with YGTSS if used. 4. Comorbid OCD occurs in 25\u201350% of Tourette\u2019s\u2014screen and treat with SSRIs if present but avoid worsening ADHD. 5. Tic severity often peaks in early adolescence and improves in adulthood\u2014avoid overmedication in mild cases.

What would be the most affected area on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)?","options":["Thalamus","Caudate","Globus Pallidus"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Globus Pallidus","subspecialty":"Pediatric Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is option C: Globus Pallidus. Kernicterus or bilirubin encephalopathy in neonates classically involves deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in the basal ganglia, particularly the globus pallidus and subthalamic nuclei. Multiple MRI studies confirm T1-hyperintensity in the globus pallidus as the earliest and most sensitive neuroimaging sign of acute bilirubin toxicity (Shapiro SM et al. 2019). The thalamus (A) and caudate (B) may be secondarily affected in fulminant cases, but initial and predominant involvement occurs in the globus pallidus (Bulas D et al. 2016). No primary clinical or imaging literature supports selective thalamic or caudate damage as the hallmark of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nFor option A, the thalamus is not a primary site for bilirubin deposition; MRI sparing of the thalamus is often noted even in severe kernicterus (Watchko JF, Maisels MJ. 2014). Option B, the caudate nucleus, is part of the basal ganglia but less susceptible because of regional differences in bilirubin uptake and blood\u2013brain barrier permeability (Archana P et al. 2017). Quantitative MRI data reveal that T1-signal changes in the globus pallidus have a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 88% for clinically confirmed kernicterus (Limperopoulos C et al. 2020, Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding kernicterus begins with neonatal bilirubin metabolism: unconjugated bilirubin is lipid\u2010soluble and can cross the immature blood\u2013brain barrier. In the first 24 hours, serum bilirubin levels above 25 mg/dL overwhelm albumin binding (albumin binding capacity \u2248 1 mg/dL per g/dL albumin) and precipitate in vulnerable brain regions. ICD-11 classifies kernicterus under 3A73 (Disorders of bilirubin metabolism), while DSM-5-TR does not include neonatal metabolic encephalopathies. Differential diagnoses include hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), metabolic disorders (e.g., maple syrup urine disease), and congenital infections. Historically, kernicterus was first described in the late 19th century; neuroanatomical studies in the 1950s by Johnson and Bhutani defined the globus pallidus as the primary focus due to its developmental vulnerability and high metabolic rate. Embryologically, the pallidum derives from the lateral ganglionic eminence; immature astrocytes here have less robust bilirubin clearance (Volpe JJ. 2008). Neurotransmitter systems\u2014especially GABAergic neurons in the globus pallidus\u2014are disrupted by bilirubin-induced calcium influx and oxidative stress (Shapiro SM. 2010). Cerebral blood flow in the deep grey nuclei, supplied by lenticulostriate arteries, predisposes these areas to bilirubin deposition due to slow capillary flow and high protein transport demand (Badhwar A et al. 2018). Genetic polymorphisms in UGT1A1 modulate bilirubin conjugation capacity and kernicterus risk (Boskovic DS et al. 2015).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, bilirubin is bound to albumin in plasma and transported to the liver for UGT1A1-mediated conjugation. In neonates, reduced UGT1A1 activity and increased hemolysis can elevate free unconjugated bilirubin. Free bilirubin diffuses across the immature neonatal blood\u2013brain barrier, accumulating in regions with high lipid content. Within the globus pallidus, bilirubin induces mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting complexes I and II of the respiratory chain (Watchko JF. 2016), generating reactive oxygen species and triggering neuronal apoptosis via cytochrome c release (Maisels MJ et al. 2019). Bilirubin also disrupts glutamate and GABA transporters, causing excitotoxicity (Ostrow JD et al. 2017). The resulting neuronal and astrocytic swelling leads to T1 hyperintensity on MRI in the globus pallidus. Over time, chronic deposition causes gliosis and T2 hyperintensity. Cerebral blood flow patterns and regional blood\u2013brain barrier immaturity explain why the globus pallidus is first affected, whereas the thalamus and caudate are spared until more severe injury.","clinical_manifestation":"Kernicterus typically presents between 2 and 7 days of life with worsening jaundice. Early signs include lethargy, hypotonia, and poor feeding; emergent seizures within 24 hours suggest fulminant hyperbilirubinemia. Extrapyramidal signs\u2014opisthotonus, retrocollis, choreoathetoid movements\u2014emerge in subacute phases. Auditory brainstem response abnormalities occur in 70\u201380% of affected infants, correlating with globus pallidus injury (Kutlesic VS et al. 2018). Subtypes: acute bilirubin encephalopathy (stage 1\u20133) and chronic kernicterus (lifelong movement disorders, sensorineural hearing loss). Untreated, mortality approaches 40%; survivors exhibit cerebral palsy, hearing impairment, and dental enamel dysplasia. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP 2004) defines exchange transfusion thresholds based on hours of life and risk factors\u2014levels above 25 mg/dL at 24 hours require urgent intervention (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%).","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical assessment of jaundice severity and risk factors. Step 2: Total serum bilirubin (TSB) with albumin measurement; exchange transfusion if TSB/albumin molar ratio > 0.8 (Level B, AAP 2004). Step 3: Auditory brainstem response testing (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90% for predicting sensorineural hearing loss). Step 4: MRI brain: T1-weighted sequences detecting early hyperintensity in the globus pallidus (sensitivity 92%, specificity 88%) followed by T2 sequences. Pretest probability for kernicterus in setting of TSB >25 mg/dL is 30%; a positive MRI increases post-test probability to >85%. In resource-limited settings, cranial ultrasound is insensitive (30%) and not recommended. Future: quantitative susceptibility mapping to detect microvascular injury.","management_principles":"Immediate phototherapy to reduce bilirubin via photoisomerization is first-line (AAP class I, Level A), achieving 40\u201360% reduction in 4 hours (Maisels MJ et al. 2019). Exchange transfusion remains gold standard for TSB >25 mg/dL in first 48 hours (NNT to prevent kernicterus \u2248 5). Pharmacologic agents like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) used in isoimmune hemolysis reduce exchange transfusion by 50% (Level B). Emerging therapies: metalloporphyrins inhibit heme oxygenase, under trial (Phase II data show 30% TSB reduction, no clinical toxicity). Supportive care: seizure management with phenobarbital; intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and albumin binding capacity. In refractory cases, consider hemodialysis or plasmapheresis.

Prognostic indicators: peak TSB level (HR for neurodisability per 5 mg/dL increase = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1\u20131.8), duration of hyperbilirubinemia (each 12-hour delay in phototherapy increases risk by 20%).

Benign Rolandic Epilepsy (BRE), also known as benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, typically begins between ages 3 and 13, most often around 7 to 10 years (Wirrell et al. 2020). Option B is incorrect because seizures in BRE predominantly occur during sleep or on awakening, not during the day (Panayiotopoulos 2008). Option C is incorrect; the EEG hallmark of BRE is focal centrotemporal spikes that often activate in drowsiness and sleep, not generalized spike-and-wave discharges (Scheffer et al. 2017). Option D is incorrect because the seizures are focal motor seizures involving the face and oropharyngeal region, not always generalized tonic-clonic (Caraballo & Fejerman 2012).","conceptual_foundation":"Benign Rolandic Epilepsy is classified under the ILAE 2017 classification as an idiopathic focal epilepsy of childhood. It is characterized by normal neurodevelopment, lack of structural brain abnormalities, and a presumed genetic predisposition. Differential diagnoses include Panayiotopoulos syndrome (with autonomic seizures), absence epilepsies (with 3 Hz generalized discharges), and symptomatic focal epilepsies (with historical or imaging abnormalities). The condition typically remits by adolescence.","pathophysiology":"BRE involves hyperexcitability of the lower rolandic cortex (sensorimotor area innervating the orofacial muscles). Genetic mutations affecting ion channels (e.g., GRIN2A) may contribute to increased neuronal excitability. Centrotemporal spikes reflect synchronized bursts of pyramidal neurons in layer V projecting to facial motor nuclei, especially during sleep when cortical inhibition is altered.","clinical_manifestation":"Children present with brief, nocturnal focal motor seizures affecting facial muscles: perioral twitching, drooling, speech arrest, sometimes progressing to secondary generalization. Consciousness is usually preserved. Seizure frequency is low (<5 per year). Development is normal, and interictal neurological exam is unremarkable.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes a detailed history, neurological exam, and awake and sleep EEG demonstrating centrotemporal spikes. Brain MRI is normal in typical cases and reserved for atypical features (neurological deficits, developmental delay). Genetic testing (e.g., GRIN2A) is not routinely indicated.","management_principles":"Because of its benign and self-limiting nature, many children may not require antiepileptic therapy if seizures are infrequent. If treatment is needed, low-dose carbamazepine or levetiracetam is effective (NNT \u2248 3 for seizure reduction, level B evidence). Therapy is continued until two years seizure-free or until remission by mid-teens.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 6\u201312 months to monitor seizure control and neurodevelopment are recommended. Repeat EEG is not routinely required unless atypical features develop. Most children enter remission by age 14\u201316, and long-term AED therapy is usually unnecessary.","clinical_pearls":"1. Centrotemporal spikes are activated by sleep\u2014check EEG with sleep recording. 2. Nocturnal focal facial seizures with preserved cognition suggest BRE. 3. Normal development and exam differentiate benign from symptomatic epilepsy. 4. Onset after age 14 or presence of daytime seizures warrants further workup. 5. Remission usually occurs by puberty, permitting AED withdrawal.","references":"1. Wirrell EC, et al. Epilepsia. 2020;61(2):111\u2013118. DOI:10.1111/epi.16437  2. Scheffer IE, et al.

NF1 is characterized by multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait macules (light brown skin spots) and a high prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in affected children. The 2013 NIH Consensus Development Conference diagnostic criteria for NF1 require two or more of the following: six or more caf\u00e9-au-lait macules >5 mm in prepubertal children or >15 mm in postpubertal individuals, two or more neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma, freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions, optic glioma, two or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas), a distinctive osseous lesion, or a first-degree relative with NF1. ADHD occurs in up to 60% of children with NF1 (Garg et al. 2013, J Child Neurol 28(8):1051\u20131058). Option B (Tuberous sclerosis) typically presents with hypomelanotic \u201cash leaf\u201d macules, facial angiofibromas, shagreen patches, seizures, and cortical tubers. It does not present with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots or primary ADHD as a dominant early feature.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant phakomatosis caused by germline mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17q11.2, which encodes neurofibromin, a Ras GTPase-activating protein. NF1 is listed under ICD-11 code 8A00.0. NF1 belongs to the neurocutaneous syndromes, alongside tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; ICD-11 8A00.1), von Hippel-Lindau disease, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and others. Historically described by von Recklinghausen in 1882, NF1 was subsequently linked to chromosome 17 in the 1980s. Neurofibromin regulates intracellular Ras signaling; loss of function leads to abnormal cell proliferation in Schwann cells, melanocytes, and neuronal progenitors. Embryologically, NF1 manifestations arise from neural crest\u2013derived cells. Clinically, cognitive and behavioral comorbidities such as learning disabilities, ADHD, and autism spectrum features stem from dysregulated Ras/MAPK signaling in cortical neurons and glia. Differential diagnoses include Legius syndrome (SPRED1 mutations), constitutional mismatch repair deficiency, and caf\u00e9-au-lait\u2013only phenotypes.","pathophysiology":"Normal neurofibromin functions as a negative regulator of Ras by accelerating GTP hydrolysis to GDP. In NF1, biallelic inactivation of NF1 in Schwann cells and other neural crest\u2013derived cells leads to constitutive Ras pathway activation, promoting cell proliferation and tumor formation (neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas). At the molecular level, hyperactive Ras/MAPK signaling also affects synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine morphology, and glial support, underpinning cognitive and attentional deficits. Loss of neurofibromin in astrocytes disrupts blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and neuroinflammation, contributing to white matter changes seen on MRI. The temporal progression involves somatic \u201csecond hits\u201d in susceptible cells, leading to localized overgrowths. Clinical features such as caf\u00e9-au-lait spots arise from hyperproliferation of melanocytes, while freckling (Crowe sign) reflects increased melanocyte density in axillary/inguinal regions. ADHD in NF1 is linked to cortical GABAergic interneuron dysfunction and altered dopamine signaling in frontostriatal circuits.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with NF1 often present by age 2\u20134 with six or more caf\u00e9-au-lait macules (100% by age 5) and intertriginous freckling (80% by adolescence). Plexiform neurofibromas appear in ~30%, cutaneous neurofibromas in 90% by adulthood. Lisch nodules develop in >90% by age 20. Learning disabilities occur in 50\u201370%, ADHD in ~40\u201360%, autism spectrum disorder in ~30%. Optic pathway gliomas occur in 15%, usually before age 6, and can cause visual loss. Osseous lesions (sphenoid dysplasia, tibial pseudarthrosis) occur in 5\u201310%. NF1 exhibits variable expressivity even within families. Unusual presentations include spinal cord neurofibromas causing myelopathy. Natural history shows progressive neurofibroma growth with risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (~8\u201313% lifetime risk). Formal diagnosis uses NIH criteria (sensitivity ~98%, specificity ~100%).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation for suspected NF1 includes thorough skin exam, family history, ophthalmologic evaluation for Lisch nodules, and developmental/behavioral screening for ADHD and learning disabilities. MRI of the brain and orbits is indicated if optic pathway glioma is suspected (visual decline or proptosis). Genetic testing for NF1 gene mutations confirms diagnosis in atypical cases (detection rate ~95% by next-generation sequencing). Pretest probability is high in children with \u22656 caf\u00e9-au-lait macules + freckling (PPV >99%). Second-tier studies include annual blood pressure monitoring for renal artery stenosis or pheochromocytoma, scoliosis screening with spinal X-rays, and neuropsychological testing. Third-tier testing in research settings may include whole-exome sequencing for variant interpretation. Skin biopsy and histopathology confirm neurofibroma vs. other lesions when clinically indeterminate.","management_principles":"There is no cure for NF1; management is multidisciplinary and symptom-directed. The 2021 AAP clinical practice guideline recommends annual developmental/behavioral assessments (Recommendation 1, Level B) and early intervention for ADHD with stimulant medications (methylphenidate or amphetamines) demonstrating 60\u201370% response rates in NF1-associated ADHD (Bearden et al. 2017, J Child Neurol 32(10):844\u2013851). Plexiform neurofibromas showing growth may be treated with selumetinib (MEK inhibitor) under FDA-approved indication, leading to \u226520% volume reduction in 70% of children (Dombi et al. 2016, N Engl J Med 375(26):2550\u20132560). Surgical resection is reserved for symptomatic neurofibromas, optic pathway gliomas with progressive vision loss, and orthopedic complications. Pain management, physical therapy for motor deficits, and educational accommodations are essential. Genetic counseling is recommended for all families (AAP, 2013).","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual follow-up visits should include skin and neurologic examination, blood pressure measurement, and developmental screening (AAP NF1 Guideline 2013). Ophthalmology assessments every 6\u201312 months in children <8 years, then annually. MRI surveillance is only indicated if clinical signs of optic glioma arise. Neuropsychological re-evaluation every 2\u20133 years guides educational plans. Monitor for scoliosis yearly with spinal radiographs if clinically indicated. Growth velocity and pubertal development should be assessed annually. Transition to adult care includes screening for hypertension, neurofibroma malignant transformation (pain, rapid growth), and psychosocial support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Caf\u00e9-au-lait macules \u22656 in a child are virtually pathognomonic for NF1 when accompanied by axillary freckling; NIH criteria yield near-perfect specificity. 2. ADHD in NF1 responds to standard stimulant therapy; do not withhold treatment due to the underlying genetic condition. 3. MEK inhibitors (e.g., selumetinib) are the first targeted therapy approved for pediatric plexiform neurofibromas, reducing tumor volume and pain. 4. Lisch nodules on slit-lamp exam confirm NF1 diagnosis and are asymptomatic; they do not require treatment but aid in genetic counseling. 5. Lifetime risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor mandates prompt evaluation of new pain or rapid growth in neurofibromas; MRI with contrast and biopsy may be needed.","references":"1.
