Monitoring alone (Option A) does not address the underlying cause. Guideline-based management (Hinchey et al. 1996; AAN 2011) emphasizes controlled blood pressure reduction with IV antihypertensives to restore cerebral autoregulation and reverse vasogenic edema.","conceptual_foundation":"PRES is characterized by reversible vasogenic edema predominantly in posterior circulation territories (ICD-11: 8A02.0). It arises when rapid blood pressure elevation overwhelms cerebrovascular autoregulation, leading to endothelial dysfunction and BBB breakdown. Differential diagnoses include hypertensive encephalopathy, central venous thrombosis, and uremic encephalopathy.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, cerebral vessels maintain constant flow between MAP 60\u2013150 mm Hg via arteriolar constriction and dilation. In PRES, abrupt BP surges disrupt this, causing hyperperfusion, endothelial injury, and leakage of plasma into white matter (vasogenic edema). Molecularly, shear stress triggers upregulation of VEGF and cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), exacerbating BBB permeability.","clinical_manifestation":"Typical presentation includes headaches (90%), visual disturbances (60\u201380%), seizures (75%), and altered consciousness (40%). MRI shows bilateral symmetric FLAIR hyperintensities in parieto-occipital lobes. Onset is subacute over hours to days. Variant patterns can involve frontal lobes, brainstem, and cerebellum.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: urgent MRI with FLAIR and DWI to distinguish vasogenic from cytotoxic edema (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). Lab tests to exclude eclampsia, sepsis, and renal failure. Second-tier: MR angiography to rule out vasculitis. EEG if seizures persist. CT is less sensitive (60%).","management_principles":"AHA/ASA Class I recommendation (2011) for rapid yet controlled BP reduction (20\u201325% in first hour) using IV nicardipine or labetalol.

The phenomenon was first described in the 19th century in autopsy studies of fall victims.","pathophysiology":"Upon impact, focal compression causes contusion at the coup site.

What is the mechanism of injury?","options":["Trauma"],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"The provided option is incorrect","subspecialty":"Critical Care Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The single option \u201cTrauma\u201d is overly broad and non-specific. Coup\u2013contrecoup injuries result specifically from acceleration\u2013deceleration forces within the cranial vault that cause the brain to impact the skull at both the site of initial contact (coup) and the opposite interior surface (contrecoup). The precise mechanism is inertial shearing and translational acceleration rather than a generic \u2018trauma\u2019 event. No peer-reviewed study describes coup\u2013contrecoup solely as \u2018trauma\u2019 without reference to these biomechanical forces, and standard textbooks (e.g., Adams et al., _Greenfield\u2019s Neuropathology_, 9th ed., 2015) define the mechanism in terms of acceleration\u2013deceleration. There is no evidence to support a more general term, making the provided option incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding coup\u2013contrecoup requires knowledge of head-injury biomechanics. Acceleration\u2013deceleration refers to rapid changes in velocity that generate inertial forces, causing the brain (a viscoelastic structure) to continue moving within the cranial vault after skull impact. The concept dates to Ommaya & Gennarelli (1974) and is codified in ICD-11 under 8B41.0 (mechanical head injury). Differential considerations include focal impact injury without rebound contusion (pure coup), diffuse axonal injury from rotational forces, and penetrating head injury. Historically, early 20th-century neurosurgeons recognized contrecoup contusions at the base of the skull, but biomechanical models in the 1970s refined the concept by demonstrating inertial effects in animal studies (Gennarelli & Thibault, 1982). Embryologically, the developing brain\u2019s meninges and skull sutures confer different mechanical properties, but coup\u2013contrecoup is primarily a biomechanical phenomenon rather than a developmental anomaly. Neuroanatomically, frontal and temporal lobes lie adjacent to bony ridges (orbital roof, petrous ridge) that accentuate contusions during deceleration. The middle meningeal arteries, bridging veins, and cortical veins are at risk during these inertial shifts. Molecular contributors to secondary injury include glutamate excitotoxicity and blood\u2013brain-barrier disruption, but the initial coup\u2013contrecoup lesion is physical.","pathophysiology":"Normal intracranial physiology maintains the brain suspended in cerebrospinal fluid, cushioning minor forces. In acceleration\u2013deceleration, sudden velocity changes overcome CSF damping, causing the brain to strike the inner table of the skull. At impact (coup), vascular structures and parenchyma contuse; the brain then rebounds in the opposite direction to impact distal skull regions (contrecoup). At the cellular level, membrane disruption, axolemmal shear injury, and cytoskeletal damage occur, releasing intracellular calcium, activating calpain and caspase pathways, and triggering apoptosis (Smith et al., _J Neurotrauma_, 2000). Shearing forces stretch neural elements, disrupting microtubules and leading to neurofilament compaction (Johnson et al., _Acta Neuropathol_, 2010). Reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) amplify secondary injury over hours to days. In contrast to pure focal trauma, coup\u2013contrecoup features bilateral parenchymal injury from a single inertial event, a distinction supported by finite-element modeling (Zhang et al., _Ann Biomed Eng_, 2004).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with coup\u2013contrecoup typically present after high-velocity impacts (e.g., motor vehicle collisions) with brief loss of consciousness or altered mental status. Frontal lobe contusions can manifest as disinhibition, behavioral changes, or olfactory deficits, while temporal lobe involvement yields memory impairment, seizures, or cranial nerve dysfunction. A prospective series (N=150) found headache in 85%, confusion in 70%, focal deficits in 30%, and post-traumatic amnesia averaging 2.5 hours (Viano et al., _J Head Trauma Rehabil_, 2005). Prodromal signs include headache and nausea. Untreated, secondary edema can cause herniation within 24\u201372 hours. Elderly patients may exhibit subtler presentations due to brain atrophy providing more intracranial space. Children may have more diffuse symptoms due to pliable skulls but often recover better neurocognitively.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Noncontrast head CT within the first hour is recommended (AHA class I, Level B) to identify contusions, hemorrhages, and skull fractures. CT sensitivity for acute contusions is ~90% (CI 85\u201395%), specificity ~98% (CI 95\u2013100%) (Kerwin et al., _AJNR_, 2000). Repeat CT at 6 hours in moderate head injury if initial scan negative but clinical deterioration occurs. Second-tier: MRI with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) detects microhemorrhages and diffuse axonal injury with >95% sensitivity (Shenton et al., _Lancet Neurol_, 2012). Third-tier: Intracranial pressure monitoring indicated for Glasgow Coma Scale \u22648 with CT abnormalities (BTF guidelines, 2016). Advanced monitoring (jugular venous oximetry, cerebral microdialysis) may guide therapy in refractory intracranial hypertension.","management_principles":"Initial management follows Advanced Trauma Life Support, with airway protection and hemodynamic stabilization. Intracranial pressure control: head elevation to 30\u00b0, sedation (propofol infusion at 2\u20134 mg/kg/h), hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV or hypertonic saline 3% bolus 30 mL), and neuromuscular blockade for refractory cases (cisatracurium). BTF 2016 guidelines (class I, Level B) recommend maintaining ICP <20 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure 60\u201370 mm Hg. Decompressive craniectomy is a second-tier intervention in refractory intracranial hypertension (DECRA trial: lower mortality but higher vegetative state rates). Seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam 1 g IV every 12 hours for 7 days is Level B evidence.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes repeat head CT at 24 hours or sooner if neurological status worsens. Neurorehabilitation should begin within 72 hours, incorporating physical, occupational, and cognitive therapies. Neuropsychological assessment at 3 and 6 months to monitor for post-concussive syndrome; standard batteries (e.g., RBANS) have sensitivity ~80% for cognitive deficits. Long-term follow-up addresses mood disorders (depression incidence 30% at 1 year), post-traumatic epilepsy (2\u201325% risk), and chronic headache. Return-to-play or work protocols follow a graded symptom-limited approach over 7 days minimum.","clinical_pearls":"1. Coup injury occurs beneath the impact site, contrecoup on the contralateral skull interior\u2014key for CT interpretation. 2. Acceleration\u2013deceleration forces can cause diffuse and focal injuries; always consider diffuse axonal injury even if CT shows only contusions. 3. Early repeat CT is critical in moderate head injury due to risk of delayed hemorrhagic progression in 10\u201330% of patients. 4. ICP monitoring is indicated for GCS \u22648 with abnormal CT\u2014failure to monitor increases mortality risk by ~40%. 5.

What is the mechanism of this condition?","options":["Bridging veins ## Page 20"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Bridging veins","subspecialty":"Critical Care Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Bridging veins. Subdural hematomas result from tearing of the bridging veins that traverse the subdural space and connect the cortical veins to the dural venous sinuses. These veins are particularly susceptible to shear forces generated by rapid acceleration\u2013deceleration head movements. When they rupture, venous blood slowly accumulates between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater, forming a crescent-shaped collection on CT. No other vascular structure in this location explains the typical appearance and evolution of subdural hematomas.","conceptual_foundation":"Subdural hematoma is classified under traumatic intracranial hemorrhages in ICD-11. In traumatic brain injury nosology, SDH is distinguished from epidural hematoma (arterial source), subarachnoid hemorrhage (usually from aneurysmal rupture), and intracerebral hemorrhage (parenchymal). Bridging veins develop embryologically from the peri-encephalic venous plexus and mature into cortical veins draining into the superior sagittal sinus. Anatomically, they cross the subdural potential space and drain venous blood at low pressure. Movement of the brain within the skull disrupts these veins, leading to bleeding into the potential subdural space.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, bridging veins carry deoxygenated blood from the cortical surface to the dural sinuses at low venous pressure. In rapid head movement or trauma, the brain lags behind the skull, creating shearing stress along these veins. Rupture causes slow venous bleeding; intracranial pressure gradually increases, compressing the cortical surface. Compensatory cerebrospinal fluid displacement and venous outflow adjustments occur but are overwhelmed as hematoma volume grows, producing mass effect and midline shift.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute subdural hematomas typically present within 72 hours of injury. Common symptoms include headache (90%), altered mental status (50\u201380%), focal neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis (30\u201360%), and signs of raised intracranial pressure (vomiting, papilledema). In elderly or anticoagulated patients, even minor trauma can lead to large chronic or subacute subdurals with insidious onset over days to weeks, presenting with confusion, lethargy, or personality changes.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast head CT is first-line (sensitivity ~95% for acute blood). Findings: crescent-shaped hyperdensity over convexity, crossing suture lines, does not cross falx. MRI with T1 and T2 sequences can date hematoma age and detect small or isodense collections. CT angiography is not routinely indicated unless vascular injury is suspected. Pretest probability is high with history of head trauma and focal signs; CT effectively confirms or excludes SDH.","management_principles":"Management depends on hematoma size, midline shift, and clinical status. According to Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines (2016), surgical evacuation is indicated for acute SDH with thickness >10 mm or midline shift >5 mm regardless of GCS, or GCS <9 with unilateral pupil dilation. Burr-hole craniostomy or craniotomy is performed to evacuate clot. Small, asymptomatic hematomas (<10 mm, shift <5 mm, GCS \u226513) may be managed conservatively with serial imaging, head elevation, and ICP monitoring as needed.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up noncontrast CT is recommended within 24 h after surgery to assess evacuation and reaccumulation. In conservatively managed cases, repeat CT at 48\u201372 h to ensure stability. Neurological examinations should occur every 1\u20132 h initially, then spaced out as patient stabilizes. Long-term follow-up includes assessment for cognitive deficits, seizure risk, and rehabilitation planning.","clinical_pearls":"1. Subdural hematomas cross suture lines but respect dural reflections (falx). 2. Bridging vein tears are low\u2010pressure bleeds\u2014onset can be delayed (subacute/chronic). 3. In elderly or alcoholics, brain atrophy increases vein stretch risk. 4. Acute SDH with >5 mm midline shift mandates neurosurgical referral. 5. Chronic SDH may present weeks later with subtle cognitive changes.","references":"1. Bullock MR, Chesnut R, Ghajar J, et al. Surgical management of acute subdural hematomas.
