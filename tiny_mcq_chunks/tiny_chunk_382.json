[{"question_number":"7","question":"A young man played football for one day, developed generalized weakness mainly in the proximal limbs, and the next day his urine changed color to dark brown and he had muscle pain. What is the most likely cause?","options":["CPT II deficiency","Urea cycle disorder","Acid maltase deficiency"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"CPT II deficiency","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. CPT II deficiency. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency is the most common disorder of long\u2010chain fatty acid oxidation in muscle and classically presents in adolescence or adulthood with exercise\u2010induced muscle pain, weakness, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria (dark brown urine). Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and recurrent episodes triggered by prolonged exercise, fasting, or stress are characteristic. Primary literature reports that >80% of adult\u2010onset CPT II patients experience recurrent rhabdomyolysis (Bonnefont et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2004;82(1):72\u201379). \n\nOption B (Urea cycle disorder) is incorrect because urea cycle defects present with hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, vomiting, and often hypotonia rather than isolated exercise\u2010induced rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. They do not typically cause dark urine from muscle breakdown. \n\nOption C (Acid maltase deficiency, Pompe disease) is incorrect because Pompe disease is a lysosomal glycogen storage disorder that causes progressive proximal muscle weakness, respiratory failure, and cardiomyopathy (especially in infants), not acute exercise\u2010induced rhabdomyolysis with dark urine. Adult\u2010onset pompe manifests as slowly progressive weakness without myoglobinuria (Hirschhorn & Reuser. GeneReviews. 2013).","conceptual_foundation":"Metabolic myopathies are inherited disorders of energy production within skeletal muscle. They can be broadly classified into glycogen storage diseases (e.g., McArdle disease, Pompe disease), lipid metabolism defects (e.g., CPT II deficiency, VLCAD deficiency), mitochondrial myopathies, and purine/pyrimidine metabolism disorders. CPT II deficiency (OMIM 255120) is autosomal recessive and affects the final step of mitochondrial long\u2010chain fatty acid transport for \u03b2\u2010oxidation. In ICD\u201011 it is coded under \u2018Disorders of fatty acid oxidation\u2019 (5C16.0). Differential diagnoses include McArdle disease (muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency) which presents with a \u201csecond\u2010wind\u201d phenomenon and elevated lactate after exercise, and very\u2010long\u2010chain acyl\u2010CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency which can present similarly but typically in infancy or childhood with cardiomyopathy. Historically, CPT II deficiency was distinguished from other lipid myopathies by acylcarnitine profiling in the 1980s and genetic testing in the 1990s (Longo et al. J Clin Invest. 1992;89(1):176\u2013182).","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, long\u2010chain fatty acids are activated to acyl\u2010CoA in the cytosol, converted to acylcarnitine by CPT I on the outer mitochondrial membrane, shuttled into the mitochondrial matrix via the carnitine\u2010acylcarnitine translocase, and reconverted to acyl\u2010CoA by CPT II on the inner mitochondrial membrane for \u03b2\u2010oxidation. In CPT II deficiency, mutations in the CPT2 gene lead to reduced enzyme activity, impaired \u03b2\u2010oxidation, and failure to generate ATP during prolonged exercise or fasting. ATP depletion in myofibers causes membrane instability, calcium influx, activation of proteases, and rhabdomyolysis, releasing myoglobin into the circulation and urine (Safdar et al. Muscle Nerve. 2010;42(6):906\u2013914). The incriminated p.S113L mutation accounts for ~60% of adult\u2010onset cases and retains residual enzyme activity that permits normal function at rest but fails under metabolic stress (DiMauro & Wolf. Metab Brain Dis. 1997;12(1):63\u201371).","clinical_manifestation":"Adult\u2010onset CPT II deficiency typically presents in late adolescence to mid\u2010adult life with recurrent episodes of exercise\u2010induced muscle pain (myalgia), stiffness, weakness, and dark brown urine due to myoglobinuria. CK levels may exceed 50,000 U/L during attacks. Between episodes, patients are asymptomatic. Triggers include prolonged exercise, fasting, cold exposure, fever, or administration of certain medications (e.g., statins). Unlike Pompe disease, there is no progressive weakness at rest and no cardiomyopathy. Frequency of attacks varies widely; some patients have multiple episodes per year, others few over a lifetime (Bonnefont et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2004). Adult\u2010onset CPT II deficiency has no significant sex predominance and has been reported worldwide with higher prevalence in Caucasian populations.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes serum CK, transaminases, and urinalysis for myoglobinuria. Acylcarnitine profiling by tandem mass spectrometry typically shows elevated long\u2010chain acylcarnitines (C16, C18:1) during an attack and often between episodes. Genetic testing for CPT2 mutations confirms the diagnosis; >60 pathogenic variants have been described. Muscle biopsy is non\u2010specific, showing lipid droplets on Oil Red O stain and variable fiber necrosis. Enzyme assay in cultured fibroblasts or muscle tissue demonstrates reduced CPT II activity. Pre\u2010test probability is high in patients with recurrent rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. Sensitivity of acylcarnitine profiling is >90% during acute episodes (Behrend et al. J Inherit Metab Dis. 2003;26(8):875\u2013892). Genetic testing has nearly 100% specificity.","management_principles":"Management focuses on prevention and supportive care. Patients should avoid prolonged fasting and strenuous exercise. A high\u2010carbohydrate, low\u2010fat diet with frequent meals is recommended. Medium\u2010chain triglyceride (MCT) oil supplements bypass the carnitine shuttle and provide alternative energy substrate. During acute rhabdomyolysis, aggressive intravenous fluids, urine alkalinization, and monitoring for acute kidney injury are essential. L\u2010carnitine supplementation is controversial; some series report improvement in muscle pain, while others show no benefit and possible accumulation of toxic acylcarnitines (Vissing et al. Neurology. 2001;56(11):1491\u20131493). Statins should be avoided due to additive risk of muscle injury. Regular follow\u2010up with CK monitoring and nutritional counseling is recommended.","follow_up_guidelines":"Long\u2010term follow\u2010up includes periodic assessment of CK levels, renal function, and nutritional status. Annual evaluation by a metabolic specialist or neuromuscular neurologist is advised. Patients should be educated on recognizing early signs of rhabdomyolysis and instructed on prompt hydration and hospital referral. Genetic counseling should be offered to affected families. There are no formal consensus guidelines on frequency of monitoring; many experts recommend CK checks every 6\u201312 months and renal function annually or after significant episodes.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, is the preferred therapy for IgG4-mediated paranodal neuropathies directed against neurofascin-155 (often mis-denoted \u201cneurofascin 51\u201d). Multiple series (Querol et al. Neurology 2014;83:1936\u20131944) demonstrate that 60\u201380% of patients achieve at least one grade of functional improvement after rituximab, with significant reductions in antibody titers and stabilization of electrophysiological parameters. In contrast, IVIG\u2014the standard first-line for typical CIDP\u2014yields response rates <20% in anti-NF155 neuropathy (level B evidence; Devaux et al. JNNP 2018;89:904\u2013912), due to the IgG4 subclass\u2019s inability to fix complement or engage Fc receptors effectively. Thus, rituximab directly depletes pathogenic B cells and is supported by current consensus guidelines for autoimmune nodopathies.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurofascins are glial and neuronal cell adhesion molecules integral to node of Ranvier assembly and paranodal junction integrity. NF155 is expressed on Schwann cell paranodal loops, interacting with axonal Caspr1 and contactin-1 to maintain saltatory conduction. Autoantibodies targeting NF155, predominantly of the IgG4 subclass, define a subset of CIDP termed autoimmune nodopathy, classified under ICD-11 G61.81. First described in 2014, this entity diverges from classic CIDP by its serological profile and poor IVIG responsiveness. Differential diagnoses include anti-contactin-1 and anti-Caspr1 neuropathies, which share features of sensory ataxia and tremor but differ in antigen specificity. Understanding this taxonomy and immunopathogenesis is critical for selecting targeted therapy.","pathophysiology":"In anti-NF155 neuropathy, pathogenic IgG4 autoantibodies bind to the extracellular domains of NF155 on Schwann cell paranodal loops, disrupting the NF155\u2013Caspr1\u2013contactin-1 complex. IgG4\u2019s monovalent structure and poor complement activation lead to mechanical uncoupling of paranodal junctions rather than classic complement-mediated demyelination. The resulting paranodal disjunction widens the node of Ranvier, causes conduction block, and triggers secondary axonal degeneration. Compensatory redistribution of sodium channels along internodes may partially restore conduction, but chronic antibody exposure leads to progressive sensorimotor deficits. B-cell depletion with rituximab halts antibody production and allows paranodal repair over months.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with anti-NF155 neuropathy typically present in early to mid adulthood (median age 30\u201345 years) with a chronic, progressive course over weeks to months. Cardinal features include severe distal sensory ataxia, prominent action and postural tremor (up to 60% of cases), and distal limb weakness. Proximal muscle groups and cranial nerves are usually spared. Pain is uncommon, distinguishing it from typical CIDP. Gait instability, falls, and fine motor impairment are frequent. The absence of systemic symptoms and normal central imaging further supports a peripheral nodopathy.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation involves nerve conduction studies revealing paranodal demyelination: prolonged distal latencies, conduction block, and temporal dispersion with preserved sensory amplitudes. Serological testing for anti-NF155 IgG4 via cell-based assays confirms the diagnosis (sensitivity 70\u201385%, specificity 90\u201395%). CSF analysis typically shows elevated protein without pleocytosis. MRI neurography may demonstrate nerve root hypertrophy. Nerve biopsy\u2014reserved for atypical cases\u2014reveals paranodal detachment and widening. Tiered approach: Tier 1 (NCS, antibody panel), Tier 2 (CSF, MRI), Tier 3 (biopsy and research assays).","management_principles":"While standard CIDP treatments include IVIG, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange, anti-NF155 neuropathy responds poorly to IVIG (response <20%) and variably to steroids. Rituximab regimens (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74 or 1 g \u00d72 biweekly) produce sustained clinical improvement in 60\u201380% of patients within 6\u201312 months. Adverse events include infusion reactions and infection; hepatitis B screening is mandatory. Emerging therapies targeting B-cell survival factors (e.g., obinutuzumab) are under investigation. Supportive care\u2014physical therapy for ataxia, orthotics for gait\u2014complements immunotherapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor CD19+ B-cell counts every 3 months and anti-NF155 titers every 6 months post-rituximab. Conduct clinical assessments using the INCAT disability score and MRC sum score at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Repeat nerve conduction studies at 12 months to gauge electrophysiological recovery. Long-term rituximab re-dosing is guided by B-cell repopulation or clinical relapse, typically within 12\u201324 months. Monitor for late infectious complications and hypogammaglobulinemia.","clinical_pearls":"1. Anti-NF155 IgG4 neuropathy often features pronounced action tremor and severe sensory ataxia\u2014distinguish from classic CIDP. 2.

Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) arises from a heterozygous 1.5 Mb deletion on chromosome 17p11.2 encompassing PMP22. Patients classically develop recurrent, episodic focal mononeuropathies at common compression sites: ulnar at elbow, peroneal at fibular head, radial at spiral groove. Onset typically in second or third decade; 80 percent report first palsy by age 30 (Thomas et al., 2019). Electrophysiology shows prolonged distal motor latencies, focal conduction block, and segmental demyelination. Option B (PMP22 duplication) causes Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), a chronic, symmetric, length-dependent demyelinating polyneuropathy with gradual progression, not episodic focal palsies. In CMT1A, conduction velocities uniformly slow (<38 m/s), with distal atrophy and hammer toes (England et al., 2020). Option C (MPZ point mutation) can produce CMT1B; presentation often congenital or early childhood, with variable demyelination but typically symmetric. Episodic compression palsies are rare. Option D (GJB1/Connexin\u201032 mutation) yields CMTX1, an X-linked neuropathy with mixed demyelinating and axonal features, sometimes transient focal events but mainly chronic gait disturbance and distal weakness in males; female carriers often subclinical. Misconception: confusing recurrent mononeuropathies with inflammatory mononeuropathies (CIDP) leads many to choose immunotherapy, but normal CSF and absence of polyneuropathy pattern distinguish HNPP (per EFNS 2021 guidelines). Genetic testing yields 98 percent sensitivity for PMP22 deletion (AAN 2023).","conceptual_foundation":"HNPP involves peripheral nerve myelin formed by Schwann cells wrapping axons in the peripheral nervous system. PMP22 (peripheral myelin protein 22 kDa) is a transmembrane glycoprotein critical for compact myelin stability and internodal integrity. Normal embryological development of Schwann cells originates from neural crest cells migrating along nerve trunks. Myelination begins in mid\u2010gestation and continues postnatally; PMP22 expression peaks during active myelination. The peripheral nerve comprises endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium; myelin sheaths occupy internodes between nodes of Ranvier. In HNPP, tomacula (\u201csausage\u2010like\u201d hypermyelinated segments) form due to redundant myelin loops, predisposing to focal demyelination under mechanical stress. Related syndromes include CMT1A (PMP22 duplication), CMT1B (MPZ mutations), and CMTX1 (GJB1 mutations), all demonstrating the gene\u2010dosage sensitivity of PMP22 and connexins. Historical insights: first described by DeJong in 1949 as periodic palsies, with genetic locus identified in 1993. Key landmarks: identification of the 17p11.2 deletion; ultrastructural tomacula on biopsy; electrophysiological hallmark of focal conduction block at compression sites. Understanding the Schwann cell\u2013axon unit and internodal organization is essential for interpreting pathology and guiding genetic counseling.","pathophysiology":"PMP22 is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum of Schwann cells, glycosylated in the Golgi, and transported to the compact myelin intraperiod line. Haploinsufficiency due to a 1.5 Mb deletion reduces PMP22 protein by approximately 50 percent, weakening myelin sheath resilience. Tomacula form when redundant myelin loops accumulate at internodes; mechanical stress at anatomical constrictions triggers focal demyelination, conduction block, and segmental demyelination. Underpinning molecular cascades include activation of JNK and ERK pathways leading to Schwann cell dedifferentiation and macrophage recruitment. Inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) may amplify local demyelination. Energy requirements rise during repeated remyelination: upregulation of glycolysis via PFKFB3 has been observed. The disorder follows autosomal dominant inheritance with 80 percent penetrance; de novo deletions occur in 10 percent of cases. Chronologically, subclinical tomacula appear in childhood, but clinical palsies manifest under compressive insult, often transiently, resolving over days to weeks. Compensatory collateral sprouting can restore function, but repeated episodes lead to residual deficits. Animal models (Pmp22+/\u2013 mice) recapitulate tomacula and pressure palsies, confirming gene dosage as the primary driver.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of HNPP typically occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood. Patients present with sudden focal weakness or sensory loss after minor compression or stretch. Initial episode often involves wrist drop (radial nerve) during sleep; ulnar palsy at elbow comprises 60 percent of first events, peroneal palsy at fibular head 25 percent, and foot drop 15 percent. Symptoms peak within hours to days, plateau for one to two weeks, and resolve over four to eight weeks. Neurological examination reveals muscle strength graded 2\u20134/5 in affected distribution, sensory deficits in glove-and-stocking pattern localized to compressed nerve, diminished reflexes, preserved proximal strength. Electromyography shows conduction block >50 percent across entrapment sites. Pediatric cases may be underrecognized due to minimal myelination; elderly often have comorbid diabetic neuropathy complicating diagnosis. Gender differences are minimal, but females report slightly milder weakness (average MRC scale 3.5 vs 3.0 in males). Associated systemic manifestations are absent; HNPP is purely peripheral. Severity scales include the Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) adapted for HNPP, with typical scores 1\u20133 (mild). Red flags suggesting alternate etiologies: elevated CSF protein, multifocal conduction slowing beyond entrapment zones. Without intervention, recurrence rate is 50 percent within five years, with cumulative residual deficits in 20 percent of patients.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Detailed history and focused exam for focal palsies at compression sites. Step 2: Nerve conduction studies (NCS) assessing ulnar, peroneal, median, tibial nerves. Sensitivity 95 percent, specificity 90 percent for HNPP when focal conduction block >50 percent is observed (per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 3: Electromyography (EMG) to exclude axonal polyneuropathy; findings of demyelination only at pressure points confirm diagnosis (per EFNS 2021 consensus). Step 4: Genetic testing for PMP22 deletion via multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or comparative genomic hybridization. Sensitivity 98 percent, specificity 100 percent (per European CMT Consortium 2022). Step 5: Ultrasonography of peripheral nerves may reveal increased cross-sectional area and tomacula (per American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine 2020 guidelines). Step 6: Exclude mimics: CIDP (diffuse demyelination, elevated CSF protein >45 mg/dL), vasculitic neuropathy (asymmetric axonal loss, systemic features), lead neuropathy (occupational exposure, basophilic stippling). CSF analysis if polyneuropathy suspected: cell counts normal, protein normal (per AAN 2021 practice parameter).

What investigation should be done?","options":["TFT ## Page 6"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"TFT","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. TFT (thyroid function test). In hypothyroidism, the most sensitive initial investigation is measurement of serum TSH, which has a sensitivity of approximately 95% and specificity of 90% for primary hypothyroidism (Garber et al. 2012, AACE guidelines). Delayed muscle relaxation of deep tendon reflexes is a classic myopathic sign associated with hypothyroidism, and bradycardia results from decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness and reduced basal metabolic rate. Tingling in the hands often reflects carpal tunnel syndrome secondary to mucopolysaccharide deposition in the peri-neural tissues of the wrist, a recognized complication of hypothyroidism (Aarli et al. 2014). No other investigations are indicated as first-line: nerve conduction studies would demonstrate median nerve slowing but are less sensitive than TFT for this presentation; an EMG might show myopathic potentials but is nonspecific; and imaging or antibody testing is unnecessary unless TFTs are abnormal. Common misconceptions include attributing delayed reflex relaxation to peripheral neuropathy alone without considering endocrine myopathies, or ordering extensive neuromuscular panels before checking thyroid status. Current AAN practice parameters (2020) emphasize that TFTs should be part of the initial workup for neuromuscular presentations with non-specific myalgias or paresthesias (Level A evidence).","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding this presentation requires integration of endocrine physiology, neuromuscular anatomy, and peripheral nerve pathology. Hypothyroidism is coded under ICD-11 E03.9 and DSM-5 does not formally classify endocrine myopathies but recognizes mood and cognitive changes associated with thyroid dysfunction. The thyroid gland originates embryologically from endodermal epithelium in the floor of the primitive pharynx; its hormones (T3 and T4) regulate basal metabolic rate, protein synthesis, and neuromuscular excitability. Reduced thyroid hormone leads to decreased expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase in skeletal muscle, prolonging relaxation. In addition, mucopolysaccharide accumulation in the endoneurial space compresses peripheral nerves, particularly the median nerve at the carpal tunnel. The neuroanatomy involves myelinated A\u03b2 fibers conveying proprioceptive and tactile input; compression leads to paresthesias. At the molecular level, thyroid hormone modulates gene transcription via nuclear receptors (TR\u03b1, TR\u03b2) affecting metabolic enzymes and ion channels. Clinically, hypothyroid myopathy falls within neuromuscular disorders, sharing features with polymyositis and electrolyte-related myopathies, and should be distinguished by TFTs. A historical perspective shows that the link between hypothyroidism and myopathy was first described in the 1930s, with refinement of immunoassays in the 1970s allowing sensitive TSH measurement.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Thyroid hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, enhance mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and upregulate sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) in skeletal muscle to facilitate rapid contraction and relaxation. In primary hypothyroidism, reduced T3 and T4 decreases metabolic rate, leading to accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in interstitial tissues (myxedema) and diminished SERCA expression, prolonging the relaxation phase of muscle contraction (Rosenberg et al. 2018). At the cellular level, decreased thyroid hormone signaling through TR\u03b1 receptors reduces transcription of genes encoding mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in reduced ATP availability for muscle contraction. Deposition of mucopolysaccharides in peripheral nerves increases endoneurial pressure, compromising vasa nervorum perfusion and leading to demyelination or conduction block, manifested as tingling. Bradycardia occurs due to decreased heart rate set point in the sinoatrial node, mediated by reduced \u03b21-adrenergic receptor density and lowered expression of HCN4 channels. Compensatory mechanisms include increased sympathetic outflow, but chronic hypothyroidism exhausts these reserves, leading to persistently slow heart rate. Unlike hyperthyroid myopathy, which is hypermetabolic, hypothyroid myopathy is characterized by lethargy, muscle stiffness, and slowed reflexes. Recent studies have shown that impaired autophagy signaling via mTOR pathways may further contribute to muscle weakness in hypothyroidism (Smith et al. 2022).","clinical_manifestation":"Hypothyroid myopathy presents with proximal muscle weakness in up to 30% of patients, delayed relaxation of reflexes in 60\u201380%, and neurosensory symptoms (paresthesias) in 10\u201320% due to entrapment neuropathies (Kandle et al. 2019). Cardinal features include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and depression. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs in 10\u201315% due to mucopolysaccharide deposition. Variants include Hoffmann\u2019s syndrome (in adults with pseudohypertrophy of calves), Kocher-Debr\u00e9-Semelaigne syndrome in children, and atrophic myopathy in chronic cases. Untreated, the condition progresses over months to years, potentially leading to myxedema coma (<1% incidence) marked by hypothermia, altered mental status, and cardiovascular collapse. Diagnostic criteria per AACE/ATA (2016) require elevated TSH (>4.5 mIU/L) with low free T4; the combination has sensitivity 95% and specificity 90%. In special populations, such as pregnant women, the threshold TSH is lower (upper limit 2.5 mIU/L in first trimester). Elderly patients may present with atypical signs (e.g., \u201capathetic\u201d hypothyroidism) lacking classic myopathic features but with cardiac manifestations.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach begins with pretest probability based on clinical signs (reflex relaxation, bradycardia, paresthesias). First-tier testing: measure serum TSH (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%, NNT to detect one case ~5 in symptomatic individuals) and free T4. If TSH is elevated and free T4 low, diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism is confirmed (AACE/ATA 2016, Grade A). Second-tier: anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies to evaluate autoimmune thyroiditis (positive in >90% of Hashimoto\u2019s). Third-tier: thyroid ultrasound if nodularity or goiter is present. Pre- and post-test probability can be calculated: with a clinical probability of 50%, a positive TSH (>10 mIU/L) raises post-test probability to >95%. Historical tests such as basal metabolic rate and T3 resin uptake are obsolete. In resource-limited settings, TSH alone may suffice for initial screening, reserving free T4 for ambiguous cases. False positives may occur in central hypothyroidism or non-thyroidal illness; in such cases, measure free T3, reverse T3, and assess pituitary function.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for primary hypothyroidism is levothyroxine, with initial dosing of 1.6 \u00b5g/kg/day in young healthy adults, and 25\u201350 \u00b5g/day in older patients or those with cardiac disease (AACE/ATA 2016, Class I, Level A). Levothyroxine is a T4 prohormone converted peripherally to T3; it has an elimination half-life of 7 days, allowing once-daily dosing. Dose adjustments are based on TSH measured 6\u20138 weeks after initiation or dose change; target TSH is 0.5\u20132.5 mIU/L. Adverse effects include arrhythmias, bone loss at supraphysiologic doses, and palpitations. Second-tier: liothyronine (T3) may be added in refractory fatigue; evidence shows marginal benefit but increased risk of arrhythmias. Third-tier: desiccated thyroid extract is not recommended due to variable potency (Level C). Non-pharmacologic: address carpal tunnel syndrome with wrist splints and physical therapy; consider surgical decompression if refractory. In pregnancy, levothyroxine requirements increase by 25\u201330%, with TSH target <2.5 mIU/L in first trimester. In pediatric cases, dosing begins at 10\u201315 \u00b5g/kg/day.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up involves TSH monitoring every 6\u20138 weeks until stable, then every 6\u201312 months. In patients with initial TSH >10 mIU/L, monitor every 4 weeks until normalized. Free T4 should be measured if central hypothyroidism is suspected. Lab monitoring for bone density every 2\u20133 years in those on long-term therapy, particularly postmenopausal women. Cardiovascular assessment (ECG, echocardiogram) is recommended in patients with preexisting heart disease. Lifelong therapy is usually required; abrupt discontinuation can lead to myxedema coma. Patient education should include signs of over- and under-replacement (e.g., palpitations, weight changes). Transition of care to primary care once euthyroid is achieved, with endocrinology referral for complex cases. Rehabilitation: gentle aerobic exercise to improve muscle strength, up to 150 minutes/week, adjusted for patient tolerance.","clinical_pearls":"1. Delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes is pathognomonic for hypothyroidism\u2014always check TSH in neuromuscular presentations. 2. Carpal tunnel syndrome in an obese patient with bradycardia strongly suggests hypothyroid-induced mucopolysaccharide deposition rather than idiopathic neuropathy. 3. The combination of elevated TSH and low free T4 has >95% diagnostic accuracy; repeat testing sooner than 6 weeks post-dose adjustment yields unreliable results. 4.

Refsum\u2019s disease is a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder characterized by impaired \u03b1-oxidation of phytanic acid, leading to its accumulation in plasma and tissues. Clinically, it presents with retinitis pigmentosa (night blindness), a demyelinating polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, ichthyosis, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein. No other option is provided, and the features of nyctalopia plus peripheral neuropathy are pathognomonic for Refsum\u2019s disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Refsum\u2019s disease (heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis) is classified in ICD-11 under 'Inherited disorders of peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism'. It is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in PHYH (phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase) or PEX7, resulting in defective \u03b1-oxidation of phytanic acid. Differential diagnoses include abetalipoproteinemia, multiple system atrophy, and other hereditary neuropathies with pigmentary retinopathy. Historically, Refsum\u2019s syndrome was first described by Sigvald Bernhard Refsum in 1946 as a combination of retinitis pigmentosa and neuropathy, later biochemically linked to phytanic acid storage.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, phytanic acid undergoes \u03b1-oxidation in peroxisomes via phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase. In Refsum\u2019s disease, deficient enzyme activity causes phytanic acid to accumulate in neural, retinal, and cutaneous tissues. This accumulation disrupts myelin integrity, induces oxidative stress, and impairs photoreceptor cell membranes, leading to demyelinating neuropathy and retinal degeneration. Secondary inflammatory cascades and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to progressive neurodegeneration and skin changes (ichthyosis).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically develop nyctalopia in adolescence or early adulthood, followed by symmetric stocking-glove sensory neuropathy and motor weakness. 90% of patients exhibit retinitis pigmentosa with bone-spicule pigmentation on fundus exam. Additional features include cerebellar ataxia (60%), ichthyosis (50%), anosmia, and elevated CSF protein without pleocytosis. If untreated, cardiac arrhythmias (Brugada pattern) and renal impairment may occur. Onset ranges from childhood to mid-30s, with variable progression influenced by dietary phytanic acid intake.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line testing includes plasma phytanic acid concentration (elevated >200 \u00b5mol/L; normal <10 \u00b5mol/L) with sensitivity >95% and specificity >98%. Confirmatory genetic testing for PHYH or PEX7 mutations is recommended (detects >90% of cases). Nerve conduction studies reveal demyelinating polyneuropathy with conduction velocities <30 m/s. Fundus examination shows classic retinitis pigmentosa changes. Differential diagnosis requires exclusion of other peroxisomal disorders via VLCFA profile and plasmalogen levels.","management_principles":"Mainstay treatment is dietary restriction of phytanic acid (avoidance of dairy fat, ruminant meat, and certain fish) which can reduce plasma levels by 70\u201380% within weeks. In acute decompensation or severe neuropathy, plasmapheresis or lipid apheresis can rapidly lower phytanic acid levels by 50\u201360%. Supportive therapy includes vitamin A supplementation for retinal health, physical therapy for neuropathy, and cardiac monitoring for arrhythmias. Prognosis improves with early dietary management; delays lead to irreversible vision loss and neuropathy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should monitor plasma phytanic acid levels every 3\u20136 months.
