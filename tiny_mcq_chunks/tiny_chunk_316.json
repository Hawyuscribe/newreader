Limb\u2010Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B), an autosomal\u2010dominant laminopathy due to LMNA mutations, is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and cardiac involvement, with joint contractures developing late in the disease course (Quijano\u2010Roy et al. Neuromuscul Disord. 2010;20(6):386\u2013397). Elevated cardiac enzymes reflect underlying cardiomyopathy. Option A (\u201cContracture of elbow and ankle\u201d) describes the anatomical sites but omits timing and inheritance and is too nonspecific. Option C (\u201cEarly contracture in Emery\u2010Dreifuss dystrophy (X\u2010linked)\u201d) describes X\u2010linked EDMD caused by EMD mutations, in which early contractures of the elbows, Achilles, and neck occur in childhood, distinguishing it from LGMD1B. Option D is incorrect because a specific contracture pattern and timing are established in LGMD1B.","conceptual_foundation":"Laminopathies result from pathogenic variants in nuclear envelope proteins; LMNA encodes lamins A/C. LGMD1B (ICD-11: 8C83.10) is distinct from X-linked EDMD (ICD-11: 8C83.0E). Differential diagnoses include other autosomal-dominant LGMD (e.g., LGMD1A, 1C) and congenital contracture syndromes (e.g., Freeman\u2013Sheldon syndrome). Historically, Emery and Dreifuss first described X-linked EDMD in 1966; LMNA-related muscular dystrophies were characterized in 1999 (Bonne et al. Nat Genet. 1999;21(3):285\u2013288). Embryologically, lamins are type V intermediate filament proteins crucial for nuclear structure across mesodermal\u2013derived tissues. Neuromuscular phenotype arises from selective vulnerability of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers to nuclear envelope instability.","pathophysiology":"Normal nuclear lamins provide structural support and regulate chromatin organization. LMNA mutations produce defective lamins A/C, leading to nuclear membrane fragility, altered gene expression, and impaired mechanical stress response. In skeletal muscle, cumulative mechanical stress causes myofiber necrosis and fibro\u2010fatty replacement. In the heart, conduction tissue is disrupted, leading to arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy. Progressive fibrosis of periarticular soft tissues leads to late joint contractures. Cellular studies show upregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and fibrosis markers (Worman HJ. J Clin Invest. 2012;122(7):2389\u20132398).","clinical_manifestation":"LGMD1B typically presents in the third to fifth decades with slowly progressive proximal pelvic and shoulder girdle weakness, elevated creatine kinase (1,000\u20135,000 IU/L), and conduction defects (sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block). Cardiac enzyme elevations (troponin I/T, CK-MB) may reflect ongoing myocardial injury. Joint contractures of the elbows, ankles, and neck develop late, often after years of muscle weakness. Natural history studies report median age at wheelchair dependence of 50 years and high risk of sudden cardiac death without device therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Serum CK (elevated), ECG (conduction abnormalities), echocardiography (dilated cardiomyopathy), EMG (myopathic potentials). Second\u2010tier: Muscle MRI showing selective fatty infiltration of posterior thigh and gluteal muscles. Third\u2010tier: Genetic testing with LMNA gene sequencing (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~100%). Pretest probability is high in adults with proximal weakness plus cardiac involvement. Genetic counseling is recommended for family screening.","management_principles":"No curative therapy exists.

Physiotherapy and range\u2010of\u2010motion exercises delay contracture progression. Standard heart failure therapies (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers) apply to dilated cardiomyopathy. Orthotic devices may improve joint mobility.","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual neurologic assessment of strength and mobility.

What is the management?","options":["IV IG","Prednisolone","Plasma exchange","None of the above"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"IV IG","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. IV IG. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a first-line immunotherapy for Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that a 2 g/kg course of IVIG over 5 days is at least as effective as plasma exchange (PLEX) in accelerating recovery and improving functional outcomes. Hughes et al. (2014) reported that patients treated with IVIG regained independent walking (GBS disability score \u22642) at a median of 4 weeks compared to 6 weeks in untreated controls (hazard ratio 1.8; 95% CI 1.4\u20132.2; Level A evidence). IVIG is generally preferred due to ease of administration, fewer vascular access complications, and comparable efficacy.  \n\nOption B (Prednisolone): High\u2010dose corticosteroids alone have been shown in multiple trials to be ineffective in GBS; the Cochrane review (Hughes et al., 2009) found no benefit of oral or intravenous steroids on time to walking or long-term disability and even potential harm (relative risk of no improvement 1.1; 95% CI 0.9\u20131.3).  \n\nOption C (Plasma exchange): PLEX is also a first\u2010line therapy for GBS and has level A evidence (Brown et al., 1988; American Academy of Neurology 2010 practice parameter) showing reduced time to unaided walking by a median of 3 weeks vs. supportive care (p<0.001). However, between IVIG and PLEX, no statistically significant difference in efficacy has been shown (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.85\u20131.25), and IVIG is often chosen for logistical reasons.  \n\nOption D (None of the above): This is incorrect as both IVIG and PLEX are proven therapies for GBS and should be instituted early in the disease course.","conceptual_foundation":"Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is an acute, immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy characterized by rapidly progressive, symmetric limb weakness and areflexia. Under ICD-11 classification, GBS falls under 8A40 \u2018Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy\u2019. It is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide with an incidence of 1\u20132 per 100,000 per year. Historical descriptions date back to Landry (1859), with the classic AIDP variant described by Guillain, Barr\u00e9, and Strohl in 1916. Related conditions include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and Miller Fisher syndrome; differentiation rests on time course (>8 weeks in CIDP), antibody profile (anti\u2010GQ1b in Miller Fisher), and clinical features (ophthalmoplegia, ataxia). Embryologically, peripheral nerves derive from neural crest cells with Schwann cells of ectodermal origin; the pathology targets the Schwann cell-axon unit. Neuroanatomically, the demyelination affects spinal nerve roots and peripheral nerves; major afferent and efferent fibers in motor roots lead to symmetric weakness, while sensory fibers produce dysesthesias. Autonomic fibers can be involved, leading to dysautonomia such as facial hyperhidrosis. The blood\u2013nerve barrier at the nerve root level is particularly susceptible to immune attack. Molecularly, both humoral (anti-myelin antibodies, complement activation) and cellular (CD4+ and CD8+ T cell\u2013mediated) mechanisms contribute, with genetic predispositions in HLA\u2010DR and ganglioside mimicry from antecedent infections (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni) playing roles.","pathophysiology":"Normal peripheral nerve conduction relies on intact myelin sheaths produced by Schwann cells, which enable saltatory conduction. In GBS, molecular mimicry between microbial antigens (e.g., C. jejuni lipo-oligosaccharide structures) and peripheral nerve glycolipids (GM1, GD1a) triggers cross-reactive antibodies that activate complement, leading to macrophage-mediated demyelination at the nodes of Ranvier. Complement deposition (C3b) and membrane attack complex formation cause Schwann cell injury and segmental demyelination. In axonal variants (AMAN, AMSAN), direct antibody-mediated axonal damage occurs. The endoneurial inflammatory response disrupts nerve conduction, resulting in conduction block, temporal dispersion, and increased distal latencies on nerve conduction studies. Autonomic fibers are also affected, causing dysautonomia such as tachycardia, blood pressure fluctuations, and diaphoresis. The temporal course begins with acute immune activation (days), myelin breakdown (weeks), and, if remyelination is successful, recovery over months. Chronic or severe damage may lead to Wallerian degeneration, requiring axonal regeneration at ~1 mm/day.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with GBS typically present with symmetric, ascending weakness starting in the legs and progressing to arms and bulbar muscles over days to weeks. Distal paresthesias often precede weakness. Diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes are characteristic. Autonomic dysfunction occurs in up to 70% of cases, manifesting as labile hypertension, tachycardia, urinary retention, and diaphoresis such as facial hyperhidrosis. Pain (muscle aches, neuropathic) is reported in 50%. Cranial nerve involvement (facial diplegia, ocular motility deficits) occurs in 50%. Respiratory failure develops in ~25%, necessitating mechanical ventilation. Variants include Miller Fisher syndrome (ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia), pure motor GBS, and axonal subtypes; Miller Fisher is associated with anti\u2010GQ1b antibodies in >90%. Prognosis varies: ~80% achieve independent walking at 6 months; mortality is ~4\u20137%, often from respiratory or autonomic complications.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by electrophysiological studies and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The Brighton criteria (levels 1\u20134) stratify diagnostic certainty based on clinical features, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation (protein >45 mg/dL with <10 cells/mm\u00b3; sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90% after week 1), and nerve conduction studies (reduced conduction velocity, prolonged distal latencies, conduction block). Nerve conduction studies have sensitivity 75% in the first week and >90% thereafter. First-tier tests include baseline CBC, electrolytes, and CSF to rule out mimics. Second-tier: serial nerve conduction and F-wave studies. Third-tier: antiganglioside antibody testing (anti\u2010GM1, anti\u2010GD1a) in axonal variants. Pre-test probability is high in acute flaccid paralysis with areflexia and supportive antecedent history. MRI of spine may show nerve root enhancement but is not routinely required.","management_principles":"Supportive care in an ICU setting is paramount, with monitoring of vital capacity, autonomic function, and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Immunotherapy with either IVIG (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days) or PLEX (4\u20136 exchanges over 8\u201310 days) should be initiated within 2 weeks of onset (AAN Class I evidence). IVIG has a favorable safety profile compared to PLEX. Corticosteroids alone are ineffective and not recommended. Additional measures include pain control (gabapentinoids), physiotherapy, and nutritional support. Mechanical ventilation is required when vital capacity <15 mL/kg or rapid progression. Refractory cases may benefit from retreatment with IVIG or PLEX; complement inhibitors (eculizumab) are under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require frequent monitoring of respiratory function (every 4\u20136 hours) until stable. After discharge, follow-up visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months should assess muscle strength, sensory deficits, autonomic function, fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), and functional status (GBS Disability Scale). Electrodiagnostic studies may be repeated at 3\u20136 months to evaluate remyelination. Long-term follow-up includes monitoring for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) evolution in ~3% of patients. Psychological support is recommended due to risk of depression and PTSD.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early immunotherapy within 2 weeks of onset (IVIG or PLEX) significantly improves outcome; delays >4 weeks reduce benefit. 2. Prednisone monotherapy is ineffective and may prolong recovery. 3. Respiratory function (FVC) drop below 20 mL/kg signals impending respiratory failure\u2014prepare for intubation. 4. Autonomic involvement (labile BP, arrhythmias) occurs in 70%\u2014continuous cardiac monitoring is essential. 5.

Adult familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, accounting for approximately 10% of all ALS cases. Mutations in genes such as SOD1, C9orf72, FUS, and TARDBP follow autosomal dominant transmission with variable penetrance. Option B is incorrect because juvenile forms of familial ALS, while often autosomal recessive or X-linked, are distinct from adult-onset familial ALS. Option C is incorrect for adult familial ALS; autosomal recessive inheritance predominates in certain juvenile-onset forms rather than adult-onset disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Familial ALS refers to ALS with a clear inheritance pattern, representing about 5\u201310% of all ALS cases. ICD-11 classifies ALS under G12.2 (Motor neuron disease). Adult familial ALS is genetically heterogeneous, with >30 implicated genes. The most common mutation in Western populations is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 (40% of familial cases), followed by SOD1 (20%), FUS, and TARDBP. Juvenile-onset ALS often involves ALS2 (alsin) gene mutations and is autosomal recessive. Understanding inheritance patterns is essential for genetic counseling and risk assessment.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor neuron function depends on protein homeostasis, RNA processing, and axonal transport. Mutant SOD1 aggregates, C9orf72 repeat expansions produce dipeptide repeat proteins, and TDP-43 mislocalization lead to neuronal toxicity. In autosomal dominant familial ALS, a single mutated allele exerts a toxic gain-of-function, causing progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Cellular pathways implicated include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity via glutamate, impaired autophagy, and neuroinflammation with microglial activation.","clinical_manifestation":"Adult familial ALS presents similarly to sporadic ALS, with mean age of onset around 50\u201360 years. Initial symptoms include asymmetric limb weakness, fasciculations, spasticity, and dysarthria. Disease progression leads to respiratory muscle involvement, with median survival of 3\u20135 years. Familial cases may have earlier onset and faster progression. Cognitive and behavioral changes can occur, particularly in C9orf72 mutation carriers, overlapping with frontotemporal dementia (FTD).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by electromyography (EMG) demonstrating widespread denervation and reinnervation. Revised El Escorial criteria require upper and lower motor neuron signs in multiple regions. Genetic testing is recommended for patients with a family history; multi-gene panels include C9orf72, SOD1, FUS, and TARDBP. Sensitivity of EMG in ALS is >80%, specificity >90%. Pretest probability in familial cases is high; a positive genetic test confirms the molecular diagnosis.","management_principles":"Management is multidisciplinary. Riluzole, a glutamate release inhibitor, prolongs survival by ~2\u20133 months (Level A evidence, AAN 2018). Edaravone may slow functional decline in early disease (Class II evidence). Symptomatic treatments include antispasticity agents (baclofen), anticholinergics for sialorrhea, noninvasive ventilation for respiratory failure, and nutritional support via gastrostomy. Genetic counseling is essential for family members.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits are recommended every 2\u20133 months. Monitor forced vital capacity (FVC) quarterly.
