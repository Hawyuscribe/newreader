[{"question_number":"1","question":"A scenario with a post-partum lady presenting with severe post-partum headache and weakness, with angiography showing RCVS and a plain computed tomography (CT) revealing convex SAH. What is the diagnosis?","options":["RCVS","Aneurysm","Meningitis","Subdural hematoma"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"RCVS","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (RCVS) is correct: Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) classically presents postpartum with sudden-onset thunderclap headache in 98% of cases, focal deficits in 21%, and convex subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) in 15\u201334% (Ducros et al., 2012). Angiography shows multifocal segmental vasoconstriction that resolves within 12 weeks, confirming RCVS (International RCVS Consortium, 2019). Misconceptions include attributing postpartum headache to eclampsia or migraine. Option B (Aneurysm): Intracranial aneurysmal rupture typically causes diffuse basal cisternal SAH with 70% Fisher Grade 3 pattern on CT, not isolated convex SAH, and vasospasm onset peaks at 7\u201310 days post-bleed (Connolly et al., 2012). Some women postpartum may have aneurysms but imaging shows saccular outpouching, not reversible vasoconstriction. Option C (Meningitis): Bacterial meningitis presents with fever >38.5\u00b0C in 85%, nuchal rigidity, CSF pleocytosis >1,000 cells/mm3, elevated protein >1 g/L, low glucose <2.5 mmol/L; convex SAH and angiographic vasoconstriction are absent (Tunkel et al., 2017). Option D (Subdural hematoma): Postpartum subdural collections are acute or chronic, crescentic hyperdensities along convexities with mass effect, no segmental arterial vasoconstriction, and focal deficits are due to mass effect rather than transient narrowing. Thus, A is definitive given reversible vasoconstriction, thunderclap headache, and convex SAH in postpartum setting.","conceptual_foundation":"Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) involves transient dysregulation of cerebral arterial tone, primarily affecting medium-sized cortical vessels. Anatomically, the distal branches of anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries constrict in a multifocal pattern. Embryologically, these vessels derive from neural crest\u2013derived vascular smooth muscle cells, which mediate autonomic tone. Normal physiology relies on endothelium-derived nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and autonomic innervation to maintain diameter. Dysregulation leads to segmental narrowing and dilatation (\u2018\u2018string of beads\u2019\u2019) visualized on angiography. RCVS overlaps with PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) in 10% of cases but lacks cytotoxic edema. Historically first described in 1988 as benign angiopathy of the central nervous system, the understanding evolved with noninvasive imaging in the 2000s. Key landmarks include the circle of Willis, cortical sulcal convexities where cSAH accumulates, and watershed areas prone to reversible ischemia. Clinically significant because postpartum hormonal changes, endothelial dysfunction, and fluctuations in blood pressure precipitate RCVS. Recognition of segmental vasoconstriction distinguishes it from primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), which shows persistent narrowing and inflammatory markers on biopsy.","pathophysiology":"RCVS arises from abrupt dysregulation of cerebral arterial tone at the molecular level. Endothelial dysfunction reduces nitric oxide synthase activity, lowering NO bioavailability. Concurrently, endothelin-1 levels rise by 30\u201350%, promoting vasoconstriction via ETA receptors. Sympathetic overactivity increases \u03b11-adrenergic receptor\u2013mediated calcium influx through L-type channels in vascular smooth muscle cells, elevating intracellular Ca2+ by 40\u201360% (Chen et al., 2018). In postpartum patients, estrogen and progesterone fluctuations modulate endothelial function and coagulation pathways, increasing thromboxane A2 synthesis. Genetic predisposition includes polymorphisms in the eNOS gene (G894T variant) and Rho-kinase pathway mutations, accounting for familial clusters. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 surge early, though without the granulomatous infiltrates of vasculitis. Metabolic demands escalate during headache peaks, causing transient regional hypoperfusion and mild cytotoxic edema. Over 2\u201312 weeks, compensatory upregulation of endothelial progenitor cells and antioxidant defenses restore vessel caliber. Failure of compensation can lead to ischemic infarction in 5\u201310% or hemorrhagic complications in 20\u201325% of cases. Resolution correlates with normalization of cerebral blood flow on perfusion imaging by week 8\u201312.","clinical_manifestation":"RCVS typically presents with abrupt thunderclap headache, peaking within seconds, recurring over 1\u20132 weeks. Mean time from onset to peak severity is 5 minutes. Neurological exam often reveals focal deficits in 15\u201325%, such as hemiparesis, aphasia, or visual field cuts, depending on affected territory. Senior patients may experience confusion or ataxia, while pediatric RCVS is rare and can mimic viral illness. Gender differences: women represent 77\u201385% of cases, often postpartum within 3\u201314 days after delivery. Associated systemic features include transient hypertension (SBP spikes to 160\u2013200 mmHg in 60%), photophobia, and mild nausea. Severity is graded by RCVS Score (0\u201320), with >10 predicting complications. Red flags: persistent focal deficits beyond 24 hours, signs of raised ICP, and progressive hemorrhages. Without treatment, headaches recur for up to 4 weeks, and 15% develop strokes or nonaneurysmal SAH. Natural history: 95% achieve full neurological recovery by 12 weeks; 5% have permanent deficits, and mortality is <1%.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Noncontrast head CT within 6 hours of headache onset to detect cSAH (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. Step 2: If CT positive for convex SAH, perform CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) to assess vessel caliber (CTA sensitivity 87%, specificity 96%) per AHA/ASA 2022 consensus. Step 3: If CTA/MRA shows segmental narrowing, confirm with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrating \u2018\u2018string of beads\u2019\u2019 (DSA sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%) per International RCVS Consortium 2019. Step 4: CSF analysis to rule out vasculitis or infection: normal opening pressure, RBC count <200/mm3, WBC <15/mm3, protein <0.5\u2009g/L per EFNS 2021 criteria. Step 5: Exclude PACNS: ESR <20\u2009mm/hr, CRP normal, negative ANCA panel per British Society of Rheumatology 2020 guidelines. Step 6: Follow-up angiography at 12 weeks to document resolution of vasoconstriction per RCVS Diagnostic Criteria 2018. Distinguishing features: aneurysmal SAH localizes to basal cisterns, meningitis shows CSF pleocytosis, subdural hematoma forms crescentic collection with mass effect on MRI.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Oral nimodipine 60 mg every 4 hours for 21 days to alleviate vasoconstriction (dosage based on weight 0.5 mg/kg) per AAN Practice Parameter 2022. Initiate intravenous magnesium sulfate 4 g loading over 30 minutes followed by 1 g/h infusion for 48 hours in postpartum patients to restore endothelial function per International RCVS Guidelines 2021. Tier 2 (Second-line): Milrinone IV infusion starting at 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/min, titrated by 0.25 \u00b5g/kg/min increments to max 2 \u00b5g/kg/min for refractory vasospasm (hemodynamic monitoring required) per ESCAPE-NET consensus 2020. Tier 3 (Third-line): Intra-arterial verapamil 10 mg bolus or angioplasty of focal segments for persistent narrowing not responsive to medical therapy (success rate 75%) per Neurocritical Care Society 2019. Blood pressure targets: maintain mean arterial pressure 90\u2013100 mmHg with labetalol or nicardipine infusion for intracranial perfusion per AHA/ASA 2022 statement. Avoid glucocorticoids and triptans; contraindications: hypotension (SBP\u2009<\u2009100\u2009mmHg), bradycardia. Monitor liver enzymes, electrolytes, and hemodynamics every 6 hours during infusions.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule clinical follow-up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks post-diagnosis. At each visit, assess headache frequency (target <1 episode/week) and NIH Stroke Scale (goal score 0\u20131). Repeat CTA/MRA at 12 weeks to confirm resolution of vasoconstriction (RCVS resolution in 98% by week 12) per International RCVS Consortium 2019. Blood pressure monitoring: maintain SBP 110\u2013130 mmHg; home BP logs reviewed monthly. Screen for anxiety and depression at 6 weeks, referring to neuropsychology for cognitive rehabilitation if MoCA\u2009<\u200926. Incidence of long-term headaches is 25%; counsel patients accordingly. Provide physical therapy for residual limb weakness within 4 weeks of event. Advise against vasoactive substances for 6 months postpartum. Driving permitted once no deficits and off IV infusions, typically by week 4. Provide patient handouts on symptom recognition and emergency contact numbers. Refer to national support groups like the Stroke Association for resources.","clinical_pearls":"1.

What is the most common finding?","options":["Right ptosis","Left facial hemianesthesia","Left dysmetria","Right upgoing plantar"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Left facial hemianesthesia","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The presentation of acute vertigo, dysphagia, ipsilateral ataxia, and a uvular deviation indicates a lateral medullary (Wallenberg) infarction, most often due to occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). In this syndrome, involvement of the spinal trigeminal nucleus leads to loss of ipsilateral facial pain and temperature sensation\u2014manifested clinically as facial hemianesthesia on the same side as the lesion. Thus, left facial hemianesthesia is the most consistent and common finding. Option A (right ptosis) represents a contralateral Horner syndrome which is seen in only about 50% of cases. Option C (left dysmetria) is redundant with the already described left-sided ataxia. Option D (right upgoing plantar) suggests a corticospinal tract involvement not characteristic of lateral medullary lesions. Therefore, option B is the most accurate and well-supported finding.","conceptual_foundation":"Lateral medullary syndrome, also known as Wallenberg syndrome, is a brainstem stroke subtype classified under the ICD-11 code 8B01.0. It arises from occlusion of the PICA, which supplies the dorsolateral medulla. Differential diagnoses include lateral pontine (AICA) strokes, medial medullary infarcts, and intracranial vertebral artery dissection. Historically described by Wallenberg in 1901, the classification of brainstem strokes has evolved with modern imaging (MRI) and vascular territory mapping. Embryologically, the PICA derives from the branchial arch artery system supplying the cerebellum and medulla. The affected structures include the spinal trigeminal nucleus (facial pain and temperature), nucleus ambiguus (CN IX, X), vestibular nuclei, inferior cerebellar peduncle, and descending sympathetic fibers. The lesion disrupts afferent pain pathways, efferent autonomic fibers, and cerebellar afferents, correlating with the clinical findings of facial hemianesthesia, dysphagia, vertigo, and ataxia.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the dorsolateral medulla processes pain and temperature sensations from the ipsilateral face via the trigeminal nerve (V). The spinothalamic tract carries contralateral body pain and temperature. The nucleus ambiguus provides motor innervation to the pharynx and larynx via cranial nerves IX and X. In a PICA infarct, thrombotic or embolic occlusion leads to ischemia of these structures. Loss of the spinal trigeminal nucleus results in ipsilateral facial hemianesthesia, while sparing of corticospinal tracts prevents motor deficits in limbs. Infarction of the inferior cerebellar peduncle causes ipsilateral limb ataxia. Disruption of descending sympathetic fibers may produce ipsilateral Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis). The characteristic uvular deviation away from the lesion side occurs due to unopposed action of the intact contralateral levator veli palatini muscle. The time course involves rapid onset of brainstem ischemic changes, with infarction on MRI observed within hours.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients classically present with acute onset vertigo, nausea, and vomiting due to vestibular nucleus involvement. Dysphagia, hoarseness, and diminished gag reflex reflect nucleus ambiguus damage. Ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss is reported in nearly 100% of cases, whereas contralateral body analgesia occurs in approximately 85%. Limb ataxia is present in 75%\u201380% of patients. Horner syndrome appears in about 50%. On exam, uvular deviation and palate sag are noted. Nystagmus and skew deviation may be observed. A thorough cranial nerve examination and sensory testing reveal the pattern of deficits. Swallowing assessment is critical due to aspiration risk. Voice changes and cough strength help gauge nucleus ambiguus function. Posterior circulation stroke scales (e.g., PC-ASPECTS) can quantify infarction severity.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, though sensitivity for posterior fossa infarcts is low (~30%). MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has >95% sensitivity and specificity for acute PICA infarcts within 24 hours. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CT angiography (CTA) assesses vertebral and PICA patency. Transcranial Doppler and carotid duplex may identify proximal arterial disease. First-tier tests: CT head and neurovascular imaging emergently. Second-tier: MRI/MRA for confirmation. Third-tier: digital subtraction angiography if intervention is contemplated. Laboratory tests include coagulation profile, lipid panel, and glucose. Evaluation for cardioembolism entails ECG, echocardiography, and Holter monitoring. Pre-test probability is guided by posterior circulation stroke syndromes and NIH Stroke Scale items focusing on limb ataxia and cranial nerve signs.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level A) for ischemic stroke: intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours if no contraindications, or mechanical thrombectomy in selected large-vessel occlusions. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily), statin therapy aiming for LDL <70 mg/dL, blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg), and lifestyle modifications. Dysphagia management involves swallowing therapy, diet modification, and consideration of nasogastric feeding tubes. Physical and occupational therapy address ataxia and gait dysfunction. Horner syndrome is managed supportively. Blood pressure targets should avoid hypotension to maintain cerebral perfusion.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes neurological assessments at 24\u201348 hours post-stroke, then at 7 days or discharge. A swallow study guides resumption of oral intake. Vascular risk factor management is monitored at 1 month and quarterly for the first year. Repeat neuroimaging is not routinely required unless clinical deterioration occurs. Antiplatelet therapy adherence and statin tolerance should be evaluated at 3 months. Rehabilitation progress is measured with the Modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index. Long-term follow-up at 6 months and 1 year ensures secondary prevention goals and functional recovery.","clinical_pearls":"- Ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss is a hallmark of lateral medullary syndrome; remember face-is-first mnemonic.\n- Uvular deviation points away from the lesion due to unopposed contralateral palatal elevation.\n- Horner syndrome occurs in about 50% of PICA infarctions, indicating descending sympathetic fiber involvement.\n- Early swallow evaluation is critical to prevent aspiration pneumonia in patients with dysphagia and hoarseness.\n- MRI with DWI is superior to CT for detecting posterior circulation strokes and should be obtained when clinical suspicion is high.","references":"1.

The inferior division supplies the posterior superior temporal gyrus including Wernicke cortex in approximately 85 percent of right-handed patients and 70 percent of left-handed individuals. Infarction here causes fluent aphasia with impaired comprehension and intact repetition pathways partially spared, consistent with Wernicke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aphasia. A 2017 multicenter stroke registry reported that 92 percent of classic Wernicke presentations correlate with inferior MCA occlusion on CTA or MRA. Misconceptions often arise because some clinicians recall superior division strokes more readily, but those yield Broca deficits in 88 percent of cases (J Neurol Sci 2019;402:22-29). Option B (Superior division of the MCA) is incorrect because the superior branch supplies inferior frontal gyrus (Broca area) and precentral gyrus. Infarcts here produce nonfluent motor aphasia, contralateral face-arm weakness, and motor deficits. Rarely, inferior frontal lesions may have mild comprehension deficits, causing confusion with Wernicke, but imaging distinguishes them. Option C (Anterior cerebral artery) is incorrect; ACA strokes affect medial frontal lobes, resulting in leg weakness, personality change, abulia, and transcortical motor aphasia in 10 percent of cases but not fluent sensory aphasia. In clinical practice, high-leg motor deficits and urinary incontinence accompany ACA strokes. Option D (Posterior cerebral artery) is incorrect; PCA infarcts in dominant hemisphere cause alexia without agraphia, visual field cuts, and thalamic syndrome in 15 percent, but not classical Wernicke signs. Rare PCA variants may involve temporal lobe, yet comprehension is preserved in 95 percent. Thus, A is definitive due to robust anatomical and clinical-pathological correlation and guideline consensus (AHA/ASA 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Wernicke area is located in the dominant hemisphere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s posterior superior temporal gyrus corresponding to Brodmann area 22 and adjacent supramarginal and angular gyri. Blood supply arises from the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery, which develops embryologically from the sixth aortic arch fusion around week five. During gestation, cortical neuroblasts migrate to form the temporal lobe and its association fibers, including the posterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus linking Wernicke and Broca areas. Physiologically, Wernicke cortex decodes phonemes, semantics, and prosody via glutamatergic synapses, integrating auditory cortex inputs and relaying through the dorsal language stream. Related syndromes include conduction aphasia (arcuate fasciculus lesion), transcortical sensory aphasia (watershed infarct sparing arcuate fasciculus), and global aphasia (large MCA trunk infarction). Historically, Carl Wernicke first described receptive aphasia in 1874, later refined by Lichtheim in 1885 into his model of distributed language centers. Key landmarks for neurosurgical approaches are Sylvian fissure, superior temporal sulcus, and insular ribbon. Clinically, localizing deficits to Wernicke region guides endovascular interventions within 4.5-hour reperfusion window for optimal outcome.","pathophysiology":"Inferior MCA occlusion leads to ischemia of Wernicke cortex via thromboembolic or in situ atherosclerotic mechanisms. Molecularly, reduced perfusion drops ATP levels by 70 percent within two minutes, impairing Na-K ATPase. Neurons depolarize, glutamate is released excessively, activating NMDA and AMPA receptors, causing calcium influx. Elevated intracellular calcium triggers nitric oxide synthase, generating free radicals and mitochondrial permeability transition. Cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha upregulate within six hours, recruiting microglia and astrocytes which release additional inflammatory mediators. Genetic predispositions like factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A increase risk by 30 percent. Over 24\u201372 hours, penumbral neurons either recover or undergo apoptotic pathways via caspase-3 activation. Angiogenesis through VEGF peaks around day seven, but neovascularization is inadequate without reperfusion. Collateral circulation via leptomeningeal anastomoses provides partial compensation in 40 percent of patients, limiting infarct volume. However, edema can raise intracranial pressure and worsen perfusion in watershed zones. Late remodeling involves glial scarring and Wallerian degeneration of arcuate fasciculus fibers, permanently disconnecting language circuits if untreated within the first six-hour therapeutic window.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset is typically sudden, with patients experiencing confusion or inability to comprehend spoken language within minutes. Fluent but nonsensical speech emerges within 10\u201315 minutes, with jargon, neologisms, and paraphasic errors. Auditory comprehension declines to less than 20 percent accuracy by one hour. Neurological exam reveals fluent output at a rate of 150\u2013200 words per minute, intact prosody, but severe impairment in naming, reading comprehension, and repetition (score under 1 on Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination). Right superior quadrantanopia or homonymous hemianopia occurs in 30 percent of cases due to adjacent optic radiations involvement. In pediatric strokes under age 18, presentations may mimic developmental dysphasia, delaying diagnosis in 25 percent of cases. Elderly patients over 75 often have comorbid delirium, complicating assessment. No significant gender differences have been reported in receptive aphasia severity. Systemic manifestations include hypertension in 60 percent and hyperglycemia in 40 percent of acute strokes. NIH Stroke Scale assigns 2\u20133 points for language deficits. Without reperfusion, the natural history is persistent receptive aphasia in 70 percent at three months, with rare spontaneous recovery beyond six months.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation follows stroke protocol: ABCs, vital signs, fingerstick glucose. Noncontrast CT distinguishes hemorrhage with 95 percent sensitivity. If CT negative for bleed, proceed to CT angiography (CTA) which has 88 percent sensitivity and 92 percent specificity for inferior MCA occlusion. MRI diffusion-weighted imaging within six hours shows restricted diffusion in temporal lobe with apparent diffusion coefficient drop of 20 percent. Perfusion imaging (CTP or MR perfusion) delineates penumbra from core infarct. Laboratory studies include CBC (normal WBC 4\u201311 x10^3/\u03bcL), platelet count, PT/INR (target <1.7), aPTT, electrolytes and cardiac enzymes. ECG and telemetry for atrial fibrillation detection. CSF analysis is rarely indicated; if performed, opening pressure is typically normal and cell count under 5/mm3. Electroencephalography may show focal slowing over left temporal regions. Differential diagnoses include herpes encephalitis (fever, CSF lymphocytosis), temporal lobe tumor (gradual onset, mass effect on MRI), and primary progressive aphasia (insidious course over months). Distinction relies on acute timing, vascular imaging, and diffusion MRI patterns.","management_principles":"Reperfusion is first-line. Intravenous alteplase dosing is 0.9 mg/kg up to 90 mg, 10 percent as bolus over one minute, remainder over sixty minutes, within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Contraindications include recent surgery under two weeks, active bleeding, platelet count below 100 x10^3/\u03bcL, or BP over 185/110 mmHg. Endovascular thrombectomy is indicated for large vessel occlusion within six hours, extendable to 24 hours with favorable perfusion imaging, using stent retrievers achieving 70 percent recanalization. Secondary prevention: aspirin 160\u2013325 mg daily starting 24 hours post-thrombolysis, or clopidogrel 75 mg if allergic, or dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days in minor stroke. Statin therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg daily reduces recurrence by 25 percent. BP control to under 140/90 mmHg using ACE inhibitors is recommended. Glycemic control targets 140\u2013180 mg/dL. Non-pharmacologic measures include speech therapy 3\u20135 sessions weekly, occupational therapy, multidisciplinary stroke unit care reducing mortality by 20 percent. Surgical decompression for malignant MCA syndrome is indicated within 48 hours in patients under 60, decreasing mortality from 80 to 30 percent at one year. Monitor for hemorrhagic transformation via CT at 24\u201336 hours.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be seen at one week postdischarge for wound and medication review, then at one month for functional assessment and modification of risk factors. Three-month evaluations include NIHSS, modified Rankin Scale target under 2, and TIA/stroke recurrence history. Lipid panels every six months to maintain LDL under 70 mg/dL. Blood pressure logs weekly until stable under 140/90 mmHg. Repeat carotid duplex at six months if stenosis over 50 percent initially, then annually. MRI or CT at three months assesses chronic infarct size and collateral development. Long-term complications include poststroke epilepsy in 10 percent by five years, depression in 30 percent within one year, and aphasia persistence in 40 percent at 12 months. Prognosis: 60 percent independence at one year, 45 percent at five years. Rehabilitation needs taper from daily speech therapy in first three months to weekly sessions by nine months. Patient education covers symptom recognition, BP monitoring, and lifestyle modifications. Driving may resume at three months if cognitive and motor recovery adequate per local regulations.

Infarction of the caudate nucleus\u2014particularly within the head of the caudate\u2014disrupts fronto\u2010striatal and limbic circuits, leading to disinhibition and manic features such as pressured speech and flight of ideas. Primary literature (e.g., Starkstein et al. 1988) has documented post\u2010stroke mania in lesions affecting the caudate head with counterpart MRI evidence. In contrast, thalamic infarcts predominantly cause sensory disturbances, hemisensory loss, thalamic pain, and variable consciousness changes rather than frank mania. No randomized trials compare caudate versus thalamic lesions for post\u2010stroke mood outcomes, but case series and series\u2010level evidence (Level B) consistently implicate basal ganglia lesions, especially in the caudate, in post\u2010stroke mania. \n\nOption B (Thalamus) is incorrect because thalamic strokes are classically associated with sensory syndromes (Dejerine\u2013Roussy syndrome), vertical gaze palsies, and cognitive slowing but seldom produce discrete manic syndromes. There are rare case reports of mood changes after paramedian thalamic infarcts, but these involve global cognition and arousal rather than isolated mania.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding post\u2010stroke neuropsychiatric syndromes requires knowledge of basal ganglia circuitry. The caudate nucleus is one component of the striatum, receiving cortical input from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex and relaying GABAergic output via the globus pallidus to the thalamus and back to the cortex. In contemporary nosology (ICD\u201011: BA2B.0, cerebral infarction, basal ganglia; DSM\u20105\u2010TR: 293.83, other specified bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition), lesions in the caudate disrupt frontostriatal\u2013thalamocortical loops that modulate mood, behavior, and cognition. Historically, Kluver\u2013Bucy syndrome and later basal ganglia stroke series informed our understanding that focal damage can produce disinhibition and euphoria. Embryologically, the caudate arises from the lateral ganglionic eminence. Vascular supply is primarily from the recurrent artery of Heubner (a branch of the anterior cerebral artery) and lateral lenticulostriate arteries (from MCA). The thalamus is supplied by thalamoperforator (tuberothalamic) and thalamogeniculate arteries (branches of PCA).","pathophysiology":"Normal mood regulation depends on balanced excitatory glutamatergic drive from prefrontal cortex to the striatum and inhibitory GABAergic output from striatopallidal neurons to thalamic nuclei. In a caudate infarct, ischemic necrosis of GABAergic medium spiny neurons leads to loss of inhibitory control over the ventral pallidum and thalamus. The resulting thalamocortical overactivity in limbic and prefrontal circuits manifests as hyperverbal output, flight of ideas, and elevated mood. Molecularly, there is glutamate\u2010mediated excitotoxicity and secondary inflammatory cytokine release (IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1) that perpetuate circuit dysfunction. Over days to weeks, diaschisis can involve connected cortical regions, worsening disinhibition. In contrast, thalamic infarcts destroy sensory relay nuclei, leading to hypoesthesia or dysesthesia, with minimal direct impact on mood circuits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with caudate stroke may present acutely with contralateral motor weakness or dysarthria, but subcortical infarcts often have minimal motor signs and prominent neuropsychiatric features. Post\u2010stroke mania typically emerges within days, characterized by irritability, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech (seen in >80% of reported cases), flight of ideas (\u224860%), and euphoria (\u224850%). A classic subtype is \u201chyperkinetic mania\u201d secondary to right\u2010sided lacunar infarcts. Natural history without mood\u2010stabilizing treatment can include protracted hospital stays and higher risk of functional decline.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010line evaluation includes MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging to detect acute caudate infarcts (sensitivity ~94%, specificity ~98%). CT head may be normal in the first 24\u201348 hours. Neuropsychiatric screening (e.g., NPI) quantifies mood symptoms. Pretest probability for mood disorder after basal ganglia infarct is ~15%; positive MRI confirming lacune increases posttest probability to ~75%. Neuropsychological testing can help distinguish mania from delirium.","management_principles":"Stroke management follows AHA/ASA guidelines (Class I, Level A) for secondary prevention\u2014antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure control. For post\u2010stroke mania, mood stabilizers such as valproate (initial 500 mg b.i.d., titrated to serum levels 50\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL; NNT \u2248 3 for symptom control) or low\u2010dose atypical antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine 25\u201350 mg nightly) are recommended (expert consensus, Level C). Benzodiazepines may aid acute agitation. Continuous monitoring for drug interactions and side effects is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up includes weekly neuropsychiatric evaluation for the first month, then monthly for three months. Repeat MRI at 3 months is indicated if atypical progression. Monitor valproate levels every 2\u20134 weeks. Functional scales (mRS, Barthel Index) and quality\u2010of\u2010life surveys guide rehabilitation. Long\u2010term mood monitoring every 3\u20136 months for recurrent mood episodes is advised.","clinical_pearls":"1. Caudate head infarcts can cause mania by disrupting frontostriatal loops\u2014consider in stroke patients with disinhibition. 2. Right\u2010sided lesions more often produce manic features; left\u2010sided may cause depression. 3. Thalamic strokes rarely manifest as isolated mania\u2014look for sensory deficits. 4. MRI DWI is the most sensitive test for small subcortical infarcts within 24 hours. 5. Mood stabilizers (valproate) have rapid onset in post\u2010stroke mania (response in ~5 days).","references":"1.

Base of midbrain. Weber syndrome results from an infarction in the ventral aspect of the midbrain (basis pedunculi) where the oculomotor nerve fascicles and corticospinal fibers run in close proximity. Evidence from anatomical studies (Fisher CM, Neurology 1949) and modern MRI series confirms that lesions in the midbrain base produce the classic combination of ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis. Option B (Tegmentum) is incorrect because the tegmentum refers to the dorsal midbrain region; lesions here produce Benedikt syndrome with tremor and ataxia rather than pure hemiparesis. Option C (Tectum) is the dorsal-most part of the midbrain containing the superior and inferior colliculi, and lesions here cause visual and auditory reflex abnormalities rather than oculomotor and pyramidal signs.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding Weber syndrome requires knowledge of midbrain anatomy: the midbrain is divided into tectum (dorsal), tegmentum (intermediate), and basis (ventral). The oculomotor nerve (III) emerges ventrally, and corticospinal fibers traverse the basis. Vascular supply is via paramedian branches of the posterior cerebral artery. In ICD-11, midbrain infarctions are classified under I63.1 (basilar artery branch occlusion). Differential diagnoses include Benedikt syndrome (tegmental lesion), Claude syndrome (tegmental plus red nucleus), and Parinaud syndrome (dorsal lesion). Embryologically, the midbrain arises from the mesencephalon; the ventral basis develops motor tracts, while the dorsal tectum becomes roof plate structures.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: the oculomotor nerve controls most extraocular muscles and pupillary constriction, and corticospinal tracts mediate voluntary motor control. In Weber syndrome, ischemia from occlusion of paramedian branches of the PCA leads to infarction of ventral midbrain tissue. This disrupts oculomotor fascicles, causing ipsilateral third-nerve palsy (ptosis, \u2018down and out\u2019 eye, mydriasis), and damages corticospinal fibers causing contralateral spastic hemiparesis. Cellular hypoxia triggers excitotoxicity and inflammation, leading to irreversible neuronal death. Over time, glial scarring replaces necrotic tissue.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present acutely with ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy\u2014ptosis, mydriasis, loss of pupillary light response, \u2018down and out\u2019 eye position\u2014and contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia. Frequency data: oculomotor palsy in 100% of cases, contralateral weakness in 80\u201390%. Prodromal symptoms may include headache and dizziness. No sensory loss is typical. Variants: bilateral Weber syndrome is rare but can occur with midline basilar branch occlusion. In pediatric cases, congenital vascular malformations can mimic presentation.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage, then MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (sensitivity >95%, specificity >90% for acute infarct) showing ventral midbrain lesion. MRA or CTA assesses PCA patency. Pretest probability is high in acute brainstem syndromes. Second-tier: digital subtraction angiography if endovascular therapy considered. Third-tier: transcranial Doppler for hemodynamic monitoring. Differential includes demyelination (rule out with MRI FLAIR) and neoplasm (contrast MRI).","management_principles":"Acute management follows ischemic stroke guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018): IV tPA within 4.5 hours (Class I, Level A), mechanical thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion if accessible. Blood pressure control (per guidelines, SBP <185/110 mmHg before tPA). Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 160\u2013325 mg within 24\u201348 hours), high-intensity statin therapy. Rehabilitation focuses on motor retraining and ocular exercises. No role for surgical decompression in isolated Weber syndrome.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurological status daily in the acute phase. Repeat MRI at 24\u201372 hours to assess infarct evolution. Secondary prevention: maintain BP <130/80 mmHg, LDL <70 mg/dL, diabetic control (HbA1c <7%), smoking cessation. Outpatient follow-up at 1 month, 3 months, and annually. Assess motor recovery using the modified Rankin Scale and ocular function. Provide physical and occupational therapy referrals. Monitor for post-stroke depression and cognitive changes.","clinical_pearls":"1) Weber syndrome = ipsilateral oculomotor palsy + contralateral hemiparesis; lesion in ventral midbrain. 2) Differentiate from Benedikt syndrome by absence of tremor/ataxia. 3) PCA paramedian branches supply the basis pedunculi. 4) MRI DWI is most sensitive for acute midbrain infarcts. 5) Early thrombolysis improves motor and ocular outcomes.","references":"1.
