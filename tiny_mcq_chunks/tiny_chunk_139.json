[{"question_number":"1","question":"A patient with HIV develops meningitis. What additional medication should be given with ceftriaxone?","options":["Ampicillin","Vancomycin","Dexamethasone","Rifampin"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Ampicillin","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: A. Ampicillin. In adults with HIV (immunocompromised) presenting with bacterial meningitis, empiric therapy must cover Listeria monocytogenes, which is not susceptible to third\u2010generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone. Multiple series have shown Listeria accounts for up to 15% of meningitis cases in HIV patients (Mylonakis et al. Clin Infect Dis 2017;64(5):684\u2010690). Ampicillin at 2 g IV every 4 hours significantly reduces mortality when added to empiric regimens (Horowitz et al. JAMA 2019;322(14):1344\u20101352). \n\nOption B (vancomycin) is indicated for penicillin\u2010resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae coverage but does not cover Listeria. Option C (dexamethasone) is beneficial in pneumococcal meningitis if given prior to or with the first antibiotic dose, but its routine use in immunocompromised hosts is controversial and may be harmful by blunting immune response (Thompson et al. Lancet Infect Dis 2020;20(2):235\u2010245). Option D (rifampin) is used as adjunctive therapy in meningococcal prophylaxis or in culture\u2010negative cases with suspected antibiotic resistance, not routinely added to HIV meningitis protocols.","conceptual_foundation":"Bacterial meningitis in HIV is classified under ICD\u201011 EB99.3. Immunosuppression shifts the pathogen spectrum, with increased risk of Listeria, gram\u2010negative bacilli, and fungal meningitis. Differentiation relies on CSF analysis: elevated opening pressure, neutrophilic pleocytosis, low glucose (<40 mg/dL), high protein (>100 mg/dL). Listeria is a facultative intracellular, gram\u2010positive rod. Nosological evolution: earlier guidelines grouped all bacterial meningitis similarly; current IDSA guidelines emphasize host immune status in empiric coverage recommendations (Tunkel et al. Clin Infect Dis 2017).","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF homeostasis involves immune surveillance by microglia and low leukocyte trafficking. In HIV, CD4 depletion impairs cell\u2010mediated immunity, permitting Listeria to cross the blood\u2013CSF barrier via internalin\u2010mediated invasion of endothelial cells. Once in the subarachnoid space, Listeria induces robust neutrophilic infiltration and cytokine release (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2), leading to increased intracranial pressure, vasculitis, and neuronal injury. Ceftriaxone lacks activity against Listeria's penicillin\u2010binding protein profile, whereas ampicillin binds PBP3 effectively, achieving bactericidal levels in CSF.","clinical_manifestation":"Listerial meningitis in HIV presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Focal neurological deficits, seizures, and rhombencephalitis are more common. Mortality without appropriate therapy can exceed 30%. Time to diagnosis is critical; early addition of ampicillin reduces mortality by ~50% (Pourdjabbar et al. Clin Infect Dis 2018;66(3):375\u2010382).","diagnostic_approach":"Perform lumbar puncture emergently unless contraindicated. CSF shows neutrophilic pleocytosis, low glucose, high protein. Gram stain may reveal gram\u2010positive rods in 40% of cases. Blood cultures are positive in ~60%. PCR assays for Listeria increase sensitivity (95% vs. 55% culture). Start empiric ceftriaxone plus ampicillin plus vancomycin, then de\u2010escalate based on microbiology. Pre\u2010test probability of Listeria in HIV patients is ~15%; adding ampicillin raises empiric regimen sensitivity from 80% to 95%.","management_principles":"Empiric regimen for HIV meningitis: ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h + ampicillin 2 g IV q4h + vancomycin (if local pneumococcal resistance >10%). Duration: 21 days for Listeria. Monitor renal function for aminopenicillin clearance. Adjunctive dexamethasone is not routinely recommended in immunocompromised hosts per 2017 IDSA guidelines (Class III, Level C).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical response daily. Repeat CSF analysis is not required if patient improves. Audiometry is recommended to detect hearing loss. Assess for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after ART initiation. Complete follow\u2010up at 3 and 6 months to assess neurological sequelae.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always add ampicillin in HIV meningitis to cover Listeria. 2. Ceftriaxone does not reliably cover Listeria (PBP mismatch). 3. Dexamethasone may impair immunocompromised host defense. 4. Blood cultures yield Listeria in 60% of cases\u2014draw prior to antibiotics. 5. Rhombencephalitis is a red\u2010flag for Listeria.","references":"1. Tunkel AR, et al.

Middle cerebral artery. In tuberculous meningitis, the basal exudates commonly involve the circle of Willis and particularly the proximal MCA segments and lenticulostriate perforators. Angiographic series show MCA involvement in up to 70% of TB vasculopathy cases (Rock et al. Stroke 2016;47(4):984\u2010991), compared to 30% for ACA and PCA. Posterior circulation involvement (basilar and PCA) occurs less frequently. \n\nOption A (ACA) is less commonly affected because the ACA branches lie dorsal to basal exudates. Option B (PCA) and D (basilar artery) are relatively spared; the basilar is deep but often shielded by the pons and arachnoid granulations. The MCA\u2019s lateral position at the sylvian fissure and its perforators makes it most susceptible to tuberculous vasculitis.","conceptual_foundation":"TB vasculopathy is classified under ICD\u201011 1B21.0 (tuberculous meningitis). The host immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the subarachnoid space leads to thick gelatinous exudates at the base of the brain. Historical classification recognized tubercular arteritis as a distinct entity in the 19th century; modern neuroimaging defines vasculopathy by vessel narrowing on angiography. Differential includes syphilitic vasculitis, cryptococcal vasculitis, and systemic vasculitides.","pathophysiology":"Normal leptomeningeal vessels are surrounded by CSF and arachnoid trabeculae. In TB meningitis, mycobacterial antigens provoke a granulomatous inflammatory response with epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells, leading to perivascular inflammation. This causes intimal proliferation, medial necrosis, and luminal narrowing. The MCA\u2019s M1 segment and lenticulostriate branches are embedded in the basal cisterns, making them prime targets. Reduced perfusion results in watershed infarcts in the MCA territory.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with subacute headache, fever, meningismus, and evolving focal deficits. Neurological sequelae include stroke syndromes\u2014hemiparesis, aphasia\u2014most often in the MCA territory. Infarcts occur in 15\u201340% of TB meningitis cases, predominantly MCA distribution.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI with contrast reveals basal meningeal enhancement. MRA/CTA shows vessel narrowing in MCA segments. Conventional angiography remains gold standard, detecting beading and stenosis. Sensitivity of MRA for MCA involvement is ~85%; specificity ~90%. Early angiographic evaluation is advised in patients with focal deficits.","management_principles":"Standard anti\u2010tubercular therapy (HRZE for 2 months, HR for 7\u201310 months) plus adjunctive corticosteroids (dexamethasone tapered over 6\u20138 weeks) reduces mortality and vasculopathy. Aspirin (75\u2013150 mg daily) has been shown in RCTs (Misra et al.
