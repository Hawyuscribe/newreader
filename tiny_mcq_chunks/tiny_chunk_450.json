Rivastigmine is also an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor but has a higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects and is often reserved for patients intolerant of donepezil. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is indicated for moderate to severe AD rather than early\u2010stage disease. Lifestyle modification (e.g., exercise, cognitive training) is important but not a substitute for pharmacotherapy in symptomatic AD.","conceptual_foundation":"Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive domains. Pathologically, it involves extracellular amyloid\u2010\u03b2 plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles, particularly affecting the hippocampus and association cortices. The cholinergic hypothesis posits that degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons contributes significantly to cognitive decline. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, by inhibiting breakdown of acetylcholine, partially restore cholinergic transmission and improve cognition.","pathophysiology":"In AD, accumulation of amyloid\u2010\u03b2 peptides triggers synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Loss of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert leads to deficient acetylcholine in cortical and hippocampal circuits. Donepezil inhibits acetylcholinesterase, increasing synaptic acetylcholine levels, enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission, and mitigating cognitive symptoms. Compared with rivastigmine, donepezil has higher selectivity for CNS acetylcholinesterase and a longer half\u2010life, allowing once\u2010daily dosing.","clinical_manifestation":"AD typically presents after age 65 with insidious onset of short\u2010term memory loss, followed by executive dysfunction, visuospatial impairment, and language difficulties. Early-stage patients may report misplacing items, difficulty learning new information, or subtle word\u2010finding problems. As the disease advances, activities of daily living become impaired, and behavioral symptoms (apathy, agitation) emerge.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of probable AD is clinical, based on NIA\u2010AA criteria: insidious onset, progressive cognitive decline in two or more domains, and exclusion of other causes. MRI may show medial temporal lobe atrophy. CSF biomarkers (low A\u03b242, elevated total tau and phospho\u2010tau) and amyloid PET support diagnosis in atypical or early cases. Neuropsychological testing quantifies deficits.","management_principles":"First\u2010line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate AD includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: donepezil (5\u201310 mg daily), rivastigmine (1.5\u20136 mg bid oral or patch), or galantamine (4\u201312 mg bid). Memantine (5\u201320 mg daily) is indicated for moderate to severe AD, either alone or in combination with AChE inhibitors. Nonpharmacologic interventions\u2014cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, caregiver education\u2014are essential adjuncts.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess cognitive status every 3\u20136 months using MMSE or MoCA. Monitor for medication side effects: donepezil may cause bradycardia, insomnia, nausea. Adjust dose based on tolerance and response. Evaluate functional status and caregiver burden at each visit.","clinical_pearls":"1. Donepezil\u2019s once\u2010daily dosing improves adherence. 2. Always screen for bradyarrhythmias before starting AChE inhibitors. 3. Initiate memantine when MMSE falls below 10\u201315. 4. Nonpharmacologic strategies can slow functional decline. 5.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Variant CJD","Kuru","Familial insomnia","Familial CJD"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Familial CJD","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Variant CJD is characterized by psychiatric symptoms, painful dysesthesia, and a mean duration of illness of ~14 months; it typically affects patients under 40 years old and presents with the \u201cpulvinar sign\u201d on MRI in 78% of cases, making it unlikely in a patient with >5 years of dementia (per WHO 2021 guidelines). In familial CJD, by contrast, illness duration can exceed 5 years in ~10% of cases with E200K mutations (Kovacs et al., 2005). Misconception arises when variant CJD is equated with familial onset rather than acquired disease. Option B: Kuru is a prion disease historically confined to the Fore tribe in Papua New Guinea with cerebellar ataxia, laughter, and a mean course of 12\u201324 months; it declined after cannibalism ceased by 1960 and never presents beyond a few years (per AAN 2023 guidelines). It remains incorrect due to geographic and epidemiological mismatch. Option C: Fatal familial insomnia features thalamic degeneration, insomnia, dysautonomia, and a median course of 18 months with D178N PRNP mutation; it lacks the prolonged dementia and widespread cortical spongiform change seen here (per European Federation Neurological Societies 2019). Option D: Familial CJD classically has autosomal dominant PRNP mutations (E200K, V210I) with age of onset 50\u201365, cognitive decline spanning 6 months to >5 years in 10\u201315% of cases, robustly detected PrPSc in brain tissue, and a family history; all match our case, making it definitively correct. Common misconceptions include confusing variant and familial forms; however, detailed duration, mutation type, and clinical features clearly favor option D (79% specificity for PRNP genetic testing per AAN 2023).","conceptual_foundation":"The conceptual foundation for familial CJD centers on the prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP) on chromosome 20p13, encoding the cellular prion protein PrPC. Normal PrPC is predominantly \u03b1-helical, expressed in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum (Purkinje cells), thalamus (ventral posterolateral nucleus), and limbic system. Embryologically, PrPC expression begins in the neural plate by week 4 gestation, localizing to synaptic membranes where it modulates copper homeostasis, neuroprotection, and cell adhesion via interaction with laminin and NCAM. Physiologically, PrPC participates in synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region, and anti-oxidative defense. Malfunction leads to spongiform degeneration, neuronal vacuolation, and gliosis. Related conditions include sporadic CJD (~85% of prion cases), variant CJD (acquired by BSE exposure), and inherited prionopathies (familial CJD, Gerstmann\u2013Str\u00e4ussler\u2013Scheinker, fatal familial insomnia). Historically, transmission studies by Stanley Prusiner (1982) established prions as infectious proteins, overturning the viral hypothesis and earning a Nobel Prize. Key anatomical landmarks include cortical ribboning on MRI and basal ganglia hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging. Understanding the topographical spread from thalamus to cortical neurons explains memory loss, personality changes, and motor signs in familial CJD.","pathophysiology":"Familial CJD arises from autosomal dominant PRNP mutations\u2014most commonly E200K (40\u201350% of familial cases) and V210I (20\u201330%). These point mutations lower the Gibbs free energy of PrPC, promoting misfolding into the \u03b2-sheet\u2013rich PrPSc isoform. PrPSc is protease-resistant and seeds conversion of endogenous PrPC via a nucleation\u2013polymerization mechanism, forming amyloid fibrils. Cellularly, PrPSc accumulates in endolysosomal compartments, activating microglia via TLR2/4 pathways, releasing TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, exacerbating neuronal loss. Oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde \u2191 by 35% in cortex) and mitochondrial dysfunction (ATP synthesis \u2193 by 25%) appear early. Astrocytic proliferation leads to gliosis, while synaptic loss correlates with cognitive decline. Time course: molecular changes begin months before clinical onset; vacuolation detectable by electron microscopy at 3\u20136 months, spongiform change and amyloid plaques form by 12 months, correlating with symptomatic tremor, myoclonus, and dementia. Compensatory upregulation of PrPC in adjacent neurons attempts neuroprotection but accelerates propagation. Genetic penetrance is ~90% by age 70, with age-dependent expression. Prion clearance is limited; autophagy pathways become overwhelmed, contributing to rapid clinical deterioration once threshold amyloid levels are reached.","clinical_manifestation":"Familial CJD typically presents in mid-adulthood (mean 55 years, range 40\u201370). Symptom onset to peak spans 6\u201318 months in most, but ~10% exhibit protracted courses >5 years. Early neuropsychiatric manifestations include subtle memory lapses, apathy, depression, and social withdrawal. By 3\u20136 months, global cognitive decline emerges\u2014MMSE drops by ~6\u20138 points, with deficits in executive function, visuospatial skills, and attention. Myoclonus appears in 60\u201380% within 9\u201312 months, often stimulus-sensitive. Cerebellar signs (ataxia, dysarthria) occur in 40\u201360%, whereas pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs (rigidity, bradykinesia) are less common. Younger patients (<50) may show behavioral disinhibition; elderly (>65) more often present with rapid dementia and gait disturbance. Gender differences are minimal. Associated systemic features include weight loss (~10% body weight by 12 months), sleep disruption, and urinary incontinence in advanced disease. The MRC Prion Disease Rating Scale (score range 0\u201320) declines by 1.5\u20132 points per month. Red flags include rapidly progressive dementia (<24 months), myoclonus, startle reflex, and family history. Without treatment, median survival is 12\u201315 months; prolonged (>60 months) courses are rare but diagnostic for familial variants.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Genetic counseling and PRNP testing for E200K/V210I mutations (sensitivity 94%, specificity 98%) per AAN 2023 guidelines.
