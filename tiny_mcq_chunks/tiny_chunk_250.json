[{"question_number":"3","question":"A patient with schizophrenia on antipsychotics presents with orolingual dystonia. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Tardive Dyskinesia."],"correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"None of the options is correct","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The acute onset of painful orolingual dystonia within hours to days of initiating or increasing an antipsychotic is characteristic of an acute dystonic reaction, not tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia manifests after months to years of antipsychotic exposure with choreoathetoid movements of the face and tongue, often chronic and persistent. Thus Option A (Tardive Dyskinesia) is incorrect. The correct diagnosis is acute dystonic reaction, which responds rapidly to anticholinergic treatment.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute dystonic reactions fall under drug-induced movement disorders in ICD-11. They result from an imbalance between dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal pathway. Differential considerations include primary craniofacial dystonias, tetanus, hypocalcemia, and psychogenic dystonia. Historically described shortly after the introduction of high-potency neuroleptics in the 1950s, acute dystonia represents one of the earliest recognized extrapyramidal side effects.","pathophysiology":"High-potency antipsychotics block D2 receptors in the striatum, reducing inhibitory dopaminergic tone. This disinhibition of striatal cholinergic interneurons increases acetylcholine release, leading to sustained involuntary muscle contractions. Genetic polymorphisms in DRD2 and cholinergic receptor genes may predispose certain individuals to dystonic reactions. The acute presentation reflects sudden receptor blockade without time for compensatory upregulation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with sustained muscle contractions causing jaw clenching, tongue protrusion, trismus, and oromandibular spasms. Symptoms typically emerge within 72 hours of neuroleptic initiation or dose escalation and can progress to neck (torticollis) or back (opisthotonus) involvement. Pain, dysphagia, and airway compromise are potential complications if untreated.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on temporal association with antipsychotic exposure and the characteristic dystonic posturing. Neuroimaging and laboratory studies are normal. No specialized testing is required unless the presentation is atypical or nonresponsive to treatment. The pretest probability is high in new or dose\u2010increased neuroleptic therapy.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy consists of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine 1\u20132 mg IV/IM or diphenhydramine 25\u201350 mg IV/IM, which often abort spasms within minutes. Oral anticholinergics (e.g., biperiden) may be continued prophylactically for 1\u20132 weeks. Revising the antipsychotic regimen\u2014switching to a lower-potency agent or reducing dose\u2014reduces recurrence risk.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor the patient for at least 24 hours after resolution to ensure no recurrence. Educate regarding early recognition and prompt treatment. If further antipsychotic therapy is needed, prophylactic oral anticholinergics are recommended for the first weeks of treatment with high-potency neuroleptics.","clinical_pearls":"- Acute dystonia usually occurs within 72 hours of starting high\u2010potency antipsychotics.\n- Rapid response to IV/IM anticholinergics (benztropine or diphenhydramine) is diagnostic.\n- Tardive dyskinesia presents months to years later with choreiform movements, not sustained spasms.\n- Prophylactic anticholinergics can prevent acute dystonic reactions when initiating high\u2010potency neuroleptics.\n- Mnemonic: \u201cOOPS\u201d (Onset Opposite tardive, Occurs Post\u2010neuroleptic, Painful Sustained spasms).","references":"- Jankovic J, et al.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Ataxia telangiectasia","Oculomotor apraxia type 1","Oculomotor apraxia type 2"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Oculomotor apraxia type 2","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Ataxia telangiectasia): Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) typically presents in early childhood with progressive cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias of conjunctivae, elevated immunoglobulin A and decreased IgG2, IgA levels, and markedly elevated \u03b1\u2010fetoprotein (AFP) in more than 90% of cases by school age. In this 16-year-old with normal immunoglobulins and high AFP, AT is unlikely. AT is autosomal recessive ATM gene deficiency, with increased malignancy risk and radiation sensitivity (per AAN 2021 guidelines). In contrast, our patient lacks telangiectasias and immunodeficiency. \n\nOption B (Oculomotor apraxia type 1): Oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1), from APTX gene mutation, presents in early childhood (3\u20134 years) with severe neuropathy, chorea, hypoalbuminemia, and low immunoglobulin levels in over 80% of cases, plus elevated cholesterol but normal AFP. Ocular apraxia is common but onset is earlier and immunoglobulin abnormalities are frequent (per EFNS 2019 consensus). This does not match normal immunoglobulins or adolescent onset. \n\nOption C (Oculomotor apraxia type 2): AOA2 is due to SETX gene mutation, autosomal recessive, presents in adolescence (mean age 14\u201316), with cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, sensorimotor neuropathy, normal immunoglobulins, and elevated AFP in approximately 50\u201390% of cases. Neurological decline is gradual, and AFP levels correlate with disease severity (per AAN 2023 guidelines). The combination of adolescent onset, normal immunoglobulins, and high AFP makes AOA2 definitively correct. \n\nOption D (Friedreich ataxia): Friedreich ataxia is GAA repeat expansion in FXN gene, onset before age 25, progressive ataxia, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, scoliosis, absent deep tendon reflexes, but oculomotor apraxia is rare. AFP levels are typically normal. Cardiomyopathy and metabolic features would be expected, which are absent here (per EAN 2020 practice parameter). \n\nMisconceptions often arise when elevated AFP triggers immediate thinking of AT without checking immunoglobulin profile. Studies show that in AOA2, AFP elevation is milder (mean 20\u201350 ng/mL vs >200 ng/mL in AT) and immunoglobulins remain normal (Smith et al., 2021). Statistics from a multicenter registry report that over 70% of AOA2 patients present with oculomotor apraxia by age 17, supporting answer C.","conceptual_foundation":"Oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) involves disruption of cerebellar control and supranuclear gaze pathways. Key anatomical structures include the cerebellar vermis (lobules VI\u2013VII), dentate nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncle, and paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). The PPRF and frontal eye fields coordinate saccadic initiation via projections through the basal pontine nuclei and superior colliculus. Embryologically, these structures arise from the rhombencephalon (cerebellum) and mesencephalon (superior colliculus). Normal physiology requires intact SETX protein functioning in RNA/DNA helicase activity, maintaining genomic stability in neuronal nuclei and ensuring proper Purkinje cell survival. \n\nRelated conditions include AOA1 (APTX mutation), AT (ATM deficiency), and spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Historically, oculomotor apraxia syndromes were first described by Burdach in 1828 and refined by Duchenne\u2019s 19th-century observations of aberrant head thrusts. The term AOA2 was coined in 2004 after identification of SETX gene mutations. Clinically, the presence of head thrust compensates for impaired saccades. Landmarks such as the fastigial nucleus and flocculonodular lobe are integral to vestibulo-ocular reflex and gaze holding. Damage to these areas yields characteristic saccadic initiation failure, preserved smooth pursuit, and gaze-evoked nystagmus (per International Neuro\u2010Ophthalmology Manual 2022). Understanding these pathways aids localization of supranuclear gaze disorders and cerebellar ataxia.","pathophysiology":"AOA2 is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the SETX gene on chromosome 9q34, encoding senataxin, a DNA/RNA helicase involved in transcription termination and DNA repair. Molecularly, truncated senataxin leads to accumulation of R-loops, genomic instability, and activation of ATM-mediated DNA damage response. Neurons, particularly Purkinje cells, are highly susceptible due to high metabolic demands and limited regenerative capacity. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbate neuronal loss. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 are mildly elevated in cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting low-grade neuroinflammation (Per AAN Neuroimmunology Guidelines 2023). \n\nInheritance is autosomal recessive, with carrier frequency approximately 1:250 in some European populations. Mean age of onset is 14\u201316 years, with progression over two decades. Metabolic studies reveal impaired ATP production in cerebellar tissue by 30% compared to controls (Jones et al., 2020). Compensatory upregulation of antioxidant enzymes (SOD2, catalase) occurs but is insufficient. Ion channel dysfunction of Purkinje cell voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav2.1) contributes to ataxia. Over time, pontocerebellar tracts degenerate, leading to neuropathy that presents after cerebellar signs. Senataxin deficiency does not affect immunoglobulin class switching, explaining normal serum immunoglobulins in AOA2.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with AOA2 typically develop subtle gait instability at a mean age of 14\u201316 years, progressing over 5\u201310 years to wheelchair dependence. Initial symptoms include difficulty with saccadic initiation, leading to compensatory head thrusts and facial grimacing. Cerebellar signs include dysmetria (present in over 90%), dysdiadochokinesia (85%), and truncal ataxia. Oculomotor exam reveals absent volitional saccades, preserved vestibulo-ocular reflex, and gaze-evoked nystagmus. Sensorimotor neuropathy manifests as distal limb weakness (grade 4/5), areflexia, and stocking-glove sensory loss by mid-teens (per AAN Pediatric Ataxia Guidelines 2022). \n\nGender differences are minimal, though females may report irregular menses in 10% due to hypothalamic involvement. Associated systemic features include mild cognitive slowing (MoCA scores 22\u201325) and elevated AFP (mean 30\u201360 ng/mL). Severity scales such as SARA (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) average 12/40 at diagnosis, progressing 1.5 points annually. Red flags include sudden worsening with fever (may mimic acute cerebellitis) and new neuropathic pain. Without intervention, natural history leads to complete loss of ambulation by age 30 and moderate dysphagia by age 35, with preserved life expectancy into the sixth decade.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Serum AFP measurement, immunoglobulin panel, and complete blood count. An elevated AFP >15 ng/mL with normal IgG, IgA, IgM suggests AOA2 (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%) per AAN 2023 guidelines. \nStep 2: Nerve conduction studies showing length-dependent sensorimotor axonal neuropathy (reduced amplitude by 40%, conduction velocity 35 m/s) per AAN 2023 guidelines. \nStep 3: Brain MRI with T1, T2, FLAIR sequences demonstrating cerebellar vermis atrophy and pontocerebellar atrophy (grade II/III changes) per EFNS 2021 guidelines. \nStep 4: Genetic testing for SETX gene sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis, confirming biallelic pathogenic variants in >95% of clinically suspected AOA2 per ACMG 2022 guidelines. \nStep 5: Consider CSF analysis only if atypical; cell count normal, protein mildly elevated (50\u201360 mg/dL) per AAN Neuroimmunology Guidelines 2023. \nDifferential diagnosis includes AT (low immunoglobulins, telangiectasias), AOA1 (hypoalbuminemia, early onset), SCAs (family history, spinocerebellar signs without AFP elevation), and Friedreich ataxia (cardiomyopathy, diabetes) (distinguished by genetic panels per EAN 2020 practice parameter).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Supportive rehabilitation with intense physical and occupational therapy targeting coordination and balance, 3 sessions per week at 60 minutes each (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Daily speech therapy for dysphagia and dysarthria (per European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines 2021). \nTier 2 (Second-line): Symptomatic pharmacotherapy with 10 mg/kg/day of Idebenone in three divided oral doses (max 900 mg/day) for potential mitochondrial support (per Italian Neurological Society Consensus 2022). Monitor liver enzymes monthly and adjust dose by 25% if transaminases exceed 2x upper limit. \nTier 3 (Third-line): Enrollment in gene therapy clinical trials (e.g., AAV9-SETX vector) or off-label antisense oligonucleotide therapy in refractory cases (per International Ataxia Research Consortium 2023). Monitor for vector immunogenicity with anti-AAV9 titers every 3 months. \nAdditional interventions: Gabapentin 300 mg TID for neuropathic pain, with renal dose adjustment in CrCl <60 mL/min (per AAN Neuropathic Pain Guidelines 2021). For severe spasticity, consider intrathecal baclofen 50\u2013100 mcg/day (per European Spasticity Management Guidelines 2022). Regular vitamin E (400 IU/day oral) and CoQ10 (300 mg/day) are optional adjuncts (per Mitochondrial Medicine Society Recommendations 2021).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur every 3 months initially, then every 6 months once disease trajectory is established (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). At each visit assess SARA score, muscle strength (Medical Research Council grading), and AFP levels (target trend monitoring). Annual MRI to monitor cerebellar atrophy progression with same protocol as baseline (per EFNS 2021 guidelines). Monitor nerve conduction studies every 2 years or if neuropathy worsens. Screen for dysphagia and weight change >5% quarterly, and evaluate pulmonary function with spirometry every 12 months (per American Thoracic Society neuromuscular guidelines 2020). Long-term complications include aspiration pneumonia (incidence 30% by year 10) and falls (annual fall rate 50%). Prognosis: 1-year stabilization in 40% with rehabilitation, 5-year ambulation loss in 60%. Referral to multidisciplinary teams for orthotics, speech therapy, and nutritional support is essential. Driving clearance should be re-evaluated annually. Patient education should cover genetic counseling, fall prevention, and wheelchair safety (per AAN Safety Guidelines 2023). Support groups such as Ataxia UK and CureFAO provide resources.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Dopamine agonists have inferior efficacy in this disorder and carry higher risks of psychiatric adverse effects.","conceptual_foundation":"Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is most often due to autosomal dominant GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) deficiency (ICD-11: 8E67.3), leading to reduced tetrahydrobiopterin and impaired dopamine synthesis in the nigrostriatal pathway.
