Sydenham chorea presents 4\u20138 weeks post-infection, predominantly in girls aged 5\u201315, with generalized chorea, hypotonia, emotional lability, and gait instability. Chorea acanthocytosis and Huntington\u2019s disease are genetic, progressive, and onset later; Wilson\u2019s disease involves hepatic signs and Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings, with diagnostic ceruloplasmin abnormalities. Sydenham chorea diagnosis is clinical, supported by elevated anti-streptococcal titers (ASO, anti-DNase B) and echocardiography for carditis.","conceptual_foundation":"Chorea is classified under hyperkinetic movement disorders. Sydenham chorea is immune-mediated basal ganglia dysfunction post-streptococcal infection, categorized in ICD-11 as 1C06.0. Historical descriptions date to Sydenham (1686), with modern understanding of molecular mimicry evolving in the mid-20th century. Neuroanatomically, antibody-mediated cross-reaction targets striatal neurons, particularly the caudate and putamen, disrupting GABAergic pathways. Cardiac, joint, and neurologic manifestations define rheumatic fever spectrum.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor control requires balance between inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory dopaminergic signaling in the basal ganglia. In Sydenham chorea, antibodies to group A streptococcal M protein cross-react with neuronal antigens (e.g., lysoganglioside GM1), altering dopamine receptor function, increasing striatal dopamine release, and leading to chorea. Complement activation and microglial inflammation further disrupt circuits. These changes are transient, explaining the monophasic course over weeks to months.","clinical_manifestation":"Sydenham chorea presents with generalized chorea, motor impersistence (e.g., \u2018milkmaid\u2019s grip\u2019), emotional lability, and hypotonia. Onset is subacute over days to weeks. Approximately 50% have carditis, 20% have arthritis. The condition is self-limited, lasting 2\u20136 months. Diagnosis uses Jones criteria (2015 AHA): one major neurological criterion (chorea) plus evidence of preceding streptococcal infection.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: ASO titer and anti-DNase B (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%), throat culture, rapid antigen test. Echocardiogram to detect carditis (recommendation Class I, Level B). Brain MRI rarely shows basal ganglia hyperintensities but is used to exclude other causes. Pretest probability in a child with new-onset chorea and recent pharyngitis is >70%; positive ASO increases post-test probability to >95%.","management_principles":"Primary therapy includes haloperidol or valproic acid (Class II studies: chorea reduction ~60\u201380%) with dosing titrated to clinical response. Penicillin prophylaxis (benzathine penicillin G IM every 4 weeks) prevents recurrence of rheumatic fever. Corticosteroids or IVIG may be used for severe chorea (Class III evidence). Benzathine penicillin is recommended indefinitely or until age 21 per AHA guidelines.","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurology follow-up every 4\u20136 weeks until resolution. Cardiology follow-up for valvular involvement every 6\u201312 months. PPSV23 and annual influenza vaccination recommended. Monitor for neuropsychiatric sequelae (OCD, ADHD) annually.","clinical_pearls":"1. Sydenham chorea is the only major Jones criterion that can be the sole manifestation; 2. Chorea can persist for months despite antibiotics; 3. Motor impersistence (milkmaid\u2019s grip) is pathognomonic; 4. Penicillin prophylaxis prevents recurrence; 5.

Breast cancer can cause paraneoplastic neurological syndromes but not OMS. Medulloblastoma is a malignant cerebellar tumor without an established link to OMS. Ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma likewise lack association with the characteristic chaotic eye movements and myoclonic jerks of OMS.","conceptual_foundation":"OMS is a rare pediatric paraneoplastic and presumed autoimmune condition featuring chaotic, multidirectional saccades (opsoclonus), myoclonus, ataxia, and irritability. It is classified under ICD-11 as paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (8D68). Differential diagnoses include acute cerebellitis, postinfectious cerebellar ataxia, and anti-GAD ataxia. OMS pathogenesis involves immune cross-reactivity between tumor antigens and cerebellar/brainstem neurons, leading to neuronal dysfunction without direct tumor invasion.","pathophysiology":"Under normal circumstances, saccadic eye movements are mediated by omnipause neurons in the pontine raphe and burst neurons in the paramedian pontine reticular formation. In OMS, autoantibodies generated against neuroblastoma antigens (e.g., Hu, Ri) disrupt inhibitory control, causing loss of omnipause neuronal inhibition and resulting in relentless, high-frequency, multidirectional saccades. Myoclonus arises from hyperexcitable brainstem and cerebellar circuits. Cytokine-mediated inflammation and B-cell\u2013mediated antibody production drive neuronal dysfunction rather than direct cytotoxicity.","clinical_manifestation":"OMS typically presents in children aged 6 months to 3 years with subacute onset of ataxia, irritability, sleep disturbance, and vomiting. Cardinal signs are multidirectional unpredictable saccadic eye movements (opsoclonus) and arrhythmic myoclonic jerks. Developmental regression is common. In approximately 50% of cases, a neuroblastoma is identified, most often in the adrenal medulla or sympathetic chain. Without treatment, children may develop chronic ataxia, speech and cognitive delays.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by MRI (often normal or showing mild cerebellar swelling), CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (60%), and elevated neuronal autoantibodies in serum/CSF (anti-Hu, anti-Ri in <50%). Whole-body imaging (MIBG scintigraphy, MRI/CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis) and urinary catecholamine metabolites (HVA, VMA) screening detect neuroblastoma. Paraneoplastic antibody panels have variable sensitivity; a negative panel does not exclude the diagnosis.","management_principles":"Tumor removal is critical in paraneoplastic OMS; complete resection of neuroblastoma improves neurologic outcomes. Immunotherapy (high-dose corticosteroids, IVIG, rituximab, cyclophosphamide) is used to dampen the immune response. Early and aggressive treatment correlates with better motor and cognitive recovery. Symptomatic therapies (benzodiazepines, antiepileptics) may help control myoclonus.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor for tumor recurrence with imaging and urinary catecholamine assays every 3\u20136 months for 2 years. Neurological follow-up includes developmental assessments, physical and occupational therapy for ataxia, and cognitive evaluation. Long-term immunosuppressive therapy tapering schedules vary; relapse occurs in up to 50% without maintenance therapy.","clinical_pearls":"1) Neuroblastoma is the most common tumor in pediatric OMS\u2014always screen with MIBG and urinary catecholamines. 2) Early immunotherapy (<1 month from onset) is associated with improved neurologic outcomes. 3) OMS often leads to long-term cognitive and behavioral sequelae despite tumor removal. 4) Paraneoplastic antibodies may be negative\u2014clinical diagnosis should not be delayed. 5) Multidisciplinary care (neurology, oncology, rehabilitation) is essential for optimal recovery.","references":"1.

Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing both ADHD symptoms and tic severity in randomized trials with effect sizes around 0.4\u20130.6 (McCracken et al., 2003; Scahill et al., 2006). Atomoxetine (Option A) also improves ADHD and may reduce tics but has a slower onset and carries a risk of mood changes. Methylphenidate (Option B) effectively treats ADHD but can exacerbate tics in some patients (although modern studies show minimal impact in most children). Guanfacine (Option D) is an alternative alpha-2 agonist with similar benefits but slightly less robust anti-tic effects compared to clonidine. Therefore, clonidine is most commonly used.","conceptual_foundation":"Tic disorders (DSM-5: 315.2 Tourette\u2019s disorder; 307.23 Persistent motor or vocal tic disorder) are classified as neurodevelopmental disorders. ADHD (DSM-5: 314.0) often coexists, with up to 60% comorbidity. Pathophysiologically, tics involve basal ganglia and cortical circuits with dopaminergic dysregulation, while ADHD involves dysfunctional frontostriatal networks and catecholaminergic transmission. The classification of tic disorders has evolved from DSM-IV\u2019s separate categories into an integrated neurodevelopmental spectrum in DSM-5, recognizing the frequent overlap with ADHD and OCD.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor patterning is regulated by the cortico\u2013striato\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical loops; in tic disorders, hyperactivity in the direct pathway due to dopamine receptor hypersensitivity leads to disinhibited motor output manifesting as tics. ADHD reflects underactivation of the prefrontal cortex and striatum, with reduced dopamine and norepinephrine availability impairing attention and impulse control. Clonidine stimulates presynaptic alpha-2 receptors in the locus coeruleus, reducing norepinephrine release, thereby modulating cortical excitability and improving attention; its secondary effect on striatal circuits dampens tic activity.","clinical_manifestation":"Motor tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent movements (e.g., eye blinking, shoulder shrugging), and vocal tics are sounds (e.g., throat clearing). Onset typically occurs between age 4\u20137, with peak severity around age 10\u201312. ADHD presents with inattention and hyperactivity\u2013impulsivity before age 12. In combined presentations, tic severity often fluctuates with ADHD symptom severity and psychosocial stressors. Natural history shows waxing\u2013waning tics, with improvement in adolescence in many patients.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical. Use the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) to quantify tics (inter-rater reliability 0.90) and ADHD Rating Scale-IV for inattention/hyperactivity. First-tier evaluation includes history, physical exam to exclude secondary causes (e.g., Wilson\u2019s disease), and assessment of comorbidities. No routine imaging or labs are indicated unless atypical features arise. Pretest probability of primary tic disorder in a child with chronic (\u2265\u20091 year) tics is >\u200990%.","management_principles":"Behavioral interventions (Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics, CBIT) are first-line. Pharmacotherapy is indicated for moderate to severe tics or ADHD-related impairment. Clonidine dosing starts at 0.05\u2009mg at bedtime, increasing weekly to a target of 0.1\u20130.2\u2009mg TID (max 0.4\u2009mg/day). Expected tic reduction is 30\u201340% by week 6; ADHD symptom improvement occurs concurrently. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate at each upward titration. Guanfacine XR is an alternative (1\u20134\u2009mg/day). Atomoxetine can be used if alpha agonists are insufficient or poorly tolerated; dose 0.5\u20131.2\u2009mg/kg/day. Stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines) may be used cautiously if ADHD impairment remains disabling after alpha agonist trial, with close tic monitoring.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 4\u20136 weeks initially to assess efficacy, side effects (hypotension, sedation), and growth parameters. After stability, visits can be spaced to every 3 months. Long-term management includes annual monitoring of cardiovascular status, ADHD and tic symptom trajectories, and adjustment of therapy as children mature. Transition of care planning is important in late adolescence.","clinical_pearls":"1. Alpha Agonist First: In ADHD with tics, start clonidine before stimulants to avoid tic exacerbation. 2. CBIT Adjunct: Behavioral therapy enhances pharmacologic effects and may reduce medication doses. 3. Titrate Slowly: Alpha-2 agonists require slow dose escalation to minimize hypotension. 4. Monitor Growth: Chronic clonidine use can affect weight gain\u2014track height/weight. 5.

Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is a mitochondrial disorder presenting in infancy or early childhood with developmental delay, regression, hypotonia, and characteristic bilateral symmetric T2 hyperintensities of the basal ganglia and brainstem on MRI. No other options were provided for comparison in this question.","conceptual_foundation":"Leigh syndrome belongs to the group of mitochondrial encephalopathies (ICD-11: 8A61.4). It is inherited most commonly in an autosomal recessive fashion or maternally via mitochondrial DNA mutations. Early descriptions date to Denis Leigh in 1951, and modern classification encompasses defects in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I\u2013V, and assembly factors. Differential diagnoses include other metabolic causes of basal ganglia signal changes such as Wilson disease, kernicterus, and organic acidurias.","pathophysiology":"Normal oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria generates ATP via the electron transport chain. In Leigh syndrome, mutations impair complexes I\u2013IV or pyruvate dehydrogenase, leading to decreased ATP production, increased lactate, and neuronal energy failure. The high metabolic demand of basal ganglia and brainstem gray matter predisposes these regions to necrosis and gliosis, visible as symmetric T2 hyperintensities.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present between 3\u201312 months with psychomotor regression, irritability, hypotonia, seizures, feeding difficulties, and episodes of lactic acidosis. Basal ganglia involvement leads to dystonia, chorea, or spasticity. The disease course is progressive, with most children surviving only a few years without supportive therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnostic evaluation includes MRI brain showing symmetric basal ganglia hyperintensities, plasma and CSF lactate elevations, muscle biopsy demonstrating ragged\u2010red fibers, and genetic testing for nuclear and mitochondrial DNA mutations. Lactate:pyruvate ratio in CSF, enzymatic assays of respiratory chain complexes in muscle or fibroblasts, and next-generation sequencing panels confirm the diagnosis.","management_principles":"Management is largely supportive. Thiamine (100\u2013500 mg/day), coenzyme Q10 (5\u201330 mg/kg/day), riboflavin, and dichloroacetate may improve mitochondrial function in selected patients.

No curative therapy exists; the approach is multidisciplinary.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes serial MRI to monitor progression, regular assessment of growth, developmental milestones, lactate levels, and nutritional status. Surveillance for cardiomyopathy and respiratory compromise is essential. Genetic counseling is recommended for families.","clinical_pearls":"1. Symmetric basal ganglia T2 hyperintensities in an infant with regression strongly suggest a mitochondrial disorder such as Leigh syndrome. 2. Elevated lactate in blood or CSF is a key laboratory clue. 3. Muscle biopsy with ragged-red fibers supports the diagnosis but is not always required if genetic testing is definitive. 4. Treatment is supportive; thiamine and coenzyme Q10 may offer modest benefit. 5. Prognosis remains poor, with most patients succumbing in early childhood.","references":"1. Leigh D.
