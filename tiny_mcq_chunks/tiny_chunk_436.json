[{"question_number":"8","question":"What is the most common type of aura in mesial temporal lobe (MTL) seizures?","options":["Don\u2019t remember the choices."],"subspecialty":"Epilepsy","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Part Two","correct_answer":"None","correct_answer_text":"No options provided","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The question asks for the most common aura in mesial temporal lobe (MTL) seizures, but no answer choices were supplied. Based on literature, the prototypical aura is a rising epigastric sensation, often described as a visceral rising feeling in the abdomen. Other common auras include d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, fear, and olfactory hallucinations. Without provided options, we cannot map letters to these phenomena. The correct conceptual answer is epigastric rising sensation.","conceptual_foundation":"Focal seizures arising from the MTL originate in hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus. According to ICD-11, these are classified under 8A60.0 \u2018mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\u2019. Auras represent ictal awareness of abnormal electrical activity localized to limbic structures. The epigastric sensation likely reflects visceral afferent representation in the insular cortex through limbic connectivity.","pathophysiology":"Ictal discharges in the amygdala and insular cortex stimulate visceral afferent pathways, producing epigastric rising sensations. Synchronized firing spreads via the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum to hypothalamic and autonomic centers, triggering autonomic signs such as nausea, pallor, or tachycardia. Molecularly, aberrant glutamatergic transmission in limbic circuits underlies ictogenesis.","clinical_manifestation":"Epigastric auras are reported in up to 70\u201380 % of MTL epilepsy patients. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu occurs in 30\u201350 %, fear in 25\u201340 %, and olfactory auras in 5\u201310 %. Auras may precede impaired awareness by seconds and can recur as isolated events. Variants include gustatory and somatosensory manifestations when spread involves insular and opercular regions.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on detailed history of ictal symptoms. Video-EEG monitoring captures auras and correlates them with anterior temporal lobe ictiform discharges. High-resolution MRI identifies mesial temporal sclerosis in over 60 % of cases. PET and SPECT imaging further localize hypermetabolism or hyperperfusion in the mesial structures.","management_principles":"First-line antiepileptic drugs include levetiracetam, lamotrigine, or carbamazepine, each with Class I evidence in focal epilepsy. In refractory cases, anterior temporal lobectomy yields seizure freedom in up to 70 %. Vagus nerve stimulation may reduce seizure frequency by 50 % in those not candidates for surgery.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require follow-up every 3\u20136 months initially, with seizure diaries and, if indicated, repeat EEG. Long-term monitoring assesses drug efficacy, side effects, and quality of life. Surgical candidates undergo neuropsychological testing and Wada studies prior to resection.","clinical_pearls":"1. The rising epigastric sensation is the hallmark aura of mesial temporal lobe seizures. 2. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu auras suggest hippocampal involvement. 3. MRI evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis predicts surgical success. 4. Video-EEG capture of aura-ictal onset is diagnostic gold standard. 5. Early surgical referral in drug-resistant cases improves outcomes.","references":"1. Rosenow F, L\u00fcders H. Presurgical evaluation of epilepsy.

The pivotal randomized controlled trial by Fisher et al. (1998) showed a \u226550% reduction in seizure frequency in 30\u201340% of patients at 3 months, improving to ~50% responders at 1 year. Other surgical options such as resective surgery, laser ablation, or hemispherectomy require a clearly defined epileptogenic zone, which is absent in multifocal EEG patterns.","conceptual_foundation":"Epilepsy surgery options fall into resective (e.g., temporal lobectomy), disconnective (e.g., corpus callosotomy), and neuromodulation (VNS, deep brain stimulation, responsive neurostimulation). The ILAE 2017 presurgical evaluation algorithm recommends VNS when EEG shows bilateral independent or multifocal discharges. Multifocal spikes represent multiple independent epileptogenic zones, precluding focal resection.","pathophysiology":"VNS delivers intermittent electrical pulses to the left cervical vagus nerve, activating the nucleus tractus solitarius and locus coeruleus. This neuromodulates thalamocortical and limbic networks, increasing GABAergic tone and noradrenergic output to reduce seizure propagation. Chronic stimulation induces neuroplastic changes that suppress interictal discharges.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with multifocal epilepsy exhibit varied seizure types\u2014focal unaware, focal to bilateral tonic\u2013clonic\u2014often with normal MRI or multiple lesions (e.g., tuberous sclerosis). Interictal EEG shows spikes and sharp waves in multiple regions. Cognitive impairment and developmental delay may co-occur due to diffuse network involvement.","diagnostic_approach":"Presurgical workup includes long-term video-EEG monitoring confirming multifocal onset, high-resolution MRI, PET/SPECT to rule out focal lesions, and neuropsychological testing. Concordance of data is required for resective candidates; nonconcordant/multifocal cases proceed to VNS evaluation.","management_principles":"VNS implantation involves wrapping a bipolar electrode around the left vagus nerve and connecting to an implanted pulse generator. Stimulation parameters (output current, pulse width, frequency) are gradually increased over months. ASM regimens remain unchanged initially. Clinical response is assessed by seizure diaries.","follow_up_guidelines":"Device checks every 3\u20136 months; adjust output current by 0.25 mA increments up to 2.5 mA as tolerated. Monitor battery life (~8\u201310 years) and schedule generator replacement. Evaluate seizure frequency and adverse effects (hoarseness, cough).","clinical_pearls":"1. Multifocal EEG precludes resection; 2. VNS responder rate ~50% over 1 year; 3. Left vagus avoids cardiac innervation; 4. Stimulation effect may take 6\u201312 months; 5. Side effects are generally mild and reversible.","references":"1. Fisher RS, Handforth A. VNS randomized controlled trial. Neurology. 1998;51(1):48\u201355. DOI:10.1212/WNL.51.1.48; 2.

Increasing carbamazepine further risks dose\u2010related toxicity without a high likelihood of achieving seizure freedom. The 2010 ILAE definition of drug\u2010resistant epilepsy and subsequent AAN guidelines (Engel et al., 2012) recommend surgical referral after failure of two AEDs.","conceptual_foundation":"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (MTS) is the most common form of focal epilepsy in adults. In the 2017 ILAE classification, it is categorized under focal epilepsies of structural etiology. Hippocampal sclerosis involves neuronal loss and gliosis in CA1\u2013CA4 regions, often following an initial precipitating injury. Differential diagnoses include tumoral, neocortical temporal, and extra\u2010temporal epilepsies.","pathophysiology":"Normal hippocampal circuitry maintains excitation\u2010inhibition balance via GABAergic interneurons and glutamatergic pathways. In MTS, interneuron loss and mossy fiber sprouting create aberrant recurrent excitatory loops, leading to seizure generation. Upregulation of NMDA receptors and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines further lower seizure threshold.","clinical_manifestation":"MTLE patients typically present in adolescence or early adulthood with focal impaired awareness seizures. Auras such as epigastric rising sensation, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, or olfactory hallucinations occur, followed by automatisms like lip\u2010smacking and manual gestures. Seizures may secondarily generalize. Interictal EEG shows temporal spikes; MRI demonstrates hippocampal atrophy and T2/FLAIR hyperintensity.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010line diagnostic steps include high\u2010resolution 3 T epilepsy\u2010protocol MRI, prolonged video\u2010EEG monitoring for seizure lateralization/localization, and neuropsychological testing. Functional imaging with interictal FDG\u2010PET or ictal SPECT is used when MRI is inconclusive. Invasive monitoring (stereoelectroencephalography) is reserved for discordant noninvasive data.","management_principles":"Initial therapy for MTLE involves AEDs such as carbamazepine or lamotrigine; topiramate is used adjunctively. After failure of two adequate AED regimens, surgical evaluation for anterior temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalohippocampectomy is indicated. Surgical outcomes show seizure freedom in 60%\u201380% at one year with improved quality of life.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post\u2010surgical follow\u2010up includes periodic EEGs, MRI at 6\u201312 months to assess for complications, neuropsychological reassessment, and gradual AED tapering as indicated. Long\u2010term monitoring focuses on seizure control, cognitive outcomes, and psychosocial adjustment.","clinical_pearls":"Early referral for surgical evaluation in MTS improves outcomes: epilepsy duration >12 years prior to surgery is associated with lower seizure\u2010freedom rates. Drug\u2010resistance should be declared after two AED failures.","references":"[1] Engel J Jr et al. AAN Epilepsy Surgery Guidelines. Neurology. 2012;79(17):1868\u20131876.

In temporal lobe epilepsy, ictal semiology includes ipsilateral head/eye deviation and contralateral automatisms due to propagation to motor areas.","pathophysiology":"Ictal discharges in the temporal lobe propagate via limbic\u2010motor networks to the supplementary motor area, producing automatisms on the side opposite to the seizure focus.","clinical_manifestation":"Contralateral hand or oro\u2010alimentary automatisms (e.g., lip\u2010smacking) occur in >80% of unilateral temporal lobe seizures.
