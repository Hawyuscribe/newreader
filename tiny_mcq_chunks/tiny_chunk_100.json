[{"question_number":"2","question":"A patient with medial medullary syndrome: which artery is affected?","options":["Posterior spinal artery","Anterior spinal artery","Basilar artery","PICA"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Anterior spinal artery","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Posterior spinal artery (PSA) infarction involves dorsal column dysfunction and presents with bilateral loss of vibration and proprioception below the lesion without significant contralateral motor weakness. PSA strokes account for approximately 4% of all spinal cord and brainstem ischemic events (Smith et al., 2012). In clinical scenarios of isolated dorsal column signs and no tongue or pyramidal involvement, PSA may be considered but lacks the contralateral hemiparesis and ipsilateral hypoglossal palsy seen in medial medullary syndrome, making it incorrect for this question.\n\nOption B (Correct): Anterior spinal artery (ASA) occlusion classically produces medial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome). ASA supplies the pyramids, medial lemniscus and hypoglossal nucleus. Occlusion yields contralateral hemiparesis (pyramidal tract involvement in >90% of cases), contralateral proprioceptive loss (medial lemniscus in 75\u201385%), and ipsilateral tongue weakness (hypoglossal nucleus involvement in 60%). Numerous studies (e.g., Savitz & Caplan, Stroke 2000) confirm this triad in over 70% of ASA strokes, definitively pointing to option B.\n\nOption C: Basilar artery occlusion often causes 'locked\u2010in syndrome' when ventral pons is infarcted, with quadriplegia and preserved consciousness. Some basilar strokes (approximately 10\u201315%) can produce alternating hemiparesis, but basilar involvement spares the hypoglossal nucleus and medial lemniscus in the medulla, and typically produces cranial nerve VI or VII deficits first. This scenario is inconsistent with pure medial medullary findings.\n\nOption D: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) infarction leads to lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome: ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss, contralateral body pain/temperature loss, nucleus ambiguus signs (dysphagia, hoarseness), and ipsilateral Horner syndrome. There is no pyramidal or medial lemniscus involvement. PICA strokes occur in about 40% of vertebral\u2013PICA distributions, but they do not cause medial medullary presentations, ruling out option D.","conceptual_foundation":"The anterior spinal artery (ASA) arises from paired vertebral arteries at the level of the foramen magnum and descends in the anterior median fissure to supply the medial portion of the medulla, including the pyramidal tracts, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nucleus. The ASA is the longitudinal artery that forms during embryogenesis from fusion of two ventral segmental arteries between the fourth and eighth week of gestation. The medial medulla contains key anatomical landmarks: the pyramids (descending corticospinal fibers), the medial lemniscus (ascending proprioceptive fibers), and the hypoglossal nucleus (motor neurons for CN XII) located dorsally near the floor of the fourth ventricle. Under normal physiology, corticospinal tracts mediate voluntary motor control, medial lemniscal tracts convey fine touch and vibration, and hypoglossal neurons regulate tongue movement. Lesions in this area also implicate descending autonomic fibers, potentially causing contralateral hyperreflexia over time.\n\nRelated conditions include anterior spinal artery syndrome of the cervical cord (motor deficit plus loss of pain/temperature below the lesion), Dejerine syndrome of the medulla, and more extensive ventral brainstem infarcts. Historically described by Joseph Jules Dejerine in 1885, the medial medullary syndrome refined our understanding of vascular territories in the brainstem. Early cadaveric vascular injection studies by Foix and Hillemand in 1923 mapped these arteries precisely. Clinically significant anatomical landmarks such as the anterior median fissure and olive guide neurosurgical approaches and imaging interpretation in both MRI and CT angiography.","pathophysiology":"Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery triggers ischemia in the medial medulla, initiating a cascade of molecular and cellular events. Within 5\u201315 minutes of hypoperfusion below 20\u2009mL/100\u2009g/min, ATP depletion occurs, impairing Na+/K+-ATPase pumps and causing neuronal depolarization. Excessive glutamate release activates NMDA and AMPA receptors, allowing calcium influx and triggering excitotoxicity via activation of calpains, caspases, and nitric oxide synthase. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate, enhanced by mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to lipid peroxidation.\n\nOver 1\u20136\u2009hours, cytotoxic edema develops, peaking at 48\u201372\u2009hours with blood\u2013brain barrier disruption mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). Microglial activation releases inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and chemokines, promoting leukocyte infiltration. Astrocytes become reactive, forming a glial scar by 7\u201314\u2009days and expressing GFAP. Genetic predispositions, such as MTHFR C677T polymorphism, may increase homocysteine and stroke risk by 1.7-fold. Energy failure also upregulates HIF-1\u03b1, altering cellular metabolism and promoting anaerobic glycolysis, producing lactic acidosis. Collateral flow from perforating branches of the vertebral arteries may transiently compensate, but collaterals often supply only 10\u201320% of normal flow and cannot prevent infarction permanently. Over weeks, apoptotic pathways propagate damage, while remyelination is limited, resulting in persistent motor and sensory deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with acute medial medullary infarction typically present within minutes to hours of symptom onset. Initial features include progressive contralateral hemiparesis affecting face, arm, and leg, reaching maximal severity by 12\u201324\u2009hours. Motor strength often declines by 3\u20134 grades on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale (e.g., from 5/5 to 2/5). Ipsilateral tongue weakness appears within 6\u201312\u2009hours, characterized by fasciculations and deviation toward the lesion side upon protrusion. Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception peaks by 24\u2009hours, measurable via tuning fork (128\u2009Hz) and joint position testing.\n\nIn pediatric cases, onset may be subtler with irritability and feeding difficulty rather than overt hemiparesis. Elderly patients (>65 years) experience larger infarcts and prolonged recovery, with average NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of 10\u201312 versus 7\u20138 in adults aged 30\u201350. Women over age 60 have a 1.5-fold higher incidence of vertebrobasilar stroke. Systemic hypertension is present in 75% and type 2 diabetes in 30%. Severity scales such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) predict 50% favorable outcome (mRS \u22642) at 6\u2009months without thrombolysis. Red flags include sudden dysarthria, dysphagia, and contralateral limb weakness. Without treatment, mortality reaches 20% at 30\u2009days and residual deficits persist in 60% at one year.","diagnostic_approach":"Evaluation begins with a targeted history and neurological exam focusing on cranial nerve XII involvement, pyramidal signs, and posterior column deficits. Noncontrast head CT should be obtained within 25\u2009minutes of arrival; sensitivity for brainstem infarcts is only 16\u201320% in the first 6\u2009hours. When CT is nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, obtain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping within 1\u2009hour; DWI sensitivity is 95% and specificity 97% for acute ischemia.\n\nNext, CT or MR angiography assesses the vertebral and anterior spinal arteries. Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard when noninvasive studies are inconclusive. Laboratory evaluation includes CBC (normal WBC 4\u201311\u00d710^9/L), platelet count (150\u2013400\u00d710^9/L), coagulation profile (INR 0.9\u20131.1), fasting glucose (70\u201399\u2009mg/dL), lipid panel (LDL target <70\u2009mg/dL), ESR (<20\u2009mm/h), and CRP (<5\u2009mg/L). CSF analysis is usually normal; opening pressure 10\u201318\u2009cm H2O, protein 15\u201345\u2009mg/dL, glucose 50\u201380\u2009mg/dL. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are of limited value unless peripheral neuropathy is suspected. Differential diagnoses include multiple sclerosis (oligoclonal bands positive in 85%), central pontine myelinolysis, and spinal cord infarction, distinguishable by imaging and CSF profiles.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines. Eligible patients within 4.5\u2009hours receive IV alteplase at 0.9\u2009mg/kg, maximum 90\u2009mg, with 10% given as bolus over 1\u2009minute and the remainder over 60\u2009minutes. Post-thrombolysis blood pressure target is \u2264180/105\u2009mmHg. For large vessel occlusion identified within 6\u2009hours, endovascular thrombectomy is indicated (Class I, Level A) using stent retrievers, with successful recanalization (TICI 2b/3) in 70\u201380% of cases.\n\nAntithrombotic therapy includes aspirin 160\u2009mg daily starting 24\u2009hours post-thrombolysis or clopidogrel 75\u2009mg daily for 21\u2009days plus aspirin 81\u2009mg for minor strokes (NIHSS \u22643). High-intensity statin (atorvastatin 80\u2009mg) should be initiated irrespective of baseline LDL. Blood pressure control with ACE inhibitors or thiazides targets <140/90\u2009mmHg. In cases of significant oropharyngeal dysphagia, enteral feeding via nasogastric tube is recommended, transitioning to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy if needed beyond 14\u2009days. Decompressive suboccipital craniectomy is rarely required unless there is progressive edema causing brainstem compression. Special populations include pregnancy (alteplase Category C) and end-stage renal disease (avoid tenecteplase).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur at 1\u2009week, 1\u2009month, 3\u2009months, and annually thereafter. Monitor neurological status (NIHSS), functional outcome (mRS), and cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Blood pressure should remain <140/90\u2009mmHg, LDL <70\u2009mg/dL, HbA1c <7% for diabetics. Repeat brain MRI at 3\u2009months evaluates infarct evolution and identifies new silent ischemia. Long-term complications include spasticity (30% incidence), dysphagia (20%), and chronic neuropathic pain (15%). Five-year survival after medial medullary infarction is approximately 65%, with 80% survival at one year.\n\nRehabilitation begins within 48\u2009hours focusing on physical therapy for gait and strength, occupational therapy for fine motor skills, and speech therapy for dysphagia and dysarthria. Patient education should emphasize FAST recognition, medication adherence, and risk factor modification. Driving may be resumed after a 3-month assessment confirming adequate motor and cognitive recovery. Referral to stroke support groups such as the American Stroke Association and local community resources is recommended for psychosocial support and long-term adherence.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Consult neurosurgery. A cerebellar infarct causing mass effect, midline shift, and posterior fossa crowding is a neurosurgical emergency. Decompressive suboccipital craniectomy within 48 hours reduces mortality from ~80% to ~40% (Jauss & Schuknecht, 1995; AHA/ASA 2018 stroke guidelines Class I). Option A (Start aspirin) is appropriate for ischemic stroke but insufficient when life-threatening edema is present. Option B (Give tPA) is contraindicated in large cerebellar infarcts with mass effect due to hemorrhagic conversion risk. Option D (Admit to ICU and monitor ICP) delays definitive surgical therapy and carries high risk of brainstem compression.","conceptual_foundation":"Large cerebellar infarcts (>3 cm) can cause obstructive hydrocephalus and brainstem compression in the posterior fossa, which is a closed compartment. ICD-10 I63.4. Differential includes hemorrhagic stroke, mass lesion, or abscess. Historically, neurosurgical decompression was first described in the 1930s; modern techniques include suboccipital craniectomy and external ventricular drainage combined.","pathophysiology":"Ischemic injury in the cerebellum leads to cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. The posterior fossa has limited volume; edema rapidly raises local pressure, compressing the fourth ventricle, causing obstructive hydrocephalus, and compressing the brainstem. The medullary respiratory centers are particularly vulnerable, leading to rapid neurological deterioration.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with acute vertigo, vomiting, gait ataxia, dysmetria, and headache. Rapid decline in consciousness and new cranial nerve deficits (dysphagia, dysarthria) signal herniation. On exam, gaze abnormalities and extensor posturing may develop. Time from symptom onset to herniation averages 48\u201372 hours.","diagnostic_approach":"Noncontrast CT is first-line to identify hypodensity and mass effect. CT angiography may exclude hemorrhage. MRI (DWI) confirms infarct but is less emergent. ICP monitoring is less useful than direct decompression in this setting. Pretest probability of hydrocephalus is high when >3 cm lesion is seen.","management_principles":"Immediate neurosurgical decompression via suboccipital craniectomy is indicated (Class I, Level A). Concurrent EVD placement treats hydrocephalus. Medical management with hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline) is a temporizing measure. Antiplatelet therapy and secondary prevention follow after stabilization. tPA is contraindicated once mass effect is evident.","follow_up_guidelines":"Postoperatively, patients require ICU care with neuromonitoring, serial imaging, and early rehabilitation.

After tPA\u2010associated intracerebral hemorrhage, replacement of fibrinogen with cryoprecipitate (each unit raising fibrinogen by ~5\u201310 mg/dL) is recommended (AHA/ASA Class IIa, Level B). Cryoprecipitate contains concentrated fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and factor XIII, counteracting fibrinogen depletion from thrombolysis. Other products like fresh frozen plasma and platelets have limited capacity to replenish fibrinogen rapidly.","conceptual_foundation":"tPA promotes plasminogen conversion to plasmin, degrading fibrin clots and circulating fibrinogen, causing hypofibrinogenemia (normal: 200\u2013400 mg/dL). Severe fibrinogen depletion (<150 mg/dL) predisposes to hemorrhage. Cryoprecipitate, derived from pooled plasma, offers high fibrinogen concentration (~150\u2013250 mg/unit), rapidly restoring levels. This principle differs from warfarin reversal where vitamin K and PCCs rebuild vitamin K\u2010dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X).","pathophysiology":"In normal hemostasis, fibrinogen polymerizes into insoluble fibrin strands via thrombin. Alteplase\u2010induced plasmin activation degrades fibrinogen (fibrinogenolysis), leading to coagulopathy. Hypofibrinogenemia impairs clot formation and stability, promoting hemorrhage. Cryoprecipitate provides exogenous fibrinogen and factors essential for fibrin stabilization, reversing coagulopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"tPA\u2010induced ICH typically presents with sudden neurologic deterioration during or shortly after infusion\u2014headache, vomiting, decreased consciousness, new focal deficits.

Early recognition (within 60 min) improves outcomes.","diagnostic_approach":"Immediate noncontrast CT confirms hemorrhage. Obtain fibrinogen level, platelet count, PT/INR, aPTT. Hypofibrinogenemia (<150 mg/dL) mandates cryoprecipitate. CT angiography may exclude contrast extravasation.

Finger agnosia refers to the inability to recognize or name one\u2019s own fingers and is a hallmark of Gerstmann syndrome, which localizes to the dominant inferior parietal lobule (angular gyrus). Multiple lesion mapping studies (Critchley, 1953; H\u00e4berling et al., 2015) demonstrate that focal injury to the left angular gyrus produces finger agnosia with high specificity (approx. 85%) and sensitivity (approx. 80%). Option A (neglect) is incorrect because neglect is most commonly associated with non\u2010dominant parietal lobe lesions and is characterized by failure to attend to contralateral stimuli, not finger recognition deficits. Option C (right\u2013left disorientation), Option D (agraphia), and Option E (acalculia) are also features of Gerstmann syndrome but represent additional components; the singular most specific sign in isolation is finger agnosia (Rosenberg et al., 2002). Quantitative lesion\u2010symptom correlation (Benson et al., 1975) shows that while agraphia and acalculia occur in 70%\u201375% of cases, finger agnosia occurs in over 80%, making it the most reliable single sign. Level A evidence from neuropsychological validations supports this localization.","conceptual_foundation":"The parietal lobes integrate somatosensory information, spatial orientation, and aspects of praxis. The dominant (usually left) inferior parietal lobule, encompassing the angular and supramarginal gyri (Brodmann areas 39 and 40), subserves higher\u2010order functions: calculation, writing, finger recognition, and left\u2013right orientation. In ICD\u201011 classification, Gerstmann syndrome is categorized under G31.8 (Other specified degenerative diseases of the nervous system) when chronic, though acute lesions fall under I63 (Cerebral infarction of parietal lobe). Differential diagnoses include frontal apraxia syndromes, thalamic sensory syndromes, and primary progressive aphasia variants. Embryologically, the parietal lobe arises from the dorsal pallium; its association cortex matures in late gestation, explaining susceptibility to perinatal injuries. Neuroanatomically, the angular gyrus receives inputs from primary somatosensory cortex (areas 1\u20133), visual association cortex, and Wernicke\u2019s area via the superior longitudinal fasciculus, linking multisensory integration to language. Dominant parietal cortex is supplied by the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery, with watershed zones susceptible in systemic hypotension. At the molecular level, NMDA\u2010mediated synaptic plasticity in this region underlies praxis learning, and genetic polymorphisms in CNTNAP2 have been linked to higher\u2010order somatosensory integration variability.","pathophysiology":"Normal finger recognition depends on intact somatosensory discrimination (areas 1\u20133) projecting to the angular gyrus for higher\u2010order processing. A focal lesion disrupts this flow, leading to finger agnosia. At the cellular level, ischemia or hemorrhage induces glutamate\u2010mediated excitotoxicity, calcium influx, and dendritic spine loss in the angular gyrus (Dirnagl et al., 1999). Disruption of parietal\u2013frontal circuits via the superior longitudinal fasciculus impairs praxis and writing. Unlike neglect (non\u2010dominant parietal), finger agnosia arises when the dominant parietal association cortex is compromised. Temporal progression follows acute cytotoxic edema, then secondary inflammation and gliosis, explaining acute versus chronic deficits. Compensatory plasticity in the contralateral parietal cortex may restore partial function over months.","clinical_manifestation":"Dominant parietal lobe lesions present with Gerstmann syndrome: finger agnosia (~80% of cases), agraphia (~75%), acalculia (~70%), and right\u2013left disorientation (~65%). Patients often report difficulty identifying fingers, inability to write despite intact motor function, and errors in basic arithmetic. Prodromal features may include transient paresthesias or mild aphasia. Time course depends on etiology: stroke produces abrupt onset, tumor causes progressive deficits over weeks to months. Variants include \u2018\u2018pseudo\u2010Gerstmann\u2019\u2019 in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease with lower frequency of finger agnosia. In pediatric populations, developmental dyscalculia and dysgraphia may mimic acalculia and agraphia but lack the acute onset and finger agnosia component.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI brain with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging and FLAIR to detect parietal lesions (sensitivity >95%, specificity >90%). Neuropsychological battery focusing on tactile naming, calculation tasks, and left\u2013right orientation test (sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%). Pre-test probability rises in left MCA infarcts or parietal tumors. Second-tier: functional MRI or SPECT to assess cortical activation. Third-tier: invasive mapping in surgical cases. Avoid over-reliance on CT, which misses small parietal infarcts (sensitivity ~50%). Differential workup includes ruling out peripheral neuropathy or primary motor deficits.","management_principles":"No pharmacological agents reverse focal parietal deficits. Management is rehabilitative: occupational therapy for tactile retraining and writing exercises (Level B evidence), cognitive remediation for calculation tasks, and neuromodulation (rTMS) in research settings. Stroke guidelines (AHA/ASA 2018) recommend early initiation of task\u2010oriented therapies within 48 hours (Class I, Level A). Surgical resection for tumors follows oncologic protocols; postoperative rehabilitation mirrors stroke rehabilitation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor every 3 months with clinical and neuropsychological assessments. MRI at 3\u20136 months post-stroke to assess infarct evolution; annual imaging if tumor. Use Functional Independence Measure (FIM) to track ADL improvement. Adjust therapy intensity based on monthly gains; prolonged deficits beyond 12 months predict permanent impairment. Patient education on fall prevention and compensatory strategies is essential.","clinical_pearls":"1. Finger agnosia is the most sensitive single sign for dominant parietal lesions (80%). 2. Gerstmann syndrome requires angular gyrus involvement\u2014neglect indicates non\u2010dominant side. 3. MRI DWI is the gold standard for acute parietal infarcts (sensitivity >95%). 4. Rehabilitation should begin within 48\u2009h of stroke onset (AHA/ASA Class I). 5. Distinguish developmental dyscalculia from acquired acalculia\u2014check for finger agnosia.","references":"1.
