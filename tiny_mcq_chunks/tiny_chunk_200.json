Option A, oophorectomy, is correct because it allows definitive histopathologic diagnosis and removal of potentially malignant tissue. Option B, chemotherapy, is administered post-operatively if malignancy is confirmed and based on staging; it is not primary treatment for an ultrasound-detected ovarian mass. Option C, radiation therapy, is not standard for ovarian tumors due to poor penetration and high toxicity in the pelvis. In contrast, oophorectomy provides tissue diagnosis and is the accepted initial management (AAGL practice guidelines 2017).","conceptual_foundation":"Ovarian neoplasms are classified by cell type (epithelial, germ cell, sex cord\u2013stromal). Imaging findings suspicious for neoplasia\u2014solid components, septations, papillary projections\u2014warrant surgical evaluation. The ICD-11 classifies malignant ovarian tumors under neoplasm codes. Differential diagnoses include benign cysts, endometriomas, and metastatic disease.","pathophysiology":"The ovary may develop neoplastic growths from surface epithelium (serous, mucinous), germ cells (dysgerminoma), or stromal cells (granulosa cell tumor). Malignant transformation involves genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1/2, TP53), leading to uncontrolled proliferation and potential peritoneal spread. Surgical removal interrupts this process by excising the tumor mass.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with ovarian tumors may be asymptomatic or present with pelvic pain, bloating, early satiety, or menstrual irregularities. Palpable adnexal mass may be detected on examination. Acute torsion or rupture can present with severe pain.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes transvaginal ultrasound, CA-125 levels, and risk assessment tools (e.g., Risk of Malignancy Index). MRI may further characterize complex masses. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathology obtained at surgery.","management_principles":"First-tier management is surgical staging and removal\u2014unilateral oophorectomy for suspicious masses in premenopausal women, bilateral with hysterectomy in postmenopausal or high-risk cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy is based on tumor type and stage. Radiation is rarely used.","follow_up_guidelines":"Surveillance post-oophorectomy includes periodic pelvic exams, imaging, and tumor marker monitoring per NCCN guidelines. Follow-up intervals depend on histologic grade and stage.","clinical_pearls":"1. Any complex adnexal mass in a postmenopausal woman warrants surgical evaluation. 2. CA-125 is elevated in many benign conditions; interpret with imaging. 3. Ovarian preservation may be considered in young patients with benign tumors. 4. Tumor rupture during surgery upstages disease. 5. Germ cell tumors respond well to platinum-based chemotherapy.","references":"1. AAGL practice guidelines for the management of ovarian tumors.

In suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) presenting with urinary incontinence, cognitive impairment, and ventriculomegaly, a high-volume lumbar CSF tap test can predict shunt responsiveness. Option A (VP shunt referral) is premature without a positive tap test. Option B (levodopa trial) addresses parkinsonism but does not treat NPH. Option D (observation) delays diagnosis and therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"NPH is a form of communicating hydrocephalus characterized by the clinical triad of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence, classified under ICD-11 8A00. Historically described by Hakim and Adams in 1965, NPH differentiation from other dementias relies on ventricular enlargement out of proportion to cortical atrophy. Pathways involved include CSF absorption at arachnoid granulations and periventricular white matter tract integrity.","pathophysiology":"In NPH, impaired CSF absorption leads to gradually elevated ventricular size, stretching periventricular fibers, especially in corona radiata, leading to gait apraxia and urinary urgency via disruption of corticospinal and cortico-bulbar pathways. Chronic ventricular enlargement also disrupts frontal subcortical loops causing dysexecutive syndrome.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in the 60\u201370 age range. Gait is broad-based, magnetic, and shuffling (present in 80\u2013100%). Cognition shows frontal-subcortical impairment (bradyphrenia, executive dysfunction). Urinary urgency and incontinence occur in 50\u201380%. Without treatment, progressive deterioration over months to years ensues.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: brain MRI demonstrating Evans index >0.3 and disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH). Second-tier: lumbar tap test removing 30\u201350 mL CSF with gait assessment pre- and post-tap (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~60%). Third-tier: external lumbar drainage over 72 hours if tap test inconclusive (sensitivity ~92%, specificity ~100%).","management_principles":"Definitive treatment is VP shunting (choice of programmable valve). Class II evidence supports shunting in tap-test responders, improving gait in ~70% and cognition in ~50%. Risks include subdural hematoma (~10%) and infection (~5%). No pharmacologic therapies have proven benefit.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-shunt, assess gait, cognition, and urinary function at 1, 3, and 6 months. Adjust valve settings based on symptomatic response and imaging. Monitor for complications with CT head at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively.","clinical_pearls":"1. Triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence is hallmark. 2. Evans index >0.3 on imaging suggests ventriculomegaly. 3. High-volume tap test predicts shunt responsiveness. 4. Early shunting yields better outcomes\u2014delays reduce reversibility. 5. Programmable shunts reduce overdrainage complications.","references":"1. Relkin N et al.

Glioblastoma multiforme often demonstrates pseudopalisading necrosis\u2014rows of neoplastic astrocytes surrounding areas of necrosis. No other histologic pattern is as characteristic of a lesion crossing the corpus callosum (\u201cbutterfly glioma\u201d).","conceptual_foundation":"Tumors crossing the corpus callosum in adults are most commonly glioblastomas. Histologically, they feature marked cellular pleomorphism, microvascular proliferation, and pseudopalisading necrosis. Recognizing this pattern is central to diagnosing GBM (WHO grade IV).","pathophysiology":"Rapid tumor growth outstrips its blood supply, leading to central necrosis. Surviving tumor cells line up around the necrotic core, creating the pseudopalisading appearance. This architecture is driven by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated VEGF expression and angiogenesis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with progressive headaches, cognitive changes, and focal deficits depending on tumor location. Butterfly gliomas involving both hemispheres through the callosum produce interhemispheric disconnection syndromes and bilateral deficits.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI shows a ring-enhancing lesion crossing midline via the corpus callosum. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathology, typically via stereotactic biopsy or resection, revealing pseudopalisading necrosis on hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining.","management_principles":"Treatment includes maximal safe surgical resection, followed by concurrent radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions) with temozolomide and adjuvant temozolomide.

Histology showing a \u201cfried egg\u201d appearance is characteristic of oligodendroglioma. Multiple trials (RTOG 9402, EORTC 26951) demonstrate that maximal safe resection significantly prolongs progression-free and overall survival. Option A (Chemotherapy) and B (Radiotherapy) are adjuvant therapies post-resection. Option C (Gamma knife) is not first-line for diffuse oligodendrogliomas due to their infiltrative nature.","conceptual_foundation":"Oligodendrogliomas are diffuse, WHO grade II/III gliomas defined by IDH1/2 mutation and 1p/19q codeletion (WHO 2016/2021 classification). They account for 5\u201320% of gliomas, presenting in adults aged 30\u201350, often with seizures. Differential includes astrocytomas and mixed oligoastrocytomas (no longer recognized).","pathophysiology":"IDH1/2 mutations result in accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate, inducing global DNA hypermethylation (G-CIMP phenotype). The 1p/19q codeletion likely arises from an unbalanced translocation t(1;19)(q10;p10), conferring chemosensitivity. Tumor cells infiltrate white matter tracts, disrupting normal cortical networks and provoking seizures.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients commonly present with new-onset focal seizures (70\u201390%), headaches, and focal deficits depending on tumor location (frontal lobes > temporal/parietal). Symptom onset is insidious, over months to years, reflecting slow tumor growth.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI is the imaging modality of choice, showing a cortical, T2-hyperintense, calcified mass with minimal enhancement. Definitive diagnosis relies on histopathology (perinuclear halo \u201cfried egg\u201d cells) and molecular profiling for IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion. CT may reveal calcifications in up to 90% of cases.","management_principles":"Initial maximal safe resection correlates with improved survival (median OS ~14 years for grade II oligodendroglioma). Adjuvant radiotherapy plus PCV chemotherapy further increases progression-free survival (PFS 67 vs. 28 months; RTOG 9402). In low-risk patients (age <40, gross-total resection), observation with surveillance imaging may be considered.","follow_up_guidelines":"Perform MRI every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6\u201312 months.

A red mass is seen from the nostril, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a cystic lesion arising from the clivus. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Chordoma","Osteohestosis"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Chordoma","subspecialty":"Neuro-Oncology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct diagnosis is chordoma. Chordomas arise from notochordal remnants and typically present as destructive midline skull base lesions at the clivus, causing headache, elevated intracranial pressure with papilledema, and false localizing sixth nerve palsies. The red mass protruding into the nasal cavity reflects extension through the sphenoid sinus, a classic feature of clival chordomas. Osteohestosis is not a recognized entity in the clival region, lacks the MRI characteristics and clinical manifestations seen here, and is therefore incorrect.","conceptual_foundation":"Chordomas are rare malignant bone tumors accounting for 1\u20134 % of primary bone tumors. In ICD-11 they are coded under 2C50.27; in the WHO classification of CNS tumors they are designated \u2018\u2018chordoma\u2019\u2019. They arise from embryonic notochord remnants along the neuraxis, most commonly in the sacrococcygeal region (50 %) and clivus (35 %), with 15 % in other vertebral bodies. Differential diagnoses include chondrosarcoma, metastases, meningioma, and benign notochordal cell tumor. Historically, chordomas were first described by Virchow in 1857; the term \u2018\u2018chordoma\u2019\u2019 was coined by M\u00fcller in 1894.","pathophysiology":"Embryologically, the notochord forms the axial skeleton's central rod; remnants persist into adulthood and can undergo neoplastic transformation. Chordomas express the transcription factor brachyury, show physaliphorous (soap-bubble) cells on histology, and demonstrate destructive osteolysis by secreting matrix metalloproteinases. The slow-growing mass compresses adjacent structures, elevating intracranial pressure and causing bilateral abducens nerve stretching within Dorello's canal, yielding palsies. Vascular supply derives from the meningeal branches of the internal carotid and vertebrobasilar systems, accounting for moderate tumor vascularity.","clinical_manifestation":"Presenting symptoms include headache in 80 % of clival chordomas, diplopia due to sixth nerve palsy in 20\u201330 %, and visual disturbances. Epistaxis or nasal obstruction occurs when the tumor extends into the sphenoid sinus and nasal cavity. Papilledema reflects raised intracranial pressure. Onset is insidious, over months to years, given the indolent growth; cranial nerve deficits and brainstem compression features appear as late manifestations.","diagnostic_approach":"MRI is the gold standard: chordomas are T1-hypointense to isointense, T2-hyperintense with heterogeneous enhancement post-gadolinium. CT demonstrates bone destruction with a \u2018\u2018soap-bubble\u2019\u2019 appearance. Biopsy via transnasal endoscopic approach confirms diagnosis with physaliphorous cells staining positive for cytokeratin, S-100, and brachyury. Preoperative angiography may be used in highly vascular tumors.","management_principles":"Maximal safe surgical resection is first-line, achieved via endoscopic endonasal or combined transcranial approaches. Adjuvant high-dose proton beam or carbon ion radiotherapy (\u226570 GyE) improves local control due to chordoma radioresistance. Conventional photon radiotherapy has inferior outcomes. No effective chemotherapy exists; experimental targeted therapies against PDGFR and EGFR are under investigation.","follow_up_guidelines":"Surveillance MRI every 6 months for the first 5 years, then annually up to 10 years, is recommended (AANS/CNS 2019). Monitor for local recurrence, which occurs in up to 50 % of cases within 5 years. Consider FDG-PET if MRI findings are equivocal. Lifelong follow-up is advised due to late recurrences.","clinical_pearls":"1. False localizing sixth nerve palsy in a patient with papilledema suggests a clival lesion like chordoma. 2. Brachyury immunostaining distinguishes chordoma from chondrosarcoma. 3. Endoscopic endonasal resection minimizes morbidity and improves access to midline skull base lesions. 4. Proton beam therapy (\u226570 GyE) significantly increases 5-year local control compared to photons. 5. Epistaxis in clival tumors indicates sinus invasion and more aggressive behavior.","references":"1. Taphoorn MJB, Vecht CJ.
