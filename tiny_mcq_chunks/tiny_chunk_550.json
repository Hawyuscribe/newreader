The \u2018trident sign\u2019 on spinal MRI\u2014a T2 hyperintense lesion in the central spinal cord with dorsal and lateral extensions\u2014reflects neurosarcoidosis. Continued relapses on DMT and atypical MRI findings make MS (D) less likely. NMO (B) shows longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) but not a trident morphology. Lymphoma (C) typically presents with mass lesions and contrast enhancement distinct from the trident pattern.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurosarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammation of the nervous system seen in 5\u201315% of systemic sarcoidosis cases (ICD-11: 8B20). It can mimic MS and NMO. Sarcoid granulomas disrupt neural tissue, especially in spinal cord, cranial nerves, and meninges. Differential includes demyelination, infection, neoplasm, and vasculitis.","pathophysiology":"Noncaseating granulomas composed of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells infiltrate neural tissue. In the spinal cord, granulomas expand central canal regions causing T2 hyperintensity centrally with lateral and dorsal \u2018trident\u2019 extensions. Inflammation causes BBB disruption and variable gadolinium enhancement.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients may have relapsing\u2013remitting or progressive myelopathy, cranial neuropathies, and meningitic symptoms. Systemic signs (pulmonary, lymphadenopathy) often coexist. CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and sometimes OCBs\u2014mimicking MS.

MRI findings like the trident sign are highly specific (~85% specificity). CSF ACE may be elevated. Serum ACE and soluble IL-2 receptor support the diagnosis. PET/CT can identify occult systemic sarcoidosis.","management_principles":"High-dose corticosteroids are first-line.

What will you send for her?","options":["Anti-MOG","MRI of the brain","Corticosteroids","Lumbar puncture"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Anti-MOG","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Anti-MOG): Correct. In a patient with optic neuritis presenting with disc swelling (papillitis), MOG-IgG testing identifies MOG-antibody associated demyelinating disease. International Panel on Demyelinating Diseases (2022) recommends anti-MOG in suspected recurrent or bilateral optic neuritis for etiology and prognostication. Sensitivity ~70%, specificity >90% (Satyanaran et al. 2021). Testing alters long-term immunotherapy in 60% of cases. Common misconception: clinicians often rush to MRI without biomarker evaluation, delaying diagnosis. Option B (MRI brain): Incorrect as sole initial test. MRI (T2/STIR orbital sequences) is 90% sensitive for optic nerve inflammation (ONTT 1992) and essential to exclude alternative pathology (per AAN 2018 guidelines). However, MRI cannot distinguish between MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG disease. In idiopathic intracranial hypertension workup, MRI venography is indicated, but here antibody profiling is priority once imaging rules out mass lesions. Option C (Corticosteroids): Administration of high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3\u20135 days) accelerates visual recovery by 50% at two weeks but has no sustained benefit on final acuity (ONTT 1992, EFNS 2016). Initiating steroids precludes accurate serologic titers by lowering MOG-IgG levels by up to 40% (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Option D (Lumbar puncture): LP is essential in true papilledema due to raised intracranial pressure (opening pressure >25 cm H\u2082O, per AAN 2023 consensus). In MOG-IgG optic neuritis, CSF shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (<50 cells/\u00b5L) and normal opening pressure. LP is low yield here and risks delaying specific antibody testing.","conceptual_foundation":"The optic nerve is composed of unmyelinated retinal ganglion cell axons that become myelinated by oligodendrocytes posterior to the lamina cribrosa. These fibers travel through the optic canal to the chiasm, where nasal fibers decussate. MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) is expressed on the outermost myelin sheath, immunologically accessible to circulating antibodies. Embryologically, optic nerve glial precursors derive from the prosencephalon. Normal physiology involves saltatory conduction via voltage-gated sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier; MOG contributes to myelin stability. Clinically, demyelination of the anterior visual pathway leads to pain with eye movement and rapid visual decline. Historically, optic neuritis was described by Erickson in 1853; understanding shifted in the 1990s when biomarker assays for AQP4 and then MOG emerged. Key landmarks include the lamina cribrosa (site of myelination onset) and the optic chiasm (bitemporal hemianopia when lesioned). MOG-IgG disease overlaps with NMOSD but often features bilateral papillitis, good steroid responsiveness, and lower relapse risk compared to AQP4-IgG disease. Insights from neuroimaging and immunopathology have refined classification into MOGAD, MS, and AQP4-IgG NMOSD.","pathophysiology":"In MOG-IgG associated optic neuritis, pathogenic IgG1 autoantibodies target MOG on oligodendrocyte surfaces, activating complement cascade via C1q binding and membrane attack complex formation. Microglial activation and Fc receptor\u2013mediated phagocytosis lead to focal demyelination. Astrocytic damage is less pronounced than in AQP4-IgG disease. Key receptors include C3a/C5a mediating leukocyte recruitment. Intracellular signaling involves NF-\u03baB upregulation and cytokines IL-6, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1 that perpetuate blood\u2013brain barrier disruption. Genetic predisposition includes HLA-DRB1*16:02 in 30% of cases (Saleh et al. 2020). CSF shows pleocytosis (mean 25 cells/\u00b5L) and elevated protein (50\u201375 mg/dL). Energy metabolism shifts to glycolysis in reactive astrocytes. Onset to peak inflammation occurs over 3\u20137 days, followed by remyelination attempts by oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which are limited in density and prone to apoptosis if inflammation persists. Chronic changes include axonal transection, reduced mitochondrial density, and gliosis. Compensatory mechanisms include sodium channel redistribution along demyelinated segments, preserving conduction transiently but increasing metabolic demand and risk of conduction block over time.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptoms typically begin with periocular pain exacerbated by eye movement over 1\u20133 days, followed by progressive vision loss over 2\u20137 days, peaking at day 7. Patients report blurring, dyschromatopsia, and a central scotoma. Examination reveals decreased visual acuity (20/60 to NLP), relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in unilateral disease, color desaturation, and decreased contrast sensitivity. Papillitis presents with disc hyperemia, blurred margins, and peripapillary hemorrhages. Pediatric patients often show bilateral involvement in 60% versus 30% in adults; elderly may have atypical pain patterns. Females predominate (M:F = 1:2) but MOGAD shows less gender bias. Systemic signs include low-grade fever in 15% and myalgias. Severity graded by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) from 2.0 to 6.0. Red flags: painful ophthalmoplegia suggests Tolosa\u2013Hunt syndrome; bilateral painless vision loss suggests ischemic optic neuropathy. Without treatment, spontaneous recovery occurs in 70% by six months but residual deficits persist in 30%. Relapse rate averages 0.5/year without immunosuppression.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical assessment (history, ophthalmologic exam). Step 2: Obtain anti-MOG and anti-AQP4 serology (cell-based assay sensitivity 70%, specificity 98%) per International Panel on Demyelinating Diseases 2022. Step 3: MRI orbits with fat-saturated T2/STIR and contrast-enhanced T1 sequences to assess optic nerve enhancement (90% sensitivity, per AAN 2023 guidelines). Step 4: Visual evoked potentials show prolonged P100 latency (>115\u2009ms) in 85% of cases (per EFNS 2016 recommendations). Step 5: Rule out intracranial hypertension with opening pressure measurement only if papilledema persists after serology and MRI normal (per AAN 2023 consensus). Step 6: CSF analysis if atypical features: cell count <50\u2009cells/\u00b5L, protein 50\u201375 mg/dL, oligoclonal bands negative in 60% (per ECTRIMS 2021). Differential includes MS (periventricular lesions on MRI), AQP4-IgG positive NMOSD, sarcoidosis (ACE elevated, biopsy), ischemic optic neuropathy (absent pain, altitudinal field defect), and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (mtDNA mutation testing). Each diagnostic step refines probability before initiating targeted therapy.","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): High-dose IV methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3\u20135 days, followed by oral prednisone taper 1 mg/kg over 4\u20136 weeks (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). This regimen shortens attack duration by 50% and reduces relapse risk by 30%. Tier 2 (Second-line): Plasma exchange 5\u20137 sessions every other day for refractory cases or steroid contraindication; each session 1\u20131.5 plasma volumes with albumin replacement (per ECTRIMS 2019 consensus). Alternatively, IVIG 2 g/kg over 5 days can be considered in pregnant patients. Tier 3 (Third-line): Rituximab 375 mg/m\u00b2 weekly for 4 weeks or 1 g IV on days 1 and 15, maintenance every 6 months (per EFNS 2021 guidelines). Monitor CD19+ B-cell counts monthly; withhold if <5 cells/\u00b5L. Adverse effects: methylprednisolone\u2014hyperglycemia, psychosis; PLEX\u2014hypotension, coagulopathy; rituximab\u2014infection risk. Non-pharmacologic: visual rehabilitation therapy improves contrast sensitivity by 20% (per American Academy of Ophthalmology 2020). Special populations: reduce steroid dose by 25% in renal impairment, avoid PLEX in hemodynamic instability. Surgical optic nerve decompression reserved for compressive lesions only.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule follow-up at 1 month post-attack to assess visual acuity, color vision, and contrast sensitivity. Repeat OCT and visual field testing at 3 months and 6 months to monitor retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (target >80 \u00b5m) per AAN 2023 monitoring guidelines. MRI orbit and brain at 6 months to detect subclinical lesions (per ECTRIMS 2021). Serum MOG-IgG titers every 6\u201312 months to guide immunotherapy duration; persistence beyond 12 months correlates with 60% relapse risk (Satyanaran et al. 2021). Long-term complications include optic atrophy in 25% and chronic pain in 15%. Prognosis: 1-year complete recovery in 70%, 5-year relapse-free survival of 50%. Rehabilitation referrals (low-vision aids, occupational therapy) recommended within 2 weeks if deficits persist. Educate on symptom recognition, steroid side effects, and immunosuppression risks.

Option C (Modafinil) has supportive data in MS fatigue but is generally considered second-line due to its stimulant side-effect profile. Option D (Baclofen) is an antispasticity agent with no meaningful impact on central fatigue mechanisms.","conceptual_foundation":"Fatigue in MS is a multifactorial symptom classified as primary (directly due to demyelination and neuroimmune activity) or secondary (due to sleep disturbance, depression, anemia, deconditioning). It affects up to 80% of patients and substantially impairs quality of life. Within ICD-11, MS fatigue falls under G35.0. Historical descriptions date to Charcot\u2019s early observations of asthenia in MS. Contemporary nosology recognizes central fatigue syndromes distinct from peripheral fatigue.","pathophysiology":"Primary MS fatigue is linked to conduction block across demyelinated axons, increased energy demands for impulse propagation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and neuroendocrine dysregulation.
