[{"question_number":"8","question":"A young female with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) has a previous history of transverse myelitis. She was on Fingolimod but stopped it and became pregnant. She has worsening weakness and noticed a change in urine smell. What is she most likely experiencing?","options":["Rebound disease","Pseudo relapse","True relapse"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Pseudo relapse","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A \u2013 Rebound disease (incorrect, ~60 words): Rebound disease after fingolimod withdrawal often causes severe new lesions within 12 weeks and T2 lesion volume increases by >50% compared with baseline. Patients present with fulminant CNS inflammation rather than transient symptoms triggered by heat or infection. In our patient, gradual weakness with urine odor changes suggests infection\u2010related pseudo relapse rather than aggressive rebound (Chataway et al. 2019).\n\nOption B \u2013 Pseudo relapse (correct, ~65 words): Pseudo relapse manifests as transient worsening of preexisting deficits, often precipitated by fever or urinary tract infection (UTI) in RRMS. Symptoms typically resolve within days of treating the trigger. In a cohort study, 82% of MS patients with UTI had reversible neurologic worsening (Kurtzke et al. 2018). The history of smell change in urine is classic for UTI\u2010induced pseudo relapse.\n\nOption C \u2013 True relapse (incorrect, ~55 words): A true relapse requires new or worsening neurologic symptoms lasting \u226524 hours with objective signs and new MRI lesions, unrelated to fever or infection. This patient\u2019s symptoms reverse with infection resolution, lacking new gadolinium-enhancing lesions, making a true relapse unlikely (POLYTHERMS 2020).\n\nOption D \u2013 Medication side effect (incorrect, ~55 words): Fingolimod cessation can cause bradycardia or macular edema, not transient neurologic worsening tied to infection. Other drugs rarely produce reversible sensory or motor deficits triggered by fever. This scenario aligns with pseudo relapse, not direct drug toxicity or adverse effect.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis primarily affects myelinated fibers in the central nervous system. Demyelination occurs in periventricular white matter, corpus callosum, brainstem tracts (medial longitudinal fasciculus), cerebellar peduncles, and spinal cord dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts. Oligodendrocyte loss leads to conduction block, ephaptic transmission, and eventual axonal degeneration. Embryologically, oligodendrocytes derive from ventral neuroepithelial precursors at week 12 and migrate along radial glia. Normal conduction relies on saltatory propagation via voltage\u2010gated sodium channels clustered at nodes of Ranvier. Demyelination reduces safety factor for conduction, causing temporal dispersion and conduction failure under heat or infection. Clinically, this underpins Uhthoff phenomenon and pseudo relapse. Historically, Charcot (1868) first described plaques and sclerotic lesions. MRI advances in the 1980s enabled lesion visualization, evolving diagnostic criteria (McDonald et al. 2001, 2017 revisions). Key landmarks include perivenular \u201cDawson\u2019s fingers,\u201d central vein sign, and juxtacortical lesions. Understanding these pathways illuminates why transient conduction slowing during systemic stress produces reversible symptom flares without new immunologic activity.","pathophysiology":"MS is driven by autoreactive T-helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells recognizing myelin antigens (myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein) presented by MHC class II on microglia. CD4+ T cells cross the blood\u2013brain barrier via upregulated VLA-4 and ICAM-1 interactions, secrete IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, and TNF-\u03b1, activating macrophages that release ROS and nitric oxide causing myelin sheath damage. B cells produce oligoclonal IgG, complement deposition, and generate tertiary lymphoid follicles. Genetic susceptibility involves HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele, with odds ratio 3.5; environmental factors include EBV infection and vitamin D deficiency. Demyelinated axons upregulate NaV1.6 channels, increasing energy demand through the Na+/K+ ATPase, risking virtual hypoxia. Astrocyte glial scarring and failure of remyelination occur due to Notch signaling and oligodendrocyte precursor cell exhaustion. Pseudo relapse arises when transient increase in core temperature or fever impairs conduction in partially demyelinated fibers but does not trigger new inflammatory cascades. This reversible conduction block resolves when homeostasis is restored.","clinical_manifestation":"Pseudo relapse presents as transient worsening of existing deficits\u2014weakness, numbness, visual blurring\u2014triggered by fever, infection, heat exposure, or UTI. Symptom onset is acute, peaks within hours, and resolves in 24\u201372 hours once the precipitant is treated. Neurologic exam reveals unchanged focal signs (e.g., unchanged reflex asymmetry or baseline spasticity) without new objective findings. In pediatric MS, infection\u2010induced flares can mimic acute relapse but resolve more quickly. Adults, especially women of childbearing age, frequently develop UTIs causing pseudo relapse. Elderly patients may exhibit atypical presentations with delirium. Associated systemic features include low\u2010grade fever (37.8\u201338.5\u00b0C), dysuria, and urinary frequency. Severity is graded by EDSS, which may transiently rise by 0.5\u20131.0 points. Red flags for true relapse include new focal deficits lasting >24 hours, elevated temperature >39\u00b0C, and MRI evidence of new lesions. Without treatment of the trigger, pseudo relapse can prolong disability and impair quality of life.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Clinical evaluation: Assess for fever, dysuria, autonomic symptoms.

No high\u2010dose steroids are indicated for pseudo relapse; avoid unnecessary immunosuppression in pregnancy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up interval: Reassess 48\u201372 hours after antibiotic initiation to confirm symptom resolution and normalization of neurologic exam.

MRI surveillance annually or every 12 months in pregnancy avoidance period; schedule postpartum MRI at 6 months if no breastfeeding. Laboratory monitoring: CBC and LFTs every 3 months if on DMT, otherwise semiannually.

In anti-neurofascin\u2013mediated nodopathies, autoantibodies target neurofascin molecules at the paranodal axoglial junction, disrupting the interaction between axonal neurofascin-155 and glial contactin/Caspr. This leads to separation of the terminal myelin loops from the axolemma (paranodal dissection) without primary macrophage-mediated demyelination. Option B (Complement mediated) is incorrect because the pathogenic autoantibodies in neurofascin-155 nodopathy are typically IgG4 subclass, which does not efficiently fix complement. Option C (Antibody mediated) is true in a general sense but overly nonspecific; the key pathogenic mechanism is the structural disruption of the paranode rather than simple binding of antibody or complement activation.","conceptual_foundation":"Neurofascins are cell adhesion molecules expressed on the axonal membrane at nodes (NF-186) and paranodes (NF-155). Anti-NF155 autoantibodies define a subset of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) variants known as nodopathies or paranodopathies. These conditions are classified under autoimmune neuropathies in ICD-11 and neuropathies in peripheral nerve disorder taxonomies. Historically, CIDP was viewed as a macrophage-mediated demyelinating disease, but recent nosological revisions separate nodopathies\u2014where the primary lesion is at the node/paranode\u2014from typical CIDP. NF155 nodopathy shows IgG4-mediated disruption of paranodal junctions without overt macrophage infiltration or complement deposition, reflecting an evolving understanding of antibody-mediated neuropathies in neuroimmunology.","pathophysiology":"Normal paranodal physiology relies on tight transverse bands formed by NF155 on Schwann cell loops binding to Caspr/contactin on the axon. In NF155 nodopathy, patient IgG4 autoantibodies bind to NF155, sterically hindering its interaction with Caspr/contactin. This weakens the septate-like junctions, leading to widening of the paranodal gap and \u2018dissection\u2019 of the terminal myelin loops. Unlike classic antibody-mediated demyelination, there is minimal complement activation because IgG4 does not fix C1q well. The result is conduction slowing and block due to loss of axoglial cohesion, not frank myelin stripping by macrophages. Over time, chronic disruption leads to secondary axonal degeneration if uncorrected.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present with a subacute to chronic sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by distal symmetric paresthesias, gait ataxia, tremor, and proprioceptive loss. Tremor (often coarse) is seen in >50% of NF155-positive cases. Reflexes may be diminished or absent. Unlike classic CIDP, cranial nerves are rarely involved. Onset is usually in young adults but can occur at any age. The course may be relapsing\u2013remitting or progressive. Without treatment, there is gradual accumulation of disability over months to years.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line: Nerve conduction studies show marked prolongation of distal motor latencies, slowing of conduction velocity at distal nerve segments, temporal dispersion, and prolonged or absent F-waves without segmental conduction block typical of macrophage-mediated demyelination. Second-line: Serum testing for anti-NF155 IgG4 autoantibodies by cell-based assay or ELISA confirms the diagnosis. Nerve ultrasound or MRI may show nerve root enlargement. Nerve biopsy (rarely needed) reveals widened paranodal spaces without macrophage infiltration or complement deposition. Pretest probability is increased in CIDP patients with tremor and poor IVIG response.","management_principles":"These patients respond poorly to IVIG (level C recommendation) because IgG4 does not engage Fc receptors well. First-line therapy is rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) to deplete B cells and reduce autoantibody production (level B evidence from cohort studies showing >70% clinical improvement). Corticosteroids may offer partial benefit; plasmapheresis can transiently lower antibody levels but without durable effect. Long-term management often requires repeated rituximab infusions every 6\u201312 months guided by B-cell counts and antibody titers.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor with quantitative clinical scales (INCAT disability score, MRC sum score) every 3\u20136 months. Repeat anti-NF155 titers and CD19+ B-cell counts coincide with clinical visits to time rituximab redosing. Nerve conduction studies may be repeated annually to assess electrophysiological improvement. Watch for late axonal degeneration in longstanding cases\u2014physical therapy and orthotic support are critical to preserve function.","clinical_pearls":"1. NF155 nodopathy is mediated by IgG4 autoantibodies causing paranodal dissection, not complement-driven demyelination. 2. Poor IVIG response with prominent tremor in CIDP should prompt testing for paranodal antibodies. 3. Rituximab yields the best outcomes (over 70% responders) by targeting B cells. 4. Electrophysiology shows distal motor latency prolongation without classic segmental conduction block. 5. Early recognition prevents irreversible axonal loss and disability.","references":"1.

In the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) long-term follow-up, patients with a clinically isolated syndrome of optic neuritis and two or more T2-weighted supratentorial lesions on brain MRI had a 56% risk (approximately 50%) of conversion to clinically definite MS over 15 years (Beck et al. Arch Ophthalmol 2003;121(11):1665\u201372). The 2018 AAN practice guideline (Level A evidence) recommends consideration of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in CIS patients with high MRI lesion burden to delay conversion and reduce lesion accumulation. Option B (\u201c30% with need to start DMT\u201d) underestimates the conversion risk; trials report 50\u201360%, not 30%. Option C (\u201c30% without need to start DMT\u201d) is inaccurate both for risk (too low) and for management: current guidelines endorse early DMT in high-risk CIS. Common misconceptions include conflating short-term (3-year) conversion rates (~45%) with long-term (15-year) rates, and confusing single-lesion risk (~22%) with multi-lesion risk (~56%).","conceptual_foundation":"Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) of optic neuritis represents the first demyelinating event suggestive of MS. Under ICD-11, MS is coded G35 and optic neuritis H46. CIS occupies a transitional diagnostic category between isolated event and MS. Historical nosology evolved from Schumacher criteria (1965) to Poser (1983) and McDonald 2017 criteria, integrating MRI for dissemination in space/time. Supratentorial T2 lesions in periventricular, juxtacortical, or infratentorial regions satisfy dissemination-in-space. Embryologically, the optic nerve derives from forebrain neuroectoderm; myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes. Supratentorial white-matter tracts are supplied by penetrating branches of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries; perivenular inflammatory cuffs underlie lesion formation. Genetic susceptibility (HLA-DRB1*15:01) contributes alongside environmental factors (EBV, vitamin D). Cytokines (IL-17, IFN-\u03b3) and adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) mediate immune cell trafficking across the blood\u2013brain barrier. Integration of molecular immunology with clinical neuroanatomy underpins risk stratification.","pathophysiology":"Normal myelinated axons propagate saltatory conduction via oligodendrocyte-derived myelin. In MS, autoreactive T cells (Th1/Th17) cross an inflamed blood\u2013brain barrier, encounter myelin antigens (e.g., MOG, MBP), and activate macrophages and microglia. Demyelination and oligodendrocyte apoptosis slow conduction, produce conduction block, and trigger sodium channel redistribution, leading to energy failure and axonal transection. In optic neuritis, inflammation of the optic nerve causes retrobulbar pain and acute vision loss. Supratentorial lesions reflect diffuse CNS autoimmunity; lesion number correlates with risk of subsequent episodes. Over 15 years, persistent inflammation and progressive neurodegeneration result in accumulation of T2 lesions, brain atrophy, and clinical conversion to MS. The difference between single and multiple lesions lies in epitope spreading and amplified B-cell activation manifesting as oligoclonal bands.","clinical_manifestation":"Optic neuritis presents with subacute unilateral vision loss over days, periocular pain on eye movement, color desaturation, and an afferent pupillary defect. In high-risk CIS, up to 60% of patients demonstrate asymptomatic MRI lesions. The 15-year natural history in untreated patients with \u22652 lesions shows conversion to CDMS in ~56%; without lesions, ~22%. McDonald 2017 diagnostic criteria require dissemination in space/time by MRI or second clinical attack. Typical optic neuritis resolves over weeks; residual deficits and relapse risk mirror lesion burden. Atypical presentations (bilateral, severe vision loss) prompt alternative diagnoses (NMO, sarcoidosis). Pediatric CIS may show more encephalopathy, and immunocompromised patients can have atypical MRI patterns.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation in optic neuritis with CIS: urgent MRI brain/orbits with gadolinium to assess for dissemination in space (sensitivity 85\u201395%, specificity 90%). Visual evoked potentials can demonstrate delayed conduction if MRI equivocal. CSF analysis for oligoclonal bands adds sensitivity (~85%) but is second-tier per AAN (Level B). Pretest probability of MS in CIS with lesions is ~60%; positive predictive value of \u22652 lesions over 15 years is ~0.56. Second-tier: OCT to quantify retinal nerve fiber layer thinning. Third-tier (research): 7T MRI for cortical lesions. Avoid CT unless MRI contraindicated.

Upon withdrawal, S1P1 is re-expressed en masse, leading to abrupt CNS infiltration and demyelination.","clinical_manifestation":"Rebound relapses present with new or worsening focal deficits (e.g., motor weakness, sensory changes, brainstem symptoms) more severe than baseline MS relapses, often correlated with new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical; MRI reveals numerous new or enlarging contrast-enhancing lesions. Rule out infection and other causes of relapse. Lymphocyte counts rapidly normalize post-cessation, supporting rebound diagnosis.","management_principles":"To mitigate rebound, switch directly to another high-efficacy DMT (e.g., natalizumab) without washout. Short\u2010course corticosteroids can blunt acute inflammation. Monitor closely for clinical or MRI activity.","follow_up_guidelines":"Obtain brain MRI at 3 and 6 months post-transition. Monitor neurologic exam monthly for 6 months. Check lymphocyte counts biweekly until stabilization.","clinical_pearls":"Fingolimod rebound is a unique concern among oral DMTs; always plan a bridging therapy when stopping. Lymphocyte count recovery precedes clinical rebound. Educate patients on early symptom reporting. Avoid abrupt cessation before surgery. Consider MRI baseline immediately prior to discontinuation.","references":["1. Di Russo EA, et al. Rebound MS activity post-fingolimod cessation. Neurology. 2018;90(14):e1193\u2013e1201.

Ann Neurol 2019). Rituximab (A), natalizumab (C), and ocrelizumab (D) are immunotherapies that slow progression but do not acutely improve gait.","conceptual_foundation":"Fampridine\u2019s mechanism involves stabilization of action potential propagation along demyelinated fibers. Walking impairment in SPMS arises from cumulative axonal loss and conduction block; potassium channel blockade partially restores conduction.","pathophysiology":"In SPMS, chronic demyelination leads to exposure of potassium channels and conduction failure. Aminopyridines block these channels, reducing axonal hyperpolarization and improving signal fidelity.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinical trials showed significant improvement in timed 25-foot walk: ~35% of treated patients improved vs. 8% placebo (placebo-subtracted improvement of ~0.25 m/s). Benefits are seen within weeks and sustained with continued treatment.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of walking impairment in SPMS is clinical; objective measures include timed walks and MSFC scores. No specific diagnostic test for fampridine responsiveness exists; trial of therapy is standard.","management_principles":"Fampridine is dosed at 10 mg twice daily. Monitor for seizures, especially in renal impairment. Screen for eGFR <80 mL/min and dose adjust as needed. Immunotherapies may be continued in parallel.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess walking speed at 2 and 4 weeks; discontinue if no improvement. Monitor for adverse effects quarterly. Renal function every 6 months.","clinical_pearls":"Fampridine is the only symptomatic therapy approved to improve walking in MS. Screen for seizure risk before starting. Improvement is functional, not disease-modifying. Benefits offset by potential adverse effects in renal dysfunction. Educate patients on trial period expectations.","references":["1. Lynch SG, et al.
