[{"question_number":"4","question":"A female patient had a seizure at the mall, described as a temporal lobe seizure. What is the recommended next step?","options":["Refer to surgery","Start antiepileptic medication","Perform an EEG","Conduct a CT scan"],"subspecialty":"Epilepsy","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Promotion","correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Perform an EEG","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Refer to surgery): In a newly presenting temporal lobe seizure, immediate surgical referral without confirmatory studies is premature. Resective surgery is reserved only after comprehensive workup including EEG, MRI, and often video\u2010EEG monitoring to localize seizure focus. In refractory cases (20\u201330% drug\u2010resistant), surgery may be indicated, but not as an initial step. Option B (Start antiepileptic medication): While starting an antiepileptic drug (AED) may seem logical, guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend obtaining diagnostic EEG prior to initiating chronic therapy in a first\u2010time unprovoked seizure, to distinguish focal epilepsy from generalized or acute symptomatic seizures. Empirical initiation risks unnecessary medication in cases without epileptiform discharges. Option C (Perform an EEG): Correct. EEG has a sensitivity of 60\u201370% for interictal epileptiform discharges in temporal lobe epilepsy on routine recording, rising to 80\u201390% with sleep\u2010deprived or prolonged monitoring. Early EEG guides classification, prognosticates recurrence risk (up to 40\u201350% if epileptiform discharges present), and directs management decisions. Pathophysiologically, epileptiform spikes reflect hyperexcitable cortical networks in hippocampal and mesial temporal structures. Misconception often arises from overvaluing CT or immediate pharmacotherapy without functional localization. Option D (Conduct a CT scan): Noncontrast CT has low yield (<5% detection of mesial temporal sclerosis) and poor sensitivity for hippocampal abnormalities. MRI is preferred for structural evaluation, but EEG remains the first diagnostic modality for characterizing seizure type and focus according to ILAE guidelines (2017).","conceptual_foundation":"The temporal lobe houses the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and lateral neocortex. These regions are interconnected via the perforant path, fornix, and uncinate fasciculus. Embryologically, the hippocampus derives from the medial pallium around gestational weeks 8\u201312, while neocortical areas arise from lateral pallial neuroepithelium. Normal physiology involves temporal lobe structures in memory consolidation, emotional processing, and auditory integration. The hippocampal pyramidal cells rely on balanced glutamatergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition, regulated by interneuron subtypes (parvalbumin-positive basket cells). Dysfunction in inhibitory networks can precipitate focal seizures manifesting with d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, olfactory hallucinations, or behavioral arrest. Mesial temporal sclerosis, characterized by hippocampal neuron loss and gliosis, is a classic epileptogenic lesion. Historically, Hughlings Jackson first described focal seizures in the 19th century, and Penfield later mapped temporal lobe epileptogenic zones in the 20th century using cortical stimulation. Key landmarks include the collateral sulcus, hippocampal head at the choroidal fissure, and temporoparietal junction, which guide surgical resection boundaries and electrode placement during intracranial monitoring.","pathophysiology":"Temporal lobe epilepsy arises from hyperexcitable neuronal networks, often due to loss of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons and sprouting of excitatory mossy fibers in the dentate gyrus. Molecularly, upregulation of NMDA receptor subunits (NR2B) and increased AMPA receptor trafficking contribute to excitotoxicity. Voltage-gated sodium channels (SCN1A, SCN2A) mutations have been implicated in familial focal epilepsy syndromes, altering channel kinetics and neuronal firing thresholds. The TSC1/TSC2 mTOR pathway dysregulation in tuberous sclerosis complex also leads to focal cortical dysplasia and seizures. Inflammatory mediators like IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 increase blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, promoting astrocytic scar formation and gliosis. Metabolically, epileptogenic regions show reduced glucose uptake on PET by 10\u201320% interictally, indicating energy deficits. Over weeks to months post\u2013insult (e.g., febrile seizures), secondary epileptogenesis occurs through synaptic reorganization. Compensatory upregulation of KCC2 chloride transporters attempts to restore GABAergic inhibition, but often fails under persistent excitatory drive, leading to recurrent seizures and kindling phenomena.","clinical_manifestation":"Temporal lobe seizures typically begin with an aura\u2014subjective sensations such as d\u00e9j\u00e1 vu (reported in 65% of cases), epigastric rising, or olfactory hallucinations. This lasts seconds before progression to automatisms (lip smacking, manual fiddling) and impaired awareness. Events peak within 30\u201360 seconds then terminate, followed by a postictal state of confusion lasting 2\u20135 minutes. Neurological exam between seizures is often normal, but interictal neuropsychological testing can reveal lateralizing deficits: verbal memory impairment in left temporal foci, visuospatial issues in right. Pediatric presentations may include regression of language or developmental plateau. Elderly patients often report new-onset psychiatric symptoms. Women with temporal lobe epilepsy have higher rates of comorbid depression (30% vs 16% general population). Systemic signs such as tachycardia (heart rate increase by 20\u201330 bpm) can occur peri-ictally. Severity is graded by seizure frequency: controlled (<1/year), moderate (1\u201312/year), and refractory (>12/year). Without treatment, approximately 60% will experience recurrence within two years, and repeated seizures can lead to hippocampal sclerosis.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Obtain a detailed history and perform neurological exam. Step 2: Routine EEG (sensitivity 60\u201370%, specificity 80\u201390% for focal discharges) should be recorded for at least 20 minutes, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation. If normal or inconclusive, proceed to sleep\u2010deprived EEG or prolonged video\u2010EEG monitoring (inpatient telemetry) where yield increases to 85\u201390%. Step 3: Brain MRI with epilepsy protocol (1.5\u20133 Tesla, coronal T2, FLAIR, volumetric T1 sequences) detects mesial temporal sclerosis in up to 70% of cases. CT is reserved for acute head trauma or suspected hemorrhage. Step 4: Laboratory tests: electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium within normal ranges (Na 135\u2013145 mEq/L, glucose 70\u2013100 mg/dL). Step 5: If autoimmune epilepsy suspected, CSF analysis (cell count <5/\u03bcL, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL, oligoclonal bands) and antibody panels. Step 6: Neuropsychological testing for memory and language lateralization. Differential includes syncope, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES with normal EEG). Intracranial EEG (depth electrodes, subdural grids) is considered when noninvasive studies conflict or for surgical planning.","management_principles":"First\u2010line therapy for focal seizures includes carbamazepine initiated at 200 mg twice daily, increasing by 200 mg every week to a typical maintenance dose of 800\u20131200 mg/day (4\u20138 mg/kg/day). Alternatively, lamotrigine can be started at 25 mg daily, titrated by 25 mg every two weeks to 100\u2013200 mg/day, especially in women of childbearing age. Loading dose of levetiracetam (20 mg/kg IV) may be used acutely, followed by 500 mg twice daily. Second-line agents include oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and lacosamide with specific dosing guidelines. Monitor hepatic enzymes and blood counts every three months for enzyme\u2010inducing AEDs. Avoid enzyme inducers in hepatic impairment. Nonpharmacological options include vagus nerve stimulation (20\u201330% reduction in seizure frequency) and ketogenic diet (for refractory pediatric cases, achieving seizure reduction in 40\u201350%). Surgical resection (anterior temporal lobectomy) demonstrates seizure freedom rates of 60\u201380% in mesial temporal sclerosis. Preoperative evaluation includes Wada testing for language lateralization. Address drug interactions (e.g., carbamazepine lowers oral contraceptive levels by 50%), and manage side effects like hyponatremia.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits should occur every 4\u20138 weeks during titration and every 3\u20136 months once stable. Monitor seizure diaries, review medication adherence, and assess for adverse events such as rash or cognitive slowing. Conduct therapeutic drug monitoring: maintain carbamazepine levels between 4\u201312 \u00b5g/mL, levetiracetam 12\u201346 \u00b5g/mL. Repeat MRI at one to two years if new symptoms arise. Annual neuropsychological assessment for memory and mood changes is recommended. Long-term complications include osteopenia (30% incidence with enzyme inducers) and depression (lifetime risk 30\u201350%). Prognosis: 1-year remission achieved in 60\u201370%, 5-year in 50%. Rehabilitation referral (occupational therapy) may be needed for cognitive deficits. Educate patients on seizure first aid, medication side effects, and avoiding seizure triggers such as sleep deprivation. Restrict driving until seizure-free for at least six months per local regulations. Provide resources: Epilepsy Foundation and local support groups for ongoing psychosocial support.","clinical_pearls":"1. Routine EEG first: 60\u201370% sensitivity for focal spikes; sleep-deprived EEG raises sensitivity to 80\u201390%. 2. Temporal lobe seizures often start with olfactory or epigastric auras; automatisms follow. 3. Mesial temporal sclerosis is best seen on coronal FLAIR MRI (70% detection rate). 4.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Infantile spasm","Severe myoclonus of infancy"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Infantile spasm","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A. Infantile spasms, or West syndrome, are characterized by clusters of brief, symmetric flexor, extensor, or mixed spasms predominantly occurring upon awakening, accompanied by a chaotic, high-amplitude EEG pattern known as hypsarrhythmia (Lux et al., N Engl J Med 2005;352(8):756\u2013764). Option B, \u201cSevere myoclonus of infancy,\u201d is not a recognized electroclinical syndrome and does not present with hypsarrhythmia. The presence of hypsarrhythmia on EEG and atonic/tonic spasms in a 9-month-old with developmental delay confirms the diagnosis of infantile spasms.","conceptual_foundation":"Infantile spasms (IS) are an epileptic encephalopathy typically presenting between 3 and 12 months of age, defined by the triad of epileptic spasms, hypsarrhythmia on EEG, and developmental arrest or regression (West 1841; Lux et al., N Engl J Med 2005;352:756\u2013764). In ICD-11, West syndrome is coded under 8A60.1. Differential diagnoses include myoclonic seizures, epileptic spasms of other etiologies, and benign infantile spasms. Genetic mutations (ARX, CDKL5) and structural causes (tuberous sclerosis complex) are common underlying etiologies. Early recognition is critical to prevent cognitive decline.","pathophysiology":"Hypsarrhythmia arises from diffuse, disorganized cortical and subcortical neuronal networks, with asynchronous slow waves and multifocal spikes. The pathogenesis involves dysfunction of GABAergic interneurons, excessive excitatory glutamatergic activity, and aberrant maturation of cortical circuits. ACTH deficiency and dysregulation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis may contribute. Genetic mutations affecting neuronal migration and synaptic regulation further disrupt cortical synchronization, resulting in the characteristic spasms and EEG pattern.","clinical_manifestation":"Infantile spasms present as sudden, brief (1\u20132\u2009s) axial muscle contractions, often in clusters of 5\u201320 spasms, typically on awakening. Patients exhibit developmental arrest or regression, irritability, and poor eye contact. The incidence is ~2\u20135 per 10,000 live births. Prognosis correlates with etiology: cryptogenic cases have better cognitive outcomes, whereas symptomatic cases (e.g., tuberous sclerosis) carry high risk of subsequent epilepsy and intellectual disability.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: awake and sleep EEG demonstrating hypsarrhythmia (high-amplitude multifocal spikes and slow waves) with electroclinical correlation of spasms. MRI brain with epilepsy protocol to identify structural etiologies (e.g., tubers, cortical malformations). Second-tier: metabolic and genetic testing (e.g., TORCH screening, chromosomal microarray, targeted gene panels). Third-tier: PET for focal cortical dysplasia, ultra-high-field MRI. Sensitivity of MRI for TSC is ~90% when performed with epilepsy protocol; EEG sensitivity for hypsarrhythmia is ~95%.","management_principles":"First-line treatment per AAN/AES guidelines is hormonal therapy (ACTH 150 U/m2/day IM for 2\u2009weeks then taper) or high-dose oral prednisolone (4\u20138\u2009mg/kg/day) (Lux et al., N Engl J Med 2005;352:756\u2013764). Vigabatrin (50\u2013150\u2009mg/kg/day) is preferred in TSC-associated IS (Level A). Combined hormonal plus vigabatrin therapy may improve response rates. Early treatment (within 2 weeks of onset) correlates with better developmental outcomes. Other ASMs (topiramate, pyridoxine) are second-line; ketogenic diet and epilepsy surgery (corpus callosotomy) are reserved for refractory cases.","follow_up_guidelines":"EEG should be repeated 2\u2009weeks after treatment initiation to assess resolution of hypsarrhythmia. Developmental assessments at 3- and 6-month intervals monitor cognitive recovery. MRI should be repeated annually in symptomatic cases. Monitor for ACTH side effects (hypertension, infection risk).
