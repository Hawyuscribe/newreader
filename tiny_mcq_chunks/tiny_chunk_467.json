[{"question_number":"1","question":"This is a 70-year-old female with a history of short-term memory impairment, long-term memory not affected, and depression with withdrawal from people. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows low amyloid and positive TUA. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)","Alzheimer's Disease (AD)","Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)","Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD)"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Alzheimer's Disease (AD)","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option B is correct. In Alzheimer's Disease, CSF typically demonstrates reduced amyloid-\u03b242 levels and elevated total tau (TUA) and phosphorylated tau, reflecting plaque deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation (Jack et al. 2018, Level A). Frontotemporal dementia (Option A) usually shows normal amyloid-\u03b2 and tau levels and presents with early behavioral changes rather than isolated short-term memory impairment. Dementia with Lewy bodies (Option C) often features visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and fluctuating cognition, and CSF biomarkers do not show the low amyloid/high tau pattern typical of AD. Corticobasal degeneration (Option D) presents with asymmetric rigidity, apraxia, and cortical sensory loss, with no characteristic CSF amyloid/tau profile. The classic biomarker pattern in CSF (low amyloid-\u03b242 sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%; elevated tau sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~88%) strongly supports AD (Hampel et al. 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Alzheimer's Disease is the most common cause of dementia worldwide (ICD-11 6A00) and is characterized by insidious onset of episodic memory loss due to hippocampal involvement. The neuropathological hallmarks\u2014extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and intraneuronal tau tangles\u2014are reflected in CSF markers. Differential diagnoses include other neurodegenerative dementias such as FTD (ICD-11 6C71), DLB (6D40), and CBD (6C72). The NIA-AA 2018 research framework redefines AD biologically, emphasizing amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (ATN) biomarkers. Embryologically, the hippocampus arises from the archicortex, while the neocortex (affected later in AD) originates from the pallium. Neuroanatomically, AD targets the medial temporal lobe, spreading to parietal and frontal cortices; cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert also degenerate. Key genetic risk factors include APOE \u03b54 (OR ~3 for heterozygotes, ~12 for homozygotes) and rare autosomal dominant mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2. The spectrum of AD ranges from preclinical biomarker positivity to mild cognitive impairment and overt dementia.","pathophysiology":"Normal synaptic function and long-term potentiation in the hippocampus depend on balanced amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and tau phosphorylation. In AD, \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP generates A\u03b242 peptides that oligomerize, impair synaptic transmission, and activate microglial inflammatory cascades via the NLRP3 inflammasome. Hyperphosphorylated tau detaches from microtubules, leading to cytoskeletal collapse and neuronal death. Early synaptic dysfunction manifests as episodic memory deficits; later, widespread neuronal loss causes global cognitive decline. Compensatory synaptic sprouting delays symptom onset until pathology is advanced (Braak stages I\u2013II). Genetic factors (e.g., APOE \u03b54) modulate A\u03b2 clearance and tau aggregation rates. Unlike FTD where TDP-43 or tau isoforms drive pathology, AD pathology is defined by A\u03b2 and paired helical filament tau. The temporal progression from preclinical biomarker changes to clinical AD follows a 10\u201315-year preclinical phase, then a prodromal MCI phase, and eventually dementia.","clinical_manifestation":"AD typically presents in patients over 65 with progressive short-term memory impairment (initially difficulty learning new information) while long-term memories remain intact early on. Around 60\u201370% of cases begin with amnestic presentations; other variants include posterior cortical atrophy and logopenic aphasia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, apathy) occur in ~40% and may precede cognitive deficits. Over 1\u20133 years cognitive decline becomes global, affecting language, visuospatial skills, and executive function. Late-stage symptoms include wandering, incontinence, and total dependence. Without treatment, median survival is 8\u201310 years after diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria (NIA-AA 2011/2018) require insidious onset, documented decline, and exclusion of other causes; CSF biomarkers increase diagnostic accuracy by >20%. In special populations, early-onset AD (<65) often has a stronger genetic component; comorbid vascular disease can accelerate progression.","diagnostic_approach":"Per AAN and NIA-AA guidelines, evaluation begins with detailed history, cognitive testing (MMSE, MoCA), and neuroimaging (MRI preferred over CT to assess atrophy patterns). CSF biomarkers (amyloid-\u03b242, total tau, p-tau181) are first-tier in atypical or early\u2010onset cases (sensitivity ~85\u201390%, specificity ~80\u201390%). PET imaging (amyloid and tau ligands) is second\u2010tier when CSF is inconclusive or unavailable. Genetic testing for autosomal dominant mutations is recommended in familial early-onset AD. Blood biomarkers (plasma p-tau217) are emerging with sensitivity/specificity >85% but not yet standard. EEG and metabolic screens rule out reversible causes. Diagnostic challenges include mixed pathologies and comorbidities.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) with Class I evidence for mild-moderate AD, improving cognition by ~2\u20133 points on ADAS-Cog at 6 months (NNT ~6). Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is indicated in moderate-severe AD (MMSE \u226414), offering small functional benefits (NNT ~12). Combination therapy may be used synergistically. Emerging therapies targeting amyloid (aducanumab, lecanemab) have accelerated FDA approval but remain controversial due to marginal clinical benefit and ARIA risk. Nonpharmacologic interventions include cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, and caregiver education. Safety considerations include monitoring for bradycardia (AChEIs) and ARIA (monoclonal antibodies). Special considerations: adjust dosing in hepatic impairment; memantine safe in renal disease with dose reduction.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor cognitive function (MMSE or MoCA) every 6\u201312 months; assess ADL scales and neuropsychiatric inventory at each visit. Routine labs (CBC, LFTs) every 6 months when on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. MRI every 2\u20133 years or sooner if rapid decline or atypical features. Educate caregivers on warning signs (rapid deterioration, new focal deficits). Long-term planning includes advanced directives and safety planning. Prognostic factors: younger age at onset and presence of vascular comorbidity predict faster decline. Transition to palliative care when MMSE <10 or severe functional impairment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Low CSF amyloid-\u03b242 with elevated tau confirms AD biomarkers (high diagnostic yield in MCI). 2. First\u2010line treatment: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors\u2014monitor for GI and cardiac side effects. 3. APOE \u03b54 homozygosity increases risk and lowers age of onset; consider genetic counseling. 4. Mixed vascular-Alzheimer pathology is common; control vascular risk factors to slow progression. 5. Emerging blood tests (plasma p-tau217) may soon replace CSF in screening.","references":"1. Jack CR Jr et al. 2018. NIA-AA Research Framework: Toward a biological definition of Alzheimer's disease.

Patients often present at ages 50\u201365 with insidious onset of poor judgment, compulsivity, and sexual inappropriateness. FTD accounts for 5\u201310% of all dementias and nearly 20% of early\u2010onset cases. Neuroimaging reveals predominant frontal and anterior temporal atrophy. Pathologically, tau or TDP\u201043 protein inclusions drive neuronal loss in orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, explaining the clinical syndrome. Option B (Alzheimer\u2019s disease): AD typically manifests with insidious anterograde amnesia, visuospatial deficits, and progressive memory impairment; behavioral symptoms like disinhibition appear late. AD prevalence is 60\u201370% of dementias in the elderly, average onset >65, MMSE declines by 2\u20134 points/year. Option C (Lewy body dementia): LBD presents with fluctuating cognition, well\u2010formed visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and REM sleep behavior disorder (70% of cases). Disinhibition without hallucinations is atypical. Option D (Vascular dementia): Vascular dementia has a stepwise decline, focal deficits, and neuroimaging evidence of infarcts or white matter disease. Behavioral disinhibition can occur but usually accompanies prominent gait disturbances or focal weakness. Common misconceptions include over\u2010reliance on mild MMSE scores; an MMSE of 28/30 often misleads clinicians away from dementia diagnosis. In FTD, MMSE may remain near normal (85% of cases early on). Studies show up to 30% of early FTD are misdiagnosed as psychiatric disorders, underscoring the need for detailed behavioral history and imaging.","conceptual_foundation":"Frontotemporal dementia primarily affects the frontal lobes (orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate) and anterior temporal lobes. These regions derive embryologically from the telencephalon, with neuronal migration peaking at gestational weeks 12\u201320. The orbitofrontal cortex modulates social behavior, impulse control, and reward processing via connections to the ventral striatum and limbic structures. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mediates executive functions, working memory, and planning through dorsal networks. Anterior temporal lobes support semantic processing and emotional recognition. Normal regulation involves glutamatergic pyramidal neurons modulating GABAergic interneurons; cholinergic input from the nucleus basalis of Meynert sustains cortical arousal. Historically, Arnold Pick first described focal frontal atrophy in 1892; the term Pick\u2019s disease originally referred to tau pathology. In the 1990s, the concept expanded to include TDP\u201043 and FUS proteinopathies under the FTD umbrella. Related syndromes include behavioral variant FTD, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, and nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia. Clinically significant anatomical landmarks include the sylvian fissure (demarcating frontal from temporal lobes), the uncinate fasciculus (connecting orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole), and the anterior commissure (interhemispheric temporal connections). Recognition of asymmetric atrophy patterns on MRI aids localization and subtype classification.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, FTD is driven by misfolded protein aggregation\u2014either tau (MAPT gene on chromosome 17q21) or TAR DNA\u2010binding protein 43 (TDP\u201043) encoded by TARDBP on chromosome 1p36.1. Approximately 10\u201320% of familial FTD is linked to progranulin (GRN) mutations on chromosome 17q21; these cause haploinsufficiency and elevated neuroinflammation via microglial activation and cytokine release (IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1). C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansions on chromosome 9p21 explain up to 25% of familial cases and produce toxic dipeptide repeats. Misfolded proteins impair ubiquitin\u2010proteasome systems and autophagy, leading to neuronal stress. Mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP production (20\u201330% lower in affected neurons) compromise synaptic transmission. Early compensatory mechanisms include synaptic sprouting and increased dendritic spine density in adjacent regions, delaying symptom onset by up to 2 years. Ion channel dysregulation involves decreased Kv4.2 expression, altering neuronal excitability. Over months to years, progressive neuronal loss in prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices results in gliosis, cortical thinning (up to 25% reduction in volume), and network disintegration affecting default mode and salience networks. Inflammatory microglial response persists but fails to clear aggregates, exacerbating neurodegeneration. Tauopathy subtypes (3\u2010repeat versus 4\u2010repeat tau) dictate the rate of progression, with 4\u2010repeat variants often more aggressive (median survival 5 years versus 8 years for 3\u2010repeat).","clinical_manifestation":"Behavioral variant FTD typically presents between ages 50 and 65 with insidious onset of personality change. Initial symptoms include disinhibition (in 60\u201380% of cases), apathy (50\u201370%), compulsive behaviors (30\u201350%), and dietary changes such as hyperorality in 30%. Symptom timeline: Year 1\u20132 mild behavioral shifts, Year 3\u20134 peak disinhibition, Year 5+ progressive akinetic mutism. Neurological exam reveals frontal release signs: palmomental reflex (~40%), grasp reflex (~35%), and glabellar tap (~45%). Executive dysfunction manifests on testing as impaired set\u2010shifting (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test errors increase by 50%) and decreased verbal fluency (20-word drop on letter fluency norm). Memory recall and visuospatial skills remain intact until moderate stages. Age variations: pediatric-onset FTD is rare (<5%), often linked to GRN mutations; elderly-onset (>75) displays slower progression. Gender differences are minimal, though men may exhibit more pronounced disinhibition. Systemic features include mild autonomic instability in C9orf72 carriers. Severity scales: Clinical Dementia Rating plus National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center FTD module (CDR\u2010FTLD) grades from 0.5 to 3. Red flags: rapid weight loss, seizures, or focal motor signs suggest alternative pathology. Without treatment, median survival is 6\u20138 years, with gradual loss of independence and emergence of parkinsonism in 30% of cases by Year 4.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Comprehensive history and neurobehavioral exam: rule out psychiatric mimics and systemic causes per AAN 2021 guidelines. 2.

This has affected his activities of daily living (ADLs), but he is doing well at work. This presentation is suggestive of:","options":["Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)","Dementia"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Dementia","subspecialty":"Dementia","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is option B: Dementia. The defining criterion that distinguishes dementia from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental ADLs (IADLs). In this scenario, the patient\u2019s cognitive deficits\u2014specifically misplacing the bank ATM card and requiring a replacement\u2014have begun to affect his ability to perform complex tasks independently. Even though occupational performance remains intact, IADL impairment (managing finances/key tasks) meets DSM-5 criteria for major neurocognitive disorder (dementia). Option A (MCI) requires preserved independence in daily activities; since the patient has demonstrable functional decline, MCI is not correct.","conceptual_foundation":"DSM-5 classifies neurocognitive disorders into mild and major. Major neurocognitive disorder requires significant cognitive decline in one or more domains and interference with independence. The International Working Group defines MCI as objective cognitive impairment without functional decline. Historically, terms evolved from benign senescent forgetfulness to MCI in the 1990s, acknowledging a prodromal stage of dementia.","pathophysiology":"Dementia syndromes involve progressive neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction in cortical and subcortical circuits, often due to Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid plaques, tau tangles), vascular changes, or Lewy bodies. Cognitive test deficits correlate with regional atrophy (e.g., hippocampal volume loss in memory impairment). Functional decline emerges when network integration fails.","clinical_manifestation":"Dementia presents with cognitive domain impairments\u2014memory, executive function, language, visuospatial skills\u2014with IADL decline such as managing finances, medications, transportation. Early vocational performance may be maintained despite IADL deficits. The progression is insidious, over months to years.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnostic work-up includes MoCA or MMSE, assessment of ADLs/IADLs (e.g., Lawton IADL scale), and neuroimaging (MRI) to exclude structural causes. Laboratory tests rule out reversible causes. Neuropsychological testing quantifies domain deficits.","management_principles":"Management involves cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine) for Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, memantine for moderate-severe cases, and supportive interventions. IADL support and caregiver education are crucial. Routine follow-up for medication efficacy and side effects is required.","follow_up_guidelines":"Reassess cognition and ADLs every 6 months, monitor for behavioral changes, adjust medications. Neuropsychiatric Inventory can track behavioral symptoms.","clinical_pearls":"1. IADL impairment distinguishes dementia from MCI. 2. Occupational performance may remain initially despite IADL decline. 3. MCI carries a ~10\u201315% annual risk of progression to dementia. 4. ADL scales (Lawton/Brody) are essential. 5. Early detection allows timely intervention.","references":"1. American Psychiatric Association. DSM-5. 2013. 2. Petersen RC et al. Mild cognitive impairment: clinical characterization and outcome.
