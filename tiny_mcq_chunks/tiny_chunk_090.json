What is the method of prevention?","options":["Aspirin","Plavix","Chronic transfusion","Dual antiplatelet therapy"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Chronic transfusion","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: Chronic transfusion. Evidence from the landmark STOP trial (Adams et al., 1998) demonstrated that regular red blood cell transfusions in children with sickle cell disease and elevated transcranial Doppler velocities reduced the 2-year risk of first stroke by 92% (1.3% vs. 10.7%, P<0.001). Aspirin (A) and Plavix (B) have not been shown to meaningfully reduce primary stroke risk in sickle cell disease, and dual antiplatelet therapy (D) is not indicated for primary prevention in this population. Chronic transfusions lower the proportion of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) to below 30%, correcting anemia and decreasing vascular occlusion, while antiplatelet agents do not address the fundamental hemorheologic abnormalities in sickle cell disease.","conceptual_foundation":"Sickle cell disease is a hemoglobinopathy in which a point mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene leads to HbS polymerization, red cell sickling, chronic hemolysis, and vaso-occlusion. The most feared neurologic complication is ischemic stroke, particularly in children. Elevated transfusion velocities on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) are a validated surrogate marker of cerebrovascular stenosis and stroke risk (Adams et al., 1992). Chronic transfusion therapy aims to suppress endogenous HbS production, reduce hemolytic anemia, and improve blood rheology. It has become the standard of care for primary stroke prevention in high-risk pediatric sickle cell patients.","pathophysiology":"Under deoxygenated conditions, HbS polymerizes, distorting red blood cells into a sickle shape that adheres to endothelium, induces inflammation, and triggers vessel occlusion. Repeated episodes of vaso-occlusion lead to endothelial injury, smooth muscle proliferation, and progressive intracranial arterial stenosis, particularly of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Chronic transfusions replenish normal adult hemoglobin (HbA), dilute HbS, reduce hemolysis, and decrease blood viscosity, interrupting the vicious cycle of endothelial injury and occlusion that precipitates stroke.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with sickle cell disease frequently develop silent cerebral infarcts on MRI, detectable in up to 27% by age 6. Overt ischemic strokes occur in 7\u201310% of untreated high-risk patients. Presenting symptoms include acute hemiparesis, aphasia, visual field deficits, and seizures. Without intervention, recurrent infarction and progressive cognitive decline are common. Screening with annual TCD begins at age 2, identifying those with velocities >200 cm/s who derive the greatest benefit from transfusion therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Annual TCD is recommended by AHA/ASA (2014) for children aged 2\u201316 years with sickle cell disease to stratify stroke risk (Class I, Level A). Patients with velocities \u2265200 cm/s should be evaluated with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to confirm stenosis, and chronic transfusion initiated. Iron overload from transfusions necessitates periodic ferritin monitoring and consideration of chelation therapy, guided by serial MRI T2* or serum ferritin levels.","management_principles":"Chronic transfusion aims to maintain HbS <30% and total hemoglobin ~10 g/dL. The STOP 2 trial (2005) showed that discontinuation of transfusion leads to rebound stroke risk, supporting indefinite therapy. Iron chelation with deferasirox or deferoxamine is indicated when ferritin exceeds 1000 ng/mL or liver iron concentration rises. Hydroxyurea is being studied as a potential alternative but is not yet standard for primary stroke prevention.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up includes quarterly TCD to monitor velocities, monthly hemoglobin and reticulocyte counts, and biannual MRI/MRA for silent infarct surveillance. Iron studies every 3 months guide chelation. Long\u2010term monitoring for alloimmunization and transfusion reactions is essential. Counseling on compliance and central line management reduces complications.","clinical_pearls":"1. Regular transfusions reduce primary stroke risk by >90% in high\u2010risk pediatric sickle cell patients (STOP trial). 2. Target HbS <30% and total Hb ~10 g/dL to optimize rheology and minimize iron overload. 3. Annual TCD screening from age 2\u201316 identifies candidates for transfusion. 4. Iron chelation is mandatory to prevent hepatic and cardiac siderosis. 5. Discontinuation of transfusion leads to rapid rebound in stroke risk\u2014therapy is typically lifelong.","references":"1.

In cases of ischemic stroke, especially those presenting with borderzone infarcts, CTA can assess for significant carotid stenosis or occlusion, which are common causes of hemodynamic insufficiency leading to infarction in this territory. CTA allows for the quantification of stenosis severity and can also help identify other vascular pathologies such as tandem lesions (simultaneous stenosis at two locations) that could contribute to the ischemic event.","conceptual_foundation":"A deep borderzone infarction occurs in an area of the brain that lies between the territories of two major cerebral arteries, typically between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries (ACA and MCA). This region is particularly susceptible to ischemia due to its location at the farthest reaches of arterial supply, making it vulnerable to hemodynamic changes. \n\nThe term \"borderzone\" refers to areas that receive blood supply from two major arteries, and when there is compromised blood flow due to stenosis or occlusion in the supplying arteries, these areas are at risk for infarction. The deep borderzone is specifically associated with the watershed areas in the deeper structures of the brain, which are less perfused compared to the more centralized areas supplied directly by the main arteries.\n\n### 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiology of a left ICA deep borderzone infarction primarily involves hemodynamic insufficiency. When there is significant stenosis (>50%) or occlusion of the ICA, the blood flow to the corresponding brain regions decreases. This reduced perfusion can lead to ischemia and ultimately infarction in the brain tissue supplied by the affected artery.\n\nIn a normal scenario, collateral circulation may help maintain blood flow to these borderzone areas; however, if collateral pathways are inadequate or if there is a sudden drop in systemic blood pressure, the vulnerable borderzone regions may not receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients, leading to cell death and infarction. The ischemic cascade that follows involves excitotoxicity, inflammation, and apoptosis, further contributing to brain injury.\n\n### 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nPatients with a left ICA deep borderzone infarction may present with various neurological deficits. Common clinical manifestations can include:\n\n- Contralateral Weakness: Patients may exhibit weakness or hemiparesis on the right side of the body (due to the left hemisphere being affected).\n- Sensory Loss: There may be loss of sensation on the right side, correlating with the affected brain regions.\n- Cognitive Impairment: Depending on the extent of the infarction, patients might experience difficulties with executive functions, attention, and memory.\n- Visual Field Deficits: If the infarction impacts areas associated with vision, patients may exhibit visual field cuts (e.g., homonymous hemianopsia).\n\nSymptoms may develop suddenly, consistent with the acute nature of ischemic strokes, and can vary widely based on the specific brain areas involved and the extent of infarction.\n\n### 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe primary diagnostic tool used to evaluate suspected ischemic strokes includes neuroimaging.
