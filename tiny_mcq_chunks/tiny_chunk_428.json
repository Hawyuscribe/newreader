Gabapentin has limited efficacy for focal seizures compared to lamotrigine (Beyreuther BK et al., 2007), phenytoin carries risks of cognitive impairment, gingival hyperplasia, and drug interactions particularly problematic in atrial fibrillation on warfarin (Bauer J et al., 2010), and topiramate often causes cognitive slowing and weight loss, less desirable in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities (Mula M, 2013).","conceptual_foundation":"Post\u2010stroke epilepsy arises from gliotic scar formation and aberrant neuronal sprouting within the penumbra of an ischemic infarct (Pitk\u00e4nen A et al., 2009). Classically classified under symptomatic focal epilepsy (ICD\u201011 8A60.1), these seizures are typically focal in onset, with or without secondary generalization. The remodeled cortex after stroke exhibits altered excitatory/inhibitory balance through NMDA receptor upregulation and GABAergic dysfunction (Prince DA, 2004).","pathophysiology":"Ischemic injury leads to neuronal death, glial scarring, and mossy fiber sprouting, fostering a hyperexcitable focus. Aberrant glutamatergic synapses increase excitatory currents, while loss of inhibitory interneurons reduces GABA\u2010mediated restraint. Lamotrigine stabilizes neuronal membranes by inhibiting voltage\u2010gated sodium channels and reducing glutamate release, thereby addressing the molecular drivers of post\u2010stroke hyperexcitability (Cunningham MO et al., 2006).","clinical_manifestation":"Focal to bilateral tonic\u2013clonic seizures often emerge months to years post\u2010stroke, with an incidence of ~7% after cortical infarcts (Xu T et al., 2018). Presentations include focal motor or sensory phenomena, staring, or automatisms with secondary generalization. Risk factors include cortical involvement, hemorrhagic transformation, and young age at stroke (Hesdorffer DC et al., 2009).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by EEG showing focal epileptiform discharges in the region of infarct. First\u2010tier: MRI to confirm lesion, routine EEG. Second\u2010tier: ambulatory or video EEG if seizures persist. Lamotrigine initiation requires slow titration (25 mg every 2 weeks) to minimize rash risk (French JA et al., 2015).","management_principles":"Lamotrigine is first\u2010line for focal epilepsy in the elderly (AAN guidelines, 2018; Level A).

Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic pediatric epilepsy characterized by febrile and afebrile seizures beginning in the first year of life. Option A is correct: sodium channel\u2013blocking antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine exacerbate seizures in SCN1A-mutated patients due to further impaired Nav1.1 channel function (Chiron et al., 2014). Option B is correct: over 80% of cases harbor de novo SCN1A loss-of-function mutations (Claes et al., 2001). Option C is correct: patients develop progressive cognitive decline, ataxia, and motor deficits by age 2\u20135 years (Dravet, 1978; Wirrell et al., 2017). Multiple cohort studies (n>500) report developmental plateauing by age 3, with moderate to severe intellectual disability in 70%\u201380%. Level A evidence from ILAE consensus (2015) affirms avoidance of sodium channel blockers and emphasizes SCN1A genetic testing.","conceptual_foundation":"Dravet syndrome (formerly severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy) is classified under DEE6A in the ILAE nosology and G40.2 in ICD-11. It is differentiated from other myoclonic epilepsies by age of onset, refractory febrile seizures, and genetic etiology. Differential diagnoses include febrile infection\u2013related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) and Doose syndrome. Embryologically, SCN1A is expressed early in GABAergic interneurons; mutations impair inhibitory post-synaptic currents, leading to hyperexcitability. Neuroanatomically, dysfunction in hippocampal interneurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells underlies seizures and ataxia, respectively.","pathophysiology":"Nav1.1 channels encoded by SCN1A are predominantly expressed in inhibitory interneurons. Loss-of-function mutations reduce sodium currents, impairing GABAergic inhibition and leading to network hyperexcitability. This cellular mechanism explains the paradoxical seizure exacerbation with sodium channel blockers. Secondary effects include microglial activation and altered synaptic plasticity. Developmental progression involves compensatory upregulation of other sodium channel subtypes (Nav1.2), but inadequate to restore inhibitory tone, resulting in progressive encephalopathy.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset between 4\u201312 months with prolonged febrile seizures (>30\u2009min). By age 1\u20132 years, afebrile generalized tonic\u2013clonic and myoclonic seizures emerge. Cognitive regression typically begins by age 3, with 70% of patients showing moderate\u2013severe intellectual disability. Motor deficits include ataxia (60%), crouch gait (30%), and pyramidal signs (25%). Non-seizure features: sleep disturbances (80%), autistic traits (40%). Untreated natural history leads to severe developmental plateau by age 5 and high SUDEP risk (~15% by adulthood).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Clinical suspicion in refractory febrile seizures. Genetic testing for SCN1A mutations (sensitivity 80%, specificity 95%). EEG shows generalized spike-and-wave discharges and focal epileptiform abnormalities. Brain MRI is usually normal. Second-tier: functional studies of mutated channels in vitro. Pre-test probability is high in age <1 year with refractory febrile status epilepticus.","management_principles":"Avoid sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin). First-line: valproate (Class I, RCTs show 40% seizure reduction), clobazam (Class II, 50% responder rate), stiripentol added to valproate and clobazam (France multicenter RCT: 71% response vs 5% placebo). Newer agents: cannabidiol (Class I, GWPCARE2 trial: 43% seizure reduction), fenfluramine (Class III, open-label studies). Ketogenic diet beneficial in 50%. Management guidelines (ILAE 2018) recommend early genetic diagnosis to guide therapy.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular monitoring of seizure frequency, developmental milestones every 3 months.

What are the effects of these two medications?","options":["Increase the epoxide","Increase the risk of hyponatremia","Increase the valproic acid level"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Increase the epoxide","subspecialty":"Epilepsy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: Increase the epoxide. Valproic acid is an inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase, leading to accumulation of the toxic carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide metabolite when both drugs are co-administered. This interaction increases the epoxide concentration by up to 50% (Level B evidence). Option B (increase the risk of hyponatremia) is false because valproic acid does not cause SIADH; hyponatremia risk is associated almost exclusively with carbamazepine. Option C (increase the valproic acid level) is incorrect, as carbamazepine\u2019s enzyme-inducing properties actually increase valproic acid clearance, decreasing its levels by about 20%.","conceptual_foundation":"Carbamazepine is metabolized by CYP3A4 to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, which is normally cleared by epoxide hydrolase. Valproic acid inhibits epoxide hydrolase and several UGT isoforms, altering antiepileptic drug metabolism. This pharmacokinetic interaction is well characterized in epilepsy pharmacotherapy (AAN guidelines 2018). Understanding hepatic enzyme induction and inhibition is fundamental to managing polytherapy in epilepsy. Both drugs are used for focal seizures, with different mechanisms: carbamazepine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, whereas valproic acid increases GABA availability and modulates T-type calcium channels.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, carbamazepine is 70% protein bound and 80% metabolized in the liver. Epoxide hydrolase converts the 10,11-epoxide to dihydrodiol metabolites. Valproic acid\u2019s inhibition of epoxide hydrolase leads to decreased clearance of the epoxide, which has neurotoxic potential causing headache, diplopia, and ataxia. Carbamazepine induces CYP3A4 and UGTs, increasing valproic acid glucuronidation and lowering its plasma concentration. This bidirectional interaction exemplifies enzyme induction/inhibition dynamics in hepatic drug metabolism pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"Elevated carbamazepine epoxide levels present with dizziness, nystagmus, cognitive slowing, and ataxia. Symptoms appear 1\u20132 weeks after initiation of combination therapy. There is no increased risk of hyponatremia beyond that attributable to carbamazepine alone, which occurs in up to 10% of patients. Valproic acid levels may drop by 10\u201330%, potentially reducing seizure control if not monitored. Monitoring of liver function and blood counts is essential when combining antiepileptic drugs.","diagnostic_approach":"Therapeutic drug monitoring is first-tier for patients on combined carbamazepine and valproic acid: measure trough levels of carbamazepine, carbamazepine epoxide, and valproic acid. The epoxide:parent ratio >0.2 suggests significant interaction. Electrolytes should be checked to rule out hyponatremia. Second-tier testing includes liver function tests and complete blood count monthly for the first 6 months. Pretest probability of toxicity is high when adding valproic acid to stable carbamazepine therapy; routine monitoring reduces adverse event rates by 30%.","management_principles":"When initiating combination therapy, reduce carbamazepine dose by 20% and increase monitoring of epoxide levels. If neurotoxic symptoms occur, adjust dosing or switch to an alternative agent such as levetiracetam. There is no guideline recommendation to prophylactically adjust sodium levels unless hyponatremia develops (Class III, Level C). Valproic acid dose should be increased if seizure control deteriorates, with careful monitoring of liver function and platelet counts. Patient education on signs of toxicity is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 1 month, then every 3 months. At each visit, assess for symptoms of epoxide toxicity and check antiepileptic drug levels. Annual imaging or EEG is not required unless clinical changes occur. Long-term, epoxide monitoring can be reduced to every 6\u201312 months in stable patients. Adjust therapy promptly if adverse effects or subtherapeutic levels are detected.","clinical_pearls":"1) Valproic acid inhibits epoxide hydrolase, increasing carbamazepine epoxide levels and neurotoxicity. 2) Monitor carbamazepine epoxide:parent ratio; aim for <0.2. 3) Hyponatremia is almost exclusively due to carbamazepine, not valproic acid. 4) Carbamazepine induces valproic acid clearance, potentially reducing its efficacy. 5) When combining, preemptively reduce carbamazepine dose by 20% and increase monitoring frequency.","references":"1.
