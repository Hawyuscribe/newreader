In microvascular decompression series, the SCA is implicated in up to 80% of cases (Jannetta, Neurosurgery 1996). PCA (B) and Pcom (C) rarely course adjacent to CN V root entry and are not typical offenders.","conceptual_foundation":"Trigeminal neuralgia is classified under ICD-11 (8A80.2) as a neuropathic facial pain disorder. It arises from pulsatile arterial compression (neurovascular conflict) at the root entry zone in the pons. The trigeminal nerve has three divisions (V1 ophthalmic, V2 maxillary, V3 mandibular) and enters the pons at the midlateral pontine level. Vascular loops most often from the SCA compress this entry zone.","pathophysiology":"Chronic pulsatile compression by an arterial loop causes focal demyelination of trigeminal afferent fibers at the root entry zone. This demyelination leads to ectopic generation and ephaptic transmission of impulses, resulting in paroxysmal lancinating pain in the V2 distribution. Extension of compression can cause involvement of adjacent V3 fibers, leading to decreased sensation.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients experience brief (<2 minutes) electric shock\u2013like episodes triggered by light touch or facial movements in V2 and sometimes V3. Between attacks, exam may be normal; sensory loss suggests more extensive compression. Incidence peaks in the sixth decade, slight female predominance.","diagnostic_approach":"High\u2010resolution MRI with T2\u2010weighted 3D sequences (FIESTA/CISS) has a sensitivity of ~90% for identifying neurovascular conflict. Neurophysiological testing (blink reflex) can support diagnosis but is not first\u2010line. Routine CT angiography is not sensitive for small vessel loops.","management_principles":"Initial therapy is carbamazepine (200 mg BID, titrated to 600\u20131200 mg/day) with ~70% response rate. Oxcarbazepine is an alternative. For refractory cases or intolerable side effects, microvascular decompression surgery (Class IIA evidence) targeting the SCA loop is recommended; pain relief is achieved in ~90% of patients.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical response and blood levels of carbamazepine every 3\u20136 months.

It exerts analgesic effects by inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake without direct vasoconstriction. While it can prolong QTc and requires ECG monitoring in heart disease, it is not absolutely contraindicated following MI, making it an acceptable consideration in CAD with proper cardiac follow\u2010up. Common misconception: confusing anticholinergic side effects with vascular contraindications.\n\nOption B \u2013 Verapamil (approx. 60 words): Verapamil, a non\u2010dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is a well-established second\u2010line agent for migraine prevention per AAN 2022 Practice Parameter. It reduces cortical spreading depression and modulates vascular tone without provoking coronary vasospasm. In fact, it may improve coronary perfusion in stable CAD.

Misconception: treating verapamil\u2019s hypotensive effects as ischemic contraindications.\n\nOption C \u2013 Triptan (approx. 75 words): Triptans (sumatriptan, rizatriptan) are potent 5\u2010HT1B/1D agonists causing intracranial and extracranial vasoconstriction. They are absolutely contraindicated in patients with known CAD or recent MI due to risk of coronary vasospasm and infarction (per International Headache Society 2018).

This is a common error among trainees.","conceptual_foundation":"The conceptual foundation of migraine prevention in cardiovascular disease integrates cerebral vascular anatomy and neurogenic pathways. Key structures include the trigeminovascular system: trigeminal nerve afferents synapse in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, projecting to the thalamus and cortex (per AHS 2018). The posterior circulation (vertebrobasilar) and anterior circulation (carotid branches) both contribute to meningeal vessel innervation. Embryologically, these vessels arise from pharyngeal arch arteries and neural crest cells, explaining developmental vascular anomalies that may influence headache syndromes.\n\nNormal physiology entails pulsatile cerebral blood flow regulated by autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, and endothelial nitric oxide release. Related conditions include hemiplegic migraine (CACNA1A mutation), familial migraine syndromes, and vestibular migraine. Early 20th\u2010century hypotheses emphasized vascular dilation, evolving to modern neurogenic inflammation concepts with CGRP and PACAP involvement. Key landmarks: superior sagittal sinus, cavernous sinus, and circle of Willis. Clinically, identifying vessel segments near pain receptors guides invasive procedures and neuromodulation. Historically, therapeutic focus shifted from ergotamine to selective serotonin agonists and now to monoclonal antibodies against CGRP.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, migraine pathophysiology involves activation of trigeminal afferents releasing CGRP, substance P, and neurokinin A, triggering vasodilation and plasma protein extravasation in dura mater vessels. 5\u2010HT1B/1D receptors on presynaptic terminals modulate neurotransmitter release; triptans agonize these receptors causing potent vasoconstriction (per IHS 2018). Ion channel mutations (CACNA1A, SCN1A) alter neuronal excitability, leading to cortical spreading depression. Genetic studies show familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 linked to CACNA1A with autosomal dominant inheritance (penetrance ~70%).\n\nInflammatory mediators such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and interleukins amplify nociceptive signaling. Mitochondrial dysfunction (OXPHOS deficits) reduces ATP availability, impairing neuronal repolarization. The time course begins with prodrome (hours), then aura (10\u201360 minutes), headache phase (4\u201372 hours), and postdrome. Compensatory upregulation of endogenous endocannabinoids and endorphins often attenuates pain but can fail in chronic cases. Repeated attacks may induce central sensitization, lowering threshold for future episodes.","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine typically presents with a gradual onset of unilateral throbbing headache over 5\u201360 minutes, peaking at 1\u20132 hours, lasting up to 72 hours if untreated. Associated symptoms include photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. A detailed neurological exam is often normal between attacks but may reveal transient hemiparesis in familial hemiplegic migraine.\n\nIn pediatric patients, attacks are shorter (<2 hours) and bilateral; elderly may experience vestibular symptoms more often. Women have a twofold higher prevalence due to hormonal influences. Systemic signs like mild fever and leukocytosis are rare. Severity scales: Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS) grades disability from minimal to severe; HIT\u20106 scores \u226560 indicate severe impact. Red flags include sudden onset (\u201cthunderclap\u201d), progressive worsening, focal deficits, or raised intracranial pressure signs. Without treatment, frequency may increase and chronic migraine (\u226515 days/month) can develop, causing significant quality\u2010of\u2010life impairment.","diagnostic_approach":"1.

Conjunctival injection (option B) is very common but slightly less frequent than lacrimation.","conceptual_foundation":"Cluster headache is classified under the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) code 3.1.1. It is a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia characterized by severe unilateral orbital or temporal pain with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. Pathophysiologically, activation of the trigeminal\u2013autonomic reflex via the posterior hypothalamus leads to parasympathetic outflow through the superior salivatory nucleus and sphenopalatine ganglion, resulting in lacrimation, conjunctival injection, and nasal congestion. Differential includes paroxysmal hemicrania (responds to indomethacin), SUNCT/SUNA, hemicrania continua, and migraine variants.","pathophysiology":"In healthy individuals, the trigeminal nerve conveys nociceptive signals from the dura and intracranial vessels. In cluster headache, hypothalamic activation (evidenced by functional imaging) triggers the trigeminal autonomic reflex. Parasympathetic efferents induce lacrimation via lacrimal gland stimulation and conjunctival vasodilation. The short duration and high frequency of attacks reflect cyclic hypothalamic releasing activity and circadian influence (linked to melatonin secretion).

Medication-overuse headache can develop with regular use of simple analgesics (>15 days/month) or combination analgesics (>10 days/month).","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical per ICHD-3 criteria. No imaging is required in typical presentations. Red flags (SNOOP4): Systemic symptoms, Neurologic signs, Onset sudden, Onset after 50 years, Pattern change, Papilledema, Positional headache, Precipitated by Valsalva, Postural, Pregnancy. Normal neurologic examination and head CT/MRI if atypical features are present.","management_principles":"First-line acute treatment for moderate to severe migraine includes triptans (e.g., sumatriptan 100 mg PO; may repeat once after 2 hours). Metoclopramide 10 mg IV/PO can be added for nausea. NSAIDs or aspirin are recommended for mild to moderate attacks. Opioids and barbiturate combinations are discouraged due to risk of overuse headache and dependence (AHS guidelines, Headache. 2015;55(1):1\u201318).","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow up every 3\u20136 months to assess efficacy, side effects, and headache frequency. Consider preventive therapy if monthly headache days \u22654 or significant disability. Monitor for medication-overuse headache; counsel to limit acute medications to \u22642 days/week. Keep headache diary to track triggers and response.","clinical_pearls":"1. Triptans are first-line for moderate to severe migraine; avoid if cardiovascular risk. 2. Limit use of simple analgesics to \u22642 days/week to prevent medication-overuse headache. 3. Add antiemetic (metoclopramide) if nausea impairs oral drug absorption. 4. Screen for red flags and neuroimaging if atypical features. 5. Consider preventive therapy when acute treatment fails or attacks occur \u22654 days/month.","references":"1. Lipton RB, et al.
