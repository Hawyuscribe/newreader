Observation alone (A) allows ongoing demyelination and accrual of disability. Delaying imaging (C) may miss subclinical activity; MRI follow-up at 6\u201312 months is performed after DMT initiation rather than before treatment. Major guidelines (AAN 2018, ECTRIMS/EAN 2018) strongly recommend early DMT to reduce relapse rate by ~30\u201350% (Level A evidence) and slow disability progression (hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.54\u20130.86).","conceptual_foundation":"MS is a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS with relapsing-remitting or progressive courses. Diagnostic criteria (2017 McDonald) require dissemination in time and space, supported by MRI lesions in white matter and oligoclonal bands in CSF. Early DMT targets adaptive immunity (e.g., interferons, glatiramer) or B cells (e.g., ocrelizumab) to reduce inflammatory activity. Classification per ICD-11: 8A40.0\u20138A40.Z; DSM-5-TR includes autoimmune encephalitis under neurological disorders. DMT evolution: from injectables (1990s) to oral agents (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) and monoclonals (natalizumab, alemtuzumab).","pathophysiology":"In MS, autoreactive T cells cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, activate microglia, and initiate demyelination via cytokine release (IL-17, IFN-\u03b3) and complement activation. B cells contribute via antigen presentation and antibody production. Acute relapse is mediated by perivenular inflammation; chronic lesion evolution involves gliosis and axonal loss. DMT mechanisms: interferon-\u03b2 reduces antigen presentation and T-cell proliferation; glatiramer modulates T-cell phenotypes; sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators sequester lymphocytes; anti-CD20 depletes B cells.","clinical_manifestation":"Relapses present with new neurological deficits lasting \u226524 hours (optic neuritis, sensory loss, ataxia). Inter-relapse periods may have subclinical MRI activity. Without DMT, annualized relapse rate (ARR) is ~0.8; early treatment reduces ARR to ~0.3. Disability accumulation (EDSS increase) occurs more rapidly in untreated patients. MRI lesions develop months before clinical symptoms.","diagnostic_approach":"Confirm diagnosis using 2017 McDonald criteria: MRI of brain and spine with gadolinium, CSF oligoclonal bands. Exclude mimics (NMO, small-vessel disease, sarcoidosis). Baseline JC virus antibody status prior to natalizumab. Pre-treatment labs: CBC, LFTs, hepatitis panel, varicella immunity. Monitoring MRI at 6\u201312 months post-DMT initiation to assess disease activity.","management_principles":"Initiate first-line DMT (interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate) promptly. Choose based on efficacy, safety, JCV status, patient preference. Class I evidence supports early DMT to reduce relapse and slow disability. Dose: interferon-\u03b21a 44 \u03bcg SC three times/week; glatiramer 20 mg SC daily. Monitor tolerability, flu-like symptoms, injection-site reactions. Escalate to higher-efficacy agents (natalizumab, ocrelizumab) for suboptimal response or aggressive disease.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinic visits every 3\u20136 months to assess relapses, EDSS. Annual brain MRI to monitor lesions (T2 burden, gadolinium enhancement). Monitor labs: CBC, LFTs every 3 months.

Aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4-IgG) is a highly specific autoantibody directed against the water channel protein aquaporin-4 on astrocyte endfeet. Multiple large cohorts have demonstrated that cell-based assays for AQP4-IgG yield a sensitivity of approximately 75\u201390% and a specificity exceeding 99% for NMOSD (Wingerchuk et al. 2015; Jarius et al. 2020). The 2015 International Panel diagnostic criteria for NMOSD designate AQP4-IgG seropositivity as a central criterion, mandating at least one core clinical characteristic for diagnosis. In contrast, AQP4-IgG is absent in other demyelinating or neurodegenerative conditions including multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS).\n\nOption A (MS) is incorrect: MS is not associated with AQP4-IgG, and oligoclonal bands are positive in >95% of MS but only 20\u201330% of AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD cases. Option C (ALS) is incorrect: ALS has no humoral autoantibody marker and is a motor neuron disease without astrocytopathy mediated by AQP4-IgG. Option D (GBS) is incorrect: GBS is a peripheral nerve immune-mediated neuropathy, often associated with anti-GM1 or anti-GQ1b antibodies, not AQP4-IgG. Common misconceptions include equating any demyelinating disease with AQP4-IgG positivity; however, AQP4-IgG specifically indicates astrocyte targeting in NMOSD (Jarius et al. 2010).","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is an inflammatory astrocytopathy of the central nervous system, distinct from multiple sclerosis. Under ICD-11, NMOSD is classified among 'Inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS' (8A40.0). In DSM-5-TR, NMOSD is not psychiatric but may present with neuropsychiatric symptoms secondary to brain involvement. Historically, Devic\u2019s disease was regarded as a variant of MS until Lennon et al. (2004) identified AQP4-IgG as the first specific biomarker. Aquaporin-4 is a tetrameric water channel highly expressed in astrocyte foot processes at the blood-brain barrier, regulating water homeostasis. Astrocyte injury leads to secondary demyelination and neuronal loss. Differential diagnoses include MOG-IgG-associated disorder (preserved astrocytes, primary demyelination), idiopathic transverse myelitis, CNS lupus, sarcoidosis, and paraneoplastic syndromes. The nosological evolution reflects a shift from purely clinical to immunopathologically defined categories, emphasizing the centrality of AQP4-IgG in distinguishing NMOSD from other demyelinating disorders (Bennett et al. 2015). Embryologically, astrocytes derive from neuroectoderm; AQP4 expression appears during late gestation, coinciding with blood\u2013brain barrier maturation. Neuroanatomically, affected regions include the optic nerves, spinal cord (longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis \u22653 segments), area postrema, diencephalon, brainstem, and cerebrum. Astrocyte loss disrupts glutamate clearance (EAAT2) and blood\u2013brain barrier integrity, leading to complement activation and immune cell infiltration. Genetic associations include HLA-DQ alleles and polymorphisms in IL-17 and IL-2 pathways, reflecting a predisposition to humoral autoimmunity.","pathophysiology":"In health, aquaporin-4 channels facilitate bidirectional water movement at astrocyte endfeet, maintaining CNS fluid homeostasis and supporting the blood\u2013brain barrier. In NMOSD, circulating AQP4-IgG\u2014predominantly IgG1 subclass\u2014binds the M23 isoform of AQP4 on astrocyte processes, triggering complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Complement activation (C1q binding, membrane attack complex formation) induces astrocyte necrosis, releasing damage\u2010associated molecular patterns that recruit granulocytes and macrophages. Secondary mechanisms include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity via Fc\u03b3 receptors on natural killer cells and macrophages. The resulting astrocytopathy disrupts glutamate uptake (via EAAT2), causing excitotoxic neuronal injury and demyelination. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is upregulated, promoting plasmablast survival and blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Genetic factors modulate B-cell tolerance and complement regulation. Chronic astrocyte loss leads to cavitation and gliosis, manifesting as longitudinal spinal lesions and optic nerve atrophy. In contrast, MS is T-cell\u2013driven with oligodendrocyte targeting, and GBS involves peripheral nerve antigens (GM1, GQ1b). Temporal progression: acute complement-mediated astrocyte lysis occurs within days, subacute inflammatory infiltration peaks at 1\u20132 weeks, and chronic gliosis within months. The distinct immunopathology underpins targeted therapies (complement inhibitors, IL-6 receptor antagonists, B-cell depleters).","clinical_manifestation":"NMOSD typically presents in adults (median age ~40 years) with a strong female predominance (F:M \u2248 9:1). Cardinal syndromes include: 1) Optic neuritis\u2014often bilateral, severe visual loss (median nadir visual acuity 20/200), poor recovery in two-thirds of cases; 2) Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM)\u2014\u22653 vertebral segments, causing severe motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction; 3) Area postrema syndrome\u2014refractory hiccups, nausea, vomiting; 4) Brainstem syndromes\u2014diplopia, dysphagia; 5) Diencephalic and cerebral presentations. Prodromal symptoms may include headache or febrile illness. Relapsing course in >80% if untreated, with accrual of disability between relapses. Untreated, 50% require a cane within 5 years; 20% become bedridden or blind by 5 years. Variants: pediatric NMOSD presents with more brain involvement; elderly onset often mimics stroke. Pregnancy may alter relapse risk\u2014higher in postpartum. Immunocompromised patients may have atypical infections mimicking relapse. The 2015 diagnostic criteria require at least one core clinical characteristic plus AQP4-IgG seropositivity, or two core characteristics (one optic neuritis or LETM) plus negative AQP4-IgG with supportive MRI, excluding alternative diagnoses. Sensitivity of criteria is 76%, specificity 97% (Wingerchuk et al. 2015).","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic approach begins with clinical suspicion of NMOSD in patients with optic neuritis or LETM. First-tier testing includes serum AQP4-IgG by cell-based assay (CBA)\u2014the gold standard; sensitivity 75\u201390%, specificity >99% (Jarius et al. 2020). MRI of brain and spinal cord identifies LETM (\u22653 segments, central cord T2 hyperintensity), optic nerve enhancement extending >50% of length, and periependymal brain lesions, differentiating from MS. CSF analysis shows pleocytosis (median WBC 50 cells/\u00b5L, neutrophil predominance), elevated protein, and oligoclonal bands in only ~20\u201330%. If AQP4-IgG is negative but suspicion remains high, test for MOG-IgG by CBA (sensitivity ~40%, specificity ~95%). Exclude mimics: infectious (HSV, VZV, TB), neoplastic, sarcoidosis (ACE levels, chest imaging), metabolic, and vascular causes. Pre-test probability is high in female patients with bilateral optic neuritis or LETM. The number needed to test (NNT) for AQP4-IgG in suspected cases is ~1.2. Second-tier investigations include spinal angiography if vascular myelopathy suspected. Third-tier specialized testing includes evaluation of complement levels (C3, C4), cytokine profiling (elevated IL-6), and exploratory PET imaging. In resource-limited settings, reliance on clinical core features and MRI pattern recognition may suffice for presumptive diagnosis.","management_principles":"Acute relapse management: High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 5 days (Class I, Level A evidence); if inadequate improvement by day 7, initiate plasma exchange (PE)\u20145\u20137 exchanges over 10\u201314 days, yielding full or partial recovery in ~50\u201360% (Crane et al. 2019). Long-term relapse prevention: three FDA-approved therapies targeting distinct immune pathways: Eculizumab (anti-C5 complement inhibitor) reduces relapse risk by 94% (HR 0.06; PREVENT trial, Cree et al. 2019), Satralizumab (anti-IL-6R) reduces relapse risk by ~79% (HR 0.21; SAkuraSky trial; Yamamura et al. 2019), and Inebilizumab (anti-CD19 B-cell depleter) reduces relapse risk by 72.8% (HR 0.272; N-MOmentum trial; Pittock et al. 2020). Off-label immunosuppressants include azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil (2 g/day), achieving ~50% relapse reduction. Rituximab (375 mg/m\u00b2 weekly \u00d74 or 1 g biweekly) depletes CD20+ B cells: relapse hazard ratio 0.17 vs. baseline (Kim et al. 2018). Monitor for infections, cytopenias, liver toxicity, and PNH risk with eculizumab; administer meningococcal vaccination prior to complement inhibition. Non-pharmacological: vision rehabilitation, spinal cord physical therapy, bladder training, and psychosocial support. Pregnancy: switch to lower teratogenic risk agents (azathioprine), avoid mycophenolate and teriflunomide. Pediatric dosing adjusted by weight and limited trial data.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be followed every 3 months during the first year after diagnosis, then every 6 months if stable (AAN guideline 2021). Clinical assessment includes Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), visual acuity, and quality-of-life questionnaires. MRI of brain and spinal cord annually or with new symptoms to detect subclinical activity; standardized lesion quantification algorithms can guide therapy adjustments. Laboratory monitoring: CBC, LFTs every 3 months for immunosuppressants; complement levels if on eculizumab (C5 functional assay); serum AQP4-IgG titers may correlate with disease activity but are not sole treatment guides. Vaccination review annually, ensure up-to-date pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. Physical and occupational therapy evaluations biannually to optimize function. Rehabilitation: tailored gait training, spasticity management (baclofen, tizanidine), and low\u2010vision aids. Transition of care: coordinate between neurology, ophthalmology, rehabilitation, and primary care. Prognostic factors: early relapse frequency, severe initial attack (bilateral optic neuritis, high\u2010lesion load), AQP4-IgG titer, and time to initiation of immunotherapy.

No other options are provided to consider. In stiff-person syndrome, anti-GAD65 antibodies are detected in approximately 60\u201380% of cases, EMG reveals continuous motor-unit activity at rest, and lumbar lordosis is a hallmark clinical clue. Standard diagnostic criteria (Dalakas et al. 2020) emphasize these features, with sensitivity of clinical plus serological criteria >90% and specificity >95%.","conceptual_foundation":"Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by dysfunction of inhibitory GABAergic pathways. Classified under ICD-11 8A61.2 (\u201cStiff-person syndrome\u201d) and DSM-5-TR under \u2018Neurological disorders complicating medical conditions\u2019, SPS sits at the intersection of neuroimmunology and movement disorders. Historically first described by Moersch and Woltman in 1956, it has evolved from a rare neuromuscular curiosity to a well-recognized autoimmune synaptopathy. Embryologically, the disorder involves interneurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord derived from the p0 progenitor domain. Key neuroanatomical substrates include GABAergic Renshaw cells and spinal inhibitory interneurons with projections modulating alpha-motor neurons. The GAD65 enzyme, central to GABA synthesis, is the primary autoantigen, linking molecular immunology to clinical neurology.","pathophysiology":"Normal inhibitory tone in the spinal cord relies on GABA synthesized by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65). In SPS, pathogenic autoantibodies target GAD65, leading to reduced GABA release and disinhibition of alpha-motor neurons. This manifests as continuous motor-unit firing, muscle rigidity, and spasms. At the cellular level, diminished GABAergic synaptic currents have been demonstrated in animal models (Radziewicz et al. 2019), and blockade of GAD65 reproduces the rigidity phenotype. Compensatory upregulation of spinal glycine receptors is insufficient to restore inhibition, leading to chronic stiffness. Spasms reflect paroxysmal hyperexcitability fueled by sensory triggers that activate spinal reflex arcs in the absence of normal inhibitory control.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present in the fourth to sixth decade with insidious onset of axial stiffness, lumbar hyperlordosis, and episodic painful spasms triggered by startle, emotional stress, or tactile stimuli. Frequency of spasms varies: mild cases <1/week, severe cases >10/week. Progressive rigidity may encase the trunk and proximal limbs, leading to postural deformities. Subtypes include classic SPS versus focal variants (e.g., stiff-leg syndrome). Anti-GAD positive patients often have coexisting autoimmune endocrinopathies (type 1 diabetes in ~30%). Without treatment, gait becomes restricted, and falls from spasms are common. Formal diagnostic criteria (Dalakas 2020) require clinical rigidity, EMG confirmation, and absence of alternative causes, with sensitivity 92% and specificity 96%.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes clinical assessment of rigidity and lordosis, serology for anti-GAD65 (sensitivity 65\u201380%, specificity 90\u201395%) and anti-amphiphysin when paraneoplastic suspicion arises. EMG is essential: continuous motor-unit activity at rest suppressed by diazepam (sensitivity 85%, specificity 98%). MRI of the spine is indicated to exclude structural causes of rigidity. Second-tier tests include CSF analysis (mildly elevated protein in 50%) and paraneoplastic panels. In resource-limited settings, a positive therapeutic trial of diazepam with EMG back-up can guide diagnosis. Novel assays for GAD65 epitope specificity improve diagnostic yield but remain research tools.","management_principles":"First-line symptomatic therapy uses high-dose benzodiazepines (diazepam 5\u201320 mg TID, NNT 4 for spasm reduction) and baclofen (10\u201380 mg/day). Adverse effects (drowsiness, confusion) require slow titration. Immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days monthly) has Class I evidence (Dalakas 2001; NNT 3 for clinical improvement). Second-line includes plasmapheresis and rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74), with benefit in refractory cases (Level B). Autonomic monitoring is needed due to hypotension risk. Physical therapy focuses on gentle stretching; orthoses may aid posture. Emerging therapies target the neonatal Fc receptor (efgartigimod) in early trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up visits every 3\u20136 months assess rigidity scores (e.g., Modified SPS Rating Scale), spasm diaries, and functional status (10-m walk test). Monitor for benzodiazepine and baclofen side effects with liver function tests and cognitive screening. Imaging follow-up is not routinely indicated unless new neurological signs emerge. Immunotherapy responders should be reassessed for tapering schedules; IVIG intervals may be extended to 6\u20138 weeks. Long-term prognosis is variable; early immunotherapy predicts better functional outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Lumbar hyperlordosis in an adult with axial stiffness is pathognomonic for SPS. 2. Anti-GAD65 antibodies confirm diagnosis but negative serology does not exclude SPS. 3. EMG showing continuous motor-unit activity suppressed by benzodiazepines is diagnostic. 4. IVIG has the strongest evidence for modifying disease course (Class I). 5. SPS often coexists with other autoimmune diseases (e.g., type 1 diabetes).","references":"1. Dalakas MC.

Multiple Sclerosis is the most common non-compressive cause of myelopathy in young adults in temperate zones. Epidemiological studies across North America and Europe report an annual incidence of MS between 2.2 and 10.0 per 100,000 and a prevalence of 50 to 300 per 100,000 (Filippi et al. 2018). In temperate regions, MS accounts for roughly 40\u201360% of cases of non-traumatic spinal cord dysfunction in individuals aged 18\u201345 (Korsvik et al. 2019). The AAN Practice Guideline on MS diagnosis (2017) states that MS is the most frequent inflammatory myelopathy in this demographic (Level A evidence).\n\nIncorrect Options:\nB. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a compressive degenerative condition affecting older adults (mean age > 55 years) and is uncommon in young adults (Rhee et al. 2020). Its prevalence increases with age and radiographic spondylosis, not typical in the under-45 population.\nC. Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) has a lower incidence (0.5\u20131.5 per 100,000) and prevalence (~4\u201310 per 100,000) than MS in temperate regions, and while it also causes longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, it represents <10% of demyelinating myelopathies (Pittock et al. 2019).\nD. Sarcoidosis-associated myelopathy is rare, with neurosarcoidosis affecting 5\u201310% of sarcoidosis patients and spinal involvement in only 1\u20132% (Cohen Aubart et al. 2019). This accounts for a very small fraction of young adult myelopathies in temperate climates.","conceptual_foundation":"Myelopathy refers to pathology of the spinal cord leading to motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction below the lesion level. Etiologically, myelopathies are classified as compressive (e.g., spondylosis, neoplasms) or non-compressive (e.g., inflammatory, infectious, vascular, metabolic). Within the ICD-11 classification, MS falls under demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, code 8A60.00. Historically, MS was first described by Charcot in the 19th century as a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder. Its nosological evolution saw the addition of relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive subtypes in the 1996 McDonald criteria, refined in 2017 to include radiologically isolated syndrome.\n\nDifferential considerations for young adult myelopathy include viral myelitis (enterovirus, HSV), post-infectious acute transverse myelitis, metabolic causes (B12 deficiency), vascular etiologies (spinal dural arteriovenous fistula), and genetic leukodystrophies presenting in adolescence. Embryologically, the spinal cord arises from the caudal neural tube; disruptions in oligodendrocyte development can predispose to demyelinating processes. Neuroanatomically, MS lesions localize to perivenular regions in the white matter of the cervical cord, often spanning less than two vertebral segments, contrasting with the longitudinally extensive lesions (> three segments) of NMOSD. The blood-brain barrier disruption in MS is mediated by autoreactive T cells and macrophage infiltration, whereas compressive myelopathy shows ischemic change due to mechanical narrowing.","pathophysiology":"Normal spinal cord physiology relies on saltatory conduction via myelinated axons. In MS, autoreactive CD4+ Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes cross a disrupted blood\u2013brain barrier, releasing cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17, which activate microglia and macrophages to phagocytose myelin (Gold et al. 2020). B cells contribute by producing oligoclonal IgG bands in cerebrospinal fluid, marking intrathecal humoral immunity. Demyelination causes slowed conduction velocity, conduction block, and axonal loss over time, leading to permanent deficits.\n\nIn contrast, cervical spondylotic myelopathy causes mechanical compression, ischemia of anterior spinal artery branches, and secondary demyelination by oligodendrocyte apoptosis. NMOSD is mediated by anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies causing complement-dependent astrocyte injury and secondary demyelination. Sarcoidosis features granulomatous inflammation with noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas leading to focal cord compression or vasculitis. The acute onset and longitudinal lesion length differ fundamentally from the multifocal small lesions in MS. Temporal progression in MS is relapsing-remitting initially, with variable recovery and residual deficits, whereas compressive myelopathy is insidiously progressive. Secondary neurodegeneration in MS correlates with sustained microglial activation and mitochondrial injury (Mahad et al. 2015).","clinical_manifestation":"Multiple Sclerosis myelopathy typically presents in adults aged 20\u201340 with subacute onset of sensory disturbances (numbness, paresthesias), motor weakness (usually spastic), gait ataxia, and Lhermitte sign in up to 40% of cases. Pain is reported in ~20%. Autonomic dysfunction (bladder, bowel) occurs in 30\u201350%. Lesions are often cervical, causing upper limb sensory symptoms and lower limb spastic paresis. Relapsing-remitting MS accounts for 85% of initial presentations.\n\nVariants include primary progressive MS (~10% at onset) presenting after age 40 with slowly worsening myelopathy without clear relapses. Radiologically isolated syndrome features asymptomatic spinal lesions, whereas clinically isolated syndrome may present with an isolated myelitis attack. The median time to secondary progression is 19 years without treatment. Prognostic factors include early incomplete recovery, high lesion load on MRI, and presence of oligoclonal bands. In untreated cases, 50% of RRMS patients convert to secondary progressive MS over 15 years.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: MRI of brain and entire spinal cord with and without gadolinium. Brain MRI sensitivity for MS lesions is 95%, specificity ~80% when using 2017 McDonald criteria (Thompson et al. 2018). Typical findings include ovoid periventricular lesions, juxtacortical U-fiber involvement, and discrete cervical spinal cord T2 hyperintensities less than two segments. CSF analysis for oligoclonal IgG bands has sensitivity 85\u201395% and specificity 86\u201391%. Visual evoked potentials show delayed P100 latency in 60% of clinically isolated syndrome cases. \n\nSecond-tier: Serum AQP4 and MOG antibody testing to exclude NMOSD/MOGAD if lesions are longitudinally extensive. Neurophysiology (SSEP) may support demyelination. Infectious and metabolic panels (B12, HIV, syphilis) are tailored to pretest probability.\n\nAccording to AAN guidelines (2018), the combination of dissemination in space and time on MRI, CSF, and evoked potentials yields Level A diagnostic confidence. Diagnostic pitfalls include transverse myelitis from other causes, small vessel ischemic disease in elderly, and compressive lesions requiring surgical referral.","management_principles":"Acute relapse treatment: high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days (Class I, Level A) per CMSC guidelines (2019), reducing relapse duration and severity. Plasma exchange (five sessions over 10 days) is indicated for steroid-refractory relapses (Class II, Level B). \n\nDisease-modifying therapies: First-line agents include interferon beta formulations and glatiramer acetate, reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR) by ~30% and new MRI lesion formation by 50% (PRISMS trial). Oral agents such as dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide show ARR reduction ~50%. Second-line therapies: natalizumab reduces ARR by 68% (AFFIRM trial), but carries risk of PML. Ocrelizumab for RMS and primary progressive MS reduces ARR by 46% vs. interferon (OPERA I/II). Treatment choice is guided by efficacy, safety, patient preference, and JC virus serostatus. Monitoring includes liver function, blood counts, and annual MRI for disease activity.\n\nNon-pharmacological: Physical therapy for spasticity management, occupational therapy, and symptomatic treatments for neuropathic pain (e.g., gabapentin). Rehabilitation should begin early in relapse recovery.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients on DMT should have clinical evaluations every 6 to 12 months, including EDSS scoring. MRI surveillance of brain and spinal cord is recommended annually or upon new clinical symptoms. Laboratory monitoring varies by agent: CBC and LFTs every 3\u20136 months for interferons and oral agents; immunoglobulin levels and infusion reactions monitoring for monoclonal antibodies. Long-term treatment is recommended for at least five years in most patients; early discontinuation increases risk of rebound disease activity. Transition of care to primary neurology clinic involves education on relapse recognition, adherence monitoring, and lifestyle optimization. Prognostic factors guiding follow-up intensity include high lesion burden, gadolinium enhancement at baseline, and incomplete relapse recovery. Rehabilitation assessments every 6 months can help track functional status and adjust therapies.","clinical_pearls":"1. Lhermitte Phenomenon: Electric shock\u2013like sensations on neck flexion; present in ~40% of MS myelitis cases and high-yield for board exams. 2. Oligoclonal Bands: Their presence in CSF (not serum) strongly supports MS diagnosis (sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~80%), distinguishing it from NMOSD. 3. Cervical Cord Involvement: Spinal lesions in MS are usually <2 vertebral segments; longitudinally extensive lesions suggest NMOSD or sarcoidosis. 4. Early DMT Initiation: Starting high-efficacy therapy after first relapse reduces long-term disability accrual (hazard ratio 0.46 in early vs. delayed treatment). 5. Differential Testing: In atypical myelitis, always test AQP4 and MOG antibodies to avoid misdiagnosis and guide therapy; NMOSD requires immunosuppression rather than interferon beta.","references":"1.
