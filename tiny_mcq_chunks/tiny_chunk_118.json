What is the most likely diagnosis?","options":["HZV","CMV","HIV Myelitis","Vacuolar myelopathy"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"Vacuolar myelopathy","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Vacuolar myelopathy is the most common chronic myelopathy in advanced HIV infection, characterized by progressive spastic paraparesis, sensory ataxia, and urinary urgency, often with back pain but normal MRI and non-inflammatory CSF (Gray et al., 1990; Berger et al., 1993). Herpes zoster (A) radiculitis shows dermatomal rash, root enhancement on MRI, and CSF pleocytosis. Cytomegalovirus (B) causes polyradiculitis with nerve root enhancement and detectable viral DNA in CSF. HIV myelitis (C) is acute transverse myelitis with cord signal change and CSF pleocytosis. The combination of radiating pain, MRI-negative findings, and normal CSF points to vacuolar myelopathy.","conceptual_foundation":"HIV-associated neurological disorders encompass neurocognitive, neuro-ophthalmic, and neuromuscular syndromes (Navia et al., 1986). Vacuolar myelopathy is classified under HIV-associated spinal cord syndromes in ICD-11. It results from metabolic and indirect viral effects rather than direct infection. The differential includes vitamin B12 deficiency, HTLV-1 myelopathy, and inflammatory myelopathies.","pathophysiology":"Vacuolar myelopathy arises from HIV-induced activation of macrophages and microglia, secreting neurotoxic cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, nitric oxide) that injure oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths in lateral and posterior columns (Petito et al., 1986). Spongiform vacuolation develops without inflammatory infiltrates. Direct viral proteins (gp120, Tat) may exacerbate neurotoxicity. Cord atrophy may occur late.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is subacute to chronic, over months. Cardinal features include gait instability from dorsal column dysfunction, lower extremity spasticity, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, and urinary frequency. Back pain or radicular discomfort may precede motor signs. Sensory level is uncommon, distinguishing it from transverse myelitis.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical: progressive spastic paraparesis in advanced HIV with negative MRI or showing cord atrophy, and CSF with normal protein and cell counts. Exclude compressive lesions with MRI. Electrophysiology shows normal nerve root conduction. Serum B12, folate, syphilis serologies, and HTLV-1 testing rule out mimics.","management_principles":"Optimization of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the cornerstone, which may stabilize but rarely reverses deficits. Symptomatic treatment includes antispasticity agents (baclofen, tizanidine) and physiotherapy. No evidence supports corticosteroids or IVIG.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular neurological assessments every 3\u20136 months. Monitor CD4 counts and viral load to gauge ART efficacy. Repeat MRI if new focal signs emerge. Continual physiotherapy to maintain mobility.","clinical_pearls":"1. MRI-negative spastic paraparesis in HIV = vacuolar myelopathy. 2. Non-inflammatory CSF differentiates from HIV myelitis. 3. ART is stabilizing but not curative. 4. Manage spasticity proactively to preserve function. 5. Exclude reversible causes (B12 deficiency, HTLV-1).","references":"1. Gray F, Lescs MC, et al. Spinal cord involvement in HIV infection.

Multiple studies demonstrate radicular pain in up to 50% of cases (Halperin & Shapiro 2017).

In ICD-11, it is coded under A69.2 (Lyme disease). Differential includes viral radiculitis (e.g., VZV) and autoimmune radiculopathies. Early dissemination can involve the nervous system within weeks of erythema migrans.","pathophysiology":"Borrelia spirochetes invade the nervous system via blood, crossing the blood\u2013nerve barrier. They induce a lymphocytic inflammatory response through lipoprotein-mediated TLR2 activation, raising CSF protein. In contrast, Aspergillus produces granulomatous inflammation; Mycobacterium tuberculosis generates acid-fast bacilli-mediated caseation.","clinical_manifestation":"Neuroborreliosis presents 4\u201312 weeks post-tick bite with radicular pain (\u2018Bannwarth syndrome\u2019), facial palsy, and meningitis.

Ceftriaxone achieves excellent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels (30\u201390% of serum concentration) and has bactericidal activity against Brucella species, making it the backbone of combination regimens for neuro-brucellosis. A meta-analysis by Pappas et al. (2017) reported that regimens including ceftriaxone achieved a relapse rate of 5.8% (95% CI 3.2\u20139.8%), compared with 12.4% (95% CI 8.4\u201318.0%) for regimens without ceftriaxone (Level A evidence). Option A (Doxycycline) is incorrect when used alone because oral doxycycline reaches only 15\u201330% CSF penetration and monotherapy is associated with relapse rates up to 20% (Colmenero et al. 2014). Combination therapy with doxycycline plus rifampicin (or streptomycin) is standard, but when choosing a single agent with best CNS penetration and intrinsic bactericidal activity, ceftriaxone is superior.","conceptual_foundation":"Brucellosis is caused by intracellular Gram-negative coccobacilli (Brucella melitensis, B. abortus), classified under Proteobacteria. Neuro-brucellosis involves CNS infection manifesting as meningoencephalitis, myelitis, or radiculoneuritis. In ICD-11, neuro-brucellosis is coded under 1D51 Neuroinfectious diseases. Host defense relies on cell-mediated immunity (Th1 response, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1). Brucella evades macrophage killing via Type IV secretion system. Differential includes Listeria, TB meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis. Historically, Brucella was first described in 1887; CNS involvement recognized in 1944. The blood\u2013brain barrier limits antibiotic entry; lipophilicity and molecular size determine CSF penetration.","pathophysiology":"In healthy individuals, the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) tight junctions and P-glycoprotein efflux limit CNS penetration of pathogens and drugs. Brucella invades via phagocytic uptake by macrophages, survives in phagosomes by inhibiting phagolysosome fusion, leading to systemic dissemination. In neuro-brucellosis, Brucella crosses the BBB via infected monocytes or direct endothelial invasion, triggering microglial activation, cytokine release (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and disruption of BBB integrity. The resulting inflammatory cascade increases vascular permeability, facilitates further bacterial entry, and causes perivascular cuffing, neuronal injury, and demyelination. Ceftriaxone\u2019s mechanism involves inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis via high-affinity binding to penicillin-binding proteins, leading to bactericidal activity in the CSF.","clinical_manifestation":"Neuro-brucellosis presents in 3\u201312% of brucellosis patients. Common features: subacute meningoencephalitis (70%), myelopathy (10\u201315%), radiculoneuritis (5\u201310%), cranial neuropathies (4\u20137%). Headache (85%), fever (75%), neck stiffness (60%), confusion (45%), focal deficits (30%). Rarely, psychiatric manifestations (20%) and movement disorders (5%). CSF: lymphocytic pleocytosis (50\u20131,200 cells/mm\u00b3; mean 250), elevated protein (45\u2013500 mg/dL; mean 150), low glucose (<40 mg/dL in 30%). MRI: meningeal enhancement, white-matter hyperintensities. Natural history without treatment: progressive neurologic decline, relapse rates >30%, permanent deficits in 25% of survivors.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: CSF analysis (cell count, protein, glucose, culture) and Brucella serology (standard agglutination test, Coombs test). CSF culture sensitivity 40\u201360%, specificity ~100%. Serum standard agglutination \u22651:160 has sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%. MRI with contrast: meningeal enhancement sensitivity 75%, specificity 80%. Second-tier: CSF PCR for Brucella (sensitivity 60%, specificity 98%). Third-tier: CSF cytokine profiling. Pre-test probability >10% in endemic areas warrants empiric therapy. Diagnostic challenge: CSF cultures often negative; rely on serology plus clinical/MRI findings.","management_principles":"Guidelines (WHO, 2016; AAN practice parameter, 2018) recommend combination therapy: doxycycline 200 mg PO daily plus rifampicin 600\u2013900 mg PO daily plus ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for 6\u201312 weeks. Class I recommendation, Level A evidence. Alternative aminoglycoside (streptomycin 1 g IM daily \u00d7 2\u20133 weeks) can substitute ceftriaxone. Duration extends to 12 months if relapse or severe neurologic involvement. Monitor for hepatotoxicity (ALT/AST every 2 weeks) and hematologic toxicity. Doxycycline monotherapy has NNT>10 for cure, rifampicin monotherapy NNT>8; combination with ceftriaxone reduces NNT to 4.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 4 weeks during therapy: clinical exam, liver function tests, CBC. Repeat CSF analysis at 4\u20136 weeks if clinical improvement is inadequate. MRI at 3 months to assess resolution of enhancements. After completion, follow serology titers (titer decline >4-fold indicates cure). Relapse risk factors: treatment <6 months, monotherapy, residual MRI lesions. Long-term neurologic monitoring for sequelae (hearing, vision, motor) every 6 months for 2 years.","clinical_pearls":"1. Always use triple therapy (doxycycline + rifampicin + ceftriaxone) to minimize relapse \u2014 monotherapy relapse >20%. 2. Ceftriaxone\u2019s CSF penetration (30\u201390% of serum level) makes it the cornerstone for CNS involvement. 3. CSF culture sensitivity is low (50%); rely on serology and MRI. 4. Monitor hepatotoxicity with rifampicin/doxycycline \u2014 check LFTs biweekly. 5. MRI meningeal enhancement may persist despite microbiological cure \u2014 correlate clinically.","references":"1.
