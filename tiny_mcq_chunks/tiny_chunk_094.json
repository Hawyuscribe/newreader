A brain computed tomography (CT) shows no clear hypodensity but subtle early ischemic changes in the basal ganglia and insular ribbon. What should be done next?","options":["Labetalol","Thrombolysis","Thrombectomy"],"subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2022","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Thrombolysis","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: B) Thrombolysis\n\nThrombolysis, specifically the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), is the preferred treatment for acute ischemic stroke when a patient presents within the therapeutic window of 3 hours from symptom onset. In this scenario, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 20, indicating a moderate to severe stroke. The non-contrast CT scan reveals no hemorrhage but shows subtle early ischemic changes, supporting the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke. \n\nAdditionally, her blood pressure (180/100 mm Hg) is below the critical threshold of 185/110 mm Hg, which allows for the administration of tPA without immediate antihypertensive intervention. This makes her an ideal candidate for thrombolysis, aligning with current stroke management guidelines that advocate for rapid intervention to restore cerebral blood flow and minimize neurological damage.\n\nOption A: Labetalol\n\nWhile labetalol can be used to manage hypertension, it is not the immediate step in this scenario. The patient's blood pressure, although elevated, does not exceed the threshold that would necessitate treatment before administering tPA. The focus in the acute setting is to treat the stroke rather than secondary complications of hypertension, assuming the patient\u2019s blood pressure remains manageable.\n\nOption C: Thrombectomy\n\nThrombectomy is recommended for patients with large vessel occlusions, typically identified through advanced imaging techniques such as CT angiography or MR angiography. In this scenario, the patient has not undergone such imaging, and the brain CT does not indicate the presence of a large vessel occlusion that would warrant this intervention. While thrombectomy is a crucial component of stroke management, it would be considered after assessing the vascular status and in cases where thrombolysis is either contraindicated or ineffective.\n\n###","conceptual_foundation":"The management of acute ischemic stroke revolves around the timely restoration of cerebral blood flow to salvage brain tissue and prevent irreversible damage. The cornerstone of acute treatment is thrombolysis with tPA, which acts by dissolving the clot obstructing the cerebral artery. This restoration of blood flow can significantly improve outcomes in terms of functional recovery and survival rates.\n\nThe NIHSS score is an important clinical tool used to quantify the severity of stroke symptoms and guide treatment decisions. An NIHSS score of 20 indicates significant neurological impairment, highlighting the urgency of intervention.\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend thrombolysis within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset, depending on specific criteria and patient characteristics. The use of imaging to rule out hemorrhagic stroke is critical before proceeding with thrombolytics due to the risk of exacerbating bleeding in the brain.\n\n###","pathophysiology":"Acute ischemic stroke occurs when blood supply to a region of the brain is interrupted, leading to a cascade of pathological events. Neurons and glial cells begin to undergo metabolic failure due to the lack of oxygen and glucose. This process can lead to cell death through necrosis or apoptosis, with the penumbra representing the surrounding tissue at risk but not yet irreversibly damaged.\n\nThe initial insult triggers several pathophysiological mechanisms, including excitotoxicity from excess neurotransmitters (especially glutamate), oxidative stress from free radicals, and inflammation. The early ischemic changes seen on CT reflect these processes, including cytotoxic edema and the beginning of tissue necrosis, which can be detected even before significant hypodensity appears.\n\n###","clinical_manifestation":"The clinical presentation of acute ischemic stroke can vary widely depending on the affected brain region. Common signs and symptoms include:\n\n- Sudden onset of weakness or numbness, particularly on one side of the body (hemiparesis).\n- Difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia).\n- Visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision.\n- Loss of coordination or balance.\n\nIn this case, the patient presents with a significant NIHSS score of 20, indicating she likely exhibits severe motor and possibly sensory deficits, along with potential speech difficulties and loss of coordination.\n\n###","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic workup for suspected stroke includes:\n\n1. Non-Contrast CT Scan: This initial imaging modality is critical in ruling out hemorrhagic stroke and identifying early ischemic changes.\n2. CT Angiography or MR Angiography: These imaging studies may be performed to evaluate for large vessel occlusions that could indicate a need for thrombectomy.\n3. Laboratory Tests: Basic labs may include glucose levels, complete blood count, and coagulation studies.\n\nEarly recognition of stroke symptoms and quick diagnostic evaluation are essential to ensure timely management. Differential diagnoses can include transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), intracerebral hemorrhage, or other neurological conditions presenting with similar symptoms.\n\n###","management_principles":"The management of acute ischemic stroke can be broken down into several key principles:\n\n- Thrombolysis with tPA: Administered within the therapeutic window, tPA is indicated for eligible patients to dissolve the occluding thrombus.\n- Blood Pressure Management: While acute hypertension is common in stroke patients, it should only be treated if it exceeds the threshold for tPA administration or is causing significant complications.\n- Post-Management Care: After thrombolysis, patients require close monitoring for potential complications, including hemorrhagic transformation or neurological deterioration.\n\nIn this scenario, the next best step is to initiate thrombolysis after confirming eligibility.\n\n###","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitoring and follow-up are crucial in the management of stroke patients:\n\n1. Neurological Monitoring: Continuous assessment of neurological status to detect any deterioration or complications.\n2. Blood Pressure Control: Regular monitoring of blood pressure, particularly in the first 24 hours post-tPA.\n3. Rehabilitation Services: Early involvement of rehabilitation services is important for optimizing recovery.\n\nPrognosis after thrombolysis can vary significantly based on the extent of the initial stroke, the presence of comorbid conditions, and the timeliness of intervention.\n\n###","clinical_pearls":"- \"Time is Brain\": The mantra emphasizes the importance of rapid intervention in stroke management, as every minute lost can lead to significant neuronal loss.\n- NIHSS Score: Understanding the implications of the NIHSS score can guide treatment decisions and predict outcomes.\n- Blood Pressure Thresholds: Remember the critical thresholds for tPA administration (185/110 mm Hg); patients must be treated within strict guidelines to avoid complications.\n\n###","references":"- American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.

Her blood pressure (180/100 mm Hg) is below the 185/110 threshold; therefore, no immediate antihypertensive intervention is required before tPA. Mechanical thrombectomy (Option C) is indicated for large vessel occlusions on vascular imaging, but the first step in the absence of contraindications is IV alteplase.

CTA has a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98% for detecting large vessel occlusions (Smith et al., Stroke 2019). Option B (EEG) is incorrect because EEG evaluates electrical brain activity and does not visualize vascular occlusions; it is not used in the acute stroke setting for diagnosing basilar thrombosis.","conceptual_foundation":"Basilar artery thrombosis is classified under acute ischemic stroke in ICD-11 (8A80) and involves thromboembolic occlusion of the basilar artery at the vertebrobasilar junction. The basilar artery is formed by the confluence of the two vertebral arteries in the prepontine cistern. It supplies the pons, cerebellum, and occipital lobes via paramedian, circumferential, and superior cerebellar branches. Thrombosis in this vessel leads to pontine ischemia and can rapidly progress to coma, decerebrate posturing, and 'locked\u2010in' syndrome.","pathophysiology":"Normal basilar flow (\u2248150 mL/min) is essential for perfusion of the brainstem and cerebellum. Thrombotic occlusion leads to cessation of nutrient and oxygen delivery, energy failure, ion pump dysfunction, cytotoxic edema, and neuronal death. In basilar artery thrombosis, bilateral pontine infarction disrupts corticospinal tracts, causing decerebrate posturing via loss of cortical inhibition on pontine and medullary reticulospinal pathways.","clinical_manifestation":"Presentation includes acute onset of dizziness, vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, ataxia, progressing rapidly to decreased consciousness and signs of brainstem dysfunction (decerebrate posturing, absent pupillary reflexes). Mortality without reperfusion exceeds 90%, and survivors have high rates of severe disability.","diagnostic_approach":"The noncontrast head CT hyperdense basilar sign has high specificity (~93%) but lower sensitivity (~46%). CTA is the recommended next step per AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level B-R) to confirm occlusion, evaluate collateral flow, and plan mechanical thrombectomy. Time from last known well to imaging should be under 20 minutes in stroke centers.","management_principles":"After CTA confirmation, immediate endovascular therapy (mechanical thrombectomy) is indicated within 6 hours (Class I, Level A) and up to 24 hours in selected patients (Class IIa, Level B-R) per AHA/ASA. Intravenous alteplase is given within 4.5 hours if no contraindications. Blood pressure management, antiplatelet therapy post\u2010procedure, and intensive care monitoring are essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurological status every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, with follow\u2010up imaging at 24 hours. Start rehabilitation within 48 hours. Long\u2010term secondary prevention includes antithrombotic therapy, statin therapy to target LDL <70 mg/dL, and management of risk factors (hypertension, diabetes).","clinical_pearls":"1) Hyperdense basilar artery on CT is a stroke mimic that demands immediate vascular imaging. 2) Basilar thrombosis often presents with prodromal brainstem symptoms (diplopia, ataxia) before coma. 3) Mechanical thrombectomy has a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2 for favorable outcome in basilar occlusion. 4) Don\u2019t delay CTA for MRI in suspected basilar stroke. 5) Persistent hiccups and respiratory irregularity may be early signs of pontine infarction.","references":"1.

In reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are typically unremarkable aside from mild protein elevation in up to 30% of patients; glucose remains within normal limits. Option A (High protein) is incorrect because marked protein elevation is not characteristic of RCVS and would suggest inflammatory or demyelinating processes. Option B (Oligoclonal bands) is incorrect\u2014oligoclonal bands are a marker of central nervous system inflammation seen in multiple sclerosis or neurosarcoidosis, not RCVS. Option D (Elevated white blood cell count) is incorrect because pleocytosis in RCVS is usually absent or minimal (<5 cells/\u00b5L), whereas significant white cell elevation suggests infectious or inflammatory vasculitis.","conceptual_foundation":"Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is characterized by thunderclap headache and reversible segmental arterial narrowing on angiography without evidence of persistent vasculitis or structural lesion. It falls under the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) as a headache secondary to vascular disorder. Pathologically, RCVS features transient dysfunction of the cerebral arterial tone rather than inflammatory infiltration of vessel walls. Differential diagnoses include primary angiitis of the CNS, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cervical artery dissection\u2014each of which may alter CSF glucose, protein, or cell counts distinctly.","pathophysiology":"Normal CSF glucose in RCVS reflects intact blood\u2013CSF barrier transport and absence of metabolic consumption by inflammatory cells. The underlying mechanism involves transient dysregulation of cerebral vascular tone\u2014endothelial dysfunction, sympathetic overactivity, and oxidative stress\u2014leading to reversible vessel narrowing. There is no breakdown of the blood\u2013CSF barrier sufficient to alter glucose transport, unlike in bacterial meningitis or vasculitic processes.","clinical_manifestation":"RCVS presents with recurrent thunderclap headaches, sometimes accompanied by focal neurological deficits or seizures if infarction or hemorrhage occurs. CSF is typically normal or shows mild protein elevation (<100 mg/dL) without significant pleocytosis. Normal glucose (>50% of serum glucose) is a hallmark that helps differentiate RCVS from inflammatory vasculitides, where glucose may be reduced.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes noncontrast head CT and CT angiography to detect hemorrhage and segmental vasoconstriction. Lumbar puncture is indicated to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage or vasculitis. CSF glucose is measured alongside protein and cell count; normal glucose supports RCVS. Angiographic changes should resolve on repeat imaging at 3 months to confirm reversibility.","management_principles":"Treatment centers on calcium channel blockers (nimodipine or verapamil) to relieve vasoconstriction, along with pain control. Immunosuppressive therapies are not indicated, given the noninflammatory nature of RCVS and normal CSF glucose. Blood pressure control and avoidance of vasoactive substances are also key.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up angiography at 6\u201312 weeks should demonstrate complete resolution of arterial narrowing. No routine repeat lumbar puncture is required if initial CSF studies (including normal glucose) were unremarkable and diagnosis is confirmed radiographically.","clinical_pearls":"1. CSF glucose remains normal in RCVS, distinguishing it from vasculitis. 2. Thunderclap headache with normal CSF points toward RCVS. 3. Angiographic reversibility by 12 weeks confirms diagnosis. 4. Calcium channel blockers relieve symptoms. 5. Avoid glucocorticoids\u2014they may worsen outcome.","references":"1. Calabrese LH et al. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.
