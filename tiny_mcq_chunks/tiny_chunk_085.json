[{"question_number":"3","question":"A young female with a history of stroke and recurrent abortions is evaluated. Which of the following is the most likely underlying condition?","options":["Protein C deficiency","Anti-thrombin III deficiency","Antiphospholipid syndrome","Anti-factor VII deficiency"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Antiphospholipid syndrome","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Protein C deficiency is an inherited thrombophilia affecting 1 in 200\u2013500 individuals. It manifests with venous thromboembolism in 60\u201370% of carriers by age 40. Rarely does it cause recurrent early pregnancy loss; fetal losses reported in under 10% of cases. In a 32-year-old woman with deep venous thrombosis and no obstetric history, one might consider type I or II protein C deficiency. Misconception: equating any hypercoagulable state with recurrent abortions. Guidelines (ACOG 2018) note that isolated protein C deficiency rarely explains late pregnancy losses. Option B: Antithrombin III deficiency occurs in 1 in 2,000\u20135,000 people, presenting with 70\u201380% lifetime risk of venous thrombosis, especially mesenteric and pulmonary emboli. It does not cause arterial stroke in young adults or habitual abortions. A 25-year-old man with recurrent pulmonary emboli on warfarin might be tested for AT III activity (normal range 80\u2013120%). Misconception: believing AT III deficiency prolongs aPTT. In fact, aPTT is often normal. Option C: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the most likely diagnosis, accounting for 10\u201315% of strokes in women under 45 and up to 40% of recurrent fetal losses after 10 weeks\u2019 gestation. The presence of lupus anticoagulant doubles arterial thrombosis risk; anticardiolipin IgG \u226540 GPL units correlates with 50% recurrence at 5 years. APS pathophysiology involves antibodies against \u03b22-glycoprotein I, endothelial activation, and complement C5a generation. This explains both arterial and venous thromboses and placental infarction. Option D: Factor VII deficiency is a bleeding diathesis (incidence 1 in 500,000), leading to prolonged prothrombin time, mucosal bleeding, and menorrhagia. It does not cause thrombosis or stroke. Misconception: mixing factor nomenclature \u2013 factor VII deficiency prolongs PT by 20\u201360%, whereas APS often demonstrates paradoxical prolongation of aPTT in vitro.","conceptual_foundation":"Antiphospholipid syndrome involves cerebral arterial and venous vasculature, particularly small to medium cortical vessels and deep white matter perforators supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The MCA\u2019s superior division supplies frontal eye fields and sensorimotor cortex, while the inferior division serves temporal lobe language areas; thrombosis here produces contralateral hemiparesis or aphasia. Embryologically, the primitive dorsal aorta gives rise to carotid arteries by the fourth week; endothelial cells express \u03b22-glycoprotein I receptors by week eight. Normal regulation includes endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) releasing NO to prevent platelet adhesion. In APS, disrupted balance leads to microthrombi in placental spiral arteries, causing infarcts and fetal hypoxia. Related neurologic conditions include reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome and CADASIL, but APS uniquely combines systemic lupus erythematosus overlap in 30\u201340% of cases. The historical description by Hughes in 1983 coined 'lupus anticoagulant' after observing prolonged coagulation tests despite thrombosis. Key landmarks: the circle of Willis collateralizes flow if one branch occludes, yet APS clogs multiple sites. Recognition of livedo reticularis, chorea, and cognitive dysfunction progressed from single-case reports in the 1950s to cohort studies documenting 35\u201350% stroke recurrence without treatment.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, antiphospholipid antibodies target phospholipid-binding plasma proteins, predominantly \u03b22-glycoprotein I on endothelial surfaces and platelets. Binding to domain I of \u03b22-GPI triggers Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, activating NF-\u03baB and upregulating tissue factor expression by 3- to 5-fold. Complement C3 and C5 convertases assemble on trophoblasts, generating C5a within hours and recruiting neutrophils. Platelet Fc\u03b3RIIa engagement induces granule release of ADP and thromboxane A2, increasing aggregation four-fold. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DR7 and DR4 alleles, with an odds ratio of 2.3 for antibody persistence. Maternal anti-\u03b22-GPI IgG crosses the placenta by 20 weeks\u2019 gestation, causing decidual necrosis and infarcts. Lupus anticoagulant prolongs dilute Russell viper venom time by 30\u201350%, paradoxically signifying in vivo hypercoagulability. Over days to weeks, recurrent microthrombi produce placental insufficiency and cerebral ischemic penumbra formation. Endothelial repair via mobilized endothelial progenitor cells is overwhelmed, limiting revascularization. Regulatory T-cell dysfunction (reduced CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells by 40%) fails to suppress autoreactive B-cells. Persistent oxidative stress with increased intracellular ROS impairs mitochondrial ATP production, compounding microvascular injury within hours of antibody binding.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with APS often present with an acute ischemic stroke featuring sudden-onset weakness evolving over minutes, peaking within one hour. A 28-year-old woman may notice left-sided hemiplegia, facial droop, and dysarthria. Neurological exam reveals left hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response, and right gaze preference. In contrast, pediatric presentation (<18 years) sometimes includes chorea or migraines in 15% of cases. Elderly patients (>65 years) with APS have more frequent cognitive impairment and posterior circulation strokes. Women have an 80% higher risk of pregnancy-related thrombosis than men, and 40\u201350% develop preeclampsia after 20 weeks. Associated systemic signs include livedo reticularis in 25% and thrombocytopenia (<100,000/\u00b5L) in 20%. Severity grading by NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) averages 8\u201312 for moderate strokes. Red flags: repeated fetal losses after 10 weeks, unexplained thrombocytopenia with normal bone marrow. Without treatment, stroke recurrence rates approach 30% at 2 years and fetal loss risk remains 60\u201370%. Extraneurologic manifestations such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and heart valve vegetations occur in 20\u201330% of patients over five years if unrecognized.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial assessment follows a stepwise algorithm: perform dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) with sensitivity 85% and specificity 90% for lupus anticoagulant, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) mixing studies. If aPTT remains prolonged by >1.2\u00d7 normal (normal range 25\u201340 seconds) after 1:1 mixing, suspect inhibitor. Confirm with hexagonal phase phospholipid neutralization assay, sensitivity 78\u201388%. Next, quantify anticardiolipin IgG/IgM antibodies by ELISA; positive threshold \u226540 GPL or MPL units yields 70% sensitivity, 92% specificity. Measure anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I IgG/IgM (\u226599th percentile) with 75% sensitivity. Repeat testing after 12 weeks to fulfill Sydney criteria. Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted sequences shows restricted diffusion in MCA territory. MR angiography may reveal vessel occlusion. Doppler ultrasound assesses lower extremity veins for concurrent DVT. Lab values: platelet count 80,000\u2013150,000/\u00b5L, normal fibrinogen 200\u2013400 mg/dL. CSF analysis is not routinely required but shows no pleocytosis. Electroencephalogram may reveal focal slowing correlating with ischemic lesion. Differential diagnoses include SLE nephritis presenting with hypertension and vasculitis in polyarteritis nodosa showing microaneurysms on angiography. Distinguishing features: APS often has normal C3/C4 complement levels unless coexisting lupus nephritis.","management_principles":"First-line treatment uses vitamin K antagonists targeting INR 2.0\u20133.0. Initiate warfarin with a loading dose of 5 mg daily, adjusted by day 3, then maintenance 2\u201310 mg daily based on INR. For acute cerebral thrombosis, begin low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours) until INR is therapeutic for at least two consecutive days. In pregnancy, warfarin is teratogenic; instead use enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid plus aspirin 81 mg daily. Second-line options include fondaparinux 7.5 mg once daily, especially if heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is suspected. Direct oral anticoagulants are generally contraindicated; rivaroxaban 20 mg daily was associated with 48% higher recurrence in RAPS trial. Hydroxychloroquine at 200\u2013400 mg daily reduces thrombosis risk by 36% according to retrospective cohorts. Non-pharmacological measures: compression stockings (30\u201340 mmHg) reduce post-thrombotic syndrome by 50%. Surgical options for cerebral thrombectomy within 6 hours of onset achieve recanalization in 70% of MCA occlusions. Monitor CBC, liver enzymes, and anti-Xa levels (target 0.6\u20131.0 IU/mL) monthly. In renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), reduce enoxaparin to 1 mg/kg daily. Address bleeding complications with prothrombin complex concentrate (25 IU/kg) if INR >4 and clinically significant bleed.","follow_up_guidelines":"After stabilization, follow-up visits are scheduled at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and then every 3 months. Monitor INR monthly in warfarin users (target 2.0\u20133.0) and anti-Xa levels quarterly in LMWH recipients (target 0.6\u20131.0 IU/mL). Perform Doppler ultrasound of legs every 6 months to detect asymptomatic DVT; incidence in APS is 10% per year. Obtain fetal ultrasounds at 12, 20, and 32 weeks\u2019 gestation; growth restriction occurs in 25% of pregnancies. Annual brain MRI screening is not standard but consider for recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Long-term complications include chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in 4% and diffuse cerebral small vessel disease in 20% after 5 years. Prognosis: 1-year stroke recurrence is 8\u201312%, 5-year recurrence 25\u201330%. Rehabilitation needs include physical and occupational therapy for 6\u201312 months. Patient education covers adherence to anticoagulation, falls prevention, and dietary vitamin K consistency. Driving clearance may resume after 3 months without recurrent events. Recommend APS support groups such as the Antiphospholipid Syndrome Foundation and national thrombosis networks for psychosocial resources.","clinical_pearls":"1. APS is the most common cause of stroke in women under 45 with concurrent recurrent pregnancy loss, accounting for up to 15% of such cases. 2. Paradoxical aPTT prolongation with lupus anticoagulant in vitro coexists with in vivo thrombosis. 3.

His blood pressure is 180/100 mmHg, and his computed tomography (CT) scan shows no hemorrhage with good ASPECT scores. What is your next step in management?","options":["Reduce BP","IV thrombolytic","CTA ## Page 8"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"IV thrombolytic","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B. IV thrombolysis with alteplase is indicated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in acute ischemic stroke patients without hemorrhage on CT scan and who meet inclusion criteria. The NINDS trial (1995) demonstrated a 30% improvement in favorable functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0\u20131) at 3 months (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2\u20132.6). AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines (Class I, Level A) recommend IV alteplase in eligible patients within the window. Option A is incorrect because lowering blood pressure below the threshold (185/110 mmHg) should only occur to meet criteria for tPA, not as the next isolated step. Option C (CTA) may identify large\u2010vessel occlusion and inform endovascular therapy but should not delay initiation of IV thrombolysis, which has a proven mortality and disability benefit when administered promptly.","conceptual_foundation":"An acute ischemic stroke results from sudden occlusion of a cerebral artery, most commonly the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The strategic understanding of stroke classification (TOAST criteria) identifies cardioembolism, large\u2010artery atherosclerosis, small\u2010vessel occlusion (lacune), and other causes. The ischemic penumbra comprises brain tissue that is hypoperfused but still viable and can be salvaged by timely reperfusion. CT imaging is used emergently to exclude hemorrhage (ICH) and to calculate the ASPECTS score, which quantifies early ischemic changes in the MCA territory. An ASPECTS \u22657 correlates with better outcomes post\u2010thrombolysis. Knowledge of stroke timelines (hyperacute <6h, acute up to 24h) and therapeutic windows underpins management.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, cerebral autoregulation maintains constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) across systemic blood pressures of 60\u2013150 mmHg. In ischemic stroke, arterial occlusion halts blood flow, leading to energy depletion, failure of Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase, cellular depolarization, excitotoxic glutamate release, Ca\u00b2\u207a influx, free radical formation, and eventual necrosis in the infarct core within minutes. Surrounding penumbral tissue experiences moderate hypoperfusion, prompting anaerobic metabolism and potentially reversible injury. Timely reperfusion via IV tPA restores perfusion, halts excitotoxic cascades, and salvages the penumbra.","clinical_manifestation":"The patient presents with acute right\u2010sided weakness (hemiparesis) and global aphasia, localizing to the dominant (left) MCA territory. Global aphasia indicates involvement of both Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s areas. There is no headache or altered consciousness, reducing suspicion for hemorrhage. Time of onset (3 hours) falls within the 4.5\u2010hour tPA window. Blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg is below the 185/110 mmHg exclusion threshold; no immediate BP lowering is needed before tPA administration.","diagnostic_approach":"First, perform non\u2010contrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage. ASPECTS scoring \u22657 supports proceeding with tPA. While CT angiography (CTA) can detect large\u2010vessel occlusion and guide endovascular therapy, it should not delay IV tPA. MRI\u2010DWI is more sensitive for early ischemia but is not recommended over CT in the hyperacute setting due to time constraints. Laboratory tests include blood glucose, INR, platelet count to exclude metabolic mimics and bleeding diatheses.","management_principles":"Initiate alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg): 10% as bolus over 1 minute; remainder infused over 60 minutes (Class I, Level A). Maintain blood pressure <180/105 mmHg for the first 24 hours post\u2010tPA using IV labetalol or nicardipine if necessary. Avoid antithrombotic agents for 24 hours post\u2010tPA. For large\u2010vessel occlusion, evaluate for mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours (or up to 24 hours with perfusion imaging in selected patients).","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status every 15 minutes during infusion, every 30 minutes for 6 hours post\u2010infusion, then hourly until 24 hours. Repeat CT scan at 24 hours or sooner if clinical worsening.

T8. Ischemic injury to the anterior spinal artery distribution after aortic surgery typically produces a sensory level in the mid-thoracic region around T8\u2013T10 due to watershed vulnerability. Option A (C2) and B (T4) are too high for the usual watershed zone, and D (L4) is too low, as lumbar enlargement is usually spared.","conceptual_foundation":"The spinal cord\u2019s blood supply derives from the anterior spinal artery fed by segmental radiculomedullary arteries, most importantly the artery of Adamkiewicz arising between T9 and T12. Mid-thoracic segments represent a watershed zone prone to ischemia when segmental inflow is interrupted during aortic repair. Understanding segmental anatomy (ICD-11 code for spinal cord ischemia: 8B51) and collateral circulation is essential.","pathophysiology":"During major aortic repair, interruption of intercostal and lumbar feeders can compromise anterior spinal artery perfusion. The mid-thoracic (T8) region, lying between upper and lower radiculomedullary arteries, suffers first, causing anterior cord syndrome: motor paralysis and loss of pinprick/temperature below the lesion with preserved dorsal column function.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present within hours of surgery with acute paraparesis, hypotonia, areflexia evolving to spasticity, and a sensory level typically at T8.

In a patient presenting within 3 hours of onset of acute ischemic stroke symptoms, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is indicated after hemorrhage is excluded by noncontrast head CT (AHA/ASA 2018 guidelines). Option A (CTA) is not the immediate next step; noncontrast CT is required first to rule out hemorrhage. CTA may be obtained subsequently if large-vessel occlusion is suspected for thrombectomy planning. Option C (Warfarin) is contraindicated in the hyperacute phase and has a slower onset; acute anticoagulation is not first-line for typical ischemic stroke. Option D (CEA, carotid endarterectomy) is only indicated for symptomatic carotid stenosis >70% after stabilization and imaging confirmation, not within the hyperacute window.","conceptual_foundation":"Acute ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion leading to focal brain ischemia. Key concepts include: time-sensitive reperfusion therapy within 4.5 hours (tPA) and up to 24 hours for selected thrombectomy candidates. Classification uses ICD-11 code 8B0Z (cerebral infarction). Differential includes intracerebral hemorrhage and stroke mimics (hypoglycemia, seizure, migraine). The ischemic penumbra concept underlies tPA administration to salvage at-risk tissue. Vascular risk factors (hypertension, atrial fibrillation) should be identified but do not delay tPA if hemorrhage is ruled out.","pathophysiology":"Normal cerebral blood flow is maintained by autoregulation and collateral circulation. In arterial occlusion, interruption of flow causes energy failure and ionic pump dysfunction within minutes, leading to cytotoxic edema. The ischemic core undergoes irreversible infarction, while the surrounding penumbra is partially perfused via collaterals. Thrombolysis with tPA accelerates clot lysis by converting plasminogen to plasmin, restoring perfusion to penumbral tissue and improving functional outcome. Delayed reperfusion risks hemorrhagic transformation and increased permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute ischemic stroke typically presents with sudden focal neurological deficits such as unilateral weakness, speech disturbance, or visual field cut. In this vignette, the patient\u2019s time window of 3 hours places him well within the 4.5-hour threshold for tPA. There are no contraindications mentioned (e.g., recent surgery, bleeding diathesis), supporting immediate thrombolysis once hemorrhage is excluded.","diagnostic_approach":"The first diagnostic test in hyperacute stroke is noncontrast head CT to differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke. CT angiography (CTA) is adjunctive for identifying large-vessel occlusion but should follow CT. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive but less practical acutely. Laboratory tests (INR, glucose, platelet count) are obtained concurrently to ensure safety for tPA.","management_principles":"Intravenous tPA is administered at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg), with 10% given as bolus and the remainder over 60 minutes, per AHA/ASA guidelines (Class I, Level A).

Early mobilization, dysphagia screening, and secondary prevention (statin, antihypertensive, antithrombotic) follow stabilization.","follow_up_guidelines":"Post-tPA, neurological assessments are repeated every 15 minutes during infusion, then hourly for 24 hours. Repeat CT is obtained if neurological deterioration occurs. Long-term secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy, statin therapy, blood pressure control, and lifestyle modification. Carotid imaging and cardiac monitoring for atrial fibrillation are indicated within the first week.","clinical_pearls":"1.

The next best step in management is a contrast echocardiogram (bubble study) to screen for PAVMs. A positive bubble study warrants further evaluation with high-resolution CT pulmonary angiography and consideration of embolization.
