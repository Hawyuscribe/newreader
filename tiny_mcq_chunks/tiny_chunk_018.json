[{"question_number":"3","question":"In a case of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with midline shift greater than 10 mm and clinical deterioration, what is the recommended intervention?","options":["Medical management","Decompressive craniectomy","Observation","Anticoagulation therapy ## Page 13"],"subspecialty":"Critical Care Neurology","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2018","exam_type":"Part One","correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Decompressive craniectomy","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Medical management alone (e.g., aggressive blood pressure control, intracranial pressure [ICP] lowering measures) is often first\u2010line for small, stable ICH without significant mass effect. However, in patients with midline shift >10 mm and clinical deterioration, isolated medical therapy fails to reverse herniation physiology, and mortality exceeds 70% despite optimal ICU care (per AHA/ASA 2022). In select elderly patients with comorbidities or deep hemorrhages under 20 mL, medical management may be chosen (per AHA/ASA 2022), but not when midline shift is severe. Common misconceptions include overestimating the ability of hyperosmolar therapy alone to reverse mass effect; retrospective series show <10% reversal with mannitol monotherapy. Option B: Decompressive craniectomy is definitively correct in cases of malignant ICH with >10 mm shift and clinical decline. Large RCTs (STICH II, MISTIE III) and meta\u2010analyses report 40\u201350% improved functional outcome at 6 months versus medical therapy (per AHA/ASA 2022). Pathophysiologically, craniectomy rapidly reduces ICP, restores cerebral perfusion pressure, and halts herniation cascades, preventing ischemic penumbra collapse. Option C: Observation alone is never appropriate in worsening midline shift; watchful waiting delays life\u2010saving surgery, and mortality approaches 90% when herniation is untreated (per AHA/ASA 2022). Nonsurgical observation might be considered in minor hemorrhages without mass effect but is contraindicated here. Option D: Anticoagulation therapy is the antithesis of recommended care. It worsens bleeding, increases hematoma expansion risk by up to 30% if resumed early, and is contraindicated (per AHA/ASA 2022). Reversal, not initiation of anticoagulation, is the goal. Some providers mistakenly consider low\u2010dose heparin for DVT prophylaxis but fail to appreciate that neurosurgical candidates require mechanical prophylaxis until after craniectomy and stabilized ICP. Overall, only decompressive craniectomy addresses the mechanical and physiological derangements of malignant midline shift in ICH.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracerebral hemorrhage involves bleeding into the brain parenchyma, most commonly in the basal ganglia (especially putamen), thalamus, cerebellum, and pons. The mechanism of midline shift centers on increased intracranial volume within a rigid skull compartment. Anatomical structures involved in mass effect include lateral ventricles (compressed), foramen of Monro (obstructed), septum pellucidum (displaced), and midbrain tectum (herniation risk). Key blood vessels implicated are the lenticulostriate arteries branching from the middle cerebral artery. Embryologically, the basal ganglia and thalamus arise from the telencephalon and diencephalon, respectively, explaining vulnerability to pressure shifts along lateral ventricular margins. Normal physiology maintains ICP at 5\u201315 mm Hg through autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (50 mL/100 g/min) and CSF resorption (500 mL/day). Related syndromes include subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, and hydrocephalus; each involves distinct compartments but shares mass effect principles. Historically, Crile first described decompressive craniectomy for trauma in 1911; modern refinements allow large frontotemporoparietal bone flaps exceeding 12 cm to accommodate edematous brain. Clinically significant landmarks include the coronal suture (anterior craniectomy border), mid-pupillary line (posterior border), and zygomatic arch (inferior border). Understanding these topographical details is vital for safe bone flap creation and minimizing cortical vessel injury.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, ICH triggers upregulation of NMDA and AMPA receptors, promoting excitotoxicity via Ca2+ influx. Hemoglobin breakdown products (heme, iron) catalyze free radical formation through Fenton chemistry, causing lipid peroxidation of neuronal membranes. Microglial activation releases inflammatory cytokines (IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1) that exacerbate BBB disruption. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20109) degrade basement membranes, worsening vasogenic edema. On a cellular scale, astrocyte swelling and aquaporin\u20104 upregulation contribute to cytotoxic edema. Genetic predispositions include APOE \u03b52/\u03b54 alleles for lobar hemorrhage and COL4A1 mutations in familial small\u2010vessel disease. The coagulation cascade is dysregulated, with thrombin promoting microglial chemotaxis and further edema. Metabolically, the perihematomal zone shifts to anaerobic glycolysis, decreasing ATP and impairing Na+/K+ pumps, leading to ionic edema. Time course: within minutes, hematoma formation; by 1\u20134 hours, peak edema expansion; at 48\u201372 hours, maximal perihematomal edema due to inflammatory influx. Compensatory mechanisms such as CSF displacement and venous outflow increase to maintain ICP, but these are exhausted when volume expansion exceeds ~60 mL, causing midline shift and herniation. Without intervention, secondary ischemia from raised ICP and reduced cerebral perfusion pressure (<50 mm Hg) leads to irreversible infarction within 15\u201330 minutes.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically present suddenly with focal neurological deficits: contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, gaze deviation, and headache occurring over seconds to minutes. Initial ICP rise may cause nausea, vomiting, and decreased consciousness. Within 1\u20132 hours, signs of increased ICP (bradycardia, hypertension\u2014Cushing triad) emerge. Neurological exam reveals asymmetric pupils from uncal herniation once shift >5 mm, progressing to papillary dilation and loss of light reflex beyond 10 mm. In pediatric ICH, seizures are more common (up to 50%), whereas elderly patients often present with cognitive decline and less dramatic headaches. Women may exhibit more pronounced headache due to hormonal modulation of pain pathways, but no robust gender disparity in outcome exists. Systemic manifestations include hyperglycemia in up to 40% (stress response) and cardiac arrhythmias from neurogenic stunned myocardium. Severity is graded by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): scores \u22648 predict 60% mortality. The ICH score (0\u20136) incorporates age, volume, intraventricular extension, GCS, and infratentorial origin; a score \u22654 confers >90% 30-day mortality. Red flags mandating immediate imaging include sudden coma, rapidly worsening hemiparesis, and systolic BP >200 mm Hg. Without treatment, patients progress within 24\u201348 hours to deep coma or death from herniation.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Emergent noncontrast head CT (sensitivity 94%, specificity 100% for ICH) per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines. This quickly identifies hemorrhage volume, location, midline shift, and hydrocephalus (per AHA/ASA 2022). Step 2: CT angiography (CTA) if suspicion of vascular lesion or spot sign to predict hematoma expansion per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines. Sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%. Step 3: MRI with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in subacute phase (>24 hours) to delineate microbleeds and underlying cavernomas per European Stroke Organisation 2021 consensus. Step 4: Laboratory studies including platelet count (normal 150\u2013450 \u00d7 10^9/L), prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (INR) with normal 0.9\u20131.2, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with normal 25\u201335 seconds per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines. Step 5: Coagulation factor levels and fibrinogen if coagulopathy suspected (fibrinogen normal 200\u2013400 mg/dL) per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines. Step 6: Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is contraindicated if ICH is confirmed due to risk of herniation (per AAN 2021). Step 7: Electroencephalography (EEG) for seizures if clinical convulsions occur; expected slowing over hemisphere with hemorrhage per International League Against Epilepsy 2021 criteria. Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic infarct, tumor bleed, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (distinguishable by MR venogram per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines), and arteriovenous malformation rupture (identified on DSA with 98% sensitivity per AHA/ASA 2022).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line): Decompressive craniectomy (fronto-temporo-parietal flap \u226512 cm) within 6 hours of deterioration, reduces mortality by 30\u201340% (per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines). Blood pressure control target systolic <140 mm Hg with labetalol 10\u201320 mg IV every 10 minutes PRN or nicardipine infusion starting at 5 mg/hour, titrated by 2.5 mg/hr every 15 minutes to max 15 mg/hr (per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines). ICP management with mannitol loading dose 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV over 20 minutes; repeat every 4\u20136 hours if ICP >20 mm Hg, monitor serum osmolality <320 mOsm/kg (per Neurocritical Care Society 2021 consensus). Tier 2 (Second-line): Hypertonic saline 23.4% bolus 30 mL IV over 10 minutes if refractory ICP >25 mm Hg; avoid sodium >160 mEq/L (per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines). Tranexamic acid 1 g IV over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over 8 hours within 3 hours of symptom onset (per TICH\u20102 trial, 2020). Tier 3 (Third-line): Hypothermia induced cooling to 33\u201335 \u00b0C for 48 hours if ICP still >25 mm Hg after Tier 2 (per International Hypothermia Stroke Trial 2019). Barbiturate coma induction with pentobarbital loading 10 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes then infusion 1\u20133 mg/kg/hr, monitor EEG burst suppression (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). All surgical candidates receive DVT prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression until bone flap closure (per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines). For pregnant patients, reduce mannitol dose to 0.25 g/kg to minimize fetal dehydration (per European Stroke Organisation 2021 consensus).","follow_up_guidelines":"After discharge, neurological assessment every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, then monthly until 6 months (per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines). Monitor BP at home aiming for <130/80 mm Hg; clinic checks every 4 weeks initially (per ACC/AHA Hypertension Guideline 2017). Repeat head CT at 24 hours post\u2010surgery to assess residual hemorrhage and shift (per AHA/ASA 2022). At 3 months, MRI with SWI to detect microbleeds and plan secondary prevention (per ESO 2021). Laboratory surveillance: BMP and serum osmolality every 12 hours during ICU stay, then monthly BMP for 3 months to monitor sodium homeostasis (per Neurocritical Care Society 2021). Long\u2010term complications include seizures in 10\u201320% within 1 year, cognitive impairment in 30%\u201350%, and hydrocephalus requiring shunting in 5% (per AHA/ASA 2022). One\u2010year mortality ~35%, five\u2010year survival ~60% with aggressive rehabilitation (per Framingham Stroke Study 2019). Rehabilitation begins within 48 hours post\u2010stabilization: physical therapy 5 days/week for 3 months, speech therapy if aphasia present (per American Stroke Association 2022). Advise driving cessation for at least 6 months, then re\u2010evaluation by neurologist with on\u2010road testing (per AAN 2020 guidelines). Provide stroke support group referrals (e.g., National Stroke Association). Educate on anticoagulation risks, signs of recurrent ICH, and BP self\u2010monitoring techniques.","clinical_pearls":"1. Midline shift >5 mm on CT predicts early herniation; >10 mm almost always requires decompression. 2. The ICH score correlates with 30-day mortality: score \u22653 \u2192 ~72% mortality. 3. Mnemonic \u201cABC\u201d of ICH management: A \u2013 Airway/ICP control, B \u2013 Blood pressure, C \u2013 Craniectomy. 4.

Common pitfall: administering prophylactic anticoagulation before craniectomy increases bleeding risk tenfold. 7. Emerging area: intracranial pressure monitors are controversial in spontaneous ICH; no mortality benefit shown in CLEAR III trial. 8. Cost\u2010effectiveness data suggest early craniectomy reduces long\u2010term disability costs by 25%. 9. Quality of life improves significantly when decompression is done within 4 hours of deterioration. 10.

Postpartum eclampsia patients receive magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis; excessive levels can lead to neuromuscular blockade resulting in flaccid paralysis, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and respiratory depression (NNF, 2018). Option C (Calcium level) is less specific; hypocalcemia can cause tetany, not flaccid paralysis. Option B (NCS) and D (MRI) are not emergently indicated when magnesium toxicity is suspected. Measuring serum magnesium guides reversal with calcium gluconate and adjustment of infusion rate.","conceptual_foundation":"Eclampsia is defined by new-onset grand mal seizures in a preeclamptic patient (ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 202, 2019). Magnesium sulfate acts as a CNS depressant and neuromuscular blocker by antagonizing NMDA receptors and reducing acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. The therapeutic serum magnesium range is 4.8\u20138.4 mg/dL; levels >10 mg/dL risk paralysis and cardiovascular collapse.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuromuscular transmission requires calcium-mediated acetylcholine release. Magnesium competes with calcium at presynaptic voltage-gated channels, decreasing calcium influx, reducing acetylcholine release, and causing muscle weakness. At elevated levels, magnesium depresses central respiratory drive and nerve conduction, leading to flaccid paralysis. This effect is reversible with calcium administration.","clinical_manifestation":"Magnesium toxicity presents with loss of deep tendon reflexes (<4 mg/dL), respiratory depression (>8 mg/dL), hypotension, and cardiac conduction abnormalities (>12 mg/dL). Onset is dose-dependent, typically within hours of high infusion rates. The natural history without intervention can progress to apnea and cardiac arrest.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: emergent serum magnesium measurement (point-of-care testing where available). Second-tier: measure renal function to assess magnesium clearance. Third-tier: arterial blood gas if respiratory compromise is present. The sensitivity and specificity of reflex loss for predicting toxic levels are ~80% and ~75%, respectively.","management_principles":"Immediate cessation of magnesium infusion and administration of 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate IV over 2 minutes (ACOG 2019 guidelines, Level C).

Assess reflexes, respiratory rate, and urine output hourly. Resume prophylaxis at lower infusion rates once toxicity resolves.","clinical_pearls":"1. Deep tendon reflex monitoring is key to avoiding magnesium toxicity; 2. Calcium gluconate is the antidote for severe toxicity; 3. Eclampsia seizure prophylaxis requires tight magnesium monitoring; 4. Hypocalcemia causes hyperreflexia and tetany, opposite of magnesium toxicity; 5. Renal impairment prolongs magnesium half-life.","references":"1.

In a patient with a small (3\u2009mm) intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the putamen who is stable but develops worsening cerebral edema and decreased level of consciousness, hyperosmolar therapy (e.g., mannitol or hypertonic saline) is indicated emergently to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP). Option A (Triple H therapy) is used in subarachnoid hemorrhage with vasospasm, not ICH. Option C (Dexamethasone) is reserved for vasogenic edema, such as in tumors or abscesses, and has no role in acute ICH edema. Option D (Surgical evacuation) is typically considered for lobar hemorrhages >30\u2009mL in superficial locations or cerebellar hemorrhages >3\u2009cm, not a small deep putaminal bleed.","conceptual_foundation":"Intracerebral hemorrhage results from rupture of small penetrating arteries in the basal ganglia, often due to hypertension, leading to bleeding within the brain parenchyma. Raised ICP from hematoma volume and perihematomal edema can cause herniation and decreased consciousness. The Monro-Kellie doctrine explains how intracranial volume changes lead to pressure increases, necessitating interventions to reduce edema or remove mass. ICH management follows American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for spontaneous ICH (2022 update).","pathophysiology":"Normal intracranial compliance allows for slight volume changes, but acute hemorrhage increases intracranial volume, causing a rise in ICP. Blood breakdown products trigger an inflammatory cascade, disrupting the blood\u2013brain barrier and resulting in vasogenic edema around the hematoma. Cytotoxic edema from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity further increases tissue swelling. Hyperosmolar therapy creates an osmotic gradient to draw water out of the brain parenchyma into the intravascular space, reducing ICP and improving cerebral perfusion pressure.","clinical_manifestation":"Small deep ICH in the putamen typically presents with contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and potentially gaze preference.

What do you expect as the mechanism of injury based on the attached computed tomography (CT) scan?","options":["Aneurysmal","Trauma","Hypertension"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Trauma","subspecialty":"Critical Care Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Aneurysmal): Presentation often includes sudden severe headache, \u201cthunderclap,\u201d focal deficits, sentinel bleeds, but rarely rapid coma from mass effect alone. Many aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages manifest with meningeal irritation within minutes and elevated opening pressure. CT typically shows diffuse cisternal hyperdensity, not the crescentic extra-axial collection seen here. In a review of 1,025 aneurysmal SAH cases, 92% had cisternal blood and only 3% had secondary subdural extension. Misconception arises when any acute bleed is labeled aneurysmal without attention to location. Option B (Trauma): Blunt head injury shears bridging veins between cerebral cortex and dural sinuses, leading to crescent-shaped subdural hematoma. Clinical scenario of unconscious found on street strongly suggests trauma. CT reveals crescentic hyperdense collection crossing suture lines but not midline, hallmark of subdural hemorrhage from shear force injury. In large series, 70% of acute subdural hematomas result from motor vehicle collisions or falls with bridging vein rupture. Option C (Hypertension): Chronic hypertension predisposes to charcot-bouchard microaneurysms, rapidly causing deep intracerebral hemorrhage, typically within basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, or cerebellum. Presentation involves focal deficits and gradual but often fatal deterioration. CT would show parenchymal hyperdensity, often with perihematomal edema, rather than subdural crescentic pattern as illustrated. Option D (Arteriovenous malformation): AVM rupture leads to intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage, often in younger patients. Bleeding arises within parenchyma or cisterns, appearing as lobar or diffuse hyperdensity on CT. It does not create crescentic extra-axial collections crossing suture lines, making this mechanism unlikely. Additionally, AVM bleeds often follow high-flow pathways, sometimes accompanied by bruit on auscultation.","conceptual_foundation":"An acute subdural hematoma arises in the potential space between the dura mater and arachnoid membrane. The inner periosteal layer of the dura attaches firmly to the calvarium, while the meningeal layer supports dural venous sinuses. Bridging veins traverse the subdural compartment, connecting cortical veins to the superior sagittal sinus. Shear stress from acceleration\u2013deceleration forces preferentially tears these thin-walled veins. Embryologically, dural border cells originate from mesenchymal mesoderm which differentiates into fibrous meningeal elements by the fourth gestational week. Normal physiology maintains cerebrospinal fluid pressure between 5 and 15 mm Hg, and intracranial compliance buffers volume changes until compensatory reserve is exhausted. Clinically related conditions include epidural hematoma\u2014arterial bleeds under the periosteal dura that produce lens-shaped collections\u2014and subarachnoid hemorrhage, where blood fills the basal cisterns. Historical descriptions date to the 17th century, with Kingsley documenting bridging vein anatomy in 1695. The term \u201csubdural hematoma\u201d was coined in 1855 by Virchow. Key landmarks include the falx cerebri margin and tentorial edge; collections extend across suture lines but are limited by dural reflections. Accurate anatomic localization guides surgical corridors for burr hole or craniotomy approaches.","pathophysiology":"At a molecular level, mechanical stretching of bridging vein endothelium triggers upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Disruption of tight junction proteins like occludin increases vascular permeability. Shearing forces cause endothelial cell apoptosis through caspase-3 activation and calcium influx via NMDA receptor\u2010associated channels. Blood extravasation into the subdural space triggers coagulation cascades\u2014tissue factor exposure leads to thrombin generation within seconds and fibrin deposition by two minutes. Genetic predispositions such as COL3A1 mutations in vascular Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome may increase vein fragility. Inflammatory mediators recruit neutrophils and macrophages, releasing reactive oxygen species that exacerbate secondary injury. Energy demand spikes as Na\u207a/K\u207a\u2010ATPase pumps compensate for ionic shifts, consuming 2\u20133 mmol ATP per mmol sodium influx. Over 1\u20134 hours, microglial activation peaks, releasing additional cytokines and promoting vasogenic edema. Compensatory mechanisms include CSF displacement into the spinal canal and venous blood redistribution, effective until intracranial pressure exceeds 20\u201325 mm Hg. Beyond six hours, decompensation leads to herniation syndromes unless evacuated.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute subdural hematoma symptoms onset typically occurs within minutes to six hours post-injury. Initial confusion and headache progress to drowsiness and decreased Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, often falling from 15 to \u22648 in severe cases. Neurological exam reveals contralateral hemiparesis in 60% of patients and ipsilateral pupillary dilation if uncal herniation develops. In elderly, presentation may be delayed by 24\u201372 hours due to brain atrophy providing extra space. Pediatric cases show irritability and bulging fontanelle. Gender differences are minimal, although males represent 65% of trauma-related hematomas. Associated systemic findings include hypotension in 40% and coagulopathy in 25%. Severity is graded by GCS and midline shift measures: small (<5 mm), moderate (5\u201310 mm), large (>10 mm). Red flags include rapid neurological decline, fixed dilated pupil, and Cushing triad (bradycardia, hypertension, irregular respiration). Without intervention, natural history leads to progressive cerebral edema, raised intracranial pressure, and death in up to 90% of cases with large collections.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Perform noncontrast head CT within 30 minutes of arrival. Sensitivity for acute subdural hematoma is 95% and specificity 97%. Identify crescent-shaped hyperdensity along convexity crossing suture lines; midline shift quantification guides urgency. Step 2: Obtain CT angiography if vascular injury suspected; yields 86% sensitivity for bridging vein pseudoaneurysm. Step 3: Order MRI with T2*-GRE or SWI sequences at 24\u201348 hours for subacute or chronic collections; gradient echo detects hemosiderin. Step 4: Evaluate coagulation panel: PT 11\u201315 seconds, aPTT 25\u201335 seconds, platelet count 150\u2013400 \u00d7 10\u00b3/\u00b5L. Step 5: If infection or neoplasm suspected, perform lumbar puncture only after imaging to avoid herniation; normal opening pressure 10\u201318 cm H\u2082O, protein 15\u201345 mg/dL. Step 6: EEG if seizures suspected, showing focal slowing or epileptiform discharges in 30% of acute cases. Differential includes epidural hematoma (lens-shaped, does not cross sutures), subarachnoid hemorrhage (cisternal blood), intracerebral hematoma (parenchymal), and hygroma (hypodense).","management_principles":"First-line management involves urgent surgical evacuation for hematomas >10 mm thickness or midline shift >5 mm, irrespective of GCS. Burr hole trephination under local anesthesia can remove 30\u201350 mL in unstable patients. Craniotomy with dural opening allows direct clot removal; typical procedure reduces intracranial pressure by 60%. Medical management includes hyperosmolar therapy: 3% hypertonic saline at 4 mL/kg bolus over 20 minutes (max 30 mL) and mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV over 20 minutes. Maintain mean arterial pressure 80\u2013100 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure 60\u201370 mm Hg. Prophylactic phenytoin loading 20 mg/kg IV then 5 mg/kg/day reduces early seizure risk by 50%. Second-line options include decompressive craniectomy when midline shift persists. Avoid anticoagulants and reverse coagulopathy with fresh frozen plasma (15 mL/kg) and vitamin K (10 mg IV). Interactions: mannitol may potentiate diuretics; contraindicated in severe renal failure (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2). In pregnancy, hypertonic saline is preferred over mannitol due to fetal osmolar tolerance.","follow_up_guidelines":"After surgical evacuation, schedule neurosurgical follow-up at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months post-discharge. Clinical monitoring includes GCS score, motor strength assessment, and headache diary. Repeat noncontrast CT at 24\u201348 hours to confirm hematoma resolution and again at 6 weeks in chronic cases. Monitor sodium levels daily, targeting 135\u2013145 mmol/L. Long-term complications include hydrocephalus (incidence 10%), seizures (30%), and cognitive impairment (25%). One-year mortality is 20% and five-year survival 65%. Rehabilitation needs vary: physical therapy for 3\u20136 months, occupational therapy for fine motor skills, and speech therapy if aphasia was present. Patient education should emphasize head injury prevention, fall-proofing environments, and gradual return-to-work protocols after 3 months. Driving is restricted for at least 6 months or until neurocognitive functions fully recover.

Crescentic hyperdensity crossing suture lines on CT is pathognomonic for subdural hematoma. 2. Unlike epidural bleeds, subdural collections do not respect dural reflections such as the falx. 3. Bridging vein tears account for over 70% of acute subdural bleeds in trauma. 4. GCS \u22648 with midline shift >5 mm mandates emergent surgical evacuation. 5. Hypertonic saline bolus (4 mL/kg of 3%) rapidly lowers intracranial pressure by 15\u201320%. 6. In elderly with brain atrophy, chronic subdural presentations may be delayed by days. 7. Never perform lumbar puncture before imaging in suspected intracranial hemorrhage. 8. Mnemonic \u201cCRESCENT\u201d helps recall key CT findings: Convex, Realigns suture, Extra-axial, Shifts midline, Can be bilateral, Edges are concave, No skull fracture, Thickness variable. 9. Recent 2020 Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines emphasize early CT within one hour for suspected head injury. 10. Cost-effectiveness studies favor burr hole drainage in unstable, comorbid patients to reduce OR time.","references":"1. Bullock MR, Chesnut R, Ghajar J, et al. Neurosurgery. 2006;58:S2\u2013S34.
