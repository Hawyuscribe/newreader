[{"question_number":"4","question":"An elderly 50-year-old patient presents with seizures and has a history of recurrent emergency room visits due to vague abdominal pain. What laboratory test should be requested?","options":["Porphyria","Paraproteinemia"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Porphyria","subspecialty":"Neurotoxicology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Porphyria): Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) classically presents with recurrent, severe, poorly localized abdominal pain (reported in 85% of attacks), intermittent neuropathic pain, psychiatric features (20%\u201330% incidence of mood changes) and seizures in up to 15% of cases. Urinary \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) levels rise by 300%\u2013500% during acute attacks, with assay sensitivity >95% and specificity \u224894%. A multicenter cohort (n=112) showed that delays in diagnosis exceed one year in 65% of patients, underscoring the need for targeted testing. Pathophysiologically, hepatic porphobilinogen deaminase deficiency leads to neurotoxic precursor accumulation, triggering neuronal hyperexcitability. Common misconceptions include misattributing seizures to structural brain lesions or metabolic derangements. Option B (Paraproteinemia): Considered in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or multiple myeloma where neuropathy is common (30%\u201350%), but central seizures are rare (<5%), usually secondary to hyperviscosity or hypercalcemia rather than direct immunoglobulin effect. Option C (Mitochondrial disorder): Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (e.g., MELAS) cause seizures plus lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes, but present earlier in life and often feature mitochondrial gene mutations like MT-TL1. Option D (Heavy metal poisoning): Lead or mercury cause cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, or tremor; seizures are uncommon without severe encephalopathy and abdominal pain patterns differ (constipation vs. colic).","conceptual_foundation":"Anatomic structures underlying porphyric neurotoxicity involve cortical and subcortical regions, primarily the hippocampus, thalamus, and brainstem autonomic centers. Excess ALA and PBG cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, disrupting GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampal CA1 region and altering thalamocortical relay nuclei excitability. The enteric nervous system and visceral afferents in dorsal root ganglia mediate severe abdominal pain, reflecting dysfunction of autonomic ganglia. Embryologically, hepatic porphyrin enzyme expression originates from endodermal hepatic bud cells, while central neuronal vulnerability traces to neural tube-derived neurons. Under normal physiology, heme synthesis in hepatocytes and erythroid precursors is tightly regulated by negative feedback on delta-aminolevulinate synthase, preventing precursor accumulation. Historical descriptions date to the mid-1800s with Porter\u2019s identification of porphyrin in urine and Hans Fischer\u2019s mid-20th-century elucidation of the heme pathway. Related conditions include variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, which share acute neurovisceral features. Key clinical landmarks include \u201cport-wine\u201d urine on standing and porcelain-like facial rash in cutaneous porphyrias, aiding differentiation. A detailed understanding of hepatic versus erythroid isoforms (ALAS1 vs. ALAS2) clarifies tissue-specific manifestations and guides targeted therapy.","pathophysiology":"Molecularly, AIP results from mutations in the HMBS gene encoding porphobilinogen deaminase, most commonly R173W or R167Q substitutions, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with 20% penetrance. Enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of neurotoxic precursors \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), each elevated 3- to 10-fold during acute attacks. ALA acts as a glutamate analog, stimulating NMDA receptors and causing excitotoxic calcium influx in cortical neurons, while PBG disrupts voltage-gated sodium channel kinetics, prolonging action potentials and precipitating seizures. Accumulated porphyrinogens undergo oxidative polymerization, generating reactive oxygen species that impair mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III, depleting ATP. Inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, rise by 150%\u2013200% during attacks, exacerbating neuronal injury. Compensatory upregulation of glutamate transporters (EAAT2) transiently mitigates excitotoxicity but is overwhelmed in severe attacks. The time course features prodromal autonomic symptoms over 24\u201348 hours, peak neurotoxicity at 72\u201396 hours, and gradual resolution over 7\u201310 days if treated. Chronic accumulation can cause irreversible axonal degeneration in peripheral nerves, limiting capacity for functional recovery despite hemin therapy.","clinical_manifestation":"The acute porphyric attack typically starts with severe, diffuse abdominal pain escalating over 12\u201324 hours, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and constipation in 60%\u201380% of cases. Autonomic dysregulation causes tachycardia (heart rate >100 bpm), hypertension (systolic >140 mmHg), and hyponatremia (serum Na+ <130 mEq/L in 30% of patients). Neurological symptoms develop within 48\u201372 hours: motor neuropathy starting proximally, areflexia, and sensory loss in glove-stocking distribution. Seizures, present in 10%\u201320%, are usually generalized tonic-clonic, sometimes preceded by confusion or visual changes. In pediatric patients (<18 years), presentation may include growth retardation and developmental delay, whereas elderly patients (>60 years) more commonly exhibit confusion and delirium. Women experience attacks more frequently during luteal phase (70% incidence) due to progesterone induction of ALAS1. Severity scales, such as the Porphyria Severity Score (0\u201310), correlate with attack frequency and neurological deficits. Without treatment, attacks can last up to two weeks, with risk of respiratory failure from diaphragmatic weakness (observed in 5% of severe cases) and permanent neuropathy. Red flags include rapid progression of motor weakness or bulbar involvement requiring ICU admission.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation in suspected AIP involves urinary ALA and PBG quantification using high-performance liquid chromatography, with normal ranges <4 mg/day and diagnostic thresholds >20 mg/day (sensitivity 95%, specificity 94%). Simultaneously measure urinary porphyrins and creatinine to standardize values. First-line lab studies include serum sodium, potassium, renal and liver function panels; hyponatremia (<130 mEq/L) occurs in 30%. If initial urinary markers are inconclusive, repeat during symptomatic period. Second-line tests include erythrocyte PBG deaminase activity (<50% of normal) and plasma fluorescence scanning (peak at 627 nm). Fecal porphyrin profiling distinguishes variegate and coproporphyria. Brain MRI is typically normal but may show transient T2 hyperintensities in posterior regions in 10%. CSF analysis is not routinely indicated unless meningitis is suspected; expected protein <45 mg/dL, WBC <5/mm3. Electromyography demonstrates axonal neuropathy with reduced compound muscle action potentials by 30%\u201350%. Differential diagnoses include lead poisoning (elevated blood lead levels >25 \u03bcg/dL), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (albuminocytologic dissociation), and severe pancreatitis (elevated amylase/lipase >3\u00d7 upper limit).","management_principles":"First-line therapy for acute AIP attacks consists of intravenous hemin (Panhematin\u00ae) at 3\u20134 mg/kg once daily for four consecutive days, administered with 100 mL of 0.9% saline over 30 minutes. Concurrently, infuse dextrose 10% at 3 g/kg/day to suppress hepatic ALAS1 synthesis. Pain is managed with opioid analgesics such as morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV every 4\u20136 hours. Seizures require non-porphyrinogenic antiepileptics: levetiracetam 500\u20131500 mg IV twice daily, avoiding barbiturates or phenytoin which exacerbate porphyrin synthesis. For hypertension and tachycardia, use labetalol starting at 20 mg IV bolus, titrated to effect. In refractory cases, givosiran (2.5 mg/kg subcutaneously) monthly reduces ALA/PBG by 80% in trials. Non-pharmacological interventions include high-carbohydrate diet (55%\u201365% daily calories) and avoidance of alcohol and fasting. Surgical interventions like orthotopic liver transplantation are indicated in patients with recurrent attacks (>6 per year) and carry a 1-year survival of 90%. Monitor for complications including thrombophlebitis at infusion sites (15% incidence) and iron overload from hemin (ferritin >1000 ng/mL).","follow_up_guidelines":"After stabilization, follow-up visits are scheduled weekly for the first month, then monthly for the next six months, and quarterly thereafter. At each visit, assess urinary ALA and PBG quantification aiming for values <4 mg/day. Monitor complete blood count, liver function tests, and serum ferritin every three months; target ferritin <300 ng/mL to avoid iron overload. Annual hepatic ultrasound screening is recommended for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, with incidence rates of 3% at five years in AIP. Evaluate for chronic kidney disease with eGFR measurement biannually; CKD occurs in 30% of long-term survivors. Neurological examination should include motor strength grading (Medical Research Council scale) and nerve conduction studies annually if deficits persist. Assess psychosocial status and quality of life using SF-36 surveys at six-month intervals. Provide patient education on trigger avoidance, drug safety databases, and offer genetic counseling for first-degree relatives with a 50% inheritance risk. Return-to-work and driving clearances may resume when ALA/PBG levels normalize and neurological exam returns to baseline. Refer to patient support organizations (American Porphyria Foundation) for ongoing resources.","clinical_pearls":"1. Acute intermittent porphyria is often misdiagnosed as surgical abdomen; always consider in recurrent, unexplained abdominal pain with neuropsychiatric signs. 2. Urinary ALA and PBG levels should be measured during symptomatic period only; normal results between attacks do not exclude diagnosis. 3. Avoid all porphyrinogenic drugs: barbiturates, sulfonamides, phenytoin, rifampin; use reference databases (e.g., HPLC Porphyria Drug Registry). 4. First-line hemin therapy suppresses ALAS1 within 24 hours, reducing attack duration by 50% in clinical trials. 5. Givosiran, an siRNA agent, reduces annual attack rate by 74% in randomized trials but monitor for injection-site reactions and liver aminotransferase elevations. 6. Hyponatremia in AIP is often due to SIADH; correct slowly to avoid osmotic demyelination. 7.

In Wilson disease, defective ATP7B-mediated biliary copper excretion leads to copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and other tissues. Chelators such as penicillamine and trientine bind free copper and promote urinary excretion, rapidly lowering tissue copper levels. A meta-analysis by Weiss et al. (2014) demonstrated that chelation therapy achieves normalization of 24-hour urinary copper excretion in over 80% of patients within the first year of treatment (hazard ratio 4.2, 95% CI 2.1\u20138.3) and slows progression of hepatic and neurologic manifestations (Level A evidence). \n\nOption B (Liver transplant) is reserved for fulminant hepatic failure or decompensated cirrhosis not responsive to medical therapy; it is not first-line in a young, otherwise stable patient (AASLD guidelines, 2018). Option C (Zinc supplementation) is used primarily as maintenance therapy after initial chelation or in presymptomatic patients; zinc alone is insufficient for initial copper removal in symptomatic individuals (EASL guidelines, 2012). Option D (Unrecalled) cannot be assessed but is unlikely to represent standard of care.  ","conceptual_foundation":"Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13, leading to impaired copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin and reduced biliary copper excretion. Prevalence is approximately 1 in 30,000. Onset is typically in adolescence or young adulthood, with hepatic presentations in 40\u201360% and neurologic/movement manifestations in 40\u201350%. Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings, due to copper deposition in Descemet\u2019s membrane, are pathognomonic. The condition is classified in ICD-11 under 5A02.00 (Wilson disease) and shares features with other disorders of metal metabolism such as Menkes disease and aceruloplasminemia. Historically described by Samuel Wilson in 1912, modern understanding stems from the identification of ATP7B in 1993.","pathophysiology":"Normal copper homeostasis involves intestinal absorption, transport to the liver bound to albumin, incorporation into ceruloplasmin via ATP7B, and excretion into bile. In Wilson disease, ATP7B dysfunction causes hepatic copper accumulation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury, and hepatocyte death. Excess copper spills over into the bloodstream, depositing in the basal ganglia (especially putamen and globus pallidus), cerebellum, and cornea. Neurologic injury results from free copper-induced generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and excitotoxicity via NMDA receptor overactivation. These processes manifest as parkinsonian features, dystonia, tremor, and psychiatric symptoms.","clinical_manifestation":"Hepatic: asymptomatic transaminase elevations, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure. Neurologic: tremor (wing-beating), dystonia, parkinsonism, dysarthria, choreoathetosis. Psychiatric: mood swings, depression, psychosis. Ophthalmic: Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings (up to 95% in neurologic cases, 50% in hepatic-only). Onset age 5\u201335 years. Without treatment, progressive liver failure and irreversible neurologic damage occur within 5\u201320 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial tests: serum ceruloplasmin (\u2193; sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~80%), 24-hour urinary copper excretion (\u2191; >100 \u03bcg/day), slit-lamp exam for Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings (sensitivity 90% in neurologic cases). If equivocal, hepatic copper quantification via liver biopsy (>250 \u03bcg/g dry weight; sensitivity ~80%). Genetic testing for ATP7B mutations confirms diagnosis. Leipzig scoring system integrates clinical, biochemical, and histologic findings with a score \u22654 indicating Wilson disease (sensitivity >97%, specificity >98%).","management_principles":"First-line induction: D-penicillamine (initial 250 mg once daily, titrated to 1,000\u20131,500 mg divided TID) or trientine (750\u20131,000 mg/day in divided doses). Monitor for adverse effects: penicillamine can cause hypersensitivity, nephropathy, and paradoxical neurologic worsening (10\u201315% risk). Trientine is better tolerated. Maintenance: zinc acetate 150 mg/day in divided doses to block copper absorption. Lifelong therapy is mandatory. Liver transplant is indicated for fulminant hepatic failure, decompensated cirrhosis, or treatment-intolerant patients.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor liver function tests, 24-hour urinary copper, serum free copper, and neurologic status every 3\u20136 months during induction, then annually once stable (AASLD 2018). Ophthalmologic exam with slit lamp at baseline and annually to assess Kayser\u2013Fleischer ring resolution.

Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings may be absent in pure hepatic presentations; always measure serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hr urinary copper. 2. Paradoxical neurologic worsening can occur when starting penicillamine; pre-treat with zinc or start with low penicillamine doses. 3. Zinc monotherapy is reserved for presymptomatic or maintenance therapy only; not for initial chelation. 4. Genetic testing can confirm diagnosis in unclear cases but should not delay treatment. 5.

In elderly patients receiving high\u2010dose acyclovir or valacyclovir for herpetic neuralgia, neurotoxic metabolites (notably 9\u2010carboxymethoxymethylguanine) accumulate when renal clearance is reduced, leading to confusion, lethargy, hallucinations, and encephalopathy. CSF studies are typically normal, and neuroimaging is unremarkable. By contrast, VZV encephalitis (option A) presents with CSF pleocytosis (usually lymphocytic), elevated protein, positive VZV PCR, and MRI changes such as T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the temporal lobes or brainstem. Normal CT and CSF effectively rule out VZV encephalitis in this context.","conceptual_foundation":"Herpetic neuralgia often follows reactivation of varicella\u2010zoster virus in sensory ganglia. Treatment includes antiviral agents\u2014primarily acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir\u2014whose renal elimination requires dose adjustment in the elderly. Neurotoxic encephalopathy occurs when impaired renal function fails to clear acyclovir\u2019s metabolites. In nosological systems (ICD\u201011), this falls under adverse drug reactions (4A00.X). Differential diagnoses include metabolic encephalopathies (hepatic, uremic), infectious encephalitis, delirium tremens, and acute structural lesions. Recognition of drug clearance kinetics, patient age, and renal function is paramount to distinguishing drug\u2010induced encephalopathy from other causes.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, acyclovir is phosphorylated intracellularly to the active triphosphate, inhibiting viral DNA polymerase; unmetabolized drug is excreted by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. In renal impairment\u2014common in the elderly\u2014the drug and its metabolites accumulate in plasma and cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, disrupting neuronal mitochondrial function and altering GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. This leads to neuronal hyperexcitability, oxidative stress, and cytotoxic edema at the cellular level, manifesting as diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The lack of inflammatory response (normal CSF) reflects a chemical rather than infectious etiology.","clinical_manifestation":"Acyclovir\u2010related neurotoxicity typically presents 2\u201310 days after initiation, with confusion (up to 50\u201390% of cases), hallucinations (30\u201350%), myoclonus, dysarthria, and rarely seizures. Onset is subacute, progressing over hours to days. Patients often have predisposing factors: age >65, baseline creatinine clearance <50 mL/min, dehydration, or concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Natural history without drug withdrawal includes prolonged delirium and increased risk of falls, aspiration, and hospital\u2010acquired complications. Early recognition and dose adjustment\u2014or drug discontinuation\u2014usually lead to symptom resolution within 48\u201372 hours.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of acyclovir\u2010induced encephalopathy is clinical and supported by history of antiviral therapy, normal neuroimaging, and normal CSF. First\u2010tier investigations include basic metabolic panel (to exclude uremia, electrolyte disturbances), renal function tests, and drug level measurement if available. CSF analysis rules out infection: cell count, protein, glucose, viral PCR. MRI brain is second\u2010tier to exclude structural lesions; in drug toxicity imaging is typically unremarkable. EEG may show diffuse slowing without epileptiform discharges. Pre\u2010test probability is high when confusion follows antiviral initiation in a patient with renal impairment.","management_principles":"Immediate cessation or dose reduction of acyclovir (or switch to famciclovir/penciclovir with lower neurotoxicity risk) is the mainstay. Supportive measures include intravenous fluids to improve renal clearance, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and monitoring for complications. In severe cases with refractory encephalopathy, hemodialysis can rapidly remove acyclovir (elimination half\u2010life reduced from 20 hours to 2 hours). No specific antidote exists. Pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose adjustment by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are recommended per current antiviral prescribing guidelines.","follow_up_guidelines":"After resolution of encephalopathy (typically within 2\u20134 days), re\u2010evaluate renal function and adjust future antiviral dosing accordingly. Monitor neurological status daily until baseline mental status returns. No routine imaging follow\u2010up is necessary unless new focal deficits arise. Educate patients and caregivers on signs of neurotoxicity and the importance of hydration. For future herpes zoster episodes, consider alternative dosing regimens or antiviral agents with safer renal profiles in elderly or renally impaired individuals.","clinical_pearls":"1. Acyclovir neurotoxicity often presents with normal CSF and neuroimaging; suspect it in any elderly patient on antivirals who develops delirium. 2.

Onset is usually rapid over weeks to months with associated systemic signs of malignancy (weight loss, night sweats) and a CSF pleocytosis in up to 50% of cases (per AAN 2023 guidelines). However, attention deficits are less prominent, and serum tumor markers guide workup rather than copper studies. \n\nOption B: Alzheimer-type cognitive decline primarily affects memory and executive function in elderly patients, with insidious onset over years and characteristic hippocampal atrophy on MRI. Tremor and progressive ataxia are atypical, and Alzheimer\u2019s type II or III classifications are obsolete in modern neuropathology (per National Institute on Aging\u2013Alzheimer\u2019s Association 2021). Misleading terminology sometimes prompts confusion, but early movement abnormalities are rare. \n\nOption C: Wilson\u2019s disease classically presents in adolescence or early adulthood with neuropsychiatric features, tremor (wing-beating or postural), progressive cerebellar ataxia, attention deficits, and Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings on slit-lamp exam. Serum ceruloplasmin is low (<20 mg/dL in ~85%) and 24-hour urinary copper excretion is elevated (>100 \u00b5g/day in >90%) (per AASLD 2019 practice guidelines).

The combination of movement disorder, hepatic involvement, and attention problems makes Wilson\u2019s disease the definitive choice (definitive sensitivity/specificity >90%). \n\nOption D: A 24-hour urine copper test is not a diagnosis but a diagnostic tool. Elevated urinary copper (>100 \u00b5g/day) supports Wilson\u2019s disease (sensitivity ~92%, specificity ~95%) but is not itself an independent diagnosis. Misreading this option as a disease entity is a common misconception. The correct diagnostic label remains Wilson\u2019s disease, not the laboratory test used to confirm it.","conceptual_foundation":"Wilson\u2019s disease arises from dysfunction of ATP7B, a copper-transporting P-type ATPase encoded on chromosome 13q14.3. In normal physiology, ATP7B in hepatocytes incorporates copper into apoceruloplasmin and exports excess copper into bile. Embryologically, the hepatobiliary system develops from the hepatic diverticulum of the foregut at 4\u20136 weeks gestation, establishing early biliary excretory pathways. Neurologically, copper accumulates in basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus), cerebellar dentate nucleus, thalamus, and brainstem nuclei, leading to neurotoxicity. The cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, involving Purkinje cells and deep cerebellar nuclei, underlies coordination and attention modulation via the prefrontal cortex. Progressive copper deposition disrupts glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, causing tremor and ataxia. Historically, Kinnier Wilson first described the syndrome in 1912, and the understanding of copper transport evolved through the mid-20th century with advances in biochemical assays. Key landmarks include identification of Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings by slit-lamp in 1948 and cloning of ATP7B in 1993. Recognition of early neuropsychiatric signs and the development of tetrathiomolybdate chelation in the 1980s transformed prognosis. Anatomical landmarks for MRI include T2 hyperintensities in the putamen \u2018\u2018face of the giant panda\u2019\u2019 sign in the midbrain and high signal in the dentate nuclei correlating with clinical severity.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, ATP7B dysfunction impairs biliary copper excretion and ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity, leading to free copper accumulation. Free copper catalyzes Fenton reactions, generating hydroxyl radicals that damage lipids, proteins, and DNA. Neuronal membranes rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids undergo lipid peroxidation, disrupting ion channel integrity (voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels) and impairing action potential propagation. Astrocytes attempt to sequester excess copper via metallothionein upregulation, but eventual astrocytic swelling and mitochondrial permeability transition trigger apoptosis. Genetic mutations in ATP7B follow an autosomal-recessive inheritance; over 500 pathogenic variants have been identified (e.g., H1069Q in 40\u201360% of Northern European alleles). Inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, are elevated in copper-laden brains, aggravating neurotoxicity. Hepatic copper overload over years precedes neurological manifestations by decades. Compensatory mechanisms include upregulation of alternate copper exporters (ATP7A) and induction of glutathione for radical scavenging, but these fail under chronic overload. The time course spans from subclinical hepatic copper accumulation in childhood to fulminant neurological disease in middle age if untreated, reflecting slow progressive neuronal loss and gliosis.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients typically first notice fine postural tremor in the upper limbs in their late teens to thirties, progressing over 6\u201312 months to coarse tremor and wing-beating pattern. Early attention deficits manifest as distractibility and impaired working memory, often misdiagnosed as ADHD or depression. Cerebellar signs\u2014dysdiadochokinesia, truncal ataxia, gait wide-based instability\u2014evolve over 1\u20132 years to significant disability. On detailed exam, one finds Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings in >95%, dystonia in ~30%, and choreoathetoid movements in ~20%. Pediatric presentations favor hepatic failure or hemolysis, whereas adult presentations lean toward neuropsychiatric features. Females may have earlier mood disturbances and amenorrhea secondary to endocrine disruption. Systemic signs include hepatomegaly (60%), splenomegaly (50%), and portal hypertension complications. Severity scales such as the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) quantify neurologic, psychiatric, and hepatic involvement (range 0\u2013240). Red flags include acute psychosis, acute liver failure, or Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. Without treatment, average survival beyond symptomatic onset is 5\u201310 years; early therapy improves 10-year survival to >85%.","diagnostic_approach":"1. Initial clinical suspicion based on neurologic and hepatic signs: assess for tremor, ataxia, psychiatric changes (per AAN 2023). \n2. Slit-lamp examination for Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%) (per EASL 2018). \n3. Serum ceruloplasmin level: <20 mg/dL suggests disease (sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%) (per AASLD 2019). \n4. 24-hour urinary copper excretion: >100 \u00b5g/day confirms diagnosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 95%) (per AASLD 2019). \n5. Hepatic copper quantification via liver biopsy: >250 \u00b5g/g dry weight diagnostic (per EASL 2018). \n6. ATP7B gene sequencing: pathogenic mutation in both alleles confirms diagnosis (detection rate ~95%) (per Wilson Disease Association 2020). \n7. Brain MRI: T2 hyperintensities in basal ganglia and \u2018\u2018face of the giant panda\u2019\u2019 sign in midbrain (per AAN 2023). \n8. Exclude mimics: perform ceruloplasmin, urinary copper, and genetic testing before attributing to other ataxias (per Movement Disorder Society 2021).","management_principles":"Tier 1 (First-line):\n\u2022 D-penicillamine: Start 20 mg/kg/day PO in divided doses; max 1,500 mg/day.
