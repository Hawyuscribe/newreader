Caf\u00e9 au lait spots appear as well-defined hyperpigmented macules. Over 90% of NF1 patients have \u22656 caf\u00e9 au lait spots by age 8 (Ferner & Gutmann, 2019).","conceptual_foundation":"NF1 is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome (ICD-11: 8A60.0) caused by NF1 gene mutation encoding neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase activating protein. Loss of function leads to RAS/MAPK pathway overactivity, resulting in melanocyte proliferation (caf\u00e9 au lait) and neurofibroma formation.","pathophysiology":"Neurofibromin deficiency causes unchecked RAS signaling, increasing melanocyte activity in the epidermis and Schwann cell proliferation in peripheral nerves. Caf\u00e9 au lait spots reflect localized melanocyte hyperplasia.","clinical_manifestation":"\u22656 caf\u00e9 au lait macules >5 mm (prepubertal) or >15 mm (postpubertal) is a diagnostic NIH criterion (1987). They may be present at birth or appear by age 2. Axillary/inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, optic pathway gliomas are additional features.","diagnostic_approach":"NIH criteria require 2 of 7 features: caf\u00e9 au lait spots, neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, freckling, optic glioma, bone dysplasia, or a first-degree relative with NF1.

Symptomatic neurofibromas may be surgically excised; MEK inhibitors (selumetinib) reduce plexiform neurofibroma volume by ~60% at 1 year (Dombi et al., 2016).","follow_up_guidelines":"Annual multidisciplinary follow-up with neurology, oncology, orthopedics, ophthalmology, and dermatology. MRI screening reserved for symptomatic lesions. Monitor growth and developmental milestones.","clinical_pearls":"1. 'Six and fifteen' rule for caf\u00e9 au lait size; 2. Axillary freckling appears by age 5; 3. Lisch nodules detected by slit lamp; 4. Plexiform neurofibromas carry MPNST risk; 5.

Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) presents in children 3\u20137 years old with acquired aphasia or auditory verbal agnosia and epilepsy, most often with continuous spike\u2013wave discharges during sleep. Multiple series (e.g., Hrachovy et al. 2012) report that LKS children have normal development until language regression, with EEG showing focal or generalized spikes maximal over temporal regions. Option B, Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome, features multiple seizure types (tonic, atonic) with slow 1\u20132 Hz spike\u2013wave discharges and intellectual disability but not isolated auditory agnosia. Option C, Ohtahara syndrome, onsets in infancy with tonic spasms and suppression-burst pattern on EEG. Option D, West syndrome, presents with infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and developmental arrest in infants 4\u20138 months old, without acquired auditory agnosia.","conceptual_foundation":"Landau-Kleffner syndrome is classified under epileptic encephalopathies in the ILAE 2017 classification. It is distinguished by regression of receptive and expressive language. Differential diagnoses include autism spectrum disorders, specific language impairment, and other epileptic encephalopathies (e.g., CSWS). Historically first described in 1957, LKS is now recognized as a focal epilepsy with secondary language network disruption. Language processing involves Wernicke\u2019s area in the superior temporal gyrus; dysfunction leads to auditory agnosia. Developmentally, these functions mature in early childhood, overlapping with the age of onset in LKS. Genetic factors are not well established, though de novo SCN1A variants have been reported in some cases.","pathophysiology":"Normal auditory language processing depends on intact primary auditory cortex (Heschl\u2019s gyrus), Wernicke\u2019s area, and interhemispheric transfer via the corpus callosum. In LKS, epileptiform discharges during sleep disrupt maturation and function of these networks. Microglial activation and altered GABAergic inhibition have been proposed. Continuous spike\u2013wave during sleep (CSWS) leads to maladaptive synaptic plasticity and language network disconnection. Over time, repeated waves impair receptive language, leading to auditory verbal agnosia. This contrasts with LGS, where widespread cortical hyperexcitability leads to multiple seizure types without isolated language regression.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with LKS typically present between ages 3\u20137 with acute or gradual loss of language (both comprehension and expression) and behavioral changes (hyperactivity, attention deficits). Seizures occur in 70\u201390% of cases and may be focal motor or generalized. EEG often shows focal temporal spikes or generalized discharges, exacerbated in slow-wave sleep. Naturally, untreated language deficits may become permanent. In contrast to CSWS without language regression, LKS has prominent verbal agnosia.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on clinical history of language regression, neuropsychological testing confirming auditory agnosia, and EEG demonstrating CSWS or frequent temporal spikes, especially during non-REM sleep. MRI is usually normal but may be performed to rule out structural lesions. Video EEG monitoring during sleep can quantify spike\u2013wave index. Genetic testing is not routinely diagnostic but may be considered for SCN1A or GRIN2A variants. Differential includes autism spectrum disorder and Landau-Kleffner plus variants.","management_principles":"First-line treatment involves high-dose benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam at night) to suppress CSWS, often combined with corticosteroids (prednisone 2 mg/kg/day tapered over months) based on Class III evidence. Valproate and sulthiame are also used to reduce interictal spikes. In refractory cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or ketogenic diet have been tried with variable benefit. Speech therapy is critical. Early aggressive treatment is associated with better language outcomes.","follow_up_guidelines":"Children should have serial EEGs every 3\u20136 months to monitor spike index, neuropsychological testing every 6\u201312 months to assess language recovery, and regular speech therapy sessions. Corticosteroid side effects (weight gain, hypertension, behavioral changes) require monitoring. If EEG normalizes and language stabilizes, medications may be tapered after 1\u20132 years.","clinical_pearls":"1. LKS presents after 3 years with acquired auditory agnosia and seizures; key EEG finding is CSWS. 2. Early corticosteroid therapy improves language outcomes; delay predicts permanent deficits. 3. MRI is typically normal\u2014rule out structural lesions causing acquired aphasia. 4. Differentiate from autism by preserved social interaction until language regression. 5. Spike\u2013wave index >85% during sleep correlates with severity of language regression.","references":"1. Hrachovy RA, Frost JD Jr, Kellaway P. Landau-Kleffner syndrome: Epileptic aphasia.
