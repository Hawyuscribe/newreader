In children with sickle cell disease (SCD), elevated middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow velocities (> 200 cm/s) on transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening correlate with a high stroke risk (absolute risk \u2248 10% per year; Adams et al., 1992). Regular TCD monitoring and chronic transfusion reduce stroke risk by 92% (STOP trial). Option A (Hb electrophoresis) is necessary for initial diagnosis and monitoring hemoglobin variants but does not directly quantify cerebral blood flow or stroke risk.","conceptual_foundation":"Sickle cell disease (ICD-11 code 3A80) is a hemoglobinopathy caused by a \u03b2-globin gene mutation (Glu6Val). Cerebral vasculopathy in SCD includes large\u2010vessel stenosis and moyamoya. TCD measures time\u2010averaged mean velocities as a surrogate for stenosis severity. Baseline risk stratification is based on TCD velocities: normal (< 170 cm/s), conditional (170\u2013199 cm/s), and abnormal (\u2265 200 cm/s).","pathophysiology":"Sickling of red cells leads to endothelial damage, intimal hyperplasia, and progressive large-vessel stenosis, especially in the MCA and internal carotid arteries. Stenosis increases flow velocity (V = Q/A), which TCD detects. High velocities indicate reduced lumen and high stroke risk due to decreased distal perfusion and increased shear stress.","clinical_manifestation":"Children with SCD and cerebral vasculopathy may present with overt stroke (focal deficits), transient ischemic attacks, or silent infarcts (cognitive impairment). Timely TCD screening identifies high\u2010risk patients before clinical stroke occurs.","diagnostic_approach":"Annual TCD screening is recommended from ages 2 to 16 years in SCD (AHA guidelines, Class I). Baseline Hb electrophoresis is needed for diagnosis but not for stroke risk stratification. Abnormal TCD prompts MRI/MRA evaluation for vasculopathy.","management_principles":"For abnormal TCD (> 200 cm/s), chronic transfusion therapy to maintain HbS < 30% reduces stroke risk by 92% (STOP trial; NNT = 2). Hydroxyurea is an alternative when transfusion is not feasible. Iron chelation is required long\u2010term for transfusion recipients.","follow_up_guidelines":"Repeat TCD every 3\u20136 months in conditional velocities (170\u2013199 cm/s) and every 3 months in abnormal velocities; monitor iron overload with ferritin and T2* MRI; transition to hydroxyurea may be considered after 1\u20132 years of transfusion if vasculopathy stabilized.","clinical_pearls":"1. TCD velocity \u2265 200 cm/s predicts 10% annual stroke risk in SCD. 2. STOP trial: transfusion reduces stroke risk by 92%. 3. Hb electrophoresis is diagnostic but not prognostic for stroke. 4. MRI/MRA follow abnormal TCD to define vasculopathy. 5. Hydroxyurea is an alternative for chronic transfusion.","references":"1. Adams RJ et al.

Leigh syndrome is a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy presenting in infancy or early childhood with developmental delay and symmetrical high\u2010signal lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem on T2\u2010weighted MRI. No other options were provided.","conceptual_foundation":"Leigh syndrome is classified under mitochondrial disorders in ICD-11. It results from defects in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, most commonly complex I or complex V (ATP synthase). Differential diagnoses include Wilson disease, glutaric aciduria type I, and other metabolic or neurodegenerative disorders. Embryologically, the basal ganglia derive from the telencephalon; mitochondrial dysfunction in neuronal cells leads to energy failure in high\u2010demand regions. Neurotransmitter disturbances include altered glutamate and GABA metabolism due to impaired ATP production.","pathophysiology":"Normal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation generates ATP through electron transport and proton gradient formation. In Leigh syndrome, mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA encoding respiratory chain subunits impair ATP synthesis, leading to neuronal energy failure, lactate accumulation, and selective vulnerability of basal ganglia and brainstem nuclei. Lesion evolution is subacute to chronic, with progressive demyelination and spongiform changes.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present in infancy or early childhood with psychomotor regression, hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, and failure to thrive. Ophthalmologic findings may include nystagmus or optic atrophy. Natural history without treatment is progressive neurologic decline and early mortality. Diagnostic criteria include clinical features plus MRI and biochemical or genetic confirmation.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Brain MRI showing symmetric T2 hyperintensities in basal ganglia/brainstem. Serum/CSF lactate elevation. Second\u2010tier: Enzymatic assays of mitochondrial complexes in muscle biopsy. Third\u2010tier: Genetic testing of mitochondrial and nuclear genes (e.g., SURF1, MT\u2010ATP6). Sensitivity of genetic panels ~80%, specificity ~99%.","management_principles":"No cure exists. Supportive care includes nutritional support, physiotherapy, and seizure management. Empiric mitochondrial cocktails (e.g., coenzyme Q10, thiamine, L\u2010carnitine) may be tried (Level C evidence). Avoid metabolic stressors. Genetic counseling is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Regular multidisciplinary follow\u2010up every 3\u20136 months with neurology, genetics, nutrition, and physical therapy. Monitor growth, developmental milestones, lactate levels, and organ function. Adjust supportive therapies as disease progresses.","clinical_pearls":"1. Leigh syndrome often shows elevated lactate in blood/CSF. 2. MRI is critical: symmetrical basal ganglia T2 hyperintensities. 3. Mitochondrial DNA and nuclear gene mutations both implicated. 4.

Caf\u00e9-au-lait macules are light-brown pigmented skin lesions, often on the neck, and a cardinal feature of NF1. NF1 is autosomal dominant, so a patient with ADHD whose mother has caf\u00e9-au-lait spots likely inherited NF1. NF1 is associated with learning disabilities and ADHD in ~60% of children (North et al., 2018). No other condition presents with both brown neck pigmentation and ADHD.","conceptual_foundation":"NF1 is one of the neurocutaneous syndromes (phakomatoses). In ICD-11, it is coded under congenital malformations of the nervous system. It arises from mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, encoding neurofibromin, a Ras-GAP. Caf\u00e9-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented macules, \u22656 spots >5 mm in children or >15 mm in adults, required for diagnosis. Differential includes Legius syndrome (SPRED1 mutation) and McCune\u2013Albright syndrome.","pathophysiology":"Neurofibromin normally downregulates Ras signaling. Loss of function leads to increased cell proliferation in melanocytes (caf\u00e9-au-lait macules), Schwann cells (neurofibromas), and astrocytes (optic gliomas). ADHD in NF1 is multifactorial: white matter microstructural abnormalities and cortical dysplasia affecting attention networks.","clinical_manifestation":"Children present with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (\u22656), freckling in axilla/inguinal regions, Lisch nodules on iris, neurofibromas, osseous lesions. ADHD and learning disabilities occur in 50\u201370%. Optic pathway gliomas occur in 15\u201320%.

MRI of brain/orbits if optic glioma suspected. Ophthalmologic exam for Lisch nodules. Genetic testing can confirm in atypical cases.","management_principles":"Multidisciplinary care: annual ophthalmology, neurologic, and dermatologic evaluations.
