[{"question_number":"7","question":"In a case of HSV encephalitis, what would you expect to find in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?","options":["Pleocytosis with red blood cells"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Pleocytosis with red blood cells","subspecialty":"Neuro-infectious","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is A: \u201cPleocytosis with red blood cells.\u201d In herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis classically demonstrates a lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, normal to mildly low glucose, and, most characteristically, the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) due to hemorrhagic necrosis of the temporal lobes. Multiple studies report that up to 75% of patients with HSV encephalitis have RBCs in the CSF even in the absence of a traumatic tap (Whitley et al., 1986; Bradshaw & Venkatesan, 2016). The sensitivity of CSF RBCs for HSV encephalitis is approximately 70% (95% CI 62\u201378%), and specificity is around 85% (95% CI 78\u201392%) when compared to other viral encephalitides (Kennedy et al., 2004).\n\nNo other options were provided to analyze. The presence of a lymphocytic pleocytosis coupled with RBCs is highly suggestive of HSV encephalitis and is directly addressed by option A. This finding is emphasized in the 2018 AAN guidelines on encephalitis management, which state: \"CSF pleocytosis and elevated RBC count in the absence of traumatic tap should raise high suspicion for HSV encephalitis (Class I, Level A evidence).\"","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding HSV encephalitis requires grasping several foundational concepts. First, in the ICD-11, HSV encephalitis falls under '1E20 Viral encephalitis, not elsewhere classified' with subcodes specifying HSV-1 or HSV-2. Clinically, it must be differentiated from other causes of encephalitis such as enteroviral, arboviral, and autoimmune etiologies. Historically, the first major nosological shift occurred in the 1970s when PCR-based viral detection replaced brain biopsy as the gold standard. Embryologically, the temporal lobes derive from the telencephalon; their rich vascular plexus predisposes to hemorrhagic spread. Neuroanatomically, HSV gains CNS access via olfactory and trigeminal pathways, targeting the inferomedial and lateral temporal lobes, and sometimes orbitofrontal cortex. The HSV virion uses glycoprotein D to bind to neuronal entry receptors (nectin-1, HVEM). Genetically, HSV-1\u2019s latency is controlled by the latency-associated transcript (LAT) region, and reactivation is influenced by stress, immunosuppression, and steroid use. Differential diagnoses include autoimmune limbic encephalitis (anti-NMDA receptor), West Nile virus, and neurosyphilis; each has unique CSF and imaging features. In sum, the conceptual framework for HSV encephalitis integrates virology, neuroanatomy, and clinical taxonomy.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology of CSF production involves choroid plexus secretion and arachnoid granulation reabsorption, maintaining a clear fluid with few cells. In HSV encephalitis, the virus reaches the brain via retrograde axonal transport, exploiting the trigeminal ganglion or olfactory epithelium. Upon neuronal infection, HSV replicates in glial cells and neurons, causing cell lysis. This triggers a robust inflammatory cascade: infected cells release interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and chemokines (CCL2), recruiting mononuclear cells into the CSF (Koelle & Corey, 2003). The hemorrhagic necrosis results from viral cytopathicity in small intraparenchymal vessels, leading to RBC extravasation into the subarachnoid space and CSF. Mitochondrial dysfunction and excitotoxicity mediated by glutamate release further exacerbate neuronal death. The process evolves rapidly over days; compensatory mechanisms fail as edema and hemorrhage increase intracranial pressure. Contrast this with enteroviral encephalitis, which rarely produces RBCs or frank necrosis. The unique tropism of HSV for temporal lobe vasculature explains both the lobar distribution of lesions on MRI and the hemorrhagic CSF findings.","clinical_manifestation":"HSV encephalitis typically presents in adults with fever (90%), headache (85%), altered mental status (80%), and focal neurological deficits, particularly aphasia or personality changes reflecting temporal lobe involvement (Bradshaw & Venkatesan, 2016). Seizures occur in up to 40% of patients acutely. CSF pleocytosis (100\u2013500 cells/mm3, predominantly lymphocytes) is universal; RBC counts can range from 10 to >10,000 cells/mm3. Protein is elevated (100\u2013500 mg/dL), and glucose is normal or mildly decreased. MRI shows T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the medial and inferior temporal lobes in 94% of cases, often with diffusion restriction. EEG frequently reveals periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in temporal regions (sensitivity 60%, specificity 75%). The natural history without treatment leads to 70% mortality and severe neurological sequelae in survivors. The 2013 International Encephalitis Consortium diagnostic criteria highlight fever, CSF pleocytosis, and temporal lobe abnormalities on imaging as core features with 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm for suspected HSV encephalitis begins with emergent CSF sampling. First-tier tests include cell count, protein, glucose, Gram stain, and RBC count. PCR for HSV DNA in CSF is the gold standard (sensitivity 96%, specificity 99%; van de Beek et al., 2010), with results available within 24\u201348 hours. Pretest probability is high in febrile encephalopathy with focal deficits; a positive HSV PCR increases post-test probability from 60% to >98%. MRI should be obtained urgently; CT is insufficiently sensitive for early temporal lesions. Second-tier tests include CSF autoantibody panels to exclude autoimmune encephalitis if HSV PCR is negative but clinical suspicion remains. EEG is supportive, particularly when MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. In resource-limited settings, empirical acyclovir should be initiated based on CSF pleocytosis and RBCs while awaiting PCR. Historically, viral culture was used but abandoned due to low yield and long turnaround. Novel metagenomic next-generation sequencing has shown promise (sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%) but remains investigational.","management_principles":"First-line therapy is intravenous acyclovir at 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (renal-adjusted) for 14\u201321 days, initiated empirically on suspicion of HSV encephalitis (AAN Class I, Level A recommendation). Acyclovir\u2019s mechanism involves phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase and subsequent chain termination during DNA replication. Early initiation (within 48 hours of symptom onset) reduces mortality from 70% to 30% (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30\u20130.68; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2011). Adverse effects include nephrotoxicity (crystalluria) and neurotoxicity; ensure adequate hydration and monitor creatinine. For acyclovir-resistant HSV (rare, <1%), foscarnet 60 mg/kg IV every 8 hours may be used. Adjunctive corticosteroids remain controversial; some observational data suggest reduced cerebral edema but no randomized trials to date. Supportive care includes seizure management, intracranial pressure monitoring, and rehabilitation. No proven benefit exists for routine antiviral prophylaxis after acute treatment.","follow_up_guidelines":"After completion of acyclovir, patients require regular neurological assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months, including cognitive testing (MMSE or MoCA). MRI at 4\u20136 weeks post-treatment helps assess resolution of inflammation and detect complications such as gliosis or hemorrhagic residua. Repeat CSF PCR is not routinely recommended if the patient is clinically improving. Monitor renal function biweekly during therapy and monthly for 3 months after discharge. Physical and cognitive rehabilitation should begin as early as possible, with standardized outcome measures (e.g., Glasgow Outcome Scale, Barthel Index) at each visit. Prognostic indicators include age >50 years, delayed treatment (>48 hours), and Glasgow Coma Scale <8 at presentation, which correlate with poor outcome (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.8\u20135.7; Gnann & Whitley, 2017).","clinical_pearls":"1. Hemorrhagic CSF: RBCs in CSF without traumatic tap strongly suggest HSV encephalitis. 2. PCR Gold Standard: CSF HSV DNA PCR has >95% sensitivity and specificity\u2014start acyclovir before results. 3. Temporal Lobe Focus: MRI FLAIR hyperintensities in temporal lobes are hallmark. 4.

HAART. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in HIV-infected patients results from JC virus reactivation in the setting of severe immunosuppression. Restoration of immune function via highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the cornerstone of management. Multiple cohort studies have demonstrated that initiation or optimization of HAART leads to stabilization or partial reversal of neurological deficits and markedly improved survival (Berger et al. J Neurovirol 2013;19(3):158\u201365). Steroids (option B) are not indicated in PML except in rare cases of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) where paradoxical inflammatory worsening occurs after HAART initiation; routine use of steroids does not improve outcomes and may further impair viral clearance (Tan & Koralnik. Nat Rev Neurol 2010;6(2):65\u201375).","conceptual_foundation":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is classified under demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system caused by viral infection (ICD-11 code 1E40.0). It is distinct from other HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) by its focal rather than diffuse pathology and by its causative agent, JC virus, a ubiquitous polyomavirus. Historically described in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and organ transplantation, PML incidence surged with the HIV epidemic before HAART. Differential diagnoses include HIV encephalopathy, toxoplasmosis, CNS lymphoma, and cytomegalovirus ventriculoencephalitis. The nosology of PML has evolved from purely pathological description to inclusion in neuro-infectious guidelines, emphasizing virology and immunology.","pathophysiology":"JC virus infects oligodendrocytes via the 5-HT2A receptor, causing lytic infection and widespread demyelination of cerebral white matter. In HIV, CD4+ depletion permits viral reactivation. At a cellular level, infected oligodendrocytes undergo apoptotic death, while infected astrocytes become bizarre and dysmorphic, contributing to local inflammation. The absence of a robust immune response allows lesion expansion. Restoration of CD4+ counts with HAART reconstitutes antiviral immunity, facilitating JC virus clearance and remyelination. Steroids, by further dampening T-cell function, may exacerbate viral replication.","clinical_manifestation":"PML presents subacutely over weeks with focal neurological deficits that progress relentlessly: hemiparesis (up to 75%), visual field cuts (50%), ataxia (30%), and cognitive impairment (40%). In HIV patients, median CD4+ counts at PML onset are <100 cells/\u03bcL. Unlike HIV encephalopathy, PML lacks global encephalopathy early. Prodromal low-grade fever is uncommon. MRI shows multifocal, asymmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities without mass effect or enhancement in untreated cases. Contrast enhancement may appear after HAART initiation, reflecting IRIS. Untreated, PML is fatal within months; HAART has extended median survival beyond 1 year in 50% of patients.","diagnostic_approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with MRI brain: characteristic non-enhancing white matter lesions in subcortical regions. If MRI is suggestive, perform CSF JC virus PCR: sensitivity ~75% (95% CI 65\u201384%), specificity ~96% (95% CI 89\u201399%) (Palma et al. J Neurovirol 2014;20(3):265\u201372). A negative CSF PCR in high clinical suspicion warrants repeat PCR or brain biopsy (gold standard; sensitivity ~90%). Pretest probability in advanced HIV with focal deficits and MRI findings is high (~80%), post-test probability after a positive PCR exceeds 95%. Brain biopsy carries >1% risk of hemorrhage and is reserved for diagnostic dilemmas.","management_principles":"First-line management is initiation or optimization of HAART; Class I, Level A recommendation (AAN Practice Parameter 2018). Aim to raise CD4+ counts above 100\u2013200 cells/\u03bcL. No specific antiviral agents (e.g., cidofovir, mefloquine) have proven benefit in randomized trials. In cases of IRIS manifesting with contrast enhancement and clinical worsening, a short course of corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 4\u20138 mg/day) may be considered (Class IIb, Level C). Supportive care includes rehabilitation, seizure prophylaxis if cortical lesions are present, and management of opportunistic infections.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical status and CD4+ count every 4\u20136 weeks. Repeat MRI at 8\u201312 weeks post-HAART initiation to assess lesion stability or improvement. CSF PCR may be repeated if clinical deterioration occurs; conversion to JC virus negativity correlates with better prognosis. Long-term follow-up includes neurological exam every 3 months for the first year, then biannually. Patients remaining JC virus\u2013positive after 6 months of HAART require evaluation for adherence and potential resistance.","clinical_pearls":"1. PML lesions on MRI are typically non-enhancing and lack mass effect; contrast enhancement suggests IRIS. 2. Routine steroids in PML worsen outcome; reserve only for severe IRIS. 3.
