Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is characterized by a steady, insidious decline in neurological function\u2014most often manifesting as progressive spastic paraparesis. Leg weakness directly reflects spinal cord involvement and continuous axonal loss. Options B (upper limb weakness), C (fatigue), and D (visual disturbances) may occur in MS generally but are not the hallmark indicators of progression in PPMS: upper limb weakness is less common early, fatigue is nonspecific, and visual disturbances are more typical of relapsing forms.","conceptual_foundation":"PPMS is one of four clinical phenotypes of MS defined by the 2013 Lublin-Reingold revision (ICD-11: 8A40.10). It differs from Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) by lack of acute attacks. Familial aggregation is lower than in SPMS or RRMS. The underlying lesion distribution is spinal-cord\u2013predominant. There is chronic microglial activation, fewer inflammatory plaques, and more neurodegeneration, correlating with progressive leg weakness.","pathophysiology":"Normal myelinated spinal tracts allow rapid conduction; in PPMS, chronic demyelination and axonal transection in lateral corticospinal tracts cause spasticity and paraparesis. Microglial-mediated neurotoxicity and persistent low-grade inflammation reduce conduction velocity and eventually block action potentials. There is less blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown than in RRMS but more diffuse neurodegeneration.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present around age 40\u201350 with gradual gait difficulty, stiffness, and leg weakness progressing over months to years. Spasticity, hyperreflexia, bladder dysfunction, and gait ataxia are common. Unlike RRMS, there are no clear relapses or remissions. Fatigue may coexist but is not a reliable marker of worsening.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis relies on clinical progression \u22651 year plus MRI showing T2 lesions in spinal cord and brain per 2017 McDonald criteria. Oligoclonal bands are positive in ~85%. Evoked potentials and CSF help exclude mimics. No new or enhancing brain lesions distinguishes PPMS from relapsing forms.","management_principles":"Ocrelizumab (anti-CD20) is the only FDA-approved DMT for PPMS, showing a 24% reduction in 12-week confirmed disability progression (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.59\u20130.98) in the ORATORIO trial. Symptomatic therapies target spasticity (baclofen, tizanidine), gait (amantadine), bladder dysfunction, and pain.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurological exam and EDSS every 6\u201312 months. MRI annually to assess new lesions. Vitals, liver function, immunoglobulin levels if on ocrelizumab. Physical therapy referral for gait training.","clinical_pearls":"1. PPMS onset is insidious with no relapses; 2. Spastic paraparesis (leg weakness) is hallmark; 3. Ocrelizumab is the only approved DMT; 4. MRI may show fewer enhancing lesions; 5. OCB positive in 85%\u2014helps confirm diagnosis.","references":"1. Lublin FD, et al. Ann Neurol. 2014;75(2):217\u2013227. DOI:10.1002/ana.24044\n2. Hauser SL, et al.
