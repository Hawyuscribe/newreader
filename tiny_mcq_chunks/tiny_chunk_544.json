Biopsy. Primary CNS angiitis (PACNS) requires histopathological confirmation through leptomeningeal and cortical sampling. Biopsy yields a sensitivity of approximately 70 to 80 percent and specificity close to 100 percent according to large series (Salvarani et al. 2007; Birnbaum and Hellmann 2009). In contrast, CTA (option A) and MRI (option C) may show vessel irregularities or parenchymal lesions but have lower sensitivity and specificity and high false negative rates. Digital subtraction angiography improves detection but cannot reliably distinguish PACNS from other vasculopathies such as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome or atherosclerotic disease. Color duplex sonography (option D) is limited to extracranial vessels and has no role in PACNS diagnosis. AAN 2010 guidelines recommend brain biopsy as the definitive diagnostic method (Level B evidence). A common misconception is reliance on angiography alone without histological confirmation, which risks misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy.","conceptual_foundation":"Primary CNS angiitis is a rare inflammatory vasculitis confined to the central nervous system in the absence of systemic involvement. It is classified in ICD-11 under code 4A83.0 and is distinguished from secondary CNS vasculitis seen in systemic diseases such as lupus or polyarteritis nodosa. Historically described in the 1950s and further characterized in the 1980s, PACNS typically affects small to medium cerebral arteries. Differential diagnosis includes reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, central nervous system infections, intravascular lymphoma, and noninflammatory vasculopathies. Pathologically, PACNS may demonstrate granulomatous, lymphocytic, or necrotizing patterns of inflammation with vessel wall destruction. The classification of PACNS has evolved to incorporate vessel wall imaging modalities but remains anchored by histopathology.","pathophysiology":"Under normal conditions, cerebral vessels maintain blood flow through autoregulation involving endothelial, myogenic, and neurogenic mechanisms. In PACNS, an aberrant immune response leads to transmural infiltration by T lymphocytes, macrophages, and sometimes multinucleated giant cells. This results in vessel wall destruction, luminal narrowing, ischemia, and sometimes hemorrhage. Endothelial injury triggers proinflammatory cytokine release, complement activation, and recruitment of additional immune cells. Over time, chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis and permanent vascular occlusion. The pathological changes correlate with clinical symptoms such as headache, cognitive decline, and focal deficits.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with PACNS most commonly present with insidious onset of headache, seen in up to 80 percent of cases, accompanied by cognitive dysfunction in nearly 50 percent. Focal neurological deficits, including hemiparesis, aphasia, and ataxia, occur in approximately 60 percent. Seizures are reported in 20 to 40 percent. Rarely, acute presentations with hemorrhage or stroke-like syndromes occur. Without treatment, PACNS follows a relapsing course leading to progressive neurological decline, stroke, and increased morbidity. Diagnostic criteria include sustained symptoms for at least four weeks, exclusion of secondary causes, MRI abnormalities, CSF pleocytosis in approximately 60 percent, and histological confirmation.","diagnostic_approach":"A systematic diagnostic approach begins with MRI of the brain with contrast, which shows multifocal hyperintense T2 lesions, leptomeningeal enhancement, and vessel wall thickening. CSF analysis typically reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein. Digital subtraction angiography is considered second-tier, showing segmental narrowing and beading in medium and small vessels but with false negative rates up to 30 percent. Definitive diagnosis requires leptomeningeal and cortical biopsy targeting regions with imaging abnormalities. Biopsy offers near 100 percent specificity. Alternative imaging such as vessel wall MRI may aid in localizing biopsy targets.","management_principles":"Management of PACNS involves induction therapy with high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. The regimen commonly used is methylprednisolone 1 gram IV daily for five days followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg with gradual taper over 12 months. Cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 IV monthly for six months is added for severe or refractory cases, as supported by observational cohorts demonstrating improved remission rates. Maintenance therapy may include azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Therapy duration typically extends for at least 18 months to reduce relapse risk. Close monitoring for immunosuppression-related adverse events is essential.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes clinical assessment every one to three months and MRI every three to six months to monitor lesion evolution or new inflammatory activity. CSF analysis may be repeated if clinical or imaging findings worsen. Steroid tapering should be guided by both clinical stability and imaging normalization. Maintenance immunosuppression is adjusted based on relapse risk and drug tolerability. Long-term prognosis depends on rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation; early intervention correlates with better neurological outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Brain biopsy is the gold standard for PACNS diagnosis and should not be omitted when clinical suspicion is high. 2. A negative angiogram does not exclude PACNS due to involvement of small vessels beyond angiographic resolution. 3. CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein are present in approximately 60 percent but are not specific. 4. Combination therapy with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide achieves higher remission rates than steroids alone. 5. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent irreversible ischemic damage and improve outcomes.","references":"1. Salvarani C, Brown RD Jr, Hunder GG.

Option A (10\u201320%): This low estimate derives from historical isolated optic neuritis cohorts lacking periventricular lesions. In a five\u2010year follow-up of 300 patients without Dawson\u2019s fingers, only 12\u201318% developed MS, leading some to underappreciate lesion location\u2019s predictive value. Misconception: applying optic neuritis data to CIS with typical MS patterns yields falsely low risk.\n\nB. Option B (30\u201350%): Reflects mid-range conversions in heterogeneous clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) series. A 2015 study of CIS with juxtacortical but not periventricular lesions showed 40% conversion at three years. Clinicians misapply this to periventricular involvement, ignoring that Dawson\u2019s finger morphology doubles risk versus nonspecific white matter spots.\n\nC. Option C (44\u201393%): Correct. Meta-analyses report 44% five-year conversion when \u22651 periventricular lesion is present, rising to 93% at ten years with two or more Dawson\u2019s fingers (pathophysiology: perivenular inflammation and myelin\u2010antigen presentation along Virchow-Robin spaces). Misconception: interpreting any abnormal MRI (e.g., nonspecific T2 foci) as equivalent to classic periventricular demyelination.\n\nD. Option D (60\u201380%): Overestimates medium-term risk. In progressive CIS with both periventricular and juxtacortical lesions, five-year conversion approaches 60%, but early single\u2010lesion cases convert closer to 45%. Misapplying progressive CIS data to all abnormal scans inflates risk estimates.","conceptual_foundation":"Multiple sclerosis primarily targets central nervous system white matter, especially periventricular regions adjacent to lateral ventricles, corpus callosum splenium, optic nerves, brainstem, and cervical spinal cord. Anatomically, lesions localize along periventricular medullary veins (Virchow-Robin spaces), forming ovoid Dawson\u2019s fingers oriented perpendicular to ventricular surfaces. Embryologically, these periventricular zones derive from dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium, rich in vascular channels facilitating immune cell infiltration. Normally, myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes insulate axons, facilitating saltatory conduction and maintaining ion homeostasis via Na+/K+-ATPase and voltage-gated channels. Disruption yields conduction block and neurophysiological deficits. Related demyelinating syndromes include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4 antibody-mediated astrocytopathy), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and leukodystrophies. Historically, Jean-Martin Charcot in 1868 first described MS plaques in periventricular white matter. Modern MRI criteria evolved from Paty\u2019s 1988 CT-based scheme to 2017 McDonald revisions emphasizing dissemination in space/time. Key landmarks: corpus callosum roof adjacent to lateral ventricles, centrum semiovale, periaqueductal gray, spinal cord lateral columns\u2014each site conveying distinct clinical syndromes when lesioned.","pathophysiology":"MS arises from interplay between adaptive immunity and CNS antigens. Molecularly, autoreactive CD4+ Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes recognizing myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) cross a compromised blood\u2013brain barrier via upregulated VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, mediated by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17 cytokines. B cells produce oligoclonal IgG bands intrathecally, supporting complement-dependent demyelination. Ion channel redistribution (Nav1.6 upregulation) in demyelinated axons partially maintains conduction but increases energy demand, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Genetic predisposition involves HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele (OR 3.0), with GWAS implicating IL2RA and TNFRSF1A loci. Lesion evolution: initial perivenular infiltration peaks within days, followed by microglial activation and astrogliosis over weeks; chronic plaques show remyelination failure due to oligodendrocyte progenitor cell exhaustion. Compensatory mechanisms include sodium channel redistribution and cortical plasticity, but these wane with lesion burden. Energy metabolism shifts toward glycolysis, increasing lactate and depleting ATP reserves, exacerbating axonal loss over months to years.","clinical_manifestation":"MS typically presents between ages 20\u201340, female:male ratio 3:1. Onset may be acute (optic neuritis over days) or subacute (brainstem syndrome). Symptom timeline: initial sensory disturbances peak within one week, partial recovery by three months; relapses last \u226524 hours separated by \u226530 days. Neurological exam reveals asymmetric weakness (UMN signs: hyperreflexia, Babinski), sensory level, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, Lhermitte\u2019s sign, and cerebellar ataxia. Pediatric MS under age 18 shows more polyfocal presentations, while late-onset (>50) exhibits more progressive course. Systemic fatigue and Uhthoff\u2019s phenomenon occur under heat. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) grades disability from 0 (normal) to 10 (death); an initial relapse often scores 2\u20133. Red flags: rapid progression (<6 months) suggests neuromyelitis optica, while optic nerve enhancement sparing chiasm may indicate idiopathic neuritis. Without treatment, 50% reach EDSS 6.0 (unilateral assistance) by 15 years. Secondary progressive transition occurs in 80% by 25 years.
