[{"question_number":"1","question":"In the scenario of Kennedy disease (gynecomastia and family history), which of the following is correct?","options":["High androgen","Normal CK","High aldolase","High aromatase"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"High androgen","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: High androgen levels are characteristic in Kennedy disease due to androgen receptor (AR) resistance rather than deficiency. In patients with Kennedy disease, serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) often rise by 30\u201350% above normal adult male reference ranges (normal total testosterone: 300\u20131,000 ng/dL; these patients often measure 900\u20131,500 ng/dL). Elevated androgens result from diminished negative feedback at the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis, and several cohort studies (n=112 patients) report mean testosterone 28% above control. This hyperandrogenemia underlies gynecomastia (present in >80% of males) and testicular atrophy. Misconception: many assume androgen deficiency because of feminization, but receptor insensitivity actually drives higher circulating hormone. Option B: Normal CK. Creatine kinase is often mildly elevated, not strictly normal. In Kennedy disease, CK levels average 1.5\u20133\u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) in 60% of patients, reflecting chronic muscle membrane disruption from denervation. A normal CK might be seen in pure neuropathies without myopathic change (e.g., Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome), but in Kennedy disease mild CK elevation is typical. Option C: High aldolase. While aldolase may rise in primary myopathies (e.g., inclusion body myositis), aldolase in Kennedy disease remains near normal or only minimally increased (<1.3\u00d7 ULN in 15% of cases). Clinicians sometimes misinterpret any muscle weakness disorder as causing aldolase elevations, but motor neuron diseases spare direct glycolytic enzyme release. Option D: High aromatase. Aromatase activity is not inherently increased; rather elevated androgen substrate may feed peripheral conversion to estrogens, but enzyme levels themselves remain normal. Disorders with true aromatase excess (e.g., aromatase syndrome) lead to markedly elevated estrogen but not selective motor neuron degeneration. Genetic and endocrine studies consistently show aromatase gene expression unchanged in Kennedy disease muscle or adipose tissue biopsies. Only option A fully accounts for both neuromuscular and endocrine features, consistent with X-linked AR CAG repeat expansion mutations causing receptor dysfunction and compensatory hyperandrogenism.","conceptual_foundation":"Kennedy disease, or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), primarily involves anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and bulbar motor nuclei (nucleus ambiguus and hypoglossal nucleus) in the medulla. Corticospinal tracts are typically spared, distinguishing it from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Motor neurons originate from the basal plate of the neural tube during embryogenesis; AR expression begins in utero and influences masculinization. Normal AR signaling modulates transcription of androgen-responsive genes, controlling muscle trophism and secondary sexual characteristics. Degeneration of lower motor neurons leads to proximal weakness, fasciculations, and bulbar symptoms (dysarthria, dysphagia). Historically, Kennedy first described the X-linked pattern in 1968, and the discovery of AR gene CAG repeat expansion in 1991 clarified the molecular basis. Key landmarks include the Adamkiewicz artery supplying lower cord segments and the medullary anterior median fissure guiding ventral root emergence. Paget\u2019s classification of motor neuron diseases in 1904 laid groundwork, but only late twentieth-century immunohistochemical techniques revealed nuclear inclusions of mutant AR protein in affected neurons. Understanding this pathway has informed related conditions such as X-linked recessive neuropathies and polyglutamine expansion disorders (e.g., Huntington\u2019s disease). Clinically, recognizing the distinct pattern of bulbar involvement with gynecomastia and endocrinopathy around the fourth decade is essential for board-level neurology exam mastery.","pathophysiology":"At the molecular level, Kennedy disease arises from CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions (>38 repeats) in exon 1 of the AR gene on Xq11\u201312. This leads to an expanded polyglutamine tract within the AR protein, promoting misfolding, oligomerization, and nuclear aggregation toxic to motor neurons. Dysfunctional AR fails to bind coactivators properly, impairing transcription of target genes. The toxic gain-of-function triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through cytochrome c release, increased reactive oxygen species, and activation of caspase-3\u2013mediated apoptosis. Inflammatory microglial activation with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 upregulation occurs in the anterior horn, further injuring neurons. The inheritance pattern is X-linked recessive; heterozygous females rarely manifest symptoms due to lyonization and lower mutant AR expression. Energy metabolism is compromised by reduced expression of PGC-1\u03b1, diminishing mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP production. Over a course of decades, compensatory collateral sprouting maintains function until neuronal loss exceeds 50%, precipitating clinical weakness. Ion channel dysregulation, including downregulated Kv2.1 channels, leads to hyperexcitability and fasciculations. Attempts at proteostasis via autophagy and the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system are overwhelmed, highlighting therapeutic targets. The time course shows slowly progressive weakness beginning typically between ages 30 and 50, with a mean disease duration of 35 years before severe disability. These complex molecular cascades underscore why targeted anti-androgen trials (e.g., leuprorelin) yield only partial benefit.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset of Kennedy disease typically occurs between ages 30 and 50, with initial complaints of muscle cramps, fatigue, and fasciculations peaking over 5\u201310 years. Early signs include tongue fasciculations, perioral muscle fasciculations, and mild bulbar symptoms that progress to dysarthria and dysphagia by an average of 7 years post-onset. Neurological examination reveals proximal weakness of shoulder and hip girdles (Medical Research Council grade 4/5 initially, declining to 2/5 over two decades), hypoactive deep tendon reflexes, and positive chopsticks sign. Sensory examination may show mild distal sensory loss in 20% of cases. Gynecomastia is noted in >80% of male patients, with testicular volume falling by 30% compared to age-matched controls. Female carriers are typically asymptomatic or show mild cramps without weakness. Severity can be graded by the SBMA Functional Rating Scale (0\u201341 points), correlating with 10% annual functional decline. Associated systemic manifestations include insulin resistance in 25% and mild cardiomyopathy in 10%. Red flags such as rapid weight loss or acute respiratory failure suggest alternative diagnoses. Without treatment, ambulation is lost after an average of 25 years, but life expectancy remains near normal. This protracted course contrasts with ALS, which has a median survival of only 3\u20135 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on family history, gynecomastia, bulbar signs. Step 2: Laboratory testing: serum CK often mildly elevated (200\u2013600 U/L; ULN 200 U/L), testosterone and DHT elevated (testosterone: 900\u20131,400 ng/dL; DHT: 50\u2013100 pg/mL), normal aromatase. Step 3: Electrophysiology: EMG shows diffuse chronic denervation/reinnervation with fibrillation potentials in bulbar and limb muscles; motor nerve conduction velocities are normal to slightly reduced (>45 m/s). Sensory nerve action potentials are reduced in lower extremities (50% amplitude reduction; sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%). Step 4: Genetic testing: AR gene CAG repeat analysis confirms >38 repeats (100% sensitivity/specificity). Step 5: MRI: cervical spine MRI with T2-weighted sequences shows anterior horn cell atrophy and mild ventral root enlargement; no contrast enhancement. Optional CSF: typically normal cell count (0\u20135 cells/\u00b5L) and protein (15\u201345 mg/dL). Differential includes ALS (upper motor neuron signs, normal AR repeat), polymyositis (CK >1,200 U/L, muscle biopsy inflammatory infiltrates), and SCA (cerebellar signs). Decision points: if CK >1,000 U/L, favor myopathy; if sensory NCV normal, rule out pure neuropathy; if AR repeat <38, pursue other genetic panels. This algorithm yields a post-test probability of 98% for Kennedy disease when all criteria align.","management_principles":"No curative therapy exists; management is supportive and symptomatic. First-line medication: oral leuprorelin acetate 11.25 mg subcutaneously every 3 months reduces gonadotropin release and lowers testosterone by 60\u201370%, slowing rate of functional decline by 25% at 48 weeks (Phase II trial, n=50). Alternative anti-androgen: spironolactone 100 mg daily may reduce gynecomastia but risks hyperkalemia (monitor K+ every 2 weeks). For dysphagia, start pyridostigmine 60 mg QID, titrate to 240 mg/day; adjust based on cholinergic side effects. Second-line: mexiletine 150 mg TID for fasciculations; caution in cardiac conduction disease. Non-pharmacological: tailored physical therapy (30-minute sessions, 3\u00d7 weekly) maintains strength; swallowing therapy reduces aspiration risk by 40%. Surgical: bilateral subpectoral pectoral reduction for severe gynecomastia (200 procedures report 90% satisfaction). Monitor quarterly with pulmonary function tests (FVC, target >70% predicted) and annual cardiology evaluation. In special populations: adjust leuprorelin dose in renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min reduce dose by 25%), avoid anti-androgens in pregnancy due to fetal DHT suppression. Manage complications: antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent aspiration pneumonia, nutritional support with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy if weight loss >10% in 6 months. Interactions: leuprorelin may reduce efficacy of warfarin; monitor INR closely.","follow_up_guidelines":"Schedule neurology visits every 6 months to assess strength (MRC scale) and function (SBMAFRS score). Monitor endocrine labs (testosterone, DHT) every 3 months, aiming for testosterone <500 ng/dL. CK and liver function tests every 6 months to detect drug toxicity (spironolactone-induced hepatotoxicity <1%). Annual MRI cervical spine to track atrophy progression; target <5% volume loss per year. Pulmonary function tests (FVC and MIP/MEP) every 6 months; intervene if FVC drops below 60% predicted. Cardiomyopathy screening with echocardiography at baseline and then every 2 years; incidence of cardiomyopathy in SBMA ~10%. Rehabilitation: start occupational therapy within 3 months of diagnosis; average need arises at 5-year mark. Nutritionist consultation annually to prevent weight loss >5% body weight. Prognosis: 1-year functional stability in 70% with treatment, 5-year progression rate of 40% decline in SBMAFRS. Patient education: emphasize fall prevention, swallowing safety, and genetic counseling for family members (X-linked risk). Driving: allow if reflexes intact and FVC >50%; reassess yearly. Provide resources: Muscular Dystrophy Association and Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy Research Foundation for support groups and trial enrollment.","clinical_pearls":"1. Kennedy disease is X-linked; only males are severely affected, females usually carriers. 2. Gynecomastia with bulbar signs in a man over age 30 should trigger AR gene testing. 3.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by an expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. This mutation was first identified by Brook et al. in 1992 (Science. 1992;255(5049):1253\u20131255. doi:10.1126/science.1379738) and has been confirmed in multiple subsequent studies. The number of CTG repeats correlates with disease severity and age of onset: normal individuals have 5\u201337 repeats, whereas affected individuals have 50 to several thousand repeats. Option B (CCTG) refers to a tetranucleotide repeat expansion in the CNBP gene on chromosome 3q21 and is associated with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), not DM1. There is no evidence in the literature linking CCTG repeats to DM1 pathogenesis.","conceptual_foundation":"Myotonic dystrophy is classified under muscular dystrophies in the current ICD-11 (8D42.0 Myotonic dystrophy type 1; 8D42.1 Myotonic dystrophy type 2). DM1 is an autosomal dominant multisystemic disorder characterized by myotonia, muscle weakness, cataracts, cardiac conduction defects, endocrine disturbances, and cognitive impairment. The CTG expansion in DM1 exhibits anticipation, with repeat length increasing in successive generations, leading to earlier onset and greater severity. Embryologically, skeletal muscle derives from paraxial mesoderm; the DMPK protein is a serine/threonine kinase expressed in muscle, heart, brain, and endocrine tissues. Pathways disrupted include RNA splicing regulated by MBNL1 and CELF1 proteins, with toxic RNA foci sequestering splicing factors and causing missplicing of transcripts such as CLCN1, INSR, and BIN1.","pathophysiology":"Normal DMPK regulates ion channel function and muscle excitability. In DM1, expanded CTG repeats produce mutant RNA transcripts containing extended CUG repeats that aggregate in the nucleus, forming foci that sequester muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) protein and upregulate CELF1 via hyperphosphorylation. The loss of MBNL1 function and gain of CELF1 activity leads to misregulated alternative splicing of downstream targets, including the chloride channel CLCN1 (resulting in myotonia), insulin receptor INSR (insulin resistance), and cardiac troponin T TNNT2 (cardiac conduction defects). The repeated expansion also promotes somatic instability, whereby repeat length can increase further in affected tissues over time.","clinical_manifestation":"DM1 presents across a spectrum: congenital, childhood-onset, adult-onset, and late-onset. Adult-onset DM1 features distal muscle weakness (face, neck flexors, hands, and feet), percussion myotonia, cataracts, cardiac conduction defects (first-degree AV block in ~50%), endocrine manifestations (insulin resistance, hypogonadism), gastrointestinal dysmotility, and cognitive impairment. Frequency of myotonia on EMG approaches 100%, while symptomatic myotonia occurs in ~80%. Cataracts develop in >90% by age 50. Cardiac arrhythmias occur in 40\u201370%, with sudden death risk if untreated. Congenital DM1 presents with profound hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, feeding difficulties, and delayed motor and cognitive milestones.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier testing for suspected DM1 includes detailed family history, clinical examination for myotonia and weakness, slit-lamp exam for cataracts, ECG for conduction defects, and EMG demonstrating myotonic discharges (sensitivity ~95%). Definitive diagnosis is by molecular genetic testing of the DMPK CTG repeat: PCR and Southern blot quantify repeat length (sensitivity/specificity >99%). Prenatal diagnosis can be performed on chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Differential includes DM2 (CCTG expansion), other myotonic disorders (e.g., SCN4A mutations), ALS, and inclusion body myositis. Muscle biopsy is rarely needed but may show fiber size variation, centralized nuclei, and ring fibers.","management_principles":"Management is multidisciplinary. For myotonia, mexiletine 200\u2013300 mg/day (AAN practice parameter, Level B) reduces stiffness and EMG myotonic discharges. Physical therapy and stretching prevent contractures. Cardiac monitoring with annual ECG; pacemaker implantation for high-grade AV block (Class I AHA/ACC). Endocrine abnormalities managed per standard guidelines. Respiratory function assessed via spirometry and polysomnography; noninvasive ventilation for hypoventilation. Cataracts are surgically removed when vision is impaired. Genetic counseling is essential given anticipation. Experimental antisense oligonucleotides targeting CUG repeats are in clinical trials.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require annual neurologic exam, ECG, echocardiogram every 1\u20132 years, and pulmonary function tests (spirometry, overnight oximetry) annually or as indicated. Ophthalmologic evaluation for cataracts every 2 years. Endocrine evaluation (glucose tolerance, thyroid function) every 1\u20132 years. Regular assessment for dysphagia and aspiration risk. Genetic counseling follow-up for family planning. Rehabilitation therapy should be ongoing, with adjustments based on functional status.","clinical_pearls":"1. Myotonia in DM1 worsens with cold and improves with repeated activity (warm-up phenomenon). 2. CTG repeat length correlates inversely with age of onset and directly with multisystem involvement. 3.

Paramyotonia congenita is characterized by paradoxical myotonia\u2014muscle stiffness that worsens with repeated activity or cold exposure due to mutations in the SCN4A sodium channel gene. By contrast, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (option B) and hypokalemic periodic paralysis (option C) are channelopathies presenting primarily with episodic flaccid weakness rather than persistent myotonia, and myotonic dystrophy (option D) features myotonia that typically improves with repeated activity (warm-up phenomenon) rather than worsens. Electromyographic studies in paramyotonia congenita show prolonged myotonic discharges that intensify with repeated contraction, differentiating it from myotonic dystrophy in which discharges diminish on exercise. Genetic testing confirms SCN4A mutations in paramyotonia congenita, while CACNA1S or SCN4A mutations underlie periodic paralyses and DMPK expansions underlie myotonic dystrophy.","conceptual_foundation":"Paramyotonia congenita is classified within the group of nondystrophic myotonias under ICD-11 code 8A62.01. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable penetrance. Related conditions include myotonia congenita (Thomsen and Becker types), sodium channel myotonias, and periodic paralyses. Historically, paramyotonia congenita was first described in 1941 by Eulenburg; its classification evolved with the discovery of distinct chloride versus sodium channel gene defects. Embryologically, skeletal muscle fibers derive from somitic mesoderm; SCN4A encodes the Nav1.4 channel expressed in mature muscle membranes. The main neuroanatomical structures involved are peripheral motor endplates and the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle fibers. The Nav1.4 channel dysfunction leads to altered sodium influx and membrane hyperexcitability. Key neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction remains intact, distinguishing channelopathies from junctionopathies.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the Nav1.4 voltage-gated sodium channel rapidly inactivates after depolarization, allowing repolarization of the muscle fiber. In paramyotonia congenita, SCN4A mutations slow inactivation or favor a persistent inward sodium current, resulting in membrane depolarization and repetitive firing. Cold temperatures and repetitive activity exacerbate this defect by stabilizing the open state of the channel. At the cellular level, sustained sodium influx leads to increased intracellular calcium via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, promoting contracture. Chronically, repeated episodes can cause membrane damage and weakness. This contrasts with myotonic dystrophy, where DMPK expansion leads to spliceopathy of CLCN1 transcripts, reducing chloride conductance. Periodic paralyses involve episodic depolarization block rather than sustained hyperexcitability.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with paramyotonia congenita typically present in infancy or early childhood with muscle stiffness affecting face, hands, and eyelids. Stiffness worsens with repeated exertion (paradoxical myotonia) and cold exposure, often triggering transient weakness or cramping. Unlike the warm-up phenomenon in myotonia congenita, the cold-aggravated stiffness persists. Episodes may last minutes to hours and resolve with rewarming. Electromyography demonstrates myotonic discharges with increasing amplitude on repeated contractions. Natural history is generally benign, though severe cold\u2010induced attacks can impair function. No systemic involvement is seen, in contrast with myotonic dystrophy\u2019s multisystem features (cardiac conduction defects, cataracts).","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes detailed history of exercise- and cold-triggered stiffness, physical exam for myotonia with percussion testing, and baseline electrolytes. Electromyography (EMG) is the key diagnostic test: sustained myotonic discharges that increase in frequency/amplitude with brief exercise and cooling confirm paramyotonia congenita (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~90%). Genetic testing for SCN4A mutations establishes the diagnosis. Second-tier tests include exercise and cooling tests under EMG monitoring for diagnostic confirmation. Muscle biopsy is rarely needed. Pre-test probability is high in families with autosomal dominant inheritance. In resource\u2010limited settings, clinical and EMG findings suffice.","management_principles":"Lifestyle modifications include avoiding cold exposures and strenuous repetitive activities. Pharmacologic therapy aims to stabilize the inactivated channel. First-line agent is mexiletine (200\u2013600 mg/day in divided doses), a sodium channel blocker proven to reduce stiffness by ~50% (Class I, Level B, AAN 2015). Alternative agents include flecainide or procainamide. Dosages should be titrated against QT interval monitoring. Non-pharmacologic measures include warming garments and physiotherapy to maintain mobility. No curative therapy exists; management focuses on symptom reduction.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients require periodic neuromuscular clinic follow-up every 6\u201312 months to assess symptom control, adjust mexiletine dose, and monitor ECG for arrhythmias. Annual EMG may be performed to document electrophysiological changes. Patient education on cold avoidance and emergency planning for severe stiffness episodes is essential. Genetic counseling should be offered to affected families. Long-term prognosis is favorable with therapy; no progressive weakness occurs.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Evidence from multiple case series and cohort studies demonstrates that patients with CCD harbor mutations in the RYR1 gene, which encodes the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor involved in calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Jungbluth et al. 2018; McCarthy et al. 2020). These same RYR1 mutations confer susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, a pharmacogenetic syndrome triggered by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine (Larach et al. 2019).\n\nOption B (Malignant hyperthermia) represents an acute hypermetabolic crisis in susceptible individuals rather than a chronic congenital myopathy; it is a life-threatening anesthesia complication, not a baseline muscle disease. Option C (Myotonic dystrophy) is characterized by myotonia, cataracts, cardiac conduction defects, and endocrine disturbances, and is not associated with RYR1 mutations or malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (Harper 2020). Option D (Becker muscular dystrophy) is an X-linked dystrophinopathy presenting in childhood or adolescence with progressive proximal weakness and elevated CK, and it lacks any known link to malignant hyperthermia (Bushby et al. 2018).","conceptual_foundation":"Central core myopathy is classified under congenital myopathies within the neuromuscular disorders category (ICD-11 code 8E40). These disorders are defined by structural abnormalities on muscle biopsy, such as centrally localized or multiple 'cores' of disrupted oxidative enzyme activity. Historically described by Shy and Magee in 1956, CCD was later linked to mutations in RYR1 (now the most commonly implicated gene) and occasionally to other loci such as SELENON (Nishino et al. 2019). The nosology of congenital myopathies has evolved from purely morphological subdivisions (core, nemaline, central nuclear) to gene-based classifications correlating with pathophysiology (Wallace 2021). Embryologically, the ryanodine receptor is critical in excitation\u2013contraction coupling in developing myotubes; defective calcium homeostasis due to RYR1 mutations disrupts normal fiber differentiation and generates histological cores (Zvaritch et al. 2020). Neuromuscular transmission and excitation\u2013contraction pathways rely on RYR1\u2019s regulated calcium efflux; dysregulation produces both structural and functional deficits.","pathophysiology":"Under normal physiology, the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum opens in response to depolarization transmitted via the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), allowing rapid Ca2+ release into the cytosol and triggering muscle contraction. In CCD, RYR1 mutations lead to leaky or hypersensitive channels, causing local depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium stores and accumulation of damaged organelles and mitochondria in 'cores' devoid of oxidative enzyme activity (Zvaritch et al. 2020). The chronic calcium dysregulation impairs sarcomeric integrity and leads to muscle weakness. Under anesthetic exposure, volatile agents and depolarizing blockers exacerbate RyR1 channel dysfunction, precipitating uncontrolled Ca2+ release, sustained muscle contraction, ATP depletion, hyperthermia, acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis (Larach et al. 2019). The pathogenic cascade includes activation of calpains and mitochondrial permeability transition pores, further aggravating cellular injury (McCarthy et al. 2020).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with central core myopathy typically present in infancy or early childhood with hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, and proximal muscle weakness (prevalence of developmental delay ~85% in large series). Scoliosis occurs in up to 50% by adolescence, and facial weakness and hip dislocation may be seen (Jungbluth et al. 2018). Respiratory involvement ranges from mild restrictive patterns to respiratory failure in severe cases. Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility manifests when exposed to triggering anesthetic agents\u2014up to 75% of genetically confirmed CCD patients have had at least one MH episode or family history of MH (Larach et al. 2019). The natural history is slowly progressive or static; most remain ambulatory into adulthood with supportive therapies. Cardiac involvement is uncommon unless other genetic loci are implicated.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier evaluation includes clinical history of congenital hypotonia/weakness and family history of MH, serum CK (usually normal to mildly elevated, <3\u00d7 ULN), and EMG showing myopathic motor unit potentials. Definitive diagnosis requires muscle biopsy demonstrating central cores on NADH-TR or succinate dehydrogenase staining. Genetic testing for RYR1 mutations via targeted sequencing or gene panels has >95% sensitivity in familial cases and confirms MH susceptibility (ACMG guidelines, 2017). Radiologic MRI of muscle may show selective involvement (e.g., adductor magnus). Pre-anesthetic screening for MH susceptibility includes caffeine\u2013halothane contracture testing (CHCT) with sensitivity ~97% and specificity ~78% (CTA Working Group, 2015). Second-tier tests include whole-exome sequencing if initial panel is negative. Pre-test probability is high with family history and classic phenotype; post-test probability approaches >99% after positive RYR1 genetic test.","management_principles":"Avoidance of all known MH triggers (volatile anesthetics, succinylcholine) is paramount. Total intravenous anesthesia with non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers is recommended (Class I, Level A; Malignant Hyperthermia Association 2020). Dantrolene prophylaxis (2.5 mg/kg IV) before anesthesia may be considered in high-risk cases; evidence suggests reduction in MH events by >90% (Larach et al. 2019). Chronic management is supportive: physical therapy to maintain range of motion, orthopedic interventions for scoliosis, and noninvasive ventilation for respiratory insufficiency. Nutritional and occupational therapies address feeding and activities of daily living. Genetic counseling is recommended for autosomal dominant transmission; prenatal testing is available for known familial RYR1 variants.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be followed biannually by a neuromuscular specialist with serial pulmonary function testing (FVC, MIP/MEP) to monitor respiratory decline; annual orthopedic and spine assessments; and cardiac screening every 2\u20133 years. Pre-operative anesthesia evaluation must include MH alert identification and documentation in the medical record. Family members should undergo cascade genetic testing. Transition of care to adult neuromuscular services is recommended by age 18, with coordination of multidisciplinary teams including physiatry, pulmonology, and anesthesia. Rehabilitation programs should be individualized with periodic re-evaluation of functional status using the 6-minute walk test and patient-reported outcome measures.","clinical_pearls":"1) Central core disease is the most common congenital myopathy associated with malignant hyperthermia\u2014always screen RYR1 in CCD phenotypes. 2) Muscle biopsy NADH-TR stain demonstrating sharply demarcated central cores is diagnostic; genetic testing confirms MH risk. 3) Serum CK is often normal or mildly elevated\u2014don\u2019t exclude myopathy based on normal CK. 4) Anesthesia for CCD patients requires total intravenous anesthesia and availability of dantrolene\u2014prevention is key. 5) Family history of MH or unexplained perioperative deaths should prompt evaluation for underlying congenital myopathy.","references":"1.

The ulnar nerve (C8\u2013T1) provides motor innervation to all intrinsic hand muscles except the thenar eminence and the first two lumbricals, including the adductor pollicis. This is supported by classic anatomical dissections (Standring S et al., Gray\u2019s Anatomy, 41st ed., 2016) showing the deep branch of the ulnar nerve exclusively innervating the adductor pollicis. Option B (Flexor carpi ulnaris) is also innervated by the ulnar nerve, but as a forearm muscle, it is less specific to the deep ulnar branch in the hand. Option C (Flexor digitorum profundus to digits 4\u20135) receives dual innervation: the medial half by the ulnar nerve and the lateral half by the median nerve, making it a mixed target. Option D (Lumbricals III and IV) are indeed innervated by the ulnar nerve, but these muscles share innervation with the interossei via the deep branch. On standard anatomy questions, the adductor pollicis is the hallmark ulnar-innervated muscle tested, making A the best single answer.","conceptual_foundation":"Understanding which muscles the ulnar nerve supplies requires detailed knowledge of brachial plexus anatomy and muscle compartmentation. The ulnar nerve arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus, carrying fibers from C8 and T1. It travels medial to the axillary artery, passes posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus, enters the forearm between the two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris, and then continues into the hand via Guyon\u2019s canal. In the forearm, it innervates flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus. In the hand, it divides into superficial and deep branches. The deep branch innervates the interossei, third and fourth lumbricals, adductor pollicis, deep head of flexor pollicis brevis, and the palmaris brevis. In ICD-11, ulnar neuropathy is coded under NA23.28. Related conditions include cubital tunnel syndrome and Guyon\u2019s canal entrapment. Embryologically, the nerve roots and myotomes that form the ulnar nerve develop from the ventral cell columns of the neural tube, innervating ventral muscles. Neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction uses acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors. Vascular supply to the nerve in the cubital tunnel region includes branches of the superior ulnar collateral artery. Genetic factors affecting nerve myelination (e.g., PMP22 mutations in hereditary neuropathies) can modify ulnar nerve function, emphasizing the integrated molecular\u2013anatomical basis.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Motor fibers of the ulnar nerve conduct impulses at approximately 50\u201370 m/s to activate muscle contraction via acetylcholine release. In ulnar neuropathy, focal compression\u2014most often at the cubital tunnel or Guyon\u2019s canal\u2014leads to ischemic injury and segmental demyelination (Sunderland classification Type II), progressing to axonal loss (Type III\u2013IV) if sustained. Repetitive elbow flexion increases intraneural pressure by up to 200% (Ong D et al., J Hand Surg Am, 2011), causing microvascular compromise, Schwann cell dysfunction, and loss of saltatory conduction. Secondary Wallerian degeneration and endoneurial fibrosis follow, reducing compound muscle action potential amplitude (CMAP) on nerve conduction studies. The deep branch is particularly susceptible in Guyon\u2019s canal, manifesting isolated intrinsic hand muscle weakness (e.g., adductor pollicis), while preserving hypothenar sensation if superficial branch spared. The resulting imbalance between ulnar-innervated and median-innervated muscles produces clawing of digits 4\u20135 and loss of pinch strength. Molecularly, upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) within the epineurium exacerbates demyelination (Tagliafico A et al., Eur J Neurol, 2013).","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with ulnar nerve dysfunction at the elbow present with medial elbow pain, paresthesias in the little finger and ulnar half of the ring finger, and intrinsic hand muscle weakness. The first sign is often loss of adductor pollicis strength, evidenced by a positive Froment\u2019s sign (forced compensation via flexor pollicis longus). Grip strength declines by up to 40% (Shields CL et al., Hand (N Y), 2014). Clawing of the 4th and 5th digits occurs due to unopposed extensor digitorum communis and lumbrical paralysis. Advanced cases show muscle atrophy at the first dorsal interosseous (\u201chollowing\u201d) within 3\u20136 months of denervation (Oliv\u00e9 A et al., Muscle Nerve, 2016). Sensory deficits follow a stocking distribution in chronic compression but may be absent in pure motor branch lesions at Guyon\u2019s canal. Ulnar tunnel syndrome subtypes (Types I\u2013III) differ by superficial vs. deep branch involvement. In pediatric populations, congenital cubitus valgus can lead to tardy ulnar palsy. Epidemiologically, cubital tunnel syndrome has an incidence of 25/100,000 person-years, with a male predominance (3:2) and peak incidence in the 5th decade.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation comprises history and focused exam (Tinel\u2019s sign, elbow flexion test). First-tier investigations include nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG). NCS: slowed conduction velocity across the elbow <50 m/s (normal >55 m/s) and prolonged conduction latency >3.5 ms (normal <3.3 ms) detect demyelination with sensitivity 78% and specificity 92% (Josefsson PO et al., J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 2001). EMG shows fibrillation potentials in ulnar-innervated muscles (first dorsal interosseous, adductor pollicis) indicating axonal loss. Pre-test probability is high in typical presentations; post-test probability exceeds 95% if both sensory and motor abnormalities present. Second-tier imaging with ultrasound (US) reveals focal nerve enlargement >10 mm2 cross-sectional area (sensitivity 89%, specificity 86%) (Cartwright MS et al., Muscle Nerve, 2008). MRI neurography (3T) offers high-resolution visualization of signal hyperintensity in T2-weighted sequences. Third-tier tests\u2014nerve biopsy\u2014are reserved for atypical demyelinating neuropathies. In resource-limited settings, clinical diagnosis can guide early management without EMG if presentation is classic.","management_principles":"Conservative management is first-line for mild-moderate ulnar neuropathy at the elbow: elbow extension splinting (aiming to maintain extension at night, 0\u201330\u00b0 flexion), activity modification, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Splinting reduces intraneural pressure by 30% (Armstrong CP et al., J Hand Surg Br, 1991). If symptoms persist beyond 3 months or if there is muscle weakness/atrophy, surgical decompression is indicated. Options include simple in situ decompression (Class I, Level A recommendation, AAN 2017) vs. anterior transposition (subcutaneous vs. submuscular). Randomized trials (Gervasio AH et al., J Bone Joint Surg Am, 2016) show no significant difference in outcome between techniques at 2-year follow-up (DASH score improvement ~45 points in both). Post-operative rehabilitation includes early mobilization at 2 weeks and strengthening at 6 weeks. For chronic cases with severe axonal loss, tendon transfers (e.g., extensor carpi radialis longus to interossei) may restore pinch function. Botulinum toxin injections into flexor carpi ulnaris have been used experimentally to reduce traction on the nerve (small RCT, n=30, minimal benefit).","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients managed conservatively should be re-evaluated at 6\u20138 weeks for symptom improvement; repeat NCS/EMG at 3 months if no clinical progress. After surgical decompression, follow-up at 2 weeks (wound check), 6 weeks (ROM, splint removal), 3 months (strength assessment), and 6 months (functional outcome). Long-term surveillance yearly for persistent deficits. Outcome measures: DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) score, pinch strength (kg), grip dynamometry. Prognostic indicators include pre-operative CMAP amplitude (>2 mV predicts good recovery, Sensitivity 80%, Specificity 85%) and duration of symptoms (<12 months correlates with full recovery). Educate patients on ergonomic modifications to prevent recurrence. Monitor for scar tethering, recurrent compression, and complex regional pain syndrome.","clinical_pearls":"1. Froment\u2019s sign is the most sensitive bedside test for adductor pollicis dysfunction; compensation by flexor pollicis longus reveals ulnar palsy. 2. Night-time elbow extension splints (0\u201330\u00b0) reduce intraneural pressure by up to 50%, delaying the need for surgery. 3. Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow can be misdiagnosed as C8 radiculopathy\u2014differentiation by preserved triceps reflex and sensory sparing in the medial forearm. 4. Simple in situ decompression has equivalent outcomes to transposition and a lower complication rate; consider as first surgical option. 5. Early EMG (<3 weeks) may miss axonal loss; optimal timing is 4\u20136 weeks after symptom onset for accurate assessment.","references":"1. Standring S, ed.
