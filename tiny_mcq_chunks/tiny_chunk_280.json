[{"question_number":"4","question":"In a case of spontaneous generalized chorea, which of the following options describes the phenomenology of the condition?","options":["Tics","Task-specific dystonia","Chorea","Myoclonus"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Chorea","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is C: Chorea. Spontaneous generalized chorea presents as continuous, irregular, purposeless movements that flow from one muscle group to another. Unlike tics (option A), which are brief, stereotyped, and suppressible, chorea is non-stereotyped and non-suppressible. Task-specific dystonia (option B) involves sustained muscle contractions in a particular task context. Myoclonus (option D) features sudden, shock-like jerks rather than flowing movements.","conceptual_foundation":"Chorea falls under hyperkinetic movement disorders in current nosology (ICD-11: 8E66). It can be hereditary (e.g., Huntington\u2019s disease) or acquired (e.g., Sydenham\u2019s chorea). Differential includes tics, dystonia, myoclonus, stereotypies. Historically, the term originates from the Greek \u2018choreia\u2019 (dance) to reflect dance-like movements.","pathophysiology":"Normal motor control requires balance between the direct (D1 receptor mediated) and indirect (D2 receptor mediated) basal ganglia pathways. In chorea, striatal neuronal loss or dysfunction reduces indirect pathway output, leading to excessive thalamic excitation of the cortex and involuntary movements. Dopaminergic hyperactivity or GABAergic inhibition loss contributes.","clinical_manifestation":"Chorea is characterized by abrupt, irregular, unpredictable movements affecting face, limbs, and trunk. They increase with stress or voluntary movement and diminish during sleep. Onset can be acute (e.g., Sydenham\u2019s) or insidious (e.g., Huntington\u2019s). Associated features may include hypotonia and difficulty with gait.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical; supportive testing includes MRI brain (to exclude structural lesions), genetic testing for Huntington\u2019s (CAG repeat analysis), rheumatologic markers for Sydenham\u2019s (ASO titer). EMG can differentiate chorea from myoclonus by irregular burst patterns.","management_principles":"First-line pharmacotherapy includes dopamine-depleting agents (tetrabenazine) and antipsychotics (risperidone) to reduce chorea severity (AAN guidelines, 2012). Dose titration guided by symptom control and side effect profile. Tetrabenazine carries risk of depression and parkinsonism.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor symptom severity using the Unified Chorea Rating Scale every 3\u20136 months. Screen for depression when on tetrabenazine. Adjust medications based on functional impairment. Genetic counseling for hereditary cases.","clinical_pearls":"1. Chorea movements are non-suppressible, unlike tics. 2. Sydenham\u2019s chorea often follows streptococcal infection by 4\u20136 weeks. 3. Tetrabenazine requires baseline depression screening. 4. MRI in chorea is usually normal unless secondary to structural lesion. 5. Chorea typically abates in sleep.","references":"1. Cardoso F et al. Classification of hyperkinetic movements.

It characteristically appears weeks to months after a group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Chorea-acanthocytosis presents in adulthood with orofacial dystonia and acanthocytes on peripheral smear. Wilson\u2019s disease has hepatic signs and Kayser-Fleischer rings. Essential tremor is an action tremor without chorea or gait instability.","conceptual_foundation":"Sydenham chorea is one of the major Jones criteria for rheumatic fever (ICD-11 RA13.0). It arises from autoimmune cross-reactivity between streptococcal antigens and basal ganglia structures. Differential includes metabolic, genetic, and neurodegenerative choreas. The classification of chorea has evolved to include autoimmune etiologies (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor, lupus) and paraneoplastic syndromes.","pathophysiology":"Molecular mimicry leads to anti-streptococcal antibodies (anti-N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosamine) that cross-react with basal ganglia neuronal tissue, particularly the caudate and putamen. Inflammation in the basal ganglia alters GABAergic and dopaminergic transmission, resulting in involuntary movements. Anti-neuronal antibodies deposit in small vessels in the striatum causing microglial activation.","clinical_manifestation":"Sydenham chorea presents with rapid, irregular, non-rhythmic involuntary movements of the limbs, face, and trunk. Onset is subacute, often bilateral but asymmetric. Hypotonia and emotional lability accompany chorea. Duration averages 2\u20134 months, but can persist up to 1 year.

Her father had the same history and died early. On examination, she was found to have orolingual dystonia.

Neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, including chorea-acanthocytosis, often present with orofacial dystonia, tongue protrusion, lip biting, self-mutilation, peripheral neuropathy, and elevated creatine kinase. A positive peripheral smear demonstrating acanthocytes confirms suspicion and directs further genetic testing of the VPS13A gene. Option B: Huntington\u2019s disease is characterized by generalized chorea, psychiatric disturbance, cognitive decline, and a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene. Although onset around the mid-thirties and autosomal dominant inheritance fit, early Huntington\u2019s rarely causes isolated orolingual dystonia severe enough to prevent feeding. In HD, ocular pursuit abnormalities and subtle executive dysfunction frequently precede dystonia. Thus, genetic testing for HD without specific HD features is lower yield. A negative blood film does not exclude HD, but detection of acanthocytes immediately narrows the differential. Therefore, performing a blood film to check for acanthocytes (Option A) is the most appropriate next diagnostic step.","Conceptual Foundation":"The basal ganglia play a key role in movement regulation through direct and indirect pathways modulating thalamocortical output. In chorea-acanthocytosis, degeneration primarily affects the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus. Loss of medium spiny GABAergic neurons in the indirect pathway leads to thalamic disinhibition and hyperkinetic movements. Orolingual dystonia arises from aberrant connectivity between the basal ganglia, brainstem, and supplementary motor area controlling oromotor musculature. Peripheral manifestations, including neuropathy and acanthocytosis, reflect systemic membrane protein defects. By contrast, Huntington\u2019s disease targets striatal neurons via polyglutamine aggregation, producing chorea and cognitive decline. Anatomical overlap can cause diagnostic confusion, but the predominance of dystonia and feeding impairment leans toward neuroacanthocytosis. Recognizing the interplay between subcortical nuclei, thalamus, and cortical output is essential for differentiating movement disorders. Subsequent genetic and laboratory evaluation should be guided by the predominant anatomical and clinical phenotype.","Pathophysiology":"Chorea-acanthocytosis results from loss-of-function mutations in the VPS13A gene encoding chorein, a protein involved in membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal integrity. Defective chorein disrupts erythrocyte membrane architecture, producing spiky acanthocytes, and impairs synaptic vesicle cycling in striatal neurons. Degeneration of GABAergic medium spiny neurons in the indirect pathway leads to reduced striatopallidal inhibition, thalamic overactivity, and hyperkinetic movements. Increased extracellular glutamate and altered dopamine receptor sensitivity further exacerbate excitotoxicity. Neuroinflammatory processes and microglial activation contribute to neuronal loss. Dysregulated calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction are also observed. By contrast, Huntington\u2019s disease involves polyglutamine expansions that produce toxic huntingtin aggregates, disrupting transcription, axonal transport, and mitochondrial function. In chorea-acanthocytosis, peripheral nerve involvement and elevated creatine kinase reflect systemic effects of chorein deficiency. Understanding these molecular and cellular mechanisms underpins targeted diagnostic testing and emerging therapies aiming to restore membrane trafficking or modulate neurotransmitter systems.","Clinical Manifestation":"Patients with chorea-acanthocytosis typically present in the third to fifth decade with progressive orofacial dystonia, trunk and limb chorea, dystonic posturing, and feeding difficulty due to tongue protrusion and jaw spasms. Excessive drooling, self-injury from tongue or lip biting, and dysarthria are classic. Peripheral neuropathy causes distal sensory loss and muscle weakness. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, including obsessive-compulsive behaviors, mood disorders, and cognitive slowing, may occur. Seizures are reported in up to 40% of cases. CK elevation and mild liver enzyme abnormalities reflect muscle involvement. In contrast, Huntington\u2019s disease often begins with subtle chorea, personality changes, and executive dysfunction before dystonia emerges. Prognosis in chorea-acanthocytosis is guarded, with progressive disability over one to two decades. Severity of orolingual dystonia correlates with nutrition compromise and aspiration risk. Early recognition of self-mutilation behaviors and neuropathy can differentiate from other hyperkinetic disorders. Variability in age of onset and symptom predominance underscores the need for targeted laboratory confirmation.","Diagnostic Approach":"The diagnostic algorithm begins with a comprehensive history and neurological examination, emphasizing family history, movement characterization, and systemic features. Initial laboratory testing should include a peripheral blood smear to detect acanthocytes and serum CK levels. If acanthocytes exceed 3\u20135%, proceed to genetic analysis of the VPS13A gene for chorein mutations. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies assess neuropathy. Brain MRI often shows caudate atrophy and increased T2 signal in the striatum. DAT-SPECT may reveal presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction. If acanthocytes are absent but clinical suspicion remains, consider lipid profiles, Wilson\u2019s disease studies, and autoimmune or paraneoplastic panels. Genetic testing for Huntington\u2019s disease (HTT CAG repeats) is reserved for patients with classic HD features. In ambiguous cases, muscle biopsy for chorein immunostaining can confirm loss of protein expression. Differential diagnosis includes Wilson disease, atypical parkinsonism, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, and drug-induced chorea. A structured algorithm ensures efficient, cost-effective diagnosis.","Management Principles":"Treatment is symptomatic and multidisciplinary. For chorea and dystonia, dopamine depleters such as tetrabenazine (initial dose 12.5 mg once daily, titrating to 50 mg/day in divided doses) or deutetrabenazine are first-line. Botulinum toxin injections into masseter, temporalis, and perioral muscles alleviate oromandibular dystonia and improve feeding. Anticholinergics (trihexyphenidyl 1 mg three times daily) may reduce dystonia. Antiepileptics such as valproate or levetiracetam control seizures. Physical and occupational therapy maintain mobility and functional independence. Nutritional support with feeding tubes may be necessary for severe dysphagia. Psychiatric symptoms respond to SSRIs or atypical antipsychotics (risperidone \u22642 mg/day) with caution regarding extrapyramidal side effects. Regular monitoring of mood, cognition, and QTc interval for tetrabenazine is critical. Investigational therapies targeting membrane trafficking or gene replacement are under study. Avoid dopamine antagonists, which can worsen dystonia. A tailored, patient-centered plan optimizes quality of life and mitigates complications.","Follow-up Guidelines":"Patients require multidisciplinary follow-up every three to six months. Monitor movement severity using validated scales (Unified Huntington\u2019s Disease Rating Scale adapted for acanthocytosis), CK levels, and nutritional status. Quarterly psychiatric evaluations detect depression, anxiety, or obsessive behaviors. Annual nerve conduction studies assess neuropathy progression. Periodic MRI evaluates striatal atrophy trajectory. Swallowing assessments guide timing for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy referral. Review medication efficacy and side effects at each visit, adjusting tetrabenazine or botulinum toxin dosing as needed. Provide genetic counseling for family planning and carrier testing of at-risk relatives. Educate patients on self-injury prevention and safe feeding practices. Long-term complications include aspiration pneumonia, contractures, and progressive cognitive decline. Encourage support group participation. Telemedicine visits can supplement in-person care for mobility-impaired patients. A structured follow-up plan reduces morbidity and facilitates timely intervention.","Clinical Pearls":"\u2022 Orofacial dystonia with tongue protrusion and lip-biting is highly specific for chorea-acanthocytosis in hyperkinetic syndromes.  \n\u2022 Acanthocytes on peripheral smear (>3\u20135%) provide a rapid, low-cost diagnostic clue prior to genetic testing.  \n\u2022 Chorea-acanthocytosis patients often exhibit elevated CK and peripheral neuropathy\u2014features uncommon in early Huntington\u2019s disease.  \n\u2022 Avoid dopamine receptor blockers; they worsen dystonia and parkinsonism.  \n\u2022 Botulinum toxin is highly effective for focal oromandibular dystonia and drooling.  \n\u2022 Always perform family counseling and discuss inheritance, even in presumed sporadic cases.  \n\u2022 Monitor mood and suicidality when using tetrabenazine.  \n\u2022 Recent guidelines recommend next-generation sequencing panels including VPS13A for atypical chorea.  \n\u2022 Consider muscle biopsy for chorein immunostaining when genetic results are inconclusive.  \n\u2022 Early recognition of feeding issues and timely gastrostomy improve quality of life.","References":"1.

In refractory essential tremor, DBS targets the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus. Multiple randomized and observational studies, including Benabid et al. (1991) and Deuschl et al. (2011), demonstrate a mean tremor reduction of 60\u201380% at one year with VIM DBS (Level A evidence per AAN 2018 guidelines). Option B (Hypothalamus) is incorrect, as hypothalamic stimulation has no established role in essential tremor. Option C (Globus pallidus interna) is primarily indicated for Parkinson\u2019s disease and dystonia rather than isolated essential tremor; GPi DBS yields only modest tremor control in essential tremor compared with thalamic targets.","conceptual_foundation":"Essential tremor is a high\u2010frequency, postural and kinetic action tremor affecting primarily the upper limbs. It is classified under ICD\u201011 8A00.0 and often follows an autosomal dominant inheritance. The VIM lies within the lateral thalamus and receives cerebellothalamic afferents from the dentate nucleus. Tremor generation involves a cerebello\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical loop; modulation of VIM output via high\u2010frequency stimulation disrupts this pathologic oscillatory activity. Historically, lesioning (thalamotomy) preceded DBS; the shift to reversible, adjustable DBS occurred in the 1990s.","pathophysiology":"In essential tremor, abnormal oscillatory activity arises from Purkinje cell loss and altered GABAergic inhibition in the cerebellar cortex, propagating through the dentato\u2010rubral\u2010thalamic pathway to motor cortex. VIM DBS at 130\u2013185 Hz induces depolarization block, enhances GABA release, and modulates firing patterns to suppress tremor. This contrasts with GPi DBS, which primarily affects pallido\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical motor circuits relevant to bradykinesia and rigidity in Parkinson\u2019s disease.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with bilateral, symmetric postural and kinetic tremor of the hands, head, or voice, often improving with alcohol.

First\u2010tier workup includes history, physical exam, thyroid function tests, and basic metabolic panel (to exclude metabolic tremors). Second\u2010tier investigations (e.g., neuroimaging) rule out structural lesions if atypical features are present. No imaging biomarker is required for DBS candidacy, but MRI is obtained to exclude lesions and to plan stereotactic targeting.","management_principles":"Medical management begins with propranolol (80\u2013320 mg/day) and primidone (75\u2013450 mg/day). Refractory cases may receive topiramate or gabapentin (Level B evidence). VIM DBS is recommended for severe, medication\u2010refractory tremor (Class I, Level A per AAN 2018), achieving sustained tremor control in >70% of patients at 5 years.
