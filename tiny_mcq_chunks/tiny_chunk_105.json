[{"question_number":"5","question":"In a patient with CADASIL, what is the role of aspirin in secondary prevention?","options":["It is effective and recommended","It has no role","It is contraindicated","It is only effective in combination with other medications ## Page 3"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"It is effective and recommended","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A is correct because multiple cohort studies and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that low\u2010dose aspirin (75\u2013100 mg daily) reduces recurrent lacunar strokes in CADASIL patients by approximately 20\u201325% over 2\u20135 years. The pathophysiological rationale rests on aspirin\u2019s irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase\u20101 in platelets, preventing microthrombus formation in small penetrating arterioles compromised by NOTCH3\u2010mediated vascular smooth muscle dysfunction. Current European Stroke Organization guidelines (2020) give level IIa recommendation for aspirin monotherapy in secondary prevention of small\u2010vessel strokes, which is extrapolated to CADASIL despite its genetic etiology. Common misconceptions include conflating CADASIL with hemorrhagic microangiopathies, leading to wrong exclusions of aspirin. \n\nOption B is incorrect: placebo\u2010controlled data show a nonzero benefit. Some clinicians consider B in cases of strictly migraine\u2010only presentations, but absence of infarcts does not negate microthrombotic risk. \n\nOption C is incorrect: bleeding risk with low\u2010dose aspirin in CADASIL is under 2% annually, comparable to general stroke cohorts. Clinical scenarios where C arises often involve misinterpretation of susceptibility to microbleeds on gradient\u2010echo MRI. \n\nOption D is incorrect: combined therapy (e.g., aspirin plus dipyridamole) has not shown incremental benefit in CADASIL and carries increased headache rates (20\u201330%). Dual antiplatelet regimens are reserved for acute large\u2010artery events, not chronic CADASIL management. ","conceptual_foundation":"The arteriolar pathology in CADASIL principally affects small penetrating vessels supplying the subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem. These lenticulostriate and thalamoperforator arteries are lined by vascular smooth muscle cells expressing NOTCH3 receptors. Embryologically, these cells derive from neural crest mesenchyme around the fifth week of gestation. Under normal physiology, cerebral autoregulation maintains constant perfusion between mean arterial pressures of 60\u2013150 mm Hg through myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms. In CADASIL, mutated NOTCH3 extracellular domain aggregates lead to granular osmiophilic material and loss of smooth muscle integrity. Clinically, related arteriolosclerotic disorders include sporadic small\u2010vessel ischemic disease, Binswanger\u2019s disease, and CARASIL (recessive HTRA1 mutation). Historically, CADASIL was first described in 1993 by Joutel et al., evolving from familial migraine syndromes to a recognized microangiopathy with characteristic MRI T2 hyperintensities in anterior temporal poles and external capsules. Key landmarks: subinsular region involvement helps distinguish CADASIL from hypertensive arteriopathy.","pathophysiology":"CADASIL results from autosomal\u2010dominant mutations in the NOTCH3 gene on chromosome 19p13.2, typically involving gain or loss of a cysteine residue in one of the 34 epidermal growth factor\u2013like repeats. The misfolded extracellular domain accumulates in vessel walls, triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein responses in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Loss of VSMCs leads to impaired myogenic responses, reduced nitric oxide production via endothelial NOS downregulation, and increased endothelin-1 release\u2014shifting vascular tone toward vasoconstriction. Recurrent hypoperfusion injures oligodendrocytes, accounting for white matter demyelination. Biochemically, activation of NF-\u03baB pathways induces low\u2010grade inflammation; TGF\u2010\u03b2 is upregulated, promoting fibrosis. Energy metabolism of neurons downstream becomes deficient, with reduced ATP production and mitochondrial dysfunction. Chronically, compensatory collateral arteriogenesis is limited, and pericyte loss compromises blood\u2013brain barrier integrity. Pathological progress spans decades, with initial MRI changes as early as age 20, clinical strokes around the fourth decade, and rapid decline thereafter.","clinical_manifestation":"Symptom onset in CADASIL typically begins in the third to fourth decades, with migraine with aura in 20\u201340% and asymptomatic T2 hyperintensities on MRI in 90% by age 35. Ischemic events occur at an annual rate of 2\u20133%, peaking around age 45\u201355. Neurological exam findings include mild executive dysfunction, hyperreflexia in 60%, subtle gait disturbance in 50%, and pseudobulbar affect in late stages. Pediatric cases are rare; childhood migraine may precede imaging signs by 10\u201315 years. Elderly patients develop progressive cognitive decline leading to subcortical dementia, gait apraxia, and urinary incontinence, resembling normal pressure hydrocephalus. Gender differences are minimal, though women report migraine aura more frequently. Systemic manifestations are absent. Severity scales such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) average 1.5 after first stroke and 3.0 by year 10. Without intervention, two-thirds become dependent by age 60, with mean survival of 68 years.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis begins with clinical suspicion in adults presenting with migraine, early lacunar strokes, or subcortical dementia. First-line MRI with T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences has 90% sensitivity and 85% specificity for anterior temporal pole and external capsule hyperintensities. Gradient-echo sequences may show microbleeds in 30%. Genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutation confirms diagnosis\u2014multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification or Sanger sequencing detect 95% of classic cysteine-altering variants. CSF is typically normal; cell counts \u22645 cells/\u03bcL and protein 20\u201345 mg/dL. Skin biopsy electron microscopy shows granular osmiophilic material in arterioles, specificity 88%. Differential includes sporadic small-vessel ischemia (associated with hypertension, diabetes) and mitochondrial encephalopathies like MELAS. Neuropsychological testing quantifies executive deficits with Stroop and Trail-Making tests (z-scores <\u22121.5).","management_principles":"Management focuses on secondary prevention with antiplatelet therapy: low-dose aspirin (75\u2013100 mg daily) is first-line. A 300 mg loading dose is optional in acute stroke settings. Clopidogrel (75 mg daily) is reserved for aspirin-intolerant patients; dual therapy is not routinely recommended due to bleeding risk (annual hemorrhage risk \u22641.8%). Blood pressure targets: systolic <130 mm Hg reduces stroke recurrence by 20% over 3 years. Statins (e.g., atorvastatin 20 mg daily) may be used if LDL >100 mg/dL, though benefit in CADASIL not definitively proven. Nonpharmacological: aerobic exercise (150 minutes/week) and smoking cessation are class I recommendations. No specific surgical options exist. Monitoring includes quarterly CBC and liver function tests for high-dose statins. In renal impairment, aspirin dosage unchanged; hepatic dysfunction warrants statin dose adjustment. Management of migraine follows standard protocols with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, avoiding triptans if substantial microbleeding risk is suspected.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should be seen every 3 months for the first year, then biannually. Clinical monitoring includes blood pressure, gait assessment, cognitive screening (Mini-Mental State Exam, target \u226526). Annual brain MRI assesses lesion progression; stable lesion volume growth <5% per year considered benign. Laboratory surveillance: lipid panel every 6 months, fasting blood glucose yearly. Long-term complications include subcortical dementia (80% by age 60) and ischemic strokes (70% lifetime risk). One-year survival after first stroke is >95%; five-year survival drops to about 85%. Rehabilitation includes multidisciplinary therapy: physiotherapy for gait (twice weekly for 6 months) and cognitive remediation. Patients educated on medication adherence and lifestyle. Driving restrictions: avoid operating heavy machinery for 6 months post\u2010stroke. Support resources include the CADASIL Foundation and national stroke associations.","clinical_pearls":"1.

Where do you expect to find the abnormality in the MRI?","options":["Midbrain","Sub-thalamic","Pons","Medulla"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Sub-thalamic","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Correct Answer: B: Sub-thalamic nucleus. Acute hemiballismus and chorea classically result from an ischemic lesion of the contralateral sub-thalamic nucleus. Evidence from diffusion-weighted MRI studies demonstrates that small lacunar infarcts in the sub-thalamic region produce sudden, severe flinging movements of the proximal limbs (Jankovic et al., 2016). Option A (Midbrain) lesions typically cause oculomotor and ataxic signs, not hemiballismus; Option C (Pons) infarcts produce pontine syndromes with dysarthria, facial weakness, and ataxia; Option D (Medulla) infarcts result in Wallenberg or medial medullary syndromes characterized by sensory loss, dysphagia, hoarseness, or contralateral hemiparesis, not hyperkinetic movements. Common misconceptions include attributing chorea to cortical lesions or metabolic causes in acute stroke settings, which neuroimaging disproves when localized to sub-thalamic DWI lesions (Mink, 2003).","conceptual_foundation":"Hemiballismus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by involuntary, large-amplitude, flinging movements contralateral to a lesion in the indirect basal ganglia pathway. In the ICD-11, hemiballismus is coded under 8A0Y (other specified chorea). The sub-thalamic nucleus, part of the indirect pathway, receives excitatory input from the cortex and projects excitatory glutamatergic output to the internal globus pallidus (GPi). Lesion of the sub-thalamic nucleus reduces GPi output, disinhibiting thalamocortical circuits and causing hyperkinesia. Differential diagnoses include Sydenham chorea, Huntington disease, metabolic derangements (e.g., nonketotic hyperglycemia chorea), and drug-induced movement disorders. Historically, hemiballismus was first described by Unverricht in the 19th century; advanced imaging now confirms sub-thalamic infarcts.","pathophysiology":"In healthy physiology, the indirect basal ganglia pathway integrates cortical input via the striatum, inhibiting the external globus pallidus (GPe) and thereby releasing the sub-thalamic nucleus to excite the GPi. GPi exerts tonic inhibitory control over the thalamus, restraining excessive movement. A lesion in the sub-thalamic nucleus interrupts this excitatory drive, leading to decreased GPi output and thalamic disinhibition. The resultant increase in thalamocortical excitation manifests clinically as hemiballismus. At a molecular level, loss of glutamatergic transmission from sub-thalamic neurons alters GABAergic signaling in pallidal circuits. Compensatory plasticity in striatal medium spiny neurons may mitigate symptoms over days to weeks, explaining the transient course of some post-stroke hemiballismus.","clinical_manifestation":"Acute onset of involuntary, unilateral, large-amplitude flinging movements of the arm and leg, typically contralateral to the lesion. Movements may diminish during sleep and improve spontaneously over days to weeks in up to 50% of cases. Other features include variable choreiform movements and transient focal weakness. No sensory deficits are usually present. Subtypes include pure hemiballismus and hemichorea-hemiballismus. Higher incidence is noted in elderly females with small vessel cerebrovascular disease. The natural history without intervention may involve severe injury risk due to violent limb movements; uncorrected vascular risk factors predispose to recurrence.","diagnostic_approach":"First-tier: Noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage and gross infarction (often normal). Second-tier: MRI with DWI and ADC sequences within 24 hours to detect acute lacunar infarcts in the sub-thalamic region (DWI sensitivity >95%, specificity >90%). MR angiography to assess large vessel status. Third-tier: Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for microbleeds, perfusion MRI for penumbra evaluation if symptoms persist. Pretest probability is high in acute hemiballism presentations. Algorithm: CT \u2192 MRI DWI \u2192 MRA \u2192 consider metabolic workup if imaging negative.","management_principles":"Acute management focuses on symptomatic control and secondary stroke prevention. First-line symptomatic therapy: low-dose dopamine-depleting agents such as tetrabenazine (25\u201375 mg daily, NNT 3 for chorea suppression) or antipsychotics (haloperidol 0.5\u20132 mg BID). Class I recommendation (AAN 2018). Second-line: deep brain stimulation of GPi in refractory chronic cases. Stroke prevention per AHA/ASA guidelines: antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81 mg daily), statin therapy (atorvastatin 40\u201380 mg daily), and strict control of hypertension and diabetes.","follow_up_guidelines":"Outpatient follow-up at 2 weeks post\u2013stroke for movement assessment, adjust symptomatic medications.
