[{"question_number":"4","question":"A patient with renal failure missed one dialysis session. What would you expect to see on electroencephalogram (EEG)?","options":["Generalized slowing","Triphasic waves","Epileptiform discharges"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Triphasic waves","subspecialty":"Critical Care Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"In uremic encephalopathy resulting from missed dialysis, the characteristic EEG pattern is generalized triphasic waves. These waveforms consist of high-amplitude, generalized, positive-negative-positive complexes with a frontal predominance, typically occurring at 1.5\u20132.5 Hz. While generalized slowing (option A) can be seen in a variety of metabolic encephalopathies, it is nonspecific. Epileptiform discharges (option C) are not a feature of pure metabolic encephalopathy such as uremia unless there is an underlying seizure predisposition.","conceptual_foundation":"Uremic encephalopathy arises when retained nitrogenous waste products (e.g., urea, creatinine, guanidine compounds) cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and disrupt neuronal function. EEG triphasic waves reflect widespread cortical and subcortical dysfunction, particularly involving the frontal lobes and thalamocortical circuits. Uremic toxins alter GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, leading to characteristic EEG changes.","pathophysiology":"Normal neuronal function depends on maintenance of ionic gradients and neurotransmitter homeostasis. In uremia, neurotoxins accumulate, impair astrocytic regulation of extracellular potassium and glutamate, and produce neuronal membrane instability. This leads to synchronous cortical oscillations manifesting as triphasic waves. The frontal predominance is related to the high metabolic demand and vulnerability of frontal cortical neurons.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with uremic encephalopathy present with progressive confusion, lethargy, myoclonus, and sometimes asterixis. Triphasic waves on EEG are seen in up to 50\u201370% of patients with moderate to severe uremic encephalopathy and correlate with symptom severity. With dialysis, both clinical and EEG abnormalities resolve.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, supported by elevated BUN/creatinine and EEG findings. First-line tests include basic metabolic panel and EEG. Triphasic waves have a sensitivity of ~60% and specificity of ~80% for metabolic encephalopathy. Neuroimaging is typically normal or shows diffuse cerebral edema.","management_principles":"The definitive treatment is prompt hemodialysis to remove uremic toxins. Supportive measures include ensuring airway protection and preventing complications of encephalopathy. EEG monitoring can guide treatment efficacy; resolution of triphasic waves parallels clinical improvement.","follow_up_guidelines":"After dialysis, repeat EEG within 24\u201348 hours to confirm resolution of triphasic waves. Monitor renal function and neurological status regularly. Adjust dialysis frequency to prevent recurrence.","clinical_pearls":"Triphasic waves are highly suggestive of metabolic encephalopathy, especially uremia. They should prompt evaluation for treatable causes. Resolution with dialysis confirms the diagnosis. Do not confuse with periodic epileptiform discharges seen in CJD. Always correlate EEG with clinical context.","references":"Missing references information"},"ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2019","exam_type":"Part One","source_file":"Part II 2019_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Critical Care Neurology","import_source":"critical_care_neurology_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"6","question":"When should a patient with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome be admitted to the ICU?","options":["Rapid progression of weakness","Severe autonomic or swallowing dysfunction","Evolving respiratory distress","All of the above"],"correct_answer":"D","correct_answer_text":"All of the above","subspecialty":"Critical Care Neurology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is D: All of the above. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is indicated when patients exhibit rapid progression of weakness (risk of respiratory failure), severe autonomic dysfunction (arrhythmias, labile blood pressure), swallowing impairment with risk of aspiration, or evolving respiratory distress demonstrated by declining vital capacity. Option A (Rapid progression of weakness) predicts impending ventilatory failure. Option B (Severe autonomic or swallowing dysfunction) carries high risk of life-threatening arrhythmias and aspiration pneumonia. Option C (Evolving respiratory distress) mandates close monitoring and potential mechanical ventilation.","conceptual_foundation":"In GBS management, critical care principles intersect with neuromuscular pathophysiology. Admission criteria derive from natural history data showing that approximately 20\u201330% of patients require mechanical ventilation. Autonomic dysfunction occurs in up to 65% and can precipitate sudden cardiovascular collapse. ICU care provides close respiratory monitoring, hemodynamic stabilization, and timely intervention. This approach is grounded in practice parameters from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS).","pathophysiology":"Rapid demyelination of nerve roots and peripheral nerves can involve respiratory motor neurons (phrenic and intercostal nerves), leading to diaphragmatic weakness and hypoventilation. Concurrent dysregulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow results in blood pressure lability, tachyarrhythmias, or bradyarrhythmias. Bulbar nerve involvement impairs swallowing and cough reflex, increasing aspiration risk. The cumulative effect can lead to respiratory arrest and cardiovascular instability.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients admitted to ICU with GBS often present with shallow breathing, orthopnea, use of accessory muscles, or paradoxical breathing. Autonomic signs include fluctuating blood pressure, sinus tachycardia, or bradycardia. Bulbar involvement manifests as dysphagia and inability to manage secretions. Monitoring frequency of vital capacity drops correlates with respiratory muscle weakness progression. Early signs of autonomic crisis include profuse sweating and urinary retention.","diagnostic_approach":"ICU admission is based on clinical predictors: vital capacity \u226420 mL/kg, negative inspiratory force \u2264\u221230 cm H\u2082O, presence of bulbar weakness, and rapid progression (>1 grade decline on the Medical Research Council scale over 24 hours). Continuous respiratory monitoring (capnography, ABGs) and cardiac telemetry are instituted. Arterial lines facilitate hemodynamic management during autonomic storms.","management_principles":"In the ICU, support includes noninvasive ventilation trial if appropriate, escalating to invasive mechanical ventilation for failing respiratory parameters. Autonomic instability is managed with IV fluids, vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine for hypotension), and short-acting beta-blockers for tachyarrhythmias. Aspiration risk mandates early gastrostomy or nasogastric tube placement. Prophylactic heparin or pneumatic compression devices prevent deep vein thrombosis.","follow_up_guidelines":"After stabilization, patients are transferred to step-down units when respiratory function and hemodynamics are stable for at least 24 hours. Serial neurophysiological studies guide recovery tracking. Multidisciplinary rounds including neurology, critical care, rehabilitation, and nutrition ensure coordinated care. Patient education on warning signs precedes ward transfer.","clinical_pearls":"1. A drop in vital capacity by >30% from baseline is a red flag for intubation. 2. Autonomic storms can cause sudden bradycardia and cardiac arrest; continuous monitoring is essential. 3. Early involvement of respiratory therapists improves ventilator weaning success. 4. Bulbar dysfunction often precedes respiratory failure. 5. Prophylactic DVT measures reduce thromboembolic complications in immobilized patients.","references":"1.

Traumatic hemorrhage results from mechanical forces\u2014acceleration, deceleration, or direct impact\u2014causing blood vessel disruption. Approximately 20\u201330% of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) admissions show intracranial bleeding, including epidural (10\u201320%) and subdural hematomas (40\u201350%). Per Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines (2016), surgical evacuation when volume exceeds 30 mL or midline shift exceeds 5 mm reduces mortality by 25%. Common misconceptions include attributing irregular, mixed-density bleeds to primary hypertension instead of contusion-induced vessel shearing. Diffuse axonal injury may coexist but lacks the mass effect typical of traumatic hemorrhage.\n\nOption B (Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage\u2014ICH): Incorrect. Primary ICH arises from spontaneous vessel rupture due to hypertension or amyloid angiopathy, often in basal ganglia or thalamus. ICH accounts for 10\u201315% of strokes, peak incidence at age 60\u201370. CT typically reveals homogeneous parenchymal bleed without skull fracture. In contrast, our case shows irregular extra-axial collection and bone discontinuity, hallmark of trauma.\n\nOption C (Lobar hemorrhage): Incorrect. Lobar hemorrhages involve cortical-subcortical junction, associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy in elderly. They present as round collections in parietal or occipital lobes, not crossing suture lines. Unlike traumatic bleeds, lobar hemorrhage lacks fracture lines, and nearly 75% of CAA bleeds recur within two years.\n\nOption D (Subarachnoid hemorrhage): Incorrect. Nontraumatic SAH, often from ruptured berry aneurysm (80\u201385%), generates hyperdense blood in cisterns and sulci on CT. Classic presentation includes sudden \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache. Mortality at 1 month approaches 50%. Traumatic SAH appears as thin sulcal blood but not as a focal mass lesion as seen here.\n\nIn summary, irregular clot contour, mixed densities on CT, concomitant skull fractures, and acute loss of consciousness definitively indicate traumatic hemorrhage. Robust data from multicenter TBI trials confirm surgical benefit when guided by these imaging and clinical criteria.","conceptual_foundation":"The anatomical basis of traumatic hemorrhage involves the dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater layers covering the cerebral cortex. Key regions include the convexities overlying the frontal and temporal lobes where bridging veins traverse subdural space. Trauma causes shear stress on these vessels between fixed dura and mobile brain. Embryologically, meninges derive from mesenchyme around the neural tube; vascularization begins at week five, establishing pial vessels susceptible to shear injury. Normally, intracranial pressure (ICP) is regulated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production (0.3 mL/min) and cerebral blood flow autoregulation between 50\u2013150 mm Hg arterial pressure. Related conditions include epidural hematoma from middle meningeal artery laceration and diffuse axonal injury affecting white matter tracts such as corpus callosum. Historical milestones include Dandy\u2019s 1920 description of subdural hematoma and Cushing\u2019s early ICP monitoring in 1901. Key landmarks: the pterion indicating high epidural risk, the sagittal sinus vulnerability medially, and temporal tips prone to contusion against bony ridges. Clinical significance lies in rapid identification of mass effect and potential herniation syndromes\u2014uncal herniation compresses third cranial nerve, leading to fixed dilated pupil. Understanding these structures underpins accurate diagnosis, timely intervention, and improved outcomes.","pathophysiology":"Traumatic hemorrhage results from mechanical disruption of blood vessels leading to blood extravasation into cranial compartments. At the molecular level, shear forces activate endothelial mechanoreceptors, triggering calcium influx through voltage-gated channels. Excess intracellular calcium promotes nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species generation, causing lipid peroxidation and blood-brain barrier breakdown within 30 minutes post-injury. Concurrently, glutamate release from injured neurons overstimulates NMDA receptors, sustaining excitotoxic cascades. Genetic polymorphisms in APOE \u03b54 allele correlate with poorer outcomes, affecting cytoskeletal resilience. Inflammatory mediators\u2014IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MMP-9\u2014peak at six hours, recruiting microglia and neutrophils that release proteases and free radicals, exacerbating edema. Energy failure arises as mitochondrial dysfunction impairs ATP synthesis, increasing lactate and ionic dysregulation. The time course evolves: hyperacute hemorrhage (<\u20091 hour), acute inflammation (1\u201324 hours), subacute gliosis (days 2\u20137), and chronic resolution (weeks). Compensatory cerebrovascular dilation preserves perfusion but elevates intracranial pressure, eventually exhausting autoregulatory capacity, risking ischemia. Understanding these cascades informs timing of medical interventions\u2014hyperosmolar therapy within first four hours and anti-inflammatory strategies targeting cytokine peaks.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with immediate loss of consciousness in 20\u201330% of moderate to severe TBI, followed by transient lucidity in approximately 15%, then rapid neurological decline within minutes to hours. Symptom onset peaks at 1\u20132 hours post-injury. Examination reveals altered Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores: moderate (9\u201312) in 35%, severe (\u2264\u20098) in 25%. Focal findings include contralateral hemiparesis in 60% when mass effect compresses internal capsule, ipsilateral pupil dilation in 45% due to uncal herniation, and decerebrate posturing in 30%. In pediatric patients, bulging fontanelle and lethargy predominate; elderly may exhibit confusion and vomiting with only mild headache initially. Females exhibit 10\u201315% lower intracranial compliance, potentially faster progression. Systemic signs include hypertension (Cushing response), bradycardia, and irregular respiration. Severity scales: Marshall CT classification correlates with six-month mortality of 10\u201390%, depending on lesion volume (>\u200925 mL predicts 50% mortality). Red flags include rapid neurological deterioration, anisocoria >\u20091 mm, and refractory intracranial hypertension. Without prompt treatment, natural history leads to transtentorial herniation and brainstem compression within 48 hours in severe cases.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial assessment follows ABCs with airway protection and cervical spine immobilization. Noncontrast head CT is first-line: sensitivity 95%, specificity 90% for acute hemorrhage, showing hyperdense collections. Decision algorithm: GCS \u2264\u20098 or focal deficits mandates immediate CT. If CT equivocal and suspicion persists, MRI with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) at 3T identifies microhemorrhages. Laboratory workup includes coagulation panel (PT 11\u201315 sec, aPTT 25\u201340 sec, INR < 1.2) and platelet count (150\u2013400 \u00d710^9/L). If anticoagulated, perform thromboelastography. Intracranial pressure monitoring indicated if abnormal CT plus GCS \u2264\u20098. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in mass lesions. Electrophysiology: transcranial Doppler shows elevated pulsatility index >\u20091.5, indicating raised ICP. Differential diagnoses: spontaneous hemorrhagic stroke shows midline deep bleeds without skull fracture; tumor hemorrhage often has irregular enhancing margins on contrast CT. Distinguishing features include fracture lines, mixed densities from ongoing bleeding, and concomitant soft tissue scalp injury. Continuous neurocritical monitoring guides repeat imaging every 6\u20138 hours if deterioration occurs.","management_principles":"First-line therapy aims to reduce intracranial pressure and prevent secondary injury. Administer hyperosmolar therapy: mannitol 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV bolus over 15 minutes, repeated every 4\u20136 hours, targeting serum osmolality 300\u2013320 mOsm/kg. Alternative: 3% hypertonic saline at 2\u20135 mL/kg bolus followed by 0.1\u20131 mL/kg/h infusion, maintaining sodium 145\u2013155 mEq/L. Seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam 20 mg/kg load then 1 000 mg IV every 12 hours for seven days. Sedation with propofol 0.5\u20134 mg/kg/h to achieve Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale of \u20132 to \u20133. Correct coagulopathy: prothrombin complex concentrate for warfarin reversal (25\u201350 IU/kg), platelet transfusion if count <\u2009100 \u00d710^9/L. Surgical indications: hematoma volume >\u200930 mL or midline shift >\u20095 mm. Craniotomy yields functional recovery in 40\u201360% of eligible patients. Avoid hypotonic fluids. Monitor ICP via parenchymal probe, targeting <\u200920 mm Hg; maintain cerebral perfusion pressure 60\u201370 mm Hg. In pregnancy, avoid mannitol; use hypertonic saline under fetal monitoring. Adjust dosage in renal impairment by reviewing osmolality and fluid status.","follow_up_guidelines":"After acute stabilization, schedule neurological assessments daily for first week, then every 1\u20132 weeks until discharge. Repeat noncontrast head CT at 24 hours post-operation and at one month, or earlier if clinical deterioration occurs. Monitor serum electrolytes (normal sodium 135\u2013145 mEq/L) and osmolality weekly. Long-term complications include post-traumatic epilepsy in 10\u201325% of cases and hydrocephalus in 5\u201315%. One-year functional independence (Glasgow Outcome Scale 4\u20135) is achieved in approximately 60%. Coordinate outpatient rehabilitation, starting occupational and physical therapy within two weeks, cognitive therapy by one month. Educate patients on symptoms of shunt dysfunction: headache, nausea. Advise no driving for at least three months; neuropsychological testing required before clearance. Provide resources: Brain Injury Association and local head injury support groups. Plan follow-up neuroimaging at six months to assess gliosis and shunt patency.","clinical_pearls":"1. Suspect traumatic hemorrhage when CT shows mixed densities and skull fracture. 2.

Bilateral absence of the cortical N20 somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) recorded 24 hours after cardiac arrest has a false-positive rate close to 0% for predicting poor outcome, as endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology guidelines. No other options were provided, but complementary markers such as absent pupillary reflexes or status myoclonus also contribute to multimodal prognostication.","conceptual_foundation":"Prognostication after anoxic brain injury relies on clinical examination, electrophysiological studies, neuroimaging, and biomarkers. SSEPs measure the integrity of the somatosensory pathway from median nerve stimulation to cortical response (N20). The presence of N20 indicates preserved cortical function, whereas its bilateral absence indicates severe cortical injury. Current classification systems for anoxic encephalopathy (ICD-11) include electrophysiological markers as part of diagnosis. Historical use of SSEP in prognostication dates back to the 1980s, with refinement through hypothermia protocols. Embryologically, the somatosensory cortex derives from the dorsal telencephalon, with somatosensory pathways developing from the neural tube. Blood supply is via anterior and middle cerebral arteries, making it vulnerable to hypoperfusion.","pathophysiology":"Normal SSEPs reflect intact peripheral nerves, dorsal columns, brainstem, thalamus, and primary sensory cortex. After cardiac arrest, global ischemia triggers neuronal depolarization, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis, particularly in the cortex and hippocampus. Absent N20 implies loss of cortical synaptic function due to widespread neuronal death. Molecularly, ischemia disrupts ion gradients, increases intracellular calcium, activates proteases, and leads to inflammatory cascades. The temporal evolution includes early cytotoxic edema followed by delayed secondary injury. Loss of SSEPs correlates with histological necrosis and gliosis in sensorimotor cortex.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients with absent N20 24 hours post-arrest typically lack brainstem reflexes, have poor motor responses (extensor posturing or worse), and may show status myoclonus. The natural history without intervention is progression to coma and eventual brain death. In treated hypothermia protocols, SSEP remains reliable after rewarming at 24\u201372 hours. Sensitivity of bilateral absent N20 for predicting poor outcome is approximately 0.46 and specificity approaches 1.00, which supports its prognostic value.","diagnostic_approach":"SSEPs are acquired with median nerve stimulation at the wrist, recording at Erb\u2019s point and scalp (C3'/C4'). Guidelines recommend testing at least 24 hours post-resuscitation and at least 72 hours post-rewarming if therapeutic hypothermia is used. Sensitivity is approximately 50% and specificity 100%. Additional modalities include EEG, MRI DWI, and clinical examination. A tiered approach includes first-tier exam and EEG, second-tier SSEP, and third-tier biomarkers like neuron-specific enolase. In resource-limited settings, focus on clinical and EEG markers.","management_principles":"There is no therapeutic intervention to reverse established cortical injury. Management focuses on supportive care and decision-making about withdrawal of care. Multimodal prognostication uses SSEPs, EEG patterns such as suppression-burst, MRI, and biomarkers. No pharmacologic agents have been shown to improve outcome at this stage. Ethical frameworks guide discussions with families, emphasizing the near-certain poor prognosis indicated by absent N20.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up includes serial neurological exams, EEG at 48\u201372 hours, and neuroimaging to detect early structural changes.
