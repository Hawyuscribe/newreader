Later, she develops paraplegia, numbness, and sphincter dysfunction. ANA is positive, AQP-4 antibody is negative, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows negative OCB. MRI reveals increased signal from T6 to T10. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Progressive MS","NMOSD ## Page 14"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"NMOSD","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: NMOSD. The patient\u2019s bilateral optic neuritis followed by longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (T6\u2013T10) in the setting of negative AQP4 and OCB but positive ANA meets the 2015 IPND criteria for seronegative NMOSD. Progressive MS (A) is incorrect because MS lesions are typically periventricular and short-segment spinal, and OCB positivity is common.","conceptual_foundation":"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is an astrocytopathy mediated by antibodies targeting aquaporin-4 or, in seronegative cases, presumed MOG or other antigens. It is classified separately from MS under ICD-11 code 8A40. Differential includes MS, MOGAD, and sarcoidosis. The nosology evolved from NMO to NMOSD in 2015 to include seronegative cases with typical phenotypes.","pathophysiology":"In AQP4-positive NMOSD, pathogenic IgG binds aquaporin-4 on astrocyte endfeet, triggering complement activation, astrocyte injury, and secondary demyelination. In seronegative cases, MOG antibodies may act similarly. The extensive spinal cord lesions reflect astrocyte loss and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption over multiple vertebral segments.","clinical_manifestation":"Cardinal features include optic neuritis (often bilateral), longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, area postrema syndrome, and brainstem symptoms. Seronegative patients often have similar presentations. Onset is typically acute with severe visual loss and motor deficits, often disabling without prompt immunotherapy.","diagnostic_approach":"2015 IPND diagnostic criteria require 1 core clinical characteristic and AQP4-IgG positivity or, if negative, at least two core characteristics including one optic neuritis or longitudinally extensive myelitis. Spinal MRI showing \u22653 contiguous vertebral segments (sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~90%) is key. CSF OCB are usually negative in NMOSD (<20%).","management_principles":"Acute attacks: high-dose IV methylprednisolone \u00b1 PLEX improves recovery (Class II evidence). Preventive therapy: eculizumab (PREVENT trial, HR 0.06), inebilizumab, or satralizumab are approved for AQP4-positive NMOSD. Seronegative management parallels AQP4-positive, though rituximab is often used off-label.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor clinical status every 3\u20136 months, repeat MRI annually, assess relapse activity. Track B cell counts if on rituximab. Counseling for early attack recognition. Long-term disability and relapse prevention are goals.","clinical_pearls":"1. Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (>3 segments) is highly specific for NMOSD. 2. AQP4 negativity does not exclude NMOSD if clinical/MRI criteria met. 3.

Approximately 10\u201315% of generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) patients harbor a thymic epithelial tumor. Studies show 30\u201345% of thymoma cases coincide with MG, and 60\u201380% of MG patients have thymic abnormalities on imaging. Pathophysiologically, thymomas mispresent acetylcholine receptor epitopes, breaking central tolerance. Misconceptions include equating thymic hyperplasia with tumor formation; hyperplasia occurs in 65\u201375% of MG without malignancy. A 2017 meta\u2010analysis (n=1,200) confirmed thymoma association increases relapse risk but does not worsen survival under modern therapies.\n\nOption B (Bad prognosis): Incorrect. Historical cohorts cited 30% mortality in untreated generalized MG. Contemporary series report 2\u20133% mortality at 5 years with immunotherapy. Thymoma\u2010associated MG responds well to combined thymectomy and steroids. A 2019 registry (n=832) reported 5\u2010year remission in 55% with thymoma and 60% without, p=0.32.\n\nOption C (No response to steroids): Incorrect. Both thymomatous and nonthymomatous MG show 60\u201380% improvement within 4\u20138 weeks of high\u2010dose corticosteroids (1\u20131.5 mg/kg/day). Roughly 70% of thymoma patients achieve >50% quantitative MG score (QMG) improvement by 3 months. Failure suggests refractory disease or misdiagnosis.\n\nOption D (Associated only with hyperplasia): Incorrect. Although 65\u201375% of early\u2010onset MG patients have thymic hyperplasia, the distinct entity of thymoma underlies 10\u201315%. Confusing hyperplasia with thymoma leads to choice D. In clinical practice, CT chest differentiates these lesions in >95% of cases.","conceptual_foundation":"The thymus resides in the anterior superior mediastinum, spanning from the lower pole of the thyroid to the level of the fourth costal cartilage. It comprises two lobes containing epithelial cells, developing from the third pharyngeal pouch around week six of gestation. Thymic cortical epithelial cells present self\u2010peptides via MHC class II, educating T cells to ignore self\u2010antigens, including acetylcholine receptors (AChR) subunits (alpha, beta, gamma). Failure of this central tolerance leads to autoreactive CD4+ T\u2010cell export and B\u2010cell class switching in germinal centers, producing pathogenic anti\u2010AChR IgG1 and IgG3.\n\nIn normal neuromuscular junctions, ACh released from presynaptic terminals binds postsynaptic nicotinic receptors, generating endplate potentials. Related syndromes include Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome at the presynaptic P/Q calcium channel and congenital myasthenic syndromes involving receptor mutations. Historically, Erb (1879) first described fatigable weakness; Walker and Goodpasture later correlated thymic pathology in the 1930s. Key landmarks such as the sternal notch and manubrium guide thymectomy, critical for removing thymoma tissue to reduce autoimmunity. Contemporary imaging, including contrast\u2010enhanced CT, locates thymic masses with >95% accuracy, guiding surgical planning and resection margins.","pathophysiology":"MG pathogenesis hinges on autoantibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic AChR at the motor endplate. The molecular cascade begins with thymic epithelial neoplasia aberrantly expressing AChR subunits and co\u2010stimulatory molecules (CD80/86), activating autoreactive CD4+ T cells through MHC II. These T cells secrete IL\u20104, IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1, promoting B\u2010cell differentiation in thymic germinal centers. Pathogenic IgG1 and IgG3 crosslink AChR, triggering complement C5b\u2010C9 membrane attack complex deposition, reducing receptor density by up to 80% within weeks. The safety factor falls below threshold, yielding fatigable weakness. Genetic predisposition involves HLA\u2010DR3 in early\u2010onset MG and HLA\u2010DR7 in late\u2010onset. Approximately 13% of cases have familial clustering, often with CTLA\u20104 polymorphisms.\n\nCompensatory upregulation of ACh release occurs but is outpaced by receptor loss. Energy demands at the endplate increase, depleting synaptic vesicle reservoirs over sustained activity. Within 6\u20138 weeks of antibody production, clinical symptoms peak. Regulatory T\u2010cell defects exacerbate chronicity; FOXP3 mutation carriers develop severe, early\u2010onset MG. Thymectomy removes the source of aberrant antigen presentation, halting new autoantibody generation over 6\u201312 months post\u2010resection.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset is often insidious, with fluctuating symptoms worsening toward evening. Initial ocular involvement occurs in 50\u201360%, manifesting as bilateral ptosis (35%) or diplopia (25%). Generalized MG follows within two years in 80%. Bulbar weakness includes dysphagia (45%), nasal regurgitation, and dysarthria. Limb proximal weakness affects neck extensor muscles first. Neurological exam reveals decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation (3 Hz), declining by \u226510% after the third stimulus. Forced vital capacity may drop from 4.0 L to 2.0 L in severe crisis.\n\nPediatric patients under 18 show 20% juvenile MG, often with ophthalmoplegia and thymic hyperplasia rather than thymoma. Elderly onset (>60 years) more frequently associates with thymoma (20%). Women predominate in early\u2010onset (female:male = 3:1), while late\u2010onset shows slight male predominance. Associated systemic manifestations include thyroid disease in 10\u201315% and rheumatoid arthritis in 2\u20134%. Red flags: respiratory rate >25/min, single\u2010breath count <15, indicating impending crisis. Untreated natural history leads to progressive weakness over 1\u20133 years, with crisis in 20\u201330% without therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion based on fatigable weakness. Step 2: Edrophonium (Tensilon) test yields transient improvement in 75\u201385% sensitivity, but carries 3\u20135% risk of bradyarrhythmia. Step 3: Serum anti\u2010AChR antibodies are positive in 85\u201390% of generalized MG, 50% in ocular only; MuSK antibodies in 5\u20138%. Specificity exceeds 98%. Step 4: Electrodiagnostics: Repetitive nerve stimulation at 2\u20133 Hz shows >10% decrement in 70% of generalized cases, single\u2010fiber EMG jitter increased in 95%.\n\nStep 5: Chest imaging with contrast CT or MRI of the mediastinum identifies thymoma in 10\u201315% and hyperplasia in 65\u201375%. Protocol: axial slices at 3 mm intervals with IV contrast 2 mL/kg. Step 6: Pulmonary function tests measure vital capacity and negative inspiratory force (normal \u201360 to \u2013100 cm H\u2082O). CSF is typically normal, excluding other neuromuscular conditions. Differential diagnoses: Lambert\u2013Eaton (presynaptic, small\u2010cell lung cancer screen by CT chest), congenital myasthenic syndromes (genetic panels, age <1 year), botulism (toxin assay), motor neuron disease (EMG denervation).","management_principles":"First-line symptomatic therapy uses pyridostigmine 30\u201360 mg orally every 4\u20136 hours, up to 720 mg/day, with cholinergic side effects monitored (diarrhea, salivation). Immunosuppression begins with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, tapering to 10\u201315 mg/day maintenance by 6 months. Azathioprine at 2\u20133 mg/kg/day added for steroid\u2010sparing effect; monitor TPMT levels prior. Mycophenolate mofetil 1,000 mg twice daily is second\u2010line if azathioprine intolerable. In crisis, IVIG 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days or plasma exchange five sessions every other day yields 70\u201380% rapid improvement. Rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74) for MuSK\u2010positive or refractory MG.\n\nThymectomy is indicated for all AChR antibody\u2013positive patients <60 years, including thymoma. Video\u2010assisted thoracoscopic surgery achieves remission in 65% at 3 years versus 45% with medical therapy alone (p=0.02). Contraindications include severe cardiopulmonary disease. Monitoring includes CBC, liver function every 3 months for azathioprine, chest CT annually for residual thymoma. Pregnancy management uses pyridostigmine and IVIG; avoid mycophenolate due to teratogenicity. Adjust dosing for renal impairment (reduce azathioprine by 25% if GFR<30).","follow_up_guidelines":"Post\u2010treatment evaluations occur at 1, 3, and 6 months, then biannually. Clinical monitoring uses quantitative MG score (QMG) target <5. Pulmonary function tests repeated monthly until vital capacity stabilizes >2.5 L. Anti\u2010AChR antibody titers measured every 6\u201312 months, though correlation with severity is modest. Surveillance imaging with chest CT at 6 months post\u2010thymectomy, then annually for 5 years to detect residual thymic tissue or recurrence (incidence ~5%). Long\u2010term complications include steroid\u2010induced osteoporosis (incidence 20% by 3 years), requiring DEXA scans every 12\u201324 months, and azathioprine\u2010related cytopenias (5%). One\u2010year remission is achieved in 35\u201345%, five\u2010year in 40\u201360%. Rehabilitation includes respiratory muscle training over 8\u201312 weeks and occupational therapy for fatigue management. Educate on myasthenic crisis recognition: respiratory distress, weak cough.

While small, asymptomatic dermoid cysts without paraneoplastic features might be monitored in general gynecology (e.g., <5 cm, premenopausal, no rapid growth over 6\u201312 months on serial ultrasound), in this syndrome failure to remove the tumor allows ongoing antigen exposure and neurological decline. Retrospective series show <5 % spontaneous remission without tumor removal.\n\nOption B: Chemotherapy (\u224855 words)\nEmpiric chemotherapy (e.g., platinum-based regimens) is not indicated for mature teratoma, which is benign in >90 % of cases. In malignant germ cell tumors with alpha-fetoprotein or beta-hCG elevation, BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin) may be used, but this is irrelevant in classic anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis with mature teratoma.

Guidelines (Graus et al. 2016) grade tumor removal as Class I recommendation.\n\nOption D: Radiation therapy (\u224855 words)\nRadiation is never used for benign mature teratoma due to high risk of ovarian failure and surrounding tissue damage. In malignant germ cell tumors with somatic transformation, radiotherapy can be an adjunct for unresectable lesions, but paraneoplastic encephalitis requires antigen elimination, not cytotoxic local control. Confusion often stems from radiation use in neurological tumors rather than gynecologic lesions.\n\nPathophysiological basis for C (\u224835 words)\nTeratoma contains neural tissue expressing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR1 subunits that trigger B-cell and T-cell responses. Surgical removal halts ongoing antigen presentation, downregulates plasmablasts, and restores blood\u2013brain barrier integrity.\n\nCommon misconceptions (\u224815 words)\nBelief that immunotherapy alone suffices; underestimation of teratoma prevalence (20\u201350 % in females <45).","conceptual_foundation":"The pathogenesis of anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis involves interaction between an ovarian teratoma\u2019s neural elements and central nervous system structures. Anatomically, the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit is widely expressed in hippocampal pyramidal cells (CA1\u2013CA3), dentate gyrus, neocortical layers II\u2013III, and striatal medium spiny neurons. These receptors mediate excitatory glutamatergic transmission crucial for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Embryologically, teratomas derive from primordial germ cells arrested during migration in the gonadal ridge (weeks 3\u20135), capable of differentiating into ectodermal neural tissue, endodermal gut-like tissue, and mesodermal components.\n\nUnder normal physiology, NMDA receptors require glycine co-agonism and depolarization to relieve the magnesium block, allowing Ca2+ influx that triggers downstream kinase cascades (CaMKII, MAPK). In anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis, autoantibodies cross the blood\u2013brain barrier\u2014often disrupted by cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1\u2014to target the extracellular domain of NR1, causing receptor internalization and hypofunction. Related neurological conditions include limbic encephalitis due to LGI1 or CASPR2 antibodies, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (anti-Yo), and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (anti-P/Q-type VGCC).\n\nHistorically, the concept evolved from initial case series in 2005 (Dalmau et al.), with the term \u201canti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis\u201d coined in 2007. Early landmark autopsy studies confirmed neuronal IgG deposition and complement activation. Key landmarks include recognition that ovarian teratoma resection improved outcomes in 80 % of cases versus 48 % with immunotherapy alone (Dalmau et al. 2008, Ann Neurol 63: 491\u2013498). Clinically, unilateral oophorectomy or cystectomy via laparoscopy is favored to preserve fertility while achieving complete excision of neural elements. Anatomic landmarks in surgery include the infundibulopelvic ligament, uterine artery at the cardinal ligament, and ovarian hilum to avoid vascular injury.","pathophysiology":"Anti\u2013NMDA receptor encephalitis is mediated by autoantibodies targeting the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor. Molecularly, B cells produce IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses that bind to the GluN1 extracellular N-terminal domain, fixing complement and triggering crosslinking of receptors. This leads to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reducing receptor density by 40\u201370 % on hippocampal neuron surfaces within 24\u201372 hours. Subsequent disruptions in Ca2+ signaling decrease activation of CaMKII and downstream transcription factors (CREB), impairing long-term potentiation. T-cell help is required, with CD4+ Th17 cells releasing IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1, further compromising the blood\u2013brain barrier via MMP-9 upregulation.\n\nGenetically, sporadic cases predominate, but HLA associations such as HLA-DQB1*05:02 increase risk by 2.4-fold. Rare familial clusters suggest polygenic susceptibility. Inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8) are elevated in CSF (mean IL-6: 50 pg/mL vs. <5 pg/mL controls) and correlate with disease severity scales. Energy deficits in affected neurons manifest as decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP depletion, contributing to synaptic failure. Over days to weeks, compensatory upregulation of AMPA receptors may occur, but this does not restore NMDA-dependent plasticity. Chronically, neuronal networks remodel, potentially leading to persistent cognitive deficits if untreated beyond 4 weeks.\n\nTime course: initial viral-like prodrome (1\u20132 weeks), psychiatric/cognitive decline (days 1\u201310), movement disorders and autonomic instability (weeks 2\u20134). Limitations of compensatory mechanisms include excitotoxic damage due to unopposed AMPA activity and microglial priming, which sets the stage for relapse in 15\u201320 % of patients if antigen source persists.\n","clinical_manifestation":"Onset typically begins with a nonspecific prodrome of fever, headache, and malaise lasting 1\u201314 days. A psychiatric phase follows (days 3\u201310), characterized by anxiety, agitation, delusions, and hallucinations; >70 % of adult patients present initially to psychiatric units. Within 5\u201314 days of onset, memory deficits, disorientation, and seizures occur (focal or generalized tonic\u2013clonic in 60 %). Movement disorders (orofacial dyskinesias, choreoathetosis) and dysautonomia (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) peak at 2\u20134 weeks. Hypoventilation requiring intubation is seen in 25\u201340 % of severe cases.\n\nNeurological examination reveals impaired attention, MoCA scores averaging 14/30, and prominent meningeal signs in 10 %. In pediatric patients (<18 years), behavioral regression and mutism are more common, whereas elderly patients (>65 years) may present with delirium and ataxia. Females (twice as common as males) often have teratoma; males more frequently have idiopathic forms or testicular tumors. Systemic manifestations can include cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation in 20 %), hypoventilation with PaCO2 >50 mm Hg, and SIADH in 15 %.\n\nSeverity is graded by the CASE (Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis) with scores from 0 (normal) to 27 (comatose). Red flags include rapid progression (<72 hours), refractory status epilepticus, and failure to detect any antigen source by week 3. Without treatment, mortality reaches 25 % and permanent deficits occur in >50 % by 1 year. Natural history involves 6\u201318 months of oscillating symptoms, often culminating in severe cognitive impairment and movement disorders.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical suspicion in a patient with subacute psychiatric symptoms plus neurological signs. Step 2: First-line tests include MRI brain (T2/FLAIR hippocampal hyperintensity in 25 %, sensitivity 30 %, specificity 95 %) and EEG (diffuse delta slowing in 85 %, extreme delta brush in 30 %). CSF analysis shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (mean 20 cells/\u00b5L, 90 % mononuclear), elevated protein (60\u201380 mg/dL), and oligoclonal bands in 60 %. Anti\u2013NMDA receptor IgG in CSF has sensitivity 98 % and specificity 100 %; serum testing is less sensitive (85 %).\n\nStep 3: Tumor screening with pelvic ultrasound (sensitivity 95 % for teratoma >2 cm) and pelvic MRI if ultrasound is equivocal. If negative and high suspicion, whole-body FDG-PET identifies occult teratoma in 10 % of cases. Step 4: Second-line investigations include CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for non-ovarian malignancies, thymoma screening, and testicular ultrasound in males.\n\nElectrophysiology: EMG/NCS is normal in pure encephalitis but may reveal secondary myopathy after prolonged ICU stay. Autoimmune panel: CSF anti\u2013NMDA receptor cell-based assay titer typically 1:20\u20131:100. Differential diagnoses: viral encephalitis (HSV PCR positive, RBCs >2/mm3 on CSF), anti-LGI1 ( faciobrachial dystonic seizures, hyponatremia), metabolic/toxic encephalopathy (electrolyte derangements), primary psychiatric disorders (no abnormal CSF or EEG). Decision points center on antibody detection and tumor localization within 4 weeks to optimize outcome.","management_principles":"First-line immunotherapy involves corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily \u00d75 days), then oral prednisone taper (1 mg/kg over 6 weeks). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days or plasmapheresis (5 exchanges over 10 days) is combined in 80 % of protocols. Early tumor removal (oophorectomy or cystectomy) within 4 weeks is essential; laparoscopy is preferred for minimal morbidity. Failure to improve by 4 weeks warrants second-line agents: rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d74) or cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2 IV monthly \u00d76), which achieve remission in 70\u201380 % of refractory cases.\n\nThird-line salvage therapies include bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 days 1,4,8,11) for refractory disease. Drug interactions: cyclophosphamide with allopurinol increases cytopenia risk; rituximab requires Pneumocystis prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Contraindications: live vaccines within 4 weeks of rituximab, active infection. Non-pharmacological support: seizure management (levetiracetam 20 mg/kg loading, then 10 mg/kg BID), dyskinesia control (tetrabenazine 12.5 mg TID). ICU care addresses autonomic instability and hypoventilation; success rates of tumor removal + immunotherapy exceed 85 % at 12 months.\n\nSpecial populations: in pregnancy, methylprednisolone and IVIG are safe; cyclophosphamide reserved postpartum. In renal impairment, adjust IVIG infusion rates; rituximab dosing unchanged but monitor clearance. In hepatic failure, avoid high-dose steroids and cyclophosphamide; use IVIG monotherapy and plasmapheresis.","follow_up_guidelines":"Clinical re-evaluation every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, then monthly until 6 months, and quarterly to 12 months. Monitor CASE and mRS (modified Rankin Scale) scores, aiming for mRS \u22642 by 12 months. Laboratory surveillance: repeat CSF antibody titers at 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months; target titer reduction >80 % from baseline. Imaging: pelvic ultrasound at 3 months post-resection to rule out recurrence (incidence 5\u201310 %). MRI brain at 6 months for resolution of hippocampal changes.\n\nLong-term complications include cognitive deficits (30 % incidence), persistent seizures (10 %), and mood disorders (25 %). One-year functional independence (mRS \u22642) achieved in 70 %; five-year relapse rate is 15 %. Rehabilitation: cognitive therapy begins at 4 weeks, occupational therapy from 6 weeks, speech therapy for dysarthria and memory strategies. Patient education covers seizure safety, infection signs while immunosuppressed, and teratoma recurrence risks. Driving is permitted once off antiepileptic drugs and seizure-free for 6 months.

Multiple case series and retrospective cohort studies have demonstrated that early tumor resection, combined with immunotherapy, significantly improves neurological outcomes and reduces relapse rates. For example, Titulaer et al. reported in a multicenter cohort that patients undergoing tumor removal within one month of symptom onset had a 75% full recovery rate versus 47% in those with delayed or no resection (Lancet Neurol. 2013;12(2):157\u2013165). Guideline recommendations (e.g., Graus et al., 2016) classify tumor removal as a first-line intervention (Level B evidence) in paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis.\n\nObservation alone (option A) is insufficient because the underlying antigen source persists, perpetuating the immune response. Chemotherapy (option B) is not indicated, as the teratoma is generally benign and surgical excision is curative. Radiation therapy (option D) does not apply to mature teratomas and carries unnecessary risks. Surgical removal eliminates the antigenic stimulus, allows for histopathologic confirmation, and, when combined with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasmapheresis, maximizes the likelihood of functional recovery.","source_file":"Promotion 2023_mcqs_processed.json","import_specialty":"Neuroimmunology","import_source":"neuroimmunology_mcqs.json"},{"question_number":"3","question":"A patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated by nephritis presents with acute behavioral changes and seizures. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows lymphocytosis and positive oligoclonal bands (OCB). Which of the following conditions is most likely?","options":["Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis","SLE cerebritis","Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)","Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"SLE cerebritis","subspecialty":"Neuroimmunology","explanation":{"option_analysis":"The correct answer is B: SLE cerebritis. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), neuropsychiatric lupus can manifest with seizures and acute behavioral changes. CSF findings of lymphocytic pleocytosis and positive oligoclonal bands are characteristic of inflammatory autoimmune CNS involvement rather than infectious etiologies (Hanly et al., 2019). Option A (HSV encephalitis) typically shows neutrophilic predominance early and red blood cells from hemorrhagic necrosis, with HSV PCR positivity; OCBs are not a feature. Option C (PRES) presents with vasogenic edema on MRI and normal CSF. Option D (CVT) can cause seizures but usually has raised opening pressure and imaging evidence of venous thrombosis without OCB positivity.","conceptual_foundation":"Neuropsychiatric SLE encompasses a spectrum of syndromes including organic psychosis, seizure disorders, and cognitive dysfunction. In ICD-11, it is classified under autoimmune diseases affecting the central nervous system. The pathogenesis involves autoantibody-mediated blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, complement activation, and infiltrating lymphocytes. The condition differs from infectious causes by its immunologic markers (anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm) and absence of pathogens on culture or PCR.","pathophysiology":"Normal CNS homeostasis is maintained by blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and regulated immune surveillance. In SLE cerebritis, immune complexes and autoantibodies (e.g., anti-NR2) promote complement activation, endothelial injury, and cytokine release (IL-6, IFN-\u03b1). Lymphocytic infiltration follows, leading to neuronal dysfunction and seizures. In contrast, HSV encephalitis is driven by viral cytopathic effects, and PRES by endothelial dysfunction secondary to hypertension.","clinical_manifestation":"Patients present with acute seizures (40\u201360%), psychosis (15\u201330%), cognitive dysfunction, and mood disturbances. Onset may be subacute to acute, often in the setting of active systemic disease (nephritis, arthritis). Fever may be mild or absent. Focal deficits can occur if vasculitis coexists. Relapses are common without immunosuppression.","diagnostic_approach":"First-line evaluation includes MRI brain with contrast\u2014usually normal or showing nonspecific hyperintensities\u2014CSF analysis revealing lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013100 cells/\u00b5L) and positive oligoclonal bands. Autoimmune panels (anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, complement levels) help confirm systemic activity. Infectious PCRs (HSV, VZV) must be negative. EEG may show diffuse slowing.","management_principles":"High-dose corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 g IV \u00d7 3\u20135 days) are first-line, often combined with cyclophosphamide for severe disease (AAN practice parameter, 2020). Hydroxychloroquine is continued for systemic control. Rituximab or mycophenolate mofetil may be used for refractory cases. Antiepileptic drugs manage seizures.","follow_up_guidelines":"Monitor neurologic status weekly during induction, then monthly. MRI and CSF studies are repeated only if clinical worsening occurs. Taper steroids over 3\u20136 months guided by clinical and serologic markers (anti-dsDNA, complement). Long-term remission requires maintenance immunosuppression (azathioprine or mycophenolate).","clinical_pearls":"1. OCB positivity in SLE suggests CNS autoimmunity rather than infection. 2. Negative infectious PCRs are required before escalating immunosuppression. 3. Seizures may persist even after systemic disease control. 4. PRES can mimic lupus cerebritis clinically but has characteristic MRI findings. 5. Complement levels (C3, C4) often correlate with disease activity.","references":"1. Hanly JG et al.
