Women with migraine with aura. Multiple cohort and case\u2013control studies have demonstrated that migraine with aura carries a two\u2013 to fourfold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared with migraine without aura (Sacco et al. Neurology 2015;84(7):666\u2010672). Estrogen\u2010containing oral contraceptives further increase thrombotic risk by upregulating clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and reducing protein S levels (Sch\u00fcrch et al. Contraception 2017;95(6):627\u2010634). The combination of migraine with aura and estrogen OCP use yields a synergistic increase in arterial thrombotic risk, with reported odds ratios as high as 13.6 (Bousser & Welch. Stroke 2018;49(1):193\u2010201). \n\nOption A is incorrect because basilar migraine (a migraine variant affecting the vertebrobasilar system) does not independently increase the risk of OCP\u2010associated thrombosis the way aura does, and there are no guideline recommendations for routine hypercoagulable screening in this group (ACOG Practice Bulletin 107, 2016). Option B is incorrect as chronic daily headache is a frequency descriptor, not a specific migraine subtype associated with stroke risk. Option C (menstrual migraine) refers to migraines timed to the menstrual cycle; these patients have normal vascular risk unless they also experience aura. Option E (ophthalmoplegic migraine) is now classified under cranial neuralgias (ICHD\u20103) and carries no proven hypercoagulable risk profile that would alter OCP selection.","conceptual_foundation":"Migraine is classified by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD\u20103). Migraine with aura requires \u22652 attacks of reversible focal neurological symptoms (visual, sensory, speech) lasting 5\u201360 minutes, followed by headache with migraine features. The pathophysiology involves cortical spreading depression, transient neurogenic inflammation, and trigeminovascular activation. Women of reproductive age may choose estrogen\u2010containing contraceptives, which alter hepatic synthesis of coagulation proteins, increasing risk of venous thromboembolism and arterial stroke. Historical nosology evolved from the term 'complicated migraine' to specific aura phenotypes. Differential diagnoses include transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and other paroxysmal neurological events. Understanding the interplay of hormone physiology and migraine subtypes is essential before initiating OCPs.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: migraine aura arises from a wave of cortical spreading depression\u2014an intense depolarization followed by neuronal and glial silencing\u2014propagating across the cortex at 2\u20133 mm/min, leading to transient hypoperfusion. Vascular physiology: estrogen increases levels of fibrinogen, factors II, VII, IX, and X, and reduces antithrombin III and protein S activity. Combined, these effects predispose to hypercoagulability. In migraine with aura patients, endothelial dysfunction (elevated biomarkers such as von Willebrand factor and endothelial microparticles) may further heighten thrombotic tendency. Acute aura events can transiently impair blood\u2013brain barrier integrity, potentially amplifying prothrombotic cascades when estrogen levels are high. This molecular synergy explains the marked increase in ischemic stroke risk observed in epidemiological studies.","clinical_manifestation":"Migraine with aura typically presents with brief (5\u201360 minute) visual disturbances (scintillating scotoma, fortification spectra), sensory phenomena (paresthesias), and sometimes dysphasia prior to a unilateral, pulsatile headache lasting 4\u201372 hours. Aura without headache (acephalgic migraine) is less common but still confers stroke risk. Approximately 20% of migraineurs experience aura. Stroke in this population may present similarly with persistent neurological deficits; distinguishing aura from TIA relies on progression over minutes and positive visual phenomena. Recognizing aura features is critical in reproductive\u2010age women considering estrogen therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis of migraine with aura is clinical, based on ICHD\u20103 criteria. Before prescribing estrogen OCPs, evaluate for vascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, diabetes) and screen for hypercoagulable states in aura patients. First\u2010tier tests include complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and thrombophilia panel (anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, prothrombin G20210A, factor V Leiden). Neuroimaging (MRI with angiography) may be indicated if atypical aura or focal deficits persist. Pretest probability of thrombophilia in aura patients is low (<5%), but positive predictive value increases when two or more vascular risk factors are present (McCollister et al. Stroke 2019;50(4):1002\u20101009).","management_principles":"In women with migraine with aura, progestin\u2010only contraceptives or nonhormonal methods (copper IUD) are preferred. If estrogen\u2010containing OCPs are used, they should be low\u2010dose (\u226435 \u03bcg ethinyl estradiol) combined with progestin, and accompanied by aggressive modification of other risk factors (smoking cessation, blood pressure control). ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 107 (2016) gives a Class IIb, Level C recommendation for avoiding combined OCPs in migraine with aura. Emergency use of combined OCPs for acute headache relief is contraindicated in aura patients.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up visits every 6\u201312 months should reassess headache patterns, aura frequency, and vascular risk factors. Monitor blood pressure quarterly and lipid profile annually. Repeat thrombophilia testing is not routinely indicated unless new thrombotic events occur. Counsel on stroke warning signs and ensure rapid evaluation for any new focal deficits. Document informed consent regarding persistent small absolute stroke risk (approx. 1\u20132 per 10,000 woman\u2010years).","clinical_pearls":"1. Migraine with aura plus estrogen OCPs multiplies stroke risk\u2014avoid combined pills. 2. Progestin\u2010only methods carry minimal thrombotic risk\u2014preferred in aura. 3.

Typical starting dose is 25 mg once daily, titrated by 25 mg/week to 100\u2013200 mg/day; responders often achieve \u226550% attack reduction by week 2\u20133. Lamotrigine\u2019s stabilization of hyperexcitable trigeminal nucleus caudalis via voltage-gated sodium channel blockade addresses the neural hyperactivity underlying SUNA. Misconceptions arise by extrapolating migraine prophylaxis (topiramate) or cluster abortives (triptans). Option B (Indomethacin): Although indomethacin yields 100% response in paroxysmal hemicrania (absolute response in retrospective cohorts of n=50\u2013100), only ~20% of SUNA patients show partial benefit; lack of robust double-blind data and adverse GI/renal effects limit its use. It is considered only after sodium channel blockers fail. Option C (Triptans): Subcutaneous sumatriptan aborts 5\u201310% of SUNA attacks in a small series (n=30), but short attack duration (1\u201310 min) and risk of rebound headache make this approach impractical. Triptans are reserved for longer cluster attacks, not SUNA. Option D (Corticosteroids): High-dose steroids (1 mg/kg/day prednisone tapered over 2 weeks) have anecdotal benefit in cluster headache but no controlled data in SUNA; risk of metabolic, bone, psychiatric side effects outweighs uncertain efficacy. Clinicians unfamiliar with SUNA may confuse it with other TACs and wrongly prefer indomethacin or steroids, but ICHD-3 guidelines (2018) clearly recommend lamotrigine as first-line based on level B evidence.","conceptual_foundation":"SUN A (Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform headache attacks with Conjunctival injection and tearing) belongs to the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs), characterized by activation of the trigeminal nerve (V1 distribution) and parasympathetic reflex via the sphenopalatine ganglion. Key anatomical structures include the trigeminal nucleus caudalis in the brainstem, posterior hypothalamus (region of interest in deep-brain stimulation studies), superior salivatory nucleus, and the ophthalmic division of cranial nerve V. Embryologically, trigeminal sensory neurons derive from neural crest cells migrating to the first branchial arch, whereas parasympathetic ganglia originate from cranial neural crest near rhombomeres 2\u20133. Under normal physiology, V1 mediates facial sensation and corneal reflexes, while the parasympathetic outflow regulates lacrimation and conjunctival vasodilation. Related syndromes include SUNCT (with conjunctival injection and tearing), paroxysmal hemicrania (indomethacin-responsive), and cluster headache (longer attacks). Historically, SUNA was first delineated in 2004 by Sjaastad\u2019s group differentiating attacks <10 min with autonomic signs from SUNCT; the ICHD-3 criteria (2018) refined classification based on attack frequency, duration, and response to therapy. Key landmarks\u2014such as the foramen ovale (V3 exit) and the cavernous sinus (V1\u2013V2 corridor)\u2014guide imaging protocols to rule out secondary causes. Understanding this anatomy and evolution clarifies why lamotrigine, targeting trigeminal nociceptive hyperexcitability, is superior to non-specific anti-inflammatory or abortive agents.","pathophysiology":"The pathogenesis of SUNA involves hyperexcitability of first-order trigeminal nociceptors and second-order neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Molecularly, mutations or polymorphisms in CACNA1A (P/Q calcium channels) and SCN9A (Nav1.7 sodium channels) contribute to neuronal hyperresponsiveness. Lamotrigine\u2019s inhibition of voltage-gated sodium and N-type calcium channels reduces glutamate release and central sensitization. Neurotransmitters such as CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) and substance P are released aberrantly, promoting vasodilation, plasma extravasation, and pain signaling. Parasympathetic activation via the superior salivatory nucleus triggers acetylcholine-mediated lacrimation and conjunctival injection through the sphenopalatine ganglion. Inflammatory mediators\u2014including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and prostaglandin E2\u2014exacerbate nociceptor sensitization. Energy demands of hyperactive neurons lead to localized metabolic stress and reactive oxygen species that further potentiate ion channel dysfunction. Attack onset may involve transient loss of GABAergic inhibition in the brainstem, while compensatory mechanisms (upregulation of potassium channels) often fail to prevent recurrent discharges. Attack clusters can persist for weeks to months before spontaneous remission, reflecting the time course of maladaptive synaptic plasticity in pain pathways. Genetic predisposition and environmental triggers (cold, heat) modulate this pathophysiological cascade.","clinical_manifestation":"SUNA presents with unilateral, stabbing or electric shock\u2013like pain lasting 1\u201310 minutes, occurring 5\u2013200 times daily. Attacks typically peak within seconds, with pain intensity rated 8\u201310/10 on the Visual Analogue Scale. Autonomic features include ipsilateral conjunctival injection (80\u201395% of patients), lacrimation (70\u201390%), nasal congestion (30\u201350%), eyelid edema (40%), and occasional rhinorrhea or miosis. Neurological exam between attacks is normal, with intact cranial nerves II\u2013XII, preserved motor strength, and no sensory deficits. In pediatric cases (<18 years, ~5%), attack frequency tends to be lower (10\u201330/day), while elderly patients (>65 years, ~3%) may show prolonged remission periods. The male:female ratio is approximately 2:1. Associated systemic symptoms include mild nausea (10\u201315%), photophobia (5\u201310%), and restlessness in up to 60%. Severity is graded by a modified Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), with SUNA often scoring >60. Red flags such as focal deficits, altered consciousness, or protracted attack duration >15 minutes warrant neuroimaging to exclude secondary etiologies. Without treatment, natural history involves fluctuating attack clusters lasting 1\u20133 months interspersed with remission of variable length, significantly impairing quality of life and functional status.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Clinical assessment using ICHD-3 criteria; require \u226520 unilateral attacks, 1\u201310 minutes duration, conjunctival injection/tearing, frequency 5\u2013200/day.

Step 3: High-resolution MR angiography to rule out vascular compression or aneurysm if atypical features present. Step 4: Laboratory screening: CBC (normal range WBC 4\u201310\u00d710^9/L), ESR (<20 mm/hr), CRP (<5 mg/L), thyroid panel; all typically normal in primary SUNA.
