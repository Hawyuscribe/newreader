[{"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior muscles.","subspecialty":"Neuromuscular","explanation":"Overview of L5 Nerve Root Innervation\n\nThe L5 nerve root plays a critical role in lower limb motor function, particularly in muscles responsible for ankle dorsiflexion and foot inversion. In clinical practice, injury or compression of the L5 root (e.g., by a herniated disc at L4\u2013L5) manifests as foot drop, weakened inversion, and gait disturbances. Recognizing the key muscles innervated by L5 allows accurate localization of radiculopathies and planning of targeted rehabilitation or surgical intervention.\n\nWhy Option B Is Correct\n\nOption B pairs two major L5\u2010innervated muscles:\n\n1. Tibialis Anterior\n   \u2022 Innervation: Deep branch of the common peroneal (fibular) nerve (primarily L4 and L5 fibers).\n   \u2022 Function: Ankle dorsiflexion and inversion.  \n   \u2022 Clinical Correlate: Weakness leads to foot drop (slapping gait) and difficulty clearing the toes during swing phase.\n\n2. Tibialis Posterior\n   \u2022 Innervation: Tibial nerve (primarily L4 and L5 fibers).  \n   \u2022 Function: Foot inversion and support of the medial longitudinal arch.  \n   \u2022 Clinical Correlate: Weakness leads to a \u2018\u2018flatfoot\u2019\u2019 deformity, inability to invert the foot against resistance.\n\nBoth muscles share L5 contributions as their principal root. Electrophysiological studies and anatomical dissections confirm that tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior receive their motor fibers predominantly from L5 (with occasional minor contributions from adjacent roots). A lesion at L5 thus concurrently affects these muscles.\n\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect\n\nOption A: Tibialis Anterior and Iliopsoas  \n\u2022 Iliopsoas (psoas major and iliacus) is innervated by ventral rami L1\u2013L3 (most prominently L2 and L3 via the femoral nerve).  \n\u2022 Although tibialis anterior involves L5, iliopsoas does not receive significant L5 innervation.  \n\u2022 Thus this pairing mixes two separate root levels (L5 vs L1\u2013L3).\n\nOption C: Tibialis Anterior and Gastrocnemius  \n\u2022 Gastrocnemius is innervated by the tibial nerve with root fibers S1\u2013S2.  \n\u2022 Tibialis anterior is L4\u2013L5.  \n\u2022 The roots do not overlap sufficiently to attribute both to L5.\n\nOption D: Tibialis Posterior and Hip Adductors  \n\u2022 Hip adductors (adductor longus, brevis, magnus) are innervated by the obturator nerve (primarily L2\u2013L4).  \n\u2022 While tibialis posterior receives L4\u2013L5 fibers, the adductors do not involve L5 substantially.  \n\u2022 Therefore they cannot be considered a pure L5\u2010innervated pair.\n\nKey Concepts and Pathophysiology\n\n1. Radicular Innervation vs. Peripheral Nerves\n   \u2022 Spinal nerve roots (e.g., L5) contribute fibers to multiple peripheral nerves.  \n   \u2022 Identifying which muscles are most strongly associated with a given root helps localize radiculopathies versus plexopathies or peripheral mononeuropathies.\n\n2. Muscle Testing\n   \u2022 Manual muscle testing grades tibialis anterior (ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension) and tibialis posterior (inversion) on a 0\u20135 scale.  \n   \u2022 In an L5 radiculopathy, both muscles may show 0\u20134/5 weakness, while muscles dominated by adjacent roots (e.g., quadriceps, gastrocnemius) are spared.\n\n3. Reflexes and Sensory Findings\n   \u2022 L5 does not have a deep tendon reflex tested in isolation; reflexes for L4 (patellar) and S1 (Achilles) are preserved in pure L5 lesions.  \n   \u2022 Sensory loss often appears on the dorsum of the foot and medial aspect of the big toe (L5 dermatome).\n\n4. Electrodiagnostic Confirmation\n   \u2022 Needle EMG: Denervation potentials in tibialis anterior and posterior support L5 root involvement.  \n   \u2022 Nerve conduction studies rule out peripheral mononeuropathies (e.g., peroneal neuropathy) by demonstrating normal distal conduction velocities.\n\nClinical Pearls\n\n\u2022 Foot Drop Differential: L5 radiculopathy vs. peroneal nerve injury.  \n  - In L5 radiculopathy, inversion (tibialis posterior) and toe extension (extensor hallucis longus) are weak.  \n  - In peroneal neuropathy, inversion is spared, since tibialis posterior is intact.\n\n\u2022 Flatfoot Development: Chronic tibialis posterior weakness leads to acquired adult flatfoot due to unopposed eversion and collapse of the medial arch.\n\n\u2022 Imaging Correlation: MRI of the lumbar spine often reveals an L4\u2013L5 disc herniation compressing the traversing L5 root in the lateral recess or neural foramen.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

It results in paralysis of all ipsilateral muscles of facial expression and other motor targets of the facial nerve distal to the stylomastoid foramen. In the evaluation of Bell\u2019s palsy with nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG), one tests muscles innervated by the facial nerve to assess the degree of axonal degeneration and to help predict prognosis. Among the answer choices, the stylohyoid muscle is uniquely supplied by a branch of the facial nerve; therefore it would demonstrate reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude on NCS and fibrillation potentials on EMG 10 to 14 days after onset.\n\nWhy the Correct Answer is Right\n\u2022 Anatomy and Innervation: The facial nerve exits the brainstem at the pontomedullary sulcus and enters the internal auditory canal. After traversing the facial canal, it gives off the greater petrosal nerve, nerve to stapedius, and chorda tympani, before exiting the skull via the stylomastoid foramen. The extracranial facial nerve then innervates muscles of facial expression and three small non\u2013facial expression muscles: stapedius, posterior belly of digastric, and stylohyoid. The stylohyoid muscle receives its motor fibers from the cervical branch of the facial nerve. In Bell\u2019s palsy, this branch is involved, leading to weakness of stylohyoid contraction and denervation changes on NCS/EMG.\n\u2022 Electrophysiologic Findings: NCS of the facial nerve is performed by stimulating at the stylomastoid foramen and recording from facial muscles. Affected muscles show decreased CMAP amplitude in direct proportion to axonal loss. EMG conducted 2\u20133 weeks after symptom onset reveals fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in denervated muscle fibers. The stylohyoid, as a facial nerve target, meets these criteria.\n\nWhy Other Options Are Wrong\nA. Levator Palpebrae Superioris: Innervated by the superior division of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III), not by the facial nerve. Bell\u2019s palsy does not affect this muscle\u2019s function or its NCS/EMG.\nC. Temporalis: A muscle of mastication innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V3). Facial nerve lesions spare trigeminal motor targets.\nD. Masseter: Also a muscle of mastication under motor control of the mandibular division of CN V. It remains normal in peripheral facial palsy.\n\nKey Concepts and Pathophysiology\n1. Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) vs Central Lesions: Bell\u2019s palsy is a LMN lesion affecting the entire ipsilateral hemiface, including the forehead, orbicularis oculi, and orbicularis oris. Central (supranuclear) lesions spare the forehead due to bilateral cortical innervation of the upper facial nucleus.\n2. Temporal Evolution of EMG Changes: Wallerian degeneration reaches the muscle by 7\u201310 days post-injury, with fibrillation potentials appearing by 10\u201314 days. Early NCS (<72 hours) may be normal despite clinical paralysis; repeating studies at 3 weeks provides prognostic data.\n3. Prognostic Value: If CMAP amplitude is preserved (>90% of contralateral side), prognosis is excellent. Absence of voluntary motor unit potentials on EMG by 3\u20134 weeks suggests poor recovery and may warrant surgical decompression considerations.\n\nClinical Pearls\n\u2013 Test stapedial reflex: Hyperacusis is often present in Bell\u2019s palsy because of paralysis of the stapedius. \n\u2013 Corneal protection: Paralysis of orbicularis oculi can lead to exposure keratitis; emphasize eye care. \n\u2013 Corticosteroids within 72 hours of onset improve functional recovery. \n\u2013 MRI is usually normal; contrast enhancement of the facial nerve in the geniculate ganglion may be seen in some cases.\n\nReferences\n1.

Muscle biopsy remains the gold standard for confirming Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) when genetic testing is unavailable. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrate absence or marked reduction of dystrophin protein in muscle fibers (Emery et al. 2010). Serum creatine kinase (CK) level (option A) is a sensitive screening test but not confirmatory, as CK is elevated in many myopathies. Muscle MRI (option C) can characterize patterns of fatty infiltration but cannot definitively diagnose DMD. Frequent pulmonary function tests (option D) monitor progression but do not establish diagnosis.","conceptual_foundation":"DMD is an X-linked recessive dystrophinopathy caused by mutations in the DMD gene on Xp21, leading to absent dystrophin protein and progressive muscle fiber degeneration. It falls under ICD-11 code 8C50.01. Differential diagnoses include Becker muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, and congenital myopathies. Historically, muscle biopsy became diagnostic in the 1980s after dystrophin was identified (Hoffman et al. 1987). Dystrophin anchors the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in muscle cells; its absence causes membrane fragility.","pathophysiology":"Normal muscle fibers rely on the dystrophin\u2013glycoprotein complex for structural integrity. In DMD, absence of dystrophin leads to myofiber damage, calcium influx, activation of proteases, and chronic inflammation. Repeated cycles of degeneration and regeneration exhaust satellite cells, leading to replacement of muscle by fat and connective tissue.
