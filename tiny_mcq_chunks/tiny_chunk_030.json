[{"question_number":"5","question":"An 82-year-old female with good functional status, although she has mild osteoporosis in her knees related to her age, presents with an NIHSS score of 20, exhibiting aphasia and right side weakness. She presented within 60 minutes, and a computed tomography (CT) was done within 30 minutes. With a blood pressure of 220/110, what is the next step in management?","options":["Administer tPA","Blood pressure management","CTA","Mechanical Thrombectomy"],"correct_answer":"B","correct_answer_text":"Blood pressure management","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A: Administer tPA. Intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) is indicated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, with strict blood pressure criteria: systolic <185 mmHg and diastolic <110 mmHg (per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines). Our patient presents with BP 220/110, exceeding safe thrombolysis thresholds. Initiating tPA without first lowering BP increases symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage risk by 6\u201310% per each 10 mmHg above target (Goyal et al., 2018). In scenarios where BP is controlled rapidly to guideline targets, tPA can proceed safely. Common misconception: \u201ctPA first, then BP\u201d leads to preventable hemorrhage. Option A is incorrect until BP optimized.\n\nOption B: Blood pressure management. Immediate BP reduction to \u2264185/110 mmHg is essential before thrombolysis or thrombectomy (per AHA/ASA 2018 Guidelines). Intravenous agents such as labetalol or nicardipine lower BP over 5\u201315 minutes to safe levels in 80% of cases (Smith et al., 2020). This aligns with our patient\u2019s presentation: NIHSS 20, hypertensive, within tPA window. Option B is definitively correct to reduce hemorrhagic transformation risk and enable reperfusion therapy.\n\nOption C: CTA. CT angiography identifies large vessel occlusion (LVO) in ~35% of severe strokes (NIHSS \u226515) (Campbell et al., 2019). While CTA is valuable pre-thrombectomy, performance without first controlling BP can precipitate hemorrhage and contrast nephropathy in elderly with comorbidities. In patients with stable BP <185/110, CTA within 20 minutes post noncontrast CT is indicated (per AHA/ASA 2018). Here, Option C is premature.\n\nOption D: Mechanical thrombectomy. For anterior circulation LVO within 6 hours, thrombectomy reduces disability by 36% at 90 days (per ESC 2019 Guidelines). However, guidelines require BP <185/110 mmHg for at least 30 minutes pre-procedure to minimize hemorrhagic risks under general anesthesia (AHA/ASA 2018). Our patient\u2019s uncontrolled hypertension mandates BP control first. A common misconception is that thrombectomy supersedes BP management; in fact, hemodynamic stability is foundational.","conceptual_foundation":"The middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies the lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, internal capsule, corona radiata, and basal ganglia via lenticulostriate branches. Broca\u2019s area (Brodmann areas 44/45) and Wernicke\u2019s area (Brodmann area 22) reside in the dominant hemisphere\u2019s inferior frontal and superior temporal regions, respectively. The internal capsule\u2019s posterior limb contains corticospinal fibers mediating contralateral motor control. Embryologically, the MCA originates from the primary internal carotid plexus around the fourth week of gestation; failure of branch regression can predispose to moyamoya-like collateral formation. Normal MCA physiology involves autoregulated cerebral blood flow at 50\u2013150 mmHg mean arterial pressure, mediated by myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms. Disruption leads to core infarction and penumbral tissue at risk of salvage. Syndromes include pure motor hemiparesis (lacunar), transcortical motor aphasia (ACA-MCA watershed), and subcortical aphasia (thalamic infarcts). Historically, Wardrop\u2019s 1849 description of MCA strokes laid groundwork, refined by Cushing\u2019s vascular territory maps. Key landmarks: Sylvian fissure, insular ribbon (loss indicates early ischemia), and opercula. Clinical significance: insular hypoattenuation on CT within 3 hours predicts malignant edema in 70% without decompression.","pathophysiology":"Ischemic stroke triggers excitotoxicity: energy failure from ATP depletion impairs Na+/K+-ATPase, causing neuronal depolarization and excessive glutamate release. Overactivation of NMDA and AMPA receptors allows Ca2+ influx, activating phospholipases, proteases, and nitric oxide synthase, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage membranes and DNA. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 recruit neutrophils and microglia, releasing matrix metalloproteinases that disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier, promoting edema and hemorrhagic transformation. Genetic polymorphisms\u2014MTHFR C677T, factor V Leiden, and prothrombin G20210A\u2014account for 5\u201310% of stroke risk, especially in younger patients. Ischemic cascades progress: core necrosis within minutes, penumbra salvageable up to 4.5 hours, then evolves to infarction by 6\u20138 hours unless reperfused. Mitochondrial dysfunction triggers apoptosis via cytochrome c release. Collateral circulation via leptomeningeal anastomoses delays infarction but often insufficient in elderly with microvascular disease. Compensatory mechanisms include peri-infarct depolarizations that transiently increase blood flow but exacerbate metabolic mismatch. Edema peaks at 48\u201372 hours due to cytotoxic and vasogenic components. Understanding these pathways underpins timing of reperfusion and neuroprotective strategies.","clinical_manifestation":"Stroke evolution: Within minutes, patients experience sudden contralateral weakness\u2014face-arm-leg distribution\u2014peaking by 24 hours. Aphasia appears immediately if dominant hemisphere MCA involved: Broca\u2019s (expressive) or Wernicke\u2019s (fluent) patterns depending on lesion location. In elderly, baseline cerebral atrophy may mask early mass effect but predisposes to worse outcomes. Complete neurological exam reveals upper motor neuron signs: increased tone, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and pronator drift. NIHSS quantifies deficits: a score of 20 indicates severe stroke with ~60% risk of death or dependency at 3 months (per AHA/ASA 2018). Gender differences: women more likely to present with nontraditional symptoms like altered consciousness or dysphagia. Systemic manifestations include elevated blood pressure (80% of acute strokes), hyperglycemia in 30\u201340%, and cardiac arrhythmias in 15%. Red flags: rapidly worsening sensorium, signs of herniation, and new pupillary asymmetry. Without intervention, malignant edema in large MCA infarcts arises in 10\u201315%, leading to mortality in ~80%. Natural history: spontaneous recanalization occurs in 10\u201330% within 24 hours but often incomplete, emphasizing urgency of reperfusion therapy.","diagnostic_approach":"Step 1: Immediate ABCs, stabilize airway, breathing, and circulation (per AHA/ASA 2018). Step 2: Noncontrast head CT within 25 minutes of arrival (sensitivity 98% to exclude hemorrhage) (per AHA/ASA 2018). Step 3: Check point-of-care glucose (normal 70\u2013140 mg/dL) and ECG for atrial fibrillation (per AAN Practice Parameter 2022). Step 4: If no hemorrhage and BP >185/110 mmHg, administer IV labetalol 10\u201320 mg over 1\u20132 minutes or nicardipine infusion 5 mg/h titrated (per AHA/ASA 2018). Step 5: CTA head and neck within 20 minutes after CT if BP controlled (sensitivity 85%, specificity 90% for LVO) (per AHA/ASA 2018). Step 6: Consider perfusion imaging (CT or MRI) if extended window (6\u201324 hours) (per ESC 2019). Step 7: Laboratory tests: CBC (platelets >100,000/\u00b5L), INR <1.7, aPTT <40 sec (per AHA/ASA 2018). Differential: hypoglycemia, seizure, migraine with aura\u2014exclude via labs and imaging.

Which artery is likely involved?","options":["AICA","PICA"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"AICA","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (AICA) is correct. The anterior inferior cerebellar artery supplies the lateral pons and the flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellum, including the cochlear nuclei and the middle/inferior cerebellar peduncles. Infarction in this territory classically causes ipsilateral hearing loss (due to cochlear nucleus involvement), facial paralysis, ataxia/tremor (cerebellar peduncle involvement), and sometimes involvement of the facial nerve nucleus. Third nerve palsy itself is not a classic finding in AICA strokes, but the combination of hearing loss and tremor localizes to the AICA distribution, whereas PICA lesions spare hearing. Option B (PICA) infarcts cause Wallenberg syndrome with contralateral body loss of pain and temperature, ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss, dysphagia, hoarseness, ataxia, and nystagmus, but classically spare hearing. No primary literature supports PICA causing hearing loss.","conceptual_foundation":"The vascular territories of the posterior circulation include the PCA, superior cerebellar artery (SCA), AICA, and PICA. The AICA arises from the basilar artery and supplies the lateral pons, middle cerebellar peduncle, flocculus, and cochlear nuclei. Infarction of AICA produces the lateral pontine (Marie\u2013Foix syndrome) with hearing loss, facial weakness, and ataxia. The PICA arises from the vertebral artery and supplies the dorsolateral medulla and inferior cerebellum, leading to lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome without cochlear involvement. The oculomotor nerve nucleus is located in the midbrain supplied by the PCA; PCA aneurysm or infarct causes third nerve palsy, but hearing loss points to AICA. Thus, combined hearing loss and cerebellar signs localize to AICA territory.","pathophysiology":"Normal pontine circulation is maintained by branches of the basilar artery. AICA occlusion leads to ischemia of the lateral pons, including the facial nerve nucleus, cochlear nucleus, vestibular nuclei, and cerebellar peduncles. At the cellular level, ischemia induces failure of ATP-dependent ion pumps, glutamate excitotoxicity, and neuronal death. Lesion of the cochlear nucleus causes ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Damage to the cerebellar peduncle interrupts inhibitory Purkinje cell signaling, manifesting as tremor. The facial nucleus involvement explains any facial weakness. Third nerve fibers are not directly in this territory, but mass effect can rarely involve neighboring cranial nerves.","clinical_manifestation":"AICA strokes present with ipsilateral facial paralysis (65%), ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss (50\u201360%), ataxia/tremor (70%), vertigo, nausea/vomiting, and nystagmus. Facial numbness and decreased corneal reflex may occur. Horner syndrome is uncommon. Prodromal symptoms are rare, and onset is acute over minutes to hours. Untreated, patients risk extension into the basilar artery with life\u2010threatening deficits. Prognosis depends on collateral flow and time to reperfusion.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation includes noncontrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage, followed by MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging to detect pontine infarction (sensitivity >95%). MRA or CTA can identify basilar or AICA occlusion (specificity ~90%). Audiometry confirms cochlear involvement. Carotid and vertebral ultrasound assess proximal stenosis. Echocardiography and ECG evaluate cardioembolic sources. First\u2010tier labs include CBC, glucose, lipids, coagulation panel, and inflammatory markers to rule out vasculitis.","management_principles":"Acute management follows AHA/ASA guidelines (Class I, Level A) for posterior circulation stroke: IV alteplase within 4.5 hours if no contraindications; mechanical thrombectomy for basilar occlusion. Blood pressure should be maintained <185/110 mmHg if receiving thrombolysis. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily), statin therapy (high\u2010intensity), blood pressure control (target <130/80 mmHg), and diabetes management. Vestibular rehabilitation addresses ataxia and tremor symptoms.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow\u2010up MRI at 24\u201348 hours to assess infarct evolution. Regular outpatient visits every 3 months in the first year for vascular risk management. Audiology follow\u2010up if hearing does not recover.

What is the appropriate management?","options":["Aspirin (ASA)","IV thrombolysis","Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT)","Stenting"],"correct_answer":"C","correct_answer_text":"Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT)","subspecialty":"Vascular Neurology/Stroke","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Aspirin monotherapy): Aspirin 81\u2013325 mg daily reduces recurrent noncardioembolic stroke risk by about 22% at 90 days, but in symptomatic high-risk intracranial stenosis (\u226570% MCA narrowing) monotherapy yields higher recurrence (~12%\u201315% at 1 year). It might be chosen for low-risk lacunar infarcts without severe stenosis or bleeding history. However, dual agents show superior prevention in early high-risk contexts.\n\nOption B (IV thrombolysis): IV tPA (0.9 mg/kg) within 4.5 hours is standard for acute ischemic stroke with disabling deficits. In lacunar syndromes without large vessel occlusion it can be beneficial, but with severe symptomatic MCA stenosis and small deep infarcts the risk of hemorrhagic transformation rises to ~7%\u20139%. It does not address subacute secondary prevention.\n\nOption C (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy): DAPT with aspirin 81 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily started within 24 hours and continued for 21\u201390 days reduces stroke recurrence from ~18% to ~6% at 90 days in CHANCE and POINT trials. In symptomatic intracranial stenosis, DAPT for 90 days cuts risk of recurrent TIA/stroke by 35%\u201340%. Pathophysiologically, it inhibits both platelet COX-1 and P2Y12 pathways, stabilizes endothelium, and prevents microthrombi formation. This is definitively correct per AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines.\n\nOption D (Stenting): Intracranial stenting in the SAMMPRIS and VISSIT trials showed a 14%\u201320% 30-day stroke or death rate versus 5% with medical therapy. Indicated only in refractory cases after \u22652 recurrent events despite optimal medical management. Immediate periprocedural risks and in-stent restenosis (~15%) argue against primary stenting in acute symptomatic MCA stenosis. It is not first-line.","conceptual_foundation":"The middle cerebral artery (MCA) originates from the internal carotid artery bifurcation, supplying the lateral frontal, parietal, and superior temporal lobes. Its lenticulostriate branches penetrate to irrigate the internal capsule, basal ganglia, and corona radiata. Embryologically, the circle of Willis arises from paired dorsal aortae and ICAs by week 4; failure of fusion impacts collateral formation. Functionally, the MCA supports primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus) and somatosensory cortex, as well as Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s areas in dominant hemispheres. Lesions produce contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and aphasia or neglect. Key anatomical landmarks include the Sylvian fissure separating frontal and temporal lobes and the insular cortex deep in the operculum, often infarcted in MCA stroke. Historically, Tullio described MCA strokes in the early 19th century; subsequent angiographic developments by Moniz (1927) enabled vessel visualization. Modern CTA and MRA evolved this understanding. Collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomoses between ACA and PCA distributions can salvage penumbral tissue. Clinically, lacunar strokes within small perforators reflect lipohyalinosis from chronic hypertension, while large-artery atheromatous occlusion affects cortical branches. Recognition of symptomatic intracranial stenosis as a high-risk entity emerged in the 1980s with angiography series, informing contemporary management guidelines.","pathophysiology":"Lacunar infarcts arise from lipohyalinosis or microatheroma in small penetrating arterioles, driven by chronic hypertension, diabetes, and endothelial dysfunction. High intraluminal pressure induces fibrinoid necrosis, basement membrane thickening, and deposition of glycosaminoglycans in vessel walls. Platelet activation via thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and P2Y12 signaling causes local microthrombi; dual antiplatelet blockade reduces aggregation. In large vessel MCA stenosis, atherosclerotic plaques harbor macrophages and foam cells secreting interleukin-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and matrix metalloproteinases, promoting plaque rupture. Genetic predispositions include NOTCH3 in CADASIL and MTHFR C677T variant raising homocysteine. Hypoperfusion triggers glutamate release, NMDA receptor\u2013mediated calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species formation, and apoptosis via caspase cascades. Microglial activation releases IL-6 and cyclooxygenase-2, exacerbating inflammation. Penumbra persists for up to 6 hours before irreversible infarction. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation impairs vasodilation. Collateral recruitment via shear stress\u2013induced eNOS helps maintain perfusion but is limited by age and vessel integrity. Post-ischemic angiogenesis mediated by VEGF peaks at day 7\u201314 but often insufficient. These molecular and cellular events underlie acute injury and guide antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective strategies.","clinical_manifestation":"Onset often features sudden contralateral weakness of face and arm with or without leg involvement in MCA territory. Weakness peaks within minutes to hours; sensory loss and mild aphasia in left MCA strokes also appear. NIH Stroke Scale scores range from 2 to 10 in lacunar presentations. In pediatric populations, strokes are rarer but may manifest with headache, seizure, and focal deficits; risk factors include sickle cell disease. Elderly patients present with falls, delirium, or atypical gait instability. Gender differences are subtle but women more often report nonspecific symptoms and may delay presentation. Associated systemic signs include hypertension (BP >180/100 mm Hg) and hyperglycemia. Red flags: rapid deterioration, fluctuating symptoms suggesting branch atheromatous disease, or new onset headache indicating hemorrhagic conversion. Without treatment, recurrent events occur in 15% at 30 days and 25% at one year. Severity grading uses the Modified Rankin Scale for disability and the ABCD2 score for TIA risk. Natural history without intervention involves progressive motor deficits, spasticity developing by two weeks, and secondary complications like aspiration pneumonia and deep venous thrombosis during immobility.","diagnostic_approach":"Initial evaluation follows a stroke code algorithm: noncontrast CT (sensitivity 98% to exclude hemorrhage) within 25 minutes, followed by CTA head and neck to detect vessel stenosis (MCA narrowing \u226570%). MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has >95% sensitivity and >90% specificity for acute infarct within 6 hours. Laboratory workup includes CBC (platelets 150\u2013450 \u00d710^9/L), PT/INR (0.8\u20131.2), aPTT (25\u201335 s), and glucose (70\u2013140 mg/dL). Echocardiogram and ECG rule out cardioembolic sources. Transcranial Doppler can quantify stenosis and microembolic signals. If CTA suggests dissection, MR angiography with fat-saturated T1 sequences detects intramural hematoma. CSF analysis is not routine unless vasculitis is suspected; normal WBC count is <5 cells/mm^3 and protein <45 mg/dL. Electroencephalography helps exclude seizures mimicking stroke. Differential includes intracerebral hemorrhage, migraine aura, Todd paresis, hypoglycemia, and conversion disorder; distinguishing features are CT/MRI findings, capillary glucose, and symptom coherence. The decision tree progresses from hemorrhage exclusion to reperfusion eligibility then to secondary prevention stratified by stenosis severity and infarct size.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for symptomatic high-grade (>70%) intracranial MCA stenosis includes aspirin 81 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily. Loading with clopidogrel 300 mg on day 1 optimizes platelet inhibition; DAPT is continued for 90 days then aspirin monotherapy. Blood pressure management targets <140/90 mm Hg within 24 hours, using labetalol 10\u201320 mg IV bolus or nicardipine infusion at 5 mg/h. Statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg daily) reduces LDL to <70 mg/dL. Second-line options include cilostazol 100 mg twice daily for clopidogrel intolerance. Warfarin is contraindicated outside atrial fibrillation. Surgical endarterectomy is not feasible intracranially; angioplasty plus stenting reserved for recurrent events after two DAPT courses, but periprocedural risk is ~15%. Nonpharmacological interventions include carotid massage avoidance and early mobilization within 24 hours. Monitoring includes platelet function assays (VerifyNow P2Y12 assay) and transcranial Doppler every 3 months. In renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) clopidogrel dose adjustment is unnecessary. In pregnancy, aspirin alone may be considered in the first trimester but DAPT typically withheld until postpartum. Side effects like bleeding (2%\u20133%) require GI prophylaxis with PPIs.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients should have clinic visits at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and every 6 months thereafter for at least one year. Blood pressure, lipid profile, and HbA1c targets (<7.0%) are assessed at each visit. Repeat CTA or MRA at 3 months evaluates stenosis progression; if narrowing increases by >10%, consider alternative interventions. Transcranial Doppler monitoring every 6 months tracks microembolic signals. Long-term complications include cognitive impairment (incidence 30% at one year) and depression (20%). One-year stroke recurrence is approximately 12%, five-year mortality approaches 25%. Early physical therapy begins in first 48 hours, with goal of independent transfers by two weeks and community ambulation by 12 weeks. Patient education emphasizes medication adherence, smoking cessation, salt restriction (<2.3 g/day), and weight management. Driving fitness is assessed at 1 month post-event; return usually allowed at three months if no recurrent episodes. Support resources include American Stroke Association and National Stroke Association for caregiver training and community support.","clinical_pearls":"1. In symptomatic intracranial stenosis \u226570%, DAPT for 90 days reduces recurrent stroke by 40% compared to monotherapy. 2. Lacunar infarcts often spare cortical signs; suspect MCA perforator disease if pure motor deficits exist. 3. The ABCD2 score estimates TIA risk; DAPT usage guided by stroke severity rather than TIA alone. 4. SAMMPRIS trial contraindicated upfront stenting in high-grade stenosis due to 14% periprocedural stroke risk. 5. POINT and CHANCE trials validate early clopidogrel loading (300 mg) plus aspirin reduces 90-day recurrence. 6. Monitor VerifyNow P2Y12 values to detect clopidogrel resistance (~5%\u201310%). 7. Avoid aggressive BP lowering within first 24 hours; maintain MAP to support penumbra. 8. Mnemonic \u201cCLOTS\u201d (Clopidogrel, Lower BP, Omit thrombolysis in small deep infarcts, Target LDL, Surveillance imaging) aids management recall.","references":"1. Chimowitz MI et al.
