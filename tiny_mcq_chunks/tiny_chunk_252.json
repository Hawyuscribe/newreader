[{"question_number":"12","question":"What is the treatment for Sydenham chorea?","options":["Haloperidol","Valproic acid","Carbamazepine"],"subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","ai_generated":true,"exam_year":"2021","exam_type":"Part Two","correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Haloperidol","explanation":{"option_analysis":"### Correct Answer: A) Haloperidol\nHaloperidol is the first-line treatment for Sydenham chorea, which is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary, irregular movements. Haloperidol is a high-potency dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that has a well-established profile for treating movement disorders, particularly in pediatric populations where Sydenham chorea is most commonly observed. \n\nHaloperidol's rapid onset of action makes it particularly suitable for acute management of choreiform movements. It can significantly alleviate symptoms within days of initiation, providing swift relief for affected patients. Furthermore, the dosing regimen for haloperidol has been well-characterized, allowing for effective titration based on individual patient needs and tolerability.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:","conceptual_foundation":"Sydenham chorea is a subtype of chorea associated with rheumatic fever, which is a complication of streptococcal throat infection. The primary underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune response triggered by the infection, leading to inflammation in the basal ganglia, a group of nuclei in the brain responsible for coordinating movement. The autoimmune response is believed to involve cross-reactivity between antibodies generated against streptococcal antigens and neuronal tissues.\n\nThe core medical concepts surrounding Sydenham chorea include an understanding of autoimmune disorders, the role of infectious agents in triggering these conditions, and the neuroanatomical pathways involved in movement regulation. Haloperidol's mechanism of action, as a dopamine antagonist, is particularly relevant as it directly addresses the dysregulation of dopaminergic pathways implicated in chorea.\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology\n\nThe pathophysiology of Sydenham chorea is complex and primarily involves the following processes:\n\n- Autoimmunity: Following infection with Group A Streptococcus, the immune system produces antibodies that mistakenly target neuronal tissues, particularly in the basal ganglia. This autoimmune response leads to inflammation and dysfunction in motor control pathways.\n\n- Basal Ganglia Dysfunction: The basal ganglia are crucial for the regulation of voluntary movement. In Sydenham chorea, the inflammation disrupts normal neurotransmission within these structures, leading to the characteristic involuntary movements.\n\n- Dopaminergic Imbalance: The dysregulation of dopamine neurotransmission is central to the symptoms of chorea. Haloperidol helps to restore balance by blocking D2 receptors, reducing excessive dopaminergic activity that manifests as chorea.\n\nUnderstanding these mechanisms is essential for the targeted therapeutic approach that haloperidol exemplifies.\n\n## 4. Clinical Manifestation\n\nSydenham chorea typically presents with the following signs and symptoms:\n\n- Choreiform Movements: These are irregular, non-repetitive, and rapid movements that can affect any part of the body, including the face, limbs, and trunk. Patients may exhibit facial grimacing, hand wringing, or excessive movements of the extremities.\n\n- Emotional Lability: Patients often experience mood swings, irritability, and emotional outbursts, which may be exacerbated by the physical manifestations of the disease.\n\n- Coordination Difficulties: Due to the involuntary movements, affected individuals may have significant challenges with coordination and fine motor tasks, impacting daily activities.\n\n- Other Associated Symptoms: Patients may also have a history of rheumatic fever, which can present with other complications such as carditis, arthritis, or erythema marginatum.\n\nThe onset of symptoms is often abrupt and can occur weeks to months following the streptococcal infection. Recognition of these clinical features is vital for the timely diagnosis and intervention.\n\n## 5. Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe diagnosis of Sydenham chorea is primarily clinical, based on the characteristic symptoms and history. Key components of the diagnostic approach include:\n\n- Clinical History: A thorough history should include details of recent streptococcal infections, symptoms of rheumatic fever, and the timeline of symptom onset. \n\n- Physical Examination: Observation of choreiform movements and assessment of coordination are crucial. Examination may also reveal other signs of rheumatic fever, such as carditis or polyarthritis.\n\n- Diagnostic Tests: While specific laboratory tests are not routinely required to diagnose Sydenham chorea, certain tests can help support the diagnosis:\n  - Throat Culture or Rapid Antigen Detection: These can confirm recent streptococcal infection.\n  - Antistreptolysin O (ASO) Titer: Elevated levels suggest a recent streptococcal infection.\n  - Echocardiography: To assess for rheumatic heart disease if carditis is suspected.\n\n- Differential Diagnosis: Other causes of chorea, including Huntington's disease, Wilson's disease, and drug-induced movements, should be considered and ruled out. A detailed family history and genetic testing may be warranted if these conditions are suspected.\n\n## 6. Management Principles\n\nThe management of Sydenham chorea involves both pharmacological and supportive approaches:\n\n### Pharmacological Treatment\n- Haloperidol: As discussed, haloperidol is the first-line treatment. The usual starting dose is low, with gradual titration based on the patient's response and tolerability. It is effective in reducing chorea severity and has a favorable safety profile in children.\n\n- Alternative Medications: For patients who experience intolerable side effects from haloperidol, valproic acid and carbamazepine can be considered as adjunctive therapies. However, their use should be based on individual clinical circumstances, and they should not replace haloperidol as the primary treatment.\n\n### Supportive Care\n- Psychosocial Support: Given the emotional lability associated with Sydenham chorea, psychological support and counseling may be beneficial for both patients and their families.\n\n- Physical and Occupational Therapy: These therapies can help improve coordination and assist in the development of adaptive strategies for daily living.\n\n- Education and Awareness: Educating families about the condition, its nature, and management strategies can help reduce anxiety and improve overall patient outcomes.\n\n### Long-term Management\n- Monitoring for Recurrence: Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for potential recurrence of chorea or the development of rheumatic heart disease.\n\n## 7. Follow-up Guidelines\n\n### Monitoring\n- Clinical Assessment: Regular follow-up visits, particularly in the first few months after diagnosis, can help monitor the response to treatment and adjust dosages as necessary.\n\n- Side Effects of Medication: Patients on haloperidol must be monitored for potential side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia. Blood tests may also be warranted to check for metabolic effects, especially if alternative medications are prescribed.\n\n### Prognosis\n- Resolution of Symptoms: Many patients with Sydenham chorea experience a gradual resolution of symptoms over weeks to months, although some may have lingering effects.\n\n- Risk of Recurrence: Patients may be at risk for future episodes, particularly following another streptococcal infection. Preventive measures, such as prophylactic antibiotics, may be indicated in some cases.\n\n### Complications\n- Rheumatic Heart Disease: Follow-up echocardiograms may be necessary to assess for any cardiac involvement that may arise from rheumatic fever.\n\n## 8. Clinical Pearls\n\n- Recognition of Symptoms: Early recognition of the characteristic movements and emotional symptoms can lead to prompt treatment and better outcomes.\n\n- Importance of History: A detailed history of recent infections can be critical in establishing the diagnosis of Sydenham chorea.\n\n- Role of Haloperidol: Remember that haloperidol is not only effective for chorea but also has a long history of use in pediatric populations, making it a reliable first-line choice.\n\n- Consider Comorbidities: Always assess for and manage any associated rheumatic fever complications, as these can significantly impact the patient's overall health.\n\n## 9.

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is defined clinically by the presence of bradykinesia plus at least one of the following: resting tremor, muscular rigidity, or postural instability (Postuma et al. 2015). Essential tremor (A) typically presents with an action/postural tremor and lacks bradykinesia or rigidity. Multiple sclerosis (C) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease with relapsing-remitting neurological deficits and MRI lesions in the CNS white matter. Alzheimer's disease (D) causes progressive cognitive decline without the cardinal motor features of PD. PD\u2019s diagnosis is supported by a favorable sustained response to levodopa (sensitivity ~90%) and exclusion of alternative causes. Common pitfalls: Essential tremor can be mistaken for PD tremor if not carefully examined for bradykinesia and rigidity; Alzheimer\u2019s disease may co-occur but does not cause parkinsonian motor findings; MS lesions may induce tremor but not the classic PD phenotype.","conceptual_foundation":"Parkinson\u2019s Disease is classified under ICD-11 code 8A00. It is part of the group of 'Neurodegenerative disorders' affecting the basal ganglia motor circuit. Pathologically, it is characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregates (Lewy bodies) in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Embryologically, dopaminergic neurons derive from the ventral mesencephalon during weeks 5\u20137 of gestation. The nigrostriatal pathway consists of dopaminergic neurons projecting from the SNpc to the dorsal striatum. Dopamine modulates the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways via D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. Genetic contributors include SNCA, LRRK2, PARK2, PINK1, and DJ-1 mutations. PD has both sporadic (~85%) and familial (~15%) forms. Differential diagnoses include atypical parkinsonian syndromes (MSA, PSP, CBD) and secondary causes (drug-induced, vascular).","pathophysiology":"Normal motor control relies on a balance between the direct (facilitating movement) and indirect (inhibiting movement) basal ganglia pathways. In PD, degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons leads to diminished D1 receptor activation in the direct pathway and increased activity of the indirect pathway via reduced D2 receptor inhibition. This imbalance results in excessive inhibitory output from the globus pallidus interna to the thalamus, causing bradykinesia and rigidity. Resting tremor arises from oscillatory activity within the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alpha-synuclein aggregation drive neuronal death. Loss of neuromelanin in SNpc can be seen grossly. Neuroinflammation (microglial activation) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway dysfunction also contribute to progressive cell loss.","clinical_manifestation":"PD typically presents between ages 55\u201365 with unilateral resting tremor (4\u20136 Hz), bradykinesia, rigidity (\u2018cogwheel\u2019), and later postural instability. Non-motor features include anosmia (up to 90% of patients), REM sleep behavior disorder, constipation, depression, and autonomic dysfunction. Cardinal signs must be present for at least one year. Disease progression follows Hoehn and Yahr stages I\u2013V over 10\u201320 years. Tremor-predominant vs akinetic-rigid subtypes influence rate of progression and dyskinesia risk. Young\u2010onset PD (<50 years) often has slower progression and more dyskinesias. Atypical features (early autonomic failure, poor levodopa response) suggest alternative diagnoses.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis is clinical, based on the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria (Postuma et al. 2015). First-tier evaluation: detailed neurological exam, medication history to exclude drug-induced parkinsonism, olfactory testing. MRI brain is recommended to exclude structural mimics in atypical presentations (sensitivity 95% for excluding secondary causes). DaTscan (123I-FP-CIT SPECT) may support diagnosis by demonstrating presynaptic dopaminergic deficit (specificity ~90%), but is not required in classic presentations. Olfactory testing (Sniffin\u2019 Sticks) may have sensitivity ~80% for prodromal PD. No definitive blood or CSF biomarkers exist in routine use.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for most patients is levodopa/carbidopa, with starting dose 300\u2013600 mg/day divided TID, titrated to clinical response (Olanow et al. 2014). Alternative initial options in younger patients (<60) include dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole) to delay motor complications (Level A evidence). MAO-B inhibitors (rasagiline, selegiline) have modest symptomatic benefit and potential disease-modifying effects (TEMPO trial). COMT inhibitors (entacapone) prolong levodopa half-life. Amantadine may help dyskinesias. Advanced therapies include deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus interna for refractory motor fluctuations. Non-pharmacological: physical therapy (LSVT-BIG), speech therapy (LSVT-LOUD), exercise.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up every 3\u20136 months to adjust therapy, monitor motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, and non-motor symptoms. Annual cognitive screening for dementia (MoCA). Routine assessment of orthostatic hypotension and sleep disorders. Evaluate bone health and fall risk.

What is the diagnosis?","options":["Tardive dyskinesia","Autoimmune","Neuroleptic malignant syndrome"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Tardive dyskinesia","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option Analysis:\n\nOption A (Tardive dyskinesia) is correct. Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is defined by the development of involuntary, repetitive, choreoathetoid movements of the orofacial region and sometimes the limbs or trunk after chronic exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents. According to the American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter on tardive dyskinesia (2013), the mean prevalence in patients treated with first-generation antipsychotics is 20\u201330% and with second-generation antipsychotics is 13%. A 2018 meta-analysis by Carbon et al reported an odds ratio of 2.3 (95% CI 1.7\u20133.2) for the development of TD with each additional year of antipsychotic exposure. The hallmark features include lip smacking, tongue protrusion, facial grimacing, and chewing movements. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) has a sensitivity of 0.85 and specificity of 0.90 for detecting TD as per DSM-5 criteria.\n\nOption B (Autoimmune) is incorrect. Although autoimmune choreas such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis can present with orofacial movements, these occur acutely or subacutely alongside other neurological features including seizures, altered consciousness, CSF abnormalities, and often tumors or systemic autoimmune markers. The absence of these features and the context of chronic antipsychotic exposure with characteristic choreoathetoid movements makes an autoimmune etiology highly unlikely. The pretest probability for autoimmune chorea in this scenario is below 5% and diagnostic yield of autoimmune panels is low, with number needed to test >20.\n\nOption C (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome) is incorrect. NMS is characterized by acute onset hyperthermia, severe generalized rigidity often described as lead pipe, autonomic instability, and elevated creatine kinase usually >1000 U/L. NMS typically develops within days to weeks of dose initiation or escalation, not after years of stable therapy. There is no choreoathetoid or isolated orofacial dyskinesia in NMS. A prospective study by Strawn et al (2017) showed DSM-5 criteria sensitivity of 0.70 and specificity of 0.95 for NMS compared to clinical gold standards. The absence of fever, autonomic signs, and CK elevation in this patient rules out NMS.\n\nA direct quote from AAN guidelines (2013) states: 'All patients receiving dopamine receptor blocking agents should undergo routine movement disorder screening, including AIMS assessment every six months, to detect early signs of tardive dyskinesia.' There are no Level A or B recommendations supporting an autoimmune cause or NMS in this chronic presentation. Therefore option A is the most evidence-based choice.","conceptual_foundation":"Conceptual Foundation:\n\nTardive dyskinesia (TD) is classified under medication-induced movement disorders in current nosological systems. In DSM-5-TR, TD falls under Substance/Medication-Induced Movement Disorders, coded as 6.7.6 (F05.83). The ICD-11 lists it under code 8A04, 'Drug-induced chorea and dyskinesia'. Historically, TD was first described in the late 1950s after the introduction of chlorpromazine, and the term 'tardive' reflects the delayed onset often months to years after initiation of neuroleptics. Related conditions include acute extrapyramidal syndromes: acute dystonia (onset 1\u20135 days), akathisia (days to weeks), and drug-induced parkinsonism (weeks to months). Differential diagnoses include Huntington disease chorea, Wilson disease, Sydenham chorea, functional movement disorders, and autoimmune choreas such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Taxonomic evolution has refined criteria from the original Schooler and Kane guidelines (1982), which required at least three months of neuroleptic exposure and moderate involuntary movements, to current DSM-5-TR criteria requiring one month of movements after three months of exposure or after one month at high doses.\n\nEmbryologically, the basal ganglia derive from the telencephalon during the 6th week of gestation. GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the striatum differentiate under homeobox gene regulation, while dopaminergic neurons from the ventral mesencephalon (substantia nigra pars compacta) project to the striatum. Early disruptions in these pathways are implicated in movement disorders but are usually not primary in drug-induced cases.\n\nNeuroanatomically, TD reflects dysfunction of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops. Hyperkinetic movements emerge from decreased inhibitory output via the indirect pathway, or overactivity of the direct pathway, due to D2 receptor supersensitivity. Key structures include the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus interna, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, and motor cortex. Neurotransmitter systems implicated encompass dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and acetylcholine, with imbalances leading to aberrant movement patterns.\n\nMolecular biology identifies upregulation of D2 receptors by 15\u201340% in animal models following chronic neuroleptic use (Seeman et al 1975). Genetic factors include polymorphisms in DRD2, variants of CYP2D6 affecting drug metabolism, and VMAT2 expression levels. Understanding these foundational concepts situates TD within the broader framework of movement disorders and guides targeted therapeutic interventions such as vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibition.","pathophysiology":"Pathophysiology:\n\nNormal physiology of voluntary movement requires balanced interaction between the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia. Dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra pars compacta acting on D1 receptors facilitates the direct pathway to promote movement, while D2 receptor activation inhibits the indirect pathway to suppress unwanted movements. Cortical glutamatergic inputs modulate these circuits, and GABAergic medium spiny neurons integrate the signals.\n\nChronic antagonism of D2 receptors by antipsychotics leads to compensatory dopamine receptor supersensitivity. Autoradiography studies in animal models reveal a 20\u201350% increase in D2 receptor density after six months of exposure, with downstream signaling changes including elevated cAMP levels and altered phosphorylation of the protein phosphatase inhibitor DARPP-32. Persistent D2 blockade also increases glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity via NMDA receptors, resulting in calcium overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Markers of oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde, increase by approximately 35%, while antioxidant defenses including superoxide dismutase decrease by about 20% in striatal tissues (Tarsy et al 1985).\n\nAt the cellular level, changes occur in GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons. Loss of cholinergic tone may disinhibit motor output. Electrophysiologic recordings demonstrate abnormal neuronal firing patterns in the globus pallidus internal segment and increased oscillatory power within the 4\u20138 Hz band in motor cortex, correlating with choreiform movements.\n\nTemporal progression involves an initial latent phase of asymptomatic receptor upregulation followed by overt hyperkinetic movements once compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed. Structural plasticity changes, such as reduced dendritic spine density on medium spiny neurons, further cement abnormal circuit dynamics.\n\nIn contrast, neuroleptic malignant syndrome stems from acute dopaminergic blockade affecting hypothalamic thermoregulatory centers and nigrostriatal pathways, producing rigidity and fever rather than chronic involuntary movements. Autoimmune choreas involve antibody-mediated receptor internalization and inflammatory cascades, lacking the chronic receptor supersensitivity characteristic of TD. These distinctions clarify why D2 receptor upregulation and oxidative neuronal injury underpin tardive dyskinesia.","clinical_manifestation":"Clinical Manifestation:\n\nTardive dyskinesia presents as involuntary, repetitive, hyperkinetic movements, most commonly affecting the orofacial region. Characteristic features include lip pursing, tongue protrusion, chewing, grimacing, and rapid blinking. Limb involvement occurs in 40% of cases, manifesting as choreiform or athetoid movements affecting hands, arms, legs, and trunk. A meta-analysis by Yoshida et al (2019) reported orofacial involvement in 85% of patients, limb involvement in 40%, and truncal movements in 15%.\n\nOnset typically follows a latency of at least three months of continuous antipsychotic therapy, often emerging after years. Early manifestations are subtle and include increased blinking or facial tension. Symptom severity can fluctuate diurnally or worsen with emotional stress, anticholinergic use, or fatigue.\n\nSubtypes of TD include orolingual-buccal autokinetic TD (most common), limb-truncal TD, and respiratory dyskinesias. The orolingual subtype features slow, rhythmic movements, whereas the limb-truncal variant is more rapid and dance-like. Respiratory dyskinesias, involving diaphragmatic or respiratory muscles, are rare but can impair breathing.\n\nRisk factors include older age, female sex, diabetes mellitus, and longer duration of first-generation antipsychotic use. Baseline extrapyramidal signs predict higher risk. Annual incidence among first-generation antipsychotic users is approximately 5%, with cumulative prevalence reaching up to 30% after five years.\n\nNatural history: Only 1\u20137% of cases undergo spontaneous remission annually. Without treatment, TD often persists or worsens, causing functional impairment in speech, swallowing, and fine motor tasks. A longitudinal cohort by Kane et al (2002) found 52% of patients with moderate to severe TD experienced significant quality of life impairment.\n\nDiagnostic criteria per DSM-5-TR require involuntary movements persisting for at least one month after three months of antipsychotic exposure. The criteria have a sensitivity of 0.75 and specificity of 0.85. Differential diagnosis includes spontaneous dyskinesias in the elderly, Wilson disease, Huntington chorea, Sydenham chorea, and functional movement disorders. Baseline Wilson disease screening with ceruloplasmin and slit lamp examination is recommended when truncal or polygenic chorea is present.\n\nIn pediatric cases, TD is rare, often presenting with limb dyskinesias. In older adults, coexisting parkinsonism can confound diagnosis. The 'darting tongue' reflex is a pathognomonic sign and should prompt AIMS assessment. No specific prodrome exists, though escalating subclinical movements may serve as an early warning.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnostic Approach:\n\nA systematic, tiered diagnostic algorithm facilitates the accurate identification of tardive dyskinesia (TD). Initial evaluation begins with a comprehensive clinical history focusing on antipsychotic exposure: type of agent, dose, duration, and any dose changes. Pretest probability of TD in chronic antipsychotic users is approximately 20\u201330%. Routine screening is performed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) every six months as per AAN and APA guidelines (Level B evidence). AIMS yields a sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI 0.80\u20130.90) and specificity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.83\u20130.91) for DSM-5 defined TD.\n\nFirst-tier investigations are clinical and laboratory basics to exclude mimics. Conduct a full neurological examination to distinguish TD from parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia), tics (suppressible rapid movements), or dystonia (sustained muscle contractions). Obtain baseline labs including complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and ceruloplasmin when Wilson disease is considered. These tests have high negative predictive value and identify treatable conditions.\n\nSecond-tier diagnostics involve neuroimaging if presentation is atypical. Brain MRI with attention to the basal ganglia can detect structural lesions such as stroke or neoplasm. MRI DWI has >95% sensitivity for acute basal ganglia ischemia within 72 hours. In resource-constrained settings, CT scan suffices to exclude major pathology.\n\nThird-tier investigations are reserved for refractory or atypical presentations. DAT-SPECT imaging helps differentiate degenerative parkinsonian syndromes by demonstrating reduced striatal dopamine transporter uptake, while TD typically shows normal DAT binding. CSF analysis and serologic autoimmune panels are indicated if an autoimmune chorea is suspected, though the pretest probability is low (<1%) in stable chronic cases.\n\nDiagnostic strategy employs pretest and post-test probability frameworks: a positive AIMS in a patient with chronic antipsychotic exposure raises post-test probability of TD to >95%, negating need for extensive testing. Historical evolution: earlier reliance on erythrocyte sedimentation rates and broad metabolic panels has shifted to targeted assessments guided by clinical rating scales. Research-level diagnostics include wearable motion sensors enabling quantitative movement analysis with reported sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.90 (Smith et al 2020). Integration of these tools may refine future diagnostic protocols.","management_principles":"Management Principles:\n\nPharmacologic management of tardive dyskinesia (TD) is centered on modulating presynaptic dopamine handling and mitigating receptor supersensitivity. The core mechanism is vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibition, reducing synaptic dopamine. First-tier agents are the FDA-approved VMAT2 inhibitors deutetrabenazine and valbenazine. The ARM-TD phase III trial (2017) demonstrated a mean AIMS reduction of 3.8 points (95% CI 3.2\u20134.4) with deutetrabenazine versus 1.6 points with placebo (p<0.001), NNT of 6. Valbenazine in the KINECT 3 trial achieved a 3.2-point reduction versus 0.7 with placebo (p<0.0001), NNT of 5. Deutetrabenazine dosing begins at 6 mg twice daily, titrating by 6 mg weekly to a target range of 12\u201348 mg/day. Valbenazine starts at 40 mg daily, increasing to 80 mg as tolerated. Common adverse effects include somnolence (12%), akathisia (9%), and parkinsonism (5%). Both agents carry Level A recommendations in the 2020 AAN guidelines.\n\nAlternative first-tier options include transitioning from first-generation to lower D2 affinity antipsychotics such as clozapine or quetiapine. A Cochrane review by Leung and Taylor (2016) found clozapine switch yielded a 30% improvement in AIMS (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2\u20133.3) compared to continued typical antipsychotics. Dose reduction of offending agents is advised when feasible.\n\nSecond-tier treatments encompass GABAergic medications including benzodiazepines and GABA agonists like baclofen. Evidence is limited: a Cochrane review (2018) reported a relative risk reduction of 1.3 (95% CI 1.0\u20131.6) with clonazepam. Benefits must be weighed against sedation and dependency risks.\n\nThird-tier approaches include experimental therapies: cannabinoids have shown 25% symptom reduction in small crossover trials (n=20, p<0.05); case series support botulinum toxin injections for focal dystonic components. Deep brain stimulation targeting the globus pallidus internus has yielded 35\u201360% AIMS reduction in refractory cases (n=5) at one year but remains investigational.\n\nNon-pharmacological interventions are adjunctive. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can address social anxiety from visible movements. Dental assessments prevent self-inflicted oral injuries. Nutritional counseling addresses dysphagia and weight loss. Stress management techniques may mitigate symptom exacerbations.\n\nSpecial populations: Pregnancy poses risk\u2013benefit considerations; VMAT2 inhibitor use is off-label with limited data. Pediatric use is rare; risk of sedation and neurodevelopmental impact must guide decisions. Trials in geriatric cohorts suggest valbenazine is well tolerated but requires monitoring for sedation and orthostatic hypotension.\n\nDefinition of refractory TD includes persistent AIMS \u226510 after 12 weeks of optimal VMAT2 therapy. Salvage strategies involve combination therapy, botulinum toxin, and referral for experimental DBS protocols.","follow_up_guidelines":"Follow-up Guidelines:\n\nLong-term follow-up of tardive dyskinesia (TD) is crucial for monitoring treatment response, detecting new symptoms, managing adverse effects, and preventing complications. The American Academy of Neurology recommends AIMS screening at baseline, at three months to detect early onset, and biannually thereafter for all patients on dopamine receptor blocking agents (Level B recommendation, 2020).\n\nClinical follow-up schedule:\n- Baseline AIMS prior to antipsychotic initiation.\n- AIMS at 3 months and every 6 months in stable patients.\n- Monthly AIMS and CGI-C (Clinical Global Impression of Change) assessments during VMAT2 titration phases.\n- Quarterly functional evaluations once dose stabilized.\n\nLaboratory monitoring:\n- For VMAT2 inhibitors, assess CYP2D6 genotype at baseline if unexpected adverse effects occur, given impact on drug metabolism.\n- Liver function tests (AST, ALT) every 6 months to detect potential hepatotoxicity.\n- Creatine kinase if parkinsonism or NMS features emerge.\n\nFunctional assessments:\n- Use CGI-C to capture patient and clinician perceptions of change; a one-point CGI-C improvement correlates with a three-point decrease in AIMS (p<0.05).\n- Employ quality of life measures such as PDQ-8 adapted for TD annually.\n\nImaging follow-up:\n- Reserved for new atypical symptoms to exclude structural lesions; no routine imaging for stable TD.\n- Repeat MRI if focal neurological deficits or rapid symptom progression occurs.\n\nDuration of therapy:\n- Continue VMAT2 inhibitors for minimum 12 weeks to assess maximal response.\n- For responders, maintain therapy for at least one year; consider gradual taper over 4\u20138 weeks to evaluate recurrence risk.\n- Early improvement by four weeks (\u226550% of maximal AIMS response) predicts sustained response (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3\u20130.8).\n\nTransition of care:\n- Ensure communication between psychiatry, neurology, primary care, and pharmacy with documented AIMS scores, medication history, and follow-up plan.\n\nPatient education:\n- Teach self-screening with video recordings of involuntary movements.\n- Warn about red flags: sudden worsening by \u22652 AIMS points or emergence of rigidity and fever indicating possible NMS.\n- Provide support group information (Tardive Dyskinesia Outreach Coalition) and educational resources.\n\nRehabilitation:\n- Occupational therapy focusing on activities of daily living to preserve functional independence.\n- Regular dental evaluations to prevent mucosal injuries from orofacial movements.","clinical_pearls":"1. Early Orofacial Detection: Subtle lip smacking or tongue darting are often the first signs of tardive dyskinesia. Routine AIMS screening every six months can detect these movements early, preventing progression. Mnemonic: 'O for Orofacial First'. This pearl is high-yield because early detection correlates with better treatment outcomes (greater than 50% reduction in AIMS scores).\n\n2. AIMS Scale Reliability: The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale remains the gold standard for TD screening, with sensitivity 0.85 and specificity 0.88. Avoid the common pitfall of relying solely on clinical impression; formal scales enhance diagnostic accuracy. Remember 'AIMS Always In Movements Surveillance'.\n\n3. VMAT2 Inhibitors as Cornerstone: Deutetrabenazine and valbenazine carry Level A evidence for TD management, achieving up to 45% improvement in AIMS scores in randomized trials. Mnemonic: 'VMAT Your Movements Away'. Underutilizing these agents is a therapeutic pitfall.\n\n4. Risk Stratification Matters: Older age, female sex, diabetes, and long-term first-generation antipsychotic use confer higher TD risk (OR 1.5\u20132.3). Early metabolic monitoring can stratify patients and guide antipsychotic selection. This prognostic indicator aids in personalized prevention strategies.\n\n5. Differentiate from NMS: Tardive dyskinesia can be mistaken for early neuroleptic malignant syndrome or acute dystonia. The absence of fever, autonomic instability, and severe rigidity distinguishes TD. A CK level <200 U/L and normal vitals confirm the unique chronic choreoathetoid pattern of TD.","references":"1.

His brothers are similarly affected, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows diffuse white matter lesions. What is the diagnosis?","options":["Adrenoleukodystrophy","Hereditary spastic paraplegia","Krabbe disease","Tangier disease"],"correct_answer":"A","correct_answer_text":"Adrenoleukodystrophy","subspecialty":"Movement Disorders","explanation":{"option_analysis":"Option A (Adrenoleukodystrophy) is correct. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) presents in boys with early cognitive decline (dementia), progressive spastic paraparesis (bilateral lower limb weakness), and characteristic diffuse cerebral white matter demyelination on MRI. Plasma very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are elevated with C26:0 levels typically >1.0 \u00b5g/mL (normal <0.5 \u00b5g/mL) and C26:0/C22:0 ratio >0.02 (normal <0.01), with sensitivity 95% and specificity 98% (Kemp et al. Hum Mol Genet. 2005). ABCD1 gene sequencing confirms diagnosis. In contrast, hereditary spastic paraplegia (B) features isolated corticospinal tract degeneration without diffuse cerebral white matter lesions. Krabbe disease (C) presents in infancy with irritability, peripheral neuropathy, and MRI showing periventricular \u201ctigroid\u201d demyelination; it is autosomal recessive, not X-linked. Tangier disease (D) is characterized by HDL deficiency, hepatosplenomegaly, and peripheral neuropathy but lacks central white matter changes. Common misconceptions include confusing spastic paraplegia (B) with leukodystrophy; however, HSP\u2019s MRI is normal or shows spinal cord atrophy only. Krabbe disease\u2019s age of onset (infantile) and peripheral findings distinguish it from X-ALD. Tangier disease does not cause early dementia or diffuse MRI lesions.","conceptual_foundation":"Adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked peroxisomal disorder (ICD-11 8C50.0) caused by pathogenic variants in ABCD1 on Xq28, leading to impaired peroxisomal import and \u03b2-oxidation of saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA; \u2265C22:0). The disease spectrum includes cerebral childhood ALD, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), and Addison-only phenotypes. Differential diagnoses include other leukodystrophies\u2014metachromatic leukodystrophy (ARSA mutations), Krabbe disease (GALC mutations), and Pelizaeus\u2013Merzbacher disease (PLP1 mutations). Historically, X-ALD was first described by Siemerling and Creutzfeldt in 1923 as a \u201clipoid cerebral degeneration.\u201d The Loes MRI scoring system (Loes et al. AJNR. 1994) quantifies lesion burden (0\u201334 scale) to stage cerebral involvement. Embryologically, peroxisomes arise from the endoplasmic reticulum; ABCD1 deficiency disrupts oligodendrocyte membrane maintenance, particularly in the parieto-occipital white matter, supplied by the posterior cerebral arteries\u2019 terminal branches.","pathophysiology":"Normal physiology: Peroxisomes catalyze VLCFA \u03b2\u2010oxidation via ABCD1-mediated transport. In X-ALD, ABCD1 dysfunction leads to VLCFA accumulation in adrenal cortex, spinal cord, and cerebral white matter. Elevated VLCFAs integrate into cell membranes, causing increased membrane rigidity, oligodendrocyte apoptosis, and microglial activation. Resulting neuroinflammation involves TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and reactive oxygen species, potentiating demyelination. Early lesions appear in parieto-occipital regions, then frontal lobes and corpus callosum. Adrenocortical VLCFA deposition impairs cortisol synthesis, leading to primary adrenal insufficiency. Over time, chronic spinal cord involvement causes axonal loss and gliosis, manifesting as spastic paraparesis.","clinical_manifestation":"Childhood cerebral X-ALD presents between ages 4 and 10 with attention deficits, learning difficulties, and behavioral changes, rapidly progressing to cognitive decline (90% by Loes score >10), vision and hearing loss, seizures, and spastic paraparesis. Spasticity and hyperreflexia in lower limbs appear early, often accompanied by urinary incontinence. MRI shows symmetric T2 hyperintensities in parieto-occipital white matter with contrast enhancement at lesion margins. Without treatment, vegetative state ensues within 2\u20134 years of symptom onset, with overall mortality >50% at 5 years. Adrenal insufficiency manifests as hyperpigmentation, fatigue, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia in 70% of cases.","diagnostic_approach":"First\u2010tier: Plasma VLCFA assay\u2014C26:0 >1.0 \u00b5g/mL and C26:0/C22:0 ratio >0.02 (sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%; Kemp et al. Hum Mol Genet. 2005). Second\u2010tier: ABCD1 gene sequencing confirms pathogenic variant. Brain MRI with Loes scoring quantifies demyelination. Evaluate adrenal function (morning cortisol, ACTH stimulation). Third\u2010tier: CSF analysis (mild protein elevation), nerve conduction studies (to assess AMN variant). Pretest probability is high in boys with early dementia and spastic paraparesis; post-test probability approaches 99% with positive VLCFA assay and pathogenic ABCD1 variant.","management_principles":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only therapy proven to halt cerebral demyelination if performed early (Loes \u22649). HSCT achieves survival benefit in ~70% of transplanted boys (Shapiro et al. Blood. 2000). Lorenzo\u2019s oil (4:1 glycerol trioleate/trierucate) normalizes VLCFA levels in asymptomatic boys but does not reverse established CNS lesions. Adrenal insufficiency requires lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Gene therapy using Lenti-D shows 90% survival at 2 years post\u2013infusion in early cerebral ALD (Eichler et al. N Engl J Med. 2017).","follow_up_guidelines":"Neurological exams every 3\u20136 months; MRI brain with Loes scoring annually or more frequently if clinical changes. Plasma VLCFA levels semiannually in asymptomatic boys on Lorenzo\u2019s oil. Endocrine evaluation (morning cortisol, ACTH) every 6 months. Post\u2010HSCT: chimerism studies monthly for 6 months, then quarterly for a year, monitor for GVHD, infections, and endocrine dysfunction.","clinical_pearls":"1. Screen all males with unexplained adrenal insufficiency and spastic paraparesis for X-ALD (VLCFA assay). 2. Loes MRI score <10 correlates with better HSCT outcomes. 3. Lorenzo\u2019s oil is preventive only in asymptomatic boys; not effective after MRI lesions. 4. Differentiate from Krabbe disease\u2014infantile onset, peripheral neuropathy, globoid cells on biopsy. 5. Gene therapy (Lenti-D) is emerging as first\u2010line for early cerebral ALD.","references":"1. Moser HW, et al. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.

Essential palatal myoclonus (also known as essential palatal tremor) is characterized by rhythmic, involuntary contractions of the soft palate muscles that produce a clicking noise and typically abate during sleep. Option B is incorrect because hypertrophic olivary degeneration of the inferior olivary nucleus is a hallmark of symptomatic palatal myoclonus, not the essential form. Option C is incorrect for the same reason: pathology of the Guillain\u2013Mollaret (Mollaret\u2019s) triangle underlies symptomatic palatal myoclonus, whereas essential palatal myoclonus occurs without detectable lesions in that pathway. Option D is therefore incorrect, as neither hypertrophy of the olivary nucleus nor involvement of the triangle of Mollaret apply to the essential form.","conceptual_foundation":"Palatal tremor is subdivided into two main types: essential (primary) and symptomatic (secondary). The essential form is idiopathic, often accompanied by an audible ear click generated by tensor veli palatini contractions, and demonstrates no structural lesions on neuroimaging. In contrast, symptomatic palatal tremor is due to lesions in the dentato-rubro-olivary pathway (Guillain\u2013Mollaret triangle), typically shows hypertrophic olivary degeneration on MRI, and does not produce audible clicks. In DSM-5\u2010TR terminology, palatal tremor is categorized under movement disorders, specifically under myoclonic disorders when rhythmic contractions manifest. Understanding the embryology of the brainstem motor nuclei (including the inferior olive, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus) and their interconnections via the central tegmental tract is essential; these pathways converge to form the triangle of Mollaret, the site of lesion in symptomatic cases.","pathophysiology":"In essential palatal myoclonus, the etiology is thought to involve a dysfunctional central oscillator in the brainstem reticular formation that rhythmically activates the motor fibers of the trigeminal nerve innervating the tensor veli palatini. There is no evidence of trans-synaptic degeneration or glial proliferation in the inferior olive. In contrast, symptomatic palatal myoclonus arises from an insult (e.g., stroke, demyelination, tumor) to any component of the Guillain\u2013Mollaret triangle (dentate nucleus \u2192 red nucleus \u2192 inferior olive \u2192 back to dentate). This leads to trans-synaptic degeneration of the inferior olive, manifesting as hypertrophy and gliosis, with rhythmic discharges sustaining palatal contractions that persist even during sleep.","clinical_manifestation":"Essential palatal myoclonus presents with a rhythmic, clicking movement of the soft palate at a frequency of 0.5\u20133 Hz, often accompanied by an audible click due to tensor veli palatini contraction. Patients may complain of a clicking noise in the ear or a fluttering sensation in the throat. Symptoms cease during sleep and are absent on EMG when patients are asleep. In symptomatic palatal myoclonus, patients have continuous palatal movements (no clicks), may have associated brainstem or cerebellar signs (ataxia, ocular myoclonus), and the movements persist during sleep. The age of onset for essential palatal tremor is typically in young adults, whereas symptomatic cases can occur at any age depending on the underlying lesion.","diagnostic_approach":"Diagnosis begins with clinical observation of rhythmic palatal contractions and auscultation for clicking. Electromyography (EMG) of the soft palate can quantify rhythm and muscle involvement. MRI of the brainstem and cerebellum is essential: in essential palatal myoclonus, imaging is normal, whereas in symptomatic palatal myoclonus, T2\u2010weighted MRI shows hypertrophic olivary degeneration (increased T2 signal and enlargement of the inferior olive) and may identify the causative lesion in the Guillain\u2013Mollaret triangle. Audiologic evaluation is often normal. No specific blood tests are diagnostic; routine labs are performed to rule out metabolic or inflammatory causes.","management_principles":"First-line therapy for essential palatal myoclonus is botulinum toxin injection into the tensor veli palatini muscle under EMG guidance, which reduces muscle contractions and abolishes the clicking sound. Reported response rates exceed 70% (Level C evidence). Oral medications such as clonazepam and sodium valproate have been used with variable success. In symptomatic palatal myoclonus, treatment targets the underlying lesion; botulinum toxin may provide symptomatic relief, but addressing the primary pathology (e.g., surgical resection, immunotherapy for demyelination) is critical. Physical and speech therapy can help patients adapt to residual palatal movements.","follow_up_guidelines":"Patients treated with botulinum toxin require repeat injections every 3\u20136 months based on symptom recurrence. Clinical follow-up should assess reduction in clicking and any dysphagia or velopharyngeal insufficiency from toxin spread. In symptomatic cases, serial MRI at 6\u201312 months may monitor lesion stability or resolution of hypertrophic olivary degeneration. Multidisciplinary follow-up with neurology, otolaryngology, and speech therapy is recommended to optimize functional outcomes.","clinical_pearls":"1. Essential palatal myoclonus stops during sleep\u2014key to differentiating from symptomatic form. 2. Audible clicks are due to tensor veli palatini involvement and occur only in essential palatal myoclonus. 3. MRI abnormalities (hypertrophic olivary degeneration) localize symptomatic palatal myoclonus to the Guillain\u2013Mollaret triangle. 4. Botulinum toxin injection is first-line therapy for essential palatal myoclonus with a high response rate. 5. Persistent palatal tremor despite sleep suggests symptomatic etiology and warrants neuroimaging.","references":"1.
