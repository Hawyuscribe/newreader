Option B, vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), is a palliative neuromodulation therapy typically considered after failure of multiple AEDs and/or when surgery is not feasible. It is less effective than surgery for seizure control and usually not the immediate next step after two AED failures. Option C, adding another AED, is often less effective in this context; the likelihood of seizure freedom decreases significantly after two AED failures, and polytherapy increases side effects without guaranteed benefit. Therefore, simply adding a third AED is generally not the preferred next step. In summary, referral to surgery (Option A) best addresses the clinical scenario of uncontrolled epilepsy after two AEDs, offering the highest potential for seizure remission. VNS (Option B) and adding another AED (Option C) are less optimal immediate next steps.
