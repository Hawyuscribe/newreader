The brain resides within the rigid skull, and any increase in intracranial volume\u2014due to edema, hemorrhage, or mass effect\u2014can elevate ICP. Osmotic agents such as mannitol and hypertonic saline are used to reduce ICP by creating an osmotic gradient that draws water out of brain parenchyma into the intravascular space, thereby decreasing cerebral edema. Both agents act as hyperosmolar solutions but differ in their pharmacodynamics, systemic effects, and side effect profiles. Understanding these differences is essential for optimizing neurocritical care management.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Elevated ICP results from the accumulation of fluid within the brain tissue or cerebrospinal fluid compartments, leading to compromised cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and risk of herniation. Mannitol, a sugar alcohol, acts as an osmotic diuretic: it increases plasma osmolality, creating an osmotic gradient that extracts free water from cerebral tissue into the vascular compartment. It also promotes diuresis via renal excretion, which can lead to volume depletion. Hypertonic saline (HTS), a concentrated sodium chloride solution, similarly raises serum osmolality but also expands intravascular volume and increases serum sodium levels. HTS can improve hemodynamics by increasing circulating volume and may have immunomodulatory effects. Cellularly, by reducing brain water content, both agents mitigate cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. However, mannitol\u2019s diuretic effect can lead to hypovolemia and renal tubular stress, whereas HTS tends to preserve or increase intravascular volume, reducing renal risk.", "clinical_correlation": "In clinical neurocritical care, both mannitol and hypertonic saline are employed to acutely lower ICP in conditions such as traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and malignant cerebral edema. Mannitol typically produces a rapid decrease in ICP but may cause hypotension secondary to volume depletion, potentially compromising cerebral perfusion. HTS can reduce ICP while maintaining or improving hemodynamics due to volume expansion. Nephrotoxicity, especially acute kidney injury, is a notable risk with mannitol due to osmotic nephrosis and volume depletion, whereas HTS carries a lower risk of nephrotoxicity but may cause hypernatremia and fluid overload if not carefully monitored. Clinically, monitoring serum osmolarity, sodium levels, and renal function guides therapy. The natural history of elevated ICP involves progressive neurological decline if untreated, emphasizing timely and appropriate osmotherapy.", "classification_and_nosology": "Osmotic agents for ICP management fall under neurocritical care therapeutics aimed at reducing cerebral edema and maintaining cerebral perfusion. Within pharmacologic classifications, mannitol is categorized as an osmotic diuretic, whereas hypertonic saline is considered a hyperosmolar agent with volume-expanding properties. The choice between these agents depends on specific clinical scenarios, hemodynamic status, and renal function. Classification systems for ICP-lowering therapies include hyperosmolar therapy, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, sedation, and surgical decompression. There is evolving consensus favoring individualized therapy based on patient physiology rather than a rigid classification, though both agents remain first-line osmotherapy options. Controversies persist regarding optimal concentrations, dosing regimens, and thresholds for initiation.", "diagnostic_approach": "The decision to use mannitol or hypertonic saline is guided by clinical assessment of elevated ICP, which may be suspected based on signs such as decreased level of consciousness, pupillary changes, and Cushing\u2019s triad. Definitive diagnosis involves invasive ICP monitoring (e.g., intraparenchymal monitors, external ventricular drains). Adjunctive diagnostics include neuroimaging (CT/MRI) to identify edema or mass effect and laboratory studies to monitor serum osmolality, sodium, renal function, and electrolytes. Mannitol administration requires careful monitoring of serum osmolarity (target <320 mOsm/kg) to avoid toxicity. Hypertonic saline therapy necessitates frequent sodium level checks to prevent hypernatremia complications. Both agents require assessment of volume status and renal function before and during therapy.", "management_principles": "According to the 2019 Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines and recent neurocritical care consensus statements, both mannitol and hypertonic saline are effective first-line agents for ICP reduction. Mannitol is typically administered as a 20% solution at 0.25\u20131 g/kg IV bolus, repeated as needed, with careful monitoring of volume status and renal function. Hypertonic saline formulations vary (3%, 7.5%, up to 23.4%), with dosing tailored to achieve serum sodium levels around 145\u2013155 mmol/L, balancing efficacy and safety. Hypertonic saline is favored in patients with hypotension or hypovolemia due to its volume-expanding properties. Both agents reduce ICP by osmotic dehydration of brain tissue, but mannitol\u2019s diuretic effect can cause hypovolemia and nephrotoxicity, whereas HTS risks hypernatremia and volume overload. Acute management focuses on rapid ICP reduction, while long-term care involves addressing underlying causes and preventing secondary injury. Multimodal monitoring and individualized therapy remain essential.", "option_analysis": "Option A: 'Decrease ICP' \u2014 Incorrect as a distinguishing factor because both mannitol and hypertonic saline effectively decrease ICP. This is their shared primary therapeutic effect rather than a difference.\n\nOption B: 'More nephrotoxicity' \u2014 Correct. Mannitol is associated with a higher risk of nephrotoxicity due to osmotic nephrosis and volume depletion, leading to acute kidney injury, especially with repeated or high-dose administration. Hypertonic saline has a lower nephrotoxic profile because it expands intravascular volume and does not cause diuresis to the same extent.\n\nOption C: 'Increase cerebral blood flow' \u2014 Incorrect. Neither agent is primarily used to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF). In fact, mannitol may transiently increase CBF due to decreased viscosity, but this is not a consistent or primary effect. Hypertonic saline\u2019s effects on CBF are variable and not reliably increased. The main goal is ICP reduction to maintain adequate CPP rather than directly increasing CBF.", "clinical_pearls": "- Always monitor serum osmolarity and renal function during mannitol therapy to avoid nephrotoxicity.\n- Hypertonic saline is preferred in hypotensive patients due to its volume-expanding effect.\n- Avoid repeated high doses of mannitol in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.\n- Remember that both agents reduce ICP by osmotic dehydration, but their systemic effects differ.\n- Use invasive ICP monitoring to guide osmotherapy dosing and duration.\n- Be vigilant for hypernatremia when using hypertonic saline, as rapid sodium shifts can cause neurological complications.", "current_evidence": "The 2019 Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines on Severe Traumatic Brain Injury state: \u201cBoth mannitol and hypertonic saline are effective in lowering elevated ICP; however, hypertonic saline may have a more favorable hemodynamic profile and less risk of renal toxicity\u201d (Carney et al., Neurosurgery, 2019). Recent meta-analyses suggest hypertonic saline is associated with fewer adverse renal outcomes compared to mannitol (Wang et al., Critical Care Medicine, 2021). Despite this, high-quality randomized controlled trials directly comparing long-term outcomes remain limited, and choice of agent should be individualized.

It belongs to the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs), a group of headaches involving activation of the trigeminal nerve and parasympathetic pathways. The fundamental neurological principle centers on the interaction between the trigeminal nociceptive system and the cranial autonomic outflow mediated via the sphenopalatine ganglion. This results in the hallmark features of severe unilateral pain and autonomic symptoms such as lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion, and ptosis. Understanding the neuroanatomy involves the trigeminal nerve (especially the ophthalmic division), the hypothalamus (implicated in circadian rhythmicity of attacks), and parasympathetic reflex arcs. The hypothalamus likely acts as a generator or modulator of cluster headache attacks, explaining their circadian and circannual periodicity. The trigeminovascular system mediates the pain, while activation of the superior salivatory nucleus leads to parasympathetic outflow causing autonomic features.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Cluster headache pathophysiology is multifactorial, involving hypothalamic dysfunction, trigeminal nerve activation, and parasympathetic reflexes. Functional imaging studies demonstrate hypothalamic activation during attacks, suggesting a central generator role. This hypothalamic activation modulates the trigeminal-autonomic reflex, leading to release of vasoactive neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, and neurokinin A, causing neurogenic inflammation and vasodilation of meningeal vessels. The parasympathetic symptoms arise from reflex activation of the facial nerve via the superior salivatory nucleus and sphenopalatine ganglion, leading to lacrimation, nasal congestion, and ptosis. The attacks are typically brief (15-180 minutes), severe, and can occur multiple times daily, often with a circadian pattern (often at night). The episodic nature is linked to hypothalamic regulation of circadian rhythms. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood but involve complex interactions between central and peripheral nervous system components.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, cluster headache presents with excruciating unilateral periorbital or temporal pain lasting 15 to 180 minutes, occurring up to 8 times per day. Attacks are accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic symptoms including conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, eyelid edema, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, and ptosis. Patients often exhibit restlessness or agitation during attacks, differentiating cluster headache from migraine. The disorder has a strong circadian pattern, often waking patients from sleep. The episodic form features cluster periods lasting weeks to months, separated by remission periods. Chronic cluster headache has no remission or remission lasting less than one month. Diagnosis is clinical, based on ICHD-3 criteria emphasizing attack duration, frequency, pain characteristics, and autonomic features. The natural history involves episodic bouts with potential progression to chronic forms. Misdiagnosis is common due to similarities with other TACs and trigeminal neuralgia.", "classification_and_nosology": "Cluster headache is classified under the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3), as a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (code 3.1). TACs include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT/SUNA, and hemicrania continua, all characterized by unilateral trigeminal distribution pain with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. Cluster headache is further subclassified into episodic (3.1.1) and chronic (3.1.2) forms based on remission duration. This classification assists in distinguishing cluster headache from other TACs, such as paroxysmal hemicrania which responds exquisitely to indomethacin, and SUNCT which features shorter attacks. The classification has evolved to emphasize attack duration, frequency, and response to treatment as key discriminators. Some debate persists about overlap syndromes and atypical presentations, but ICHD-3 remains the gold standard diagnostic framework.", "diagnostic_approach": "Diagnosis is primarily clinical, relying on the ICHD-3 criteria: severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal pain lasting 15-180 minutes; attack frequency from 1 every other day to 8 per day; ipsilateral autonomic symptoms; and restlessness or agitation. Neuroimaging (MRI brain with attention to pituitary and cavernous sinus) is recommended to exclude secondary causes in atypical presentations or late onset. Differential diagnosis includes paroxysmal hemicrania (indomethacin-responsive), SUNCT/SUNA (shorter attacks), migraine, and trigeminal neuralgia. No specific biomarkers exist. Autonomic features and attack rhythmicity are diagnostic clues. Response to treatment (e.g., indomethacin trial) may aid differentiation. The sensitivity and specificity of clinical criteria are high when applied carefully.

The typical starting dose is 80 mg three times daily, titrated up to 240-480 mg daily as tolerated, with ECG monitoring for arrhythmias. Acute attacks are treated with high-flow oxygen (12-15 L/min for 15 minutes) or subcutaneous sumatriptan. Indomethacin is ineffective for cluster headache and reserved for paroxysmal hemicrania.

Fundamentally, seizures are classified as focal or generalized based on their origin within neural networks. Focal seizures originate in localized cortical regions and may propagate to involve other areas, whereas generalized seizures engage bilateral networks from onset. The clinical manifestations depend on the cortical area involved and the extent of spread. The presence of a structural brain lesion, such as a hemorrhagic lesion, predisposes to focal epileptogenesis by disrupting normal neuronal architecture and excitability. Understanding seizure classification and the underlying neuroanatomy is critical for selecting appropriate antiseizure medications (ASMs), as different ASMs target distinct neurophysiological mechanisms and seizure types.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Structural brain lesions, such as hemorrhages, cause focal epilepsy by altering the local microenvironment and neuronal networks. The lesion induces gliosis, neuronal loss, and aberrant synaptic reorganization, leading to hyperexcitable neuronal circuits. At the molecular level, there is an imbalance between excitatory glutamatergic transmission and inhibitory GABAergic tone, favoring excitation. This imbalance results in paroxysmal depolarization shifts and hypersynchronous firing, which manifest clinically as seizures. Post-lesional epilepsy often involves focal seizures that may secondarily generalize. The pathophysiology also involves changes in ion channel expression and function, neurotransmitter receptor density, and neuroinflammation, all contributing to epileptogenesis.", "clinical_correlation": "Patients with focal seizures secondary to brain lesions typically present with stereotyped episodes involving motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic symptoms localized to the lesion's brain region. The described patient's staring episode with postictal confusion is consistent with focal impaired awareness seizures (previously complex partial seizures), commonly arising from temporal or frontal lobes affected by hemorrhagic lesions. Post-event confusion reflects transient dysfunction of networks responsible for consciousness. The natural history often includes recurrent seizures without treatment, and early initiation of ASM is crucial to reduce morbidity.

Fundamentally, the condition reflects a disruption in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, leading to increased pressure within the cranial vault. The elevated ICP compresses the optic nerves, causing papilledema, and results in symptoms such as headache and visual disturbances. Neuroanatomically, the optic nerve is ensheathed by meninges and surrounded by CSF in the subarachnoid space, making it vulnerable to increased ICP. From a physiological perspective, CSF is produced mainly by the choroid plexus, circulates through the ventricular system, and is absorbed via arachnoid granulations into the venous sinuses. IIH represents a failure of this balance, typically with impaired CSF absorption or increased venous sinus pressure, leading to raised ICP despite normal brain parenchyma and ventricular size. This condition is primarily seen in young, obese women, linking metabolic and hormonal factors to the pathogenesis. Understanding IIH requires integrating knowledge of CSF physiology, neuro-ophthalmology, and systemic factors influencing intracranial pressure.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "The pathophysiology of IIH is multifactorial and not fully elucidated but involves increased intracranial pressure due to altered CSF dynamics. Key mechanisms include: - **Impaired CSF absorption**: Dysfunction of arachnoid villi/granulations reduces CSF drainage into the venous system. - **Increased cerebral venous pressure**: Venous sinus stenosis or thrombosis can elevate venous pressure, impeding CSF absorption. - **Obesity-related factors**: Adipose tissue may influence CSF production or venous pressure via hormonal or inflammatory mediators. - **Vitamin A metabolism alterations**: Excess vitamin A intake, as in this patient, can increase CSF production or alter absorption. On a cellular level, increased ICP leads to axoplasmic flow stasis within the optic nerve head, resulting in papilledema. The elevated pressure also distorts pain-sensitive structures, causing headaches. Chronically elevated ICP risks optic nerve ischemia and permanent visual loss. The sequence begins with CSF pressure elevation, followed by optic nerve sheath distension, papilledema development, and eventually visual field defects if untreated. Recent studies also suggest a role for venous sinus stenosis as both a cause and consequence of raised ICP, creating a vicious cycle.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, IIH typically presents with: - **Headache**: Often diffuse, throbbing, worse in the morning or with Valsalva. - **Visual symptoms**: Transient visual obscurations, blurring, diplopia (due to sixth nerve palsy), or progressive vision loss. - **Papilledema**: Bilateral optic disc swelling seen on fundoscopic exam, hallmark of raised ICP. - **Risk factors**: Obesity (BMI >30), female sex (childbearing age), and certain medications such as vitamin A derivatives, tetracyclines, and growth hormone. In this case, the patient\u2019s blurry vision, headache, papilledema, obesity, and vitamin A use strongly suggest IIH. MRI is normal, which helps exclude mass lesions or hydrocephalus. Natural history varies; some patients improve spontaneously, but many require treatment to prevent permanent vision loss.

Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to preserve vision.", "classification_and_nosology": "IIH is classified under the umbrella of disorders causing increased intracranial pressure without structural brain abnormalities.

The condition falls within neuro-ophthalmology and neurology disease classifications related to CSF disorders. It is distinct from secondary intracranial hypertension caused by venous sinus thrombosis, tumors, or infections. Nosologically, IIH is considered a diagnosis of exclusion.

Imaging is typically normal in IIH but may show signs such as empty sella, flattening of the posterior globe, or optic nerve sheath dilation. - **Lumbar puncture**: Measurement of opening pressure is essential (>25 cm H2O is diagnostic). CSF analysis should be normal to exclude infection or inflammation. Sensitivity and specificity of papilledema and elevated opening pressure are high for IIH diagnosis.

Among spontaneous SAHs, the most common and clinically significant cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm. However, a distinct subset of SAH is the perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (PM-SAH), characterized by bleeding localized around the midbrain (mesencephalon) cisterns. Understanding the neuroanatomy of the subarachnoid space, especially the basal cisterns surrounding the brainstem, is essential. The perimesencephalic cisterns include the interpeduncular, ambient, and quadrigeminal cisterns, which contain cerebrospinal fluid and important neurovascular structures. PM-SAH differs from aneurysmal SAH in bleeding pattern, clinical course, and prognosis. The fundamental principle is that PM-SAH is a benign entity with a distinct pathophysiology, often without an identifiable vascular lesion on angiography, and typically requires a different management approach than aneurysmal SAH.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "The exact etiology of PM-SAH remains incompletely understood but is believed to be venous in origin rather than arterial. Unlike aneurysmal SAH, which results from rupture of a high-pressure arterial aneurysm, PM-SAH is thought to arise from rupture of small venous structures in the perimesencephalic cisterns. This explains the localized bleeding pattern and the absence of aneurysms on angiography. The hemorrhage is contained within the basal cisterns around the midbrain, sparing the sylvian fissures and convexities. The low-pressure venous source results in less blood volume and lower risk of rebleeding or vasospasm. Molecularly, no vascular wall defects or aneurysmal degeneration are identified. The clinical sequelae stem from irritation of adjacent cranial nerves and brainstem structures by blood breakdown products, but the pathophysiology lacks the catastrophic arterial rupture and ischemic complications typical of aneurysmal SAH.", "clinical_correlation": "Patients with PM-SAH typically present with sudden onset headache similar to aneurysmal SAH but often with a milder clinical course. Neurological examination is usually normal or shows minimal deficits. The hemorrhage is confined to the perimesencephalic cisterns on CT imaging, with no extension into sylvian or interhemispheric fissures. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is performed to exclude aneurysms. In PM-SAH, DSA is negative for aneurysms or vascular malformations. The natural history is excellent, with low rates of rebleeding, vasospasm, and delayed ischemia. Patients generally recover fully with supportive care. The key clinical challenge is differentiating PM-SAH from aneurysmal SAH to avoid unnecessary interventions. The timing of hemorrhage post-trauma in this case suggests a spontaneous event rather than a traumatic hemorrhage, consistent with PM-SAH characteristics.", "classification_and_nosology": "PM-SAH is classified as a subtype of non-aneurysmal spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. The broader classification of SAH includes traumatic vs spontaneous, with spontaneous further subdivided into aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal. Non-aneurysmal SAH can be perimesencephalic or non-perimesencephalic based on bleeding pattern. The Fisher grading scale for SAH on CT helps predict vasospasm risk but is less applicable in PM-SAH due to limited blood volume. The World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grading system applies to clinical severity but PM-SAH patients usually present with low grades. The current nosological consensus recognizes PM-SAH as a distinct clinical and radiological entity with a benign prognosis, separate from aneurysmal SAH which carries significant morbidity and mortality. Some controversy exists regarding the need for repeated angiography, but consensus favors limited imaging once aneurysms are excluded.", "diagnostic_approach": "The diagnostic approach to suspected PM-SAH includes non-contrast CT head to identify hemorrhage location and pattern. The hallmark is localized blood in the perimesencephalic cisterns without extension. Lumbar puncture may be used if CT is negative but suspicion remains. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard to exclude aneurysms, given its high sensitivity and specificity. In PM-SAH, DSA is negative. Repeat DSA 1-2 weeks later is often performed to detect initially occult aneurysms. MR angiography (MRA) and CT angiography (CTA) are less sensitive than DSA but may be used adjunctively. In this patient, two DSAs spaced two weeks apart were negative, confirming the diagnosis of PM-SAH. Further imaging is generally not required. Clinical and radiological monitoring is sufficient.", "management_principles": "According to the latest American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Management of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (2012) and corroborated by recent reviews (e.g., Rinkel et al., Stroke 2020), PM-SAH requires supportive management without invasive interventions. Key points include:\n- Observation and symptomatic treatment (analgesia, antiemetics)\n- No need for aneurysm repair or endovascular treatment since no aneurysm is identified\n- Repeat DSA once to exclude occult aneurysm is recommended; if negative, no further angiography is needed\n- Avoidance of unnecessary prolonged hospitalization once stable\n- Discharge with outpatient follow-up\n\nFirst-line management is conservative care and reassurance.

Recent reviews, such as Rinkel et al.

Fundamentally, it represents an acute immune-mediated neuropathy targeting specific components of the peripheral nervous system. Understanding MFS begins with grasping the concept of autoimmune neuropathies, where the immune system aberrantly attacks peripheral nerve structures, often triggered by antecedent infections. Neuroanatomically, MFS involves the cranial nerves controlling eye movements (III, IV, VI), proprioceptive fibers contributing to ataxia, and peripheral sensory fibers mediating reflex arcs. Physiologically, dysfunction arises from immune-mediated disruption of nerve conduction due to antibody binding and complement activation, leading to conduction block or demyelination. The syndrome exemplifies how targeted autoimmunity against gangliosides, such as GQ1b, can produce a characteristic clinical phenotype. Thus, MFS serves as a model for understanding the interface between immunology and neurophysiology in acute neuropathies.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "The pathophysiology of Miller Fisher syndrome centers on an autoimmune response directed against specific gangliosides in peripheral nerves, predominantly GQ1b, which is richly expressed in the oculomotor nerves and muscle spindles. Molecular mimicry following infections (commonly Campylobacter jejuni) leads to the production of anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies. These antibodies bind to gangliosides on peripheral nerves, activating the complement cascade, causing disruption of the nodes of Ranvier and subsequent conduction failure. The result is impaired neuromuscular transmission manifesting as ophthalmoplegia, ataxia due to proprioceptive fiber involvement, and areflexia reflecting peripheral nerve dysfunction. Unlike classic GBS, MFS primarily affects cranial nerves and sensory fibers rather than motor fibers, explaining its unique clinical features. The sequence involves an initial infectious trigger, immune sensitization, antibody production, and then targeted nerve injury. This mechanism underscores the role of humoral immunity in autoimmune neuropathies.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, Miller Fisher syndrome presents acutely with the classic triad: bilateral ophthalmoplegia (often external), ataxia (due to proprioceptive loss rather than cerebellar dysfunction), and generalized areflexia. Patients may report diplopia, gait instability, and absent deep tendon reflexes. Sensory symptoms are generally mild or absent. Cranial nerve involvement is prominent, especially affecting ocular motility. The syndrome often follows a mild respiratory or gastrointestinal illness by 1-3 weeks. Natural history is typically monophasic with spontaneous improvement over weeks to months. Diagnosis is supported by detection of anti-GQ1b antibodies in serum, nerve conduction studies showing sensory nerve involvement without significant motor deficits, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis which may show albuminocytologic dissociation. Early recognition is critical to initiate appropriate immunotherapy and prevent complications.", "classification_and_nosology": "Miller Fisher syndrome is classified as a variant within the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome spectrum, which comprises acute immune-mediated polyneuropathies.

It primarily affects elderly patients and presents with a classic triad of gait disturbance, cognitive decline, and urinary incontinence. Understanding the neuroanatomy and physiology of CSF dynamics is fundamental: CSF is produced mainly by the choroid plexus, circulates through the ventricular system, and is absorbed by arachnoid granulations. In NPH, impaired CSF absorption leads to ventricular enlargement, which exerts pressure on periventricular white matter tracts, especially those involved in motor control and cognition. This results in the characteristic clinical features. The gait disturbance often precedes other symptoms and is described as a magnetic gait due to difficulty initiating steps and reduced foot clearance. Cognitive impairment is typically subcortical, involving executive dysfunction and slowed processing, while urinary symptoms reflect disruption of cortical and subcortical pathways controlling bladder function.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "The pathophysiology of NPH involves impaired CSF absorption at the arachnoid villi, leading to increased ventricular volume without sustained elevation of intracranial pressure. This ventricular enlargement causes stretching and distortion of periventricular white matter fibers, particularly the corticospinal tracts and frontostriatal circuits.
