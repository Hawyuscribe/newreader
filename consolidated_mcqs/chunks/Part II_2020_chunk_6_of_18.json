Skull and dural metastases commonly arise from primary cancers that frequently metastasize to bone and dura, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and less commonly gastrointestinal or abdominal malignancies. Among these, lung cancer is the most common source of skull and dural metastases. Therefore, chest imaging, specifically chest CT, is the most appropriate initial investigation to identify a primary lung lesion. Option A (Chest CT) directly targets the most probable primary site based on epidemiology and metastatic patterns. Conversely, Option B (MRI abdomen) is less appropriate as abdominal primaries (e.g., gastrointestinal, renal, or hepatic tumors) rarely present initially with isolated skull and dural metastases without other systemic symptoms or signs. MRI abdomen would be considered if chest imaging is negative or if clinical suspicion for abdominal malignancy is high.
