The cardinal clinical features include new-onset headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and elevated inflammatory markers. The immediate priority is to prevent ischemic complications, primarily vision loss, by initiating high-dose corticosteroids promptly. Therefore, starting steroids (Option A) is the first and most critical step once GCA is suspected clinically, even before confirmatory testing. Delaying treatment until biopsy results are available risks permanent visual impairment. Temporal artery biopsy (Option B) remains the gold standard for diagnosis, providing histopathological confirmation of GCA. However, biopsy should not delay steroid initiation and is typically performed within 1-2 weeks after starting steroids, as histological changes persist despite treatment initiation. Hence, both options are essential components of GCA management but serve different purposes: steroids for immediate treatment and biopsy for diagnostic confirmation. Option A alone is partially correct but incomplete without biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Option B alone is incorrect as biopsy without prompt steroid therapy risks serious complications. The best practice per current guidelines (e.g., American College of Rheumatology, 2021) is to start steroids immediately upon clinical suspicion and arrange for temporal artery biopsy promptly.

The absence of a macular star or neuroretinitis does not exclude Bartonella; early retinal lesions are well documented. \n\nOption A (Bartonella) best fits the described retinal finding.

TB retinitis is less common and usually presents with multifocal choroiditis or vasculitis rather than isolated retinal whitening.\n\nOption C (CMV) retinitis occurs mainly in immunocompromised patients and presents with full-thickness retinal necrosis and hemorrhages ('pizza pie' appearance), not isolated orange spots or retinal whitening.\n\nOption D (Toxoplasmosis) typically causes focal necrotizing retinochoroiditis with a characteristic fluffy white lesion adjacent to an old pigmented scar, often with vitritis ('headlight in the fog'), but not an orange spot or isolated retinal whitening.\n\nOption E (None) is incorrect as Bartonella clearly explains the retinal finding.\n\nTherefore, Bartonella infection is the most appropriate diagnosis given the retinal whitening with an orange spot, even in the absence of a macular star or neuroretinitis.
