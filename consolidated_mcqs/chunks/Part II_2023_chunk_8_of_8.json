Fundamentally, seizures arise from abnormal, excessive, and synchronous neuronal discharges within the brain. The clinical manifestations depend on the location and extent of cortical involvement. In patients with episodes of loss of awareness and possible progression to generalized tonic-clonic seizures (TCS), it is critical to establish whether these episodes are epileptic seizures and to localize the epileptogenic zone. Routine investigations such as interictal EEG and MRI are initial steps but can be normal in a significant subset of patients. Understanding the limitations of these tests and the role of advanced diagnostic modalities is essential for accurate diagnosis and management.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Epileptic seizures result from a disruption in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks, leading to hypersynchronous electrical activity. The pathophysiology involves alterations at molecular and cellular levels, including ion channel dysfunction, neurotransmitter imbalances (excess glutamate or deficient GABAergic inhibition), and network reorganization (e.g., mossy fiber sprouting in temporal lobe epilepsy). In cases where routine EEG and MRI are normal, the epileptogenic focus may be deep, small, or involve brain regions not easily detected by these modalities. The intermittent nature of epileptiform discharges also contributes to false-negative EEG findings. Hence, prolonged monitoring techniques are necessary to capture ictal events and better characterize seizure onset zones.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, loss of awareness with or without progression to TCS is suggestive of focal onset impaired awareness seizures or focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Normal interictal EEG and MRI do not exclude epilepsy, especially in temporal lobe epilepsy or extratemporal epilepsies where structural abnormalities may be microscopic or functional rather than grossly visible. The natural history involves recurrent seizures with variable frequency and severity. Diagnosis relies heavily on capturing ictal events to confirm epileptic origin. Video EEG monitoring allows correlation of clinical events with EEG changes, essential for differentiating epileptic seizures from non-epileptic paroxysmal events and for localizing seizure onset.

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2017 classification emphasizes seizure onset and etiology. The described scenario fits into focal epilepsy with impaired awareness seizures, possibly evolving to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Normal MRI and EEG place the patient in a subgroup of epilepsy with non-lesional or cryptogenic epilepsy. This classification guides diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PET imaging falls under functional neuroimaging used in presurgical evaluation, whereas video EEG is a diagnostic standard for seizure characterization.", "diagnostic_approach": "The diagnostic approach starts with detailed clinical history and routine EEG and MRI. When these are normal but clinical suspicion remains high, prolonged video EEG monitoring is the next step. Video EEG captures ictal events with simultaneous clinical observation and EEG recording, increasing sensitivity for detecting epileptiform activity and enabling seizure classification and localization. Interictal PET scans detect areas of hypometabolism that may correspond to epileptogenic zones but have limited sensitivity and specificity when used alone. Video EEG is the gold standard for diagnosis in challenging cases with normal routine tests. The sensitivity of routine EEG is approximately 50% after one study and increases with repeated or prolonged recordings.

The fundamental neurological principle in managing acute relapses involves modulating the immune-mediated inflammatory response causing demyelination and axonal injury. High-dose corticosteroids, such as intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP), are the first-line treatment because they rapidly suppress inflammation, stabilize the blood-brain barrier, and reduce edema around demyelinating plaques.\n\nAt a more advanced level, understanding RRMS requires knowledge of the neuroanatomy of white matter tracts vulnerable to immune attack, including periventricular, juxtacortical, and infratentorial regions, as well as the neurophysiology of immune cell trafficking across the CNS vasculature. The pathogenesis involves autoreactive T cells, B cells, and macrophages targeting myelin antigens, leading to demyelination, conduction block, and secondary axonal damage. The acute inflammatory phase is the therapeutic target during relapses, while chronic neurodegeneration underlies progression. Thus, managing an acute relapse aims to quickly reduce inflammation to restore neurological function and minimize permanent damage.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "In RRMS relapses, activated autoreactive lymphocytes cross the blood-brain barrier, initiating an inflammatory cascade that leads to focal demyelination and axonal injury. This process involves cytokine release (e.g., IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1), complement activation, and recruitment of macrophages and microglia that phagocytose myelin. The resulting conduction block causes the clinical symptoms of relapse. High-dose corticosteroids reduce this inflammation by multiple mechanisms: inhibiting cytokine production, stabilizing endothelial tight junctions, and inducing lymphocyte apoptosis.\n\nWhen patients are refractory to steroids, it suggests persistent immune activation or a steroid-insensitive inflammatory pathway. Plasma exchange (PLEX) acts by removing circulating pathogenic autoantibodies, immune complexes, and complement components, thereby interrupting immune-mediated damage. This is particularly relevant in cases where humoral immunity plays a prominent role. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has immunomodulatory effects but is less established in MS relapse management.

The fundamental neurological principle in PPMS is the progressive neurodegeneration and demyelination within the CNS, leading to cumulative axonal loss and disability. Neuroanatomically, MS lesions primarily affect the white matter tracts, including the corticospinal tracts, dorsal columns, and cerebellar pathways, but gray matter involvement is increasingly recognized. The pathophysiology involves immune-mediated damage to myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes, with secondary axonal injury.

Understanding epilepsy classification requires familiarity with the neuroanatomical substrates of seizure generation and the physiological mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis. \n\nAt the basic level, seizures can be focal (originating in one hemisphere) or generalized (involving both hemispheres from onset). Epilepsy classification systems, such as the 2017 ILAE (International League Against Epilepsy) framework, emphasize etiology\u2014dividing epilepsy into genetic, structural, metabolic, immune, infectious, and unknown categories. This approach reflects advances in neuroimaging and molecular genetics, allowing clinicians to correlate specific brain abnormalities with seizure types and epilepsy syndromes. \n\nNeuroanatomically, heterotopia refers to the presence of normal gray matter in abnormal locations, typically due to neuronal migration disorders during brain development. These malformations can serve as epileptogenic foci by disrupting normal cortical circuitry, producing hyperexcitable networks that predispose to seizures. Thus, recognizing structural abnormalities such as heterotopia on MRI is critical for etiological classification and treatment planning.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Neuronal migration disorders, including gray matter heterotopia, arise from disruptions during fetal brain development when neurons fail to reach their intended cortical destinations. This results in ectopic clusters of neurons that retain excitatory and inhibitory properties but are abnormally positioned, leading to dysfunctional cortical networks.\n\nThe heterotopic neurons can generate abnormal electrical activity due to:\n- Disrupted synaptic connectivity\n- Altered balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission\n- Abnormal intrinsic membrane properties\n\nThese pathophysiological changes create epileptogenic zones that manifest clinically as seizures. Molecularly, mutations affecting cytoskeletal proteins, signaling pathways (e.g., FLNA mutations in periventricular nodular heterotopia), and cell adhesion molecules underlie these malformations. The clinical epilepsy phenotype depends on the size, location, and extent of heterotopia, and the associated cortical dysplasia or other brain abnormalities.\n\nSeizures in heterotopia often begin in childhood or adolescence and may be refractory to medications due to the intrinsic epileptogenicity of the malformed tissue.", "clinical_correlation": "Patients with heterotopia-related epilepsy typically present with focal seizures, which may or may not be preceded by an aura.

The epileptogenic zone is defined as the minimal cortical area that must be resected or disconnected to achieve seizure freedom, encompassing all tissue capable of generating seizures. In contrast, the ictal onset zone is the region where clinical seizures actually begin, identified by initial electrographic changes on EEG during a seizure. Neuroanatomically, these zones may overlap but are not identical. The epileptogenic zone concept integrates multiple functional and electrophysiological data to localize the true seizure-generating tissue, which is often larger or more complex than the ictal onset zone alone. Advanced understanding requires appreciation of the network nature of epilepsy, where seizure propagation pathways and irritative zones contribute to seizure semiology and EEG findings but may not need resection for seizure control.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "The pathophysiology of focal epilepsy involves a hyperexcitable and hypersynchronous neuronal network within the epileptogenic zone. Cellular changes include altered ion channel expression, neurotransmitter imbalances (e.g., increased excitatory glutamate, decreased inhibitory GABA), gliosis, and synaptic reorganization such as mossy fiber sprouting in temporal lobe epilepsy. These molecular and cellular abnormalities create a substrate capable of initiating and sustaining seizure activity. The ictal onset zone is the initial site where these pathophysiological processes manifest as detectable electrophysiological seizure discharges. However, the epileptogenic zone encompasses all cortical tissue necessary for seizure generation, including areas involved in seizure initiation, propagation, and maintenance. Surgical removal of this zone interrupts the seizure network, preventing seizure recurrence. The sequence of events begins with abnormal neuronal firing in the epileptogenic zone, which spreads to the ictal onset zone and then to propagation zones, producing clinical seizure manifestations. Etiologically, epileptogenic zones may arise from cortical dysplasia, tumors, vascular malformations, or post-injury gliosis, each contributing distinct pathophysiological mechanisms.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, patients with focal epilepsy present with seizures originating from the epileptogenic zone, which may produce diverse semiologies depending on the involved cortical region. The ictal onset zone corresponds to the initial electrographic seizure focus but may not fully represent the epileptogenic substrate. Seizure freedom after surgery depends on complete resection of the epileptogenic zone, not merely the ictal onset zone. Incomplete resection of the epileptogenic zone leads to persistent seizures despite removal of the ictal onset zone. Natural history involves progressive seizure burden if untreated, with potential for epileptogenesis to expand the epileptogenic zone over time. Diagnostic findings such as interictal epileptiform discharges, ictal EEG patterns, MRI lesions, and functional imaging all contribute to delineating the epileptogenic zone.

It belongs to the broader nosology of focal epilepsies and epilepsy surgery candidates. The epileptogenic zone concept is distinct from but related to the seizure onset zone classification used in EEG interpretations.

Sensitivity and specificity vary by modality; for example, MRI-visible lesions have high predictive value for epileptogenic zones but may be absent in MRI-negative epilepsy. Intracranial EEG provides gold-standard localization by directly recording from the cortex, delineating the epileptogenic zone with high spatial resolution. The expected finding for surgical candidacy is congruence between clinical, electrophysiological, and imaging data localizing a discrete epileptogenic zone amenable to resection. The 2022 ILAE surgical guidelines emphasize a comprehensive presurgical evaluation including these modalities to optimize outcomes.", "management_principles": "According to the 2022 ILAE Surgical Therapy of Epilepsy Guidelines, the primary management principle for drug-resistant focal epilepsy is surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone. First-line surgical treatment involves resection or disconnection of the epileptogenic zone with the goal of seizure freedom. Second-line options include neuromodulation techniques (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation, responsive neurostimulation) when resection is not feasible. The rationale for targeting the epileptogenic zone is supported by evidence showing that complete resection correlates with the highest rates of seizure freedom (up to 70-80%). Mechanistically, removing the epileptogenic zone eliminates the pathological substrate generating seizures. Acute management of seizures remains pharmacological, but surgery offers a definitive cure in selected cases. Long-term care requires monitoring for seizure recurrence, neuropsychological assessment, and rehabilitation as needed. Patient selection and precise localization are paramount to avoid neurological deficits.", "option_analysis": "Option A (Epileptogenic zone) is correct because it represents the minimal cortical area that must be removed to achieve seizure freedom.

Evidence from multiple surgical series supports that complete removal of the epileptogenic zone is the strongest predictor of postoperative seizure freedom.\n\nOption B (Ictal onset zone) is incorrect because, although it marks the initial site of seizure activity on EEG, it does not necessarily encompass the entire epileptogenic substrate. The ictal onset zone may be smaller or even partially overlap with the epileptogenic zone but resecting it alone may leave residual epileptogenic tissue, resulting in persistent seizures.

The brain\u2019s susceptibility to metabolic insults underscores the importance of monitoring for altered mental status after ASM loading, especially with agents like VPA that can induce metabolic side effects.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Valproic acid is metabolized primarily in the liver via mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation and glucuronidation. It can cause **hyperammonemia** by impairing the urea cycle through inhibition of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, leading to accumulation of ammonia, a neurotoxic metabolite. Elevated ammonia levels disrupt astrocyte function and cerebral energy metabolism, resulting in cerebral edema, altered neurotransmission, and encephalopathy. This pathophysiological cascade manifests clinically as agitation, confusion, and decreased consciousness despite normal liver function tests and VPA levels. In alcoholic patients, pre-existing hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbates this risk. The sequence typically begins with VPA administration, followed by ammonia accumulation, then neurotoxicity, and finally clinical encephalopathy. Importantly, hyperammonemia can occur even with normal liver enzymes and normal VPA serum levels, making ammonia measurement critical in this context.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, VPA-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy presents with nonspecific neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation, irritability, confusion, and decreased level of consciousness. Seizure control may paradoxically worsen or new seizures may emerge. The timing is usually within days of initiating or increasing VPA dose. Laboratory tests often show normal liver function and therapeutic VPA levels, which can mislead clinicians. Ammonia levels, however, are elevated and correlate with symptom severity. This syndrome differs from alcohol intoxication or withdrawal, which have distinct clinical and laboratory features. The natural history improves with cessation or dose reduction of VPA and interventions to lower ammonia. Failure to recognize this can lead to prolonged encephalopathy or permanent neurological damage.", "classification_and_nosology": "VPA-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy is classified as a **metabolic encephalopathy secondary to drug toxicity** within the broader category of ASM adverse effects. It falls under the nosology of **toxic-metabolic encephalopathies**, distinct from structural or infectious causes of altered consciousness. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classifies ASM adverse effects by timing, severity, and mechanism; hyperammonemic encephalopathy is an idiosyncratic, dose-independent metabolic adverse effect. Differential diagnoses include hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol-related encephalopathies (e.g., Wernicke\u2019s), and other ASM toxicities. Current consensus emphasizes recognition of metabolic encephalopathy in patients on VPA, especially with risk factors like alcoholism or polytherapy.", "diagnostic_approach": "Evaluation of altered consciousness and agitation in a patient on VPA requires a systematic approach: 1) Confirm seizure control and exclude ongoing status epilepticus with EEG. 2) Exclude metabolic derangements: check electrolytes, glucose, liver function tests, and importantly, **serum ammonia level**. 3) Assess VPA serum concentration to rule out toxicity. 4) Consider neuroimaging if structural causes suspected. Serum ammonia measurement is the most sensitive and specific test for VPA-induced encephalopathy, given that liver function tests and VPA levels can be normal. Blood ethanol levels are less relevant unless acute intoxication is suspected clinically. Diagnostic criteria include altered mental status with elevated ammonia in the setting of VPA therapy, with exclusion of other causes.", "management_principles": "According to the 2022 American Epilepsy Society guidelines on ASM adverse effects, the primary management of VPA-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy includes: 1) Immediate discontinuation or dose reduction of VPA. 2) Administration of **L-carnitine**, which replenishes mitochondrial carnitine stores and enhances ammonia metabolism (Level B evidence). 3) Supportive care including monitoring airway and cerebral function. 4) Consider alternative ASMs to maintain seizure control. First-line therapy is stopping VPA and starting L-carnitine; ammonia levels typically normalize within days. Second-line interventions may include dialysis in refractory cases. Early recognition and treatment are critical to prevent irreversible neurological damage.", "option_analysis": "Option A: **Send for ETOH level** \u2014 Incorrect. Although the patient is alcoholic, the clinical scenario post-VPA loading with agitation and decreased consciousness is more consistent with VPA-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Ethanol level is unlikely to explain delayed deterioration after 2 days, especially with normal labs and no acute intoxication signs. Ethanol levels have limited utility unless acute intoxication or withdrawal is suspected.\n\nOption B: **Ammonia level** \u2014 Correct. Elevated ammonia is the hallmark of VPA-induced encephalopathy. Measuring ammonia is essential to diagnose this treatable metabolic complication, especially when liver function and VPA levels are normal. This test directly informs management decisions and prognosis. The clinical presentation and timing align with hyperammonemia, making this the discriminating diagnostic step.", "clinical_pearls": "- **VPA-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur with normal liver enzymes and therapeutic drug levels.** Always check ammonia if unexplained encephalopathy develops.\n- Alcoholism predisposes to mitochondrial dysfunction, increasing risk of VPA toxicity.\n- **L-carnitine supplementation is a key adjunctive therapy** in VPA toxicity.\n- Do not attribute altered mental status solely to alcohol levels without considering ASM effects.\n- Early recognition and treatment can reverse symptoms and prevent permanent damage.\n- Memory aid: In any patient on VPA with altered consciousness, think \u201c**VPA \u2192 Viciously elevated Plasma Ammonia**.\u201d", "current_evidence": "The 2022 American Epilepsy Society guideline states: \u201cIn patients treated with valproic acid who develop unexplained encephalopathy, serum ammonia measurement is essential even if liver function tests and valproic acid levels are normal.

While multiple sclerosis (MS) and anti-MOG antibody-associated disorders primarily involve oligodendrocytes and myelin, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is characterized by a primary autoimmune attack on astrocytes. This distinction is fundamental to grasping the pathophysiology and clinical features of these diseases.\n\nOn a more detailed neuroanatomical level, astrocytes envelop CNS blood vessels and synapses, regulating water and ion homeostasis via channels such as aquaporin-4 (AQP4). The autoimmune targeting of astrocytic AQP4 in NMOSD leads to astrocyte injury, secondary demyelination, and neuronal damage. This contrasts with anti-MOG disease, where the immune response is directed against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein on oligodendrocytes. Recognizing these cellular targets helps clinicians differentiate between overlapping demyelinating syndromes and tailor therapy accordingly.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "NMOSD is primarily caused by pathogenic immunoglobulin G autoantibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water channel highly expressed on astrocyte foot processes at the blood-brain barrier. Binding of AQP4-IgG to astrocytes initiates complement-dependent cytotoxicity, leading to astrocyte destruction. This astrocyte loss disrupts CNS homeostasis, causing secondary demyelination, neuronal injury, and inflammation.\n\nThe sequence of events involves:\n- Autoantibody production by peripheral B cells\n- Penetration of AQP4-IgG into the CNS\n- Binding to astrocyte AQP4 channels\n- Activation of complement cascade and recruitment of inflammatory cells\n- Astrocyte necrosis and loss\n- Secondary oligodendrocyte injury and demyelination\n\nThis mechanism distinguishes NMOSD from other demyelinating diseases such as anti-MOG antibody disease, where the immune attack is directed at myelin components rather than astrocytes.

These manifestations correlate with the distribution of AQP4-rich astrocytes and the resultant astrocytopathy.\n\nThe astrocyte damage leads to blood-brain barrier disruption and extensive inflammation, explaining the severity of attacks and poor recovery compared to MS.

The cardinal clinical feature is the persistence of focal aware seizures despite treatment, indicating refractory focal epilepsy. The key clinical issue is determining the next diagnostic step to guide further management. Option B (Video EEG) is the most appropriate next step because it provides simultaneous clinical and electrographic data, allowing precise localization and characterization of seizure onset zones, seizure semiology correlation, and differentiation from non-epileptic events.

These seizures manifest with clinical signs corresponding to the function of the involved cortical area, such as motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic phenomena. Understanding the neuroanatomy is essential: the seizure focus lies in a discrete cortical zone, often in eloquent cortex, which produces stereotyped symptoms without loss of awareness. The epileptogenic zone is the minimum cortical area that must be resected to achieve seizure freedom, which may be larger than the seizure onset zone identified electrographically. The neurophysiology involves hypersynchronous neuronal discharges initiating in a focal area, with potential propagation depending on the network involved. In pharmacoresistant cases, precise localization of the epileptogenic zone becomes critical for surgical or alternative therapies.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Pharmacoresistant focal aware seizures reflect persistent epileptogenic networks that are not adequately suppressed by antiseizure medications (ASMs). The underlying pathophysiology involves abnormal excitatory-inhibitory balance, often due to structural lesions (e.g., focal cortical dysplasia, hippocampal sclerosis), genetic channelopathies, or acquired insults. Molecularly, alterations in ion channel function, neurotransmitter receptor expression, and synaptic plasticity contribute to hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony. This results in recurrent focal seizures that remain electrically active despite ASM therapy. The lack of aura in this scenario indicates that the seizure onset may be in a region producing direct clinical symptoms without preceding subjective warning. The persistence of seizures despite two ASMs defines drug-resistant epilepsy, necessitating further evaluation for potential surgical candidacy or advanced diagnostics.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, focal aware seizures present with symptoms localized to the cortical area involved, such as unilateral motor jerks, sensory disturbances, or autonomic signs, without impaired consciousness. The absence of aura suggests the initial symptom is an overt focal sign rather than a subjective warning. Pharmacoresistance is defined by failure of adequate trials of two tolerated, appropriately chosen and used ASMs to achieve sustained seizure freedom. Patients with uncontrolled focal aware seizures require comprehensive evaluation to identify the epileptogenic zone. The natural history involves risk of seizure progression, secondary generalization, and impact on quality of life. Diagnostic findings include interictal and ictal EEG abnormalities localized to the seizure focus and neuroimaging evidence of structural lesions. However, in some cases, MRI may be normal, necessitating additional functional imaging or prolonged video-EEG monitoring.", "classification_and_nosology": "Focal aware seizures fall under the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2017 classification, categorized as focal onset aware seizures. Epilepsy is classified by seizure type (focal, generalized, unknown) and etiology (structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune, unknown). Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined by ILAE as failure to achieve sustained seizure freedom after two adequate ASM trials. This classification framework guides diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The nosology emphasizes the importance of seizure semiology, EEG correlation, and imaging findings to delineate epilepsy syndromes and inform prognosis. Controversies remain regarding the optimal timing and modalities for invasive monitoring and surgery, but consensus supports early comprehensive evaluation in pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy.", "diagnostic_approach": "The diagnostic approach to pharmacoresistant focal aware seizures centers on precise localization and characterization of the epileptogenic zone. The first step after failure of two ASMs is prolonged video-EEG monitoring to capture habitual seizures with simultaneous clinical and electrographic data, which is the gold standard for seizure localization and classification. Video-EEG allows correlation of semiology with ictal EEG patterns, essential for surgical planning. High-resolution MRI with epilepsy protocol is crucial but may be normal in some cases. Functional imaging such as FDG-PET or ictal SPECT can be adjuncts when MRI is negative or discordant. Repeat MRI with advanced sequences can detect subtle lesions missed initially. However, without electroclinical correlation from video-EEG, imaging alone is insufficient to define the epileptogenic zone. Thus, video-EEG is the next best step after ASM failure in focal aware seizures.", "management_principles": "According to the 2017 ILAE and the 2022 American Epilepsy Society guidelines, the management of pharmacoresistant focal seizures requires comprehensive evaluation at an epilepsy center. First-line treatment remains ASMs tailored to seizure type and patient factors, but failure of two ASMs defines drug resistance. The next step is detailed presurgical evaluation including video-EEG monitoring to localize the epileptogenic zone. If a focal lesion is identified and concordant with EEG, surgical resection is considered first-line for cure. Other options include neuromodulation (VNS, RNS) if surgery is not feasible. The mechanism of video-EEG is to capture ictal events and define electroclinical correlation, guiding management decisions. Acute seizure management remains supportive, but long-term seizure control depends on identifying surgical candidates. Multidisciplinary care involving neurologists, neuropsychologists, and neurosurgeons is essential.", "option_analysis": "Option A: FDG-PET \u2014 Incorrect as an immediate next step. FDG-PET is useful in MRI-negative epilepsy to identify hypometabolic regions but is adjunctive after video-EEG. It lacks temporal resolution and cannot replace ictal electroclinical correlation.\n\nOption B: Video EEG \u2014 Correct. Video-EEG monitoring is the gold standard for capturing seizures with simultaneous clinical and EEG data, essential for localization in pharmacoresistant focal aware seizures. It guides surgical candidacy and further management.\n\nOption C: SPECT \u2014 Incorrect as initial next step. Ictal SPECT requires seizure capture during injection, is logistically challenging, and is typically used after video-EEG or when MRI/PET are inconclusive.\n\nOption D: Repeat MRI with high resolution \u2014 Incorrect as immediate next step.
