Kernicterus is a well-characterized condition caused by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia crossing the immature blood-brain barrier, leading to selective neurotoxicity. The classic neuroanatomical target in kernicterus is the basal ganglia, particularly the globus pallidus (GP), as well as subthalamic nuclei and certain brainstem nuclei. MRI findings typically show T2 hyperintensity and sometimes volume loss in the globus pallidus. \n\nOption C (GP) is the most accurate and specific answer because the globus pallidus is the hallmark site of bilirubin-induced injury. \n\nOption A (Thalamus) is incorrect because the thalamus is not a primary site of bilirubin toxicity in neonates. While the thalamus can be involved in other neonatal encephalopathies, it is not characteristic for kernicterus.\n\nOption B (Caudate) is also incorrect; although the caudate nucleus is part of the basal ganglia, it is less commonly affected in kernicterus compared to the globus pallidus. The caudate is more involved in other metabolic or hypoxic-ischemic injuries.\n\nOptions D and E (None) are clearly incorrect since kernicterus has well-documented MRI correlates, and the question implies a lesion site is expected.\n\nIn summary, the cardinal features (early neonatal seizures and hyperbilirubinemia) strongly point to kernicterus, whose MRI hallmark is globus pallidus involvement.
