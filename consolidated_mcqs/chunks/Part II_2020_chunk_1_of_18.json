The lesion site responsible for this syndrome is the base (ventral portion) of the midbrain, specifically involving the cerebral peduncle and the exiting oculomotor nerve fibers. This location explains the clinical features: damage to the oculomotor nerve fibers causes ipsilateral third nerve palsy, and involvement of the corticospinal tract within the cerebral peduncle results in contralateral hemiparesis. Option A (base of midbrain) precisely corresponds to this anatomical and clinical correlation. Option B (tegmentum) refers to the dorsal part of the midbrain, which is involved in other syndromes such as Benedikt syndrome (which includes oculomotor palsy plus contralateral tremor and ataxia), but not Weber syndrome. Option C (tectum) is the dorsal-most part of the midbrain, containing the superior and inferior colliculi, and lesions here cause different clinical signs such as vertical gaze palsy or Parinaud syndrome, not the Weber syndrome pattern. Therefore, option A is the only correct answer that fully explains the cardinal features of Weber syndrome.
