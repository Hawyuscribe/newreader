The anterior temporal and occipital MRI changes are characteristic of certain small vessel or inflammatory vasculopathies, such as CADASIL or vasculitis, but the presence of neuropathy and visual symptoms broadens the differential. Skin biopsy is a minimally invasive diagnostic tool that can detect small fiber neuropathy, vasculitis, or deposition diseases (e.g., amyloidosis) and can reveal vascular pathology or nerve fiber loss, which correlates with neuropathy and systemic involvement. Muscle biopsy, while useful in myopathies or mitochondrial disorders, is less informative for neuropathies or CNS white matter changes. It does not address the neuropathy or vascular pathology suggested by MRI. Given the combination of peripheral neuropathy and CNS MRI abnormalities, skin biopsy is the more appropriate initial diagnostic step to evaluate for vasculitis or small fiber neuropathy.

The two options, conduction block and temporal dispersion, are electrophysiological phenomena that can cause amplitude changes but have distinct characteristics. Conduction block refers to a significant reduction in the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) between proximal and distal stimulation sites due to failure of impulse propagation, typically seen in demyelinating neuropathies such as multifocal motor neuropathy or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Temporal dispersion, on the other hand, is characterized by a prolonged CMAP duration with a more gradual decline in amplitude due to desynchronized conduction of nerve fibers, also seen in demyelinating conditions but does not necessarily cause a sharp drop in amplitude. The question states a drop in amplitude, which is more specifically indicative of conduction block rather than temporal dispersion.
