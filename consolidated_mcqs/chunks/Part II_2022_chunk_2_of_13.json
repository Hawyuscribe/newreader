The most common form, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), primarily affects the myelin sheath or axons of peripheral nerves. The **PMP22 gene** is the most frequently implicated gene, with duplications causing CMT1A (a demyelinating neuropathy) and deletions causing hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). However, when PMP22 testing is negative, other genetic causes must be considered. Understanding the genetic heterogeneity of hereditary neuropathies is essential for accurate diagnosis and management. Neuroanatomically, peripheral nerves comprise axons ensheathed by Schwann cells producing myelin; dysfunction in either component can cause neuropathy. At the molecular level, mutations in genes encoding myelin proteins, cytoskeletal components, or ion channels can disrupt nerve conduction and axonal transport, leading to clinical neuropathy.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "The pathophysiology of hereditary peripheral neuropathies involves mutations in genes critical for the structure and function of peripheral nerves. PMP22 mutations affect myelin compaction and Schwann cell function, but other genes such as **SPLTC1** (likely a typographical variant of SPTLC1) are involved in sphingolipid metabolism, which is crucial for neuronal membrane integrity and axonal health. Mutations in SPTLC1 cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1), characterized by progressive sensory loss, neuropathic ulcers, and sometimes motor involvement. These mutations lead to accumulation of toxic deoxysphingolipids, which impair mitochondrial function and axonal transport, causing distal axonal degeneration. The sequence begins with genetic mutation \u2192 abnormal lipid metabolism \u2192 neuronal toxicity \u2192 axonal degeneration \u2192 clinical neuropathy with sensory loss and ulceration. This differs mechanistically from demyelinating neuropathies primarily affecting Schwann cells.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, hereditary neuropathies present with distal symmetric sensory loss, muscle weakness, and foot deformities. Neuropathic ulcers, especially on pressure points, result from loss of protective sensation. In patients negative for PMP22 mutations but with neuropathic ulcers, mutations in **SPTLC1** (option D) should be considered, as HSAN1 often presents with painful or painless distal sensory loss and ulcerations. Unlike CMT1A, which is demyelinating and presents with pes cavus and distal weakness, HSAN1 presents predominantly with sensory loss and ulcers. The natural history involves progressive sensory loss, secondary motor involvement, and risk of infection from ulcers. Diagnosis hinges on genetic testing beyond PMP22, nerve conduction studies showing axonal neuropathy, and clinical features. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications.", "classification_and_nosology": "Hereditary peripheral neuropathies are classified broadly into **Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)** and **hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN)**. CMT is subdivided into demyelinating (CMT1), axonal (CMT2), and intermediate types based on nerve conduction velocities and pathology. PMP22 mutations cause CMT1A and HNPP. HSANs are classified into types 1 through 5 based on genetic cause and clinical features; **HSAN1** is caused by mutations in the **SPTLC1** gene. The nosology reflects both clinical phenotype and genetic etiology. This classification has evolved with advances in molecular genetics, highlighting the heterogeneity of hereditary neuropathies. Competing systems focus on electrophysiological versus genetic classification, but current consensus integrates both, emphasizing genotype-phenotype correlations.", "diagnostic_approach": "The diagnostic workup for hereditary neuropathy starts with detailed clinical evaluation and family history, followed by nerve conduction studies (NCS) to categorize neuropathy as demyelinating or axonal. If NCS shows demyelinating neuropathy, PMP22 duplication/deletion testing is first-line due to prevalence. When PMP22 testing is negative, next-generation sequencing panels including genes such as **SPTLC1** are indicated. Genetic testing sensitivity is high with current panels, and identification of pathogenic variants confirms diagnosis. Skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density may aid in HSAN diagnosis. Biochemical assays for deoxysphingolipid levels can support HSAN1 diagnosis. Interpretation requires correlation with clinical phenotype. Early genetic diagnosis informs prognosis and guides management.", "management_principles": "According to the **European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines (2020)** on hereditary neuropathies, management is primarily supportive and symptomatic. There is no disease-modifying therapy for most genetic neuropathies including HSAN1. First-line management includes meticulous foot care to prevent ulcers and infections, physical therapy to maintain strength and function, and pain management for neuropathic symptoms. Genetic counseling is essential. Experimental therapies targeting sphingolipid metabolism, such as L-serine supplementation in HSAN1, have shown promise in small studies but are not yet standard of care.

At its core, muscle contraction depends on the proper function of ion channels and electrolyte gradients across muscle cell membranes. Electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and calcium play critical roles in maintaining the resting membrane potential and enabling action potentials that trigger muscle contraction. Disruptions in these electrolytes can lead to transient or persistent muscle weakness. Understanding this fundamental relationship between electrolyte homeostasis and muscle excitability is essential for diagnosing episodic weakness disorders, such as hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP). HypoPP is a channelopathy characterized by episodes of muscle weakness associated with low serum potassium levels. This condition illustrates the intersection of neurophysiology, ion channel function, and clinical neuromuscular disease, highlighting the importance of targeted laboratory evaluation in patients presenting with episodic weakness.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is primarily caused by mutations in voltage-gated ion channels, most commonly the CACNA1S gene encoding the skeletal muscle L-type calcium channel or the SCN4A gene encoding the skeletal muscle sodium channel. These mutations alter ion channel gating, leading to abnormal membrane excitability. During attacks, a shift of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment occurs, resulting in hypokalemia. This hypokalemia hyperpolarizes the muscle cell membrane, reducing excitability and causing muscle weakness or paralysis. The episodes are often triggered by factors such as carbohydrate-rich meals, rest after exercise, or stress, which promote insulin release and intracellular potassium uptake. The molecular defect in channel function combined with the altered potassium distribution explains the episodic nature of weakness and its reversible course. The pathophysiology underscores the critical role of potassium in maintaining muscle membrane potential and the delicate balance required for normal neuromuscular function.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, hypokalemic periodic paralysis presents with recurrent episodes of generalized or proximal muscle weakness, often occurring in the early morning or after rest following exertion. Patients typically report sudden onset of weakness without sensory changes or altered consciousness. The weakness can range from mild to severe, sometimes involving respiratory muscles in rare cases. Between attacks, patients are usually asymptomatic with normal strength. The hallmark clinical feature is the episodic nature of weakness accompanied by documented hypokalemia during attacks. Diagnostic clues include a family history of similar episodes and precipitating factors such as high carbohydrate intake or rest after exercise. Recognizing these features is crucial as other causes of periodic paralysis, such as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis or thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, have different biochemical profiles and management strategies.", "classification_and_nosology": "Hypokalemic periodic paralysis belongs to the group of primary periodic paralyses, which are inherited neuromuscular channelopathies. These disorders are classified based on serum potassium levels during attacks: hypokalemic periodic paralysis (low potassium), hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (high potassium), and normokalemic periodic paralysis (normal potassium levels). The primary periodic paralyses are part of the broader family of skeletal muscle channelopathies, which also include myotonia congenita and paramyotonia congenita. Classification has evolved with advances in molecular genetics, allowing genotype-phenotype correlations. Current nosology emphasizes the genetic basis and electrolyte disturbances, aiding in precise diagnosis and targeted therapy. Controversies remain regarding overlap syndromes and the role of secondary causes of periodic paralysis, such as thyrotoxicosis, which is classified separately as acquired periodic paralysis.", "diagnostic_approach": "The diagnostic approach to a patient with episodic muscle weakness includes a detailed history focusing on attack characteristics, triggers, and family history, followed by targeted laboratory testing. The cornerstone test is measurement of serum potassium during an attack, as hypokalemia confirms hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Additional tests include serum thyroid function tests to exclude thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, creatine kinase to assess muscle injury, and electromyography (EMG) which may show reduced compound muscle action potentials during attacks. Provocative testing with glucose or insulin can be used in specialized settings but carries risks. Genetic testing for CACNA1S and SCN4A mutations supports diagnosis and counseling. It is critical to interpret potassium levels in the clinical context, as normal potassium between attacks does not exclude the diagnosis.", "management_principles": "According to the 2018 European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines on muscle channelopathies, the management of hypokalemic periodic paralysis centers on acute correction of hypokalemia and long-term prevention of attacks. Acute attacks require cautious oral or intravenous potassium supplementation to restore normal serum potassium and muscle strength. Prophylactic treatment includes carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide, which reduce attack frequency by stabilizing membrane excitability, although their exact mechanism remains incompletely understood. Lifestyle modifications to avoid known triggers (high carbohydrate meals, rest after exercise) are essential. Potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone may be used in refractory cases. Avoidance of medications that exacerbate hypokalemia is also important. Long-term management aims to prevent permanent muscle weakness from repeated attacks.

Fundamentally, it represents an acute, monophasic inflammatory neuropathy leading to demyelination and conduction block in peripheral nerves. This results in weakness, sensory disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes motor and sensory axons enveloped by Schwann cells producing myelin, essential for rapid saltatory conduction. In AIDP, the immune system targets Schwann cell membranes, disrupting myelin integrity and impairing nerve conduction. This contrasts with central nervous system (CNS) demyelination, which involves oligodendrocytes. The pathophysiology involves both humoral and cellular immune responses, including molecular mimicry after infections or vaccinations.

Understanding the neuroanatomy of peripheral nerves, including motor and sensory fibers and their myelination, is critical to grasping the clinical manifestations and electrophysiological findings in AIDP.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "AIDP pathogenesis is driven by an aberrant immune response targeting peripheral nerve myelin. Antecedent infections, such as Campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus, or influenza vaccination, trigger molecular mimicry, where antibodies and T-cells cross-react with peripheral nerve components (e.g., gangliosides GM1, GD1a). This immune attack leads to complement activation, macrophage infiltration, and demyelination. Demyelination disrupts saltatory conduction, causing conduction slowing or block, resulting in weakness and sensory symptoms. Autonomic fibers may also be affected, causing dysautonomia such as hyperhidrosis. The temporal sequence starts with immune sensitization (days to weeks post-trigger), followed by clinical symptom onset with progressive weakness and sensory changes over days to weeks. Inflammatory infiltrates and segmental demyelination are hallmarks on nerve biopsy, though rarely performed. The epigastric pain may relate to autonomic involvement or neuropathic pain.

Additionally, AIP neuropathy does not present with albuminocytologic dissociation or demyelination on nerve conduction studies.\n\nOption B: Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP) - Correct. The clinical presentation of progressive, symmetric, ascending weakness following an influenza vaccination, with sensory symptoms and autonomic signs (hyperhidrosis), fits classic AIDP.

AIDP is characterized by demyelinating neuropathy confirmed by electrophysiology and CSF findings.\n\nOption C: Acute Spinal Cord Lesion - Incorrect. Acute spinal cord pathology (e.g., transverse myelitis, spinal cord infarct) would present with upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia), sensory level, and bladder/bowel dysfunction. The absence of these signs and presence of peripheral neuropathy symptoms argue against this diagnosis.

The PCOM artery is a common site for aneurysms, located at the junction of the internal carotid artery and the PCOM, part of the circle of Willis. The circle of Willis provides collateral blood flow between the anterior and posterior circulations, but aneurysms here pose a high risk of rupture due to hemodynamic stress and vessel wall weakness. Management focuses on securing the aneurysm to prevent rebleeding, which carries a high mortality and morbidity risk. Treatment modalities include surgical clipping and endovascular coiling, both aiming to isolate the aneurysm from circulation and promote thrombosis within the sac. Understanding neurovascular anatomy, the hemodynamics of cerebral circulation, and the natural course of aneurysmal rupture is key to grasping management strategies.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Rupture of a PCOM aneurysm leads to bleeding into the subarachnoid space, causing a sudden increase in intracranial pressure and irritation of the meninges. The initial hemorrhage can cause global cerebral ischemia due to increased intracranial pressure and decreased cerebral perfusion pressure. The blood breakdown products induce vasospasm of cerebral arteries, typically peaking 4-14 days post-rupture, which can cause delayed cerebral ischemia. On a cellular level, endothelial injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress contribute to vessel wall dysfunction and cerebral edema. The sequence begins with aneurysm rupture, acute hemorrhage, increased intracranial pressure, meningismus, and risk of rebleeding. Untreated, rebleeding typically occurs early and is associated with high mortality. Thus, early aneurysm obliteration is critical to prevent rebleeding and mitigate secondary brain injury caused by vasospasm and hydrocephalus.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, patients with ruptured PCOM aneurysms present with sudden severe headache ('thunderclap headache'), often described as the worst headache of their life, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and neck stiffness from meningeal irritation. Focal neurological signs such as third nerve palsy (due to PCOM proximity to oculomotor nerve) may be present, causing ptosis and diplopia. Loss of consciousness can occur depending on hemorrhage severity. Diagnosis is confirmed by non-contrast CT showing subarachnoid blood, followed by CT angiography or digital subtraction angiography to identify and characterize the aneurysm. The natural history without treatment includes a high risk of rebleeding (up to 30% within the first weeks), vasospasm, hydrocephalus, and mortality. Prompt aneurysm securing reduces these risks. Key diagnostic findings include SAH on imaging, evidence of vasospasm on transcranial Doppler, and aneurysm morphology on angiography.", "classification_and_nosology": "Intracranial aneurysms are classified primarily by morphology (saccular, fusiform, dissecting), location (anterior vs. posterior circulation), and rupture status (ruptured vs. unruptured).

The World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grading and Hunt and Hess scale classify SAH severity based on clinical presentation, guiding prognosis and treatment urgency.

Once SAH is confirmed, vascular imaging with CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is performed to localize the aneurysm and assess its size and morphology. DSA remains the gold standard for detailed aneurysm characterization. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is used serially to monitor for vasospasm.

First-line treatment is therefore **endovascular coiling**, especially for aneurysms accessible by this route and in patients with higher surgical risk. Surgical clipping remains an option if coiling is contraindicated or incomplete. Acute management also includes blood pressure control, nimodipine administration to reduce vasospasm risk, and monitoring in a neurocritical care or stroke unit.

Admission to a stroke unit is important but insufficient as sole management.", "option_analysis": "Option A (Clipping): While surgical clipping is a definitive treatment for aneurysms, it is more invasive, associated with longer recovery, and generally reserved when coiling is not feasible or aneurysm morphology favors clipping. In PCOM aneurysms, coiling has shown better functional outcomes and lower complication rates, making clipping less preferred in the acute setting. Thus, clipping is not the first-line choice here.\n\nOption B (Coiling): This is the correct answer. Endovascular coiling involves placing detachable platinum coils into the aneurysm sac via catheterization, promoting thrombosis and preventing blood flow into the aneurysm.

The ISAT trial and subsequent studies support coiling as first-line for ruptured aneurysms amenable to this approach.\n\nOption C (Decompressive craniotomy): This is indicated for malignant cerebral edema or refractory intracranial hypertension but is not a treatment for the aneurysm itself. It does not prevent rebleeding or address the underlying vascular lesion. Therefore, it is not appropriate as initial management for a ruptured PCOM aneurysm.\n\nOption D (Admission to stroke unit): While care in a stroke or neurocritical care unit is essential for monitoring and supportive management, admission alone does not secure the aneurysm.

Fundamentally, it involves dysfunction in skeletal muscle ion channels, leading to abnormal muscle membrane excitability and resultant paralysis during attacks. The condition exemplifies how ion channel defects can cause episodic neuromuscular symptoms without permanent structural damage. \n\nAt a more advanced level, HypoPP is primarily caused by mutations in voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA1S gene) or sodium channels (SCN4A gene), which disrupt normal ion flux across muscle membranes. This leads to paradoxical depolarization during hypokalemia, rendering muscle fibers inexcitable. The neuroanatomy involved centers on skeletal muscle fibers and their ion channels, with no primary involvement of the central nervous system or peripheral nerves. Understanding this pathophysiology requires knowledge of muscle membrane potentials, the role of potassium in maintaining resting potential, and how channelopathies alter excitability thresholds.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Hypokalemic periodic paralysis results from inherited mutations in ion channel genes, primarily CACNA1S (encoding the alpha-1 subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel) or SCN4A (encoding the skeletal muscle sodium channel). These mutations cause abnormal gating properties, leading to an aberrant inward leak current during low extracellular potassium states. \n\nNormally, serum potassium levels maintain the resting membrane potential of muscle cells. When potassium is low, the resting potential hyperpolarizes; however, in HypoPP, the mutated channels cause paradoxical depolarization, inactivating sodium channels and preventing action potential generation, hence muscle weakness or paralysis. \n\nEpisodes are often precipitated by factors that reduce serum potassium further, such as carbohydrate-rich meals, rest after exercise, or stress. Repeated episodes can cause muscle damage if untreated. The molecular changes translate clinically into episodic flaccid paralysis with hyporeflexia and low serum potassium during attacks.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, HypoPP presents as transient episodes of generalized muscle weakness or paralysis, typically starting in adolescence or early adulthood, with a male predominance. Attacks often last hours to days and can be triggered by rest after exercise, high carbohydrate intake, or stress. \n\nOn examination during attacks, patients exhibit flaccid weakness, hyporeflexia or areflexia, and low serum potassium (usually <3.0 mEq/L). Between attacks, strength and reflexes are normal. Recurrent attacks may lead to fixed proximal muscle weakness over time. The natural history involves episodic paralysis with potential progression to permanent weakness if untreated. \n\nDiagnosis is supported by clinical history, documented hypokalemia during attacks, and exclusion of secondary causes.

The sensory symptoms and areflexia fit, but the sudden focal deficit is less typical.\n\nOption C (Multifocal Motor Neuropathy, MMN) is characterized by asymmetric distal limb weakness, often presenting with foot drop, without significant sensory loss (though mild sensory symptoms can occasionally occur). Areflexia is common. The sudden foot drop and asymmetric weakness fit MMN better than CIDP. The presence of sensory symptoms is a slight caveat but can be mild or due to coexisting neuropathy. MMN is more common in middle-aged men and fits the clinical picture of asymmetric distal weakness with areflexia and focal deficits.\n\nOption D (ALS) involves both upper and lower motor neuron signs, typically without sensory symptoms. The presence of sensory symptoms and areflexia argues against ALS. Also, ALS does not typically present with isolated foot drop and sensory complaints.\n\nGiven the asymmetric weakness with sudden foot drop and areflexia, MMN best fits the clinical presentation.

Understanding the distinction between demyelinating and axonal neuropathies, as well as differentiating motor from sensory involvement, is critical for accurate diagnosis and management. The peripheral nervous system consists of motor neurons, sensory neurons, and their myelin sheaths, primarily organized as peripheral nerves that transmit signals between the central nervous system and muscles or sensory receptors. Motor neurons control muscle contraction, while sensory neurons convey sensations such as pain, temperature, and proprioception. Neuropathies may affect these components selectively or in combination. For example, purely motor neuropathies affect only motor fibers, sensory neuropathies affect only sensory fibers, and sensorimotor neuropathies involve both. Demyelinating neuropathies impair the insulating myelin sheath, leading to slowed conduction velocities, whereas axonal neuropathies primarily damage the axon itself, resulting in reduced amplitude of nerve signals. A detailed clinical history, neurological examination, and electrophysiological studies enable clinicians to localize and characterize the neuropathy, guiding further diagnostic and therapeutic steps.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is an immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy characterized by multifocal conduction block in motor nerves without sensory involvement. It involves an autoimmune attack against motor nerve myelin, often associated with anti-GM1 ganglioside antibodies. The pathophysiology centers on segmental demyelination causing conduction block, which leads to weakness in affected muscles. Unlike chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), MMN typically spares sensory fibers, explaining the absence of sensory symptoms. The conduction block results from focal demyelination that disrupts saltatory conduction along motor axons. Over time, secondary axonal degeneration may occur if untreated. The immune-mediated nature is supported by response to immunomodulatory therapies and presence of specific antibodies. In contrast, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons with no immune-mediated demyelination. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder caused by autoantibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to impaired acetylcholine release. Thus, each condition has distinct underlying mechanisms that manifest as different clinical and electrophysiological features.", "clinical_correlation": "The patient\u2019s presentation of progressive lower limb weakness with sensory symptoms (tingling and numbness) over three months followed by sudden right foot drop and examination showing weakness with areflexia suggests a peripheral neuropathy with motor predominance. MMN classically presents with asymmetric distal limb weakness, often in the upper limbs but can involve lower limbs, with minimal or no sensory symptoms. The sudden foot drop reflects focal motor nerve involvement due to conduction block. Areflexia is consistent with peripheral nerve involvement. Sensory symptoms are typically absent or minimal in MMN; however, mild sensory complaints may occasionally occur, possibly due to coexisting mild sensory neuropathy or misinterpretation. CIDP usually presents with symmetric, progressive sensorimotor neuropathy with prominent sensory loss, areflexia, and proximal and distal weakness. The presence of sensory symptoms and a more symmetric pattern favors CIDP. ALS presents with combined upper and lower motor neuron signs without sensory loss and typically no areflexia; sensory symptoms are not a feature. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome presents with proximal muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms but does not cause sensory symptoms or areflexia.

In MMN, NCS typically show multifocal motor conduction blocks without sensory nerve involvement. Sensory nerve action potentials remain normal. In CIDP, NCS reveal demyelination in both motor and sensory nerves with prolonged distal latencies, conduction slowing, and temporal dispersion. EMG may show denervation in affected muscles. 3) Laboratory testing: Anti-GM1 IgM antibodies are detected in approximately 50% of MMN cases and support diagnosis. 4) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis: May show mild protein elevation in CIDP but is usually normal in MMN. 5) Imaging: MRI may be used to exclude structural causes.

Typical dosing is 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days, with maintenance infusions as needed. Cyclophosphamide and other immunosuppressants may be considered in refractory cases. In contrast, CIDP responds well to corticosteroids, IVIG, and plasma exchange. ALS management focuses on supportive care and disease-modifying agents like riluzole; immunotherapy is not effective.

Axonal neuropathies primarily affect the nerve axon, leading to distal weakness, sensory loss, and often pain. Autonomic involvement in neuropathy manifests as symptoms such as urinary incontinence, orthostatic hypotension, and gastrointestinal dysmotility, reflecting dysfunction of small unmyelinated or thinly myelinated autonomic fibers. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a common entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist, can coexist with systemic neuropathies, particularly in conditions causing generalized axonal damage. Understanding the neuroanatomy of peripheral nerves and the physiology of autonomic fibers is crucial to interpreting clinical presentations and guiding investigations. The median nerve contains motor and sensory fibers, while autonomic fibers are distributed along peripheral nerves and regulate visceral functions. The presence of painful neuropathy with autonomic symptoms suggests a systemic or metabolic cause affecting small fibers and autonomic ganglia.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Axonal neuropathies result from direct injury or metabolic disturbances that damage the nerve axon or its mitochondria, impairing axonal transport and leading to distal degeneration. Small fiber neuropathy, which includes autonomic fibers, can manifest with pain and autonomic dysfunction due to selective vulnerability of these fibers to metabolic or toxic insults. In systemic diseases such as amyloidosis or paraproteinemias, abnormal protein deposition or immune-mediated mechanisms cause axonal degeneration and autonomic fiber involvement. Carpal tunnel syndrome arises from compression-induced ischemia and demyelination of the median nerve at the wrist, which can be superimposed on a generalized neuropathy. The combination of painful axonal neuropathy with autonomic symptoms and CTS raises suspicion for systemic infiltrative or paraproteinemic neuropathies where amyloid or abnormal immunoglobulins deposit in nerves, causing axonal loss and autonomic failure.", "clinical_correlation": "Patients with axonal neuropathy involving autonomic fibers typically present with distal sensory loss, burning pain, and autonomic symptoms such as urinary incontinence, orthostatic hypotension, or gastrointestinal disturbances.

The fundamental principle in acute stroke management is the timely restoration of cerebral perfusion to salvage the ischemic penumbra\u2014the area of brain tissue at risk but not yet infarcted. The window for effective reperfusion therapy is limited because prolonged ischemia leads to irreversible neuronal death. Neuroanatomically, the brain\u2019s blood supply is divided among the anterior and posterior circulations, with ischemic symptoms reflecting the involved vascular territory. From a neurophysiological perspective, ischemia disrupts neuronal metabolism, ionic gradients, and neurotransmitter homeostasis, initiating a cascade of excitotoxicity and inflammation. Understanding the temporal evolution of ischemic injury and the clinical correlation with symptom onset is critical for therapeutic decision-making.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Ischemic stroke pathophysiology begins with arterial occlusion, commonly due to thromboembolism or in situ thrombosis. This causes immediate cessation of oxygen and glucose delivery, leading to energy failure and loss of ATP-dependent ion pump function. Neurons depolarize, releasing excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate, which activate NMDA receptors, causing calcium influx and triggering cell death pathways. The ischemic core undergoes rapid necrosis, while the surrounding penumbra is functionally impaired but potentially salvageable. Over hours to days, inflammatory cells infiltrate, exacerbating injury through oxidative stress and cytokine release. The timing of these events underpins the therapeutic window for interventions like intravenous thrombolysis. Molecularly, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, promoting fibrin clot degradation and reperfusion.

The two main categories of myotonic disorders include chloride channel myotonias (e.g., Thomsen and Becker diseases) and sodium channel myotonias (e.g., paramyotonia congenita). Thomsen disease is an autosomal dominant chloride channelopathy with mild myotonia and warm-up phenomenon. Becker disease is recessive and more severe. Paramyotonia congenita, an autosomal dominant sodium channelopathy, is distinguished by paradoxical myotonia and cold sensitivity. These disorders belong to the broader group of non-dystrophic myotonias. Classification has evolved with genetic discoveries, emphasizing genotype-phenotype correlations. Current consensus integrates clinical features, electrophysiology, and molecular genetics to classify and diagnose these disorders accurately. Controversies persist regarding overlap syndromes and the spectrum of sodium channelopathies, but PMC remains a well-defined entity within this nosology.", "diagnostic_approach": "Diagnosis of paramyotonia congenita involves a combination of clinical evaluation, family history, electrophysiological studies, and genetic testing. Key steps include:  \n- Detailed history focusing on symptom triggers (cold, exercise) and progression  \n- Neurological examination noting myotonia and transient weakness  \n- Electromyography (EMG) demonstrating myotonic discharges that worsen with cold exposure and repeated activation (paradoxical myotonia)  \n- Genetic testing for SCN4A mutations confirms diagnosis  \nEMG cold testing is particularly sensitive for PMC, distinguishing it from chloride channel myotonias.

Thomsen disease is a chloride channel myotonia due to CLCN1 mutations. It typically presents with myotonia that improves with repeated movements (warm-up phenomenon) and is not worsened by cold. The clinical history of cramps and stiffness that worsen with activity and cold, plus the family history, fits poorly with Thomsen disease. EMG and genetic testing would differentiate it.  \nOption B: Paramyotonia congenita \u2014 Correct. PMC is characterized by paradoxical myotonia (stiffness worsens with repeated use), cold sensitivity, and autosomal dominant inheritance. The patient's history of cramps and stiffness relieved by movement is somewhat atypical but can be interpreted as the patient experiencing stiffness that is triggered or worsened by activity and cold, consistent with PMC. The familial occurrence supports this diagnosis. EMG with cold testing and SCN4A mutation confirmation clinch the diagnosis.  \nDiscriminating features: Warm-up phenomenon (improves stiffness) favors Thomsen; paradoxical myotonia (worsens stiffness) and cold sensitivity favor PMC.

Clinically, patients often present with multisystem involvement including neurological symptoms such as stroke-like episodes, seizures, myoclonus, sensorineural deafness, and visual disturbances. Understanding the neuroanatomical basis involves recognizing that mitochondrial dysfunction affects neurons and glial cells, especially in cortical and subcortical regions, resulting in metabolic stroke-like lesions distinct from vascular strokes.

Understanding this pattern requires integrating knowledge of cortical neuron membrane potentials, synaptic transmission, and the influence of systemic and pharmacologic factors on neuronal excitability.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "The pathophysiology underlying burst suppression involves profound cortical and subcortical neuronal dysfunction. At the cellular level, metabolic failure, hypoxia, or toxic insults impair ATP-dependent ion pumps, leading to neuronal hyperpolarization and decreased synaptic transmission during suppression phases. The bursts correspond to transient recovery of excitability, possibly due to intermittent restoration of ionic gradients or intrinsic pacemaker activity within thalamocortical circuits. Molecularly, there is altered neurotransmitter release, particularly involving glutamate and GABA, and disruption of cortical network synchrony. In critical illness, systemic factors such as hypothermia, sedative medications (e.g., barbiturates, propofol), or severe encephalopathy modulate these mechanisms. The presence of burst suppression thus signals a severe disturbance in brain metabolism and connectivity, often correlating with poor neurological function.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, burst suppression is most commonly observed in comatose patients with severe brain injury, including anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest, severe traumatic brain injury, or deep sedation in the intensive care unit. The EEG pattern correlates with a depressed level of consciousness and often portends a poor neurological outcome. However, burst suppression can also be induced therapeutically (e.g., barbiturate coma for refractory status epilepticus), in which case its prognostic significance differs. The natural history depends on etiology: spontaneous burst suppression after hypoxic injury often predicts poor recovery, whereas induced burst suppression may be reversible. Key diagnostic findings include the characteristic alternating high-amplitude bursts and low-amplitude suppressions, usually quantified by suppression ratio and burst duration. Importantly, the presence of burst suppression alone is insufficient to definitively predict outcome without clinical context.", "classification_and_nosology": "Burst suppression is classified as a specific EEG pattern within the broader category of encephalopathic EEG abnormalities. According to the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's standardized critical care EEG terminology, burst suppression is defined by alternating periods of suppression (amplitude <10 \u00b5V) lasting \u22650.5 seconds interspersed with bursts of mixed-frequency activity. It is distinct from other patterns such as generalized periodic discharges or alpha coma. Nosologically, burst suppression can be spontaneous or pharmacologically induced, and this distinction is critical for prognosis and management. The pattern is categorized under severe encephalopathy and is often considered a marker of severe cortical dysfunction. There is ongoing debate regarding its prognostic implications, especially in heterogeneous patient populations, leading to evolving consensus guidelines.", "diagnostic_approach": "The diagnostic approach to burst suppression relies primarily on continuous EEG monitoring in critically ill patients. Key steps include:  \n- Confirming the pattern meets criteria: alternating bursts and suppressions with suppression amplitude <10 \u00b5V and duration \u22650.5 seconds.  \n- Differentiating spontaneous versus induced burst suppression by reviewing medication history (e.g., barbiturates, propofol).  \n- Correlating EEG findings with clinical examination and neuroimaging to determine etiology.  \n- Utilizing quantitative EEG metrics, such as suppression ratio and burst duration, to assess severity.  \n- Excluding technical artifacts or electrode issues that can mimic burst suppression.  \nSensitivity of EEG for detecting burst suppression is high, but specificity for prognosis is limited without clinical context.

The fundamental neurological principle underlying seizure management is that a single unprovoked seizure does not necessarily indicate epilepsy, which is a chronic predisposition to recurrent unprovoked seizures. The decision to start antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) hinges on the risk of recurrence and the impact of treatment on patient quality of life. Neuroanatomically, seizures arise from abnormal, hypersynchronous neuronal discharges primarily in the cerebral cortex. The pathophysiology involves an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, often with excessive glutamatergic activity and reduced GABAergic inhibition. This imbalance leads to the generation and propagation of epileptiform activity. Understanding the distinction between a single seizure and epilepsy is critical, as it guides diagnostic evaluation and management strategies.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "The pathophysiology of unprovoked seizures involves a complex interplay of neuronal hyperexcitability and network hypersynchronization. Molecularly, alterations in ion channel function (e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium channels), neurotransmitter receptor abnormalities, and changes in synaptic plasticity contribute to seizure genesis. Cellular changes include increased excitatory postsynaptic potentials and decreased inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, facilitating paroxysmal depolarizing shifts. The etiology of unprovoked seizures can be idiopathic or symptomatic due to underlying structural brain abnormalities, genetic predispositions, or metabolic derangements. However, in patients with normal labs and no clear provoking factors, the mechanism likely involves subtle cortical hyperexcitability or microstructural abnormalities undetectable without advanced imaging or EEG. The sequence begins with aberrant neuronal firing, which can either self-terminate or evolve into clinical seizures. The risk of recurrence depends on the presence of epileptiform abnormalities on EEG or structural lesions on MRI.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, unprovoked seizures typically present as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or focal seizures with or without impaired awareness. In this scenario, the patient has had three unprovoked seizures but has returned to baseline neurologically, and all routine labs are normal. This presentation raises the question of epilepsy diagnosis and treatment initiation. The absence of acute symptomatic causes and normal labs suggest a diagnosis of epilepsy after multiple unprovoked seizures. However, immediate initiation of AEDs is not always warranted without further evaluation. EEG can detect epileptiform discharges that increase recurrence risk, and MRI can identify structural lesions that may influence prognosis and management. The natural history of epilepsy varies; some patients may have infrequent seizures and may not require immediate AEDs, whereas others with high recurrence risk benefit from early treatment. Diagnostic findings such as interictal epileptiform discharges on EEG or MRI abnormalities guide risk stratification.", "classification_and_nosology": "The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classifies seizures into focal, generalized, and unknown onset, with epilepsy defined by at least two unprovoked seizures occurring >24 hours apart or a single seizure with high recurrence risk. This patient's presentation fits the epilepsy diagnosis after three unprovoked seizures. The nosology includes idiopathic (genetic), structural/metabolic, and unknown etiologies. The current consensus emphasizes a comprehensive evaluation including clinical history, EEG, and neuroimaging before labeling epilepsy and initiating therapy. This approach balances the risks of unnecessary AED exposure against the morbidity of recurrent seizures. The classification has evolved from purely clinical to incorporating electroclinical syndromes and etiological factors, improving individualized management.", "diagnostic_approach": "A systematic diagnostic approach for unprovoked seizures includes detailed history, neurological examination, routine labs to exclude metabolic causes, EEG, and brain MRI. EEG is sensitive for detecting interictal epileptiform discharges that predict seizure recurrence with approximately 60% sensitivity and high specificity. MRI with epilepsy protocol identifies structural lesions such as mesial temporal sclerosis, cortical dysplasia, tumors, or vascular malformations. In this case, since the patient returned to baseline and labs are normal, immediate AED initiation is not mandatory.

The fundamental neurological principle involved is that voluntary hyperventilation leads to cerebral vasoconstriction due to respiratory alkalosis, which in turn modulates cortical excitability and EEG patterns. At a basic level, hyperventilation reduces arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), causing cerebral blood vessels to constrict and transiently decreasing cerebral blood flow. This physiological change affects neuronal membrane potentials and synaptic transmission, leading to characteristic EEG changes. More complex understanding recognizes that hyperventilation-induced alkalosis alters ion channel function and neurotransmitter release, particularly enhancing excitability in thalamocortical circuits, which is why it can provoke generalized epileptiform discharges or specific EEG rhythm changes.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "The pathophysiology behind hyperventilation-induced EEG changes involves several interconnected mechanisms. Hyperventilation lowers PaCO2, causing respiratory alkalosis. This alkalosis leads to cerebral vasoconstriction and reduced cerebral blood flow, especially in the anterior brain regions supplied by the anterior cerebral artery. The resultant mild hypoxia and altered pH affect neuronal excitability by modulating ion channels and neurotransmitter systems (e.g., increased excitatory glutamatergic transmission and decreased inhibitory GABAergic tone). These changes predominantly affect the frontocentral cortical areas, leading to increased synchronization of neuronal firing manifesting as anterior dominant slowing in the theta and delta range on EEG. In patients with generalized epilepsy, this environment can trigger spike-and-wave discharges, but in normal individuals, the typical response is an increase in anterior slow waves, particularly theta and delta frequencies.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, hyperventilation is used during EEG to activate or enhance epileptiform activity, especially in pediatric and young adult patients with absence seizures or generalized epilepsy. The classic normal EEG response to hyperventilation is a transient increase in **anterior dominant theta and delta slowing** lasting up to several minutes. This slowing reflects physiological cortical responses to altered cerebral metabolism and blood flow. In contrast, pathological responses include generalized spike-and-wave discharges or focal epileptiform discharges. The normal slowing is usually symmetric, maximal over the frontal regions, and disappears with cessation of hyperventilation. Recognizing this pattern is crucial to avoid misinterpretation as abnormal slowing or seizure activity. The natural history of this response is benign; it does not indicate pathology but rather a normal physiological reaction. Key diagnostic findings include the topographic predominance (anterior), frequency range (theta/delta), and reversibility after hyperventilation ends.", "classification_and_nosology": "The EEG changes induced by hyperventilation fall under the category of **activation procedures** in EEG studies. These are standardized maneuvers used to increase the yield of EEG in detecting epileptiform abnormalities. Within the classification of EEG patterns, the normal hyperventilation response is classified as **physiological anterior slowing**. This contrasts with pathological patterns such as generalized spike-and-wave complexes seen in absence epilepsy or focal epileptiform discharges. The International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) guidelines classify EEG patterns into normal variants, physiological responses, and epileptiform abnormalities; hyperventilation-induced anterior theta/delta slowing is a well-recognized physiological response. There is consensus in the epilepsy and clinical neurophysiology communities regarding these classifications, with no significant controversies, although interpretation requires clinical correlation.", "diagnostic_approach": "When performing EEG, hyperventilation is typically requested for 3-5 minutes to provoke changes. The diagnostic approach involves monitoring for the normal physiological response versus pathological epileptiform activity. Electrodes over the frontal and central regions are carefully observed for the emergence of anterior dominant slowing in the theta (4-7 Hz) and delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) ranges. The sensitivity of hyperventilation to provoke epileptiform discharges is highest in generalized epilepsies, especially absence seizures, but in normal individuals, the expected finding is anterior theta/delta slowing. Interpretation requires distinguishing between normal slowing and abnormal spike-wave complexes. The EEG technician and neurologist must be familiar with these patterns to avoid false positives. Current EEG interpretation criteria emphasize the importance of topography, frequency, morphology, and reversibility of changes induced by hyperventilation.", "management_principles": "Management in the context of EEG hyperventilation response is primarily diagnostic rather than therapeutic. The procedure is safe and routinely used to enhance the detection of epileptiform activity. According to the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) guidelines (2016), hyperventilation is a recommended activation procedure in routine EEG for suspected generalized epilepsies. No treatment is required for the normal anterior theta/delta slowing response; it is a physiological phenomenon. If hyperventilation provokes epileptiform discharges, management then follows epilepsy treatment guidelines, including antiseizure medications tailored to the epilepsy syndrome.

Fundamentally, epilepsy involves an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks, leading to hyperexcitability and synchronous neuronal firing. In LGS, this imbalance is profound and multifactorial, resulting in refractory seizures that are often resistant to conventional antiseizure medications. Neuroanatomically, LGS is linked to diffuse brain dysfunction involving cortical and subcortical structures, with widespread disruption of neural circuits that regulate excitability and cognition. The syndrome exemplifies a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, structural brain abnormalities, and secondary epileptogenesis, necessitating an integrated understanding of neurodevelopment, synaptic physiology, and network dynamics.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "LGS pathophysiology involves widespread cortical and subcortical neuronal network dysfunction, leading to multiple seizure types including tonic, atonic, atypical absence, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Molecularly, alterations in ion channel function, neurotransmitter imbalances (notably GABAergic inhibition and glutamatergic excitation), and abnormal synaptic plasticity contribute to persistent hyperexcitability. Structural brain abnormalities such as cortical dysplasia, tuberous sclerosis, or hypoxic-ischemic injury often underlie LGS, promoting epileptogenesis through aberrant neural connectivity. The characteristic slow spike-and-wave EEG pattern reflects abnormal thalamocortical oscillations. Progressive cognitive impairment arises from recurrent seizures and epileptic encephalopathy, where epileptic activity itself disrupts normal brain development and function.", "clinical_correlation": "Clinically, LGS presents with multiple seizure types: tonic seizures often occur during sleep and are highly disabling; atonic seizures cause sudden falls and injuries; atypical absences manifest as brief lapses in awareness; and generalized tonic-clonic seizures are common. Cognitive delay or regression is universal, often evident before or shortly after seizure onset. EEG hallmark features include slow (<2.5 Hz) spike-and-wave discharges interspersed with paroxysmal fast activity, predominantly during sleep.

LGS is distinct from other generalized epilepsies due to its mixed seizure semiology and refractory nature.

Valproate enhances GABAergic inhibition and modulates sodium and T-type calcium channels, reducing neuronal excitability. Second-line agents include lamotrigine, topiramate, rufinamide, clobazam, and cannabidiol, often used in combination due to the refractory nature of LGS. Carbamazepine (A) is generally avoided as it may exacerbate seizures in generalized epilepsies like LGS. Levetiracetam (Keppra) has variable efficacy but is sometimes used adjunctively.

Seizures result from abnormal, excessive, synchronous neuronal discharges in the brain. Effective seizure control requires modulation of neuronal excitability via antiseizure medications (ASMs) that target ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, or synaptic release mechanisms. Lamotrigine, the patient's current medication, primarily acts by stabilizing voltage-gated sodium channels and inhibiting glutamate release, thus reducing excitatory neurotransmission. However, refractory seizures necessitate adjunctive therapy to achieve optimal control. Understanding the neuropharmacology of ASMs and their interaction with seizure pathophysiology is essential for effective management.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "Generalized tonic-clonic seizures involve widespread cortical neuronal hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony, implicating both excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neurotransmission imbalances.

At a fundamental level, epilepsy is a disorder characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures due to abnormal, hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. The mesial temporal lobe (MTL), comprising structures such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus, is a common epileptogenic zone, especially in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The MTL is critical for memory and emotional processing, and its complex circuitry predisposes it to epileptogenesis through mechanisms like neuronal loss, gliosis, and synaptic reorganization. Understanding breakthrough seizures requires integrating neurophysiology of seizure generation, AED pharmacodynamics, and patient factors influencing seizure threshold.", "pathophysiological_mechanisms": "In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, the epileptogenic focus arises from structural and functional alterations in the hippocampus and adjacent limbic structures, often due to hippocampal sclerosis. Pathophysiologically, this involves neuronal loss, mossy fiber sprouting, and altered excitatory/inhibitory balance leading to hyperexcitability. AEDs act by modulating ion channels, enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission (GABAergic), or reducing excitatory neurotransmission (glutamatergic). Breakthrough seizures occur when the balance shifts back towards hyperexcitability, which can be triggered by subtherapeutic drug levels, metabolic factors, or external precipitants. Non-adherence leads to decreased plasma AED concentration, allowing neuronal hyperexcitability to manifest clinically as seizures.", "clinical_correlation": "Patients with MTL epilepsy typically present with focal impaired awareness seizures characterized by aura (epigastric rising sensation, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu), automatisms, and postictal confusion. Breakthrough seizures in such patients signal a disruption in seizure control, often due to modifiable factors. Clinically, breakthrough seizures may present similarly to prior seizures but imply a loss of previously achieved remission. Recognizing breakthrough seizures is crucial because they increase morbidity, risk of status epilepticus, and impact quality of life. Key diagnostic clues include medication history, serum AED levels, and potential precipitating factors such as sleep deprivation or illness.", "classification_and_nosology": "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is classified under focal epilepsies in the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2017 classification. It is part of the structural/metabolic epilepsy subgroup when associated with hippocampal sclerosis. Breakthrough seizures are not a separate epilepsy type but a clinical phenomenon indicating incomplete seizure control. Understanding the nosology helps differentiate between epilepsy syndrome progression versus reversible causes of seizure recurrence. The ILAE emphasizes seizure control status and etiology in classification, guiding management decisions.", "diagnostic_approach": "Evaluation of breakthrough seizures involves a systematic approach: (1) Confirm seizure recurrence and characterize seizure type; (2) Review medication adherence and dosing history; (3) Measure serum AED levels to detect subtherapeutic concentrations; (4) Assess for precipitating factors (infection, sleep deprivation, metabolic derangements); (5) Consider EEG to identify ongoing epileptiform activity and MRI to rule out new structural lesions. Sensitivity of serum AED levels varies by drug but is critical to identify non-adherence or pharmacokinetic changes. Diagnosis relies on clinical correlation and exclusion of alternative causes.", "management_principles": "According to the American Epilepsy Society (AES) 2021 guidelines, first-line management of breakthrough seizures involves addressing reversible causes, primarily ensuring medication adherence. Education on adherence, simplifying regimens, and monitoring serum AED levels are emphasized. If seizures persist despite adherence, dose optimization or AED changes may be warranted. The mechanism of AEDs\u2014such as sodium channel blockade (carbamazepine) or GABA potentiation (lamotrigine)\u2014guides selection. Acute management includes seizure safety and status epilepticus protocols if needed. Long-term care focuses on minimizing seizure recurrence and improving quality of life.", "option_analysis": "Option 1 (not commitment to medication): This is the correct answer because non-adherence is the most common and modifiable cause of breakthrough seizures in patients with controlled MTL epilepsy on AEDs. Subtherapeutic drug levels due to missed doses directly reduce seizure threshold, precipitating seizures. Supporting evidence shows adherence correlates strongly with seizure control.\n\nOption 2 (MTL epilepsy): This option is incorrect as a cause of breakthrough seizures because the diagnosis of MTL epilepsy itself does not explain seizure recurrence once the patient is on adequate therapy. The underlying epilepsy is the baseline condition, not an acute cause of breakthrough seizures. Seizures occurring despite therapy usually reflect external factors rather than progression of the epilepsy syndrome.", "clinical_pearls": "- Always assess medication adherence first in breakthrough seizures before escalating therapy.\n- Measure serum AED levels to confirm adherence and therapeutic range.\n- Educate patients on the importance of compliance and identify barriers.\n- Remember that breakthrough seizures do not necessarily indicate disease progression.\n- Use seizure diaries and caregiver reports to monitor seizure patterns.\n- Simplify AED regimens to improve adherence when possible.\n- Consider other triggers such as sleep deprivation, stress, and metabolic disturbances.\n- MTL epilepsy seizures often have characteristic auras and automatisms aiding diagnosis.", "current_evidence": "The 2021 American Epilepsy Society guidelines state: \u201cIn patients with breakthrough seizures, the initial evaluation should prioritize assessment of adherence and serum AED levels to identify subtherapeutic dosing as a reversible cause.\u201d (AES, 2021). Recent studies reinforce that non-adherence accounts for up to 50% of breakthrough seizures. There remains a knowledge gap in standardized approaches to improve adherence, with ongoing research into digital adherence monitoring. Advances in pharmacogenomics may soon tailor AED therapy to individual metabolism, potentially reducing breakthrough seizures.
