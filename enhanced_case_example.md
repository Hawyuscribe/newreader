## Enhanced Educational Version

### Case Presentation:
**75-year-old female** presents with the following clinical picture:

A 75-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (on metformin and glyburide), hypertension (on amlodipine and lisinopril), hyperlipidemia (on atorvastatin), and osteoporosis (on alendronate and calcium supplements) presents to the emergency department after experiencing her **first witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure**. 

The episode occurred while she was watching television and lasted approximately 2 minutes, with post-ictal confusion lasting 10 minutes before returning to baseline. Family reports no prior seizure history, recent head trauma, alcohol use, or medication non-compliance. Her current medications have been stable for the past year.

Recent laboratory values show: glucose 145 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, liver enzymes within normal limits. She weighs 58 kg and has mild cognitive impairment but lives independently.

**Given this patient's age, comorbidities, and current medications, which antiseizure medication would be the most appropriate first-line choice and why?**

### Educational Enhancement Points:

1. **Drug Interaction Focus**:
   - Emphasizes current medications that could interact
   - Highlights need for careful drug selection

2. **Age-Specific Considerations**:
   - Low body weight (58 kg) affects dosing
   - Mild cognitive impairment impacts drug choice
   - Renal/hepatic function considerations

3. **Specific Clinical Scenario**:
   - First seizure (not established epilepsy)
   - Multiple comorbidities requiring consideration
   - Real-world medication list

4. **Educational Objective Clarity**:
   - Directly asks about drug choice reasoning
   - Emphasizes "why" not just "what"

## Key Learning Points This Enhanced Version Teaches:

### Why Lamotrigine (Correct Answer):
- Minimal drug interactions
- Weight-neutral
- Low cognitive side effects
- Suitable for elderly
- No hepatic enzyme induction

### Why NOT Other Options:
- **Valproate**: Weight gain, osteoporosis risk, drug interactions
- **Phenytoin**: Multiple drug interactions, cognitive effects, osteoporosis
- **Lacosamide**: Cardiac considerations (hypertension)

## Implementation Recommendations:

1. **Fix Demographics Error**
2. **Add Medication Context**
3. **Emphasize Drug Selection Rationale**
4. **Include Relevant Lab Values**
5. **Make Age/Comorbidity Impact Clear**
