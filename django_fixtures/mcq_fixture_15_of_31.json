      "explanation": "Fibromuscular Dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arteriopathy leading to arterial stenosis and occlusion and predisposing to dissection. This condition is more common in women and white persons. It affects the renal vessels most commonly (60%-75%); the extracranial carotid or vertebral arteries are the second most common site (20%-30%). Intracranial vessels and the iliac, femoral, subclavian, and visceral arteries may also be affected. Patients may be asymptomatic, have pulsatile tinnitus, or present with focal cerebral ischemia. Patients may also have hypertension due to involvement of the renal arteries. The diagnosis is based on the angiographic appearance of a “string of beads” or “beading” (ie, alternating constricted and dilated segments generally of the distal cervical carotid). Conventional angiography is superior to MRA; however, gadolinium-enhanced MRA may show changes as well. Treatment involves antiplatelet agents and management of concomitant hypertension if present.",
