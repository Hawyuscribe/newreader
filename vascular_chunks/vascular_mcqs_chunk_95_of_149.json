    "explanation": "This question tests recognition of a selective pattern of muscle weakness. The clinical picture of weakness in the biceps, hip flexors, and knee flexors\u2014with sparing of the deltoid\u2014fits best with a myopathy that has a selective distribution rather than a generalized limb\u2010girdle pattern. In this context, the pattern is most consistent with sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), which selectively affects certain proximal and distal muscles, with a characteristic relative sparing of others. sIBM is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that has overlapping features of both degenerative and inflammatory disorders. Pathologically, muscle biopsy typically shows endomysial inflammation, rimmed vacuoles, and protein accumulations. Cytotoxic T\u2010cells and degenerative mechanisms (including abnormal protein misfolding and aggregation) are implicated. Although typically seen in patients over the age of 50, its selective pattern of involvement (notably the biceps and quadriceps/flexor groups) helps distinguish it from other myopathies. Patients with sIBM often present with a slowly progressive and sometimes asymmetric pattern of weakness. Classic involvement includes the finger flexors and knee extensors; however, weakness in the biceps can also be prominent while other muscles (such as the deltoid) are less affected early on. This unique distribution may help in differentiating sIBM from various muscular dystrophies that tend to have more diffuse involvement. The workup for suspected sIBM includes serum creatine kinase (CK) measurement (often only mildly elevated), electromyography (EMG) to document myopathic features with fibrillations and complex repetitive discharges, and ultimately, a muscle biopsy which is key to the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis (which generally presents with more symmetric proximal weakness and responds to immunosuppression), dermatomyositis, and limb\u2010girdle muscular dystrophies which usually lack the characteristic biopsy findings of sIBM. There is no definitive cure for sIBM. First\u2010line management is supportive including physical and occupational therapy to maintain function and prevent contractures. Although immunosuppressive therapies (such as corticosteroids or other agents) have been used, sIBM generally shows poor response. Some studies have explored intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as an option with variable results. In pregnancy and lactation, because typical immunosuppressants or off\u2010label IVIG use can have risks, treatment is mainly conservative with a focus on supportive care and careful multidisciplinary management should the patient become pregnant. Option A (Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy) is not appropriate because FSHMD generally presents with facial and scapular weakness rather than selective biceps and lower limb flexor involvement. Options C and D, though not provided, would represent other distractors. Option B, interpreted as sporadic inclusion body myositis, best fits the described selective pattern of weakness. \u2022 sIBM is the most common inflammatory myopathy in older adults and is characteristically refractory to immunosuppression.  \u2022 The pattern of weakness (involving finger flexors, biceps, and quadriceps, with relative sparing of other muscles like the deltoid) is a key diagnostic clue.  \u2022 Muscle biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Recent research into sIBM has emphasized its dual inflammatory\u2013degenerative nature, leading to trials of various agents (including IVIG and experimental drugs targeting protein aggregation) with limited success. Consensus guidelines continue to advocate for supportive management, and ongoing studies aim to better understand the molecular pathogenesis to unlock novel therapies.",

    "question": "A young man (or child), who had muscle stiffness that improves with repeated exercise (myotonia and warm up phenomena), his father had the same symptoms, what is most likely diagnosis?",
    "option_a": "Thomson\u2019s disease",
    "option_b": "Myotonic dystrophy",
    "option_c": "?",
    "option_d": "?",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "The question centers on recognizing a hereditary myotonia characterized by muscle stiffness that improves with repeated exercise\u2014a phenomenon known as the warm\u2010up phenomenon. The autosomal dominant form of myotonia congenita, known as Thomsen\u2019s disease, typically presents in children or young adults and can be transmitted from an affected parent. Thomsen\u2019s disease results from mutations in the CLCN1 gene, which encodes the skeletal muscle chloride channel. The defect leads to hyperexcitability of the muscle membrane, causing delayed relaxation after contraction (myotonia). The warm\u2010up phenomenon occurs because repeated contraction partially normalizes the membrane excitability. Patients exhibit muscle stiffness, especially after initiating movement, which classically improves with repeated use (the warm\u2010up phenomenon). The familial occurrence (as noted by the father having similar symptoms) strongly supports an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, distinguishing Thomsen\u2019s disease from the recessive Becker variant. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination, supported by electromyography (EMG) which reveals characteristic myotonic discharges (often described as a 'dive\u2010bomber' sound). Genetic testing can confirm a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Differential diagnoses include myotonic dystrophy\u2014which, unlike myotonia congenita, is associated with multisystem involvement (such as cataracts, cardiac conduction issues, and endocrine abnormalities) and does not show a prominent warm\u2010up phenomenon. First\u2010line management involves symptomatic treatment. Mexiletine, a sodium channel blocker, is widely regarded as the treatment of choice for alleviating myotonia. Other options include carbamazepine or lamotrigine, which may be used if mexiletine is contraindicated or not tolerated. During pregnancy and lactation, careful consideration is warranted: mexiletine is a Category C drug; therefore, if treatment is necessary, benefits and risks must be weighed and close monitoring instituted, with alternative therapies considered if safety concerns arise. Option A, Thomsen\u2019s disease, is correct given the demonstration of the warm\u2010up phenomenon and a positive family history (father affected). Option B (Myotonic dystrophy) is less likely because it typically features multisystem involvement, progressive wasting, and does not characteristically improve with repeated exercise. Options C and D are not provided, but they would likely represent distractor choices. \u2022 The warm\u2010up phenomenon is a hallmark of myotonia congenita.  \u2022 Thomsen\u2019s disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, in contrast to the recessive Becker\u2019s variant.  \u2022 EMG findings of myotonic discharges are instrumental in confirming the diagnosis. Recent clinical studies have validated the efficacy of mexiletine in reducing symptoms of myotonia, and ongoing research is investigating novel agents that target ion channel dysfunction. Genetic counseling is recommended, particularly for families with autosomal dominant inheritance, and current guidelines emphasize careful management of these patients, especially women of childbearing age.",

    "question": "A Filipino patient has muscle stiffness and intermittent weakness, what should be tested for him?",

    "option_c": "?",
    "option_d": "?",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This question tests the recognition of an ethnic and clinical correlation. In individuals of Asian descent (such as Filipinos), episodes of muscle stiffness with intermittent weakness should raise suspicion for a periodic paralysis syndrome related to thyroid dysfunction, most commonly thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is an endocrine-channelopathy associated with hyperthyroidism. Excess thyroid hormone increases beta-adrenergic activity and stimulates the Na+/K+ pump in skeletal muscle, driving potassium intracellularly and resulting in hypokalemia during attacks. The resultant low extracellular potassium impairs normal muscle membrane repolarization and leads to episodic weakness. The condition typically affects young Asian males, though it can occasionally be seen in other ethnic groups. Patients present with episodes of muscle weakness often precipitated by factors such as a high-carbohydrate meal, strenuous exercise, or stress. Muscle stiffness may be noted either during the attack or in between episodes. The demographic (Filipino) along with the episodic nature of the symptoms aligns well with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. The initial diagnostic step is to measure serum potassium levels, typically during an episode where marked hypokalemia is observed. This is followed by thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4/T3) to confirm hyperthyroidism. Differential diagnoses include familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis and other causes of acute muscle weakness (such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), but the ethnic predisposition and association with thyrotoxicosis are distinguishing. Acute management involves careful potassium repletion, with caution given the risk of rebound hyperkalemia. Non-selective beta-blockers (like propranolol) are used to reduce the adrenergic drive that precipitates potassium shifting. Long-term management focuses on achieving a euthyroid state using anti-thyroid medications, radioactive iodine ablation, or surgery. In pregnancy, propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred in the first trimester due to its better safety profile, with a possible switch to methimazole later in pregnancy. Beta-blockers are used judiciously in pregnant and lactating women, balancing maternal benefits with potential fetal or neonatal risks. Option A (Potassium level) is correct because the hallmark laboratory abnormality during an attack of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is hypokalemia. Other options (B, C, and D) are omitted, but given the clinical scenario, the measurement of serum potassium is the most immediate and relevant investigation. \u2022 Always suspect thyrotoxic periodic paralysis in young Asian men with episodic muscle weakness.  \u2022 Serum hypokalemia during attacks is a key diagnostic clue.  \u2022 Evaluation should always include both serum potassium and thyroid function tests. Recent guidelines underscore the importance of early recognition and correction of hypokalemia to prevent complications. There is also renewed focus on comprehensive thyroid evaluation and definitive management of hyperthyroidism to prevent recurrent episodes. Studies have continued to refine the optimal strategies for acute and long-term management, with particular attention to safety in special populations such as pregnant or lactating women.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This question reviews the understanding of the bimodal age distribution of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG typically exhibits an early-onset form, more common in women, and a late-onset form, which is more frequent in men. Recognizing these patterns is crucial for diagnosis and management. MG is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies target components of the neuromuscular junction, most commonly the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). In early-onset MG (predominantly affecting women in their 20s to 30s), thymic hyperplasia is common, whereas late-onset MG (more common in men in their 60s and 70s) may be associated with thymoma or normal thymus histology. Clinically, MG presents with fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability affecting ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles. The bimodal age distribution is well recognized: young women (often in their 3rd decade) and older men (typically in their 6th-7th decades) are most commonly affected. This pattern aids in tailoring diagnostic evaluations and therapeutic interventions. The diagnosis of MG is established by clinical evaluation, serologic testing for antibodies (anti-AChR and anti-MuSK), electrodiagnostic studies (repetitive nerve stimulation or single-fiber EMG), and sometimes imaging (such as CT of the chest to evaluate the thymus). Differential diagnoses include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (which is associated with malignancies and typically affects older individuals) and congenital myasthenic syndromes. Management of MG is tiered. First-line therapy typically includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., pyridostigmine) for symptomatic relief. Immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) is added for more generalized or refractory cases. Thymectomy is recommended in selected patients, particularly those with thymoma or early-onset generalized MG. During pregnancy and lactation, medications must be chosen carefully: pyridostigmine is generally considered safe, while corticosteroids may be used with vigilance. Other immunosuppressants require risk-benefit analysis given potential teratogenic effects. Option A (Female onset in the 3rd decade and male onset in the 6th\u20137th decades) correctly reflects the classic bimodal distribution of MG. Option B reverses these patterns and Option C incorrectly suggests an earlier onset in females. The marked answer, Option A, is therefore correct. \u2022 MG has a bimodal distribution: young women (typically 20\u201340 years) and older men (typically 60\u201380 years).  \u2022 Diagnosis is based on antibody testing, electrodiagnostic studies, and clinical findings.  \u2022 Management often requires a multidisciplinary approach, especially when thymectomy or long-term immunosuppression is considered. Recent guidelines emphasize individualized therapy based on patient age, MG subtype, and antibody status. Studies continue to evaluate the best immunosuppressive regimens and the role of early thymectomy in non-thymomatous MG. Special considerations in pregnancy and lactation have led to updated protocols ensuring safe maternal and fetal outcomes.",

    "explanation": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder where antibodies are directed against components of the neuromuscular junction, most commonly the postsynaptic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. This autoimmune attack leads to impaired neuromuscular transmission and fluctuating muscle weakness. In MG, IgG autoantibodies target the ACh receptor, binding to it and interfering with its normal function. These antibodies not only physically block the receptor from interacting with acetylcholine (hence 'blocking'), but also trigger complement-mediated damage and accelerate receptor internalization, reducing the effective number of receptors available for neuromuscular transmission. Among the mechanisms, the blocking of the receptor is a key feature in the majority of patients. Patients with MG typically present with fatigable and fluctuating weakness that worsens with activity. Extraocular muscles are often involved (resulting in ptosis and diplopia), and bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles may also be affected. The blockade of ACh receptors is directly responsible for these clinical manifestations. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and confirmatory tests. The edrophonium (Tensilon) test, detection of anti-ACh receptor antibodies via radioimmunoassay, and electrophysiologic studies (repetitive nerve stimulation and single-fiber EMG) are commonly used. Differential diagnoses include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, botulism, and other neuromuscular junction disorders. First-line management typically involves symptomatic treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., pyridostigmine). Immunosuppressive therapies (such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil) are added for patients with moderate to severe disease. Thymectomy is considered in selected patients, especially younger individuals with thymic hyperplasia. In pregnancy, pyridostigmine is generally safe, but caution is advised with immunosuppressants due to potential teratogenicity; multidisciplinary management is essential. Option A ('Acetylcholine binding') might misleadingly reference the fact that antibodies bind to the receptor but does not emphasize the functional blockade.

Uniquely, connexin32 is expressed in both the peripheral nervous system and within certain central nervous system (CNS) regions, explaining why some patients may experience transient CNS symptoms in addition to peripheral neuropathy. Patients with CMTX typically exhibit peripheral neuropathy signs such as distal muscle weakness, foot deformities (high arches or hammertoes), and sensory deficits. In some cases, transient CNS symptoms such as dysarthria, ataxia, or transient hemiparesis can occur, likely due to transient dysfunction in central white matter tracts. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical evaluation, nerve conduction studies revealing demyelinating features, and genetic testing to identify mutations in the GJB1 gene. Differential diagnoses include other forms of CMT (such as CMT1 and CMT2), which generally do not present with CNS manifestations, and other hereditary neuropathies. Management is primarily supportive, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and the use of orthotic devices to manage foot deformities. While there is no cure, genetic counseling and symptomatic treatment are essential. In pregnancy, supportive care remains the cornerstone; there are no specific contraindications, but multidisciplinary management is recommended. Option A (CMT1) and Option B (CMT2) represent the demyelinating and axonal forms of CMT, respectively, which generally affect only the peripheral nervous system and do not produce CNS symptoms. Option C (CMTX) is correct because the X-linked form can exhibit both peripheral neuropathy and transient central nervous system manifestations. Option D (Tangier disease) involves abnormal cholesterol metabolism and does not present with these neurologic features. 1) CMTX is the only form of CMT commonly associated with transient central nervous system symptoms. 2) Genetic testing is key in confirming the diagnosis in families with X-linked inheritance patterns. Advances in genetic testing have improved the accuracy of CMT subtype diagnoses. Recent studies focus on the molecular pathways involved in connexin32 dysfunction, which may open doors for targeted therapies in the future.",

    "explanation": "Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient required for DNA synthesis and myelin formation. Deficiency in vitamin B12 can lead to subacute combined degeneration, particularly affecting the posterior columns of the spinal cord. Post bariatric surgery patients are at risk for nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin B12 deficiency, due to altered gastrointestinal anatomy and absorption. The deficiency disrupts myelin synthesis in the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts, leading to demyelination and neurologic deficits. Clinically, patients present with sensory deficits such as decreased vibration and proprioception, leading to an unsteady gait (especially in the dark) and a positive Romberg test. These signs are classic for posterior column involvement secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency. Diagnosis involves measuring serum levels of vitamin B12 along with metabolites such as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. MRI of the spinal cord may reveal signal changes in the posterior columns. Differential diagnoses include vitamin E deficiency (which may also cause neuropathy but is less common post-bariatric surgery), vitamin B1 deficiency (Wernicke encephalopathy, typically with ocular/memory issues), and other neurological conditions affecting the dorsal columns. The first-line treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency is replacement therapy, typically via intramuscular injections in cases of significant deficiency, followed by maintenance dosing. Oral supplementation may be used in less severe cases. In pregnant and lactating women, vitamin B12 supplementation is safe and critical to prevent adverse neurological and developmental outcomes in the fetus and infant. Long-term monitoring of vitamin levels is advised. Option A (Vit B12) is correct because posterior column signs (loss of vibration, proprioception, positive Romberg) are classically due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Option B (Vit B1) is associated with Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, which presents with ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion rather than isolated posterior column deficits. Option C (Vit E) deficiency can cause neuropathy but is less commonly associated with this clinical picture in post-bariatric surgery patients. Option D (Vit D) does not cause the neurological findings described. 1) Subacute combined degeneration, a hallmark of vitamin B12 deficiency, primarily affects the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts. 2) Patients undergoing bariatric surgery require lifelong nutritional monitoring and supplementation. Recent guidelines underscore the importance of routine screening for micronutrient deficiencies, including vitamin B12, in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. There is a strong emphasis on early intervention to prevent irreversible neurological damage.",

    "explanation": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting both upper and lower motor neurons. The disease is characterized by muscle weakness, atrophy, and spasticity without sensory involvement. In ALS, degeneration of motor neurons results in denervation of muscles. The resulting changes in the muscle membrane lead to spontaneous electrical activity detectable on electromyography (EMG). Fibrillation potentials are a hallmark of denervation and reflect the instability of muscle fibers in the absence of normal neural input. Clinically, patients with ALS present with a mixture of upper motor neuron signs (such as spasticity and hyperreflexia) and lower motor neuron signs (such as muscle atrophy, fasciculations, and weakness). The presence of fibrillation potentials on EMG supports the diagnosis by indicating active denervation. The diagnosis of ALS is made based on clinical criteria (e.g., the revised El Escorial criteria) and is supported by EMG findings. EMG in ALS characteristically shows fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, and enlarged, polyphasic motor unit potentials due to chronic reinnervation. Differential diagnoses include multifocal motor neuropathy, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, and primary lateral sclerosis, all of which can be differentiated based on sensory involvement or neuroimaging findings. Management includes a multidisciplinary approach. Riluzole is considered first-line therapy to modestly slow disease progression, and edaravone may be used as a second-line option. Supportive care with physical therapy, nutritional support, and respiratory care is critical. In pregnancy, treatment options are limited due to teratogenic risks; a careful risk-benefit analysis is essential, and supportive management is prioritized. Lactation considerations also require a cautious approach regarding medication safety. Option A (Slow conduction velocity) is more indicative of demyelinating neuropathies rather than ALS. Option B (H reflex) is nonspecific and not characteristic of ALS. Option C (Fibrillation) is correct as it denotes spontaneous activity due to denervation, a key EMG finding in ALS. Option D is not provided. 1) ALS is unique in that it affects both upper and lower motor neurons while sparing sensory fibers. 2) EMG findings such as fibrillations and fasciculations are critical in supporting the diagnosis of ALS. Recent research and clinical guidelines continue to support the use of riluzole and edaravone as the main pharmacologic treatments for ALS. Ongoing studies are exploring gene-based therapies and novel neuroprotective strategies, although no cure exists at present.",

    "explanation": "This case describes a classic presentation of Guillain\u2010Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), specifically the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) variant. Typically, GBS follows an infectious illness such as a diarrheal episode (often associated with Campylobacter jejuni). The temporal relationship (symptoms starting about 1\u20133 weeks post-infection) is a key feature. Following an antecedent infection, molecular mimicry triggers an autoimmune response. In AIDP, antibodies mistakenly target peripheral nerve myelin leading to inflammation and demyelination. This immune-mediated process disrupts nerve conduction leading to weakness and paresthesia. Patients typically present with ascending weakness, areflexia, and sensory disturbances. The history of diarrhea followed by neurological symptoms supports the diagnosis. AIDP usually develops acutely over days to weeks, distinguishing it from chronic processes. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and neurological examination. Investigations include nerve conduction studies (showing slowed conduction velocity) and cerebrospinal fluid analysis (often demonstrating albuminocytological dissociation). Differential diagnoses include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), acute myelopathies, and metabolic neuropathies. First-line treatments include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasmapheresis, both of which have proven efficacy in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms. Supportive care, including monitoring of respiratory function, is critical. In pregnancy, IVIG and plasmapheresis are considered safe and are the preferred treatments over many immunomodulatory agents. Option A (AIDP) is correct. Option B (CIDP) is incorrect because CIDP is a chronic process with progression over months, whereas this patient\u2019s history is consistent with an acute condition. Options C and D are not provided. \u2022 Antecedent diarrheal illness (often due to Campylobacter) is a red flag for GBS. \u2022 The acute onset of ascending weakness with areflexia is typical for AIDP. \u2022 Early treatment with IVIG or plasmapheresis improves outcomes. Recent guidelines continue to endorse early treatment with IVIG or plasmapheresis for GBS.

    "explanation": "Anti-MuSK myasthenia gravis (MG) is a subset of MG characterized by autoantibodies to muscle-specific kinase. Unlike typical acetylcholine receptor (AChR) positive MG, MuSK-positive MG tends to involve different muscle groups. Antibodies targeting MuSK disrupt the normal clustering of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to impaired neuromuscular transmission. This predominantly affects bulbar muscles, which are critical for speech and swallowing. Patients with MuSK-positive MG often present with prominent bulbar weakness, including dysarthria, dysphagia, and facial involvement. Although ocular muscle involvement can occur, bulbar symptoms are more common and tend to be severe. Diagnosis is made by serological testing for anti-MuSK antibodies, in addition to clinical electrophysiological studies (repetitive nerve stimulation and single-fiber EMG). Differential diagnoses include AChR-positive MG (which more commonly presents with ocular symptoms) and other neuromuscular junction disorders. Treatment of MuSK-positive MG includes immunosuppressive therapies (such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, or rituximab) and symptomatic treatment. Pyridostigmine is less effective in MuSK-positive MG due to the presynaptic involvement. In pregnancy, corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) are generally considered safe if monitored carefully, and IVIG can be used during exacerbations. Lactating mothers should be counseled regarding medication safety, with prednisone and IVIG being relatively safe options. Option A (Bulbar) is correct because bulbar muscles are most commonly and severely affected in anti-MuSK MG. Option B (Distal muscle involvement) and Option C (Ocular) are less characteristic of MuSK-positive MG. \u2022 In anti-MuSK MG, bulbar weakness (dysphagia, dysarthria) is often the dominant feature. \u2022 Anti-MuSK MG may respond less favorably to cholinesterase inhibitors compared to AChR-positive MG.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "The case description is typical for a form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). LGMDs are a group of genetic disorders affecting primarily the proximal muscles with varying inheritance patterns. The absence of facial weakness and the presence of scapular winging are key features. LGMD2A (calpainopathy) results from mutations in the CAPN3 gene, which encodes the muscle-specific protease calpain-3. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to progressive muscle fiber degeneration and weakness, particularly affecting the proximal muscles. Patients with LGMD2A typically present in young adulthood with slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness. Bilateral scapular winging is a common manifestation, and the absence of significant facial weakness helps distinguish it from other muscular dystrophies such as facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical evaluation, elevated serum creatine kinase levels, muscle imaging, electromyography, and confirmatory genetic testing or muscle biopsy. Differential diagnoses include other LGMD types (e.g., LGMD2C), FSHD (which usually features facial weakness), and myopathies of other etiologies. There is currently no curative treatment for LGMD2A. Management is supportive and includes physical therapy, orthopedic support, and exercise regimens tailored to preserve muscle function. Cardiac and respiratory evaluations are important. Genetic counseling is recommended. For women during pregnancy and lactation, management remains supportive with attention to preserving mobility and minimizing stress on weakened muscles. Option A (LGMD2A) is correct given the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, age of onset, proximal weakness, and scapular winging without facial involvement. Option B (LGMD1B) is autosomal dominant and often has cardiac involvement. Option C (FSHD) typically presents with facial weakness, and Option D (LGMD2C) has a different clinical profile with usually earlier and sometimes more severe calf involvement. \u2022 LGMD2A (calpainopathy) is the most common autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. \u2022 Scapular winging with proximal limb weakness, in the absence of facial involvement, strongly suggests LGMD2A. Recent genetic studies have refined the diagnostic criteria for LGMD subtypes. While no disease-modifying therapies exist, ongoing trials are exploring gene therapy and other molecular approaches, although management remains primarily supportive.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction. It is characterized by autoantibodies directed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to impaired acetylcholine release. In LEMS, the autoantibodies reduce calcium influx into the nerve terminal, resulting in diminished release of acetylcholine. This leads to a characteristic decremental motor response on low-frequency stimulation and an incremental response with high-frequency stimulation or after exercise. Patients usually present with proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and sometimes improvement of strength after repeated use (facilitation phenomenon). LEMS can be paraneoplastic (commonly associated with small cell lung cancer) or idiopathic (autoimmune). Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, electrophysiological studies showing increased compound muscle action potentials after exercise or high-frequency stimulation, and confirmation with serological tests for anti\u2013P/Q-type calcium channel antibodies. Differential diagnoses include myasthenia gravis (which more commonly involves ocular muscles) and other neuromuscular junction disorders. First-line symptomatic treatment is with 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), which increases acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. Immunosuppressive therapy, most notably with corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone), is employed to attenuate the autoimmune response. Azathioprine is considered as a steroid-sparing agent but is generally second-line. In paraneoplastic cases, treating the underlying malignancy is critical. For pregnant and lactating patients, prednisolone is generally considered acceptable with precautions, and IVIG can be used if there is a clinical need while being mindful of its cost and accessibility. 3,4-DAP, while effective, has limited data in pregnancy, so risks and benefits must be carefully weighed. Option C (3-4 DAP + Prednisolone) is correct because it combines the symptomatic management with 3,4-DAP and the immunosuppressive benefits of prednisolone. Option A (Prednisolone + pyridostigmine) is less effective as pyridostigmine does not reliably address the presynaptic defect in LEMS. Option B (3-4 DAP + Azathioprine) is a potential regimen but azathioprine is usually reserved as a secondary, steroid-sparing agent and not the first choice over prednisolone. \u2022 The facilitation phenomenon (improved strength after repetitive activity) is a hallmark of LEMS. \u2022 3,4-DAP is the cornerstone of symptomatic therapy in LEMS. \u2022 Immunosuppressive therapy is vital, especially in non-paraneoplastic cases, to control the autoimmune process. Recent studies validate 3,4-DAP as the gold-standard symptomatic treatment in LEMS. Guidelines continue to support the use of corticosteroids as first-line immunosuppression, with azathioprine reserved for long-term management when steroid side effects are a concern. Ongoing research into targeted immunotherapies offers future promise.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Bell\u2019s palsy is an idiopathic peripheral facial nerve (CN VII) palsy that results in a loss of function of all the muscles of facial expression on the affected side. The key concept is to identify which muscles are innervated by the facial nerve as opposed to those controlled by other cranial nerves. The underlying mechanism involves inflammation and edema of the facial nerve, often near the stylomastoid foramen. This inflammation interrupts neural transmission, leading to paralysis of all muscles supplied by the facial nerve. The stylohyoid muscle, although less frequently discussed compared to muscles like the orbicularis oculi or oris, is innervated by the facial nerve and is thereby affected by Bell\u2019s palsy. Patients with Bell\u2019s palsy typically present with unilateral facial droop, inability to close the eye, drooping at the mouth, and sometimes altered taste sensation. Identifying that the stylohyoid is innervated by CN VII helps differentiate it from muscles like the temporalis and masseter (masticatory muscles via V3) and the levator palpebrae (innervated by CN III). The diagnosis of Bell\u2019s palsy is mainly clinical. Differential diagnoses include stroke (central facial palsy), Lyme disease, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and tumors compressing the facial nerve. Neuroimaging may be warranted if the presentation is atypical. Electrophysiological tests can sometimes be used to assess nerve function. Current guidelines recommend early initiation of corticosteroids (within 72 hours of symptom onset) as first-line therapy; antivirals may be considered in severe cases. Supportive care, including eye protection, is essential. In the context of pregnancy and lactation, corticosteroids can be used after evaluating the risk versus benefits, with close monitoring for maternal and fetal effects. Option A (stylohyoid) is correct because it is innervated by the facial nerve and hence involved in Bell\u2019s palsy. Options B (temporalis) and C (masseter) are incorrect as they are muscles of mastication innervated by the trigeminal nerve (V3). Option D (levator palpebrae) is incorrect as it is innervated by the oculomotor nerve (CN III) and is not involved in facial expression. \u2022 Bell\u2019s palsy typically presents as a sudden onset unilateral facial weakness. \u2022 Early corticosteroid treatment significantly improves functional recovery. \u2022 Eye protection is critical if the patient cannot fully close the eye. Recent studies continue to support the early use of corticosteroids, with adjunctive antiviral therapy being considered in cases with severe nerve involvement.

    "explanation": "Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathies (HMSN), commonly known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, are a group of inherited disorders affecting the peripheral nerves. The most common form, CMT1A, is due to a PMP22 duplication. When this duplication is absent, other genetic causes must be considered. CMT results from abnormalities affecting the myelin sheath or the axon of peripheral nerves. Mutations in genes such as PMP22 and MPZ lead to defective myelin formation and maintenance. In the absence of a PMP22 duplication, a mutation in the MPZ gene, which encodes myelin protein zero, is a well-recognized alternative cause, particularly in CMT1B. Clinically, patients present with slow progressive distal muscle weakness, typically in the lower extremities, resulting in foot deformities and high arches. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern further supports the possibility of a CMT subtype other than CMT1A, making it essential to expand the genetic evaluation to include genes like MPZ. Diagnosis involves a combination of family history evaluation, physical examination, nerve conduction studies, and genetic testing. Differential diagnoses include other inherited neuropathies and acquired demyelinating polyneuropathies (eg, diabetic neuropathy). The lack of PMP22 duplication directs clinicians to consider testing for MPZ mutations. There is no cure for CMT; management is supportive and focuses on physical therapy, orthopedic interventions (eg, braces), and pain management. Genetic counseling is recommended for affected families. In pregnancy and lactation, physical therapy and lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of management with careful monitoring of maternal function and comfort. Option A (repeat PMP22 test) is not indicated if initial testing is reliable. Option B (DGP1) is not a recognized gene commonly implicated in CMT. Option C (MPZ) is correct because mutations in the MPZ gene are a frequent alternative cause of CMT when PMP22 duplication is absent. Option D (PMP22 deletion) is associated with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), which has a distinct clinical presentation. \u2022 CMT is one of the most common inherited neuromuscular disorders. \u2022 PMP22 duplication is typical of CMT1A, but a negative test should prompt evaluation for other genes like MPZ. \u2022 Genetic counseling plays a vital role given the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Current research supports the use of comprehensive genetic panels for diagnosing CMT.

    "explanation": "Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is a paraneoplastic disorder often associated with small cell lung cancer, especially in older patients with a history of smoking. It is characterized by autoantibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, specifically of the P/Q type. LEMS involves the production of autoantibodies against the P/Q-type calcium channels at the neuromuscular junction, which impairs calcium influx necessary for the release of acetylcholine. This leads to diminished neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness, including bulbar and generalized weakness. Clinically, LEMS presents with proximal muscle weakness, sometimes affecting bulbar muscles, and may also feature autonomic dysfunction (eg, dry mouth). A significant smoking history raises suspicion for an underlying small cell lung cancer, a common association in paraneoplastic LEMS. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, electrophysiological studies (demonstrating incremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation), and serologic testing for P/Q-type calcium channel antibodies. Differential diagnoses include myasthenia gravis (typically anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibodies) and paraneoplastic syndromes associated with other antibodies (eg, anti-Hu and anti-Yo, which have different clinical syndromes). Management should focus on treating the underlying malignancy (if present) in addition to symptomatic therapy. First-line symptomatic treatments include 3,4-diaminopyridine, which helps increase acetylcholine release. Immunosuppressive therapies and intravenous immunoglobulin may be considered in refractory cases. In pregnancy and lactation, treatment requires a careful balance; while some immunotherapies may be used if benefits outweigh risks, supportive care and careful monitoring are critical. Option A (Anti Hu) is incorrect as anti-Hu antibodies are more commonly associated with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and sensory neuropathies.

    "explanation": "Periodic paralysis is a spectrum of genetic disorders characterized by episodic muscle weakness due to ion channel dysfunction. In hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, symptoms can be precipitated by high potassium ingestion, like foods such as tomatoes and bananas. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is typically caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle sodium channel gene (SCN4A). These mutations lead to abnormal sodium channel function resulting in sustained membrane depolarization after triggers such as high potassium intake, thereby precipitating muscle weakness episodes. Patients experience episodic muscle weakness or paralysis, often triggered by a potassium-rich meal. The association with foods like tomato and banana (which are high in potassium) helps differentiate this condition from other forms of periodic paralysis. Attacks are often brief and may be accompanied by muscle stiffness or myalgia. Diagnosis is based on a thorough clinical history, measurement of serum potassium levels during attacks, electromyography, and genetic testing. Differential diagnoses include hypokalemic periodic paralysis (often linked to calcium channel mutations) and paramyotonia congenita, which can present with cold-induced symptoms. Acute management includes measures to lower serum potassium levels using glucose and insulin to drive potassium into cells. Preventative strategies include avoiding known triggers such as potassium-rich foods. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (eg, acetazolamide) are considered for prophylaxis in some cases. For pregnant or lactating patients, dietary modifications and careful metabolic monitoring are essential, and drug choices must be weighed with respect to fetal safety. Option A (Na channel) is correct as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is caused by mutations in the sodium channel (SCN4A). Option B (Ca channel) is typically implicated in hypokalemic periodic paralysis \u2013 a different entity.
