    "explanation": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is diagnosed based on evidence of lesions separated in both time and space. The McDonald criteria require demonstration of dissemination in space (lesions in characteristic regions such as periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, or spinal cord) and dissemination in time (lesions developing at different points, which can be shown by simultaneous presence of enhancing and non-enhancing lesions on MRI). MS is an immune\u2010mediated demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. Inflammation causes focal demyelination and axonal injury in the white matter. An active inflammatory process in one lesion (often visible as contrast enhancement on MRI) alongside older, non-enhancing lesions demonstrates that the disease has occurred at different times, even if the spatial criteria may be borderline or not fully met by specific lesions. In the presented case, the MRI reveals both enhancing and non-enhancing lesions which is evidence of dissemination in time. However, the periventricular lesion count (only two lesions) does not meet the stricter MAGNIMS criteria for dissemination in space that sometimes require a higher number of periventricular lesions depending on the definition used. Clinicians rely on a combination of clinical history, neurological exam, and MRI findings. The differentials include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and small vessel ischemic changes. A careful review of lesion distribution, morphology, and additional CSF studies (such as oligoclonal bands) aid in confirming MS. Diagnosis confirmation guides treatment initiation. First-line management of MS (particularly RRMS) includes disease modifying therapies (DMT); however, the decision depends on definite evidence of MS. Acute attacks are usually managed with high-dose corticosteroids. Pregnancy and lactation require careful selection of DMTs \u2013 many are contraindicated or require a washout period. The updated guidelines emphasize early treatment for confirmed MS, while in a diagnostic uncertainty scenario, further follow-up and tests are recommended. Option A (Both dissemination in space and time) is incorrect because, despite evidence of dissemination in time from mixed lesion enhancement, the spatial criterion is not fully met due to the periventricular lesion number being below threshold per MAGNIMS criteria. Option B (Only dissemination in space) is incorrect since there is clear evidence of lesions from different time points. Option C (Only dissemination in time) is correct as the current imaging demonstrates enhancing and non-enhancing lesions, addressing dissemination in time even though spatial criteria are borderline. \u2022 The presence of both enhancing and non-enhancing lesions on MRI in a patient with symptoms of MS is strong evidence for dissemination in time.  \u2022 When applying MAGNIMS criteria, the number and location of lesions (such as periventricular lesions) are critical; a low lesion count may fail to satisfy the spatial criterion. Recent updates to the McDonald criteria (most notably the 2017 revision) have refined the imaging requirements for MS diagnosis. Although modifications allow for earlier diagnosis, strict application of spatial criteria (as defined by different sets of guidelines like MAGNIMS) remains important to avoid overdiagnosis.",

    "question": "Case scenario of a patient with MS, on natalizumab, attached to an MRI brain & spine, what to do?",
    "option_a": "ACE level",
    "option_b": "JC virus PCR",
    "option_c": "anti jcv ab",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Natalizumab is a high\u2010efficacy disease-modifying therapy used in MS that works by inhibiting leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. However, its use is associated with an increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a severe demyelinating condition caused by the JC virus. PML is caused by the reactivation of the JC virus in immunocompromised states. Natalizumab impairs immune surveillance in the CNS, allowing latent JC virus to reactivate, which can lead to widespread demyelination. Determining the JC virus status is therefore critical before and during therapy. In patients on natalizumab, a positive JC virus antibody index is associated with increased risk for PML. Clinically, PML may present with a variety of neurological deficits that mimic or overlap with MS symptoms, making surveillance essential. Clinicians routinely test for anti-JC virus antibodies in the serum to stratify risk. Although JC virus PCR on CSF is used when PML is suspected clinically, routine monitoring is done via serological testing. Differential diagnoses include central nervous system lymphoma or new MS activity, which have different imaging and laboratory profiles. Current guidelines recommend regular monitoring of anti-JC virus antibody status in patients receiving natalizumab. In pregnancies, natalizumab use is generally avoided or discontinued because of potential fetal risks and uncertainties regarding long-term safety. If PML is suspected clinically and on MRI, prompt CSF analysis and JC virus PCR may be indicated, but for routine surveillance, anti-JCV antibody titers are the standard of care. Option A (ACE level) is inappropriate as it is used for conditions such as sarcoidosis, not for JC virus monitoring. Option B (JC virus PCR) is used in the diagnostic workup when PML is suspected (typically via CSF analysis), not for routine risk stratification. Option C (anti-JCV ab) is correct because serological testing for anti-JC virus antibodies is the standard method for risk assessment in natalizumab-treated patients. \u2022 Regular anti-JCV antibody testing is essential in patients on natalizumab to assess PML risk.  \u2022 JC virus PCR is reserved for diagnostic evaluation when PML is suspected clinically, rather than for routine surveillance. Recent studies continue to refine risk stratification in natalizumab-treated patients, emphasizing the importance of anti-JCV antibody index levels. The current guidelines from MS societies support periodic anti-JCV antibody testing to guide treatment decisions.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) have varying safety profiles in women of childbearing potential. Some DMTs are teratogenic or have uncertain safety profiles in pregnancy, necessitating a washout period prior to conception. Fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, sequesters lymphocytes in lymph nodes thereby reducing their migration into the CNS. However, it has been associated with teratogenic effects in animal studies, leading to caution when used in women wishing to conceive. In clinical practice, women with RRMS who wish to become pregnant are advised to discontinue medications with known teratogenic risks and follow appropriate washout protocols. Fingolimod, in particular, requires discontinuation typically around 2 months before conception to minimize fetal exposure. While this question does not involve diagnostic imaging or laboratory evaluation, the history of DMT use and pregnancy planning requires careful review of medication half-life, teratogenic risks, and recommended washout periods. Differential considerations would include other DMTs such as teriflunomide, which actually requires an even longer washout period or accelerated elimination procedure. For women planning pregnancy, guidelines recommend discontinuing teratogenic DMTs. First-line recommendations include switching to therapies with better pregnancy safety profiles (or stopping therapy with careful monitoring). Specific pregnancy and lactation considerations include counseling about the risks of fetal exposure, ensuring a proper washout period, and planning for monitoring during the preconception period. Fingolimod is advised to be stopped at least 2 months prior to conception. Option A (Fingolimod) is correct. It is likely the DMT the patient was on if she is stopping therapy for 2 months prior to conception, consistent with the required washout period due to its teratogenic potential. Other options are not provided but could have included therapies with different washout requirements or pregnancy safety profiles. \u2022 Fingolimod is contraindicated in pregnancy and requires a washout period of about 2 months before conception.  \u2022 It is important to individualize DMT plans for women of childbearing age to balance disease control and fetal safety. Recent guidelines emphasize the need for early family planning discussions in MS management and have clarified the pregnancy categories and washout periods for various DMTs, with fingolimod being a prime example of a medication that should be discontinued well before conception.",

    "question": "Young lady came with typical acute right optic neuritis + no previous attacks. VA was 20/60 on right side with RAPD. Brain MRI reported one PV lesion and one cerebellar lesion, both of them typical for MS lesions (they wrote like this in report). There was no enhancing lesions. What to do next?",
    "option_a": "Start fingolimod",
    "option_b": "Interferon",
    "option_c": "Observe while doing more confirmatory test",
    "option_d": "Annual MRI flu",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Optic neuritis is a common presenting syndrome in MS. The McDonald criteria require evidence of dissemination in space and time for a diagnosis of MS. In isolated attacks, additional evidence (via imaging or CSF studies) is needed to confirm MS. Optic neuritis is caused by inflammatory demyelination of the optic nerve. In MS, similar inflammatory processes are seen in other CNS regions. The presence of lesions in different CNS locations supports dissemination in space, while the time-related evolution of lesions (enhancing, non-enhancing) supports dissemination in time. The patient presents with typical features of acute optic neuritis (unilateral vision loss, relative afferent pupillary defect) and has MRI findings with one periventricular and one cerebellar lesion. Although these lesions are typical for MS, the absence of enhancing lesions indicates that there is no radiologic evidence of dissemination in time, which is required for a definitive MS diagnosis. In such scenarios, a comprehensive evaluation including CSF analysis for oligoclonal bands, visual evoked potentials, and repeat imaging after a period of time is warranted. Differential diagnoses include isolated optic neuritis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, and other inflammatory or demyelinating conditions. A follow\u2010up MRI is often performed to assess for new lesions that would fulfill dissemination in time. Management of acute optic neuritis typically involves high-dose corticosteroids to speed up recovery, although they do not affect long-term outcomes. When the diagnosis of MS is not yet established due to lack of dissemination in time, immediate initiation of DMT is generally deferred. Instead, further confirmatory testing (repeat MRI, CSF studies) should be pursued. In pregnancy and lactation, care must be taken in selecting DMTs because many have contraindications or require washout; however, the initial management of the acute attack remains similar irrespective of pregnancy status. Option A (Start fingolimod) is premature because the diagnosis of MS is not firmly established. Option B (Interferon) is also a DMT used in confirmed MS and would be considered only after a definite diagnosis. Option C (Observe while doing more confirmatory test) is the most appropriate approach in a CIS where dissemination in time has not been demonstrated. Option D (Annual MRI flu) is vague and does not address the need for a diagnostic confirmation. \u2022 In a patient with a first episode of optic neuritis and MRI lesions in different regions, confirmatory tests (repeat MRI or CSF studies) are essential to establish the diagnosis of MS.  \u2022 Early treatment of CIS with DMT can delay progression to definite MS, but initiation of therapy requires a definitive diagnosis based on established criteria. Recent revisions of the McDonald criteria incorporate the use of CSF oligoclonal bands and refined MRI criteria for diagnosing MS. While early initiation of DMT in high-risk CIS is supported by evidence, a definite diagnosis must first be established to avoid unnecessary long-term treatment.",

    "question": "Young lady came with persistent nausea and vomiting, all the GIT workup was unremarkable. Brain MRI was done and attached. Based on the suspected diagnosis, which criteria is core?",
    "option_a": "optic neuritis",
    "option_b": "cerebellitis",
    "option_c": "diencephalitis/narcolepsy",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "This case describes a young woman with persistent vomiting despite an unremarkable gastrointestinal workup, prompting evaluation of central causes. In neurology, an intractable vomiting syndrome without GI pathology strongly suggests an involvement of the area postrema \u2013 a circumventricular organ in the medulla \u2013 which is one of the core clinical characteristics in the diagnostic criteria of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). NMOSD is an autoimmune astrocytopathy mediated by anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies. The area postrema, lacking a robust blood-brain barrier, is vulnerable to immune-mediated injury caused by these antibodies. Inflammation here manifests as nausea, vomiting, and hiccups \u2013 collectively known as the area postrema syndrome. Recent evidence has reinforced the role of complement-mediated damage in this process, further supporting its inclusion as a core clinical criterion. The clinical picture of persistent nausea and vomiting with a negative GI workup, particularly in a young woman, should raise suspicion for a central cause such as NMOSD. The presence of area postrema syndrome correlates with MRI findings (often T2 hyperintensities in the dorsal medulla) and positive AQP4 antibody serology. Diagnosis involves a combination of neuroimaging (MRI showing lesions in the area postrema or dorsal medulla), serologic testing for AQP4-IgG antibodies, and clinical criteria as outlined by the 2015 International Panel for NMOSD Diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include gastrointestinal disorders (ruled out by workup), brainstem encephalitis, and other demyelinating disorders like multiple sclerosis (which typically have distinct lesion patterns). First-line treatment usually involves high-dose intravenous corticosteroids for acute attacks, followed by plasma exchange if there is an inadequate response. Long-term immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil) is recommended to prevent relapses. In pregnancy or lactation, corticosteroids (with appropriate monitoring) and certain immunosuppressants that are considered safer (e.g., azathioprine) may be used, balancing disease control with fetal safety as per current guidelines. Option A (optic neuritis) is indeed seen in NMOSD but is not the core feature in this clinical scenario. Option B (cerebellitis) does not typically present with isolated vomiting. Option C (diencephalitis/narcolepsy) describes a different pattern of brain involvement. Option D, which is intended to represent area postrema syndrome, is the correct core criterion given the patient\u2019s presentation. 1. Intractable nausea and vomiting with a negative GI workup in a young woman warrants evaluation for central causes such as NMOSD. 2. Area postrema syndrome is a core clinical criterion in the 2015 NMOSD diagnostic criteria. 3. AQP4-IgG antibody testing is critical for confirming the diagnosis. Recent guidelines and studies emphasize early recognition of area postrema syndrome in NMOSD. The 2015 revisions of the diagnostic criteria have improved early diagnosis, and current research continues to support complement inhibition and targeted immunotherapy as promising treatment strategies.",

Her CSF was conclusive for HSV1, she received antiviral therapy, after few days she come back with seizure and orofacial dyskinesia. The team suspected autoimmune encephalitis. What is the most common paraneoplastic antibody to look for?",

    "option_d": "mGLUR5",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "This question presents a young female who initially had HSV-1 encephalitis. After antiviral treatment, she develops seizures and orofacial dyskinesia. Such a clinical course is characteristic of secondary autoimmune encephalitis, particularly anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, which is known to follow HSV encephalitis. After HSV encephalitis, an autoimmune cascade can be triggered via molecular mimicry. In this process, the immune system generates antibodies against the NMDA receptor (usually the NR1 subunit), leading to receptor hypofunction. This autoimmune response results in neuropsychiatric symptoms, movement disorders (notably orofacial dyskinesia), and seizures. The patient\u2019s progression from infectious encephalitis (confirmed by CSF HSV-1) to neuropsychiatric manifestations and seizures is typical for post-herpes simplex virus autoimmune encephalitis. Orofacial dyskinesia is a hallmark sign of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, especially in young women. Diagnosis is made by detecting anti-NMDA receptor antibodies in serum and CSF. Prior history of HSV encephalitis supports this diagnosis. Differential considerations include residual infectious encephalitis, other autoimmune encephalitides (such as limbic encephalitis associated with anti-Hu antibodies), and metabolic encephalopathies. EEG, MRI, and antibody panels help differentiate these disorders. First-line management involves immunotherapy with high-dose corticosteroids combined with IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis. Tumor screening (especially for ovarian teratoma) is crucial. In cases of pregnancy and lactation, corticosteroids and IVIG are generally preferred due to their safety profiles, whereas plasmapheresis may be reserved for refractory cases after careful risk-benefit assessment. Option A (NMDA antibodies) is correct and directly linked to the typical post-HSV encephalitis autoimmune process. Option B (Yo antibodies) is associated with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, not this syndrome. Option C (anti Hu) is more characteristic of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, and option D (mGLUR5) is linked with other rare autoimmune conditions; hence, they are incorrect in this context. 1. New-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms following HSV encephalitis should raise suspicion for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. 2. Orofacial dyskinesia is a key clinical indicator in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. 3. Early immunotherapy is crucial for improving outcomes. Recent research continues to validate the link between HSV encephalitis and subsequent anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. The detection of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies in the CSF is now regarded as the gold standard, and evolving guidelines emphasize early immunomodulatory treatment and thorough tumor screening.",

    "option_c": "anti Hu",
    "option_d": "Anti Ri",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "This patient, with a history of breast cancer, presents with focal myoclonic jerks and abnormal, non\u2010rhythmic eye movements. These clinical features are consistent with paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, a well-recognized paraneoplastic syndrome associated with breast cancer. Paraneoplastic syndromes occur when immune responses cross-react between tumor antigens and neural antigens. In opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, anti-Ri (ANNA-2) antibodies target neuronal proteins involved in eye movement control and motor coordination, leading to cortical myoclonus and chaotic ocular movements. Patients with paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus present with rapid, unpredictable eye movements (sometimes termed opsoclonus) and myoclonic jerks. The association with breast cancer is well-documented and should prompt evaluation for anti-Ri antibodies. Diagnosis is achieved by clinical recognition of the syndrome combined with antibody testing (serum and/or CSF for anti-Ri antibodies). Differential diagnoses include metastatic brain lesions, metabolic encephalopathies causing myoclonus, and drug-induced movement disorders. Neuroimaging and antibody panels help differentiate these conditions. The cornerstone of management is treatment of the underlying malignancy along with immunotherapy (high-dose corticosteroids, IVIG, or plasmapheresis) to mitigate the autoimmune process. In cases involving pregnant or lactating women, immune therapies with a safer profile (such as corticosteroids and IVIG) may be considered after careful risk assessment, while delaying aggressive interventions if necessary. Option A (NMDA antibodies) is primarily associated with encephalitis and neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than focal myoclonus. Option B (Yo antibodies) are linked with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Option C (anti Hu) is typically seen in paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. Option D (Anti Ri) is the correct choice given its strong association with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome in breast cancer patients. 1. Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome in adults should prompt evaluation for underlying malignancies, particularly breast cancer. 2. Anti-Ri antibodies are the hallmark for this paraneoplastic syndrome. 3. Early treatment of both the tumor and the immune response can improve neurological outcomes. Recent studies have emphasized the role of anti-Ri antibodies in the pathogenesis of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. Current guidelines recommend a combined oncologic and immunotherapeutic approach, with emerging data supporting early intervention to minimize long-term neurological sequelae.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) that works by inhibiting leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. A significant adverse effect of natalizumab is the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease caused by reactivation of JC virus (JCV). PML results from reactivation of latent JC virus in the central nervous system in the setting of diminished immune surveillance. Natalizumab\u2019s mechanism of action impairs immune cell trafficking to the brain, thereby increasing the risk of JC virus reactivation and subsequent demyelination. Patients on natalizumab are at risk of developing PML, which presents with a gradual onset of neurologic deficits such as motor weakness, visual disturbances, cognitive changes, and coordination problems. Identifying patients at higher risk for JC virus exposure is crucial in clinical practice. Prior to initiating natalizumab, patients should be screened for JC virus antibodies using a pretreatment JC virus titre (or index) test. This screening helps stratify risk. Differential strategies include regular MRI surveillance, but serologic screening remains the cornerstone of prevention. Differential diagnoses for similar neurologic deficits include MS relapses and other opportunistic infections, which can often be distinguished by imaging and laboratory tests. Before starting natalizumab, a pretreatment JC virus antibody titre screening is recommended to assess risk. For patients at high risk (i.e., seropositive with a high antibody index), alternative therapies or closer monitoring may be considered. First-line prevention is rigorous screening and risk stratification. In patients who are pregnant or lactating, natalizumab may be used cautiously if the benefits outweigh the risks, but JCV screening remains essential to minimize PML risk. Option A (Annual MRI) is used for monitoring but does not prevent PML. Option B (Pretreatment JC virus titre screen) is the correct choice as it stratifies risk prior to therapy initiation. Options C and D are not provided, making option B the best available strategy to prevent PML in this context. 1. JC virus antibody screening is mandatory before initiating natalizumab. 2. A high JC virus antibody index indicates increased risk for PML. 3. Although annual MRI monitoring is important, it does not replace the need for pretreatment serologic screening. Current guidelines and recent research emphasize that pretreatment JC virus antibody screening is the most effective strategy to mitigate the risk of PML in patients receiving natalizumab. Ongoing studies continue to refine risk stratification based on antibody index values and duration of therapy.",

    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as Fingolimod aim to reduce relapse rates and disability progression by modulating the immune system. Fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. It binds to S1P receptors on lymphocytes, sequestering them in lymph nodes and preventing their migration to the CNS. An unintended consequence is that it can also affect vascular permeability in the retina, predisposing patients to macular edema\u2014a known complication especially in individuals with pre-existing risk factors like diabetes. In this case, the patient developed bilateral blurred vision soon after starting Fingolimod. Since the neurological exam and brain MRI remain stable, the visual symptoms point toward an adverse drug effect (i.e., macular edema) rather than an MS relapse such as optic neuritis. When a patient on Fingolimod presents with visual changes, an ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the investigation of choice to detect macular edema. Differential diagnoses include optic neuritis (usually associated with pain and MRI changes), diabetic retinopathy, and other retinal pathologies. Upon confirmation of macular edema, guidelines recommend discontinuation or dose adjustment of Fingolimod. Patients should have baseline and periodic ophthalmologic evaluations. In women of childbearing potential or those who are pregnant/lactating, Fingolimod is contraindicated due to its teratogenic effects, and switching to a pregnancy\u2010compatible DMT is advised with appropriate washout periods and close monitoring. Option A (Fingolimod) is correct as it is the only DMT in the list known to cause macular edema. Option B (Teriflunomide) is typically linked to hepatic issues and peripheral neuropathy. Option C (Interferon) is associated with flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions, and Option D (Natalizumab) carries risks like progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) without a known link to macular edema. 1. Fingolimod\u2019s most notable ocular side effect is macular edema, particularly in patients with diabetes. 2. Normal MRI and exam in the context of visual symptoms should prompt evaluation for drug\u2010related toxicity rather than MS relapse. 3. A baseline and periodic eye exam is essential for patients on Fingolimod. Recent studies and updated guidelines emphasize the importance of routine ophthalmologic monitoring in patients taking Fingolimod, as well as the need for careful risk assessment in patients with diabetes or other predisposing factors to macular edema.",

    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that has long been implicated in various autoimmune conditions, including multiple sclerosis. Epidemiologic studies consistently show a strong association between prior EBV infection and an increased risk of developing MS. The leading hypothesis involves molecular mimicry, where an immune response to EBV may cross-react with myelin antigens, triggering an autoimmune response. Almost all patients with MS are seropositive for EBV, reinforcing its potential role in the disease\u2019s pathogenesis. A history of infectious mononucleosis, which is typically caused by EBV, has been recognized as a risk factor for MS. Although EBV does not directly cause MS, its presence is nearly universal among MS patients, suggesting that it triggers or amplifies the autoimmune process. Diagnosing MS is based on clinical presentation along with radiologic and laboratory findings. EBV serology is not used to diagnose MS but can support epidemiological associations. Differential considerations include other viral infections that may trigger similar immune responses, though none have as strong an association with MS as EBV. There is no antiviral treatment for EBV specifically in the context of MS management. Current research is investigating EBV vaccines and targeted therapies, however, none are approved for clinical use. In pregnancy and lactation, management of MS is guided by approved DMTs and symptomatic treatments, while viral exposure and seropositivity do not alter management strategies. Option A (EBV) is correct given its strong epidemiologic association with MS. Option B (CMV), Option C (HIV), and Option D (HHV6) have not demonstrated the same level of association with MS in the literature. 1. Nearly 100% of MS patients are seropositive for EBV, suggesting a potential trigger role. 2. A history of infectious mononucleosis increases the risk of developing MS. 3. Current research is focused on potential EBV vaccines to reduce MS incidence. Recent high-impact studies, including longitudinal cohort studies, have reinforced the strong link between EBV and MS. Ongoing research aims to clarify the immunological mechanisms behind this association and explore preventive strategies such as vaccination.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Rebound disease activity after discontinuation of a DMT is a recognized phenomenon in MS management. Fingolimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, is well known for its potential to cause a rebound effect if the drug is abruptly stopped. Fingolimod sequesters lymphocytes in lymph nodes, thereby reducing their CNS entry. When its effect is withdrawn, there can be a rapid release of sequestered lymphocytes back into circulation. This reconstitution can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response in the CNS, appearing as new, enhancing lesions on MRI, a phenomenon known as rebound relapse. In the presented scenario, the patient discontinued her DMT to pursue pregnancy. The subsequent appearance of new active enhancing brain lesions on MRI is highly suggestive of a rebound phenomenon rather than a gradual loss of disease control. This pattern fits the profile seen with fingolimod discontinuation. Diagnostic evaluation involves comparing serial MRI scans to identify new or enhancing lesions and correlating these radiologic findings with clinical history. Differential diagnoses include natural MS relapse, rebound relapse from other DMT discontinuations, or issues with MRI technique. However, the timing following drug withdrawal strongly suggests rebound. Guidelines recommend careful planning for pregnancy in MS patients on Fingolimod due to its rebound risk and teratogenic profile. A recommended approach is either switching to a safer medication with a better pregnancy risk profile or instituting a proper washout period with close clinical and radiological monitoring after discontinuation. During pregnancy and lactation, alternatives with established safety data should be considered. Option A (Sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor modulator) is correct since Fingolimod belongs to this category and is known to cause rebound relapses after discontinuation. Option B (CD52) refers to alemtuzumab, Option C (CS inhibitor) is not an established mechanism for MS DMTs, and Option D (B cell depletor) refers to agents like ocrelizumab, none of which are typically linked to a rebound phenomenon of this nature. 1. Abrupt discontinuation of Fingolimod can lead to a rebound MS relapse characterized by new enhancing lesions on MRI. 2. Pregnancy planning in women on Fingolimod demands careful transition strategies to avoid rebound activity. 3. A proper washout period and alternative therapy selection are critical in minimizing relapse risk. Recent clinical studies and guidelines stress the importance of gradual transition and careful monitoring when discontinuing Fingolimod, particularly in women planning pregnancy. Emerging data also support the potential use of bridging therapies to mitigate rebound relapse risks.",

    "question": "Newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis patient, started recently on one of DMT. Presented now with bilateral hands numbness. Exam and brain MRI are stable compared with the previous documentation. What DMT is likely responsible for such paraesthesia?",
    "option_a": "Fingolimod",
    "option_b": "Teriflunomide",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "DMTs for MS have distinct adverse effect profiles. In this scenario, the appearance of bilateral hand numbness in a patient with stable neurological exam and MRI suggests a side effect rather than a new MS lesion. Teriflunomide is one such DMT known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. Teriflunomide inhibits de novo pyrimidine synthesis by reversibly blocking dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. While its immunomodulatory effects are beneficial in MS, it can disrupt normal cellular functions in peripheral nerves, leading to neuropathic symptoms such as paraesthesia. The patient\u2019s complaint of bilateral hand numbness, in the setting of stable CNS imaging and exam, is more consistent with a drug-induced adverse effect (i.e., peripheral neuropathy) rather than an MS relapse. This is a recognized, albeit less common, side effect of Teriflunomide therapy. Evaluation should include a detailed history, neurological examination focused on peripheral nerve function, and possibly nerve conduction studies if the diagnosis is uncertain. Differential diagnoses include MS-related sensory symptoms, compressive neuropathies, or diabetic neuropathy given comorbid conditions. However, the temporal association with starting the DMT raises suspicion for a drug-related cause. Management involves close monitoring of neurological symptoms and considering dose adjustment or switching DMTs if peripheral neuropathy progresses. In women planning pregnancy or those who are pregnant/lactating, teriflunomide is contraindicated due to its significant teratogenic potential. Accelerated elimination procedures (using cholestyramine or activated charcoal) may be required if discontinuation is necessary. Option B (Teriflunomide) is correct because it is known to cause peripheral neuropathy, presenting as paraesthesia in the hands. Option A (Fingolimod) is more associated with macular edema, Option C (Interferon) typically causes flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions, and Option D (Natalizumab) is linked to risks of PML rather than peripheral neuropathy. 1. Teriflunomide's side effect profile includes peripheral neuropathy, which can manifest as hand numbness. 2. Stable CNS imaging amidst new sensory symptoms in an MS patient should prompt evaluation for drug toxicity. 3. Due to its teratogenic risk, teriflunomide requires careful consideration in women of childbearing potential. Recent updates in prescribing information and post-marketing surveillance have highlighted peripheral neuropathy as a notable adverse event associated with Teriflunomide. Guidelines now stress the need for baseline and periodic monitoring of nerve function, especially in patients with preexisting risk factors or those planning pregnancy.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammatory lesions that preferentially develop around small veins. The perivenular distribution is a hallmark of MS pathology. In MS, autoreactive immune cells pass through the blood\u2013brain barrier and initiate an inflammatory cascade around small venules. This perivenular inflammation results in demyelination and axonal injury, which later manifests as the typical plaques seen on MRI. The venous involvement explains the classic 'Dawson finger' appearance of lesions. The perivenular distribution correlates with clinical symptoms such as visual impairment, sensory disturbances, and motor deficits. An MRI often reveals lesions that cluster around the small veins, underscoring the role of venules in MS pathogenesis. Diagnosis of MS involves clinical evaluation, MRI (to demonstrate lesions disseminated in time and space), and sometimes CSF analysis for oligoclonal bands. Differential diagnoses include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and small vessel ischemic changes. Recognition of the lesion distribution helps distinguish MS from these other conditions. Management involves acute relapse treatment (typically high-dose corticosteroids) and maintenance therapy with disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) such as interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, and newer agents. In pregnant or lactating patients, selecting DMTs with proven safety profiles (like interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate) is crucial, while many newer agents are contraindicated or used with caution. Option A (Arterioles) is incorrect because MS lesions are not centered around arterioles. Option B (Venules) is correct since the inflammatory demyelination in MS typically occurs around small venules. Option C (Watershed zone) is incorrect because watershed zones, which are prone to hypoperfusion, are not a feature of MS pathology. 1. Dawson fingers on MRI signify perivenular demyelination in MS. 2. Lesions initiating around venules are key to identifying MS. 3. MS diagnosis relies on demonstrating dissemination in time and space through imaging and CSF analysis. Recent research emphasizes the perivenular inflammation model in MS, with advanced imaging techniques further validating the central role of venules. This has refined our understanding of MS lesion formation and supports therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory pathways.",

    "question": "Patient with RRMS on DMT presented with fatigability and easy bruises. He has no new relapse. Attached a picture of his skin during physical examination. Which DMT would cause this side effect?",

    "option_c": "Natalizumab",
    "option_d": "Dimethyl fumarate",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) modulate the immune system to reduce relapse rates and delay progression. Each DMT has a specific safety profile that may lead to distinct adverse effects. Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, present on mature lymphocytes. Its mechanism involves profound lymphocyte depletion followed by immune reconstitution. This immune reset can trigger secondary autoimmune phenomena, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), which manifests as bruising and fatigue due to low platelet counts. Patients on alemtuzumab require monitoring for autoimmune complications. Easy bruising is a clinical sign of thrombocytopenia, and fatigue may relate to systemic effects of decreased platelets or concurrent autoimmune processes. The absence of new neurological relapses focuses attention on medication-related adverse effects rather than MS disease activity. A thorough workup includes routine complete blood counts (CBC) to monitor for cytopenias. Differential diagnoses include bone marrow suppression from other DMTs, viral-induced thrombocytopenia, or primary hematologic disorders. Timely detection through regular monitoring is key to managing side effects. Management requires discontinuation of alemtuzumab if severe autoimmune thrombocytopenia occurs. Initial treatment involves corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for ITP. In pregnancy, alemtuzumab is generally avoided due to potential teratogenic effects and immune dysregulation in the fetus; lactating patients are also advised against its use. Option A (Alemtuzumab) is correct because it is known for causing secondary autoimmune complications like ITP, presenting with bruising and fatigue. Option B (Cladribine) largely causes lymphopenia with less propensity for autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Option C (Natalizumab) is primarily associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) rather than bleeding issues. Option D (Dimethyl fumarate) typically causes flushing and gastrointestinal distress rather than hematological side effects. 1. Alemtuzumab is uniquely associated with autoimmune complications, including ITP. 2. Regular CBC monitoring is essential for patients receiving alemtuzumab. 3. Bruising in a patient on DMTs should prompt evaluation for thrombocytopenia. Updated guidelines and post-marketing surveillance studies consistently report autoimmune thrombocytopenia as a significant adverse effect of alemtuzumab. This has reinforced the importance of routine blood monitoring and careful patient selection, especially in women of childbearing age.",

    "option_d": "Lymphoma panel",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Optic neuritis, characterized by painful vision loss, is a common clinical presentation in demyelinating disorders. Differentiating between multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is critical, as management and prognosis differ substantially. NMOSD is primarily an antibody-mediated astrocytopathy driven by AQP4-IgG, which targets aquaporin-4 water channels, leading to severe demyelination predominantly of the optic nerves and spinal cord. This contrasts with MS, where the immune attack is more diffusely directed against myelin. In a young female with optic neuritis, a normal brain MRI coupled with spinal MRI findings should raise suspicion for NMOSD. The severity or bilateral nature of visual impairment, along with the absence of typical MS brain lesions, supports this diagnosis. The diagnostic workup involves MRI of the brain and spinal cord, and serological testing for aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies. Differential diagnoses include MS (often with brain lesions and positive oligoclonal bands) and MOG-antibody associated disease. Testing for AQP4-IgG is highly specific for NMOSD. Acute NMOSD attacks are managed with high-dose corticosteroids, often with plasma exchange if response is inadequate. Long-term immunosuppression (using agents such as rituximab or azathioprine) is recommended to reduce relapse risk. For pregnant or lactating patients, azathioprine is preferred due to its established safety profile. Option A (OCB) points toward MS and is less useful in this scenario. Option B (Aquaporin 4 antibody) is correct because a positive AQP4-IgG test confirms NMOSD. Option C (ANCA and dsDNA) are markers of vasculitis and lupus, which are not suggested by the clinical picture. Option D (Lymphoma panel) is irrelevant to the demyelinating process under consideration. 1. NMOSD should be suspected in optic neuritis with normal brain MRI but abnormal spinal MRI findings. 2. AQP4 antibody testing is key for differentiating NMOSD from MS. 3. Early identification and treatment of NMOSD are critical to prevent severe disability. Recent consensus guidelines advocate early AQP4-IgG testing in cases of atypical optic neuritis to facilitate prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, which significantly improves long-term outcomes.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "The 2017 McDonald Criteria for diagnosing MS require demonstrating dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time (DIT). DIS refers to lesions in different characteristic areas of the CNS, while DIT reflects the occurrence of lesions at different time points (or their evidence by contrast enhancement patterns or CSF oligoclonal bands). MS is an inflammatory disease with lesions that vary in age; gadolinium-enhancing lesions indicate acute inflammation, whereas non-enhancing lesions represent older, inactive plaques. The coexistence of such lesions on a single MRI scan can satisfy the DIT criteria. In this case, a young female presenting with unilateral optic neuritis has a brain MRI showing one enhancing lesion and one non-enhancing brainstem lesion. The presence of both types of lesions confirms DIT, while different anatomical locations (optic nerve involvement and brainstem) meet DIS (with the additional support of positive oligoclonal bands if needed). Application of the 2017 McDonald Criteria involves correlating clinical findings with MRI features. Differential diagnoses include isolated optic neuritis, NMOSD, and MOG-antibody disease. However, the combination of enhancing/non-enhancing lesions along with oligoclonal bands is highly suggestive of MS. Early initiation of treatment is critical. Acute relapses are treated with high-dose corticosteroids, and long-term management often includes first-line DMTs such as interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate. In pregnancy, agents like interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate are preferred, while many newer agents require caution due to possible teratogenic effects. Option A (DIT but not DIS) is incorrect because the presence of lesions in different CNS regions meets the DIS requirement. Option B (DIS but not DIT) is incorrect given the coexistence of enhancing and non-enhancing lesions (or the presence of CSF oligoclonal bands) which fulfills DIT criteria. Option C (DIS and DIT) is correct as both criteria are met in this scenario. Option D is invalid as it provides no content. 1. A single MRI demonstrating both gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions can satisfy DIT. 2. Oligoclonal bands may serve as a surrogate for DIT in the correct clinical context. 3. The McDonald Criteria allow for early diagnosis of MS, which is essential for prompt treatment. Recent updates to the McDonald Criteria have emphasized the integration of CSF biomarkers with MRI findings, enhancing diagnostic sensitivity and allowing for earlier treatment interventions, which are crucial for improving long-term outcomes.",

    "option_d": "Switch to highly effective DMT",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system. Some patients experience paroxysmal symptoms (brief, recurrent episodes such as spasms or dysesthesias) that are not due to new inflammatory activity but rather to focal areas of hyperexcitability in demyelinated fibers. Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant, is effective in suppressing these paroxysmal discharges by stabilizing neuronal membranes. In MS, demyelinated axons may exhibit ectopic impulse generation resulting in paroxysmal phenomena. Carbamazepine works by blocking voltage\u2010gated sodium channels, thereby reducing high-frequency neuronal firing. This mechanistic effect helps control the brief, repetitive symptoms seen in stable MS patients with paroxysmal spasms. Patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) may present with transient paroxysmal spasms even in the absence of active inflammatory lesions on imaging. These episodes are distinct from acute relapses which typically involve new neurological deficits and are managed with steroids. Recognizing paroxysmal symptoms avoids unnecessary escalation of disease modifying therapies. Differential diagnoses include acute relapse of MS (which would often have MRI evidence of new lesions), seizure disorders, and other causes of episodic movement disorders. The absence of new disease activity on imaging along with the clinical pattern of brief, stereotyped episodes supports a diagnosis of paroxysmal phenomena in MS. The first-line treatment for paroxysmal symptoms in MS is an antiepileptic drug such as carbamazepine. In acute inflammatory relapses, high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) is indicated, and plasmapheresis is reserved for steroid-refractory cases. For patients who are pregnant or lactating, the use of carbamazepine requires careful risk\u2013benefit analysis as it is associated with teratogenic potential (pregnancy Category D); folate supplementation is strongly recommended and alternative agents (such as gabapentin) may be considered if appropriate. Option A (Carbamazepine) is correct because it specifically targets the paroxysmal spasms by stabilizing overactive nerve membranes. Option B (IVMP) is used for treating acute relapses rather than paroxysmal symptoms. Option C (PLEX) is reserved for severe, refractory demyelinating events, and Option D (Switch to highly effective DMT) is unnecessary in a patient with stable disease and isolated paroxysmal symptoms. 1. Paroxysmal symptoms in MS are due to ectopic nerve discharges in demyelinated fibers rather than new inflammatory activity. 2. Carbamazepine is highly effective for these brief, recurrent episodes. 3. Distinguishing between MS relapse and paroxysmal phenomena is crucial to avoid unnecessary changes in immunomodulatory therapy. Recent guidelines and expert consensus support the use of symptomatic antiepileptic drugs, including carbamazepine, for managing paroxysmal symptoms in MS. There is increasing recognition that these symptoms can occur independently of inflammatory activity and do not necessitate escalation of disease modifying therapy.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Small vessel vasculitis affecting the central nervous system is challenging to diagnose due to its patchy involvement and non-specific imaging findings. Histopathological confirmation via brain biopsy remains the gold standard because it provides direct evidence of vascular inflammation. Small vessel vasculitis involves an immune-mediated attack on the vessel walls leading to inflammation, necrosis, and eventual luminal narrowing. These changes may not be visualized on angiographic studies, especially when only small-caliber vessels are involved. Clinically, patients may have a range of neurological symptoms including headache, cognitive changes, focal deficits, and seizures. The variability in presentation stems from the often multifocal and patchy distribution of the vasculitic process within the brain. The differential diagnosis includes reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), infectious etiologies, secondary vasculitis from systemic diseases, and other inflammatory conditions. While angiography (e.g., DSA) is useful for medium to large vessel vasculitis, in small vessel vasculitis these modalities may appear normal. A brain biopsy, though invasive, can provide definitive histopathological evidence of vasculitis. Once diagnosed, treatment generally involves high-dose corticosteroids as an initial step, with cyclophosphamide often added for more severe or refractory cases. In pregnant or lactating women, corticosteroids remain the mainstay of therapy, but cyclophosphamide is contraindicated due to teratogenicity and potential harm during lactation. In such cases, alternative immunosuppressants may be considered after careful risk\u2013benefit analysis. Option A (response to corticosteroid) is non-diagnostic because many inflammatory processes may improve with steroids. Option B (brain biopsy) is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis in suspected small vessel vasculitis. Option C (DSA) is inadequate for small vessel involvement because it primarily visualizes larger vessels. Option D is absent. 1. Brain biopsy has a high specificity for CNS vasculitis but may have sampling limitations due to the patchy nature of the disease. 2. Angiographic studies like DSA are more useful in large vessel vasculitis rather than small vessel types. 3. A high clinical suspicion is essential for early diagnosis and treatment of CNS vasculitis. Recent literature emphasizes a multimodal diagnostic approach for CNS vasculitis, integrating clinical, radiological, and histopathological data. Despite advances in imaging, brain biopsy remains essential for confirming small vessel involvement.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Optic neuritis is typically characterized by sudden visual loss and pain, especially with eye movements. However, when optic neuritis is accompanied by significant optic disc swelling (papilledema), it raises the suspicion of a variant underlying etiology. Anti-MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) antibodies are increasingly recognized in patients with optic neuritis who exhibit pronounced disc edema. Anti-MOG associated disease is distinct from typical multiple sclerosis. In these patients, antibodies target the MOG protein located on the surface of oligodendrocytes, leading to a demyelinating process that often presents with more severe inflammation and optic nerve head swelling (papillitis) compared to the retrobulbar involvement seen in MS. Patients with MOG-associated optic neuritis tend to have more severe visual impairment and marked optic disc swelling compared to classic MS-related optic neuritis, which is usually retrobulbar and may present with a normal-appearing fundus. This distinction is important as it can influence management and prognosis. The differential diagnosis includes typical MS-related optic neuritis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD, often associated with anti-AQP4 antibodies), and idiopathic optic neuritis. In scenarios with prominent disc swelling, testing for anti-MOG antibodies via serum assay is recommended. Neuroimaging can help exclude intracranial hypertension. Acute attacks of MOG-associated optic neuritis are typically treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, followed by an oral taper. For steroid-resistant cases, plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be considered. In pregnant or lactating patients, high-dose corticosteroids can be used with careful monitoring, although alternative immunosuppressants may be deferred due to potential risks. Option A (anti-MOG) is appropriate because the presence of papilledema in the setting of optic neuritis is a strong indicator for MOG-associated disease. Other potential options (not provided here) such as anti-AQP4 testing or imaging studies would be considered in different clinical scenarios; however, for the case described, anti-MOG testing is the most direct and relevant investigation. 1. MOG-associated optic neuritis often presents with significant optic disc swelling, differentiating it from typical retrobulbar optic neuritis seen in MS. 2. Early identification via anti-MOG antibody testing is critical for appropriate treatment and prognosis. 3. MOG-related diseases represent a distinct immunological entity requiring tailored management approaches. Recent studies and updated guidelines highlight that MOG antibody testing should be considered in patients with optic neuritis who exhibit atypical features such as marked disc edema. This has led to improved diagnostic accuracy and targeted therapy for MOG-associated disorders.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuroimmunology",
    "explanation": "Among the various disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis, some are associated with significant immunosuppression leading to an increased risk of viral reactivation. Prophylactic antiviral therapy is sometimes indicated to mitigate this risk. Alemtuzumab (marketed here as \u2018Almetazimap\u2019) is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, leading to rapid and profound lymphocyte depletion. This immunosuppressive effect predisposes patients to opportunistic infections, notably reactivation of herpes viruses, hence necessitating the use of prophylactic antiviral agents such as acyclovir. Patients receiving alemtuzumab are at increased risk for infections, particularly herpetic infections. This clinical scenario mandates the initiation of antiviral prophylaxis to prevent reactivation of latent herpes infections, which can lead to significant morbidity. While no specific diagnostic test is needed for prophylaxis, baseline serologies (e.g., varicella zoster virus IgG) are often evaluated before starting therapy. The differential risk profile among DMTs is considered when choosing prophylactic measures. Current guidelines recommend that patients starting on alemtuzumab receive prophylactic antiviral therapy, typically acyclovir, for at least 2 months post-infusion to reduce the risk of herpes viral reactivation. In pregnant or lactating patients, the overall use of alemtuzumab is generally avoided due to its potent immunosuppressive effects and potential teratogenicity; if used, the need for antiviral prophylaxis remains unchanged but must be balanced with the risks on a case-by-case basis. Option A (finglomoid/fingolimod) does not routinely require prophylactic antiviral agents, although varicella zoster immune status should be verified. Option B (Almetazimap, representing alemtuzumab) is correct as it necessitates antiviral prophylaxis due to its profound lymphocyte depletion. Option C (natilazemab/natalizumab) and Option D (Terifinolomoid/teriflunomide) are not typically associated with the same need for routine antiviral prophylaxis. 1. Alemtuzumab\u2019s immunosuppressive action significantly increases the risk of herpes virus reactivation, warranting routine antiviral prophylaxis. 2. Pre-treatment screening for viral immunity (e.g., varicella zoster) is an important step in the management of patients scheduled for alemtuzumab therapy. 3. The risk\u2013benefit assessment of DMTs must include infection risk and the need for prophylactic measures. Recent clinical guidelines and post-marketing surveillance data underscore the need for prophylactic antiviral therapy with alemtuzumab to reduce infectious complications. This approach is well established in the updated consensus recommendations for managing high-efficacy DMTs in MS.",
