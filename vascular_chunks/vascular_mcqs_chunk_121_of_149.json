    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Embolic strokes occur when a clot formed elsewhere, most commonly in the heart, dislodges and travels to the cerebral circulation. When routine etiological work\u2010up (e.g., basic transthoracic echocardiography, carotid ultrasound) is unremarkable, the stroke remains cryptogenic or classified as an Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS). In many cryptogenic strokes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is suspected even though it can be missed on a standard workup. Clots form in the left atrium or appendage due to stasis, and intermittent arrhythmia leads to embolization. Up\u2010to\u2010date evidence, including studies such as the CRYSTAL\u2010AF trial, supports that prolonged cardiac monitoring increases detection of intermittent arrhythmias as the inciting cause. Patients with embolic strokes typically present with sudden focal neurological deficits. In cases where the conventional workup proves negative, the clinical suspicion for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation remains high, and this may be the hidden source of embolism. After initial neuroimaging (CT/MRI) and cardiac evaluation with TTE/TEE have ruled out obvious sources, the next diagnostic step is long-term cardiac monitoring. Differential diagnoses include other embolic sources (e.g., aortic arch atheroma), small vessel lacunar strokes, or non-embolic etiologies; however, the multifocal embolic pattern generally steers workup toward paroxysmal arrhythmias. First-line management after a negative routine workup is to utilize prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring (e.g., a 30-day event monitor or even an implantable loop recorder if indicated) to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. If AF is detected, long-term anticoagulation is recommended. In pregnant or lactating patients, if anticoagulation becomes necessary, unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred due to their safety profiles during pregnancy and lactation. Although the specific answer choices aren\u2019t provided, answer option B is assumed to represent the choice of extended cardiac monitoring. This is the correct next step after a negative initial evaluation in a patient with an embolic stroke pattern. 1. Cryptogenic strokes account for a significant proportion of embolic strokes where routine testing is negative. 2. Prolonged cardiac monitoring increases the diagnostic yield for detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 3. Once AF is documented, the management pivots to anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy. Recent trials like CRYSTAL\u2010AF and EMBRACE have solidified the role of prolonged cardiac monitoring in detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke, influencing recent guideline recommendations from the American Stroke Association.",

    "question": "Scenario for ischemic stroke, imaging showed bilateral anterior and posterior circulation strokes, what is the best step for management of this patient if TTE and TEE were negative?",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "When imaging demonstrates strokes in both the anterior and posterior circulation bilaterally, a cardioembolic source is highly suspected. Even if initial cardiac studies (TTE and TEE) are negative, intermittent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may still be the underlying cause. The mechanism behind such multi-territorial strokes is most often embolic in nature. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be elusive because its episodes may be transient. Negative echocardiographic studies do not rule out arrhythmogenic causes, hence the importance of prolonged rhythm monitoring. Patients with multi-territorial infarctions can present with a combination of neurological deficits affecting different regions. The finding of strokes in multiple vascular territories strongly suggests an embolic source even in the absence of structural abnormalities on TTE/TEE. After ruling out major cardiac sources with TTE and TEE, it is important to pursue extended monitoring, such as with Holter monitors or implantable loop recorders, to detect intermittent arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation. Differential considerations include aortic arch atheroma, hypercoagulable states, or less common embolic sources, but the clinical pattern directs the workup toward paroxysmal AF. In light of a negative TTE/TEE and a high clinical suspicion for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the first-line management is prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring. If atrial fibrillation is subsequently detected, then the patient should be managed with anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy. In pregnant or lactating patients, LMWH is currently preferred for anticoagulation due to its safety profile. Option B, which is presumed to represent the strategy of prolonged or extended cardiac monitoring, is correct. It targets the possibility of intermittent atrial fibrillation that may have been missed on initial examinations. 1. Bilateral and multi-territorial strokes strongly raise the suspicion of a cardioembolic source. 2. Negative initial echocardiograms do not exclude paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 3. Prolonged cardiac monitoring can reveal intermittent arrhythmias that guide appropriate anticoagulation therapy. Recent studies and guideline updates emphasize the diagnostic utility of prolonged cardiac monitoring (e.g., via the EMBRACE or CRYSTAL-AF trials) in evaluating patients with ESUS, reinforcing this strategy in clinical practice.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Progressive myelopathy refers to a slowly worsening dysfunction of the spinal cord. In older adults, one of the most common causes is degenerative changes in the cervical spine, commonly known as cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is caused by chronic degenerative changes such as disc herniation, osteophyte formation, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and sometimes ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. These changes lead to narrowing of the spinal canal (stenosis) and subsequent compression of the spinal cord. Patients typically present with gradual onset of motor weakness, gait instability, sensory disturbances, and in some cases, hyperreflexia. The progression is usually insidious, reflecting the slow nature of degenerative changes in the cervical spine. Diagnosis is established with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, which reveals features such as spinal canal narrowing and intramedullary hyperintensities indicative of cord compression. Differential diagnoses include demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis), intramedullary tumors, infectious processes (e.g., spinal epidural abscess), and inflammatory conditions. Correlation with clinical findings is essential. The first-line management often involves conservative treatment (physical therapy, pain management, and careful monitoring) in mild cases. However, in individuals with progressive neurological deficits, surgical decompression (e.g., anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or laminectomy) is recommended. For pregnant or lactating patients, the treatment approach must carefully weigh the risks and benefits; conservative management is preferred if the deficits are not severe, but if surgery is necessary, timing and anesthetic considerations become critical. Assuming option B corresponds to 'cervical spondylotic myelopathy', this is the correct choice based on the clinical picture and typical MRI findings associated with the condition. 1. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a common cause of progressive spinal cord compression in elderly patients. 2. MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice to evaluate for cord compression. 3. Early surgical intervention in progressive cases can improve neurological outcomes. Recent guidelines suggest that early surgical decompression in patients with moderate to severe deficits can lead to improved long-term outcomes. Ongoing research continues to refine the indications and timing for surgery based on imaging and clinical severity.",

    "option_b": "Stop tPA",
    "option_c": "Send him to CT",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Acute ischemic stroke treatment often includes intravenous thrombolysis (tPA) and, when indicated, endovascular thrombectomy. However, post-treatment complications must be vigilantly monitored. tPA increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation, especially in the setting of large infarct volumes or uncontrolled hypertension. A sudden deterioration, such as vomiting and lethargy, may signal an intracranial hemorrhage or increased intracranial pressure secondary to bleeding, particularly if blood pressure rises to levels like 180/110 mm Hg. In this scenario, the patient initially had a favorable CT (ASPECTS 8) and was being managed with tPA while being evaluated for thrombectomy. The subsequent acute neurological deterioration (vomiting, lethargy) in the context of elevated blood pressure is highly concerning for a hemorrhagic complication or neurologic worsening, warranting immediate re-evaluation. The first step in managing sudden neurological decline after thrombolysis is to rapidly re-image the brain using non-contrast CT to assess for hemorrhagic transformation. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct, malignant cerebral edema, or even an unrelated complication. Immediate imaging helps differentiate these conditions. According to current stroke guidelines, the initial management for any suspected hemorrhagic complication post tPA is to obtain emergent neuroimaging to confirm the diagnosis. Blood pressure management is also critical; while strict BP control (generally <185/110 mm Hg pre-tPA) is maintained during and after thrombolysis, any new neurological changes necessitate re-imaging before further interventions. In pregnant or lactating patients, imaging protocols remain the same, and care should be taken in selecting antihypertensive agents that are safe in these populations (e.g., labetalol or hydralazine). Option C, which directs the clinician to send the patient for an immediate CT scan, is the appropriate response. Options such as just decreasing blood pressure or stopping tPA are premature without confirming hemorrhage via re-imaging. The CT scan is needed to determine the correct next steps. 1. Any sudden neurological change during or after thrombolytic therapy should prompt immediate re-imaging. 2. Elevated blood pressure post-tPA, especially in the setting of neurological deterioration, raises concern for hemorrhage. 3. Adhering to BP thresholds during thrombolytic therapy is crucial to minimize hemorrhagic risk. Current guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association continue to stress the importance of urgent non-contrast head CT in the assessment of suspected hemorrhagic complications after tPA administration. Recent studies emphasize the predictive value of re-imaging when patients show clinical deterioration.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This case describes a hypertensive female presenting with seizures and confusion, with MRI findings of bilateral occipital cortical hyperintensities. The clinical picture is characteristic of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), a clinical\u2013radiological entity often seen in the setting of severe hypertension (and other triggers such as eclampsia, renal failure, or immunosuppressive therapy). PRES is believed to result from a failure of autoregulation in the cerebral vasculature caused primarily by sudden severe hypertension. This leads to endothelial dysfunction and subsequent vasogenic edema (predominantly in the posterior circulation\u2014in the parieto\u2010occipital regions). Recent research supports the idea that cerebral hyperperfusion and disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier are key mechanisms in its development. Patients with PRES present with headache, nausea, altered consciousness, visual disturbances, and seizures. The MRI typically shows symmetrical hyperintense lesions on T2/FLAIR sequences in the parieto-occipital lobes. The condition is reversible if promptly recognized and managed by controlling blood pressure and addressing the underlying cause. Diagnosis of PRES is primarily clinical and radiologic. Differential diagnoses include acute ischemic stroke (which usually demonstrates diffusion restriction on MRI), encephalitis, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). The bilateral and posterior distribution on MRI helps to distinguish PRES from other entities. Management focuses on rapid control of blood pressure using IV antihypertensive agents (e.g., nicardipine or labetalol) in a controlled fashion \u2013 typically targeting a 25% reduction in mean arterial pressure over the first few hours. Seizure control with anticonvulsants may be required. In pregnant patients (e.g., eclampsia), intravenous magnesium sulfate is indicated and BP management should be tailored to maternal and fetal risks; lactating mothers should be managed similarly with appropriate follow\u2010up. Option A (PRES) is correct. Although the option is noted as 'PRESS', it is understood to be a reference to Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome. No other options were given, and the presentation aligns perfectly with this diagnosis. 1. PRES is reversible with prompt management. 2. The typical MRI pattern is bilateral parieto-occipital vasogenic edema. 3. Severe hypertension is a key trigger. Recent guidelines emphasize careful blood pressure management and rapid identification of PRES. Neuroimaging (MRI) remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, and emerging literature continues to explore the various precipitating factors beyond hypertension, including drug toxicity and systemic inflammatory states.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In a 74\u2010year\u2010old male presenting with a cortical hemorrhage on CT, determining the cause of the hemorrhage is paramount. CT angiography (CTA) is the recommended next step, as it enables evaluation for underlying vascular abnormalities such as aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or the presence of active bleeding (spot sign). Intracerebral hemorrhages result from the rupture of abnormal or diseased vessels. In elderly patients, lobar hemorrhages may also be related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy; however, when the hemorrhage is large and cortical, evaluation for other vascular abnormalities is warranted. CTA can rapidly detect vascular anomalies that might have contributed to the bleed. The patient\u2019s clinical presentation along with the CT finding of a cortical hemorrhage suggests the need for urgent vascular imaging. CTA not only assists in identifying potential causes but also guides further management decisions (e.g., surgical intervention or conservative treatment). Following a non-contrast CT that identifies hemorrhage, the differential includes hypertensive hemorrhage, amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformations, and aneurysmal rupture. CTA helps differentiate these entities by visualizing the vascular structure. MRI can be useful later for parenchymal details, while conventional angiography is typically reserved for cases where CTA is non-diagnostic or for therapeutic intervention planning. Immediate management involves stabilization of the patient, blood pressure control, and reversal of anticoagulation if indicated. Guidelines suggest that CTA should be performed promptly to delineate the vascular anatomy and identify potential bleeding sources. In pregnant patients or lactating mothers, the risks and benefits of contrast exposure should be considered, but in life-threatening hemorrhage, maternal stabilization is prioritized. Option B (CTA) is correct because it provides a rapid, non-invasive method to evaluate the vascular anatomy in the setting of intracerebral hemorrhage. Option A (MRI) is less ideal in an acute hemorrhagic setting due to time constraints, while conventional angiography (Option C) is invasive and generally reserved for cases when non-invasive imaging is inconclusive or if endovascular therapy is contemplated. 1. CTA is critical in the acute evaluation of intracerebral hemorrhage to identify potential vascular abnormalities. 2. Lobar hemorrhages in the elderly warrant careful investigation for amyloid angiopathy and other vascular lesions. 3. Time is brain - rapid imaging guides management. Current stroke guidelines support the use of CTA following detection of intracerebral hemorrhage on CT to detect a bleeding source or vascular anomaly. It is now a standard component in the acute stroke imaging protocol, with recent studies validating its role in predicting hematoma expansion via the 'spot sign'.",

    "option_c": "PFO closure",
    "option_d": "Aspirin and plavix",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with a small left internal capsule infarction and right-sided weakness. Although a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is detected, the clinical context (lacunar infarct with uncontrolled hypertension) strongly favors a small vessel (lacunar) infarct due to hypertensive arteriopathy rather than an embolic event from a paradoxical embolism through the PFO. Lacunar infarcts occur due to occlusion of small penetrating arteries, typically as a consequence of chronic hypertension leading to arteriolosclerosis. While PFO can be a conduit for paradoxical emboli, its prevalence in the general population and the presence of significant vascular risk factors (like uncontrolled high blood pressure) point to a hypertensive etiology. Recent research emphasizes proper patient selection for PFO closure, typically in young patients with cryptogenic stroke. The location of the infarct (internal capsule) and the clinical picture of pure motor stroke are classic for a lacunar event. In this context, the incidental finding of a PFO is unlikely to be the culprit. The focus should be on antiplatelet therapy and rigorous blood pressure control to prevent further lacunar events. Diagnosis of a lacunar stroke is made based on clinical features and supported by imaging (often CT or MRI showing a small deep infarct). Differential diagnoses include embolic strokes (which typically involve cortical areas) and large artery atherosclerosis. A detailed cardiac evaluation and sometimes transesophageal echocardiography can be performed to assess the significance of a PFO, but only in selected cases of cryptogenic stroke in younger patients. First-line management for lacunar stroke involves antiplatelet therapy, with aspirin being the standard agent. Concurrently, aggressive management of hypertension is required to reduce recurrence risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) is generally not indicated beyond the acute period except in specific scenarios. PFO closure is reserved for younger patients (<60 years) with cryptogenic stroke and high-risk PFO characteristics. In pregnancy and lactation, low-dose aspirin is often considered safe under guidance, but blood pressure management remains the priority. Option A (Aspirin) is correct. Warfarin (Option B) is not indicated in lacunar strokes without a cardioembolic source, and PFO closure (Option C) is generally not recommended in older patients with a clear alternative stroke mechanism. Option D (aspirin and clopidogrel) is not part of standard long-term management for lacunar strokes in this scenario. 1. Lacunar strokes are typically due to small vessel disease related to uncontrolled hypertension. 2. An incidental PFO in an elderly patient with classic lacunar findings is not an indication for closure. 3. Strict control of blood pressure is critical to preventing recurrent lacunar strokes. Recent trials and meta-analyses underscore that PFO closure benefits are confined to younger patients with cryptogenic stroke and high-risk anatomical features. The current approach in older patients or those with clear alternative etiologies (like hypertension-induced small vessel disease) remains antiplatelet therapy and risk factor modification.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Alexia without agraphia, often termed 'pure alexia,' is a disconnection syndrome where a patient loses the ability to read but retains the ability to write. This syndrome is most commonly associated with infarction in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), particularly affecting the left occipital lobe and the splenium of the corpus callosum. The left occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual input, and the splenium of the corpus callosum connects the visual cortex to language areas in the dominant hemisphere. When both are compromised\u2014commonly due to an occlusion of the left PCA\u2014the patient can still write (as language production centers are intact) but cannot comprehend written words because visual input is not adequately relayed to these centers. Patients present with homonymous hemianopia (usually right-sided if the left PCA is involved) and a striking disassociation: the ability to write remains preserved while reading is impaired. This clinical presentation is pathognomonic for alexia without agraphia. Imaging, particularly MRI, will reveal infarction in the left occipital lobe and may show involvement of the splenium. Differential diagnoses include other forms of aphasia; however, the preservation of writing ability distinguishes alexia without agraphia. Additional evaluations, such as formal neuropsychological testing and visual field assessments, aid in confirmation. Acute management of PCA stroke is similar to other ischemic strokes, where the focus is on reperfusion strategies (if within the thrombolytic window), antiplatelet therapy, and supportive care. Long-term management includes risk factor modification. In pregnant or lactating patients, thrombolytic therapy is considered only after careful risk\u2013benefit analysis and usually in specialized centers; antiplatelet therapies such as low-dose aspirin are generally considered safe under medical supervision. Option A (PCA) is correct as the syndrome is a classic presentation of a stroke in the distribution of the posterior cerebral artery, particularly affecting the left side. The other options, if presented, would not align with the vascular territory involved in this specific disconnection syndrome. 1. Alexia without agraphia is a classic disconnection syndrome resulting from left occipital and splenium involvement. 2. A key feature is the loss of reading ability in the presence of preserved writing skills. 3. It is most commonly associated with infarction of the PCA territory. Recent stroke management guidelines continue to emphasize the importance of rapid diagnosis and reperfusion in acute ischemic strokes, including PCA infarcts. Advances in neuroimaging have improved the accuracy of localizing the infarct and predicting outcomes in disconnection syndromes such as alexia without agraphia.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question evaluates the understanding of cerebellar vascular territories and their infarction patterns. The cerebellum is supplied by three major arteries: the Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA), Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA), and Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA). A lesion seen at the level of the midbrain in the cerebellum is most consistent with the SCA territory. An infarction in the SCA territory occurs when there is occlusion, typically due to thromboembolism or local atherosclerotic disease, leading to ischemia of the superior aspect of the cerebellum. This ischemia disrupts cerebellar circuits responsible for coordination, resulting in ataxia, and can also affect vestibular integration, contributing to symptoms like vomiting. Clinically, a patient with an SCA infarct usually presents with acute cerebellar symptoms such as ataxia, imbalance, and vomiting. CT imaging will demonstrate hypodensity within the affected cerebellar region. The midbrain level slice implicates the superior portion of the cerebellum, which is supplied by the SCA. The diagnosis is initially established using non-contrast CT to identify hypodense areas indicating ischemia. MRI (especially diffusion-weighted imaging) is more sensitive in the acute setting. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic stroke, cerebellar tumors, demyelinating lesions, and infarctions in other cerebellar territories (PICA or AICA infarcts), which are distinguished by their specific vascular distribution and imaging characteristics. Management begins with acute stroke protocols including IV thrombolysis if within the time window, supportive care, and monitoring for complications like edema and hydrocephalus. In selected cases, neurosurgical decompression may be indicated. In pregnant patients, the risk\u2010benefit assessment for thrombolytics is critical, with a preference for imaging modalities and treatments that minimize fetal radiation exposure. For lactating mothers, treatment adjustments may be needed to avoid transmission of potentially teratogenic agents. Option A (SCA) is correct because the CT at the level of the midbrain with whole cerebellar involvement on the right side fits the SCA infarction pattern. Option B (PCA) is incorrect because the PCA supplies the occipital lobe. Option C (PICA) typically affects the inferior cerebellum, and Option D (AICA) supplies the anterior inferior portion of the cerebellum, neither matching the described imaging level. 1. In cerebellar strokes, early identification is key due to the risk of brainstem compression and hydrocephalus. 2. A CT slice at the midbrain level that shows cerebellar hypodensity is most suggestive of an SCA infarct. 3. Vomiting and ataxia without significant long tract signs point toward a localized cerebellar event. Recent guidelines emphasize early neuroimaging and prompt thrombolytic therapy, if appropriate, for ischemic stroke. Advances in MRI techniques help differentiate among cerebellar infarctions and assess for mass effect. Research continues to refine the management of posterior circulation strokes, particularly regarding surgical interventions in cases of cerebellar edema.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question centers on the evaluation of hypercoagulable states leading to both thrombotic events (such as stroke) and recurrent pregnancy loss. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a prime example where autoimmune antibodies create a proclivity for thrombosis, manifesting in both obstetric and vascular complications. In APS, autoantibodies (including lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein I) interact with phospholipids and coagulation factors, leading to endothelial dysfunction and a hypercoagulable state. This results in thrombosis in both arteries and veins, as well as placental thrombosis, which can cause recurrent miscarriages. A young woman with a history of two abortions who now presents with a stroke fits the clinical picture of APS. The dual presentation of recurrent pregnancy loss and arterial thrombosis is highly suggestive of this syndrome, prompting evaluation with antiphospholipid antibody testing. The diagnostic workup includes testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein I antibodies, with repeat testing 12 weeks apart to confirm persistent positivity. Differential diagnoses include other thrombophilias such as Protein C deficiency, Protein S deficiency, and Factor V Leiden mutation; however, these rarely present with recurrent abortions to the degree seen in APS. Management of APS involves long-term anticoagulation. For a patient with a stroke, warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.0 is often used; however, in women of childbearing age, especially during pregnancy, warfarin is contraindicated. In pregnancy, low molecular weight heparin in combination with low-dose aspirin is recommended to reduce both thrombotic and obstetric complications. Breastfeeding mothers are generally safely managed with heparin therapy. Option A (Protein C deficiency) and Option B (Antithrombin 3 deficiency) are inherited thrombophilias that can cause thrombosis but are less commonly associated with recurrent miscarriages. Option D (Protein glycoprotein 20220 mutation) is associated with thrombosis but again, the combination of stroke and recurrent abortions is most suggestive of APS, making Option C the correct choice. 1. Recurrent pregnancy loss combined with thrombotic events is a classic presentation of APS. 2. Confirmatory testing for APS requires demonstration of persistent positivity for antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions, at least 12 weeks apart. 3. Management strategies differ drastically during pregnancy, with a shift toward heparin-based therapies. Recent guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology and hematology recommend aggressive anticoagulation in APS patients with thrombotic events. There is increasing evidence to support the combination of low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose aspirin in pregnant patients to reduce both thrombotic risk and miscarriage rates. Additionally, DOACs are being evaluated but have not yet supplanted warfarin or heparin in high-risk APS, especially in a pregnant population.",

    "option_c": "PICA",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question tests the recognition of signs indicative of cervical arterial dissection following mild head trauma. The combination of Horner\u2019s syndrome and tongue deviation strongly implicates involvement of structures near the internal carotid artery. A dissection of the internal carotid artery can occur after even minor trauma, resulting in a tear in the arterial wall. This allows blood to dissect into the vessel wall, which may compromise the adjacent sympathetic plexus (producing Horner's syndrome) and affect the nearby hypoglossal nerve (resulting in ipsilateral tongue deviation). Patients with internal carotid dissection often present with neck pain, headache, and signs of cranial nerve dysfunction. The presence of a unilateral Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) coupled with tongue deviation to the same side is almost pathognomonic for carotid dissection, making the recognition of these signs critical. Noninvasive imaging modalities such as CT angiography or MR angiography are used to diagnose carotid dissection. Differential diagnoses include vertebral artery dissection (which may not produce Horner\u2019s syndrome) and brainstem stroke (which would present with additional brainstem signs). Ultrasound is less sensitive for dissections in the high cervical region. The standard management of internal carotid dissection involves antithrombotic therapy, which may be antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation, based on the individual patient\u2019s risk factors and contraindications. In pregnancy and lactation, low molecular weight heparin is preferred due to its safety profile. Option A (Internal carotid) is correct because dissection in this artery accounts for the presence of ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome and involvement of the hypoglossal nerve, which leads to tongue deviation. Option B (Vertebral artery) is less likely to cause these specific cranial nerve findings. Options C (PICA) and D (Basilar) are not associated with the described constellation of symptoms. 1. Horner's syndrome in a post-trauma setting should prompt evaluation for carotid dissection. 2. Tongue deviation toward the side of the lesion implicates lower cranial nerve involvement near the carotid artery. 3. Early vascular imaging is critical in patients with suspected dissection to prevent ischemic complications. Recent studies emphasize the role of early MRI/MRA in diagnosing cervical artery dissections, with guidelines recommending prompt initiation of antithrombotic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke. In pregnant patients, the use of LMWH remains the mainstay due to its established safety profile over warfarin or DOACs.",

    "correct_answer": "Fabry",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This case describes a clinical presentation typical of Fabry disease, a multisystem X-linked lysosomal storage disorder. The hallmark cutaneous manifestation is angiokeratomas, which when combined with a history of strokes in a relatively young patient, strongly suggests Fabry disease. Fabry disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, leading to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in various tissues including vascular endothelium, kidneys, heart, and the nervous system. This accumulation results in progressive organ damage, vascular dysfunction, and an increased risk of cerebrovascular events. Patients with Fabry disease often present with angiokeratomas, acroparesthesias, and frequently experience strokes or transient ischemic attacks at a young age. Other features may include corneal verticillata, renal insufficiency, and cardiac issues. The combination of cutaneous findings and recurrent strokes is highly distinctive for Fabry disease. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by measuring alpha-galactosidase A enzyme activity in blood or leukocytes, followed by genetic testing. Differential diagnoses include Moyamoya disease (which has a characteristic angiographic pattern without skin lesions), CADASIL (a hereditary small vessel disease with white matter changes and no angiokeratomas), homocystinuria (which typically presents with lens dislocation and marfanoid habitus), and sickle cell disease (associated with hemolytic anemia). Treatment of Fabry disease primarily involves enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase beta or agalsidase alfa, which helps reduce the accumulation of Gb3. Supportive therapies may include pain management and addressing organ-specific complications. In pregnant patients, the decision to continue ERT is made on a case-by-case basis after weighing potential risks and benefits, though many experts favor continuation if maternal benefit is significant. Lactating mothers should be counseled, and therapy adjusted as needed given the limited data. The correct answer is Fabry disease. Hypothetical alternatives such as Moyamoya disease, CADASIL, and homocystinuria do not have the pathognomonic presence of angiokeratomas and have other distinguishing clinical features that do not match this case. 1. Angiokeratomas are a classic dermatologic hallmark of Fabry disease. 2. Early stroke in a young patient, when combined with multisystem involvement, should raise suspicion for a lysosomal storage disorder. 3. Enzyme replacement therapy is the cornerstone of management and may help prevent progression of organ damage. Recent research supports early initiation of enzyme replacement therapy to delay the progression of Fabry-related complications. Updated guidelines emphasize periodic monitoring of cardiac, renal, and neurologic function. There is also ongoing research into alternative therapies, including oral chaperone molecules, which may complement or offer alternatives to ERT in the future.",

    "option_b": "",
    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Watershed infarcts occur in border zones between major cerebral arterial territories. In this case, a unilateral deep watershed infarction seen on an MRI flare image indicates a region particularly vulnerable to hypoperfusion. Typically, when such an infarct is unilateral, it points to a focal hemodynamic compromise rather than a global hypotensive event. In patients with significant internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, the distal perfusion pressure drops enough to compromise blood flow in the terminal distributions (the watershed zones). The reduced flow fails to fully oxygenate tissues in these territories, leading to ischemic injury. The 'flare' signal on MRI corresponds to the acute/subacute phase of ischemia in these deep white matter areas. Patients with unilateral watershed infarctions usually exhibit milder, sometimes fluctuating, neurological deficits attributable to the compromised blood supply on one side. Associated clinical findings, such as the presence of a carotid bruit and vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, atherosclerosis), further support the diagnosis of ICA stenosis as the underlying cause. Initial evaluation with neuroimaging, like MRI and CT, identifies the location and pattern of ischemia. Carotid Doppler ultrasonography, CT angiography or MR angiography can help assess the degree of ICA stenosis. Differential diagnoses include global hypoperfusion states, embolic events from other sources, or small vessel disease, which can be differentiated based on clinical history and imaging characteristics. For patients with ICA stenosis leading to watershed infarction, first-line management includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, possibly combined with clopidogrel in select cases), high-intensity statin therapy, and aggressive risk factor modification (hypertension, diabetes, smoking cessation). If the stenosis is high-grade and symptomatic, revascularization options like carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting are considered. In pregnancy or lactation, risk factor management employs agents with established safety profiles (e.g., low-dose aspirin) and decisions regarding surgical intervention are highly individualized after multidisciplinary consultation. Option A (ICA stenosis) is correct because unilateral deep watershed infarction is typically due to a focal reduction in blood flow from ipsilateral carotid stenosis. Other options are not provided, but none would better explain the unilateral deep border zone pattern seen on MRI. 1. Unilateral watershed infarcts are a strong clue for ipsilateral carotid disease. 2. Always evaluate for carotid stenosis in patients with focal ischemic strokes in border zones. 3. Early revascularization in selected patients can prevent recurrent events. Recent studies emphasize the importance of identifying carotid stenosis in patients with border zone infarcts. Guidelines support aggressive medical management with antithrombotic therapy and risk factor modification, and in selected cases, carotid revascularization has been shown to reduce stroke recurrence rates.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In hemorrhagic stroke, the primary goal is to prevent hematoma expansion and secondary brain injury by tightly controlling blood pressure. The optimal blood pressure target is essential to balance the risk of rebleeding against the need to preserve adequate cerebral perfusion. Elevated BP raises the transmural pressure across cerebral vessels, which can worsen bleeding and expand the hemorrhage. By reducing blood pressure, the stress on vessel walls diminishes, potentially limiting the expansion of the hemorrhage and reducing subsequent edema and intracranial pressure. Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) often present with sudden-onset headaches, vomiting, altered mental status, and focal neurologic deficits. Aggressive BP management has been shown to limit hematoma growth in this subgroup. Initial noncontrast CT scan differentiates hemorrhagic from ischemic stroke. In the setting of ICH, BP measurement is critical. Differential diagnosis includes ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation and subarachnoid hemorrhage, but imaging readily distinguishes these entities. Current AHA/ASA guidelines recommend lowering the systolic blood pressure to around 140 mm Hg in patients presenting with ICH if the initial systolic BP is between 150 and 220 mm Hg. First-line agents include intravenous short-acting antihypertensives such as nicardipine or labetalol. In pregnant or lactating patients, labetalol is often preferred due to its safety profile, and nicardipine may also be considered with appropriate maternal-fetal monitoring. Option A (160/100) represents a less aggressive BP target and does not align with the current evidence-based recommendations, making Option B (140/90) the correct target for BP management in hemorrhagic stroke. 1. Rapid BP reduction in ICH helps minimize hematoma expansion. 2. Intravenous nicardipine and labetalol are commonly used agents in acute stroke settings. 3. Always consider the safety profile of antihypertensive agents in pregnancy and lactation. Interventional trials such as INTERACT2 have demonstrated that rapid BP lowering to a systolic target of 140 mm Hg is safe and may improve functional outcomes in patients with ICH, leading to its endorsement in current guidelines.",

    "option_d": "Hypoperfusion",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarctions can result from various stroke mechanisms. In the setting of trauma, such as a car accident, vascular injury\u2014particularly cervical artery dissection\u2014is a well-documented cause. This dissection can lead to artery-to-artery embolism causing infarction in the PCA territory. Blunt trauma from a car accident can injure the cervical arteries (especially the vertebral arteries), leading to dissection. The tear in the vessel wall creates an intramural hematoma that can either cause local luminal narrowing or serve as a source for thrombus formation. Embolic fragments from this thrombus can then travel distally to occlude branches such as the PCA. Clinically, a PCA infarction may present with visual field deficits, such as homonymous hemianopia, along with other signs that reflect the affected posterior circulation territory. In patients with a recent history of trauma, a cervical artery dissection must be actively considered. A high index of suspicion should prompt vascular imaging (e.g., CT angiography or MR angiography of the neck) to evaluate for dissection. Differential diagnoses include cardioembolic stroke (common in atrial fibrillation), cryptogenic stroke, or hypoperfusion states\u2014all of which are less likely in the context of a trauma history. Management of cervical artery dissection typically includes antithrombotic therapy\u2014either antiplatelets or anticoagulation\u2014as first-line treatment. The choice between them is patient-specific, with recent studies (such as the CADISS trial) showing similar outcomes. In pregnant or lactating patients, antiplatelet therapy (e.g., low-dose aspirin) or low molecular weight heparin (which has an excellent safety profile) can be used, avoiding warfarin due to teratogenic risks. Option A (Artery to artery) is correct as it best describes the mechanism of stroke in a patient with recent trauma. The likely scenario is a cervical artery dissection leading to thrombus formation and subsequent embolization to the PCA territory. Options such as cardioembolic or cryptogenic are less supported by the history of a car accident, and hypoperfusion is not typical for an isolated PCA infarction. 1. Always consider cervical artery dissection as a cause of stroke in patients with a recent history of neck trauma. 2. Vertebral artery dissection is a common mechanism resulting in posterior circulation strokes. 3. Early vascular imaging is crucial to confirm the diagnosis. Recent guidelines and studies, including those emerging from the CADISS trial, advocate for early diagnosis of cervical artery dissection and support antithrombotic management. Both antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies have shown comparable efficacy in preventing stroke recurrence in this population.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) is a benign, self-limited syndrome characterized by sudden onset of anterograde amnesia along with repetitive questioning, lasting up to 24 hours. Importantly, the patient\u2019s personal identity remains intact and there are no other focal neurological deficits. The exact cause of TGA remains unclear, though hypotheses include transient ischemia, migraine-related phenomena, or venous congestion. Despite various theories, TGA is recognized as a distinct clinical syndrome with excellent prognosis and no lasting neurological impairment. Clinically, TGA presents with confusion and repetitive questioning for a few hours while preserving awareness of personal identity and recognition of familiar people. The hallmark is the abrupt loss of the ability to form new memories, with resolution typically within 24 hours. Diagnosis of TGA is primarily clinical. While neuroimaging (MRI, particularly with diffusion-weighted imaging) may be obtained in atypical cases to exclude alternative diagnoses such as stroke, seizure, or encephalitis, extensive workup (EEG, lumbar puncture) is generally unnecessary if the presentation is classic. Differential diagnoses include transient ischemic attack, complex partial seizures, and psychogenic amnesia, all of which are distinguished based on the detailed history, duration, and associated neurological signs. The mainstay of TGA management is reassurance and observation, as the condition is benign and resolves spontaneously. There is no need for acute aggressive intervention. However, if there is any atypical feature or if the history raises suspicion for other conditions, further evaluation (e.g., brain MRI) may be warranted. In pregnancy or lactation, the same approach applies since the condition is benign; unnecessary invasive testing is avoided to protect both the mother and the fetus. Option D (which implies no further invasive workup and instead recommends reassurance/observation) is correct. Options A (EEG), B (Brain CT & CTA), and C (Lumbar puncture) are not routinely indicated in classic TGA because the syndrome is self-limited and additional testing may lead to unnecessary interventions and anxiety. 1. TGA is self-limiting and generally resolves within 24 hours with complete recovery of memory functions. 2. Routine neuroimaging or invasive testing is not necessary in classic presentations of TGA. 3. A thorough history and clinical examination are paramount to distinguish TGA from stroke, seizure, or infection. Current literature supports the diagnosis of TGA based on clinical criteria. Recent studies emphasize the high diagnostic yield of a detailed history and recommend reserved use of neuroimaging only in atypical cases. Guidelines underscore that reassurance and observation remain the primary approach for classic TGA presentations.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Prevention in medicine is classified into primary (preventing onset), secondary (early detection and treatment), and tertiary (reducing disability and improving quality of life after disease onset). In stroke management, referral to a speech therapist and rehab service to address slurred speech is a classic example of tertiary prevention, as it aims to restore function and minimize long\u2010term deficits. Stroke results in neuronal injury and loss of function depending on the area of the brain affected. In cases where speech production is impaired due to cortical or subcortical damage, neuroplasticity and rehabilitation work to reorganize and strengthen alternative neural pathways. This process underpins the rationale for involving speech therapy and other rehabilitative services after the acute incident. A patient presenting with post-stroke slurred speech benefits from a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. Speech therapy helps improve communication skills while overall rehabilitation addresses other potential deficits, thereby improving daily functioning and overall quality of life. Diagnosis of stroke relies on neuroimaging (CT or MRI) to define the lesion. Differential considerations include transient ischemic attacks and hemorrhagic strokes. The need for rehabilitation confirms the persistence of deficits that require long-term management. Rehabilitation is a key component of post-stroke care. Current guidelines recommend early initiation of speech, physical, and occupational therapy to enhance recovery. Special populations, such as pregnant or lactating patients, should receive individualized therapy plans that consider both maternal benefits and fetal safety. Medications or interventions used in the acute phase (e.g., thrombolytics) have their own separate guidelines, while rehabilitation remains a supportive, non-pharmacologic strategy. Option A (Primary prevention) addresses measures to prevent the initial occurrence and is not applicable here. Option B (Secondary prevention) refers to immediate interventions after the stroke to prevent recurrence (e.g., antiplatelets, statins). Option C (Tertiary prevention) is correct because it includes rehabilitative interventions that aim to reduce long-term disability. 1. Early rehabilitation post-stroke is associated with improved neurological recovery. 2. Distinguishing between types of prevention is essential for understanding different stages of patient care. Recent American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the importance of early, multidisciplinary rehabilitation post-stroke in order to maximize neuroplasticity and functional recovery, reinforcing the role of tertiary prevention in modern stroke management.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) is a condition characterized by transient constriction of cerebral blood vessels that can lead to severe headaches and sometimes neurologic deficits. The goal of treatment is to relieve vasospasm and support cerebral blood flow. RCVS involves a dysregulation of cerebrovascular tone, leading to segmental vasoconstriction. The condition is largely non-inflammatory. Calcium channel blockers like nimodipine work by inhibiting calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, promoting vasodilation, and reducing the severity of vasospasm. Clinically, RCVS often presents with recurrent thunderclap headaches. While supportive care measures like IV hydration are important, they do not directly reverse the vasoconstriction. Nimodipine alleviates the vascular spasm and improves symptoms, making it the treatment of choice. Diagnosis is typically established via imaging studies such as CTA, MRA, or conventional angiography, which show segmental narrowing of the cerebral arteries. Differential diagnoses include aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, primary angiitis of the CNS, and migrainous syndromes. First-line management for RCVS is the administration of nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker that targets the underlying mechanism of vasospasm. Supportive care such as analgesia and careful blood pressure management are essential adjuncts. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of nimodipine requires careful assessment; while data are limited, its benefits in reversibility of vasospasm often outweigh potential risks when managed under specialist guidance. Option A (IV hydration) is supportive but insufficient as definitive therapy. Option B (Steroids) are contraindicated because RCVS is non-inflammatory and steroids may worsen vasoconstriction. Option C (Nimodipine) is correct as it directly addresses the pathophysiologic mechanism of vasospasm. Option D (ASA) is not indicated since antiplatelet therapy does not target the dysregulated vascular tone and could potentially raise hemorrhagic risks. 1. RCVS should be suspected in patients with sudden, severe (thunderclap) headaches. 2. Nimodipine remains the mainstay of therapy for alleviating vasospasm in RCVS. Recent studies and clinical practice guidelines consistently support nimodipine as the first-line treatment for RCVS. Ongoing research focuses on optimizing dosing and managing the syndrome in special populations, including postpartum women.",

    "explanation": "Brainstem syndromes often exhibit 'crossed findings'\u2014ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral motor or sensory deficits. Recognizing this pattern helps in localizing the lesion within the brainstem. The midbrain contains both the oculomotor nerve (CN III) nuclei/fascicles and the corticospinal tract. An infarct affecting the bases of the midbrain can damage these adjacent structures simultaneously, producing ipsilateral CN III palsy and contralateral hemiparesis\u2014classically seen in Weber syndrome. A patient presenting with oculomotor nerve palsy (leading to diplopia, ptosis, and possibly pupillary involvement) alongside contralateral motor weakness should raise suspicion for a midbrain lesion. This clinical constellation is pathognomonic. Neuroimaging, preferably MRI, is used to confirm the lesion's location. The differential diagnosis must consider pontine or medullary lesions; however, such regions don't harbor the oculomotor nerve, thereby narrowing the probable site to the midbrain. Management adheres to standard stroke protocols, including acute reperfusion strategies when eligible and subsequent rehabilitation to address motor and cranial deficits. In pregnant or lactating patients, treatment selection (including thrombolysis) must be individualized to balance maternal benefits with fetal safety.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "When a patient presents with a cranial nerve III palsy combined with ipsilateral ataxia, the clinical syndrome most consistent with this presentation is Claude syndrome. It highlights a specific midbrain involvement where both oculomotor function and cerebellar coordination are affected. Claude syndrome results from a lesion in the midbrain that interrupts the oculomotor nerve fibers as well as adjacent structures involved in cerebellar coordination (such as the red nucleus or superior cerebellar peduncle). This leads to the combination of ocular motor deficits and cerebellar ataxia on the same side. Patients with Claude syndrome typically display signs of CN III dysfunction (ptosis, diplopia, and potential pupillary involvement) along with ipsilateral ataxia. This contrasts with other midbrain syndromes where additional contralateral motor deficits or involuntary movements may be evident. Differential diagnosis includes other midbrain syndromes: Weber syndrome (characterized by contralateral hemiparesis), Benedikt syndrome (which involves contralateral involuntary movements), and Nothnagel syndrome (a less common entity with overlapping features). MRI is pivotal for accurate localization of the lesion. Management of Claude syndrome follows acute stroke management protocols, including potential thrombolysis if within the therapeutic window and supportive care thereafter. Subsequent rehabilitation focusing on ocular motor control and coordination is essential. In pregnant or lactating patients, care should be taken to use agents with proven safety profiles while ensuring prompt treatment to minimize long-term disability. Option A (Claude syndrome) is correct because it exactly matches the clinical picture of CN III palsy with ipsilateral ataxia.

Accurate anatomical localization is critical for differentiating between various midbrain syndromes. The traditional descriptions of midbrain syndromes, including Claude syndrome, remain valid.
