    "explanation": "Ophthalmic artery (OA) infarction is an ocular ischemic event resulting from an abrupt interruption of blood flow to the retina. This condition is most commonly associated with embolic or thrombotic occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, a branch of the internal carotid artery. When the ophthalmic artery is occluded, the retina suffers an abrupt ischemic insult because it has minimal collateral supply. The resulting retinal ischemia quickly leads to cell death and irreversible vision loss unless very prompt interventions are instituted. The embolus may originate from atherosclerotic plaques or cardioembolic sources. Clinically, OA infarction presents as sudden, usually painless, monocular visual loss. Patients may also exhibit a relative afferent pupillary defect on examination with fundoscopic findings such as a pale retina with a cherry-red spot at the fovea. In contrast, signs such as ipsilateral Horner syndrome or hearing loss are more typical with other vascular territories (e.g., carotid dissection or labyrinthine infarction). Diagnosis is made with an urgent ophthalmologic evaluation including fundoscopic exam and ancillary tests such as fluorescein angiography. Vascular imaging (e.g., carotid Doppler ultrasound or CTA) should be pursued to identify embolic sources. Differential diagnoses include central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) from other causes, giant cell arteritis (in older individuals), and acute optic neuritis. Management is considered emergent. Options include measures aimed at dislodging the embolus (e.g., ocular massage, intraocular pressure reduction with medications) and systemic management (antiplatelet agents, risk factor optimization). There is limited evidence for thrombolytic or surgical interventions in this setting. In pregnant or lactating patients, any systemic medications must be carefully chosen to balance maternal benefit with fetal/neonatal safety; procedural interventions, when deemed life- or sight\u2010saving, are generally pursued with appropriate shielding and precautions. \u2022 Option A (Ipsilateral Horner): This finding is more characteristic of carotid dissection rather than an OA infarction. \n\u2022 Option B (Ipsilateral Hearing Loss): Sudden hearing loss is more typically seen with infarction of the labyrinthine artery (usually a branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery) rather than the ophthalmic artery. \n\u2022 Option C: Although the text is missing here, it is presumed that Option C was intended to describe the hallmark presentation of OA infarction (i.e., acute, painless monocular vision loss with retinal findings). \n\u2022 Option D: Not provided. 1. The retina is exquisitely sensitive to ischemia, and irreversible damage may occur within a short time window. \n2. Sudden monocular vision loss should prompt immediate evaluation for vascular occlusive disease. \n3. Always consider systemic vascular risk factors and embolic sources in patients with ocular ischemia. Recent studies and reviews have emphasized that early recognition and treatment of retinal arterial occlusions are crucial; however, no treatment modality (including thrombolysis) has consistently proven effective. Current guidelines remain focused on rapid risk factor assessment and secondary prevention rather than a standardized acute intervention, and research into hyperacute reperfusion strategies is ongoing.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with a posterior communicating (P-com or P-chom) artery aneurysm is a neurosurgical emergency. The primary goal is to prevent rebleeding by securing the aneurysm. Rupture of a P-com aneurysm leads to bleeding into the subarachnoid space, causing a sudden rise in intracranial pressure, meningeal irritation, and potential for vasospasm. The P-com aneurysm is one of the common sites for aneurysms and is intimate with the oculomotor nerve, which can lead to nerve palsies. Patients typically present with a sudden, severe (\u2018thunderclap\u2019) headache, often accompanied by neck stiffness, nausea/vomiting, and in some cases, focal neurological deficits such as third nerve palsy. Rapid identification and treatment are essential to reduce mortality and complications from rebleeding or vasospasm. Initial evaluation includes a non\u2010contrast CT scan to detect SAH, followed by vascular imaging such as CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to diagnose and precisely localize the aneurysm. Differential diagnoses include other causes of SAH such as perimesencephalic hemorrhage and arteriovenous malformations. The definitive management is to secure the aneurysm. Endovascular coiling is generally considered the first-line intervention when the aneurysm anatomy is favorable, particularly following large randomized trials (such as the ISAT) which demonstrated improved outcomes with coiling in appropriate cases. Surgical clipping remains an alternative when coiling is not feasible. In pregnant or lactating patients, the decision must balance maternal risk and fetal exposure to radiation and contrast agents; shielding and careful procedural planning can mitigate risks. \u2022 Option A (Endovascular coiling): Correct \u2013 It is considered first-line therapy for many ruptured aneurysms, including P-com aneurysms, when anatomy permits. \n\u2022 Option B (Surgical clipping): While a valid alternative, it is typically reserved for aneurysms not amenable to endovascular treatment. \n\u2022 Option C (Observation): Inappropriate in the context of a ruptured aneurysm due to the imminent risk of rebleeding. 1. In aneurysmal SAH, securing the aneurysm as early as possible greatly reduces the risk of rebleeding. \n2. P-com aneurysms can produce an acute third nerve palsy. \n3. The ISAT trial has significantly influenced the preference for endovascular management in suitable aneurysms. Current guidelines and recent evidence support endovascular coiling as a first\u2010line therapy for ruptured cerebral aneurysms when indicated by their size and shape. Ongoing research continues to refine criteria for selecting between clipping and coiling, with an emphasis on reducing complications and improving long-term outcomes.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Anterior choroidal artery infarction is a distinct type of ischemic stroke affecting the small branch of the internal carotid system. It has a characteristic clinical presentation that helps localize the lesion. Occlusion of the anterior choroidal artery results in ischemia of structures such as the posterior limb of the internal capsule, parts of the optic radiation, and the medial temporal lobe. The resulting infarct produces a combination of motor, sensory, and visual deficits. Patients with anterior choroidal artery infarction may show contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and specific visual field deficits (typically a homonymous hemianopia). The presence of a visual field defect that corresponds with the infarct territory supports the diagnosis. Diagnosis is made via neuroimaging studies \u2013 diffusion-weighted MRI is highly sensitive in the hyperacute setting, while CT scans can help in the early phase and rule out hemorrhage. Differential diagnoses include lacunar strokes from other small vessel occlusions and infarctions in the posterior cerebral artery territory. Management of an anterior choroidal artery infarct follows standard acute ischemic stroke protocols. If the patient presents within the thrombolytic window, IV thrombolysis may be indicated. Secondary prevention with antiplatelet agents, control of risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia), and rehabilitation are essential. In pregnant or lactating patients, thrombolytic use is carefully considered based on risk-benefit analysis, and antiplatelet therapy selection is guided by safety data in these populations. \u2022 Option A (Anterior choroidal artery infarction): Correct \u2013 the clinical vignette clearly supports this diagnosis. \n\u2022 Other options: Not provided, making Option A the only and thus the correct answer in context. 1. The classic triad of anterior choroidal artery infarction is contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and homonymous hemianopia. \n2. Diffusion-weighted MRI is the gold standard for early detection of small vessel strokes. \n3. Prompt recognition allows for timely intervention and secondary prevention. Recent studies reiterate the importance of early imaging and intervention in ischemic stroke. Guidelines continue to support thrombolysis for eligible patients with small vessel infarcts, and ongoing research focuses on neuroprotective strategies and long-term rehabilitation outcomes.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Acute stroke workup aims not only to rule out hemorrhage but also to evaluate the cerebral vasculature for occlusions or stenoses that may guide reperfusion strategies like thrombectomy. CTA (computed tomography angiography) is critical for visualizing the intracranial vessels. In the setting of an ischemic stroke, rapid imaging beyond a non-contrast CT is essential to assess vessel patency. CTA provides detailed images of both extracranial and intracranial arteries, identifying occlusions or significant stenoses that could be amenable to endovascular intervention. After initial stroke imaging (typically non-contrast CT to exclude hemorrhage), if the clinical picture supports an ischemic stroke and intervention is under consideration, CTA is the next step. It is especially indicated in patients who may benefit from mechanical thrombectomy and helps in differentiating large vessel occlusion strokes from smaller infarcts. The standard acute stroke imaging protocol begins with a non-contrast head CT followed by CTA to assess the cerebral vasculature. Differential imaging modalities such as MRA or carotid Doppler have more limited roles in the hyperacute phase. Carotid Doppler, for instance, evaluates mainly extracranial vessels, while MRI/MRA may not be rapidly available. Once CTA confirms large vessel occlusion or other vascular abnormalities, the treatment plan may include intravenous thrombolysis (if within the time window) followed by mechanical thrombectomy. In pregnancy or lactating patients, careful shielding is employed to reduce fetal radiation exposure; decisions are based on a risk-benefit assessment given the emergent nature of stroke. \u2022 Option A (CTA): Correct \u2013 It is the next appropriate step as it provides essential vascular information that complements non-contrast CT findings. \n\u2022 Other options (Non-contrast CT alone, carotid Doppler, MRI/MRA, cardiac evaluation): These are either limited in vascular evaluation or not immediately practical in the emergent setting and therefore do not replace CTA in acute stroke protocols. 1. CTA is indispensable in the acute stroke setting for identifying large vessel occlusions that might benefit from thrombectomy. \n2. Time is brain: rapid and accurate imaging directly influences acute management and outcomes. \n3. Integration of CTA findings with clinical assessment optimizes patient selection for reperfusion therapies. Recent guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) underscore the importance of CTA in acute stroke protocols. Research continues to refine imaging selection criteria to identify patients most likely to benefit from advanced endovascular therapies.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "The hyperdense basilar artery sign is a classic radiologic clue for basilar artery occlusion. In a patient with altered mental status and brainstem signs (e.g., decerebrate posturing), identifying a vascular occlusion is critical. CTA is recognized as the primary non\u2010invasive vascular imaging modality to evaluate suspected occlusions. Basilar artery occlusion is generally the result of thromboembolic disease. The hyperdense sign on noncontrast CT represents a clot within the artery, which leads to reduced or absent blood flow to brainstem structures. This occlusion results in ischemia of critical structures, leading to rapid neurologic deterioration, as evidenced by decreased level of consciousness and posturing abnormalities. Clinically, patients with basilar artery occlusion may present with symptoms ranging from visual disturbances and vertigo to coma and decerebrate posturing because of brainstem involvement. The acute neurologic deterioration observed in this case fits the profile of a posterior circulation stroke. After identifying the hyperdense sign on CT, the next step is to perform computed tomography angiography (CTA) to confirm the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses may include other causes of coma or brainstem dysfunction such as hemorrhage, encephalitis, or metabolic derangements; however, the imaging clue of a hyperdense artery specifically points to vascular occlusion. Once a basilar artery occlusion is confirmed on CTA, management may include intravenous thrombolysis if within the time window and mechanical thrombectomy. Early recanalization is critical for reducing morbidity and mortality. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of CTA is generally considered safe with appropriate shielding, and treatment decisions (such as IV thrombolysis) require a careful risk-benefit analysis balancing maternal and fetal risks. Option A (CTA) is correct because after seeing the hyperdense basilar sign, CTA is the appropriate next diagnostic step to determine the exact location and extent of the occlusion. Option B (EEG) is incorrect because EEG evaluates electrical brain activity and is not useful in diagnosing vascular occlusions. 1. The hyperdense basilar artery sign on noncontrast CT is an important early indicator of basilar occlusion. 2. CTA is the gold standard noninvasive imaging modality for confirming vascular occlusions in acute stroke settings. Recent stroke management guidelines emphasize the importance of rapid vascular imaging in suspected posterior circulation strokes. Studies have confirmed that early CTA allows for prompt decision-making regarding reperfusion therapies, which is critical in basilar occlusion cases.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In patients with a small thalamic hemorrhage, after 24 hours if the hemorrhage remains stable and there is no evidence of hydrocephalus or intraventricular extension, the major concern becomes the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is commonly used in this scenario. Small deep hemorrhages, such as those occurring in the thalamus, if not complicated by expansion or ventricular involvement, primarily pose a risk for secondary complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility. The prophylactic use of LMWH helps mitigate this risk while the hemorrhage is stable. The patient has a right thalamic hemorrhage that appears stable without hydrocephalus or ventricular extension on imaging. The stable nature of the hemorrhage makes it safe to initiate VTE prophylaxis, as the risk of bleeding expansion is minimized after the first 24 hours. Differential considerations include hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke, hypertensive hemorrhage, and vascular malformations. However, in the absence of hydrocephalus or ventricular extension, conservative management with VTE prophylaxis is most appropriate. Serial imaging may be done to monitor hematoma stability. After 24 hours of hemorrhage stability, initiating prophylactic LMWH for DVT prevention is recommended in current stroke guidelines. Blood pressure management and neurological monitoring remain essential. In pregnant patients, LMWH is favored over unfractionated heparin for VTE prophylaxis due to its better safety profile, and it is generally considered safe in lactation. Option A (Prophylactic LMWH) is correct and is supported by current guidelines for preventing thromboembolic complications in patients with stable intracerebral hemorrhage. Option B (EVD) is incorrect because external ventricular drainage is reserved for cases with significant hydrocephalus or intraventricular hemorrhage, which is not present in this case. 1. Prophylactic LMWH is indicated for DVT prevention in patients with stable small ICH after 24 hours. 2. EVD is not indicated unless there are signs of obstructive hydrocephalus or significant ventricular involvement. Recent clinical trials and guidelines (such as those from the American Heart Association) support the early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation with LMWH for patients with small, stable intracerebral hemorrhages, while carefully monitoring for any signs of hematoma expansion.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is a vascular malformation where an abnormal connection exists between a dural artery and a draining vein. It typically presents with progressive myelopathy and distinct MRI findings, including long segment T2 hyperintensity within the cord and flow voids representing abnormal vessels. In DAVF, the arterial blood shunts directly into the venous system, leading to increased venous pressure and congestion. This venous hypertension results in chronic spinal cord ischemia and demyelination, manifesting as progressive neurological deficits over time. Patients, often middle-aged males, present with progressive myelopathy characterized by symptoms such as gait disturbances and lower extremity weakness. The presence of flow voids (indicative of abnormal, dilated vessels) and longitudinal cord signal changes on MRI strongly point towards DAVF rather than inflammatory, demyelinating, or neoplastic processes. The differential diagnosis includes multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, spinal cord neoplasms, and infectious myelitis. Unlike these conditions, DAVF is suggested by the presence of flow voids on MRI and a gradual progression of myelopathy. Definitive diagnosis is usually confirmed with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which maps the vascular anatomy in detail. The first-line management for DAVF is endovascular embolization, which aims at occluding the fistula. Open surgical ligation is considered when embolization is not feasible or if the fistula recurs. In pregnant patients, the timing and modality of intervention require a careful multidisciplinary approach to balance maternal neurological recovery with fetal safety; similarly, lactating patients may need tailored anesthesia and procedural planning. Option A (DAVF) is correct because the clinical presentation of a progressive myelopathy combined with the specific MRI findings (slow flow voids and long cord signal abnormalities) strongly supports a diagnosis of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula. Other options such as multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, or neoplasm lack the combination of flow voids and progressive cord changes seen in DAVF. 1. Flow voids on spinal MRI are a key indicator of abnormal vascular channels typical of DAVF. 2. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent permanent neurological deficits. Current literature and updated neurovascular guidelines advocate for prompt diagnosis and early endovascular treatment of spinal DAVF to halt progression of myelopathy, with emerging evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of these interventions.",

    "explanation": "Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. This deficiency leads to systemic accumulation of glycosphingolipids, particularly globotriaosylceramide, affecting various organs including the kidneys, heart, nervous system, and skin. The lack of sufficient alpha-galactosidase A results in progressive deposition of glycosphingolipids within vascular endothelial cells and other tissues. The accumulation in blood vessels contributes to ischemic events such as stroke, while deposition in the skin leads to angiokeratoma formation. Renal impairment is also a common complication due to the buildup in the kidneys. The classic clinical triad of Fabry disease includes stroke (especially in younger males), renal dysfunction, and characteristic angiokeratomas. The presence of angiokeratomas, along with a history of renal impairment and stroke, strongly points toward Fabry disease as the underlying diagnosis. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by measuring alpha-galactosidase A enzyme activity in plasma or leukocytes, along with genetic testing for mutations in the GLA gene. Differential diagnoses include other lysosomal storage disorders such as Gaucher, Pompe, and Krabbe diseases which have distinct enzyme deficiencies and clinical presentations. The mainstay of Fabry disease treatment is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant alpha-galactosidase A. Early initiation of ERT can reduce glycosphingolipid deposition and ameliorate clinical symptoms. In pregnant women, the decision to initiate or continue ERT should involve a multidisciplinary team with careful risk-benefit analysis, as data are limited but suggest that treatment may be continued if clearly beneficial. Lactating patients should also receive tailored counseling regarding the safety profile of ERT during breastfeeding. Option A, which corresponds to enzyme replacement with alpha-galactosidase A (often noted as 'Galtcosidase'), is correct because this directly addresses the underlying deficiency in Fabry disease. Other enzymes mentioned (e.g., beta-glucocerebrosidase, alpha-glucosidase, or galactocerebrosidase) are associated with different lysosomal storage disorders and are therefore incorrect in this context. 1. Always consider Fabry disease in younger patients presenting with stroke, renal impairment, and characteristic skin lesions (angiokeratomas). 2. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant alpha-galactosidase A is the current disease-specific treatment for Fabry disease. Recent clinical studies and guideline updates continue to support the early use of ERT in Fabry disease to slow disease progression and improve outcomes. Ongoing research is looking into adjunctive therapies and optimal timing for initiating treatment, especially in special populations such as pregnant or lactating women.",

    "explanation": "Fabry disease is an X\u2010linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient activity of the enzyme \u03b1\u2010galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, particularly globotriaosylceramide, in various tissues including blood vessel walls, nerves, and skin. Due to a mutation in the GLA gene, the decreased activity of \u03b1\u2010galactosidase A results in the progressive deposition of globotriaosylceramide in endothelial cells, nerve cells, and other tissues. This accumulation causes vascular dysfunction, ischemia, and neuropathic pain. It also leads to characteristic skin lesions (angiokeratomas) and can predispose patients to early strokes. The 14\u2010year\u2010old boy presenting with intense, lancinating pain in the feet and decreased pain sensation, alongside his sister\u2019s milder symptoms and a maternal grandfather with premature stroke, is highly suggestive of Fabry disease. The presence of skin lesions further strengthens the diagnosis since angiokeratomas are a hallmark of the condition. The diagnostic workup involves measuring \u03b1\u2010galactosidase A activity in plasma or leukocytes. Differential diagnoses to consider include other neuropathies such as diabetic neuropathy or hereditary sensory neuropathies; however, the combination of neuropathic pain, characteristic angiokeratomas, and a family history of early cerebrovascular events is specific for Fabry disease.

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This case involves an ischemic stroke patient presenting 2 days after symptom onset with moderately elevated blood pressure. In ischemic strokes, especially when the patient is outside the thrombolytic time window, permissive hypertension is generally allowed to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion to the affected areas. During an ischemic stroke, the brain\u2019s autoregulatory mechanisms may cause blood pressure to rise in an effort to maintain blood flow to the ischemic penumbra. Aggressive blood pressure reduction in this phase can decrease cerebral perfusion, risking expansion of the infarct. Thus, in patients who are not candidates for thrombolysis, blood pressure is often left untreated unless it is extremely high. The patient presents with unilateral weakness and dysarthria, symptoms typical of a stroke, with blood pressure at 170/90 mmHg. Given that the stroke occurred 2 days ago and the blood pressure is not excessively high, the best approach is to continue supportive care with observation. While imaging (CT/MRI) is essential in stroke evaluation to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, in this scenario the management focus is on blood pressure. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic stroke, stroke mimics, and lacunar infarcts; however, in the subacute phase of ischemia management, aggressive BP control is not indicated unless BP is >220/120 when not undergoing thrombolysis. According to current AHA/ASA guidelines, in acute ischemic stroke patients not receiving thrombolysis, blood pressure should not be lowered aggressively unless it exceeds 220/120 mmHg. The tiered management involves supportive care, refraining from precipitous BP reduction, and monitoring. For women who are pregnant or lactating, similar principles apply with careful consideration of medication safety if any pharmacological intervention becomes necessary. Option A (IV labetalol) and Option B (IV nitroprusside) suggest active blood pressure reduction which is not required at a BP of 170/90 mmHg in this clinical setting. Option D (Resume home medications) does not address the acute scenario adequately. Option C (Observation) is correct as it aligns with the principle of permissive hypertension in ischemic stroke beyond the thrombolysis window. 1. Permissive hypertension is a cornerstone of acute ischemic stroke management when patients are not eligible for thrombolysis. 2. The thrombolytic window (typically 4.5 hours) is critical; after that, supportive care is emphasized. Recent guidelines continue to support a conservative approach to blood pressure management in non-thrombolysis ischemic stroke patients, emphasizing the risk of further ischemia with aggressive BP reductions.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In the acute management of stroke, neuroimaging is the cornerstone to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic etiologies. A prompt CT scan is critical in establishing the diagnosis and guiding subsequent interventions. Markedly elevated blood pressure, as seen with 220/120 mmHg, increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation and intracerebral bleeding. However, in the context of ischemic stroke, high blood pressure may be a compensatory mechanism to maintain perfusion to the penumbra. Knowing the stroke subtype through imaging is essential before any treatment decisions. This elderly male exhibits classic stroke symptoms (right-sided weakness and aphasia) with a high NIHSS score and severely elevated BP. The clinical severity and high blood pressure necessitate immediate imaging to exclude hemorrhage. Differential diagnosis includes acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and stroke mimics. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is the first-line diagnostic tool because it rapidly distinguishes hemorrhagic from ischemic stroke, which is critical for subsequent management decisions such as thrombolysis. Current guidelines recommend immediate CT imaging in suspected stroke cases. For patients with ischemic stroke and a history suggesting possible thrombolysis, blood pressure must be lowered to below 185/110 mmHg before IV thrombolysis can be initiated. However, the decision to control blood pressure comes after the imaging has confirmed the absence of hemorrhage. Option A (CT brain) is correct because it confirms the diagnosis and rules out hemorrhage. Option B (Control Blood pressure) is an important step but should be undertaken after imaging confirms the type of stroke and when considering thrombolytic therapy. Option C (IV thrombolysis) cannot be administered without diagnostic imaging and addressing the blood pressure issue first. 1. 'Time is brain' \u2013 rapid imaging with CT is essential in suspected stroke cases. 2. Blood pressure management in stroke is nuanced; it is lowered only if thrombolysis is pursued after confirming ischemia. Recent AHA/ASA updates reinforce the protocol of immediate CT imaging in acute stroke to guide timely treatment, especially in patients with elevated BP where the risk of hemorrhage is a concern.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are brief episodes of neurological dysfunction resulting from transient cerebral ischemia. Recurrent TIAs warrant further vascular investigation to identify any clinically significant vessel disease. Patients with ESRD on hemodialysis are at higher risk for vascular calcification and atherosclerotic changes. Additionally, hemodynamic fluctuations during dialysis can precipitate transient episodes of cerebral hypoperfusion, leading to TIAs. Carotid ultrasound may not fully evaluate intracranial vessels, hence additional imaging is required. This female patient experiences recurrent episodes of left-sided weakness and dysarthria during dialysis sessions. The presence of old ischemic changes on CT supports underlying cerebrovascular disease. While carotid ultrasound shows atherosclerotic changes without significant stenosis, the possibility of intracranial involvement or subtler vascular anomalies necessitates further evaluation. The differential diagnosis includes TIA due to embolic phenomena, hemodynamic instability causing global or watershed cerebral ischemia, and intracranial stenosis. CT angiography (CTA) is the non-invasive imaging modality of choice for evaluating both cervical and intracranial vasculature in this setting. For patients with TIA, the current guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy, risk factor modification, and prompt vascular imaging (such as CTA) to evaluate for stenosis or other vascular abnormalities. In ESRD patients, contrast use requires careful consideration, and alternative imaging strategies may be considered if there are concerns regarding contrast-induced nephropathy, though in dialysis patients this is generally less concerning. For pregnant or lactating patients, the use of contrast is approached with caution and benefits weighed against potential risks. Option A (CT angiography) is correct as it provides detailed visualization of the entire cerebrovascular tree, helping to identify lesions that may not be apparent on carotid ultrasound. Option B (MRI brain) is better for tissue characterization and detecting small infarcts but is less optimal for evaluating vascular anatomy in this context. Option C (CT Venogram) is not indicated as the clinical scenario does not suggest a venous pathology. 1. Recurrent TIAs are a red flag for impending stroke, necessitating comprehensive vascular evaluation. 2. In ESRD patients, hemodynamic shifts during dialysis can precipitate cerebral ischemia, making timely vascular imaging crucial. Recent studies underscore the utility of CT angiography in TIA workups, as it can swiftly detect both extracranial and intracranial vascular pathologies that might be missed by ultrasound alone.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune thrombophilic disorder that manifests with both arterial and venous thromboses and recurrent pregnancy losses. It represents one of the key causes of ischemic stroke in young to middle-aged women, especially when accompanied by a history of miscarriages. APS is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (such as anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein I) which lead to a hypercoagulable state. These antibodies disrupt normal coagulation processes, paradoxically prolonging clotting times in laboratory assays while predisposing patients to thrombosis. This explains the association with both elevated clotting times and thrombotic events. A female patient with an ischemic stroke, a history of recurrent miscarriages, and abnormal coagulation tests is highly suggestive of APS. The clinical picture differentiates APS from other thrombophilias, such as prothrombin gene mutation, which does not commonly present with recurrent abortions. The diagnostic workup for APS involves laboratory testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein I. For a definitive diagnosis, these tests need to be positive on two separate occasions at least 12 weeks apart. Differential diagnoses include other inherited thrombophilias (such as factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation), but the obstetric history specifically points toward APS. In patients diagnosed with APS, long-term anticoagulation (typically with warfarin aiming for an INR of 2.0-3.0) is recommended for secondary stroke prevention. During pregnancy, warfarin is contraindicated due to teratogenic effects; instead, a regimen of low molecular weight heparin and low-dose aspirin is used. These management strategies are supported even in lactating patients, with special considerations given to the safety profiles of the medications. Option A (Anti phospholipid syndrome testing) is correct because it directly addresses the suspected diagnosis given the patient\u2019s history of recurrent abortions and ischemic stroke. Option B (Prothrombin Gene Mutation) is less appropriate for this clinical picture, as this mutation is not typically associated with recurrent pregnancy losses. 1. APS should be considered in any young woman with thrombotic events and a history of miscarriages. 2. Laboratory testing for APS requires confirmation on two occasions to fulfill diagnostic criteria. Recent guidelines stress the importance of early APS detection through standardized antibody testing, and they advocate for aggressive, individualized anticoagulation management to reduce the risk of recurrent thrombotic events.",

    "explanation": "This question concerns a young woman with a subacute presentation of headache, blurred vision, and new\u2010onset seizure \u2013 a constellation that should raise suspicion for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT). The core concept is that CVT often presents with signs of raised intracranial pressure and seizures in a young patient (often women, sometimes with risk factors like OCP use or pregnancy), and the imaging choice should best visualize the venous system. CVT occurs when a thrombus occludes one or more of the cerebral venous sinuses. This results in impaired venous drainage, increased intracranial pressure, and potentially venous infarction or hemorrhagic conversion. The disruption of venous flow leads to leakage, edema, and sometimes localized seizures. Up\u2010to\u2010date research emphasizes early detection as prompt anticoagulation can minimize permanent damage. The patient\u2019s headache, blurred vision (often a sign of papilledema secondary to raised ICP), and seizure are typical clinical manifestations of CVT. Despite a normal neurological exam, the subacute nature of symptoms in a young woman without classic risk factors for arterial stroke shifts concern to a venous process. Common differentials include subarachnoid hemorrhage, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and even demyelinating lesions. However, CVT should be differentiated by using imaging modalities that visualize the venous sinuses. Although MRI brain (sometimes with MR venography) is highly sensitive, in acute settings CT venography is both rapid and effective. CT angiogram focuses on arteries and lumbar puncture can be contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure. Immediate management involves anticoagulation (typically with low molecular weight heparin), even in the presence of small hemorrhagic infarcts. According to current guidelines, supportive measures to reduce intracranial pressure and seizure control are also important. In pregnant or lactating patients, unfractionated heparin or LMWH remains the treatment of choice as they do not cross the placenta and are compatible with breastfeeding. Option A (MRI brain) is useful but may not adequately evaluate the venous system without specialized sequences (i.e., MR venography). Option B (CT angiogram) focuses on arterial rather than venous circulation. Option D (Lumbar puncture) can be dangerous in suspected increased ICP and does not diagnose CVT. Option C (CT venogram) is the best study to visualize the cerebral venous sinuses in an acute setting. 1. CVT should be suspected in young women with headaches, seizures, and visual changes even if the neurological exam is unremarkable. 2. CT venogram is a rapid, sensitive imaging modality for assessing the cerebral venous sinuses. 3. Early anticoagulation is critical even in the presence of hemorrhagic lesions. Recent studies and guidelines continue to support the use of CT venography as a first\u2010line diagnostic tool in suspected CVT. There is also an emphasis on early diagnosis and treatment with heparin anticoagulation, with adaptations made for special populations like pregnant and lactating women.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question addresses a known adverse effect of intravenous thrombolysis (t-PA) used for acute ischemic stroke \u2013 specifically, orolingual angioedema. The core concept is recognizing that t-PA can trigger angioedema, especially in patients taking ACE inhibitors. t-PA facilitates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which can lead to the activation of the kallikrein-kinin system and subsequent release of bradykinin. Bradykinin accumulation increases vascular permeability. In patients on ACE inhibitors, the degradation of bradykinin is reduced, further enhancing the risk of angioedema. The appearance of abnormal swelling around the mouth 20 minutes after initiation of IV t-PA in a patient with normal blood pressure is characteristic of orolingual angioedema. This reaction is often localized to the lips, tongue, or oropharyngeal tissues and can progress to airway compromise if not recognized and managed promptly. The diagnosis is clinical; one differentiates this condition from other allergic reactions by its rapid onset following t-PA administration and its predilection for the orolingual region. The history of ACE inhibitor use is a critical associated risk factor distinguishing it from other causes of allergic or angioedematous reactions. Immediate management involves addressing airway concerns followed by pharmacologic therapy. Guidelines suggest administering antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) and steroids, and if necessary, epinephrine. In patients with mild symptoms and stable airway, conservative management with antihistamines is indicated. It is also important to note that ACE inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy due to teratogenicity, and this adverse effect is an additional reason to avoid them in pregnant women. Option A (Frontal lobe stroke) is unrelated to the development of angioedema. The marked answer, Option B (ACE inhibitor), is correct because the use of ACE inhibitors predisposes patients to t-PA induced orolingual angioedema by impairing bradykinin breakdown. Other unspecified options do not pertain to the risk factors for this reaction. 1. t-PA-associated angioedema typically occurs within an hour of administration. 2. Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors significantly increases the risk of developing this adverse reaction. 3. Recognizing this complication early is essential to prevent airway compromise. Newer studies reinforce the association between ACE inhibitors and increased risk of orolingual angioedema with t-PA. Protocols now emphasize early identification and rapid management of this complication, especially in patients known to be taking ACE inhibitors.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In this scenario, the patient receiving IV t-PA for acute ischemic stroke develops orolingual angioedema shortly thereafter. The key concept is recognizing the complication and instituting appropriate management without unnecessarily interrupting stroke treatment unless airway compromise is imminent. IV t-PA can trigger the release of bradykinin through the activation of the kallikrein-kinin pathway. Elevated bradykinin levels increase vascular permeability, leading to angioedema. This is particularly common in patients on ACE inhibitors, where bradykinin degradation is impaired. The patient\u2019s development of swelling around the mouth\u2014an area highly susceptible to bradykinin effects\u2014despite normal blood pressure, points toward an angioedema reaction rather than a hypertensive bleed or other complication. The clinical picture is consistent with a localized, non-life-threatening adverse reaction that, if not progressing to airway compromise, can be managed medically. The diagnosis is clinical, based on the temporal relationship with t-PA infusion and examination of the orofacial region. Differential diagnoses include anaphylaxis from other agents; however, the presence of orolingual swelling without hypotension or diffuse skin involvement supports a localized reaction. The first step in management for patients with mild to moderate orolingual angioedema is to administer antihistamines such as diphenhydramine. Corticosteroids may also be used. Airway monitoring is essential, and while discontinuing t-PA may be considered in severe cases or if the airway is compromised, mild reactions can often be managed without stopping thrombolytic therapy. In cases of progression to airway compromise, immediate airway protection measures, including intubation, should be instituted. In pregnant or lactating women, diphenhydramine remains the first-line agent as it is considered relatively safe. Option A (Stop t-PA) might be considered if the angioedema were severe or causing airway compromise; however, in a stable patient with localized swelling, stopping t-PA is not immediately necessary. Option C (Immediate intubation) is reserved for patients with overt airway compromise. Option D (CT brain) is not indicated in this scenario. The marked answer, Option B (Diphenhydramine), is correct as it targets the allergic reaction and is the appropriate immediate management step for mild to moderate symptoms. 1. Orolingual angioedema following t-PA does not automatically warrant cessation of thrombolytic therapy if the airway remains secure. 2. Early intervention with antihistamines can arrest the progression of swelling. 3. Always monitor the airway closely, as angioedema can progress rapidly. Recent guidelines advocate for rapid assessment of airway compromise in t-PA-induced angioedema and recommend medical management with antihistamines and steroids before considering more invasive measures. Studies support that early intervention with agents like diphenhydramine can be effective in controlling mild reactions.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "The question differentiates the etiologies of vertigo by asking which feature helps distinguish a peripheral from a central cause. The core concept is that peripheral vertigo, often stemming from inner ear disorders such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or vestibular neuritis, tends to be elicited by specific head movements or positions. Peripheral vertigo arises from pathology in the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear. In conditions like BPPV, displaced otoliths trigger vertigo when the head is moved into certain positions. Conversely, central vertigo is due to lesions in the brainstem or cerebellum (often vascular or demyelinating), where symptoms are less typically tied to positional changes. Patients with peripheral vertigo often experience episodic vertigo that is reproducible with positional maneuvers (e.g., Dix-Hallpike test), and may also have associated tinnitus or hearing loss. In contrast, central vertigo may present with additional neurological signs (e.g., diplopia, dysarthria) and is less reliably elicited by maneuvers. When evaluating vertigo, differential diagnoses include peripheral causes such as BPPV, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, and vestibular neuritis, versus central causes such as cerebellar infarction, multiple sclerosis, or brainstem tumors. A detailed history and physical exam (including the head impulse test, positional testing, and evaluation for neurological deficits) help differentiate these conditions. Management of peripheral vertigo involves maneuvers such as the Epley or Semont maneuvers for BPPV, vestibular rehabilitation for other vestibular disorders, and symptomatic control with vestibular suppressants. In central vertigo, management is directed at the underlying cause (e.g., stroke management protocols). In pregnant or lactating patients, nonpharmacologic measures and repositioning maneuvers are preferred due to medication safety profiles. Option A (Severe nausea and vomiting) can occur in both peripheral and central vertigo and is not sufficiently discriminatory. The marked answer, Option B (Reproducible vertigo), is correct because in peripheral causes, vertigo can typically be reproduced with specific maneuvers (e.g., Dix-Hallpike), whereas central vertigo is less likely to be triggered reliably by positional changes. The other options were not provided, but among the choices given, reproducibility points toward a peripheral origin. 1. In peripheral vertigo, symptoms are often positional and can be reproduced with maneuvers, whereas central vertigo may present with additional focal neurological deficits. 2. The presence of auditory symptoms (tinnitus, hearing loss) alongside vertigo supports a peripheral cause. 3. A normal head impulse test favors a central etiology. Recent research reinforces that reproducible vertigo with positional changes is a hallmark of peripheral vestibular disorders. Moreover, guideline updates stress the importance of a focused neurological exam (including the HINTS exam) to rule out central causes, especially when the clinical picture is ambiguous.",
