    "explanation": "Intracranial stenosis of the MCA refers to a significant narrowing usually caused by atherosclerotic plaque, which predisposes patients to ischemic strokes. The core concept involves reducing the risk of thromboembolic events by stabilizing the atherosclerotic plaque and preventing platelet aggregation. Severe intracranial stenosis leads to turbulent blood flow and endothelial injury, which can trigger platelet activation and thrombus formation. The SAMMPRIS trial provided evidence that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel reduces recurrent stroke risk by inhibiting platelet aggregation in these patients. Patients with severe MCA stenosis may present with transient ischemic attacks or stroke symptoms corresponding to the MCA territory (e.g., contralateral weakness, speech disturbances). The risk of recurrent events is high unless effective antithrombotic strategies are implemented. Diagnosis typically involves non-invasive imaging such as CT/MRI to exclude infarcted tissue or hemorrhage, followed by vascular studies (MRA, CTA, or digital subtraction angiography) to assess the severity of stenosis. Differential diagnoses include dissection, vasculitis, and moyamoya disease, which are differentiated based on clinical history, imaging characteristics, and additional laboratory tests. Current guidelines based on the SAMMPRIS trial recommend initiating DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 90 days in patients with symptomatic severe intracranial stenosis. Risk factor modification, statin therapy, and lifestyle changes are also integral. For pregnant women, low-dose aspirin is typically considered safe, and while data on clopidogrel is limited, it may be used if the benefits outweigh the risks. Endovascular interventions remain a secondary option reserved for patients who fail medical therapy. Option A (DAPT) is correct because it directly targets the pathophysiology of platelet activation and subsequent thrombus formation in severe stenosis. Alternative options such as single antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, or immediate endovascular intervention are less suitable based on current evidence, which emphasizes the efficacy of DAPT. The marked answer (B) is incorrect because the evidence supports DAPT as the initial management strategy. 1. DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel is supported by evidence for reducing recurrent stroke in severe intracranial stenosis. 2. Early intensive medical management is often more beneficial than immediate invasive procedures. 3. Always assess and modify vascular risk factors concurrently. The SAMMPRIS trial remains a cornerstone in the management of intracranial atherosclerotic disease, demonstrating that aggressive medical management with DAPT is superior to stenting in preventing recurrent strokes. Recent updates continue to support this approach, emphasizing individualized risk factor management and the potential role of newer antiplatelet agents.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In patients with a minor stroke (NIHSS 3) who are within the thrombolytic window, the primary goal is to rapidly restore cerebral perfusion. Although the symptoms might be mild, if they are potentially disabling, acute reperfusion therapy is warranted. Ischemic stroke results from an occlusive thrombus that obstructs blood flow. Intravenous tPA facilitates clot dissolution (thrombolysis), thereby restoring blood flow and reducing the infarct size. Even minor strokes, if affecting eloquent areas, can have a significant impact on quality of life. A patient presenting with decreased sensation and mild facial weakness, even with a low NIHSS score, may have deficits that are considered disabling if they impair daily activities. The timely administration of tPA can improve functional outcomes if given within the 4.5-hour therapeutic window. Evaluation begins with a non-contrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage, followed by assessment of eligibility for thrombolytic therapy. Stroke mimics (migraine, seizure, hypoglycemia) should be considered but can typically be excluded based on clinical evaluation and imaging. First-line management for eligible patients within the 4.5-hour window is intravenous thrombolysis (tPA). DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel) is recommended for secondary prevention but does not provide acute reperfusion. In pregnant patients, the use of tPA requires careful evaluation of risks versus benefits, though current literature suggests that, when indicated, tPA may be used in pregnancy on a case-by-case basis. In lactating women, tPA is generally considered safe because minimal transfer occurs into breast milk. Option A (DAPT) is not the appropriate acute treatment because it does not address the clot directly as required in reperfusion strategies. Option B (tPA) is correct because it actively dissolves the clot and has been shown to improve outcomes in acute ischemic stroke. Option C (Aspirin alone) only serves a role in secondary prevention and lacks the efficacy in restoring perfusion during the acute phase. 1. Even minor strokes with disabling features warrant consideration for tPA if within the treatment window. 2. Quick imaging to differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic events is critical before initiating thrombolysis. 3. Time is brain \u2013 the earlier the treatment, the better the potential outcome. Recent guidelines and trials, including those reflected in the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommendations, support the use of tPA for mild but disabling stroke symptoms in eligible patients. Ongoing research continues to refine patient selection for thrombolytic therapy, especially in cases presenting with low NIHSS scores.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Atrial flutter, similar to atrial fibrillation, predisposes patients to thrombus formation in the atria, which can embolize and cause transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes. The use of Factor Xa inhibitors is aimed at reducing this embolic risk. In atrial flutter, the organized but rapid atrial contractions lead to stasis in the atria, especially in the left atrial appendage. This stasis promotes clot formation. Factor Xa inhibitors, such as apixaban or rivaroxaban, block a key step in the coagulation cascade (the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin), thereby reducing clot formation and subsequent embolic events. Patients with atrial flutter can present with TIAs or embolic strokes even when structural heart evaluations (like an echocardiogram) are normal. This underscores the need for appropriate anticoagulation rather than just symptomatic management. Diagnosis involves ECG to document atrial flutter, and often an echocardiogram to assess cardiac structure and function. Differential diagnoses include atrial fibrillation and other causes of cardioembolic stroke, such as valvular heart disease, which are differentiated based on the rhythm and imaging findings. Current guidelines recommend the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including Factor Xa inhibitors, for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. In pregnancy, however, the use of Factor Xa inhibitors is generally avoided due to limited safety data; low-molecular-weight heparin is preferred. In lactating women, caution is advised, but many DOACs may be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks. Option A (Factor Xa inhibitor) is correct because these agents have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of embolic events in patients with atrial flutter. Other options such as antiplatelet therapy or rate control alone do not adequately reduce the thromboembolic risk associated with this arrhythmia. 1. Always consider the cardioembolic source in TIA when atrial flutter is present. 2. DOACs are preferred over vitamin K antagonists for non-valvular atrial arrhythmias in most patients due to their improved safety profile and ease of management. 3. Tailor anticoagulation strategies in pregnant or lactating patients carefully. Recent trials and updated guidelines continue to support the use of DOACs, including Factor Xa inhibitors, for stroke prevention in patients with atrial flutter/fibrillation. Ongoing studies are refining their risk-benefit profiles in special populations, including the elderly and those with co-morbid conditions.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In acute ischemic stroke management, timely reperfusion therapy is critical. Intravenous thrombolysis (tPA) is indicated for patients presenting within 4.5 hours from symptom onset, provided there are no contraindications. Blood pressure management is an important precursor, but aggressive lowering is only necessary if the BP exceeds treatment thresholds. Acute stroke results from an occlusive thrombus leading to cerebral ischemia. tPA works by enzymatically breaking down the clot and restoring blood flow. Elevated blood pressure is a common physiologic response in acute ischemia, and excessive lowering may compromise perfusion in the penumbra. An 82-year-old female with an NIHSS of 20 and blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg is a candidate for tPA as her blood pressure is below the critical threshold of 185/110 mmHg. The CT scan, though showing subtle early ischemic changes, is not contraindicating thrombolysis. The primary goal is rapid reperfusion to salvage viable brain tissue. The diagnostic process involves CT imaging to exclude hemorrhage and confirm early ischemic changes, and vascular studies if large vessel occlusion is suspected. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic stroke and stroke mimics, but the clinical scenario and imaging findings support ischemic stroke. First-line management for eligible acute ischemic stroke patients is intravenous thrombolysis with tPA. Blood pressure should be managed only if it exceeds 185/110 mmHg. In this case, since the BP is 180/100 mmHg, withholding BP lowering medications (like labetalol) is crucial to maintain cerebral perfusion. Mechanical thrombectomy is reserved for patients with confirmed large vessel occlusion. In pregnancy, tPA may be administered when the benefit outweighs potential risks, while in lactation, tPA is generally considered safe with minimal excretion in breast milk. Option A (Labetalol) is incorrect because the patient\u2019s BP is below the threshold that necessitates acute lowering prior to thrombolysis; unnecessary BP reduction may compromise cerebral perfusion. Option B (Thrombolysis) is correct as the patient is within the 4.5-hour window, with BP acceptable for tPA administration and imaging consistent with ischemia. Option C (Thrombectomy) is not immediately indicated without further vascular imaging confirming a large vessel occlusion. 1. Do not lower blood pressure aggressively in acute ischemic stroke if it is below 185/110 mmHg prior to tPA. 2. tPA administration within the therapeutic window significantly improves outcomes even in elderly patients. 3. Early imaging and rapid clinical assessment are key to determining eligibility for reperfusion therapy. Current guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association emphasize that patients with BP below 185/110 mmHg and within the 4.5-hour window should receive tPA. Recent studies continue to validate the safety and efficacy of thrombolysis in carefully selected elderly patients, reaffirming its role as the first-line therapy in acute ischemic stroke.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Malignant MCA infarction refers to a massive cerebral infarct in the middle cerebral artery territory that leads to severe cerebral edema and raised intracranial pressure. The central concept is that timely reduction of intracranial pressure through surgical means, specifically decompressive hemicraniectomy, can improve survival and functional outcomes. An occlusion of the MCA results in a large territory of brain tissue dying. This necrosis triggers both cytotoxic and vasogenic edema, which leads to a rapid rise in intracranial pressure and risk of herniation. Decompressive hemicraniectomy removes a part of the skull, allowing the swollen brain to expand and thus reducing the pressure on critical structures. Clinically, these patients may present with decreased consciousness, signs of increased intracranial pressure (such as pupillary changes), and a risk for imminent brain herniation. Without intervention, the natural history is poor, with high mortality and morbidity. Diagnosis is confirmed with neuroimaging (CT/MRI), which will demonstrate a large infarct with significant edema and mass effect. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic stroke, large territorial infarction with hemorrhagic transformation, and brain abscess. However, the imaging and clinical context of an acute malignant stroke help differentiate these conditions. First-line management for patients with malignant MCA infarction in eligible populations (typically younger than 60 but individualized) is decompressive hemicraniectomy, optimally performed within 48 hours of stroke onset. Supportive treatment includes intensive care monitoring, osmotherapy, and maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion. In pregnant patients, surgical interventions are approached with careful multidisciplinary planning to balance maternal benefits with fetal safety. Non-surgical interventions like hyperventilation are only temporizing measures and insufficient as definitive management. Option A (Decompressive hemicraniectomy) is correct because it directly addresses the mass effect and intracranial hypertension, altering the course of the disease. Option B (Stroke admission) is vital for supportive care but does not reverse the mass effect. Option C (Hyperventilation) only provides transient reduction of ICP and may risk ischemia without improving long\u2010term outcomes. 1. Early surgical intervention (within 48 hours) is crucial in malignant MCA infarction. 2. Non-surgical measures are supportive but do not change the natural history. 3. Decompressive hemicraniectomy has been shown in trials (e.g., DESTINY, HAMLET) to improve survival. Recent randomized controlled trials, including DESTINY and HAMLET, support the use of decompressive hemicraniectomy in appropriately selected patients with malignant MCA infarction, and current guidelines recommend timely surgical evaluation to improve survival and functional outcomes.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "tPA-induced angioedema is a known complication of thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke. It typically manifests as localized swelling, most often involving the tongue or oropharyngeal structures, due to a bradykinin-mediated reaction. tPA catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which, besides breaking down clots, can increase bradykinin levels. Elevated bradykinin increases vascular permeability leading to angioedema. This reaction is usually localized and can be particularly concerning if it progresses to airway compromise. In this scenario, the patient exhibits tongue angioedema with dysarthria but remains stable, with no signs of respiratory distress or imminent airway obstruction. Recognizing the early signs of angioedema is important to prevent potential progression to life-threatening airway compromise. The diagnosis is predominantly clinical, based on the temporal association with tPA administration and the appearance of tongue swelling. Differential diagnoses include ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema and allergic reactions to other medications. Airway assessment is paramount, with tools such as fiberoptic laryngoscopy used if needed. First-line treatment for tPA-induced angioedema in a stable patient is the prompt administration of steroids combined with antihistamines. These agents work to reduce inflammation and limit the further progression of edema. Intubation is reserved for cases with clear evidence of airway compromise. For pregnant or lactating patients, low-dose steroids and certain antihistamines (those with a good safety profile) can be utilized, prioritizing airway security as the paramount concern. Option A (Intubation) is incorrect in this context because the patient does not demonstrate active airway compromise. Option B (Steroid with antihistamine) is the appropriate first-line treatment to address the inflammatory and bradykinin-mediated components. Option C (ACE inhibitor with diuretics) is contraindicated because ACE inhibitors can exacerbate angioedema. 1. tPA-induced angioedema is often self-limited but requires close monitoring due to the risk of airway compromise. 2. Early administration of steroids and antihistamines can prevent further progression. 3. Airway management should be escalated only if there is evidence of respiratory distress. Recent studies and updated guidelines emphasize vigilant monitoring following tPA administration. Although the precise protocols may vary, the combination of steroids and antihistamines remains the cornerstone of management for tPA-induced angioedema in non-compromised patients.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "A ruptured aneurysm, specifically in the posterior communicating artery (PcOM), is a neurosurgical emergency that typically presents as a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The key management goal is to secure the aneurysm promptly to prevent rebleeding. The rupture of an aneurysm leads to bleeding into the subarachnoid space, resulting in a sudden increase in intracranial pressure, irritation of the meninges, and potential vasospasm. Failure to secure the aneurysm places the patient at high risk for rebleeding, one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Patients with aneurysmal rupture often present with a sudden, severe headache (sometimes described as 'thunderclap headache'), neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Early intervention is crucial to stabilize the patient and prevent complications. Diagnosis is typically made with a non-contrast head CT followed by CT angiography or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to localize and characterize the aneurysm. Differential diagnoses include traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and perimesencephalic hemorrhage, which are differentiated based on imaging appearance and clinical history. Endovascular coiling is generally preferred in many centers for treating ruptured aneurysms due to its less invasive nature and lower perioperative morbidity, provided the aneurysm\u2019s morphology is favorable. Microsurgical clipping remains an option when coiling is not feasible. In pregnant patients, endovascular procedures are performed with enhanced precautions to minimize fetal radiation exposure (using shielding and limiting contrast volume). Options like decompressive craniotomy or simple stroke unit admission are not definitive treatments for aneurysm rupture. Option A (Clipping) is a viable alternative but is more invasive compared to coiling. Option B (Coiling) is correct as it represents the preferred endovascular method in many cases for securing the aneurysm. Option C (Decompressive craniotomy) does not address the source of bleeding. Option D (Admission to a stroke unit) is supportive care but not a definitive treatment. 1. Securing the aneurysm\u2014either via coiling or clipping\u2014is essential to prevent rebleeding. 2. Endovascular coiling is often preferred in anatomically favorable aneurysms. 3. Rapid identification and management are key to improving outcomes in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Data from studies such as the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) have demonstrated favorable outcomes with endovascular coiling compared to clipping in suitable patients. Current neurosurgical guidelines increasingly favor coiling as the first-line treatment in many cases of aneurysmal rupture.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are brief episodes of neurologic dysfunction caused by temporary cerebral ischemia. Risk stratification using tools like the ABCD2 score is essential to identify patients at higher risk for subsequent strokes and to guide antiplatelet therapy. TIAs occur when there is a temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain, leading to transient neurological deficits without infarction on imaging. Patients with vascular risk factors\u2014such as diabetes, hypertension, and older age\u2014are at increased risk of repeated events due to underlying atherosclerotic disease. This 60-year-old male with diabetes and hypertension has experienced a TIA characterized by brief episodes of numbness and dysarthria. The presence of residual symptoms (persistent numbness) alongside a moderate NIHSS score (3) suggests an elevated risk for recurrent stroke, necessitating aggressive secondary prevention. Evaluation involves a thorough neurological exam supplemented by neuroimaging (CT/MRI) to rule out established infarction, as well as vascular imaging (carotid ultrasound, CT or MR angiography) to assess for significant stenosis. Differential diagnoses include seizure-related deficits, hypoglycemia, and migraine with aura. Current guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), typically with aspirin plus clopidogrel, for high-risk TIA patients or those with minor strokes (usually for 21-90 days) to reduce the risk of subsequent stroke. After this short-term period, patients are generally transitioned to single antiplatelet therapy. In pregnant or lactating patients, low-dose aspirin is generally considered safe, but clopidogrel requires careful risk-benefit analysis due to limited data. Option A (Aspirin alone) may offer some protection but is less effective than dual therapy in high-risk individuals. Option B (Clopidogrel alone) is not favored as monotherapy compared to the synergistic effect of dual therapy. Option C (Dual antiplatelet therapy) is correct as it has been shown to reduce early recurrent cerebrovascular events in patients with high-risk TIA, as supported by the CHANCE and POINT trials. 1. A high ABCD2 score in TIA patients indicates a significantly increased risk of stroke. 2. Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for a limited duration in high-risk TIA patients to reduce recurrence. 3. Early identification and intervention in TIA can significantly alter stroke outcomes. Recent clinical trials (CHANCE, POINT) have demonstrated that short-term dual antiplatelet therapy significantly reduces the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with high-risk TIA or minor stroke. Current guidelines advocate using DAPT for a short duration (21-90 days) before transitioning to monotherapy to balance efficacy with bleeding risks.",

    "explanation": "Anterior choroidal artery infarction is a specific type of ischemic stroke involving the small artery that supplies portions of the internal capsule, optic tract, lateral geniculate body, and other deep brain structures. Clinically, it is characterized by a triad including contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and a visual field defect (often a homonymous hemianopia), making the diagnosis suggestion clear when these features are present. Occlusion of the anterior choroidal artery leads to ischemic damage in its vascular territory.

This infarction is often thromboembolic in nature, related either to atherosclerotic disease or cardioembolic events. Patients with anterior choroidal artery stroke often present acutely with neurological deficits that include weakness and numbness on the contralateral side as well as a visual field defect corresponding to the loss of visual information processing in the affected optical pathway. The presence of visual field findings in tandem with motor/sensory deficits strongly supports the diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on a combined assessment of clinical presentation and neuroimaging (CT, MRI, and angiography). Differential diagnoses include other vascular territories such as middle cerebral artery or posterior cerebral artery infarctions, as well as lacunar strokes; however, the classic combination seen in anterior choroidal strokes helps in distinguishing it. A focused neurological exam assessing motor strength, sensory function, and visual fields is critical in directing imaging studies for confirmation. Acute management involves assessing eligibility for reperfusion therapies such as intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment if within the therapeutic window. Subsequent management includes antiplatelet therapy and secondary prevention strategies (including risk factor management such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia control). For pregnant or lactating patients, treatment choices require special considerations: low-dose aspirin is generally acceptable during pregnancy, and thrombolytic therapy may be considered when potential benefits outweigh risks after consultation with multidisciplinary teams. Individualized risk\u2013benefit analysis is crucial in these populations. In the presented MCQ, Option A ('anterior choroidal artery infarction') is the appropriate answer because the clinical scenario, which includes a visual field defect along with associated neurological deficits, matches the typical presentation of an infarction in the anterior choroidal artery territory. Although the other options are not listed, the information given solidly supports Option A. Recognize the classic triad of deficits (motor, sensory, and visual) in anterior choroidal strokes. Immediate neuroimaging is essential to confirm the diagnosis, and early reperfusion can significantly improve outcomes. In special populations such as pregnant or lactating patients, adapt standard stroke management protocols with extra care regarding medication safety. Recent guidelines and studies continue to support the early use of reperfusion therapy in acute ischemic stroke, including those with anterior choroidal involvement. Updated protocols emphasize rapid diagnosis and tailored management, especially for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, where low-dose aspirin and careful consideration of thrombolytic therapy are supported by current evidence.",

    "explanation": "This case describes an acute ischemic stroke evidenced by a new left occipital lesion on CT scan, with a presentation that is sudden and within the thrombolytic time window (approximately 1 hour). The rationale for administering IV tPA is based on the principle that early reperfusion therapy can salvage ischemic but still viable brain tissue, thereby improving outcomes. Acute ischemic stroke is caused by occlusion of a cerebral artery\u2014in this scenario, likely a branch supplying the occipital lobe. This occlusion leads to a cessation of blood flow, resulting in energy failure, neuronal injury, and infarction in the affected area. tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) works by enzymatically breaking down the fibrin clot, restoring perfusion to the penumbral area surrounding the infarct core. Visual hallucinations (e.g., seeing animals) can occur with occipital lobe involvement. The subsequent loss of consciousness could be related to the evolution of the stroke or secondary complications. Since the patient is intubated, airway protection has been addressed, enabling the safe administration of thrombolytic therapy. Initial evaluation with a non-contrast CT scan is critical to exclude hemorrhage in patients suspected of having a stroke. Once an acute ischemic stroke is confirmed and no contraindications are present, especially within the therapeutic window, IV tPA is indicated. Advanced imaging such as CTA is reserved for cases where vascular occlusion details are required, often in the context of considering mechanical thrombectomy. According to current guidelines (AHA/ASA), IV tPA is recommended for patients with acute ischemic stroke who present within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset, provided there are no contraindications. Since the patient presented within 1 hour and imaging confirmed an ischemic stroke with no evidence of hemorrhage, IV tPA is indicated. In pregnant or lactating patients, tPA is not contraindicated when the benefits outweigh the potential risks; multidisciplinary consultation is advised to guide therapy. Option A (CTA) is used for vascular imaging but is not mandatory when the diagnosis of ischemia is already established and the patient is within the therapeutic window. Option B (EEG) would only be relevant if a seizure were the primary concern. Option C (TPA) is the appropriate intervention given the acute ischemic findings within the necessary time frame. Option D is absent and does not contribute to management decision-making in this scenario. \u2022 Rapid assessment and imaging are crucial in stroke management \u2013 'time is brain.'\n\u2022 A non-contrast CT scan is the first-line investigation to rule out hemorrhage before thrombolysis.\n\u2022 IV tPA should be administered as soon as possible in eligible patients to optimize neurological outcomes.\n\u2022 In special populations such as pregnant or lactating patients, tPA can be considered after balancing potential risks and benefits. Recent clinical trials and guidelines from the AHA/ASA have reinforced that the benefits of timely IV tPA in acute ischemic stroke extend even more when administered early. Consensus supports its use in patients with confirmed ischemic stroke within the therapeutic window. Although data on tPA use in pregnancy is limited, case reports and expert recommendations suggest that it can be safely administered when clearly indicated, with appropriate monitoring and multidisciplinary management.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Stroke management is highly time\u2010sensitive. For acute ischemic stroke, the decision to administer treatments like tPA depends on the time since onset, with a narrow window (typically within 3-4.5 hours). In patients presenting outside this window, as in this case (last seen normal one day ago), the best management is supportive care in a stroke unit. Acute ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion leading to brain tissue ischemia and infarction. The cascade of excitotoxicity, inflammation, and eventual cell death occurs over hours. When the patient is found with decreased consciousness long after the onset, the infarct may be well established and not amenable to reperfusion therapies. A 56-year-old with decreased level of consciousness and a delayed presentation is unlikely to benefit from thrombolytics since the window for maximum efficacy has closed. Admission to a stroke unit allows for monitoring of complications such as edema, hemorrhagic transformation, and management of secondary stroke prevention. Imaging studies (typically a non-contrast CT scan) are used to differentiate hemorrhagic from ischemic stroke. Differential diagnoses include intracerebral hemorrhage, stroke mimics (e.g., seizure postictal state, hypoglycemia), and other causes of altered mental status. The timing (last known well time) is crucial in guiding the therapeutic approach. Since the patient is outside the thrombolytic window, first-line management involves supportive care: admission to a specialized stroke unit where multidisciplinary care improves outcomes. Secondary prevention with antiplatelet agents, statins, and risk factor modification is initiated. In pregnancy and lactation, while tPA may be used in selected cases within the window, in patients beyond the window, supportive care in a stroke unit remains standard and is safe. Option A (tPA) is incorrect because the therapeutic window has elapsed. Option B (admission to a stroke unit) is the correct answer as it aligns with current guidelines in managing patients with established stroke outside the tPA window. Options C and D are not provided or applicable. 1. Always ascertain the 'last known well' time to determine eligibility for thrombolysis. 2. Stroke units have been shown to significantly improve functional outcomes in stroke patients. Recent AHA/ASA guidelines reinforce the importance of dedicated stroke unit care for all patients with acute ischemic stroke, particularly when reperfusion therapy is not an option. Studies continue to validate improved outcomes with organized multidisciplinary care.",

    "explanation": "Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by sudden, severe ('thunderclap') headaches and reversible narrowing of cerebral arteries. The syndrome is often triggered by vasoactive substances or physical stressors. RCVS involves transient dysregulation of cerebral arterial tone, leading to multifocal, segmental vasoconstriction. The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but sympathetic overactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and hormonal influences (especially postpartum) are implicated. Patients with RCVS typically present with thunderclap headaches, which can recur over days to weeks. Neurological deficits may occur if the vasoconstriction leads to ischemia. Unlike other vasculopathies, RCVS is self-limited and reversible over time. Diagnosis is primarily radiological. CTA, MRA, or digital subtraction angiography may reveal a 'string-of-beads' appearance of alternating constricted and dilated segments. Differential diagnoses include primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), subarachnoid hemorrhage, and migraine variants; PACNS tends to have a more insidious onset and is not self-limited. First-line management includes supportive care and calcium channel blockers (e.g., nimodipine) to alleviate vasospasm. Avoiding triggers and symptomatic management are important. In pregnancy and lactation, management is similar; calcium channel blockers can be used with careful monitoring, and supportive measures remain the mainstay. Although the provided options are incomplete, Option A (Low glucose) is not a recognized feature of RCVS. Marked Answer B is presumed to describe the classic angiographic finding (multifocal segmental vasoconstriction or 'string-of-beads' appearance), which is correct. Other unlisted options likely do not match the hallmark features of RCVS. 1. RCVS is a reversible condition and often self-limited over weeks. 2. Thunderclap headache is the hallmark, and angiographic studies reveal multi-segmental vasoconstriction. Recent studies underscore the utility of calcium channel blockers in RCVS management and stress the importance of differentiating RCVS from conditions like PACNS.

    "explanation": "The Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA) supplies parts of the lateral midbrain and cerebellum. Lesions in this territory can affect adjacent neural structures, including the descending sympathetic fibers responsible for ocular sympathetic innervation. An infarct in the SCA territory may extend into the lateral midbrain where sympathetic fibers run. Interruption of these fibers can produce ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, characterized by ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. Patients with SCA strokes may present with a constellation of symptoms including ataxia, vertigo, and sometimes cranial nerve deficits. The presence of ipsilateral Horner's syndrome is an important clue localizing the lesion to regions where the sympathetic pathway is affected. Diagnosis is achieved via neuroimaging (CT or MRI) showing infarction in the SCA territory. Differential diagnoses include lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome and other brainstem strokes. The demonstration of ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, without involvement of the trochlear nerve (as seen in 4th nerve palsy), helps solidify the diagnosis. Management follows standard ischemic stroke protocols. First-line treatment includes supportive care in a stroke unit, antiplatelet therapy, and risk factor modification. In selected cases within the appropriate time window, reperfusion therapy may be considered. In pregnancy and lactation, treatment modalities including antiplatelet therapy are used with appropriate risk-benefit discussions. Secondary prevention is emphasized. Option A (Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome) is correct as it reflects the involvement of the descending sympathetic fibers in the lateral midbrain due to SCA infarct. Option B (4th cranial nerve palsy) is incorrect as the trochlear nerve is usually spared in SCA territory strokes, making it an uncommon presentation. 1. Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome is a key localizing sign in lateral midbrain and SCA infarcts. 2. Careful neurological examination can differentiate between various brainstem syndromes based on specific deficits. Recent research emphasizes the importance of recognizing subtle signs such as Horner's syndrome in posterior circulation strokes.

    "explanation": "Broca's aphasia is characterized by non-fluent, effortful speech with impaired repetition and naming but relatively preserved comprehension. The lesions are typically localized to the left inferior frontal gyrus in the dominant hemisphere, an area within the frontal perisylvian region. An ischemic stroke affecting Broca\u2019s area results in disruption of the neural circuits involved in speech production. Despite the damage, receptive language areas (such as Wernicke's area) remain intact, preserving comprehension. Patients present with right-sided weakness (often due to proximity of motor fibers in the dominant hemisphere) and expressive language deficits. The specific pattern of impaired fluency, repetition, and naming in the setting of intact comprehension makes the diagnosis of Broca's aphasia clear. Clinical bedside language assessments coupled with neuroimaging (MRI/CT) help confirm the localization. Differential diagnoses include conduction aphasia (characterized by impaired repetition but with relatively fluent speech) and global aphasia (which has both expressive and receptive deficits). Acute management involves standard stroke care with possible reperfusion therapy if within the time window. Long-term management centers on early speech and language therapy. For pregnant or lactating patients, standard stroke management and rehabilitation measures are used, with particular care to avoid teratogenic medications. Option A (Supramarginal Gyrus) is typically associated with conduction aphasia and is less likely to cause the non-fluent speech seen in Broca\u2019s aphasia. Option B (Frontal Perisylvian) is correct as it encompasses Broca\u2019s area.

    "explanation": "The visual cortex in the occipital lobe receives its blood supply primarily from the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). In patients presenting with visual field defects\u2014such as contralateral homonymous hemianopia with potential macular sparing\u2014the involvement of the PCA is highly suspect. Although the options list includes arteries like the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) and the basilar artery, the artery directly linked to primary visual processing is the PCA. Occlusion of the PCA, whether due to embolism, thrombosis, or other cerebrovascular events, leads to ischemia in the occipital cortex. This ischemia disrupts the function of the primary visual cortex, resulting in characteristic visual deficits. Recent evidence emphasizes that timely identification and reperfusion (when indicated) can limit the extent of neural damage. Clinically, a stroke in the PCA territory typically presents with contralateral visual field deficits (e.g., homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing). Patients may or may not have additional symptoms depending on the involvement of adjacent structures, but the hallmark is the visual defect. Imaging studies such as CT scans (initially) followed by MRI (to better delineate the affected area) are crucial. CT angiography or MR angiography can help identify an occlusion in the PCA. Differential diagnoses include occipital lobe lesions from other causes (hemorrhage, tumor) but the vascular pattern in stroke remains distinct. The management of an acute PCA stroke involves rapid evaluation for thrombolytic therapy (if within the therapeutic window), supportive care, and secondary prevention with antiplatelets and control of risk factors. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of thrombolytics is carefully considered following current guidelines, weighing maternal benefit against potential fetal risk. Blood pressure and glucose control, as well as early rehabilitation, form integral parts of management. Option A (SCA) primarily supplies portions of the cerebellum and midbrain; Option B (Basilar artery) mainly supplies the brainstem and parts of the cerebellum; Option C is presumed to represent the Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) and is correct; Option D is blank. Thus, the marked answer (C) is correct. 1. PCA strokes classically cause contralateral homonymous hemianopia with possible macular sparing. 2. Rapid recognition and imaging are critical in stroke management. 3. Timely intervention with thrombolytic therapy (when indicated) can improve outcomes. Recent AHA/ASA guidelines stress the importance of rapid imaging and intervention in acute ischemic strokes.

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Sickle cell anemia is characterized by the abnormal deformation of red blood cells under stress. This predisposes patients to vaso-occlusive crises, which can manifest in various organs, including the brain. In the context of stroke, various triggers can provoke sickling and endothelial injury leading to vaso-occlusion. In sickle cell disease, under conditions of physical stress (including surgical stress, trauma, or strenuous activity), hypoxia and acidosis can promote the polymerization of hemoglobin S. This results in the sickling of red blood cells, microvascular occlusion, and ultimately ischemic injury to brain tissue, which may manifest as transient neurological deficits or stroke. Patients with sickle cell disease may present with recurrent neurological deficits or stroke-like episodes. In this scenario, the patient\u2019s history of surgery following a bone fracture (a significant physical stressor) is a common trigger for a vaso-occlusive crisis leading to stroke. Diagnosis is based on clinical history (repeated episodes of weakness), neuroimaging (MRI can show ischemic lesions), and transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to assess cerebral blood flow velocities. Differential diagnoses include embolic strokes from other causes, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attacks related to other vasculopathies. The primary management strategy includes avoiding or mitigating provoked crises by managing triggers (such as dehydration, hypoxia, and stress). Acute stroke management in sickle cell patients may include exchange transfusions to reduce the percentage of sickled cells. Long-term management includes hydroxyurea and regular blood transfusions to reduce stroke risk. In pregnancy and lactation, these therapies are used with caution, and multidisciplinary approaches are recommended to balance maternal health with fetal safety. Option A (Physical stress) is the recognized trigger in many vaso-occlusive episodes leading to stroke in sickle cell patients, making it correct. Option B (Emotional stress) can contribute but is less commonly the direct precipitant. Option C (Hypertension) is a risk factor for stroke in general but is not the predominant trigger in sickle cell crises. Option D (Hyperventilation) is not typically associated with inducing sickling events. 1. Sickle cell crises are often precipitated by physical stress, such as surgery or trauma. 2. Recurrent neurological deficits in sickle cell patients warrant evaluation for stroke. 3. Preventative strategies, including blood transfusions and hydroxyurea, can reduce recurrence. Recent research supports the role of physical stress in precipitating vaso-occlusive crises that lead to stroke in sickle cell patients. Current guidelines emphasize early intervention with exchange transfusions and novel disease-modifying agents to limit recurrence, with adjustments in management protocols during pregnancy.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) requires prompt management to prevent hematoma expansion and secondary brain injury. Blood pressure control is a vital component of the acute management strategy. In this clinical scenario, even though the blood pressure is moderately elevated (170/90 mmHg), immediate pharmacologic intervention is warranted. In ICH, elevated blood pressure can lead to further bleeding by increasing the hydrostatic pressure within compromised vessels. Tight blood pressure control using intravenous agents helps to mitigate hematoma expansion. The choice of agent is also guided by its rapid onset and ease of titration. A patient two days post-ICH with a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg might be at risk for further hemorrhagic extension. The laboratory data being within normal limits (aside from a marginally low platelet count of 145, which remains within acceptable ranges for most interventions) support the decision to manage blood pressure rather than pursue transfusion. Diagnosis is confirmed by CT imaging showing an intracerebral hemorrhage. Differential considerations include hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke, coagulopathy-related bleeding, or vascular malformations. Laboratory evaluation, including platelet counts and coagulation profiles, helps rule out bleeding diatheses. The first-line management in ICH with moderately elevated blood pressure involves the use of intravenous antihypertensives such as labetalol, which is preferred for its quick onset and ease of titration. Second-line agents include nicardipine. Oral agents like amlodipine are avoided in the hyperacute setting due to their slower onset. Platelet transfusion is only indicated if the platelet count is significantly low (usually <50 x 10\u2079/L) or in patients on antiplatelet agents. In pregnancy, labetalol is widely accepted as a first-line antihypertensive, and its use remains appropriate during lactation. Option A (Labetalol) is the most appropriate choice for rapid blood pressure control in acute ICH. Option B (Amlodipine) is not ideal for acute management because it is typically administered orally and does not allow rapid titration. Option C (Platelet transfusion) is not indicated since the platelet count, although marginally low, remains near normal levels. Option D is blank. 1. Rapid blood pressure control in ICH is crucial to prevent hemorrhage expansion. 2. IV labetalol is a first-line agent in both general and obstetric populations. 3. Platelet transfusions are reserved for significant thrombocytopenia or antiplatelet agent use. The latest AHA/ASA guidelines for the management of intracerebral hemorrhage continue to endorse the use of IV labetalol (or nicardipine) for emergent blood pressure management. Recent studies have underscored the importance of moderate blood pressure reduction to balance the risks of hematoma expansion with the risks of cerebral hypoperfusion.",

    "explanation": "Postpartum neurological emergencies include a variety of conditions such as Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) and Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS). Both conditions can occur in the postpartum setting and may share overlapping clinical features, but specific imaging findings help to differentiate them. RCVS is characterized by transient, multifocal narrowing of the cerebral arteries due to dysregulation of cerebral vascular tone. It is commonly triggered by the postpartum state, and factors such as the use of serotonergic medications (like SSRIs) can contribute. In contrast, PRES involves vasogenic edema secondary to blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, often in the context of severe hypertension. The presence of angiographic changes (e.g., a 'string of beads' appearance) is more consistent with RCVS. In a postpartum patient with a history of SSRI use, the development of neurological symptoms along with imaging findings on CT and abnormal angiographic features strongly points to RCVS. Patients typically present with thunderclap headaches and may have transient neurological deficits. Although PRES is also seen postpartum, its hallmark is symmetrical vasogenic edema predominantly in the posterior regions of the cerebral hemispheres, without the characteristic segmental arterial constriction seen in RCVS. The diagnostic approach involves neuroimaging. MRI is optimal for detecting the vasogenic edema of PRES, while CT angiography or digital subtraction angiography can reveal the multifocal segmental narrowing typical of RCVS. Differential diagnoses include cerebral vasculitis, which tends to have a more chronic course, and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is excluded by the imaging pattern. Management of RCVS is primarily supportive. Calcium channel blockers (such as nimodipine) are commonly employed to alleviate vasospasm, and pain management is crucial. Blood pressure is typically not as dramatically elevated as in PRES, so aggressive antihypertensive therapy is less central. In postpartum patients, including those who are breastfeeding, medications like nimodipine are considered relatively safe, but individualized risk\u2010benefit analysis is still essential. For PRES, management focuses on blood pressure control and withdrawal of the inciting agent. The distinction between the two is important for guiding therapy. Option A (PRES) represents one of the differential diagnoses; however, the inclusion of angiographic findings (typically not a feature of PRES) suggests that the diagnosis is more in line with RCVS. Option B (presumed here to be RCVS) is the better match given the patient\u2019s postpartum status, the SSRI association, and the angiographic findings. Options C and D are not provided. Thus, the marked answer B is correct. 1. RCVS often presents in postpartum women with severe, thunderclap headaches and reversible arterial narrowing on angiography. 2. SSRIs and the postpartum state are recognized triggers for RCVS. 3. Differentiation between RCVS and PRES is critical, as management strategies differ. Recent literature has further delineated the diagnostic criteria for RCVS, emphasizing the role of vascular imaging to identify reversible vasoconstriction. Current guidelines advocate for supportive care with calcium channel blockers, and emerging research continues to refine the management protocols for postpartum patients presenting with these syndromes.",

    "explanation": "Postpartum women are in a hypercoagulable state due to physiological changes of pregnancy and the postpartum period. This increases their risk for venous thromboembolic events, including cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), which can present with headache and focal neurologic deficits. CVT occurs when thrombi form in the cerebral venous sinuses or cortical veins. In the postpartum period, elevated coagulation factors and reduced fibrinolysis predispose to clot formation. Thrombotic occlusion leads to increased venous pressure, disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier, vasogenic edema, and sometimes hemorrhagic venous infarction manifesting as a cortical intracerebral hemorrhage with surrounding edema. A postpartum woman presenting two weeks after delivery with headache and left-sided weakness fits the clinical picture for CVT. The imaging finding of a right cortical intracerebral hemorrhage with surrounding edema is consistent with a hemorrhagic venous infarction secondary to venous sinus thrombosis rather than a typical hypertensive or aneurysmal bleed. The diagnosis typically involves neuroimaging. An MRI combined with MR venography is the modality of choice to detect venous occlusions. Differential diagnoses include aneurysm rupture (which usually causes subarachnoid hemorrhage rather than a cortical hemorrhage) and primary intracerebral hemorrhage from hypertension. The patient\u2019s postpartum status and imaging findings should raise suspicion for CVT. According to current guidelines, the mainstay of CVT treatment is early anticoagulation \u2013 typically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) even when intracerebral hemorrhage is present. In the postpartum period, LMWH is preferred due to its safety profile in lactating women and its predictable pharmacokinetics. Second-line treatments might include unfractionated heparin in cases where rapid reversal might be necessary. Follow\u2010up imaging and long\u2010term anticoagulation duration are individualized based on risk factors. Option A (aneurysm rupture) is unlikely because aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage typically presents with a sudden severe headache and subarachnoid blood on imaging, not a cortical ICH with surrounding edema. Marked Answer B (CVT) is correct given the patient\u2019s postpartum hypercoagulable state and the imaging findings. Options C and D were not provided. 1. The postpartum period is a high-risk time for venous thromboembolic events, including CVT. 2. CVT can cause hemorrhagic venous infarctions, so a hemorrhage on imaging does not preclude the diagnosis. 3. Anticoagulation is indicated for CVT even in the presence of hemorrhage. Recent research and guideline updates (including AHA/ASA recommendations) emphasize early diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulation therapy in CVT. Studies have supported the safety and efficacy of LMWH in postpartum patients, reinforcing its role even when hemorrhagic infarction is present.",

    "explanation": "Management of carotid artery disease in the context of stroke is largely driven by the degree of stenosis and symptoms. Surgical interventions like carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are typically reserved for high-grade stenoses in symptomatic individuals. Atherosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid arteries can lead to luminal narrowing. In this patient, the moderate stenosis (60-65%) suggests atherosclerotic disease that has not reached thresholds (generally \u226570% in symptomatic patients) where surgical intervention confers a significant benefit over medical therapy. The elderly patient with vascular risk factors (DM and HTN) presenting with acute right-sided weakness is suggestive for an ischemic stroke. CTA findings showing moderate carotid stenosis indicate that the stroke is more likely due to small vessel or other embolic mechanisms rather than significant carotid artery obstruction warranting surgical revascularization. The diagnostic workup in stroke includes vascular imaging (like CTA or carotid Duplex ultrasound) to assess carotid stenosis. Differential diagnoses include cardioembolic stroke, intracranial atherosclerotic disease, and lacunar strokes. The decision between medical versus surgical management hinges on the degree of stenosis and whether the patient is symptomatic. Current guidelines recommend intensive medical management (antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure control, and lifestyle modifications) as the first-line approach for moderate carotid stenosis. Carotid revascularization (CEA or stenting) is indicated primarily in symptomatic patients with at least 70% stenosis. For a 75-year-old with moderate stenosis and significant comorbidities, maximizing medical therapy is most appropriate. In terms of pregnancy and lactation, this scenario does not apply; however, emphasis on medical management is similarly preferred when surgical risks outweigh benefits. Option A (Maximize medical management) is correct because the stenosis levels (60% and 65%) do not meet the threshold for surgical intervention. Option B (Carotid endarterectomy) and Option C (Elective carotid stenting) are typically reserved for higher-grade stenosis. Option D (Stenting within 1 week) is not appropriate given the degree and the acute setting without severe stenoses. 1. In symptomatic patients, carotid revascularization is generally considered when stenosis is 70% or greater. 2. Intensive medical management is the cornerstone for moderate carotid stenosis. 3. Risk factor modification is critical in stroke prevention. Recent trials and guideline updates (including those from the AHA/ASA and the European Society for Vascular Surgery) support optimal medical therapy for moderate carotid stenosis, highlighting that surgical benefits are most pronounced in patients with high-grade (>70%) stenosis.",

    "explanation": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired thrombophilia that predisposes patients to both arterial and venous thrombosis. In pregnant patients, APS poses a significant risk for stroke and recurrent venous thromboembolic events, making anticoagulation the cornerstone of management. APS involves the production of antiphospholipid antibodies (eg, anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant) that interfere with normal coagulation. These antibodies lead to endothelial dysfunction and activation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in both arterial (stroke) and venous (DVT) thrombosis. The presence of a small patent foramen ovale (PFO) is incidental in this context and does not drive the treatment strategy. A pregnant woman with a history of DVT and a positive APS screen who also presents with a stroke strongly suggests that her event is due to hypercoagulability associated with APS. In pregnancy, warfarin is contraindicated owing to its teratogenicity, and PFO closure is not indicated for APS-related strokes. The diagnosis of APS is based on clinical criteria (history of thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity) plus laboratory confirmation (presence of antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions at least 12 weeks apart). Differential considerations include cardioembolic strokes from PFO-related paradoxical embolism; however, the history of DVT and APS positivity points toward a thrombophilic process. For pregnant patients with APS, the current guideline-recommended first-line treatment is the use of heparin \u2013 typically low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) \u2013 often in combination with low-dose aspirin. This regimen is safe during pregnancy and lactation. Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenic effects, and PFO closure is not recommended given that the underlying issue is hypercoagulability rather than an anatomic shunt. Option A (Aspirin) alone is insufficient for a high-risk APS patient with a history of DVT and stroke. Option B (Close the PFO) addresses a potential embolic source but is not indicated when APS is the underlying cause. Option D (Warfarin) is contraindicated in pregnancy. Option C (Heparin) is the correct choice as it effectively anticoagulates the patient while being safe in pregnancy. 1. In pregnant patients with APS, LMWH plus low-dose aspirin is the standard treatment to prevent recurrent thrombosis. 2. A small PFO in an APS patient is likely incidental; focus should be on managing the hypercoagulable state. 3. Warfarin is prohibited during pregnancy due to its known teratogenic risks. Recent studies and updated guidelines (including those from the American College of Rheumatology and obstetrical societies) consistently support the combined use of LMWH and aspirin in pregnant patients with APS to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications.",

    "question": "Stroke within window what should be done before IV tPA.",

    "explanation": "Before administration of IV tPA for acute ischemic stroke, it is crucial to rule out mimics and contraindications. One of the rapid, bedside tests is the measurement of blood glucose, as hypoglycemia can produce stroke-like symptoms. Hypoglycemia can lead to focal neurological deficits that closely mimic a stroke. Because tPA is a potent thrombolytic agent with significant hemorrhagic risks, it is imperative to ensure that the patient\u2019s symptoms are due to true ischemic stroke rather than a metabolic disturbance. In an acute stroke setting, rapid evaluation is paramount. A fingerstick blood glucose test is easily performed, and abnormal values (too low or too high) must be corrected before considering thrombolytic therapy. This helps prevent unnecessary administration of tPA to patients with stroke mimics. Prior to IV tPA administration, the standard workup includes a non-contrast CT scan to exclude hemorrhage, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose measurement, and assessment of coagulation parameters if indicated (especially in patients on anticoagulants). Differential considerations include hypoglycemia, which can both mimic and worsen neurological deficits. Current guidelines (AHA/ASA) mandate that a bedside blood glucose test be performed in all suspected stroke patients before tPA administration to rule out hypoglycemia. Although coagulation studies and ECG are also important components of the overall stroke workup, the glucose test is rapid and critical in the immediate decision-making process. In pregnancy or lactation, similar protocols are used; however, additional considerations (like radiation exposure from CT) are managed with protective measures. tPA itself is contraindicated in certain pregnancy settings but may be considered in life-threatening strokes with informed risk-benefit discussions. Option A (Coagulation) is important if there is suspicion of a coagulopathy or if the patient is on anticoagulants, but it is not as immediately critical as checking blood glucose. Option C (ECG) is useful for detecting arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation) that might suggest a cardioembolic source but is not a prerequisite for tPA administration. Marked Answer B (Glucose Level) is correct because verifying a normal blood glucose level is a rapid and necessary step to avoid treating a stroke mimic. 1. Always perform a rapid fingerstick blood glucose test in suspected stroke cases before administering tPA. 2. Hypoglycemia can mimic stroke, so its prompt correction is essential. 3. Although additional tests (coagulation studies, ECG) are important, they are secondary to the immediate check of blood glucose in the acute setting. Recent AHA/ASA guidelines reiterate the necessity of checking blood glucose immediately in the acute stroke setting to ensure that the clinical picture is indeed due to ischemia and not a hypoglycemic event. This practice remains a cornerstone in the door-to-needle protocols for IV thrombolysis.",

    "question": "Same picture of Moyamoya in Q12 with right side weakness and CTA showing severe stenosis in the left MCA, what to do next",
    "option_a": "Exchange Transfusion",
    "option_b": "Aspirin and Plavix",

    "explanation": "Moyamoya syndrome is characterized by progressive steno\u2010occlusive changes in the terminal portions of the internal carotid arteries and their proximal branches. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), a moyamoya pattern may develop as a complication of chronic vaso-occlusive injury. In the acute setting of a stroke with evidence of severe MCA stenosis in an SCD patient, rapid reduction of sickled hemoglobin (HbS) is critical. In SCD, abnormal hemoglobin S leads to red cell sickling under stress conditions. These sickled cells trigger endothelial injury, promoting intimal proliferation and eventual vascular stenosis and occlusion. The moyamoya\u2010like vascular changes, with the formation of fragile collateral vessels, predispose the patient to ischemic events. Urgent reduction of circulating HbS via exchange transfusion improves blood rheology and oxygen delivery, helping to limit infarct size. The patient\u2019s right-sided weakness correlates with left MCA territory ischemia. In the context of a sickle cell patient showing imaging features of moyamoya, the clinical picture is that of an acute ischemic stroke precipitated by vaso-occlusion. Rapid intervention is essential to mitigate further neurologic damage. Diagnosis is typically made with non-invasive imaging such as CTA or MRA to document the stenotic changes. Differential diagnoses include atherosclerotic stroke, vasculitis, or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), but in a young patient with SCD and moyamoya findings, vaso-occlusion is the underlying mechanism. Confirmation of sickle cell status and hemoglobin electrophoresis support the diagnosis. For an acute ischemic stroke in a sickle cell patient with moyamoya-like features, the first-line treatment is urgent exchange transfusion to reduce circulating HbS levels (aiming for <30%). This intervention is critical to arrest further sickling and ischemic injury. Long-term management may include possible revascularization surgery after stabilization and rigorous secondary stroke prevention measures. In pregnant or lactating patients with SCD, exchange transfusion is considered safe with appropriate hematologic consultation and monitoring, as the benefits in reducing ischemic brain injury outweigh potential risks. Option A (Exchange Transfusion) is correct because it directly addresses the acute pathophysiology of sickle cell\u2013related stroke by reducing HbS and improving cerebral perfusion. Option B (Aspirin and Plavix) is more appropriate for atherosclerotic or non\u2013sickle cell embolic strokes and does not address the unique pathophysiology of SCD. Option C (Labetalol) is aimed at blood pressure control and is not the primary acute treatment for sickle cell stroke. \u2022 In SCD patients with stroke, early exchange transfusion can limit infarct expansion.  \u2022 Moyamoya syndrome in SCD warrants careful neuroimaging evaluation.  \u2022 Time is brain \u2013 rapid intervention is essential in vaso-occlusive stroke. Recent guidelines from hematology and stroke societies support early exchange transfusion in SCD patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. Studies have demonstrated that prompt reduction of HbS levels significantly reduces the progression of cerebral infarction, and this approach is endorsed in current SCD management protocols.",
