    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with a lacunar stroke, most commonly a result of small vessel disease rather than a paradoxical embolism from a patent foramen ovale (PFO). In older patients with vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension) and imaging evidence of extracranial atherosclerosis, the stroke is best attributed to intrinsic vascular pathology. Therefore, management is focused on secondary prevention with medical therapy (i.e., antiplatelet agents such as aspirin) rather than interventional closure of a PFO. Lacunar strokes are small, deep infarcts in the brain due to lipohyalinosis or microatheroma of penetrating arteries. Although a PFO can serve as a conduit for paradoxical embolism, in older patients with significant vascular risk factors and extracranial atherosclerosis, the stroke mechanism is more likely due to small vessel disease. The management focus is on preventing further thrombotic events, controlling risk factors, and reducing atherosclerotic progression. Patients with lacunar strokes may present with pure motor or sensorimotor deficits depending on the location, with the posterior limb of the internal capsule being a classic site. The presence of a PFO in this context is typically incidental, and the finding of significant atherosclerosis on CTA further supports a non-cardioembolic source. Imaging modalities such as MRI (to characterize lacunar infarcts) and CTA (to assess extracranial vessels) are used. Differential diagnoses include cardioembolic events (where PFO might be implicated) and large vessel strokes. The presence of atherosclerosis and risk factors helps differentiate a lacunar (small vessel) stroke from PFO-related events. Current guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy (i.e., low-dose aspirin) as first-line secondary prevention in lacunar strokes. Risk factor modification (control of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) and lifestyle changes are critical. For patients on antiplatelet therapy, low-dose aspirin is considered safe in pregnancy and lactation when needed for other indications, though its use in stroke prevention is primarily an adult/elderly concern. PFO closure is reserved for select younger patients with cryptogenic strokes in whom no other cause is identified. Option A (PFO closure) is not indicated because, in this elderly patient with clear vascular risk factors and imaging evidence of extracranial atherosclerosis, the stroke is more likely due to small vessel disease rather than paradoxical embolism. Option B (Aspirin) is correct as it targets the pathophysiology of small vessel thromboembolism and forms the cornerstone of secondary prevention in lacunar strokes. 1. Lacunar strokes are most often due to small vessel disease related to chronic hypertension and diabetes. 2. PFO closure is generally indicated in younger patients with cryptogenic stroke after thorough evaluation. 3. Extracranial atherosclerosis on imaging reinforces the need for medical management rather than an interventional approach in older individuals. Recent trials and stroke management guidelines continue to support the use of antiplatelet therapy for lacunar infarcts along with aggressive risk factor management. Further, evidence has not shown a benefit for PFO closure in older patients with lacunar strokes associated with significant atherosclerosis.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is managed primarily with optimal medical therapy, especially when the degree of stenosis is moderate. A patient with a 60% stenosis, in the absence of symptoms, typically does not warrant surgical intervention because the perioperative risk may outweigh the benefits of carotid revascularization. Extracranial carotid stenosis is most often due to atherosclerotic plaque buildup. The ischemic risk in asymptomatic patients has been reduced substantially due to advancements in medical management, including statin therapy, antihypertensives, and antiplatelet agents. In asymptomatic patients, the carotid stenosis is detected incidentally or through screening studies. The risk of stroke remains lower compared with symptomatic patients, and medical therapy aims at halting plaque progression and reducing cardiovascular risk. Diagnosis is commonly made using carotid duplex ultrasound with confirmation by CTA or MRA if needed. Differential diagnoses for carotid artery disease include dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, and symptomatic carotid stenosis where associated neurological deficits are present. Distinction is made based on clinical presentation and imaging findings. The first-line approach for asymptomatic moderate carotid stenosis is aggressive medical management which includes antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin), statins, lifestyle modification, and meticulous control of hypertension and diabetes. Carotid endarterectomy or stenting is typically reserved for patients with high-grade stenosis (usually >70%) or in select high-risk plaques with additional risk factors. In pregnant or lactating patients, therapeutic decisions must consider the safety profile of medications (low-dose aspirin and statins are managed on a case-by-case basis with risk\u2013benefit discussions). Option A (maximize medical therapy) is correct because it aligns with current recommendations for asymptomatic moderate carotid stenosis. Option B (carotid endarterectomy) and Option C (carotid stenting) are typically reserved for patients with symptomatic high-grade stenosis or select high-risk asymptomatic patients, not a 60% lesion. 1. Asymptomatic carotid stenosis up to 60\u201370% is primarily managed with medical therapy. 2. The risk of surgical intervention may not be justified in moderate lesions without symptoms. 3. Regular monitoring and risk factor management are key to preventing stroke in these patients. Recent guidelines and research underscore the effectiveness of intensive medical therapy in asymptomatic carotid stenosis, with many studies showing that optimal medical management has improved outcomes and reduced the absolute risk of stroke compared to historical surgical series.",

    "option_d": "PICA",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Medial medullary syndrome, also known as Dejerine syndrome, is characterized by infarction of the medial aspect of the medulla oblongata. The primary vascular supply to this region is provided by the anterior spinal artery or its branches arising from the vertebral artery. Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery leads to ischemia of the medial medulla, affecting the corticospinal tract, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nerve nucleus/fibers. This results in a clinical syndrome of contralateral motor weakness and proprioceptive deficits with ipsilateral hypoglossal palsy. Patients typically present with a combination of contralateral hemiparesis, contralateral loss of proprioception and fine touch, along with an ipsilateral tongue weakness (which may manifest as tongue deviation toward the affected side). Recognizing the vascular territory helps differentiate medial medullary syndrome from lateral medullary (Wallenberg) or other brainstem syndromes. Neuroimaging, particularly MRI, is essential to localize the infarct. Differential diagnoses include lateral medullary syndrome (typically due to PICA occlusion) and other brainstem infarcts. The pattern of deficits (especially the involvement of the hypoglossal nerve) helps pinpoint a medial medullary lesion. Acute management involves standard ischemic stroke protocols (e.g., evaluation for thrombolysis within the appropriate time window if applicable). Secondary prevention with antiplatelet agents and risk factor control (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) is essential. In the setting of pregnancy or lactation, management is individualized, with careful consideration of the risks and benefits of thrombolytic therapy and other medications, often necessitating multidisciplinary consultation. Option A (Posterior spinal artery) is incorrect because the posterior spinal artery does not primarily supply the medial medulla. Option B (Anterior spinal artery) is correct as it supplies the medial medullary territory. Option C (Basilar artery) typically produces more widespread brainstem symptoms when occluded, and Option D (PICA) is associated with lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome), not medial medullary syndrome. 1. Medial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is characterized by contralateral hemiparesis with ipsilateral tongue weakness. 2. The anterior spinal artery is the key vascular supplier to the medial medulla. 3. Differentiating medial versus lateral medullary syndromes is crucial for accurate localization of the lesion. Recent neuroimaging advancements have reinforced the understanding of brainstem vascular territories, and current stroke guidelines continue to recommend rapid imaging and supportive care as the cornerstones of management in brainstem strokes.",

    "option_a": "Vit K.",
    "option_b": "",
    "option_c": "Idarocizumab.",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Patients on dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, who develop serious bleeding complications such as intracranial hemorrhage require prompt reversal of its anticoagulant effects. Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that specifically binds dabigatran and reverses its effect rapidly. Dabigatran exerts its anticoagulant effect by directly inhibiting thrombin, thereby preventing fibrin clot formation. In the event of an acute bleeding complication, particularly in the context of an invasive procedure like thrombectomy, the anticoagulant effect can exacerbate hemorrhage. Idarucizumab binds dabigatran with high affinity, neutralizing its anticoagulant activity almost immediately. In this clinical scenario, the patient developed a hemorrhage over the MCA territory after thrombectomy while on dabigatran for atrial fibrillation. Rapid reversal of dabigatran is critical to control the hemorrhage and prevent further neurological deterioration. Evaluating anticoagulant use and coagulation parameters is essential, especially in the setting of hemorrhagic transformation after a revascularization procedure. Differential considerations include bleeding due to procedural complications versus medication-induced coagulopathy. Laboratory tests measuring thrombin time and aPTT can provide additional information but are often not necessary when the clinical situation demands immediate reversal. According to current guidelines, idarucizumab is the first-line reversal agent for dabigatran-induced bleeding. It is administered intravenously in a fixed dose and provides rapid reversal. Supportive measures, blood pressure control, and neurosurgical consultation may also be necessary. In pregnant or lactating patients, dabigatran is contraindicated; however, in an emergency situation with inadvertent exposure, the use of idarucizumab should be weighed against the potential risks and benefits in a multidisciplinary setting, although data in this population remain limited. Option A (Vitamin K) is used for reversing warfarin but has no effect on dabigatran. Option C (Idarucizumab) is correct as it is the specific reversal agent indicated for dabigatran-associated bleeding. Options B and D are not provided or relevant in this scenario. 1. Always confirm the specific anticoagulant agent when managing a bleeding complication \u2013 dabigatran reversal is achieved with idarucizumab, not vitamin K. 2. Idarucizumab acts rapidly, which is critical in life-threatening hemorrhages such as intracerebral bleeding. 3. Knowing the reversal agents for different anticoagulants is essential in acute stroke management. Recent studies and updated guidelines support the use of idarucizumab in dabigatran-associated bleeding. Its rapid action helps to minimize hemorrhagic progression and improve clinical outcomes. Ongoing research continues to monitor long-term outcomes in patients reversed with idarucizumab, especially regarding intracranial hemorrhages.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a distinct, non-aneurysmal type of SAH characterized by bleeding localized around the midbrain. Its recognition is based on a characteristic CT appearance and the absence of aneurysms on angiography. The precise mechanism remains uncertain, but it is believed that a venous bleed from small perimesencephalic vessels is responsible. Unlike aneurysmal SAH, these hemorrhages rarely rebleed or lead to vasospasm, contributing to a more benign clinical course when high\u2010quality angiographic studies are negative. Patients typically present with sudden onset headache, often described as severe and \u2018thunderclap\u2019 in nature, yet they tend to have a lower rate of complications compared to aneurysmal SAH. The negative repeated angiographic evaluations confirm the diagnosis and reassure both the clinician and the patient. After a CT scan demonstrates a hemorrhage confined to the perimesencephalic cisterns, the next step is vascular imaging. Both computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are used to exclude aneurysms. Differential diagnoses include aneurysmal SAH, traumatic SAH, and other causes of non-aneurysmal hemorrhage. The typical distribution on CT and the absence of aneurysms on two independent studies help differentiate perimesencephalic SAH from other types. The management of perimesencephalic SAH is conservative and supportive. Guidelines recommend observation, control of pain, blood pressure monitoring, and management for any complications that may arise (such as hydrocephalus or rare vasospasm). Once two high\u2010quality angiograms are negative and the patient remains stable, no further invasive vascular studies are necessary. In terms of pregnancy and lactation, supportive treatments are used while avoiding medications that could adversely affect the fetus, with careful monitoring and observation being key. Option A (send home) is correct provided that the patient has been adequately observed in the hospital, all imaging (including at least two angiograms) is negative, and the clinical course is stable. Option B (repeat digital subtraction angiogram) is not warranted due to the high level of confidence already established with the previous angiograms. 1. Perimesencephalic SAH is associated with a benign course and very low risk of rebleeding. 2. Two negative angiographic studies in the appropriate CT pattern generally obviate the need for further invasive testing. Recent studies and guidelines support a conservative approach to perimesencephalic SAH. With advances in CT imaging and high-quality angiographic techniques, the benign nature of this hemorrhage is well recognized, leading to safe early discharge after a period of observation.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Hemiplegic migraine is a rare variant of migraine with aura that includes motor weakness alongside visual or sensory disturbances. It can mimic transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or strokes, making a detailed clinical history essential for correct diagnosis. The mechanism involves cortical spreading depression, which leads to transient neuronal hyperexcitability followed by inhibition. This phenomenon not only causes the typical visual and sensory auras but can also affect motor areas of the cortex, leading to transient hemiparesis. Genetic factors may also play a role in familial forms. Patients with hemiplegic migraine often experience a progression of symptoms: visual aura (such as flashing lights), followed by sensory or motor deficits (like hemianopia or hemiparesis), and then headache. The gradual and spreading nature of the aura, along with the subsequent headache, distinguishes it from TIA, which usually presents more abruptly and often lacks a migrainous headache. The workup includes a detailed headache history, a neurological examination, and neuroimaging studies. In migraine aura, imaging studies such as CT, CTA, and DWI are typically normal, especially once the episode has resolved. Differential diagnoses include TIA/stroke, which tend to have more abrupt onset, risk factors like hypertension or atrial fibrillation, and may show DWI abnormalities if infarction occurs. Acute management focuses on symptom relief and may include analgesics and antiemetics. Specific migraine abortive therapies that cause vasoconstriction, such as triptans and ergot derivatives, are contraindicated in hemiplegic migraine. Prophylactic treatments may be considered in frequent or severe cases. In pregnancy and lactation, treatment options are limited; typically, acetaminophen is preferred for pain control and non-pharmacologic measures are emphasized. Option A (hemiplegic migraine) is the correct diagnosis because the patient\u2019s progression\u2014starting with visual phenomena (flashing lights), evolving into a homonymous hemianopia and motor weakness, and followed by headache\u2014fits the pattern of a migrainous aura rather than a vascular TIA. Option B (TIA) is less likely given the clear migrainous features and the normal imaging studies. 1. Hemiplegic migraine can closely mimic TIA; however, the gradual onset and evolution of symptoms with a subsequent headache are key distinguishing features. 2. Imaging studies (CT, CTA, DWI) are typically normal in migrainous phenomena once the event has resolved. Contemporary guidelines stress the importance of distinguishing migraine aura from cerebrovascular events, as misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatments. Advances in neuroimaging and a better understanding of migraine pathophysiology have helped clarify this differentiation, guiding clinicians towards safer, more appropriate management strategies.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Warfarin-induced hemorrhage, especially intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), is a life-threatening complication that requires rapid reversal of anticoagulation to stop the bleeding and prevent further intracranial damage. Warfarin works by inhibiting vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X). An elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR) indicates an increased bleeding risk. In cases of ICH, rapid reversal is achieved by replenishing these factors via prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and by providing vitamin K to allow for synthesis of new clotting factors. The patient\u2019s presentation with ICH on a background of warfarin use and an elevated INR (5) is a classic scenario where reversal of coagulation is the priority. PCC works rapidly to replace clotting factors while vitamin K ensures a more sustained reversal effect, preventing re-accumulation of the anticoagulant effect. In a warfarin-associated ICH, history and laboratory studies (INR measurement) are crucial. CT imaging is used to identify and assess the extent of hemorrhage. Differential diagnoses include spontaneous ICH from hypertension and other coagulopathies, but the history of warfarin use and an elevated INR direct the diagnosis. The latest guidelines recommend the immediate reversal of warfarin in ICH patients using PCC combined with intravenous vitamin K (typically 5\u201310 mg IV slow push). PCC provides immediate replacement of clotting factors, while vitamin K allows the body to produce new factors over the ensuing hours. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be considered only if PCC is not available because it has a slower preparation time and higher volume, which may be problematic. In pregnancy and lactation, vitamin K is safe and the reversal strategy remains similar, though clinicians must balance the risks and benefits carefully. Option A (Vitamin K) is correct as an addition to PCC to ensure sustained correction of the warfarin-induced coagulopathy. Option B (FFP) is less ideal when PCC is already given because of its slower effect and risk profile, though it may be used when PCC is unavailable. 1. In warfarin-related ICH, rapid reversal of the coagulopathy is critical to reducing hematoma expansion. 2. Using PCC in conjunction with vitamin K is the recommended strategy for effective and sustained reversal. Recent guidelines from agencies like the American Heart Association (AHA) and the Neurocritical Care Society endorse the combination of PCC and vitamin K for warfarin reversal. Emerging evidence has shown superior outcomes with PCC use compared to FFP, with faster correction of INR and reduced complications.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary small vessel disease characterized by migraine (often with aura), recurrent TIAs or strokes, and personality changes. The anterior temporal lobe involvement on MRI is a classic radiographic clue. CADASIL results from mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which encodes a receptor important for vascular smooth muscle function. Mutated proteins accumulate in the vessel walls, leading to degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells and subsequent ischemic changes in the white matter. The patient\u2019s history of migraine, a recent TIA, and a family history of stroke, along with MRI findings involving the anterior temporal lobe, are all highly suggestive of CADASIL. This condition often presents in mid-adulthood with transient ischemic events and subcortical white matter changes. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical suspicion supported by MRI findings. The involvement of the anterior temporal lobes and external capsules are distinguishing radiologic features. Confirmation is achieved through genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations. Differential diagnoses include other small vessel ischemic diseases and demyelinating conditions, but the unique MRI pattern and family history point towards CADASIL. There is no definitive cure for CADASIL; management is focused on controlling vascular risk factors, preventing stroke recurrence, and symptomatic treatment of migraines. Antiplatelet therapy is often used for secondary prevention in TIA/stroke, though evidence is limited. Genetic counseling is essential, especially when considering family planning. During pregnancy and lactation, treatment is largely supportive and focuses on minimizing stroke risk while avoiding medications that could adversely affect the fetus or infant. Option A (NOTCH 3) is correct because the presence of anterior temporal lobe involvement on MRI in a patient with migraine and stroke, along with a family history, strongly points towards CADASIL, which is linked to NOTCH3 gene mutations. Other options (B, C, D) are not provided or relevant in this context. 1. Anterior temporal lobe hyperintensities on MRI are a hallmark of CADASIL. 2. A history of migraine with aura combined with a family history of stroke in a relatively young patient should prompt consideration of a genetic small vessel disease like CADASIL. Recent research continues to refine our understanding of CADASIL\u2019s genetic underpinnings. Latest guidelines emphasize the importance of MRI patterns and genetic testing for early diagnosis. While no disease-modifying treatment exists, ongoing studies are exploring potential therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating vascular smooth muscle dysfunction.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a cerebrovascular disorder where thrombosis develops in the dural venous sinuses or cerebral veins. It can be provoked by transient factors such as oral contraceptive (OCP) use, pregnancy, or other reversible hypercoagulable states. OCPs increase the risk of thrombosis by inducing a hypercoagulable state, likely through estrogen\u2010mediated changes in coagulation factors. In a provoked CVT (with a negative thrombophilia workup) the underlying trigger is removable, leading to a lower recurrence risk once the agent is discontinued. The thrombus impedes venous outflow, increasing venous pressure, and causing edema and possibly hemorrhagic infarction. Patients with CVT often present with headache, focal neurological deficits, seizures, and papilledema. When CVT is associated with a transient trigger \u2013 such as OCP use \u2013 the overall prognosis is favorable if the causal factor is eliminated. CVT is typically diagnosed via imaging such as CT venography or MR venography. Differential diagnoses include arterial stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Detailed history regarding risk factors (like OCP use) helps differentiate it from other causes of cerebrovascular events. Current guidelines recommend initial treatment with heparin (often low molecular weight heparin) followed by oral anticoagulation for 3-6 months in cases of provoked CVT. In women with OCP-related CVT, discontinuation of the OCP is imperative. For pregnant patients, LMWH is preferred given warfarin\u2019s teratogenicity; in lactating patients, warfarin can be used safely as minimal amounts are excreted in breast milk. Lifelong anticoagulation is reserved for patients with recurrent events or proven thrombophilia. Option A (lifelong) is not indicated because the CVT in this case is provoked by a reversible risk factor (OCP use) with a negative thrombophilia workup. Option B (3-6 months) is correct, as the standard duration for anticoagulation in a provoked CVT is typically 3-6 months. 1. Always consider OCP use as a reversible risk factor in CVT. 2. Provoked CVT usually requires a finite course of anticoagulation (3-6 months) rather than lifelong therapy. Recent guidelines, including those from the AHA/ASA, support a 3-6 month duration of anticoagulation in cases of provoked CVT. Ongoing research continues to refine risk stratification and duration based on individual patient factors and imaging findings.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Cerebellar infarcts, especially when extensive, can lead to mass effect in the confined space of the posterior fossa. The posterior fossa is a tight skull compartment containing the brainstem and cerebellum, making any swelling a potential neurosurgical emergency. Infarction of the cerebellum results in cerebral edema due to cytotoxic swelling. This edema can cause a mass effect with midline shift and crowding of the posterior fossa, which increases intracranial pressure and risks brainstem compression. Patients with cerebellar infarcts may present with vertigo, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and may deteriorate rapidly if brainstem compression ensues. The presence of midline shift and crowding indicates a higher risk of herniation. Noncontrast CT is typically used to diagnose a cerebellar infarct and assess for associated mass effect. Differential diagnoses include cerebellar hemorrhage, neoplasm, or abscess. Distinguishing features on imaging and the clinical setting help differentiate these conditions. Given the mass effect, the immediate management of a cerebellar infarct with midline shift and posterior fossa crowding is neurosurgical evaluation. Surgical interventions, such as suboccipital decompressive craniectomy, may be needed. Medical management may include admission to the ICU for close neurological monitoring, but tPA is contraindicated in this setting, especially beyond the typical window and in the presence of mass effect. In pregnant patients, neurosurgical interventions require special anesthetic considerations, and imaging protocols may be adjusted to minimize fetal exposure; management remains urgent. Similar principles apply in lactation, with attention to medication safety. Option A (start Aspirin) and Option B (Give tPA) are inappropriate given the patient's imaging findings and timing relative to symptom onset. Option D (admit ICU & monitor ICP) is supportive but insufficient as a standalone measure when significant mass effect is present. Option C (consult neurosurgery) is the correct and definitive step given the urgency of mass effect in the posterior fossa. 1. Significant cerebellar edema with midline shift mandates early neurosurgical consultation to prevent brainstem compromise. 2. Thrombolytic therapy (tPA) is contraindicated outside the treatment window and in patients with mass effect. Recent stroke management guidelines emphasize the need for rapid neurosurgical assessment in patients with cerebellar infarctions showing signs of mass effect.

    "explanation": "Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic pain condition characterized by sudden, brief, and lancinating facial pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. It is often triggered by minimal stimulation such as light touch, speaking, or chewing. The classic form of trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by a neurovascular conflict, where an artery (commonly the superior cerebellar artery) compresses the trigeminal nerve root, leading to demyelination. This demyelination results in ectopic nerve firing and paroxysmal pain. Patients typically report episodes of severe, sharp, electric shock-like pain that lasts for seconds. These episodes can be triggered by everyday activities and severely impact quality of life. While the diagnosis is primarily clinical, high-resolution MRI can be used to confirm the presence of a vascular loop compressing the nerve. Differential diagnoses include postherpetic neuralgia, dental causes of facial pain, and atypical facial pain syndromes. First-line treatment is with anticonvulsant medications, with carbamazepine being the drug of choice due to its efficacy in reducing neural hyperexcitability. If patients do not respond or experience intolerable side effects, second-line options include oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, or surgical treatments (such as microvascular decompression) in refractory cases. In pregnant patients, carbamazepine is associated with teratogenicity (FDA Category D) and must be used with caution\u2014alternative agents or careful risk-benefit analysis is advised. For lactating mothers, the use of carbamazepine requires monitoring of the infant due to possible drug exposure via breast milk. Option B (carbamazepine) is correct as it is the first-line medical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. Option A (decompressive surgery) is typically reserved for patients who are refractory to medical management. 1.

    "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic neurocutaneous disorder characterized by distinctive skin findings such as caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, neurofibromas, and sometimes associated neurobehavioral issues like ADHD. It is one of the most common genetically inherited disorders affecting the skin and nervous system. NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which codes for neurofibromin\u2014a tumor suppressor protein involved in the regulation of cell growth. Loss of neurofibromin function leads to abnormal cell proliferation and the development of neurofibromas, along with pigmentary skin changes. Additionally, neurodevelopmental issues such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently observed. In pediatric patients presenting with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and behavioral symptoms such as ADHD, NF1 should be strongly considered. The presence of multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait macules is a hallmark feature of NF1, differentiating it from NF2, which more commonly presents with bilateral vestibular schwannomas and lacks the pigmentary abnormalities. Diagnosis of NF1 is primarily clinical, based on NIH diagnostic criteria which include: six or more caf\u00e9-au-lait macules (of a specified size), neurofibromas or a family history, freckling in the axillary/inguinal regions, Lisch nodules, and bony dysplasia. Differential diagnoses include other neurocutaneous syndromes such as NF2 and Legius syndrome, with distinctive features differentiating them. Management of NF1 is multidisciplinary and focuses on monitoring for complications such as optic pathway gliomas, skeletal abnormalities, and learning disabilities including ADHD. Behavioral issues are managed using standard ADHD therapies with consideration of age and individual tolerability; however, potential side effects of medications (e.g., stimulant-associated appetite suppression or sleep disturbances) should be monitored. In pregnant patients with NF1, there is an increased risk of complications such as hypertension and tumor growth, necessitating close surveillance. There are no specific contraindications during lactation, though management should be individualized. Option 1 (NF1) is correct because the combination of caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and ADHD is classic for Neurofibromatosis type 1. Option 2 (NF2) is incorrect as it primarily manifests with bilateral vestibular schwannomas and does not typically include the pigmentary or neurobehavioral features seen in NF1. 1. Caf\u00e9-au-lait macules are a key dermatologic clue to NF1 in children. 2. NF1 is frequently associated with neurodevelopmental issues such as ADHD, necessitating early behavioral evaluation and intervention. Recent research has focused on genotype-phenotype correlations in NF1 and early intervention strategies for neurodevelopmental disorders. Updated consensus guidelines emphasize regular multidisciplinary screening for complications, including routine ophthalmologic and neurological evaluations.",

    "explanation": "A posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory infarction is a type of ischemic stroke affecting the posterior circulation. The mainstay of management for most ischemic strokes, when thrombolysis is not pursued or is contraindicated, is antithrombotic therapy, with current guidelines supporting dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in selected cases (e.g., minor stroke) to reduce early recurrence. Occlusion of the PICA leads to ischemia in the portions of the cerebellum (and possibly lateral medulla) it supplies. The resulting infarction may cause local tissue damage with risk for edema and, in some cases, mass effect. In many cases without large swelling or compressive effects, the infarction is managed medically. Patients with PICA infarctions can present with symptoms such as vertigo, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes features of lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome if the medulla is involved. The clinical picture, along with CT (or MRI) imaging, guides management decisions. Initial imaging with non-contrast CT is used to rule out hemorrhage and identify infarction. Differential diagnoses include cerebellar hemorrhage, brainstem lesions, and posterior fossa neoplasms. MRI imaging may provide additional detail if needed. The clinical context (size of infarct, presence of edema) guides whether neurosurgical consultation is later required if there is a risk of brainstem compression. For an acute ischemic stroke in a non\u2010thrombolysis candidate or after thrombolysis, current guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy. In patients with minor stroke (often defined with low NIHSS scores) dual antiplatelet therapy \u2013 typically aspirin plus clopidogrel \u2013 is recommended for a short duration (commonly 21 to 90 days) to reduce early recurrent stroke risk. In patients who are pregnant or lactating, low-dose aspirin is generally considered acceptable when needed; clopidogrel may be used with caution, although risks and benefits should be carefully weighed with specialist consultation. Option A (Neurosurgery consultation) is generally reserved for patients with significant cerebellar edema or mass effect leading to neurological deterioration, which is not indicated by the scenario provided. Option B (Dual antiplatelet therapy) is appropriate in the acute ischemic stroke setting for secondary prevention in a minor stroke, making it the correct choice. Options C and D are not provided or not indicated. \u2022 Dual antiplatelet therapy should be considered in minor ischemic strokes to prevent early recurrence. \u2022 Always assess for signs of cerebellar edema in posterior circulation strokes, which may require urgent neurosurgical intervention. \u2022 Early CT imaging helps differentiate infarction from hemorrhage, guiding management decisions. Recent studies, including the CHANCE and POINT trials, have demonstrated that short-term dual antiplatelet therapy can reduce recurrent stroke risk in patients with minor ischemic stroke. Guidelines continue to support this approach while underscoring the need for individualized care based on infarct size and associated complications.",

    "explanation": "CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary small vessel disease that typically presents with migraine with aura, recurrent strokes, and cognitive decline. The diagnosis relies on recognizing a combination of clinical features, characteristic MRI findings, and confirmatory genetic testing. CADASIL results from a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene, which leads to abnormal accumulation of granular osmiophilic material in the vascular smooth muscle cells and subsequent degeneration. This process causes progressive white matter changes and subcortical infarcts over time. Patients often present with a triad of migraine (often with aura), recurrent ischemic strokes, and cognitive impairment progressing to dementia. Neuroimaging (MRI) typically shows confluent white matter hyperintensities, particularly in the anterior temporal lobes and external capsules, which is highly suggestive of CADASIL. The diagnostic workup for suspected CADASIL begins with MRI of the brain to look for characteristic white matter changes. Differential diagnoses include sporadic small vessel ischemic disease, multiple sclerosis, and other leukoencephalopathies, but the distinct anterior temporal and external capsule involvement helps differentiate CADASIL. Definitive diagnosis is made by genetic testing for mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. Historically, skin biopsy to detect granular osmiophilic material was used but has been largely supplanted by molecular diagnostics. There is currently no cure for CADASIL; management is largely supportive and focuses on controlling vascular risk factors. Antiplatelet agents (typically low-dose aspirin) may be prescribed for secondary stroke prevention, and migraine management is symptomatic. In pregnancy, risk factor management should be balanced carefully as some medications may not be safe; low-dose aspirin may be continued if indicated. Lactating mothers should be managed similarly with close consultation from specialists, as most treatments are based on symptomatic control and prevention. The correct diagnostic pathway is to perform an MRI brain, which shows characteristic white matter lesions (especially in the anterior temporal lobe and external capsule), followed by genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations to confirm the diagnosis. Option A (assuming it represents this combined approach) is thus correct. Other options, such as CT brain, skin biopsy alone, CSF analysis, or angiography, are either less sensitive or nonspecific and therefore incorrect. \u2022 The combination of migraine with aura, recurrent strokes, and cognitive decline in a patient with a family history should prompt consideration of CADASIL. \u2022 MRI findings of anterior temporal lobe and external capsule involvement are highly specific for CADASIL. \u2022 Genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations remains the gold standard for confirmation. Recent research emphasizes the sensitivity of MRI in identifying CADASIL and supports the use of NOTCH3 genetic testing as definitive. Continued studies are aimed at better understanding the natural history and potential therapeutic targets for this progressive disease.",

    "explanation": "A floating thrombus, as seen on an MRA (magnetic resonance angiography), is a thrombotic lesion that is not fully adherent to the vessel wall and carries a high risk of embolization. It is typically associated with significant arterial stenosis. High-grade stenosis can lead to turbulent blood flow, which predisposes the formation of thrombus. A free-floating thrombus is dangerous because parts of it can dislodge and embolize to distal vascular territories, potentially causing transient ischemic attacks or stroke. Patients may exhibit transient neurological deficits or signs of an acute ischemic event depending on where embolization occurs. The imaging finding of a floating thrombus is considered an emergency due to the risk of stroke from embolic occlusion of distal vessels. Non-invasive imaging such as MRA is often used for vascular evaluation. Differential diagnoses include stable atherosclerotic plaque without thrombus, arterial dissection, or vasculitis. The presence of a mobile component (floating thrombus) differentiates it from a fixed plaque, signaling higher embolic risk. Immediate anticoagulation with a heparin infusion is the usual first-line treatment to prevent further embolization and allow stabilization of the thrombus. This is typically followed by further imaging and consideration for definitive procedures (such as carotid endarterectomy or stenting) once the acute phase is managed. In pregnant patients, unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin is preferred because they do not cross the placenta; similar principles apply while lactating, as these agents are safe. Option A (heparin infusion) is correct because it provides immediate anticoagulation, reducing the risk of thrombus propagation and embolization. Option B (hydrocortisone) is irrelevant for thrombus management. Option C (surgical intervention) may be considered in selected cases and at a later stage once the thrombus is stabilized, and option D (dual or single antiplatelet) does not provide the rapid anticoagulant effect needed in this emergent scenario. \u2022 A free-floating thrombus is an emergent finding that requires prompt anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of distal embolization. \u2022 Heparin infusion is the first-line management in such cases before contemplating surgical or endovascular interventions. \u2022 Always assess for contraindications to anticoagulation in the acute phase. Current literature and guidelines support the initiation of anticoagulation, particularly heparin infusion, as the best initial management for a free-floating carotid thrombus.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Embolic strokes, especially in the elderly, often arise from a cardioembolic source such as atrial fibrillation. Recognizing the stroke mechanism is crucial, as management strategies differ substantially from those for atherothrombotic strokes. In embolic strokes, a clot (often formed in the heart due to conditions like atrial fibrillation or from a cardiac thrombus) dislodges and travels to the cerebral circulation, causing sudden arterial occlusion and ischemia. This process typically leads to infarction in a vascular territory distant from the primary lesion. Patients with cardioembolic strokes usually present with sudden-onset neurological deficits (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia) that can be more severe compared to lacunar strokes. Identifying the embolic source is important, as recurrent embolic events are common without appropriate intervention. Workup includes brain imaging (CT or MRI), cardiac evaluation (ECG, Holter monitoring, echocardiography), and assessment of stroke risk factors. Differential diagnoses include atherothrombotic stroke, lacunar infarcts from small vessel disease, and hemorrhagic stroke. Cardiac investigations help confirm the embolic source. For secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke, anticoagulation is the cornerstone of therapy. Options include warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), with DOACs increasingly preferred in non-valvular atrial fibrillation due to better safety profiles. In pregnancy, warfarin is contraindicated and low molecular weight heparin is preferred. For lactating mothers, warfarin is generally considered safe, but each case should be evaluated individually. The decision to start anticoagulation should follow confirmation of the embolic source to reduce recurrent stroke risk. Option A is correct because initiating anticoagulation directly addresses the thromboembolic source, significantly reducing the risk of recurrent strokes. Options that suggest antiplatelet therapy alone or no treatment are inadequate in preventing further embolic events, as antiplatelets do not provide sufficient protection in cardioembolic stroke. \u2022 Always evaluate for atrial fibrillation in patients with embolic stroke as it is a common and treatable source. \u2022 Anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke recurrence by approximately 60-70% in cardioembolic stroke. \u2022 DOACs have largely supplanted warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation due to their favorable safety profile. Recent guidelines from the American Heart Association and European Stroke Organization support the use of anticoagulation for secondary prevention in cardioembolic strokes, with a growing body of evidence favoring DOACs over warfarin in appropriate patients. Ongoing research continues to optimize treatment strategies in various patient populations, including considerations for pregnancy and lactation.",

    "explanation": "CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary small vessel disease of the brain characterized by migraine (often with aura), recurrent subcortical strokes, and progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia. Its management is predominantly supportive, with emphasis on controlling modifiable vascular risk factors. Mutations in the NOTCH3 gene impair the function of vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to degeneration and thickening of the vessel wall. This results in chronic ischemia, white matter changes, lacunar infarcts, and ultimately, the clinical manifestations of migraine, strokes, and dementia. There is no disease\u2010modifying therapy currently available. Patients typically present with migraine (often with aura), followed by recurrent ischemic strokes and a progressive decline in cognitive function. The history of migraine, stroke, and subsequent vascular dementia in a relatively young patient may suggest CADASIL. Initial evaluation includes a detailed clinical history and brain MRI (which typically shows confluent white matter hyperintensities especially in the anterior temporal lobes). Confirmation is achieved via genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations. Differential diagnoses include other causes of vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis, and other hereditary leukoencephalopathies. There is no curative treatment for CADASIL. Management is centered on controlling modifiable vascular risk factors. First\u2010line recommendations include lifestyle modifications (most importantly, smoking cessation) and blood pressure control. Antiplatelet agents (such as ASA) are sometimes used for secondary stroke prevention, but the evidence in CADASIL is not robust. Anticoagulation is generally avoided due to a higher risk of hemorrhage. In pregnant or lactating patients, careful risk\u2013benefit evaluation of any pharmacotherapy is mandatory, with an emphasis on non\u2010pharmacological risk factor modification. Option A (smoking cessation) is correct because eliminating a modifiable risk factor is paramount in slowing the progression of vascular damage in CADASIL. Option B (anticoagulant/warfarin) is contraindicated as it increases hemorrhagic risks in small vessel arteriopathy. Option C (ASA) is not the first choice given the lack of proven benefit in CADASIL prophylaxis and potential bleeding risks, thus making risk factor modification (i.e. smoking cessation) the preferred approach. 1. CADASIL is a genetic small vessel disease with no specific disease\u2010modifying treatment \u2013 management relies on controlling risk factors. 2. Smoking cessation is critical as smoking exacerbates vascular injury. 3. MRI with anterior temporal lobe involvement is a key radiologic clue to CADASIL. Recent reviews and consensus guidelines emphasize that in genetically mediated small vessel diseases like CADASIL, the most effective strategy is strict risk factor modification rather than relying on antithrombotic therapy.

    "explanation": "This question revisits the management approach in CADASIL, where the clinical picture includes migraine, stroke, and cognitive decline. With CADASIL being a non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic arteriopathy, the management goal is to reduce additional vascular injury. The underlying NOTCH3 mutation leads to vascular smooth muscle dysfunction which causes progressive damage to the small cerebral vessels. This structural abnormality predisposes patients to ischemic events and white matter lesions. Due to the recurring strokes and associated migraine attacks, patients with CADASIL are prone to worsening disability. Prevention of further vascular damage through modification of risk factors is essential since no disease-specific pharmacological treatment exists. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings (migraine with aura, subcortical strokes, and early dementia) along with radiologic evidence on MRI and confirmed by genetic testing. Differential diagnoses include sporadic ischemic stroke and other hereditary leukoencephalopathies. Since there is no curative treatment, the first-line management involves rigorous modification of vascular risk factors. The cornerstone of treatment is lifestyle modification, with smoking cessation being the most critical. Although antiplatelets like ASA are sometimes used, their role is not clearly established in CADASIL, and anticoagulation is generally contraindicated. Management in pregnancy and lactation similarly emphasizes non-pharmacologic interventions to avoid harm to the fetus or neonate. Option A (smoking cessation) is the correct answer as it directly addresses modifiable risk factors to slow disease progression. Option A is consistent with the principles of CADASIL management. The marked answer was C, but given the context from the previous similar question, risk factor modification (specifically smoking cessation) remains the best intervention. The other options (if contemplating anticoagulation or other pharmacologic interventions) do not have evidence to support their use in the prophylaxis of further vascular events in CADASIL. 1. Risk factor modification is the only proven strategy to potentially slow the progression of CADASIL-related vascular damage. 2. Smoking is particularly detrimental in CADASIL. 3. Traditional thrombolytic or anticoagulant therapies have not proven beneficial in this disorder. The latest research continues to support that in CADASIL, aggressive control of modifiable risk factors \u2013 particularly smoking cessation \u2013 is central to management. No randomized clinical trials favor pharmacologic prophylaxis like anticoagulation in this setting, and current guidelines reflect an emphasis on lifestyle management.",

    "explanation": "In acute ischemic stroke management, the decision to administer reperfusion therapies such as intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is based on strict eligibility criteria. A history of a recent stroke is a well-recognized contraindication to thrombolysis. IV tPA works by dissolving clots; however, in brain tissue that has already sustained recent ischemic injury, the blood\u2013brain barrier is compromised. Administering tPA under these circumstances significantly increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation, where damaged vessels are prone to bleeding. In the case presented, an 80-year-old man with a stroke history 2 months prior is now having a new stroke within the therapeutic window. Despite a CT scan showing no acute hemorrhage and evidence of an old cortical insult, the recent stroke is a major red flag, making reperfusion therapy (tPA or tPA plus thrombectomy) a dangerous option. Evaluation includes confirming the stroke timing, reviewing the patient\u2019s history for contraindications (like stroke within the past 3 months), and neuroimaging (CT, MRI) to assess for hemorrhage or infarct evolution. Differential diagnoses such as transient ischemic attack (TIA) and hemorrhagic stroke must be considered and appropriately excluded. First-line treatment for eligible acute ischemic stroke patients is IV tPA administered within the appropriate window, potentially followed by thrombectomy if large vessel occlusion is identified. However, in patients with a recent stroke (within the last 3 months), reperfusion therapies are contraindicated due to the heightened risk of bleeding. In such situations, management shifts to supportive care and secondary prevention strategies. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of tPA involves careful consideration of maternal and fetal risks, with current guidelines generally advising against thrombolysis if contraindications are present. Option A (IV tPA) and Option B (IV tPA followed by thrombectomy) are incorrect because recent stroke (< 3 months) is a contraindication to tPA administration. The marked answer, Option C, though not textually described, is interpreted to mean that thrombolytic therapy should be withheld in this situation, making it the correct choice. 1. A stroke within the past 3 months is a contraindication to tPA due to increased hemorrhagic risk. 2. Always review the patient's recent medical history before considering reperfusion therapies. 3. Advanced age alone is not a contraindication, but accompanying recent stroke is critical. Recent guidelines and updated stroke management protocols underscore that a recent stroke (typically within 3 months) is a contraindication for IV tPA due to the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Ongoing studies and clinical audits consistently support excluding patients with recent strokes from reperfusion therapies, even if they present within the otherwise acceptable time window.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Thrombolytic therapy with tPA is indicated in acute ischemic stroke provided that patients meet strict eligibility criteria. One key contraindication is a recent ischemic event, as the risk of hemorrhagic conversion is significantly increased in recently infarcted brain tissue. After an ischemic stroke, the blood\u2013brain barrier is disrupted. Administering tPA in this vulnerable period (usually within 3 months of a previous stroke) can precipitate bleeding into the damaged brain tissue, leading to hemorrhagic transformation and worse clinical outcomes. In the scenario, the patient had a stroke just 2 months ago and is now presenting with a new ischemic event. This recent history significantly raises the risk of hemorrhagic complications if tPA is administered. Recognizing and adhering to this contraindication is crucial for patient safety. A thorough history is vital to determine the timing of previous strokes. Neuroimaging (CT/MRI) is used to rule out current hemorrhage and to assess brain tissue status. The differential diagnosis may include a new ischemic event versus a hemorrhagic transformation of the previous stroke, making accurate history-taking essential. The standard management principles dictate that in patients with a stroke within the past 3 months, tPA should be withheld. Management then focuses on secondary prevention of stroke, optimization of vascular risk factors, and supportive care. In pregnant or lactating patients, the risk\u2013benefit analysis is even more complex, and conservative management is favored in the presence of contraindications. Option A states that a stroke less than 3 months ago is a (relative) contraindication for tPA, which is correct. Option B is vague with reference to exclusion criteria, and Option C (suggesting thrombectomy benefit) is misleading because the contraindication applies primarily to tPA usage. Therefore, Option A is the best answer. 1. Always confirm the time interval since the last stroke; a stroke within 3 months significantly increases tPA-associated hemorrhagic risk. 2. A thorough medical history is paramount in acute stroke management. 3. Thrombolytic therapy contraindications are strictly adhered to in order to minimize risks. The most recent stroke management guidelines (including those from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association) explicitly list recent stroke (within 3 months) as a contraindication for IV tPA. Recent literature continues to validate this exclusion due to the elevated risk of bleeding, and research is ongoing to better stratify risk in these patients.",
