    "explanation": "Postpartum women are in a hypercoagulable state due to physiological changes of pregnancy and the postpartum period. This increases their risk for venous thromboembolic events, including cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), which can present with headache and focal neurologic deficits. CVT occurs when thrombi form in the cerebral venous sinuses or cortical veins. In the postpartum period, elevated coagulation factors and reduced fibrinolysis predispose to clot formation. Thrombotic occlusion leads to increased venous pressure, disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier, vasogenic edema, and sometimes hemorrhagic venous infarction manifesting as a cortical intracerebral hemorrhage with surrounding edema. A postpartum woman presenting two weeks after delivery with headache and left-sided weakness fits the clinical picture for CVT. The imaging finding of a right cortical intracerebral hemorrhage with surrounding edema is consistent with a hemorrhagic venous infarction secondary to venous sinus thrombosis rather than a typical hypertensive or aneurysmal bleed. The diagnosis typically involves neuroimaging. An MRI combined with MR venography is the modality of choice to detect venous occlusions. Differential diagnoses include aneurysm rupture (which usually causes subarachnoid hemorrhage rather than a cortical hemorrhage) and primary intracerebral hemorrhage from hypertension. The patient\u2019s postpartum status and imaging findings should raise suspicion for CVT. According to current guidelines, the mainstay of CVT treatment is early anticoagulation \u2013 typically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) even when intracerebral hemorrhage is present. In the postpartum period, LMWH is preferred due to its safety profile in lactating women and its predictable pharmacokinetics. Second-line treatments might include unfractionated heparin in cases where rapid reversal might be necessary. Follow\u2010up imaging and long\u2010term anticoagulation duration are individualized based on risk factors. Option A (aneurysm rupture) is unlikely because aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage typically presents with a sudden severe headache and subarachnoid blood on imaging, not a cortical ICH with surrounding edema. Marked Answer B (CVT) is correct given the patient\u2019s postpartum hypercoagulable state and the imaging findings. Options C and D were not provided. 1. The postpartum period is a high-risk time for venous thromboembolic events, including CVT. 2. CVT can cause hemorrhagic venous infarctions, so a hemorrhage on imaging does not preclude the diagnosis. 3. Anticoagulation is indicated for CVT even in the presence of hemorrhage. Recent research and guideline updates (including AHA/ASA recommendations) emphasize early diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulation therapy in CVT. Studies have supported the safety and efficacy of LMWH in postpartum patients, reinforcing its role even when hemorrhagic infarction is present.",

    "question": "75 years old female, DM, HTN who came with acute right side weakness. CTA angiography showed left ICA at 60% and right is 65% what to do",
    "option_a": "Maximize medical management",
    "option_b": "Carotid endarterectomy",
    "option_c": "Elective carotid stenting",
    "option_d": "Stenting within 1 week",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Management of carotid artery disease in the context of stroke is largely driven by the degree of stenosis and symptoms. Surgical interventions like carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are typically reserved for high-grade stenoses in symptomatic individuals. Atherosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid arteries can lead to luminal narrowing. In this patient, the moderate stenosis (60-65%) suggests atherosclerotic disease that has not reached thresholds (generally \u226570% in symptomatic patients) where surgical intervention confers a significant benefit over medical therapy. The elderly patient with vascular risk factors (DM and HTN) presenting with acute right-sided weakness is suggestive for an ischemic stroke. CTA findings showing moderate carotid stenosis indicate that the stroke is more likely due to small vessel or other embolic mechanisms rather than significant carotid artery obstruction warranting surgical revascularization. The diagnostic workup in stroke includes vascular imaging (like CTA or carotid Duplex ultrasound) to assess carotid stenosis. Differential diagnoses include cardioembolic stroke, intracranial atherosclerotic disease, and lacunar strokes. The decision between medical versus surgical management hinges on the degree of stenosis and whether the patient is symptomatic. Current guidelines recommend intensive medical management (antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure control, and lifestyle modifications) as the first-line approach for moderate carotid stenosis. Carotid revascularization (CEA or stenting) is indicated primarily in symptomatic patients with at least 70% stenosis. For a 75-year-old with moderate stenosis and significant comorbidities, maximizing medical therapy is most appropriate. In terms of pregnancy and lactation, this scenario does not apply; however, emphasis on medical management is similarly preferred when surgical risks outweigh benefits. Option A (Maximize medical management) is correct because the stenosis levels (60% and 65%) do not meet the threshold for surgical intervention. Option B (Carotid endarterectomy) and Option C (Elective carotid stenting) are typically reserved for higher-grade stenosis. Option D (Stenting within 1 week) is not appropriate given the degree and the acute setting without severe stenoses. 1. In symptomatic patients, carotid revascularization is generally considered when stenosis is 70% or greater. 2. Intensive medical management is the cornerstone for moderate carotid stenosis. 3. Risk factor modification is critical in stroke prevention. Recent trials and guideline updates (including those from the AHA/ASA and the European Society for Vascular Surgery) support optimal medical therapy for moderate carotid stenosis, highlighting that surgical benefits are most pronounced in patients with high-grade (>70%) stenosis.",

    "question": "Pregnant female patient with positive antiphospholipid who had a stroke was found to have small PFO, and prior history of DVT, what is the next best step",
    "option_a": "Aspirin",
    "option_b": "Close the PFO",
    "option_c": "Heparin",
    "option_d": "Warfarin",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired thrombophilia that predisposes patients to both arterial and venous thrombosis. In pregnant patients, APS poses a significant risk for stroke and recurrent venous thromboembolic events, making anticoagulation the cornerstone of management. APS involves the production of antiphospholipid antibodies (eg, anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant) that interfere with normal coagulation. These antibodies lead to endothelial dysfunction and activation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in both arterial (stroke) and venous (DVT) thrombosis. The presence of a small patent foramen ovale (PFO) is incidental in this context and does not drive the treatment strategy. A pregnant woman with a history of DVT and a positive APS screen who also presents with a stroke strongly suggests that her event is due to hypercoagulability associated with APS. In pregnancy, warfarin is contraindicated owing to its teratogenicity, and PFO closure is not indicated for APS-related strokes. The diagnosis of APS is based on clinical criteria (history of thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity) plus laboratory confirmation (presence of antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions at least 12 weeks apart). Differential considerations include cardioembolic strokes from PFO-related paradoxical embolism; however, the history of DVT and APS positivity points toward a thrombophilic process. For pregnant patients with APS, the current guideline-recommended first-line treatment is the use of heparin \u2013 typically low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) \u2013 often in combination with low-dose aspirin. This regimen is safe during pregnancy and lactation. Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenic effects, and PFO closure is not recommended given that the underlying issue is hypercoagulability rather than an anatomic shunt. Option A (Aspirin) alone is insufficient for a high-risk APS patient with a history of DVT and stroke. Option B (Close the PFO) addresses a potential embolic source but is not indicated when APS is the underlying cause. Option D (Warfarin) is contraindicated in pregnancy. Option C (Heparin) is the correct choice as it effectively anticoagulates the patient while being safe in pregnancy. 1. In pregnant patients with APS, LMWH plus low-dose aspirin is the standard treatment to prevent recurrent thrombosis. 2. A small PFO in an APS patient is likely incidental; focus should be on managing the hypercoagulable state. 3. Warfarin is prohibited during pregnancy due to its known teratogenic risks. Recent studies and updated guidelines (including those from the American College of Rheumatology and obstetrical societies) consistently support the combined use of LMWH and aspirin in pregnant patients with APS to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications.",

    "question": "Stroke within window what should be done before IV tPA.",
    "option_a": "Coagulation",
    "option_b": "Glucose Level",
    "option_c": "ECG",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Before administration of IV tPA for acute ischemic stroke, it is crucial to rule out mimics and contraindications. One of the rapid, bedside tests is the measurement of blood glucose, as hypoglycemia can produce stroke-like symptoms. Hypoglycemia can lead to focal neurological deficits that closely mimic a stroke. Because tPA is a potent thrombolytic agent with significant hemorrhagic risks, it is imperative to ensure that the patient\u2019s symptoms are due to true ischemic stroke rather than a metabolic disturbance. In an acute stroke setting, rapid evaluation is paramount. A fingerstick blood glucose test is easily performed, and abnormal values (too low or too high) must be corrected before considering thrombolytic therapy. This helps prevent unnecessary administration of tPA to patients with stroke mimics. Prior to IV tPA administration, the standard workup includes a non-contrast CT scan to exclude hemorrhage, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose measurement, and assessment of coagulation parameters if indicated (especially in patients on anticoagulants). Differential considerations include hypoglycemia, which can both mimic and worsen neurological deficits. Current guidelines (AHA/ASA) mandate that a bedside blood glucose test be performed in all suspected stroke patients before tPA administration to rule out hypoglycemia. Although coagulation studies and ECG are also important components of the overall stroke workup, the glucose test is rapid and critical in the immediate decision-making process. In pregnancy or lactation, similar protocols are used; however, additional considerations (like radiation exposure from CT) are managed with protective measures. tPA itself is contraindicated in certain pregnancy settings but may be considered in life-threatening strokes with informed risk-benefit discussions. Option A (Coagulation) is important if there is suspicion of a coagulopathy or if the patient is on anticoagulants, but it is not as immediately critical as checking blood glucose. Option C (ECG) is useful for detecting arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation) that might suggest a cardioembolic source but is not a prerequisite for tPA administration. Marked Answer B (Glucose Level) is correct because verifying a normal blood glucose level is a rapid and necessary step to avoid treating a stroke mimic. 1. Always perform a rapid fingerstick blood glucose test in suspected stroke cases before administering tPA. 2. Hypoglycemia can mimic stroke, so its prompt correction is essential. 3. Although additional tests (coagulation studies, ECG) are important, they are secondary to the immediate check of blood glucose in the acute setting. Recent AHA/ASA guidelines reiterate the necessity of checking blood glucose immediately in the acute stroke setting to ensure that the clinical picture is indeed due to ischemia and not a hypoglycemic event. This practice remains a cornerstone in the door-to-needle protocols for IV thrombolysis.",

    "question": "Same picture of Moyamoya in Q12 with right side weakness and CTA showing severe stenosis in the left MCA, what to do next",
    "option_a": "Exchange Transfusion",
    "option_b": "Aspirin and Plavix",
    "option_c": "Labetalol",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Moyamoya syndrome is characterized by progressive steno\u2010occlusive changes in the terminal portions of the internal carotid arteries and their proximal branches. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), a moyamoya pattern may develop as a complication of chronic vaso-occlusive injury. In the acute setting of a stroke with evidence of severe MCA stenosis in an SCD patient, rapid reduction of sickled hemoglobin (HbS) is critical. In SCD, abnormal hemoglobin S leads to red cell sickling under stress conditions. These sickled cells trigger endothelial injury, promoting intimal proliferation and eventual vascular stenosis and occlusion. The moyamoya\u2010like vascular changes, with the formation of fragile collateral vessels, predispose the patient to ischemic events. Urgent reduction of circulating HbS via exchange transfusion improves blood rheology and oxygen delivery, helping to limit infarct size. The patient\u2019s right-sided weakness correlates with left MCA territory ischemia. In the context of a sickle cell patient showing imaging features of moyamoya, the clinical picture is that of an acute ischemic stroke precipitated by vaso-occlusion. Rapid intervention is essential to mitigate further neurologic damage. Diagnosis is typically made with non-invasive imaging such as CTA or MRA to document the stenotic changes. Differential diagnoses include atherosclerotic stroke, vasculitis, or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), but in a young patient with SCD and moyamoya findings, vaso-occlusion is the underlying mechanism. Confirmation of sickle cell status and hemoglobin electrophoresis support the diagnosis. For an acute ischemic stroke in a sickle cell patient with moyamoya-like features, the first-line treatment is urgent exchange transfusion to reduce circulating HbS levels (aiming for <30%). This intervention is critical to arrest further sickling and ischemic injury. Long-term management may include possible revascularization surgery after stabilization and rigorous secondary stroke prevention measures. In pregnant or lactating patients with SCD, exchange transfusion is considered safe with appropriate hematologic consultation and monitoring, as the benefits in reducing ischemic brain injury outweigh potential risks. Option A (Exchange Transfusion) is correct because it directly addresses the acute pathophysiology of sickle cell\u2013related stroke by reducing HbS and improving cerebral perfusion. Option B (Aspirin and Plavix) is more appropriate for atherosclerotic or non\u2013sickle cell embolic strokes and does not address the unique pathophysiology of SCD. Option C (Labetalol) is aimed at blood pressure control and is not the primary acute treatment for sickle cell stroke. \u2022 In SCD patients with stroke, early exchange transfusion can limit infarct expansion.  \u2022 Moyamoya syndrome in SCD warrants careful neuroimaging evaluation.  \u2022 Time is brain \u2013 rapid intervention is essential in vaso-occlusive stroke. Recent guidelines from hematology and stroke societies support early exchange transfusion in SCD patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. Studies have demonstrated that prompt reduction of HbS levels significantly reduces the progression of cerebral infarction, and this approach is endorsed in current SCD management protocols.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In patients with a history of stroke and negative cardiac sources of embolism, the occurrence of chronic epistaxis raises suspicion for an underlying systemic vascular disorder, such as Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is known for its mucocutaneous telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), particularly in the lungs. HHT is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by abnormal blood vessel formation. The presence of pulmonary AVMs can facilitate right-to-left shunting, bypassing the pulmonary capillary filter and predisposing individuals to paradoxical emboli, which can cause ischemic strokes. The use of aspirin may exacerbate bleeding from fragile telangiectasias, worsening epistaxis. This patient\u2019s clinical profile\u2014with a past stroke, a negative cardiac workup, and chronic epistaxis worsened by aspirin\u2014strongly suggests the possibility of pulmonary AVMs secondary to HHT. Identifying a pulmonary AVM is critical since it is a correctable source of cerebral embolism. After a negative cardiac workup, lung angiography (via CT angiography of the chest) is the imaging modality of choice to detect pulmonary AVMs. Important differentials include vasculitides (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis) where C-ANCA could be positive, but the clinical constellation in HHT (recurrent nosebleeds, telangiectasias, and paradoxical embolism) is distinct. The cornerstone of management for pulmonary AVMs involves transcatheter embolization, which can reduce the risk of stroke and brain abscess. In patients with HHT, avoiding medications like aspirin that exacerbate bleeding is important. In pregnant or lactating women with HHT, careful evaluation is warranted as pulmonary AVMs may enlarge during pregnancy; embolization is generally deferred until after the first trimester and coordinated with a multidisciplinary team. Option A (Lung Angiography) is correct because it is the most direct means of detecting pulmonary AVMs that may be responsible for paradoxical embolic stroke. Option B (C-ANCA) would be used for suspected vasculitis (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis) but does not align with a clinical picture dominated by epistaxis and AVM-related stroke. \u2022 In patients with cryptogenic stroke and recurrent epistaxis, think of HHT.  \u2022 Pulmonary AVMs facilitate paradoxical embolism and warrant prompt evaluation.  \u2022 Aspirin can exacerbate bleeding in patients with fragile telangiectasias. Current international consensus guidelines recommend screening for pulmonary AVMs in patients suspected of having HHT, particularly when there is a history of stroke. Emerging research emphasizes the safety and efficacy of endovascular embolization in reducing stroke risk in these patients.",

    "explanation": "CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is an inherited small vessel disease that typically presents with migraine headaches (often with aura), cognitive decline, and a family history of premature stroke. A skin biopsy looking for granular osmiophilic material (eosinophilic inclusions) in the vessel walls is a key diagnostic test. CADASIL is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which leads to abnormal accumulation of the NOTCH3 extracellular domain in vascular smooth muscle cells. These deposits result in progressive degeneration of the small penetrating arteries and arterioles, leading to subcortical infarcts, white matter changes, and ultimately, stroke and cognitive impairment. The presentation of migraine headaches in a patient with a family history of early stroke is highly suggestive of CADASIL. The use of a skin biopsy can reveal the characteristic eosinophilic granular deposits, helping to confirm the diagnosis. While genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations is increasingly used, a skin biopsy remains a reliable diagnostic tool, especially when genetic testing is unavailable or inconclusive. Differential diagnoses include other hereditary small vessel diseases; however, the combination of migraine with aura and a familial pattern strongly points toward CADASIL. Currently, there is no cure for CADASIL and management is primarily supportive, focusing on reducing stroke risk and managing symptoms (e.g., controlling blood pressure, managing migraines). Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin may be used, although their benefit in CADASIL is uncertain. In pregnant or lactating patients, treatment is symptomatic with careful selection of medications that have an acceptable safety profile during pregnancy. Option A (Skin biopsy for eosinophilic inclusions) is correct because it tests for the pathognomonic finding in CADASIL\u2014the granular osmiophilic material. Other options were not provided, but given the clinical context, skin biopsy is the appropriate diagnostic step. \u2022 A family history of early stroke combined with migraine with aura should raise suspicion for CADASIL.  \u2022 Skin biopsy revealing granular osmiophilic material is a hallmark of CADASIL.  \u2022 Early recognition is important for counseling and management, even though disease-specific treatment remains limited. Recent advances emphasize the role of genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations; however, skin biopsy continues to be a valuable diagnostic adjunct. Ongoing research is investigating therapies that might modify the disease course, but current management remains supportive.",

    "explanation": "Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT) is a form of stroke caused by thrombosis in the cerebral venous sinuses. The postpartum period is a high-risk state for thrombosis due to a transient hypercoagulable state. After childbirth, hormonal changes and a hypercoagulable state predispose patients to thrombus formation within the cerebral venous system. This can lead to impaired venous drainage, increased intracranial pressure, and venous infarction or hemorrhage. Patients with CVT may present with severe headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, or signs of raised intracranial pressure. In postpartum patients, CVT should be high on the differential when these symptoms arise. The diagnostic imaging of choice for CVT is CT Venography (CTV) or MR Venography (MRV). CTV is widely available, quick, and highly sensitive in detecting venous sinus thrombosis, making it a reasonable first-line diagnostic tool. Differential diagnoses include arterial stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and benign postdural puncture headache, but the clinical scenario and imaging findings help clarify the diagnosis. Management of CVT generally involves prompt initiation of anticoagulation (typically with low molecular weight heparin) even in the presence of hemorrhagic infarct. In postpartum patients, anticoagulation is safe and effective, and lactation is not a contraindication. Subsequent treatment may involve transition to oral anticoagulants for a duration guided by risk factors and recurrence risk. Multidisciplinary management including neurology and hematology is important. For breastfeeding mothers, LMWH is preferred due to minimal secretion in breast milk. Option A (CTV) is correct because CT Venography is a standard, accessible, and highly accurate imaging modality for diagnosing CVT. Other options (such as MRV) may be used but were not provided here, and the given option A is appropriate for initial evaluation. \u2022 The postpartum period is a well-recognized risk factor for CVT.  \u2022 Early diagnosis via CT Venography can significantly improve outcomes by facilitating early anticoagulation.  \u2022 Anticoagulation is indicated even if a hemorrhagic component is present. Recent guidelines consistently support the use of CTV for rapid diagnosis of CVT. Anticoagulation (with LMWH transitioning to oral agents) remains the mainstay of treatment, and studies have validated its safety in the postpartum and lactating populations.",

    "explanation": "After a cardiac arrest\u2014especially in a smoker complicated by hypotension and requiring intubation\u2014the brain undergoes a period of global ischemia. The subsequent delayed neurological complaints such as chronic headaches and dizziness are most consistent with a hypoxic-ischemic injury rather than acute derangements like hypercapnia or vascular phenomena like vasospasm. During cardiac arrest, cerebral blood flow ceases, leading to widespread neuronal hypoxia. Hypotension exacerbates this effect, and upon resuscitation, reperfusion injury (with production of free radicals and inflammatory mediators) may occur. This results in delayed neuronal death and white matter changes\u2014phenomena that are part of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy. Neither hypercapnia (which is an acute effect due to ventilation issues) nor vasospasm (more typically linked with subarachnoid hemorrhage) explains the delayed symptom picture in this patient. Patients recovering from cardiac arrest can develop chronic neurological deficits. In this case, persistent headache and dizziness a month later suggest that the brain suffered an ischemic insult with subsequent reperfusion injury. Such deficits are aligned with the areas of the brain that are most vulnerable to low oxygen states. The evaluation of post-cardiac arrest patients with chronic neurological symptoms usually involves brain imaging (MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging can reveal watershed or diffuse white matter changes) and sometimes EEG.

    "explanation": "In acute ischemic stroke management, the overall goal is to restore perfusion and prevent further ischemic injury. The treatment choice depends on factors including the time window, stroke severity measured by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and whether deficits are disabling. A NIHSS of 3 generally indicates a minor stroke, and if the deficits are non\u2010disabling, aggressive thrombolytic therapy may not be warranted. Ischemic strokes occur from occlusion of cerebral arteries leading to brain tissue ischemia. In mild strokes, the clot may be smaller, and collateral circulation may limit the extent of injury. The risk in these patients is not only the initial infarct but also early recurrent events. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) works by inhibiting platelet aggregation, thereby reducing the chance of clot extension or new embolic events. Patients with a minor stroke (NIHSS 3) often present with subtle neurological deficits that do not significantly impair function. In such cases, intravenous thrombolysis (tPA) is not automatically indicated unless even a minor deficit is considered disabling. DAPT is favored in non\u2010disabling minor strokes to reduce the risk of early recurrence. Diagnosis begins with prompt neuroimaging (often a non\u2010contrast CT scan) to rule out hemorrhage, followed by vascular imaging as needed. Differential diagnoses include transient ischemic attack (TIA), migraine, and seizure-related deficits. The clinical context and imaging help distinguish these conditions from an ischemic stroke. First-line management for acute ischemic stroke within the treatment window involves IV tPA in patients with disabling deficits. However, for minor, non-disabling strokes (NIHSS 3 and not functionally impairing), the current evidence supports the use of DAPT (commonly aspirin plus clopidogrel) for early secondary prevention. Thrombectomy is reserved for large vessel occlusions. In the context of pregnancy or lactation, aspirin is generally considered safe, although clopidogrel data are limited and should be used if the benefits outweigh the risks. Option A (DAPT) is correct for non-disabling minor strokes. Option B (TPA) is recommended for patients with disabling symptoms irrespective of stroke severity; however, in a minor, non-disabling stroke, the risks of thrombolysis may outweigh the benefits. Option C (Thrombectomy) is reserved for large vessel occlusion strokes and is not indicated in a minor stroke with an NIHSS of 3. 1) In minor, non-disabling strokes, careful assessment is needed to decide against thrombolysis even when within the window. 2) Short-term use of DAPT has been shown to reduce early recurrence in minor stroke. 3) The decision-making must incorporate both the NIHSS and the functional impact of the deficits. Recent trials such as CHANCE and POINT have demonstrated the benefit of short-term DAPT in reducing recurrent stroke in patients with minor, non-disabling ischemic strokes, influencing current guideline recommendations to personalize therapy based on the functional impact rather than solely on the NIHSS score.",

    "explanation": "Carotid artery dissection, particularly of the internal carotid artery (ICA), is a common cause of stroke in younger patients. It results from a tear in the arterial wall, leading to the formation of an intramural hematoma and risk of thromboembolism. The standard approach in the acute setting is to prevent thromboembolic complications using medical therapy. Dissection involves a tear in the intimal layer of the artery, allowing blood to enter the vessel wall which creates a false lumen. This can lead to luminal stenosis and an increased risk of thrombus formation, which may embolize and cause cerebral infarction. The main goal of treatment is to prevent further thromboembolic events. Patients with ICA dissection often present with ipsilateral headache, Horner\u2019s syndrome, or neck pain, and may develop neurological deficits (such as contralateral weakness) due to cerebral ischemia caused by emboli. Recognizing the dissection early is key to preventing stroke progression. Diagnosis is typically established by imaging modalities such as CT angiography or MRI/MRA. Differential diagnoses include atherosclerotic disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, and other vasculopathies. The imaging findings along with clinical presentation help confirm the diagnosis of arterial dissection. First-line management for ICA dissection is medical therapy using either antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation. Current evidence, including the CADISS trial, has not shown a significant difference in outcomes between the two modalities. The selection depends on individual patient risks and contraindications. Endovascular interventions such as stenting or angioplasty are reserved for cases that fail medical management or in which there is ongoing ischemia. In pregnancy and lactation, heparin (as unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin) is generally preferred due to its safety profile. Option C (Medical therapy) is the correct initial treatment for acute carotid artery dissection. Option A (Stenting) and Option B (Angioplasty) are invasive procedures generally considered in refractory cases or if there is significant luminal compromise causing ongoing ischemia, but they are not first-line treatments. 1) Early diagnosis of carotid dissection is essential to prevent thromboembolic stroke. 2) Both antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies are viable first-line options. 3) Endovascular interventions are considered only if medical therapy fails. Recent research, including the CADISS trial, has supported the use of medical management (either antiplatelet or anticoagulation) in carotid dissection, with similar efficacy in preventing recurrent ischemic events. This evidence underpins current therapeutic guidelines.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high risk for ischemic stroke due to the abnormal morphology of red blood cells leading to vascular occlusion and endothelial damage. For secondary prevention in SCD patients who have experienced a stroke, reducing the proportion of sickled red blood cells is key. In SCD, the abnormal hemoglobin S polymerizes under conditions of low oxygen tension, causing red blood cells to sickle. These sickled cells can obstruct microvasculature and cause endothelial injury, which results in a prothrombotic state and predisposes to stroke. Chronic transfusion therapy reduces the proportion of hemoglobin S by diluting it with normal hemoglobin, thereby mitigating these risks. SCD patients with a history of strokes typically present with recurrent neurological deficits and other complications of vaso-occlusion. Stroke prevention is a major component of the overall management strategy in SCD to reduce mortality and morbidity. Evaluation includes neuroimaging (MRI, MRA) to assess for prior infarcts and ongoing cerebrovascular disease, as well as transcranial Doppler ultrasound screening in children with SCD. Differential diagnoses include transient ischemic attack (TIA) and silent cerebral infarcts, which are common in SCD. Chronic red blood cell transfusion is the first-line preventive strategy for secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD. The goal is to maintain the percentage of hemoglobin S below 30% to lower the risk of recurrent strokes. First-line management includes regular transfusion regimens with appropriate iron chelation to prevent iron overload. Aspirin or anticoagulation is not considered sufficient for stroke prevention in these patients. In pregnancy and lactation, chronic transfusion plans are continued with careful monitoring of iron levels and fetal well-being, as transfusions are generally considered safe. Option A (Chronic transfusion) is correct as it is the standard of care for preventing recurrent strokes in SCD. Option B (Aspirin) and Option C (Anticoagulation) do not address the underlying pathophysiology of sickling and are not recommended as primary preventive strategies in this population. 1) Maintaining hemoglobin S levels below target thresholds is crucial for stroke prevention in SCD. 2) Iron overload is an important complication to monitor in patients on chronic transfusion therapy. 3) Regular neurovascular screening is recommended in children with SCD to preemptively address stroke risk. Recent guidelines from hematology societies underscore the importance of chronic transfusion therapy for secondary stroke prevention in SCD. Emerging research is also examining the roles of hydroxyurea and stem cell transplantation, but chronic transfusions remain the cornerstone of management for patients with prior strokes.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction is characterized by a large territory stroke that leads to significant cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and often, midline brain shift. Timely surgical intervention can be life-saving in these cases. Massive infarction in the MCA territory leads to cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. As the swelling increases, intracranial pressure rises, potentially resulting in brain herniation. Decompressive hemicraniectomy (or craniectomy) is performed to physically allow the swollen brain tissue to expand, thereby reducing intracranial pressure and preventing fatal herniation. Patients with malignant MCA infarction typically have rapidly deteriorating neurological function, and imaging may reveal a large infarct with significant edema and midline shift. If not promptly managed, these patients are at high risk for herniation and death. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and neuroimaging (CT/MRI) showing extensive infarction involving the MCA territory, significant cerebral edema, and midline shift. Differential diagnoses include large hemorrhagic strokes and other causes of cerebral edema, but the context of infarction guides the diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is decompressive hemicraniectomy. First-line management involves early surgical intervention, ideally within 48 hours of stroke onset, as studies have demonstrated improved survival and functional outcomes. Supportive care in a stroke unit is also essential, but in the presence of significant midline shift and malignant edema, prompt decompressive surgery takes precedence. In pregnancy and lactation, decompressive craniectomy is similarly indicated when life-threatening cerebral edema is present; however, multidisciplinary collaboration including obstetrics is needed to balance maternal and fetal risks. Option A (Decompressive craniectomy) is the correct and most urgent intervention in malignant MCA syndrome with midline shift. Option B (Admission to stroke unit) is important for supportive care, but it does not address the life-threatening increase in intracranial pressure. In this emergency setting, surgical decompression is critical. 1) Decompressive surgery should be performed within 48 hours of stroke onset for optimal outcomes in malignant MCA infarction. 2) Rapid identification of cerebral edema and midline shift on imaging is crucial. 3) Multidisciplinary care is essential, especially in special populations such as pregnant patients. Recent randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses support early decompressive hemicraniectomy in reducing mortality and improving outcomes in malignant MCA infarction. Guidelines continue to endorse surgical decompression in patients with significant midline shift, even when presentation is beyond the very early hours, provided the window (usually up to 48 hours) is respected.",

    "explanation": "The Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA) supplies portions of the superior cerebellum and parts of the rostral brainstem. Infarction or pathology in this vascular territory can affect both cerebellar structures and adjacent midbrain areas including cranial nerve nuclei or their fiber tracts. Ischemia in the SCA territory may extend to parts of the midbrain where the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV) courses near the dorsal aspect. Disruption of blood flow can lead to infarction of these areas and result in an ipsilateral fourth nerve palsy. In contrast, symptoms such as Horner\u2019s syndrome (ptosis with miosis) are more characteristic of lesions affecting the lateral medulla (PICA territory) or sympathetic pathways. Patients with SCA involvement typically present with cerebellar signs like ataxia and dysmetria. When the infarct affects adjacent midbrain regions, additional findings like an ipsilateral fourth nerve palsy (leading to vertical diplopia or difficulty with downward gaze) can occur. Diagnosis is established with neuroimaging such as MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging and MR angiography to delineate the vascular territory. Differential diagnoses include lateral medullary syndrome (which may present with ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome), and other brainstem or cerebellar strokes. Careful evaluation of clinical signs coupled with imaging findings helps differentiate these entities. Acute management follows ischemic stroke guidelines including rapid neuroimaging, possible thrombolysis if within the therapeutic window, and secondary prevention measures (antiplatelet agents, control of risk factors). If there is extension into brainstem regions, supportive care and monitoring in a stroke unit are essential. In pregnant and lactating patients, decisions regarding thrombolysis require balancing maternal and fetal risks, but protocols exist to guide safe management. Option A (Ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome/ptosis) is more typical of lateral medullary (PICA) infarcts affecting sympathetic fibers. Option B (Ipsilateral fourth nerve palsy) reflects involvement of midbrain areas near the SCA territory, making it the more appropriate answer in this context. 1. SCA infarcts classically present with cerebellar ataxia and may include ocular motor deficits when adjacent midbrain structures are involved. 2. Horner\u2019s syndrome is usually seen with lesions in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) distribution. 3. Detailed neuroimaging is essential to appropriately localize posterior circulation strokes. Recent literature emphasizes the importance of early multimodal imaging in posterior circulation strokes to direct acute management. Guidelines continue to support thrombolytic therapy following strict criteria, and emerging evidence highlights the role of endovascular techniques in select cases.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Moyamoya syndrome is characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion of the terminal portions of the internal carotid arteries, with the formation of a network of fragile collateral vessels. This chronic process predisposes patients to ischemic strokes and, less commonly, hemorrhagic events. The progressive narrowing of major intracranial arteries leads to reduced cerebral perfusion. The compensatory development of collateral vessels (which appear as a \u201cpuff of smoke\u201d on angiography) is often insufficient to meet metabolic demands. This mismatch predisposes patients to recurrent ischemic events. The definitive treatment addresses the hemodynamic compromise by surgically improving cerebral blood flow through revascularization. Patients with Moyamoya syndrome often present with transient ischemic attacks or strokes, and may have a history of prior ischemic events. Ischemic symptoms, such as weakness or speech difficulties, are common. The risk of future stroke remains high without definitive intervention. Diagnosis is confirmed with imaging such as MRI/MRA or conventional angiography, which reveals the characteristic vasculature. Differential diagnoses include other causes of intracranial arterial stenosis (e.g., atherosclerosis, vasculitis) and genetic conditions that predispose to stroke. Characteristic findings on angiography help differentiate Moyamoya from these other conditions. The primary treatment to prevent future stroke in Moyamoya is surgical revascularization. First-line surgical options include direct bypass (e.g., superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery [STA-MCA] bypass) or indirect revascularization procedures (e.g., encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis [EDAS]). Medical management with antiplatelets may be used as an adjunct or bridge while awaiting surgery, but is not sufficient on its own. In patients with sickle cell disease\u2013associated Moyamoya, chronic transfusion therapy may be considered, but this is not typical for non\u2013sickle cell Moyamoya. In pregnancy and lactation, surgical procedures are approached with caution; if indicated, a multidisciplinary team should evaluate the timing and risk, with medical therapy (including low-dose aspirin) possibly used during gestation under close monitoring. Option A (Chronic transfusion) is primarily used in sickle cell disease\u2013associated stroke prevention, not in primary Moyamoya syndrome. Option B (Aspirin and clopidogrel) suggests dual antiplatelet therapy, which is not the standard definitive treatment for Moyamoya. Option C, presumed to stand for surgical revascularization, is the best treatment to prevent future strokes in this context. 1. Surgical revascularization is the treatment of choice for prevention of recurrent stroke in Moyamoya syndrome. 2. Moyamoya should be suspected in patients (especially in children and young adults) with recurrent ischemic events and characteristic angiographic findings. 3. Comprehensive management may require coordination across neurology, neurosurgery, and, when relevant, hematology (in sickle cell disease). Recent guidelines and studies from stroke and neurosurgical societies continue to support early revascularization in symptomatic Moyamoya to improve long\u2010term outcomes. Advances in surgical techniques and perioperative care have further optimized outcomes in both pediatric and adult populations.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Patients on warfarin are at risk for hemorrhagic complications due to its anticoagulant effect. Warfarin interferes with the synthesis of vitamin K dependent clotting factors, predisposing patients to bleeding. Warfarin-induced coagulopathy leads to impaired clot formation. In the event of intracranial bleeding, the lack of effective coagulation can result in blood layering, creating a fluid\u2013fluid level on CT imaging. The fluid level signifies that the blood components have separated due to inadequate clot stabilization. A patient on warfarin who develops sudden weakness and is found to have intracranial bleeding on CT should raise suspicion for a coagulopathy-induced hemorrhage. The presence of a fluid level on imaging supports the diagnosis of a bleeding diathesis rather than a typical hemorrhagic stroke resulting solely from hypertension. CT imaging is the first modality to assess intracranial hemorrhage. Laboratory tests including PT/INR are critical to evaluate the degree of anticoagulation. Differential diagnoses include hypertensive hemorrhage and hemorrhagic conversion of an ischemic stroke; however, the fluid level is particularly suggestive of a coagulopathic bleed as seen with warfarin over-anticoagulation. Management involves rapid reversal of warfarin\u2019s effects using vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrates (or fresh frozen plasma, if PCC is unavailable). Blood pressure control and supportive care are also essential. In pregnancy and lactation, reversal agents must be used cautiously; for example, vitamin K is generally safe, but FFP and PCC should be administered with considerations for both maternal and fetal health. Monitoring of coagulation parameters following reversal is critical. Option A (Coagulopathy) is correct because warfarin causes a bleeding diathesis leading to intracranial hemorrhage with characteristic imaging findings. The other options (B, C, D) are either not provided or are less likely to explain the CT fluid level seen in this scenario. 1. Warfarin\u2019s anticoagulant effect increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, often with a characteristic fluid\u2013fluid level on CT due to poor clot formation. 2. Always verify coagulation parameters (INR/PT) in patients on warfarin presenting with new neurological symptoms. 3. Rapid reversal of anticoagulation is crucial to minimize further bleeding complications. Recent evidence emphasizes the use of PCC for rapid warfarin reversal, with updated guidelines advocating for tailored reversal strategies based on the severity of bleeding and INR levels. Studies continue to refine the risk/benefit profiles of various reversal agents, especially in patients with concurrent comorbidities.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "The internal capsule, particularly its posterior limb, is a compact area where corticospinal and corticobulbar fibers converge. A lesion here can produce a contralateral, often complete, motor deficit affecting the face, arm, and leg. A lacunar infarct or other small vessel occlusion in the internal capsule damages the densely packed motor fibers, leading to pure motor hemiparesis. The involvement of corticobulbar fibers can also result in mild dysarthria (articulation difficulties). Patients presenting with weakness affecting the contralateral face, arm, and leg, along with slight speech articulation problems, are classic for an internal capsule lesion. There is typically no significant sensory deficit, which helps differentiate it from strokes involving other areas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scans are used to localize the infarct. Differential diagnoses include middle cerebral artery (MCA) strokes, which often produce additional cortical signs, and brainstem strokes, which can also produce lower cranial nerve involvement. The pure motor pattern favors a lacunar infarct in the internal capsule. Acute management involves standard ischemic stroke protocols, including consideration of thrombolytic therapy if within the window period and secondary prevention with antiplatelet agents and risk factor modification. In pregnant or lactating patients, management of stroke follows established protocols with particular attention to medication safety (e.g., aspirin is generally considered safe in low doses; thrombolysis can be considered if benefits outweigh risks). Long-term management focuses on controlling vascular risk factors to prevent recurrence. Option A (Internal capsule) is correct because it best accounts for the presentation of pure motor deficits involving the face, arm, and leg with mild dysarthria. Option B (Midbrain) is less likely because midbrain lesions often involve additional cranial nerve deficits or altered consciousness, which are not described here. 1. The classic \u201cpure motor stroke\u201d syndrome is most commonly due to a lacunar infarct in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. 2. Small, deep infarcts often occur in patients with chronic vascular risk factors like hypertension and diabetes. 3. Rapid imaging and risk factor control are key to optimizing outcomes in lacunar strokes. Current stroke guidelines emphasize early identification and management of lacunar strokes, with studies supporting intensive risk factor modification to reduce the risk of recurrent events. Research into advanced imaging techniques continues to improve our ability to localize small deep infarcts.",
