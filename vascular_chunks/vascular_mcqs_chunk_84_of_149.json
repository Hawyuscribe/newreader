Her brother and sister has similar complain. Genetic study for the family revealed positive SMN1 gene mutation.\nWhich of the following will correspond to the patient diagnosis?",
    "option_a": "Abnormal pulmonary function test.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This case describes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder characterized by degeneration of anterior horn cells. The SMN1 gene mutation is the hallmark of SMA, leading to motor neuron loss and subsequent muscle weakness. In SMA, loss-of-function mutations in the SMN1 gene result in insufficient production of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. This protein deficiency leads to progressive degeneration of the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord, causing denervation of muscles. The resulting neurogenic atrophy is reflected by characteristic findings on electrophysiologic studies. Patients usually present with symmetric, proximal muscle weakness causing difficulty in walking or climbing stairs. Normal lifestyle function in early or milder cases is common, and a family history (especially in a consanguineous setting) supports an inherited lower motor neuron disorder. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, family history, EMG studies showing neurogenic changes, and genetic testing (demonstrating SMN1 gene mutation). Differential diagnoses include muscular dystrophies (which show myopathic changes on EMG), inflammatory myopathies, and motor neuron diseases with mixed UMN and LMN features (e.g., ALS) which typically include brisk reflexes. Management is primarily supportive. Newer therapies include disease-modifying agents such as nusinersen, risdiplam, and onasemnogene abeparvovec. In adult patients or those planning pregnancy/lactation, careful counseling is needed. For instance, nusinersen\u2014administered intrathecally\u2014has been used in a broad age range, but risks and benefits should be discussed with women who are pregnant or lactating, as data are evolving. Option A (Abnormal pulmonary function test) can be seen in advanced cases due to respiratory muscle weakness, but it is not a primary diagnostic test for SMA. Option B (Neurogenic change in EMG) is correct, as EMG findings in SMA reveal decreased recruitment, fibrillations, and other neurogenic features. 1) SMA presents with proximal muscle weakness and difficulty with stairs or walking. 2) A positive SMN1 mutation confirms the diagnosis. 3) EMG demonstrating neurogenic changes reinforces the diagnosis of a lower motor neuronopathy. Recent advances highlight the role of gene-modifying agents in SMA management. Studies continue to validate the benefit of early administration of medications like nusinersen, which have been shown to improve motor function and slow disease progression across various age groups.",

    "question": "A 40-year-old male presented to the outpatient clinic with history of progressive bilateral upper and lower limbs proximal weakness. No cranial nerve or bulbar symptoms. No other systemic symptoms. On examination there is muscle tenderness but no skin manifestation. Lab investigations showed CK of 40,000. Muscle biopsy showed perifascicular atrophy.\nWhich antibody is associated with the patient diagnosis?",
    "option_a": "Anti-HMGCR",
    "option_b": "Anti Jo-1",
    "option_c": "Anti- Mi",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This case is most consistent with dermatomyositis, an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy typically affecting proximal muscles. Although skin involvement is common, cases can present with minimal or absent cutaneous features, sometimes referred to as clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis involves immune-mediated injury possibly triggered by a microangiopathy that results in muscle fiber damage, especially in the perifascicular region. The deposition of complement and inflammatory mediators leads to ischemia and atrophy in the affected muscle fibers. Patients generally present with progressive proximal muscle weakness. Extremely elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, such as a value of 40,000 IU/L, support significant muscle injury. The biopsy showing perifascicular atrophy is a classical finding associated with dermatomyositis, even in the absence of obvious skin findings. In addition to clinical presentation and markedly elevated CK, diagnostic steps include EMG studies, muscle biopsy (demonstrating perifascicular atrophy), and serologic assessments for myositis-specific antibodies. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis (which lacks perifascicular atrophy), necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (often associated with anti-HMGCR), and antisynthetase syndrome (associated with anti-Jo-1). First-line management typically involves high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone). If patients do not respond adequately, second-line immunosuppressive agents (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine) may be introduced. In cases of pregnancy or lactation, corticosteroids are generally considered relatively safe when used judiciously, but immunosuppressants require careful risk-benefit assessment and often avoidance or dose adjustment. Option A (Anti-HMGCR) is associated with necrotizing autoimmune myopathy, particularly in patients with statin exposure. Option B (Anti Jo-1) is linked with antisynthetase syndrome, which frequently features interstitial lung disease and mechanic\u2019s hands. Option C (Anti Mi-2) is the correct antibody, classically associated with dermatomyositis, especially in patients with prominent muscle involvement and characteristic biopsy findings. 1) Perifascicular atrophy on biopsy is a strong histopathologic marker for dermatomyositis. 2) The anti-Mi-2 antibody is highly specific for dermatomyositis. 3) Even in the absence of dramatic skin findings, dermatomyositis should be considered in patients with severe muscle weakness and very high CK levels. Recent guidelines continue to support the use of corticosteroids as the first-line treatment for dermatomyositis, with adjunct immunosuppressive therapy for refractory cases. There is also ongoing research into the role of biologic agents targeting specific immune pathways in inflammatory myopathies.",

    "question": "A 50-year-old male patient complaining of chronic progressive bilateral ptosis associated with difficulty swallowing, and difficulty speech. On physical examination, he has mild weakness over shoulder and pelvic muscles bilaterally. Muscle biopsy: Internuclear tubular filaments.\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "option_a": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.",
    "option_b": "External progressive ophthalmoplegia.",
    "option_c": "Kearns Sayer syndrome.",
    "option_d": "Myotonia congenia",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation of progressive bilateral ptosis, dysphagia, and mild proximal muscle weakness in a middle-aged adult is strongly suggestive of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), a genetic disorder that typically follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. OPMD is caused by a short expansion of a polyalanine tract in the PABPN1 gene, leading to the accumulation of intranuclear inclusions. Electron microscopy often reveals internuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions, which are considered a pathological hallmark of the disease. Common clinical features of OPMD include slowly progressive ptosis, difficulty swallowing, and sometimes mild proximal limb weakness. The age of onset is typically in the 5th or 6th decade, although variability exists. The biopsy finding of internuclear tubular filaments further supports the diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, detailed family history, muscle biopsy (ideally with electron microscopy to detect intranuclear inclusions), and confirmatory genetic testing for PABPN1 mutations. Differential diagnoses include external ophthalmoplegia due to mitochondrial disorders (which also features other systemic involvement), Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome (a mitochondrial myopathy with multisystem involvement), and myotonia congenita (characterized by muscle stiffness and myotonia). There is no definitive cure for OPMD; management is largely supportive. Treatment focuses on symptom relief and may involve surgical correction of ptosis and interventions for dysphagia (such as dietary modifications or in severe cases, gastrostomy). In pregnancy and lactation, surgical timing and supportive nutritional measures should be carefully planned in consultation with multidisciplinary teams. Option A (Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy) is the correct answer given the classic constellation of ptosis, dysphagia, and the biopsy findings (intranuclear tubular filaments). Option B (External progressive ophthalmoplegia) is typically linked to mitochondrial disorders with predominant extraocular muscle involvement. Option C (Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome) is a mitochondrial cytopathy with multisystem features including retinal pigmentary changes and conduction defects, which are not present here. Option D (Myotonia congenita) is characterized by muscle stiffness and myotonia, features absent in this case. 1) OPMD most commonly presents with ptosis and dysphagia in middle-aged adults. 2) Internuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions on muscle biopsy are highly suggestive of OPMD. 3) A positive family history with autosomal dominant inheritance should prompt consideration of OPMD. Current research emphasizes the importance of genetic confirmation in suspected cases of OPMD and supports a multidisciplinary approach to manage complications. While disease-modifying therapies are not yet available, ongoing trials continue to explore potential molecular targets.",

Physical examination showed mild weakness in shoulder abduction bilaterally, lower limbs weakness bilaterally (cannot recall distribution), Reflexes were depressed in knee and ankle bilaterally, EMG: showed lower limbs fibrillation.

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This patient\u2019s presentation of slowly progressive, predominantly proximal muscle weakness with a positive family history and EMG findings of fibrillations suggests a hereditary lower motor neuron disorder, most consistent with a form of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), especially the adult-onset variant. In SMA, mutations (typically in the SMN1 gene) lead to reduced levels of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, resulting in degeneration of anterior horn cells. The subsequent denervation of muscle fibers is responsible for the clinical symptoms and the fibrillations seen on EMG. The characteristic clinical picture includes difficulty with activities like climbing stairs and rising from a chair. The presence of a family history and depressed deep tendon reflexes further support a lower motor neuron pathology. EMG findings such as fibrillation potentials are typical of denervation processes seen in SMA. Beyond the clinical evaluation and electromyographic findings, confirmatory genetic testing for SMN1 gene mutations is essential. Differential diagnoses include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which involves both upper and lower motor neuron signs, and inflammatory neuropathies, which have different electrophysiological and clinical profiles. The management of SMA has been revolutionized by the development of disease-modifying therapies. Nusinersen is a first-line treatment that modulates the splicing of SMN2 to increase production of functional SMN protein. Other therapies include risdiplam and onasemnogene abeparvovec (the latter being primarily used in pediatric patients). In the context of pregnancy or lactation, although data in adults are limited, the risk/benefit ratio should be discussed comprehensively with the patient. In such cases, multidisciplinary consultation with neurology and maternal\u2013fetal medicine specialists is advised. Option A (Riluzole) is primarily used for ALS, which typically presents with mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs rather than isolated lower motor neuron features. Option B (Corticosteroid) is used for inflammatory myopathies, not for genetically-mediated motor neuron disorders. Option C (Nusinersen) is the correct choice, as it is specifically approved for the treatment of 5q SMA via an antisense mechanism to enhance SMN protein production. 1) Adult-onset SMA can present with slowly progressive proximal weakness and is often familial. 2) EMG showing fibrillations and other features of denervation is supportive of an SMA diagnosis. 3) Nusinersen is a disease-modifying treatment that has significantly altered the management landscape for SMA. Recent studies and updated guidelines confirm that nusinersen improves motor function and slows disease progression in various SMA phenotypes, including adult-onset cases. Ongoing research continues to optimize dosing regimens and to monitor long-term safety, with particular attention to its use in special populations such as pregnant or breastfeeding patients.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is an acute postinfectious polyneuropathy typically triggered by a recent infection. It is characterized by rapidly progressive, symmetrical, ascending weakness with diminished or absent reflexes. The classic form, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), is the most common variant in Western countries. GBS is mediated by an autoimmune response that, through molecular mimicry, attacks peripheral nerve components\u2014primarily the myelin sheath. This immune attack results in demyelination of the peripheral nerves, disrupting saltatory conduction and leading to conduction block. Though there are axonal variants (e.g., AMAN and AMSAN), the demyelinating form remains the typical pathophysiology in most cases. Clinically, patients often present with a history of a preceding infection (such as pharyngitis, gastrointestinal, or respiratory infections) followed by rapidly progressive limb weakness that ascends from the feet upward. Bulbar involvement can lead to dysphagia and changes in voice. Areflexia is almost universally present. Diagnosis is clinical and is supported by investigations: cerebrospinal fluid analysis often shows albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein with normal cell counts), and nerve conduction studies reveal slowed conduction velocities and conduction block. Differential diagnoses include myasthenia gravis (neuromuscular junction disorder), botulism (toxin-mediated inhibition of acetylcholine release), and central nervous system lesions. First-line treatments include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasmapheresis, which have been shown to reduce morbidity. Supportive care, including respiratory monitoring and intensive care unit admission if needed, is critical. In pregnancy and lactation, IVIG is generally considered safe and is the preferred treatment when GBS occurs in these populations. Option A (Peripheral demyelination) correctly identifies the mechanism underlying the most common form of GBS (AIDP). Option B (ALS) denotes a chronic neurodegenerative condition with a very different clinical course. Options C and D describe neuromuscular junction disorders (botulism and myasthenia gravis, respectively), which present with different clinical and electrophysiological findings. \u2022 GBS typically follows a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. \u2022 The classic finding of albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF is highly suggestive of GBS. \u2022 Early initiation of IVIG or plasmapheresis is crucial to prevent life\u2010threatening complications such as respiratory failure. Recent guidelines emphasize early detection and intervention in GBS to improve outcomes. Research is ongoing into biomarkers that may predict disease severity and treatment responsiveness. Updated protocols continue to support IVIG and plasmapheresis as first-line treatments, including modifications for use in special populations such as pregnant patients.",

    "question": "What is the most common deficit occur post elbow joint trauma?",
    "option_a": "Wrist drop",
    "option_b": "Claw hand",
    "option_c": "Cheralgia Paraesthetica",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Peripheral nerve injuries at the level of the elbow are frequent due to the vulnerable anatomic course of several nerves around the joint. In particular, the ulnar nerve is susceptible because it runs in a superficial groove behind the medial epicondyle. Trauma to the elbow, such as a fracture or dislocation, can injure the ulnar nerve as it passes posterior to the medial epicondyle. Damage to this nerve leads to denervation of the intrinsic muscles of the hand, particularly those controlling the ulnar side, resulting in an imbalance of muscle forces that produces a claw hand deformity. Patients with ulnar nerve injury typically present with sensory deficits in the medial aspect of the hand and weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles. This manifests as a claw hand deformity\u2014characterized by hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the interphalangeal joints of the fourth and fifth digits\u2014and may include difficulty with fine motor tasks. Evaluation includes a detailed clinical exam to assess motor and sensory deficits. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) help to localize the lesion and assess its severity. Differential diagnoses include radial nerve palsy (which would produce wrist drop) and median nerve injury (leading to loss of thumb opposition and thenar atrophy). Initial management is typically conservative, including immobilization, splinting, and physical therapy. In cases where nerve conduction is severely compromised or in the presence of persistent deficits, surgical intervention (e.g., nerve decompression or repair) may be necessary. For pregnant or lactating patients, conservative management is preferred unless surgical intervention becomes absolutely necessary, at which point anesthesia and surgical planning take into account maternal-fetal safety. Option A (Wrist drop) would indicate radial nerve injury, which is more commonly associated with midshaft humeral fractures. Option B (Claw hand) correctly describes the deficit resulting from ulnar nerve injury at the elbow. Option C (Cheraalgia paresthetica) involves the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve and is unrelated to elbow trauma. Option D is not provided. \u2022 The ulnar nerve is especially vulnerable at the elbow due to its superficial location. \u2022 A claw hand deformity is a classic sign of ulnar nerve injury. \u2022 Early nerve conduction studies can help determine the extent of nerve injury and guide management. Recent studies continue to support the use of conservative management as the first-line approach in ulnar nerve injuries when possible, with surgery reserved for refractory cases. Advances in imaging and electrophysiological techniques have improved early diagnosis and localization, which in turn enhances prognosis with timely intervention.",

    "question": "Male patient presented with symptoms suggestive of proximal muscle weakness.\nHe has 2 cousins with the same presentation. EMG showed prolonged MUAPs.\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "option_a": "Inherited myopathy",
    "option_b": "Spinal muscular atrophy",
    "option_c": "Myasthenia gravis",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited disorder characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells, leading to progressive muscle weakness. A positive family history in a patient with proximal muscle weakness strongly suggests a hereditary neuromuscular disorder. SMA is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, leading to decreased levels of the SMN protein. This protein deficiency results in the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, causing chronic denervation and subsequent reinnervation, which is reflected on EMG studies by prolonged and high-amplitude motor unit action potentials. Patients with SMA typically present with progressive proximal muscle weakness, particularly affecting the limb-girdle muscles. A family history is common since most forms of SMA are autosomal recessive. Lower motor neuron signs such as muscle atrophy and fasciculations may also be observed. Diagnosis involves a combination of family history, clinical examination, and electrophysiological studies. EMG in SMA shows prolonged, high-amplitude motor unit action potentials indicative of chronic denervation with reinnervation. Genetic testing for SMN1 mutations confirms the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include inherited myopathies (which typically produce short-duration, low-amplitude potentials on EMG) and myasthenia gravis (which presents with fluctuating weakness and abnormal neuromuscular transmission). Management is primarily supportive, including physical and occupational therapy, respiratory care, and nutritional support. Recent advances include disease-modifying therapies such as nusinersen, although these are more commonly used in pediatric SMA. In the context of pregnancy and lactation, treatment is supportive and genetic counseling is essential. Medication choices should be evaluated for fetal safety, with many treatments being deferred or adjusted during these periods. Option A (Inherited myopathy) is inconsistent with the EMG findings, which in myopathies typically exhibit short-duration, low-amplitude potentials. Option B (Spinal muscular atrophy) fits the familial history and the EMG findings of prolonged MUAPs, indicating a neurogenic cause. Option C (Myasthenia gravis) is characterized by fluctuating weakness and normal motor unit potentials on EMG with an abnormal decrement on repetitive nerve stimulation, which does not match the case. \u2022 Prolonged motor unit potentials on EMG suggest a neurogenic process with chronic reinnervation. \u2022 A positive family history is a key diagnostic clue in hereditary neuromuscular disorders like SMA. \u2022 Differentiating myopathic from neurogenic processes with EMG can guide accurate diagnosis. Ongoing research in SMA is focused on genetic therapies and biomarkers for disease progression. While disease-modifying agents have altered the landscape in pediatric SMA, management of adult-onset SMA remains primarily supportive. Newer therapeutic approaches continue to be evaluated in clinical trials.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common neurological complications in patients with HIV infection. The most frequent type is a distal, symmetrical, predominantly sensory polyneuropathy. The distal symmetrical sensory polyneuropathy observed in HIV patients is thought to be due to a combination of direct neurotoxic effects of the virus as well as neurotoxicity from certain antiretroviral medications. This pathology primarily affects the small sensory fibers in a stocking-glove distribution. Patients with HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy typically complain of burning, tingling, or numbness in the feet that may progress proximally. Motor involvement is generally minimal, which distinguishes it from mixed motor-sensory neuropathies. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings supported by nerve conduction studies that confirm a sensory-predominant pattern. Differential diagnoses include diabetic neuropathy, vitamin B12 deficiency neuropathy, and other toxic neuropathies. A careful medication review is also important to rule out antiretroviral toxicity. First-line management involves symptomatic treatment of neuropathic pain with medications such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or certain antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine or amitriptyline). Optimization of the antiretroviral regimen is also essential. In pregnant and lactating patients, the choice of neuropathic pain medications requires careful consideration of fetal and neonatal safety, often favoring non-pharmacological treatments initially or selecting medications with better safety profiles. Option A (Distal symmetrical motor and sensory neuropathy) implies significant motor involvement, which is not typical of HIV-associated neuropathy. Option B (Distal symmetrical sensory neuropathy) correctly reflects the predominantly sensory nature of the neuropathy seen in most HIV patients. Option C (Distal symmetrical motor neuropathy) is incorrect as it neglects the sensory predominance that is characteristic of this condition. \u2022 HIV-associated neuropathy is predominantly a sensory disorder with symptoms typically starting in the feet. \u2022 Always review the patient\u2019s medication list as antiretroviral drugs can contribute to neuropathic symptoms. \u2022 Management focuses on symptomatic relief and optimizing HIV therapy. Recent research continues to reinforce that distal symmetrical sensory polyneuropathy is the most common neurological complication in HIV. Guidelines emphasize early recognition and symptomatic management, as well as periodic reassessment of antiretroviral therapy to minimize neurotoxicity.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This question addresses the localization of neurological symptoms based on dermatomal and myotomal distributions in the upper limb. The inner (medial) arm and forearm sensory disturbances, together with weakness of muscles innervated by nerves with lower cervical contributions, point toward a lower trunk (C8-T1) involvement. Lesions of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (comprising nerve roots C8-T1) can produce sensory disturbances along the medial aspect of the upper limb and affect motor fibers destined for parts of the hand, including elements of the median nerve (which supplies thenar muscles). Pathologic processes (compression, traumatic injury, or inflammatory radiculopathy) affecting these roots lead to impaired conduction and the ensuing clinical deficits. Patients with lower trunk involvement typically report paresthesias along the inner aspect of the arm and forearm. Weakness of thenar muscles suggests compromise of the median nerve fibers arising partly from the C8-T1 roots. Pain on raising the arm can occur due to traction or compression exacerbating the underlying radicular pathology. The diagnostic work\u2010up includes a detailed history and neurological examination, followed by adjunct studies such as nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) to pinpoint the lesion\u2019s location. Differential diagnoses include cervical radiculopathy (which might involve other dermatomes if higher roots are affected), ulnar neuropathy (confined to the ulnar distribution) and brachial plexus neuritis. MRI of the cervical spine and brachial plexus can help differentiate structural from inflammatory causes. First-line management includes conservative treatment such as physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and sometimes corticosteroids if inflammation is suspected. In cases where there is evidence of structural compression, surgical decompression may be warranted. During pregnancy or lactation, clinicians should prefer conservative management; NSAIDs and steroids (after risk\u2010benefit analysis) may be used, with careful monitoring and avoidance of teratogenic agents. Option A (C8-T1) is correct because the described sensory and motor deficits localize to the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. Option B (C7, C8) would more commonly present with additional mid-limb involvement and is not as consistent with an isolated inner arm/forearm distribution. Options C and D were not provided, so analysis is limited to the available choices. 1. Lower trunk brachial plexopathies (C8-T1) produce symptoms in the medial arm/forearm and may affect intrinsic hand muscles. 2. Always correlate sensory findings with motor deficits to accurately localize the lesion. 3. Imaging (MRI) and electrodiagnostic studies are key to confirming the level of nerve involvement. Recent studies emphasize the value of high-resolution MRI and nerve conduction studies in distinguishing radiculopathy from brachial plexus lesions. Guidelines continue to support a conservative initial management approach unless definitive structural abnormalities that require surgical intervention are identified.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Tangier disease is a rare inherited disorder of lipid metabolism. The condition is hallmarked by extremely low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which plays a critical role in reverse cholesterol transport. Mutations in the ABCA1 gene disrupt the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells, leading to impaired formation of HDL. This results in markedly decreased HDL levels and the accumulation of cholesterol esters in various tissues, including lymphoid tissues, tonsils, and peripheral nerves. Patients may present with peripheral neuropathy (manifesting as paresthesias and burning sensations, especially in the hands), enlarged, orange-hued tonsils, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Additionally, due to abnormal lipid profiles, these patients are at increased risk for premature atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Laboratory evaluation revealing extremely low HDL cholesterol levels is a key diagnostic clue. Other lipid parameters may be variably affected. Differential diagnoses include other dyslipidemias; however, the constellation of clinical findings (particularly the orange tonsils and peripheral neuropathy) is highly suggestive of Tangier disease. Genetic testing for ABCA1 mutations can provide definitive confirmation. There is no definitive cure for Tangier disease; management is primarily supportive. A lipid-friendly diet and lifestyle modifications are recommended to mitigate cardiovascular risk. In pregnancy and lactation, nutritional counseling is essential and medications affecting lipid metabolism should be used with caution, always weighing maternal benefit against fetal risk. Option A (Low HDL) is correct as Tangier disease is characterized by markedly reduced levels of HDL cholesterol. Option B (High HDL) is incorrect because the condition results in diminished HDL. Options C (High Cholesterol) and D (Low triglyceride) do not reflect the typical lipid abnormalities seen in Tangier disease. 1. The presence of orange or yellowish tonsils is a classic clinical hallmark of Tangier disease. 2. Despite low HDL levels, Tangier disease patients may paradoxically develop premature coronary artery disease. 3. Peripheral neuropathy in Tangier disease is attributed to lipid deposition in nerve tissues. Recent genetic studies have improved understanding of ABCA1 mutations and their effects on lipid profiles. While no targeted therapies exist, ongoing research in gene therapy and lipid metabolism may offer new interventions in the future. Current guidelines emphasize lifestyle modifications to manage cardiovascular risks.",

    "explanation": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by fluctuating weakness due to antibodies interfering with neuromuscular transmission. Ocular myasthenia gravis, a subset of MG, primarily affects the extraocular muscles, producing symptoms like ptosis and diplopia. In MG, autoantibodies (most commonly against the acetylcholine receptor [AChR]) impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by blocking, degrading, or altering receptor function. In ocular myasthenia, the immune attack is somewhat restricted to the muscles controlling eye movement, which may account for lower antibody detection rates in serum. Patients with ocular myasthenia present with fluctuating symptoms including ptosis (drooping eyelids) and diplopia (double vision) that worsen with muscle use and improve with rest. Because serologic AChR antibodies can be negative in ocular MG, electrophysiological studies are often key in confirming the diagnosis. The diagnostic workup includes serologic testing for AChR and anti-MuSK antibodies, but due to lower sensitivity in ocular forms, single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) is considered the most sensitive test. Differential diagnoses include cranial nerve disorders and other causes of fluctuating diplopia, which can be distinguished by comprehensive neurological evaluation and electrophysiological studies. First-line treatment for ocular MG includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine. If symptoms persist, corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants (e.g., azathioprine) may be added. Thymectomy may also be considered in select cases. In pregnancy or lactation, pyridostigmine is generally considered safe, though immunosuppressants require careful risk/benefit analysis and close monitoring. Option A (Single fiber EMG) is correct since it has the highest sensitivity for detecting abnormal neuromuscular transmission in ocular MG. Although testing for AChR antibodies (Option B) is useful, its sensitivity in isolated ocular MG is lower, and Option C (Anti striated muscle antibody) is more pertinent to thymoma-associated or generalized MG rather than ocular MG. 1. Ocular MG may be seronegative, so a normal AChR antibody test does not rule out the diagnosis. 2. Single fiber EMG is the most sensitive diagnostic tool but requires specialized equipment and expertise. 3. Symptoms typically worsen with prolonged use of the affected muscles. Current clinical guidelines continue to endorse SFEMG as the gold-standard diagnostic test in cases where serologic tests are negative, particularly in ocular MG. Recent advances are aimed at refining antibody assays and exploring novel immunomodulatory therapies.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This scenario involves a post-treatment breast cancer patient with a history of radiation therapy who now presents with neurological deficits in the distribution of the brachial plexus. The constellation of clinical symptoms and EMG findings is consistent with radiation-induced brachial plexopathy. Radiation-induced plexopathy results from chronic damage to the brachial plexus fibers secondary to radiotherapy. Radiation causes microvascular damage, demyelination, and eventually axonal loss. A key electrodiagnostic finding in this condition is myokymic discharges\u2014spontaneous, rhythmic bursts of activity in affected muscles, which are highly suggestive of radiation-induced injury. Patients typically present years after radiation exposure with slowly progressive upper limb weakness and paresthesias. In this case, the distribution of sensory deficits (involving the medial forearm and the last 2 and a half digits) aligns well with lower trunk involvement, a pattern that fits radiation-induced plexopathy. Neoplastic plexopathy, by contrast, often presents with severe pain and rapid progression and typically lacks myokymic discharges. Diagnosis is made via a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and electrodiagnostic studies (EMG revealing myokymia is highly characteristic). Imaging with MRI can help rule out tumor recurrence. Differential diagnoses include neoplastic plexopathy, post-surgical neuropathy, and inflammatory plexopathies; each can be differentiated by timeline, pain severity, and specific EMG findings. Management is predominantly conservative. First-line approaches include physical therapy, pain management (with neuropathic pain agents such as gabapentin or pregabalin), and careful observation. Second-line treatments might involve interventions for spasticity or isolated nerve blocks. In pregnancy or lactation, medication choices require increased caution; non-pharmacological management and referral to specialists should be prioritized to avoid fetal exposure to potentially harmful drugs. Option A (Radiation induced plexopathy) is correct because the clinical history (breast cancer treatment and radiation), the distribution of neurologic deficits, and the presence of myokymic discharges on EMG strongly support this diagnosis. Option B (Neoplastic plexopathy) is less likely because it typically involves intense, often lancinating pain, rapid progression, and does not characteristically exhibit myokymic discharges. 1. Myokymic discharges on EMG are a nearly pathognomonic finding for radiation-induced plexopathy. 2. A history of radiotherapy in a breast cancer patient with delayed onset upper extremity deficits strongly suggests a radiation-induced process. 3. Differentiating between radiation-induced and neoplastic plexopathy is essential because treatment approaches differ significantly. Recent research reaffirms the diagnostic utility of EMG in distinguishing radiation-induced plexopathy from neoplastic causes. Current guidelines emphasize conservative management with an interdisciplinary approach, combining physical medicine, pain management, and careful imaging surveillance to exclude tumor recurrence.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting both upper and lower motor neurons. It typically presents with a combination of spasticity (UMN signs) and muscle wasting with weakness (LMN signs), with a clinical course that is relentlessly progressive. The underlying mechanism in ALS is degeneration of motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Proposed mechanisms include glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, abnormal protein aggregation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although the exact cause is not fully known, both genetic and environmental factors may contribute. Patients often present with an insidious onset of weakness that initially may appear localized \u2013 for example, starting in one hand \u2013 and then progressively spreads to other regions. The presence of muscle atrophy with normal sensory examination is typical. Even if UMN signs (such as brisk reflexes) are common, in regions with severe LMN loss, reflexes may be diminished or absent (as seen with the absent triceps reflex in this patient). The evaluation includes electromyography (EMG) to look for evidence of denervation and reinnervation and nerve conduction studies to exclude alternative diagnoses. Differential diagnoses include multifocal motor neuropathy (which typically shows conduction block on NCS) and other focal motor neuron disorders. Brain and spinal cord MRI may be used to rule out structural lesions. The current management of ALS is multidisciplinary. First\u2010line disease\u2010modifying treatments include riluzole, which modestly prolongs survival, and edaravone has been approved to slow functional decline. Symptomatic therapies include physical and occupational therapy, nutritional support including gastrostomy if needed, and respiratory care. In pregnancy and lactation, the use of riluzole and edaravone must be carefully weighed due to limited safety data, with specialists often opting for supportive care if necessary. Option A (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is correct. Option B (Multifocal motor neuron disease with conduction block) refers to a disorder more consistent with multifocal motor neuropathy, which often shows conduction block on NCS and typically remains limited to the upper limbs. Option C (Hirayama disease) is usually a monomelic amyotrophy seen in young males with a static or slowly progressive course limited to one limb. 1. ALS is the most common motor neuron disease in adults, often presenting with both upper and lower motor neuron signs, even if not all regions display both. 2. Normal sensory examination in a patient with progressive weakness and atrophy is highly suggestive of ALS. 3. EMG is an essential diagnostic tool that demonstrates both denervation and reinnervation patterns. Recent clinical guidelines emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to ALS care, with ongoing research into novel therapies including gene-targeted approaches and stem cell therapies. The modest benefit from riluzole and edaravone underscores the need for continued research in neuroprotection.",

    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an inflammatory myopathy typically seen in individuals over the age of 50. It represents the most common acquired muscle disease in the elderly. IBM is characterized by both inflammatory and degenerative changes within the muscle. Pathologically, muscle biopsies reveal endomysial inflammation, rimmed vacuoles, and inclusions that contain proteins such as beta-amyloid. The exact pathogenesis remains unclear, with theories suggesting autoimmune mechanisms intertwined with degenerative processes. Clinically, IBM presents with a slow and insidious onset of muscle weakness that may have a variable distribution \u2013 often affecting both proximal and distal muscles. Classic findings include weakness of the finger flexors and knee extensors, and patients may also experience dysphagia. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical features, mildly to moderately elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, electromyography findings, and ultimately confirmed by muscle biopsy demonstrating the characteristic histopathologic features. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis and dermatomyositis but these conditions tend to occur in a younger demographic and have differing inflammatory patterns. There is currently no consistently effective treatment for IBM and it tends to be refractory to immunosuppressive therapies. The management is mainly supportive with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and adaptive devices. Experimental therapies continue to be explored. In the rare instance of younger patients or those in reproductive age, caution with immunosuppressive agents in pregnancy and lactation is advised, but IBM mostly affects older individuals. Option A (Inclusion body myositis) is correct because epidemiologically and clinically, IBM is the most common myopathy in individuals above 50 years of age. The absence of other viable options further corroborates this answer. 1. IBM classically affects older males with a slowly progressive course and often asymmetric weakness affecting the finger flexors. 2. Muscle biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis with its distinctive rimmed vacuoles and inclusions. 3. Unlike other inflammatory myopathies, IBM typically does not respond to high-dose corticosteroids. Recent studies highlight the dual inflammatory and degenerative nature of IBM. Current research is exploring targeted immunomodulatory therapies and anti-amyloid strategies, but the standard approach remains supportive care due to its resistance to conventional immunosuppressive treatments.",

    "explanation": "Distal acquired demyelinating symmetric (DADS) neuropathy is a subtype of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy that is frequently associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy and anti\u2013myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies. In patients with anti-MAG antibodies, the antibodies target myelin-associated glycoprotein, leading to a demyelinating process primarily affecting the distal segments of peripheral nerves. This autoimmune-mediated damage results in slowed nerve conduction and can eventually lead to secondary axonal loss. Clinically, DADS presents with a symmetric, predominantly distal neuropathy characterized by sensory disturbances (such as numbness and tingling) and sometimes mild motor weakness. The presence of an IgM monoclonal gammopathy in these patients should raise suspicion for anti-MAG neuropathy. Diagnosis is established through nerve conduction studies that demonstrate features of demyelination, in conjunction with serum studies that detect IgM monoclonal gammopathy and the presence of anti-MAG antibodies. Differential diagnoses include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and other paraproteinemic neuropathies, which can be differentiated by electrophysiological findings and antibody testing. Treatment options have included immunomodulatory therapies. First-line management may involve intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and, in selected cases, rituximab has been utilized. Treatment is often aimed at reducing antibody levels and modulating the immune response. In pregnancy and lactation, IVIG remains a more acceptable option compared to rituximab, which is generally avoided due to its potential effects on the fetus or nursing infant. Option A (DADS) is correct since anti-MAG antibodies are most characteristically associated with distal acquired demyelinating symmetric neuropathy. The other options would not show this strong correlation. 1. Always consider anti-MAG neuropathy in older patients with a slowly progressive, symmetric distal neuropathy and an IgM gammopathy. 2. Nerve conduction studies along with antibody testing are critical for diagnosis. 3. Treatment remains largely immunomodulatory, although responses can be variable. Recent research supports the use of rituximab in selected patients with anti-MAG neuropathy; however, studies have shown variable benefit. Ongoing trials are further defining the role of B-cell depletion therapies and IVIG in these patients, with an emphasis on individualized treatment plans.",

    "question": "What is the nerve supply for shoulder adduction and internal rotation?",

    "option_c": "Subscapular",
    "option_d": "?",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Shoulder adduction and internal rotation are movements mediated by several muscles. The key muscles involved in these motions include the subscapularis, teres major, pectoralis major, and latissimus dorsi. When focusing on nerve supply from the options provided, the muscles innervated by the subscapular nerve are significant contributors to these functions. The subscapular nerve (dividing into upper and lower branches) innervates the subscapularis muscle, a major internal rotator, and typically also supplies the teres major, which aids both in adduction and internal rotation of the shoulder. Injury or dysfunction of these nerves can result in weakness of these specific movements. A deficit in the subscapular nerve function would primarily impair internal rotation (due to subscapularis weakness) and can also affect adduction when considering the role of teres major. In contrast, the axillary nerve predominantly supplies the deltoid (primarily responsible for abduction) and the suprascapular nerve supplies muscles responsible for abduction initiation and external rotation. The clinical evaluation involves testing the range of motion and strength in shoulder movements. Differential diagnoses may include nerve injuries involving the axillary or thoracodorsal nerves. Detailed neurological examination along with electromyographic studies can help differentiate between these nerve pathologies. Management of nerve injuries or dysfunction generally involves physical and occupational therapy to maintain range of motion and strength. In cases requiring further intervention, surgical nerve repair or nerve transfers may be considered. In pregnant or lactating patients, conservative management is preferred, with therapies tailored to avoid pharmacologic agents that could adversely affect the fetus or infant. Option A (Axillary nerve) is incorrect because it mainly supplies the deltoid and teres minor, which are involved in abduction and external rotation. Option B (Suprascapular nerve) is incorrect as it supplies the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which again do not mediate adduction and internal rotation. Option C (Subscapular nerve) is correct because it provides innervation to the subscapularis and teres major\u2014muscles that are critical for internal rotation and contribute to adduction. Option D is not provided. 1. The subscapular nerve, as a branch of the posterior cord, plays a key role in internal rotation via the subscapularis muscle. 2. Teres major, also innervated by a branch of the subscapular nerve, assists in both adduction and internal rotation of the shoulder. 3. Recognizing the specific functions of brachial plexus branches is key in localizing shoulder dysfunction. Recent anatomical and clinical studies continue to underscore the importance of detailed nerve mapping in shoulder injuries. Advances in imaging and electrodiagnostic techniques further aid in the differentiation of nerve injuries, and current rehabilitation protocols emphasize early conservative management with physical therapy to maximize functional recovery.",

    "explanation": "This question focuses on differentiating types of muscular dystrophy based on the pattern of muscle weakness. Muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases that lead to progressive muscle weakness. Limb\u2010girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) typically present with proximal (shoulder and pelvic girdle) weakness. Here, the patient shows proximal limb weakness, scapular winging, and sparing of the facial muscles \u2013 a key feature that helps differentiate among types. Calpain-3-related muscular dystrophy (LGMD2A) is caused by mutations in the CAPN3 gene, which encodes calpain-3, a muscle-specific protease. Loss of calpain-3 function leads to abnormal proteolysis and subsequent myofiber degeneration with replacement by fat and connective tissue. This process causes progressive weakness predominantly in the limb girdles, without involvement of facial muscles. Patients with LGMD2A usually present in adolescence with symmetrical proximal weakness. Characteristic clinical findings include difficulty in shoulder abduction (due to scapular winging) and hip extension weakness. The absence of facial muscle involvement is an important clinical clue distinguishing it from conditions such as facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. The workup includes serum creatine kinase (which is usually elevated), electromyography, and ultimately genetic testing for mutations in the CAPN3 gene. Muscle biopsy can also show dystrophic changes.

    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "The brachial plexus is organized into roots, trunks, divisions, cords, and branches. Sensory innervation of the medial forearm is provided by the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, which is derived from fibers of the medial cord (C8-T1). The lower trunk of the brachial plexus (formed by C8-T1) is the main contributor to the medial cord. Thus, a lesion affecting the lower trunk will produce sensory deficits in the medial forearm. In patients with a history of breast cancer, weight loss and focal neurological findings raise concern for metastatic spread, potentially involving the brachial plexus. Metastatic infiltration or radiation-induced neuropathy can compromise the lower trunk\u2019s integrity, leading to interruption of nerve impulses along the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve. A breast cancer patient with weight loss and localized sensory loss along the medial forearm indicates a likely involvement of the lower trunk. This is an important clinical clue, as new onset neurological deficits in patients with a history of malignancy should trigger evaluation for metastatic brachial plexopathy. Key differentials include brachial plexopathy due to metastasis, radiation-induced plexopathy, and even radiculopathies. Diagnostic evaluation should include imaging (MRI of the brachial plexus) to assess structural changes and electrophysiological studies (nerve conduction studies, electromyography) to delineate the extent of nerve involvement. Management involves addressing the underlying cause. In the case of metastatic involvement, a multidisciplinary approach is critical. This may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or palliative care measures, depending on the extent of the disease. In pregnant or lactating patients, modifications of oncology protocols are necessary to minimize fetal/neonatal exposure while still providing effective treatment. Consultation with specialists in maternal-fetal medicine, oncology, and neurology is important for individualized patient care. Option A (Lower trunk) is the best answer because it corresponds with the anatomic origin of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve and explains the sensory loss in the medial forearm. Option B (Upper trunk) would more likely affect the lateral arm and forearm, and the missing options (C and D) were likely distractors. \u2022 In patients with a history of breast cancer, new focal neurological deficits should prompt evaluation for metastatic involvement of the brachial plexus. \n\u2022 Sensory loss in the medial forearm specifically localizes the lesion to structures derived from the lower trunk (C8-T1). \n\u2022 A thorough diagnostic workup is critical to differentiate metastatic plexopathy from other etiologies such as radiation-induced injury. Recent clinical guidelines support early MRI and electrophysiological testing in suspected brachial plexopathies. Studies show that timely diagnosis and a multidisciplinary treatment approach improve both symptom management and quality of life. In the context of breast cancer, tailored oncologic therapies are crucial, with specific considerations and adjustments for pregnant or lactating patients to safeguard fetal and neonatal health while managing maternal disease.",
