    "explanation": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of Lewy body inclusions made up of alpha-synuclein. It typically presents with a combination of cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations, fluctuating attention, and parkinsonian motor symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia). DLB involves widespread deposition of alpha-synuclein in cortical and subcortical regions which disrupts neuronal function. This pathology leads to the characteristic symptoms seen in DLB. Compared to Parkinson\u2019s disease, the cortical involvement is more pronounced, accounting for the early cognitive decline and hallucinations. Patients often present with parkinsonism alongside early visual hallucinations and fluctuating cognition. The typical poor or minimal response to levodopa helps differentiate DLB from idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, where a robust motor improvement is often noted. The diagnosis is primarily clinical. Diagnostic criteria (such as the revised consensus criteria) include fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations, and spontaneous parkinsonian features. Differentials include Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia (which usually has a substantial levodopa response and a later cognitive decline) and other atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Functional imaging (such as dopamine transporter SPECT) can support the diagnosis by showing reduced striatal uptake. Management of DLB is challenging. First-line treatment for cognitive symptoms includes cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., rivastigmine), which have been shown to have some benefit in DLB. For parkinsonian symptoms, levodopa can be trialed but often with limited efficacy. Caution with antipsychotics is crucial due to severe neuroleptic sensitivity. In pregnancy or lactation, any use of these agents requires careful evaluation since many cholinesterase inhibitors are contraindicated; supportive management becomes key. Option A (DLB) is correct because the combination of parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia), visual hallucinations, and poor response to levodopa is highly suggestive of DLB. Other parkinsonian syndromes generally show a better motor response to levodopa or lack the prominent hallucinations seen in DLB. 1. Early visual hallucinations are a core feature of DLB. 2. A poor response to levodopa in the setting of parkinsonism should raise suspicion for DLB. 3. Extreme sensitivity to antipsychotics is a well-known issue in DLB patients. Recent guidelines stress the importance of early and accurate diagnosis of DLB to ensure appropriate management of both cognitive and motor symptoms. There is ongoing research into disease-modifying therapies targeting alpha-synuclein aggregation, though current management remains symptomatic.",

    "question": "Case scenario of a patient with 5 months history of unilateral rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor and postural instability. What is the next step?",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder that typically presents with asymmetric motor symptoms including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and later postural instability. The clinical diagnosis is primarily made based on characteristic signs rather than reliance on imaging. PD is caused by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to a dopamine deficit in the basal ganglia. This loss leads to altered motor control and the classical motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. The unilateral onset of rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and even early postural instability fits the typical early presentation of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Improvement in motor symptoms with levodopa therapy is often used as a diagnostic criterion. The diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease is clinical, often based on the United Kingdom Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society Brain Bank criteria or the MDS clinical diagnostic criteria. Differential diagnoses include essential tremor (which typically lacks rigidity and bradykinesia), vascular parkinsonism, and atypical parkinsonian syndromes like progressive supranuclear palsy, which might show early instability but with additional ocular findings. Levodopa remains the gold standard for symptomatic management of motor symptoms in Parkinson\u2019s disease. In younger patients or in early stages, alternatives like MAO-B inhibitors or dopamine agonists may be considered. During pregnancy, levodopa is generally considered relatively safe after careful risk-benefit discussion, and it is used in lactation with caution. Expert guidelines recommend a personalized treatment plan based on symptom severity and patient factors. Option A (Levodopa) is correct because in a patient with a classic clinical presentation of Parkinson\u2019s disease, a trial with levodopa is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Option B (DOPA-PET scan) is not routinely recommended for a classic presentation and is reserved for cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain. 1. Unilateral onset of motor symptoms is highly characteristic for idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. 2. A favorable response to levodopa helps confirm the diagnosis. 3. Over time, symptoms typically progress to bilateral involvement. Current guidelines from the Movement Disorder Society reinforce levodopa as first-line treatment for PD. Recent studies continue to investigate neuroprotective therapies although none have yet replaced levodopa as the cornerstone of symptomatic management.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Orthostatic tremor is a rare movement disorder characterized by a rapid, high-frequency tremor (typically 13-18 Hz) in the legs that is present when standing and abates with sitting or walking. It is classically associated with a sensation of unsteadiness on standing. While the exact mechanism remains uncertain, it is believed that abnormal, synchronous oscillatory activity in central motor networks leads to the high-frequency tremor. Electrophysiological studies, including surface EMG, support this distinctive frequency and pattern of muscle activation. Patients report a feeling of instability or unsteadiness when standing, which is relieved by ambulation. The high-frequency tremor is often not visible to the naked eye but can be confirmed with electromyography. The diagnosis is made based on clinical history and confirmed by EMG demonstrating a high-frequency oscillatory pattern when the patient is standing. Differential diagnoses include essential tremor, which usually occurs with action and is not confined to standing, and other forms of tremor-related disorders. First-line treatments for orthostatic tremor include medications such as clonazepam and gabapentin. If patients are pregnant or lactating, the safety profile of these medications must be closely considered; for instance, gabapentin is typically Category C and clonazepam may carry greater risks. Non-pharmacological strategies and referral to a movement disorder specialist may be required. Option A (Orthostatic tremor) is correct because the clinical description of a tremor that improves with walking is the hallmark of orthostatic tremor. No alternative options were provided, so the marked answer accurately reflects the diagnosis. 1. Orthostatic tremor characteristically disappears with ambulation. 2. EMG is key to confirming the diagnosis due to the high-frequency nature of the tremor. 3. This disorder is rare and can be misdiagnosed as other forms of tremor if the context is not carefully considered. Recent literature emphasizes the role of electrophysiological testing in confirming the diagnosis of orthostatic tremor. Although there are no large-scale randomized trials due to its rarity, smaller studies support the use of clonazepam and gabapentin as first-line agents. Current practice guidelines recommend a cautious, individualized approach, particularly with regard to the use of these medications in special populations such as pregnant or lactating patients.",

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question focuses on differentiating hereditary cerebellar ataxias. In particular, it contrasts Friedreich's ataxia with ataxia oculomotor apraxia (AOA). Although both are autosomal recessive, AOA is characterized by oculomotor apraxia\u2014difficulty initiating saccades\u2014and compensatory head movements, without systemic involvement such as cardiomyopathy or skeletal deformities that are common in Friedreich's ataxia. Ataxia oculomotor apraxia involves neurodegeneration in the cerebellum and its connections. The impaired integration between the cerebellum and ocular motor control centers results in oculomotor apraxia. Peripheral neuropathy often accounts for decreased deep tendon reflexes. In contrast, Friedreich's ataxia is due to a mutation in the frataxin gene leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and skeletal abnormalities. Patients with AOA typically present with gait ataxia and difficulties with coordinated eye movements. The compensatory head-shaking observed helps the patient overcome the inability to initiate proper saccadic eye movements. The absence of systemic features (e.g., cardiomyopathy, diabetes) helps distinguish it from Friedreich's ataxia. Diagnosis begins with a detailed family history and neurological examination. Genetic testing plays a pivotal role in differentiating between various ataxias. Key differentials include Friedreich's ataxia (systemic features present), spinocerebellar ataxias (usually autosomal dominant), and ataxia telangiectasia (characterized by telangiectasias and immunodeficiency). Currently, there is no curative treatment for AOA; management is supportive. The recommended approach includes physical, occupational, and speech therapies to enhance quality of life. Genetic counseling is essential for affected families. In pregnancy, preconception counseling is advised, as prenatal testing may be available, and no specific contraindications exist for supportive therapies during lactation. Option a (Friedreich's ataxia) is incorrect because, despite its autosomal recessive inheritance and decreased reflexes, its typical association with cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and skeletal deformities distinguishes it from the presented case. Option b (Ataxia oculomotor apraxia) is correct as it perfectly matches the described inheritance, clinical presentation (including compensatory head shaking due to oculomotor apraxia), and absence of systemic features. Option c (Spinocerebellar ataxia III) is excluded due to its autosomal dominant pattern and different ophthalmologic manifestations. Option d (Ataxia telangiectasia) is incorrect because it usually presents with telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, and elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels. \u2022 Compensatory head shaking in the context of ataxia strongly suggests oculomotor apraxia.  \u2022 The absence of systemic signs helps differentiate AOA from Friedreich's ataxia.  \u2022 Genetic testing is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in genetic testing have allowed for better delineation of AOA subtypes. Research continues into neuroprotective strategies, though current management remains supportive. There is ongoing interest in targeted molecular therapies, but none have yet altered the standard of care.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question examines palatal myoclonus, distinguishing between its symptomatic and essential forms. Essential palatal myoclonus is an idiopathic condition that is characterized by rhythmic, fast contractions of the palatal muscles that persist during sleep, while symptomatic palatal myoclonus is usually due to identifiable brain lesions and often ceases during sleep. Essential palatal myoclonus results from abnormal oscillatory activity within central pattern generators controlling the palatal muscles. In contrast, the symptomatic type is typically associated with lesions in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (dentato-rubral-olivary pathway), leading to disinhibited rhythmic contractions. The persistence of movements during sleep in the essential form is considered a key distinguishing feature. Clinically, essential palatal myoclonus presents with fast, rhythmic palatal movements that continue during sleep. The usual audible clicking seen in some cases isn\u2019t mandatory for the diagnosis. In symptomatic cases, the palatal movements are slower, may have an audible component, and typically abate during sleep due to the influence of sleep-related neural inhibition. Diagnosis is largely clinical and supported by neuroimaging. Brain MRI is essential to exclude structural lesions in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle, which would favor a symptomatic etiology. Differential diagnoses include other forms of myoclonus and other movement disorders affecting the oropharyngeal region. Management of essential palatal myoclonus is largely symptomatic. Botulinum toxin injections into the involved muscles can be very effective. Other options include medications such as clonazepam or valproic acid, though their use in pregnancy or lactation must be carefully considered. In pregnant patients, the risks of systemic medications must be balanced against benefits, and non-pharmacologic management may be prioritized. Option a (Symptomatic palatal myoclonus) is incorrect because the symptomatic form is typically slower-paced, often accompanied by clicking sounds, and usually subsides during sleep. Option b (Essential palatal myoclonus) is correct because the fast, rhythmic nature of the palatal contractions that persist during sleep is characteristic of the essential type. \u2022 Persistence of palatal myoclonus during sleep strongly favors an essential process.  \u2022 MRI is key to exclude structural lesions associated with symptomatic myoclonus.  \u2022 The absence of clicking does not rule out essential palatal myoclonus. Recent clinical studies affirm that essential palatal myoclonus is a distinct clinical entity. There is ongoing research into the efficacy of botulinum toxin injections, with several recent trials supporting its use as first-line therapy when symptomatic treatment is necessary.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders and is primarily characterized by action or postural tremors. This condition is noted for its symmetric involvement and a frequency often in the 4\u201312 Hz range, with a classic feature being the improvement of tremor amplitude with alcohol ingestion. The underlying mechanisms of essential tremor are thought to involve abnormal oscillatory activity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways. Genetic predisposition is common, and ET often follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with variable penetrance. Neuroimaging sometimes reveals subtle changes in cerebellar function, although definitive structural abnormalities are not typically present. Clinically, patients present with a bilateral, symmetrical postural or action tremor affecting the upper limbs. Improvement with alcohol is a distinctive hallmark. The tremor is usually absent at rest, helping distinguish it from parkinsonian tremor. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. Differential diagnoses include enhanced physiologic tremor, which can be triggered by anxiety or stimulants and typically does not improve with alcohol, and drug-induced tremor. A careful history and neurological exam are crucial, and in ambiguous cases, electrophysiological studies may help characterize the tremor frequency and pattern. First-line treatments for essential tremor include non-selective beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) and the anticonvulsant primidone. In patients who cannot tolerate these medications, alternatives such as topiramate or benzodiazepines may be considered. In cases refractory to pharmacotherapy, surgical interventions like deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be indicated. During pregnancy, both propranolol and primidone carry potential risks\u2014careful risk-benefit discussion and consultation with obstetrics are required. Adjustments to dosages and close monitoring during lactation are also necessary. Option a (Essential tremor) is correct since the patient\u2019s symmetric action tremor with a frequency of around 12 Hz and improvement with alcohol fits the classic description of ET. Option b (Enhanced physiologic tremor) is incorrect as it is usually transient, less rhythmic, and does not typically improve with alcohol consumption. \u2022 Alcohol responsiveness is a key clinical clue in diagnosing essential tremor.  \u2022 Essential tremor typically presents as a bilateral action tremor without accompanying neurological deficits.  \u2022 Family history often reveals an autosomal dominant pattern in ET. Recent guidelines and studies have reinforced the role of propranolol and primidone as first-line therapies. There is growing interest in non-invasive treatments such as focused ultrasound, and research into the underlying pathophysiology continues to explore cerebellar dysfunction and genetic underpinnings.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is part of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. It is characterized primarily by early postural instability and vertical gaze palsy, particularly difficulty with downward gaze. These features differentiate it from other parkinsonian disorders. PSP is a tauopathy, meaning that abnormal accumulation of the tau protein leads to neuronal degeneration predominantly in the brainstem (especially the midbrain), basal ganglia, and frontal lobes. The midbrain atrophy results in the classic 'hummingbird sign' seen on MRI. Clinically, patients with PSP present with frequent falls, particularly early in the disease course, and have difficulty with vertical eye movements. These symptoms, along with the axial rigidity and poor response to levodopa, help differentiate PSP from Parkinson\u2019s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. The workup includes a thorough clinical examination and neuroimaging. MRI findings, such as midbrain atrophy resulting in the hummingbird sign, are supportive of the diagnosis of PSP. Differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease (typically asymmetric and tremor-dominant), multiple system atrophy (with prominent autonomic dysfunction), and corticobasal degeneration (which presents with limb apraxia and asymmetric symptoms). There is currently no disease-modifying treatment for PSP. Management is largely supportive, focusing on physical therapy, occupational therapy, and fall prevention measures. Trials of levodopa are often attempted, though benefits are limited. In terms of pregnancy and lactation, while PSP is extremely rare in this group, supportive treatments and physiotherapy do not pose specific risks, and medications should be chosen with caution due to potential teratogenic effects. Option a (PSP) is correct because the clinical picture of early frequent falls and vertical gaze palsy along with MRI findings of midbrain atrophy (hummingbird sign) is classic for PSP. Other options, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple system atrophy, or corticobasal degeneration, lack the combination of early vertical gaze impairment and the associated imaging abnormalities. \u2022 Early falls combined with vertical gaze palsy should raise suspicion for PSP.  \u2022 The 'hummingbird sign' on MRI is highly suggestive of PSP.  \u2022 Levodopa responsiveness is often minimal, which helps differentiate PSP from Parkinson\u2019s disease. Ongoing research in PSP is focused on tau-targeted therapies to slow disease progression. Recent clinical trials have emphasized the importance of early diagnosis and supportive care, while new imaging modalities continue to refine our diagnostic accuracy.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "In Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), patients may develop psychotic symptoms such as visual hallucinations and concurrent cognitive decline. The therapeutic challenge is to alleviate psychosis without worsening motor symptoms. Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic with minimal D2 receptor blockade, meets this need. PD psychosis is thought to arise from a combination of dopaminergic medication side\u2010effects and the underlying neurodegenerative process. Clozapine\u2019s receptor profile\u2014with low D2 antagonism and high 5-HT2A antagonism\u2014modulates serotonergic and glutamatergic transmission, leading to improvements in psychosis while preserving motor function. Its efficacy is supported by randomized controlled trials despite the risk of agranulocytosis. Patients with PD may experience hallucinations (often visual) and memory impairment as part of their disease progression or secondary to dopaminergic therapy. The correct choice provides symptomatic control of psychosis without exacerbating motor impairment, and the modest cognitive benefit observed in some studies may help patients with concurrent memory deficits. In evaluating PD patients with hallucinations and cognitive issues, it is important to differentiate PD psychosis from dementia with Lewy bodies. Other considerations include ruling out medication-induced psychosis by reviewing dopaminergic therapy regimens. Differential diagnosis may feature agents such as quetiapine and rivastigmine, but head\u2010to\u2010head evidence favors clozapine for pure psychotic control. The first-line pharmacological treatment for PD psychosis is clozapine when non-pharmacological adjustments fail. Initiation requires baseline and periodic complete blood counts due to the risk of agranulocytosis. In pregnant or lactating patients, the risk-benefit balance is crucial; clozapine is generally avoided if possible due to potential fetal risks, and alternative strategies like levodopa dose adjustments might be preferred. When clozapine is the best option, it should be used at the lowest effective dose with close monitoring. Option a (Clozapine) is correct as it has proven efficacy in reducing hallucinations in PD without worsening motor functions. Option b (Quetiapine) is often used off-label but lacks robust evidence and may cause sedation or orthostatic hypotension. Option c (Rivastigmine) is primarily used for cognitive symptoms in PD dementia and offers insufficient control of established psychosis when used alone. 1. Clozapine is the gold standard for treating PD psychosis despite the need for regular blood monitoring. 2. The choice of antipsychotic in PD must consider the balance between psychosis control and motor function preservation. Recent guidelines from the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society continue to support clozapine as a first-line therapy for PD psychosis. Ongoing research is aimed at developing agents that reduce psychotic symptoms without significant hematological risks.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Peak-dose dyskinesia is a common complication in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients receiving levodopa therapy, characterized by involuntary choreic movements at times of maximal drug effect. A key therapeutic goal is reducing these dyskinesias while maintaining motor control. The pathogenesis of peak-dose dyskinesia involves excessive and pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation leading to secondary changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Amantadine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, helps ameliorate these dyskinesias by dampening glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Clinically, patients exhibit involuntary, often choreiform movements during the peak effect of levodopa. This indicates an imbalance between dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems, aligning with the mechanism of action of amantadine. Differentiating peak-dose dyskinesia from other movement complications (such as off-period dystonia or biphasic dyskinesia) requires careful timing correlation with medication dosing. Other differential considerations include adjusting levodopa dosing regimens and evaluating for medication-induced side effects. First-line treatment for peak-dose dyskinesia is the addition of amantadine due to its NMDA receptor antagonism. If patients have refractory symptoms, adjustments in levodopa dosing or fractionation may be considered. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of amantadine is determined by a careful risk-benefit analysis as data in these populations is limited; non-pharmacological strategies or dose adjustments might be prioritized. Option a (Amantadine) is correct because multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing peak-dose dyskinesia. Other options, such as dopamine agonists or MAO-B inhibitors, do not directly target the glutamatergic pathway and are less effective in controlling dyskinesias. 1. Amantadine is uniquely effective for peak-dose dyskinesia due to its NMDA receptor antagonism. 2. Dyskinesia management often requires a tailored approach, balancing motor control with side effects. Recent studies and current guidelines (including those from the MDS) continue to endorse amantadine as the first-line agent for levodopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesia, with research ongoing to optimize dosing strategies and reduce side effects.",

    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Myoclonus-dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by the coexistence of myoclonic jerks and dystonic posturing, often presenting in young individuals. Two classical features aid in its diagnosis: diurnal variation and alcohol responsiveness. The disorder is frequently associated with mutations in the SGCE gene (DYT11). Diurnal variation may be due to fluctuations in neuronal excitability over the day, whereas alcohol responsiveness is thought to result from alcohol\u2019s enhancement of GABAergic inhibition, thereby transiently reducing symptoms. Patients typically report worsening of symptoms later in the day (diurnal variation) and a noticeable, albeit temporary, improvement in symptoms after alcohol consumption. These characteristic features help distinguish myoclonus-dystonia from other movement disorders. Differentials include essential myoclonus, other forms of dystonia, and functional movement disorders. A thorough history focusing on symptom fluctuation and response to alcohol is key. Genetic testing for SGCE mutations may be warranted. Management is symptomatic. First-line treatment options include benzodiazepines and other GABAergic agents. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be considered in refractory cases. In the context of pregnancy and lactation, the use of sedative medications must be carefully discussed with patients; many GABAergic drugs are regimens where risk-benefit analysis is essential, and non-pharmacologic strategies or postponing elective DBS may be considered. Option a (Diurnal variation) is a hallmark of the condition, and Option b (Alcohol responsiveness) is equally characteristic. The original marked answer only included diurnal variation; however, both features are central to the syndrome's diagnosis. 1. Myoclonus-dystonia often improves with alcohol intake, but this should not be recommended as a treatment due to potential long-term consequences. 2. Diurnal fluctuation of symptoms is a key diagnostic clue in young patients with mixed movement disorders. Recent research emphasizes the genetic basis of myoclonus-dystonia and supports the clinical significance of both diurnal variation and alcohol responsiveness.

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that typically presents with asymmetric motor abnormalities, including apraxia, rigidity, and atypical movement phenomena such as the \u2018alien limb\u2019 phenomenon. Radiologically, asymmetrical cortical atrophy is a key supportive finding. CBD is classified among tauopathies and is characterized by abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, leading to neuronal loss and gliosis. This pathology predominantly affects the cortical and subcortical regions, often in an asymmetric distribution\u2014particularly in the parietal and frontal lobes. Patients with CBD may present with unilateral motor deficits, limb apraxia, and cortical sensory loss, which correlate with the areas of atrophy noted on imaging studies. The \u2018abnormal moving hand\u2019 description is in line with the alien limb phenomenon typically encountered in CBD. Differential diagnoses include progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Distinguishing features include the asymmetry of motor symptoms and cortical sensory deficits in CBD, as well as characteristic imaging findings. MRI is used to identify asymmetrical atrophy, primarily in the parietal regions, which supports the diagnosis. There is no disease-modifying treatment for CBD; management is largely supportive, focusing on symptomatic relief with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Pharmacologic treatments may include low-dose levodopa for motor symptoms; however, responses are often limited. In pregnancy and lactation, management remains supportive, as many of the agents used (if any) have limited safety data and the progressive nature of CBD itself necessitates a multidisciplinary approach. Option A, 'Asymmetrical parietal atrophy', is the best-supported MRI finding in CBD. Other options might include symmetric cerebral atrophy or atrophy in regions less typically involved in CBD. The asymmetry and parietal focus support the clinical diagnosis of CBD when correlated with the patient\u2019s presentation. 1. CBD typically presents with asymmetric motor and cortical signs, and the alien limb phenomenon is a notable feature. 2. MRI findings of asymmetric parietal (often with frontal) atrophy strongly support the diagnosis. Emerging research into tauopathies continues to refine the imaging criteria for CBD, with newer MRI techniques improving diagnostic accuracy. Latest consensus guidelines underscore the importance of correlating clinical findings with neuroimaging features in suspected CBD cases.",

    "explanation": "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is an atypical parkinsonian disorder distinct from idiopathic Parkinson disease and vascular parkinsonism. It is characterized clinically by early frequent falls, axial rigidity, and notably, vertical gaze palsy (especially impaired upgaze). PSP is a tauopathy in which abnormal accumulation of tau protein leads to neurodegeneration in specific brain regions including the midbrain, basal ganglia, and brainstem. The involvement of the vertical gaze centers in the midbrain underlies the characteristic gaze palsy, while widespread tau accumulation contributes to balance and postural control issues. Patients typically present with early postural instability (resulting in falls), difficulty with eye movements (especially impaired upgaze), and a poor response to levodopa therapy. Despite the patient\u2019s history of coronary artery bypass grafting\u2014a marker of vascular risk\u2014the specific ocular motor abnormalities (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy) strongly favor PSP over vascular parkinsonism. Diagnosis is largely clinical. Differential diagnoses include idiopathic Parkinson disease (which generally shows a sustained response to levodopa), vascular parkinsonism (associated with lower body predominance and stepwise progression, often without vertical gaze palsy), and multiple system atrophy. Brain MRI in PSP may reveal midbrain atrophy with the 'hummingbird' or 'penguin' sign. There is no disease-modifying treatment for PSP. Management is symptomatic and supportive. Levodopa trials may be attempted but usually provide minimal benefit. The primary management focuses on fall prevention, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. There are ongoing clinical trials targeting tau pathology. In the rare case of pregnancy or lactation (which is generally not applicable for PSP given the typical age group), treatment would be highly individualized, and non-pharmacologic support would be emphasized. Option A (Vascular Parkinson) is less consistent because vascular parkinsonism typically lacks vertical gaze palsy and has a different distribution of motor symptoms. Option B (PSP) is correct given the hallmark features of restricted vertical gaze and early falls. Options C and D are not provided. 1. Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, particularly impaired upgaze, is highly suggestive of PSP. 2. Early frequent falls in an elderly patient with parkinsonian features should prompt consideration of PSP. Recent research has focused on tau-targeted therapies for PSP, though no approved disease-modifying treatments exist. Advances in neuroimaging and biomarkers are improving diagnostic accuracy, but management remains primarily supportive.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Lance-Adams syndrome is a form of post-hypoxic myoclonus that typically develops in patients who have survived a period of significant cerebral hypoxia, such as after cardiac arrest. The syndrome is thought to result from hypoxic injury to inhibitory neuronal circuits in the cortex and subcortical structures. This injury leads to disinhibition of motor pathways, causing action or stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. The jerky movements especially appearing after sensory stimulation (like touching) are a clinical hallmark. In survivors of cardiac arrest, the presence of sudden, jerky, stimulus-sensitive movements is characteristic of Lance-Adams syndrome. Such myoclonus typically appears during recovery from hypoxic injury and may be exacerbated by voluntary movement or sensory triggers. The diagnosis is made clinically based on the history of a hypoxic event (e.g., cardiac arrest) along with the presence of characteristic myoclonus. Differential diagnoses include epileptic myoclonus, cerebellar myoclonus, and other post-hypoxic movement disorders. EEG may help exclude an ongoing seizure disorder. Management is primarily symptomatic. First-line treatment options include medications such as levetiracetam and clonazepam, which have been shown to reduce myoclonus. Valproate is another option though caution is advised in women of childbearing age due to teratogenic risks. In cases involving pregnancy or lactation, treatment choices must weigh the potential risks versus benefits, and non-pharmacological strategies should be considered when possible. Option A (Lance-Adams syndrome) is correct because the history of cardiac arrest and the description of stimulus-sensitive jerky movements are classic for this condition. Other options are not provided, but they would likely include other causes of myoclonus that do not fit the clinical scenario. 1. Post-hypoxic myoclonus (Lance-Adams syndrome) often develops in patients recovering from cardiac arrest. 2. The myoclonus is typically stimulus-sensitive, appearing when the patient is touched or performs voluntary movement. Recent studies have supported the role of medications like levetiracetam in managing post-hypoxic myoclonus. Ongoing research is further elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this syndrome, which may lead to more targeted therapeutic interventions in the future.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson disease (PD) is primarily a clinical diagnosis characterized by a triad of motor symptoms: bradykinesia, rigidity, and rest tremor. The response to dopaminergic therapies, especially levodopa, also supports the diagnosis. PD is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the formation of Lewy bodies. The resulting dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia circuitry is responsible for the motor symptoms observed. The typical presentation includes tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Along with these features, a positive and sustained improvement with dopaminergic therapy (e.g., levodopa/carbidopa) helps confirm the diagnosis. The patient\u2019s age and symptom profile are consistent with a clinical diagnosis of PD. While the diagnosis of PD is primarily clinical, differentials include atypical parkinsonian syndromes (e.g., PSP, multiple system atrophy), drug-induced parkinsonism, and vascular parkinsonism. Advanced imaging modalities such as DaTscan (a form of SPECT imaging) may be used in atypical or uncertain cases. Levodopa/Carbidopa remains the gold standard for symptomatic management of PD. In younger patients or in early stages, dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors might be considered; however, levodopa is preferred once motor symptoms become more pronounced. Pregnancy and lactation considerations are important; while levodopa is typically avoided during pregnancy if possible, the benefits and risks must be weighed carefully, and if required, it can be used with close monitoring. Option A (Levodopa/Carbidopa) is correct as it is the appropriate first-line therapy for a patient with a typical presentation of Parkinson disease. Option B, which adds Entacapone (a COMT inhibitor), is usually reserved for managing motor fluctuations in more advanced stages. Option C (PET Scan) is not necessary for the routine diagnosis of PD given its clinical nature. 1. A positive response to levodopa supports the diagnosis of Parkinson disease. 2. The diagnosis is largely clinical, with imaging reserved for atypical cases. Recent guidelines from movement disorder societies continue to recommend levodopa/carbidopa as the most effective agent for symptomatic relief in PD. Research is ongoing to refine early diagnostic biomarkers and explore neuroprotective strategies, but management still hinges on symptomatic treatment.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "In Parkinson disease patients, the development of hallucinations combined with memory problems is highly suggestive of Parkinson disease dementia (PDD). Rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of cognitive impairment in PD, including improvements in attention and executive function. PDD involves both dopaminergic and cholinergic deficits. The cholinergic deficiency in cortical and subcortical regions contributes to memory impairment and may also play a role in visual hallucinations. Rivastigmine works by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby improving cholinergic transmission. Patients with PDD often exhibit a constellation of symptoms including memory loss, confusion, and visual hallucinations, in addition to the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease. Treating the cognitive component with a cholinesterase inhibitor like rivastigmine can improve both cognitive symptoms and, in some cases, psychotic features. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria after a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Differential diagnoses include dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer disease, and medication-induced psychosis. Detailed history, cognitive testing, and review of medications are essential for accurate diagnosis. Rivastigmine is the first-line pharmacologic treatment approved for PDD. It is used to alleviate cognitive symptoms and may have a beneficial effect on associated visual hallucinations. In cases where hallucinations are prominent and distressing without significant cognitive decline, atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine or low-dose clozapine may be considered, but these carry a risk of worsening parkinsonian motor symptoms. In pregnant or lactating women, use of cholinesterase inhibitors is generally avoided due to limited safety data, and alternative management strategies should be considered. Option A (Rivastigmine) is correct as it addresses the dual concerns of memory impairment and hallucinations in Parkinson disease dementia. Option B (Quetiapine) and Option C (Clozapine) are antipsychotics that might be used for psychosis but do not improve the cognitive deficits and may exacerbate motor symptoms if not used judiciously. 1. Rivastigmine is the only cholinesterase inhibitor specifically approved for Parkinson disease dementia. 2. In PD patients, antipsychotics must be used with caution due to the risk of worsening motor symptoms. Recent research continues to support the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors like rivastigmine in improving the cognitive symptoms of PDD. Efforts are ongoing to better delineate treatment algorithms that minimize adverse effects on motor function while addressing neuropsychiatric symptoms.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "Wearing off phenomenon",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "In Parkinson\u2019s disease, the therapeutic benefit of levodopa diminishes before the next scheduled dose. This phenomenon\u2014where patients experience a return of motor symptoms such as rigidity and tremors as the medication effect wanes\u2014is known as the wearing\u2010off phenomenon. It is distinct from other levodopa\u2010related complications. Chronic levodopa therapy leads to fluctuations in plasma and brain dopamine levels due to its short half\u2010life. With disease progression and loss of buffering capacity in the dopaminergic pathways, there is a predictable decline in motor control before the next dose. This contrasts with phenomena like peak\u2010dose dyskinesia (dyskinesias at maximal drug concentration) or the on\u2010off phenomenon (sudden, unpredictable changes between mobility and immobility). Patients experiencing wearing-off phenomenon typically report a gradual return of Parkinsonian symptoms (rigidity, tremors, bradykinesia) near the end of a dosing interval. The timing is predictable, often about 30\u201360 minutes before the next dose, which is exactly the scenario described. The differential includes: 1) Peak-dose dyskinesia (involuntary movements when levodopa concentration peaks), 2) On\u2013off phenomenon (sudden, unpredictable motor fluctuations), and 3) Non-motor fluctuations. A detailed history noting the timing of symptom recurrence relative to medication dosing is key to differentiation. Management involves optimizing the dopaminergic regimen. First-line strategies include fractionating the levodopa dose into smaller, more frequent administrations and the addition of adjunctive medications such as dopamine agonists, COMT inhibitors (e.g., entacapone), or MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline). In pregnancy or lactation, the risk\u2013benefit ratio of dopaminergic therapies must be carefully considered, using the lowest effective dose and consulting current obstetric guidelines to minimize fetal exposure while managing maternal symptoms. Option A (Peak dose dyskinesia) is incorrect because it refers to involuntary movements at maximum levodopa effect rather than the return of parkinsonian symptoms before the next dose. Option B (On & off phenomena) is also incorrect; although it describes fluctuations, the on\u2013off phenomenon is characterized by abrupt and unpredictable switches between mobility and immobility. The scenario described is the classical wearing\u2010off phenomenon, which is predictable and timed with the dosing interval. 1) Wearing\u2010off is characterized by a predictable decline in the drug effect before the next scheduled dose. 2) Adjusting dosing schedules and using adjunct therapies can effectively smooth out motor fluctuations. 3) Distinguishing between wearing\u2010off, peak-dose dyskinesia, and on\u2013off phenomenon is critical for proper management. Recent research emphasizes the importance of continuous dopaminergic stimulation to reduce motor fluctuations. Advances in drug delivery systems (e.g., enteral levodopa infusion) and adjunctive therapies are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Guidelines continue to recommend individualized therapy adjustments with attention to patient-specific daily fluctuations.",

    "explanation": "A thorough evaluation is critical when addressing neurological symptoms. In this case, a 'thin tall' patient with ataxia is mentioned but key historical details, physical examination findings, and investigations are missing. Without sufficient data, making a specific diagnosis or treatment recommendation is not possible. Ataxia can result from a variety of etiologies including genetic, metabolic, immunological, or structural abnormalities. Each has different underlying mechanisms ranging from cerebellar degeneration to demyelination. Without details, the precise pathophysiologic basis cannot be determined. Ataxia manifests as uncoordinated movement and gait instability; however, the significance of the patient\u2019s body habitus ('thin tall') may imply a connective tissue or genetic disorder (e.g., fragile X\u2013associated tremor/ataxia syndrome or even vitamin E deficiency in abetalipoproteinemia), but these are only speculative without additional clinical data. The evaluation should include a detailed history (including family history, onset, and progression), a complete neurological examination, neuroimaging (MRI to assess cerebellar or white matter changes), laboratory tests (including vitamins, metabolic panels), and possibly genetic testing. Differential diagnoses might include inherited ataxias (such as spinocerebellar ataxia), vitamin deficiencies, demyelinating diseases, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Treatment principles vary widely. For example, if a vitamin deficiency is identified, supplementation is the mainstay. If the ataxia is genetic, supportive care and physical therapy are recommended. Immunotherapy may be used if an autoimmune process is identified. In pregnancy or lactation, treatment adjustments must be made to avoid teratogenic effects and drug toxicity in the infant; hence, definitive diagnosis is imperative before initiating any specific treatment. Since no treatment options are provided and all available choices (including empirical therapies like vitamin supplementation, physical therapy, disease-modifying agents, or immunotherapy) depend on the specific diagnosis, the most appropriate answer is that there is insufficient data to recommend any treatment. 1) Always obtain a complete history and thorough workup before deciding on a management plan in neurology. 2) Ataxia is a common final pathway for many distinct etiologies. 3) Empirical treatment without a definitive diagnosis can lead to mismanagement and potential harm. Recent guidelines stress the necessity of identifying the underlying cause of ataxia prior to therapy, with research continually evolving in the fields of genetic ataxias and novel biomarkers. Multidisciplinary evaluation, including neurology, genetics, and sometimes immunology, is recommended to tailor management.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Paroxysmal dyskinesias are episodic movement disorders characterized by sudden, brief attacks of abnormal involuntary movements. Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) specifically is triggered by sudden voluntary movements. PKD is thought to result from transient dysfunction in neuronal excitability within basal ganglia circuits. Mutations in the PRRT2 gene are often implicated, leading to abnormal synaptic function. This results in sudden alterations in motor control when triggered by movement. The presented 14\u2010year-old patient with brief episodes of jerky movements and dystonia triggered by turning while running is typical for PKD. The short, kinesigenic-triggered episodes, along with a family history of migraine (often seen in association with PKD), support this diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include epileptic attacks, other forms of paroxysmal dyskinesia (such as non-kinesigenic variants), and exercise-induced dystonia. A careful clinical history noting that episodes are precipitated by movement, their short duration, and normal consciousness during episodes helps differentiate PKD from seizures. Neuroimaging is often normal in PKD. First-line management for PKD typically involves low-dose antiepileptic drugs, with carbamazepine being the most commonly used and effective agent. Other medications like phenytoin or oxcarbazepine may be considered if needed. In pregnant or lactating women, carbamazepine is generally considered relatively safe (Pregnancy Category D in some contexts but may be used if benefits outweigh risks with appropriate monitoring) and alternative agents should be considered based on individual risk profiles and current obstetrical guidelines. Option A, paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, is correct as it directly matches the description of sudden, movement-triggered dyskinetic episodes. The absence of additional options does not detract from the correctness of this diagnosis based on the clinical scenario provided. 1) PKD episodes are brief and triggered by sudden voluntary movements. 2) A positive family history (such as migraine) can be a useful clinical clue. 3) Carbamazepine is the first-line treatment with a good response in PKD. Recent genetic research has increasingly implicated PRRT2 mutations in PKD, reinforcing the genetic basis of the condition. Current guidelines support the use of carbamazepine as the first-line agent, with ongoing studies aimed at refining treatment protocols and understanding long-term outcomes.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Familial Parkinson\u2019s disease has both idiopathic and genetic forms. Among the genetic associations, mutations in the LRRK2 gene are one of the most common, particularly in autosomal dominant cases. Mutations in the LRRK2 gene result in a gain-of-function that leads to abnormal kinase activity, ultimately contributing to dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra. This mechanism is similar in both familial and sporadic forms of Parkinson\u2019s and is the focus of current research for targeted therapies. Patients with LRRK2-associated Parkinson\u2019s typically present with a classic Parkinsonian syndrome (rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) that is similar to idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. Familial history further supports the genetic etiology. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by family history and, increasingly, genetic testing for mutations in LRRK2. Differential diagnoses include other genetic forms of Parkinson\u2019s such as those associated with SNCA, Parkin, or PINK1 mutations. Genetic counseling is recommended for familial cases. The management of LRRK2-associated Parkinson\u2019s disease is similar to idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. First-line treatments include levodopa preparations, dopamine agonists, and other symptomatic therapies. While no gene-specific treatments are approved yet, research into LRRK2 inhibitors is underway. In pregnant or lactating patients, careful consideration of medication safety is crucial, with the goal of using the minimum effective dosage and monitoring closely per current obstetric neurology guidelines. Option A (LRRK2) is correct because LRRK2 is one of the most commonly implicated genes in familial Parkinson\u2019s disease. Other options (not provided) may represent other genes; however, the consensus in current literature supports LRRK2 as a key genetic factor. 1) LRRK2 mutations account for a significant portion of familial Parkinson\u2019s disease, particularly with autosomal dominant inheritance. 2) The clinical picture generally mirrors idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s, though a positive family history is the clue. 3) Genetic testing and counseling are important in familial cases. Emerging studies are focusing on the development of LRRK2 inhibitors, which may offer disease-specific therapy in the future. Current guidelines continue to recommend standard symptomatic treatments while emphasizing the role of genetic counseling and research participation.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Lithium is a cornerstone mood stabilizer used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It is well known for its narrow therapeutic index and side effect profile, with tremor being the most frequently encountered neurological side effect. Lithium interferes with ion channels and neurotransmitter regulation in the central nervous system, leading to increased neuromuscular excitability that manifests as a fine tremor. The tremor is dose-dependent and often appears or worsens with increases in serum lithium levels. Patients on lithium therapy frequently report a fine, predominantly postural or action tremor. This is one of the earliest and most common side effects, and its recognition is important to avoid confusion with signs of toxicity. The approach involves reviewing the patient\u2019s medication history, assessing serum lithium levels, and differentiating lithium-induced tremor from other causes such as essential tremor, hyperthyroidism, or other drug-induced tremors. Regular monitoring helps in early detection and management. Management includes dose adjustment if serum levels are high and/or the addition of symptomatic treatments such as beta blockers (e.g., propranolol). In pregnancy and lactation, lithium use requires careful risk-benefit assessment due to potential teratogenic effects. When managing tremor during these periods, both lithium levels and the safety profile of any adjunct therapy (like beta blockers) must be carefully monitored. Option A (Tremor) is correct because it is by far the most common side effect observed with lithium therapy. Options B (Seizure), C (Ataxia), and D (Encephalopathy) are far less frequent and are more typically associated with lithium toxicity rather than its common side effect profile. \u2022 Lithium-induced tremor is typically dose-related and can often be controlled with beta blockers. \u2022 Regular monitoring of serum lithium levels is crucial to prevent both subtherapeutic dosing and toxicity. \u2022 Early recognition of tremor can prompt preemptive dose adjustments. The latest research underlines the significance of monitoring lithium levels and dose-dependent adverse effects, with current clinical guidelines recommending beta blockers such as propranolol for managing tremor, provided the patient\u2019s overall clinical status, including pregnancy considerations, is closely evaluated.",
