    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This question targets the evaluation of an acute neuromuscular weakness episode that follows vigorous exercise. In conditions such as hypokalemic periodic paralysis\u2014a channelopathy that can be triggered by strenuous exercise\u2014an abnormal shift in potassium is key. Therefore, the first diagnostic step is to check serum potassium levels. In hypokalemic periodic paralysis, defective voltage\u2010gated ion channels lead to an abnormal intracellular shift of potassium after triggers such as vigorous exercise or high carbohydrate meals. This drop in extracellular potassium results in decreased membrane excitability, leading to transient, generalized muscle weakness. Both familial forms (often autosomal dominant) and secondary causes (e.g., thyrotoxicosis) exist. Patients typically present with sudden onset, generalized weakness after exercise or carbohydrate ingestion. Recognition of these triggers and the associated clinical picture directs the clinician to measure serum potassium, as abnormal levels confirm the suspicion and guide prompt management. While the clinical presentation may raise broad differentials such as myasthenia gravis, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, or even central causes of weakness, evaluating serum electrolytes (especially potassium) narrows the diagnosis. Additional tests (e.g., thyroid function, genetic testing for channel mutations) can support the diagnosis in familial or thyrotoxic cases. Acute management involves correcting the hypokalemia under close monitoring using oral or intravenous potassium supplementation depending on severity. Long\u2010term strategies include trigger avoidance (e.g., strenuous exercise, high carbohydrate meals) and prophylactic therapies such as low\u2010dose acetazolamide. In pregnant or lactating patients, electrolyte correction should be done carefully with monitoring; acetazolamide is classified as Category C in pregnancy and should be used only if benefits outweigh risks. Option A (K levels) is correct. In a patient presenting with sudden weakness after exercise, the initial evaluation should include serum electrolyte testing, with potassium being of primary importance. The remaining options were not provided. 1. Always check for electrolyte abnormalities in patients with sudden-onset muscle weakness. 2. Vigorous exercise and high-carbohydrate meals are common triggers for hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Recent clinical guidelines emphasize early electrolyte evaluation in acute neuromuscular weakness. Genetic and molecular studies continue to elucidate the underlying channelopathies to improve targeted therapeutic strategies.",

    "question": "Case of a lady post hysterectomy presented with weakness in hip flexion and knee extension, what is the most likely injury in her procedure?",
    "option_a": "Femoral nerve",
    "option_b": "",
    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Postoperative nerve injuries are recognized complications, particularly following pelvic surgeries. The femoral nerve supplies key muscles required for hip flexion and knee extension. Thus, weakness in these muscle groups suggests an injury to that nerve. During surgical procedures like a hysterectomy, the femoral nerve (originating from the L2\u2013L4 nerve roots) may be compromised by mechanical stretch, compression, or inadvertent transection. This injury disrupts both the motor and sensory fibers of the nerve, leading to specific deficits. A patient with femoral nerve injury typically exhibits weakness in hip flexion (affecting muscles like the iliacus and sartorius) and knee extension (affecting the quadriceps femoris). This pattern of weakness, especially in the context of recent pelvic surgery, is strongly indicative of femoral neuropathy. Differentials include injuries of adjacent nerves such as the obturator nerve (which would cause weakness in thigh adduction) or the sciatic nerve (affecting the posterior compartment of the thigh and lower leg). A detailed neurological exam complemented by electrodiagnostic studies (EMG and nerve conduction studies) helps localize the lesion. Initial management involves conservative measures like physical therapy for strengthening and rehabilitation, along with pain management. In severe cases, surgical repair or decompression may be warranted. In pregnant or lactating patients, conservative management and physiotherapy are preferred due to the safety profiles of these interventions. Option A (Femoral nerve) is correct, given that the femoral nerve is responsible for hip flexion and knee extension. The weakness pattern following a hysterectomy is most consistent with a femoral nerve injury. 1. Postoperative patients presenting with leg weakness should be evaluated for iatrogenic nerve injuries. 2. The femoral nerve specifically mediates knee extension and contributes to hip flexion. Recent studies and guidelines emphasize the importance of early diagnosis using EMG to determine the extent of nerve injury and to guide timely rehabilitative therapy, which can significantly improve functional outcomes.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "The pattern of muscle weakness is essential in localizing peripheral nerve lesions. Weak hip adductor muscles point to an injury of the nerve that innervates them. The obturator nerve, arising from the L2\u2013L4 roots, innervates the medial compartment of the thigh, including the adductor muscle group. Injury to this nerve impairs the adduction of the thigh, disrupting normal gait and balance. Patients with an obturator neuropathy typically exhibit weak or absent thigh adduction and may complain of instability or difficulty in activities involving side-to-side leg movements. The differential diagnosis includes femoral nerve injury (which affects knee extension and hip flexion) and lumbosacral radiculopathy. Detailed neurological examination, coupled with nerve conduction studies and electromyography, helps differentiate these conditions. Management is typically conservative, involving physical therapy to strengthen surrounding muscles and improve balance. In cases of severe or persistent deficits, nerve blocks or surgical intervention may be considered. For pregnant or lactating patients, non-invasive therapies such as physiotherapy are preferred. Option A (Obturator nerve) is correct because the obturator nerve is solely responsible for the innervation of the hip adductors. 1. Weakness in hip adduction is a hallmark of obturator nerve dysfunction. 2. A meticulous neurological exam is critical in differentiating peripheral nerve injuries. Current research and clinical guidelines support early physiotherapy in the management of nerve injuries to enhance recovery and prevent long-term disability.",

    "question": "Scenario of Kennedy disease (gynecomastia and family history) which of the following is correct",
    "option_a": "High androgen",
    "option_b": "Normal CK",
    "option_c": "High aldolase",
    "option_d": "High aromatase",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Kennedy disease, also known as spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive lower motor neuron degeneration along with features of partial androgen insensitivity such as gynecomastia. Laboratory abnormalities, reflecting muscle breakdown, are important diagnostic clues. Kennedy disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome. The resulting mutant receptor causes a toxic gain-of-function in motor neurons. Despite the receptor mutation, circulating levels of androgens (testosterone) are typically normal or slightly low, leading to clinical features like gynecomastia due to relative androgen insensitivity and altered estrogen to androgen ratios. Muscle degeneration often results in elevated muscle enzymes. Patients with Kennedy disease usually develop slowly progressive weakness (affecting bulbar and limb muscles), fasciculations, and endocrine abnormalities such as gynecomastia. Laboratory findings include elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) and often increased aldolase due to ongoing muscle breakdown. Differential diagnoses include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), other motor neuron diseases, and myopathies. The presence of endocrine features (gynecomastia) alongside a family history and genetic testing confirming a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene are key to diagnosis. Elevated muscle enzymes (CK and aldolase) further support the diagnosis. Management is primarily supportive and involves physical therapy, occupational therapy, and symptomatic treatment. There is currently no cure, though research is ongoing into androgen receptor modulation. Endocrine symptoms such as gynecomastia can be managed symptomatically if desired. In pregnant or lactating patients, supportive measures and physiotherapy remain the mainstays of treatment, with careful consideration given to the safety of any experimental therapies. Option A (High androgen) is incorrect because patients with Kennedy disease typically have normal or lower testosterone levels due to ineffective androgen receptor signaling. Option B (Normal CK) is incorrect since muscle enzyme levels, particularly CK, are usually elevated due to muscle degeneration. Option C (High aldolase) is the most consistent with laboratory findings in Kennedy disease, as muscle breakdown often results in increased aldolase levels. Option D (High aromatase) does not align with the established pathophysiology of Kennedy disease. 1. Kennedy disease presents with lower motor neuron signs and endocrine abnormalities (gynecomastia) despite normal or low circulating androgens. 2. Elevated muscle enzymes (CK and aldolase) are common laboratory findings, and genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Recent studies continue to focus on the molecular underpinnings of Kennedy disease and investigate targeted therapies aimed at modulating androgen receptor toxicity. Current guidelines emphasize supportive care and early intervention to maintain function, while experimental therapies are under investigation.",

    "question": "Scenario of myotonia worsen by exercising",

    "option_b": "",
    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Myotonia refers to the delayed relaxation of muscles after voluntary contraction. Myotonic disorders are a group of neuromuscular diseases that share this characteristic, though triggers and response patterns vary between subtypes. In the case of paramyotonia congenita, myotonia worsens with repeated exercise and exposure to cold rather than improving (the so\u2010called 'warm\u2010up phenomenon' seen in other forms such as myotonia congenita). Paramyotonia congenita is most commonly linked to mutations in the SCN4A gene, which encodes the skeletal muscle sodium channel. These mutations lead to abnormal channel inactivation and persistent depolarization, resulting in muscle stiffness that paradoxically becomes more pronounced with exercise and in cold environments. This abnormal channel gating underlies the characteristic worsening of symptoms. Clinically, patients with paramyotonia congenita present with muscle stiffness, often triggered or exacerbated by exercise and cold temperatures. This distinguishes it from conditions like classic myotonia congenita, where the warm\u2010up phenomenon (improvement with repeated contraction) is observed. On physical examination and electromyography (EMG), myotonic discharges are typically evident. The diagnostic workup begins with a detailed clinical history noting the trigger of symptoms by exercise (and cold exposure), followed by physical examination. EMG is used to document myotonic discharges. Genetic testing can subsequently confirm a mutation in the SCN4A gene. Differential diagnoses include myotonic dystrophies and other non\u2010dystrophic myotonias, which are differentiated by associated systemic features or differing exercise responses. Management is largely symptomatic. First\u2010line interventions include advising patients to avoid cold exposure and strenuous exercise that triggers symptoms. Mexiletine, a sodium channel blocker, is often considered the drug of choice for managing myotonia. In pregnancy and lactation, careful consideration of medication safety is essential; mexiletine\u2019s use should be evaluated against potential risks to the fetus or infant, and alternative management strategies or doses may be employed per current obstetric guidelines. Option A (Paramyotonia congenita) is correct because it directly describes a condition where myotonia worsens with exercise and cold, matching the scenario provided. No other options were provided for comparison. 1) In paramyotonia congenita, myotonia worsens with continued use (exercise) rather than improving. 2) Cold exposure is a frequent trigger for symptomatic exacerbation. 3) EMG findings with myotonic discharges can help clinch the diagnosis. Recent research continues to focus on the molecular genetics of SCN4A mutations and the development of targeted therapies. Updated guidelines recommend lifestyle modifications as a cornerstone of management, with mexiletine being the first-line pharmacologic therapy, though its use in pregnant or lactating women should involve a risk-benefit analysis.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem disorder that classically features myotonia, distal muscle weakness, cataracts, endocrine abnormalities (such as diabetes mellitus), and other systemic manifestations. Its genetic basis is central to understanding its clinical syndrome. DM1 is caused by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. The expanded repeat results in the accumulation of toxic RNA transcripts that interfere with normal splicing of several genes, leading to a wide variety of clinical manifestations. The phenomenon of anticipation, where symptoms worsen and appear earlier in successive generations, is well recognized. Typical clinical features include distal weakness of the upper and lower limbs, myotonia (often clinically evident on EMG), early-onset cataracts, and the presence of diabetes mellitus. This constellation of features is highly suggestive of myotonic dystrophy type 1. The diagnosis of DM1 is confirmed by genetic testing for the CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. Differential diagnoses include myotonic dystrophy type 2, which is due to a CCTG repeat expansion and generally presents with proximal weakness and milder symptoms. Management involves a multidisciplinary approach addressing muscular, cardiac, endocrine, and ocular manifestations. Regular cardiac monitoring, physical therapy, and endocrine evaluations are recommended. Genetic counseling is essential, especially regarding the risks associated with congenital myotonic dystrophy in offspring. For pregnant or lactating patients, careful management and monitoring are required as the disease can influence obstetric outcomes and may necessitate more frequent prenatal assessments. Option A (CTG) is correct as it identifies the CTG trinucleotide expansion in the DMPK gene, which is the causative mutation in myotonic dystrophy type 1. Option B (CCTG) is linked to myotonic dystrophy type 2. 1) DM1 is characterized by a CTG repeat expansion leading to multisystem involvement. 2) The phenomenon of anticipation is key in understanding the disease\u2019s progression. 3) Multidisciplinary management is critical due to its systemic manifestations. Current guidelines emphasize genetic counseling and regular multisystem surveillance in patients with DM1. New therapies targeting the toxic RNA effects are under investigation, but supportive care remains the mainstay of treatment.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) refers to a clinical syndrome primarily affecting the bulbar muscles, which are responsible for functions such as speech and swallowing. This syndrome represents one of the phenotypes within the spectrum of motor neuron diseases. PBP is caused by the degeneration of lower motor neurons in the brainstem, particularly affecting the cranial nerve nuclei. Its pathophysiology overlaps with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and indeed many experts consider PBP to be a variant or a form of bulbar-onset ALS. Patients present with dysarthria (difficulty speaking), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and other bulbar signs, often without initial limb involvement. The clinical course is typically progressive, and over time, some patients may develop additional motor neuron signs in other regions. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination, supplemented by electromyography (EMG) and neuroimaging to exclude structural brainstem lesions. Differential diagnoses include myasthenia gravis, brainstem strokes, and other neuromuscular junction disorders. The absence of fluctuating weakness and a lack of response to cholinesterase inhibitors help exclude myasthenia gravis. Management is primarily supportive. First-line therapies include multidisciplinary supportive care with speech and swallowing therapy. Pharmacologic agents approved for ALS, such as riluzole (and in some regions edaravone), may be initiated to slow disease progression. In pregnancy and lactation, these medications are used with caution due to limited safety data, and supportive management is emphasized along with a careful risk-benefit analysis. Option A (progressive bulbar palsy) is correct for a case presenting exclusively with bulbar signs and progressive weakness in these muscles. Option B (bulbar onset ALS) is a term used synonymously by many clinicians; however, given the scenario clearly outlines a progressive bulbar picture, Option A accurately reflects the intended diagnosis according to the clinical description. 1) Isolated bulbar symptoms in an adult should raise suspicion for motor neuron disease. 2) PBP is often a precursor to more generalized ALS over time. 3) Differentiation from neuromuscular junction disorders is crucial due to significantly different management strategies. Recent updates in the classification of motor neuron diseases recognize progressive bulbar palsy as part of the spectrum of ALS. Ongoing research into disease-modifying treatments continues, although current standard care remains predominantly supportive.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Certain antibodies are associated with specific types of peripheral neuropathies. In the context of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies, anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (Anti-MAG) antibodies are particularly relevant, especially in patients with IgM-monoclonal gammopathy. Anti-MAG antibodies target the myelin-associated glycoprotein, a component critical for maintaining the integrity of the myelin sheath in peripheral nerves. Binding of these antibodies leads to demyelination, resulting in progressive and often slowly progressive neuropathic symptoms such as sensory ataxia and tremor. Clinically, patients with anti-MAG antibody-associated neuropathy typically present with symptoms such as distal sensory loss, ataxia, and sometimes mild motor involvement. The course is generally chronic and slowly progressive. This is distinct from other neuropathies that may present with rapid onset or primarily motor features. Diagnosis involves a thorough clinical evaluation combined with nerve conduction studies that reveal a demyelinating pattern. Serologic testing for anti-MAG antibodies is pivotal in confirming the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and neuropathies associated with other autoantibodies such as anti-GD1, which are more commonly linked to variants of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Management strategies vary by severity. In mild cases, observation and symptomatic treatment may suffice. In more progressive cases, therapies include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and rituximab as potential second-line agents. In pregnant or lactating patients, IVIG is generally considered safe, while the use of rituximab requires thorough counseling due to limited safety data during pregnancy, mandating a careful risk-benefit assessment. Option A (Anti-MAG) is correct because anti-MAG antibodies are the established serological marker for this type of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Option B (Anti-GD1) is more commonly associated with acute motor axonal neuropathy or other variants of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, making Option A the appropriate choice. 1) Anti-MAG antibodies are a key marker for a subset of demyelinating neuropathies associated with IgM paraproteinemia. 2) Nerve conduction studies help differentiate demyelinating from axonal neuropathies. 3) Treatment is tailored based on severity and patient tolerance, especially in special populations like pregnant women. Latest research supports the use of rituximab in patients with progressive, disabling anti-MAG neuropathy, although controlled studies are ongoing. Guidelines continue to stress the importance of individualized management plans and caution when treating special populations.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This scenario describes a multi\u2010system process including cardiac enlargement (cardiomegaly), bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral sensory polyneuropathy, autonomic symptoms, and a family history of similar symptoms. These features are classical for transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis, particularly the hereditary form, where mutated transthyretin protein misfolds and deposits in multiple tissues. Mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene produce a protein that tends to misfold and aggregate into amyloid fibrils. These fibrils deposit in the myocardium, peripheral nerves, and other tissues, leading to cardiomyopathy, neuropathy (both sensory and autonomic) and musculoskeletal symptoms like carpal tunnel syndrome. Both wild\u2010type and hereditary forms exist, with the hereditary type showing autosomal dominant transmission. Patients typically present with heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias (due to myocardial infiltration), bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and signs of peripheral/autonomic neuropathy such as orthostatic hypotension. A family history positive for similar issues strongly points toward hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. This collection of findings should trigger targeted testing. Evaluation begins with noninvasive cardiac imaging such as echocardiography and nuclear scintigraphy (e.g., technetium\u2010pyrophosphate scans). To confirm the diagnosis in a patient with a suggestive clinical picture and family history, genetic testing for TTR mutations is indicated. Differential diagnoses include AL (light\u2010chain) amyloidosis, which may have similar cardiac and systemic manifestations but is distinguished by its laboratory and biopsy findings. Management includes both supportive measures and disease\u2010modifying therapies. Current guidelines recommend TTR stabilizers (e.g., tafamidis) for reducing disease progression, and gene-silencing therapies (patisiran or inotersen) have also been approved. In patients with advanced cardiac involvement, heart transplantation may be considered. In pregnancy and lactation, medications like tafamidis and gene-silencing agents lack robust safety data; hence, treatment decisions must balance maternal benefits and potential fetal risks, usually favoring postponement until after delivery if possible. Option A, Transthyretin, is appropriate because ordering a test focused on transthyretin (genetic sequencing or serum protein evaluation for amyloid typing) is the correct next step in evaluating a suspected case of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. The other options (B, C, and D) are not provided, but given the clinical scenario, A is the most accurate. 1) Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome in the setting of cardiomyopathy is a red flag for amyloidosis. 2) A positive family history should prompt evaluation for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. 3) Early diagnosis is critical as disease-modifying therapies can slow progression. Recent studies have validated the efficacy of tafamidis in reducing mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. Additionally, emerging data on gene-silencing therapies have broadened the therapeutic options, though their use in pregnancy remains uncharted and should be approached with caution.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This case involves a patient over 50 years old with weakness primarily in the hand flexors and quadriceps. These specific muscle groups are classically affected in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), which is the most common acquired inflammatory myopathy in older adults. IBM is characterized by both inflammatory and degenerative processes. Muscle biopsy typically shows endomysial inflammation, rimmed vacuoles, and amyloid deposits within muscle fibers. The exact mechanism remains complex, involving autoimmunity as well as protein aggregation leading to myofiber degeneration. Clinically, IBM presents with slowly progressive, often asymmetric weakness that predominantly affects the finger flexors and quadriceps. Patients may have difficulty with tasks such as gripping objects and stair climbing. The disease mainly affects men over the age of 50 and is usually refractory to immunosuppressive treatments. Diagnosis is established by muscle biopsy, which reveals characteristic findings such as endomysial inflammation and rimmed vacuoles. Although serum creatine kinase is often modestly elevated, it is not diagnostic. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis or other inflammatory myopathies; however, these conditions typically do not involve the finger flexors to the same extent. Treatment options are limited. Immunosuppressive therapies, such as corticosteroids, have generally failed to produce significant improvement. Current management focuses on supportive care and physical therapy to maintain function. In select cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be tried, though responses are inconsistent. Pregnancy and lactation require careful management\u2014the use of immunosuppressive medications is generally minimized due to potential risks, and supportive therapy is the mainstay during such periods. Option A, IBM, is correct because the pattern of weakness (involving both hand (finger) flexors and quadriceps) in an older male fits the clinical picture of Inclusion Body Myositis. Other potential options, like polymyositis, do not typically demonstrate the specific involvement of finger flexors. 1) IBM is the most common inflammatory myopathy in patients older than 50. 2) Finger flexor weakness along with quadriceps weakness is highly suggestive of IBM. 3) Immunosuppressive therapies are generally ineffective, emphasizing the role of supportive care. Recent research has emphasized the limited role of immunosuppressives in IBM. There is ongoing investigation into targeted therapies aimed at the degenerative aspects of the disease, but to date, no treatment has consistently altered disease progression. Supportive management including tailored physical therapy remains the mainstay.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Central core myopathy is a congenital myopathy that is often associated with mutations in the RYR1 gene. A distinctive feature of this condition is its association with malignant hyperthermia, a potentially life\u2010threatening reaction to certain anesthetic agents. Mutations in the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) disrupt normal calcium handling within skeletal muscle fibers, leading to structural abnormalities called 'cores' where there is diminished oxidative enzyme activity. This defect predisposes patients to an abnormal response to anesthesia, which can trigger malignant hyperthermia. Patients with central core myopathy often present with hypotonia, proximal muscle weakness, and sometimes delayed motor milestones from infancy. A history of malignant hyperthermia in the family is a critical clinical clue. The condition is typically static or slowly progressive and should alert clinicians to avoid triggering anesthetic agents. Definitive diagnosis is made via muscle biopsy, which reveals central areas within muscle fibers that lack normal enzyme activity (central cores). Genetic testing for RYR1 mutations is also available. Differential diagnoses include other congenital myopathies such as nemaline myopathy or multi-minicore disease, which can be distinguished based on histological patterns and genetic testing. The primary management strategy is preventative\u2014specifically, the avoidance of anesthetic agents known to precipitate malignant hyperthermia (e.g., succinylcholine and volatile anesthetics). Supportive treatments include physical therapy to improve muscle strength and function. In the context of pregnancy and lactation, careful planning of anesthesia is essential, and regional anesthesia may be preferred. A preoperative evaluation that includes a detailed family history is critical to prevent malignant hyperthermia episodes. Option A, Central core myopathy, is correct because the presentation, in conjunction with a family history of malignant hyperthermia, is most consistent with this diagnosis. The association between central core myopathy and RYR1 mutations makes this diagnosis the best fit for the scenario. 1) Always inquire about a family history of malignant hyperthermia in patients with congenital myopathies. 2) Central core myopathy is the most common congenital myopathy linked with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. 3) Avoidance of specific anesthetic agents can prevent life-threatening complications. Recent guidelines emphasize genetic testing for RYR1 mutations to confirm the diagnosis. There is a growing consensus on the importance of preoperative evaluation in these patients, with updated anesthesia protocols to reduce the risk of malignant hyperthermia episodes during surgery.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) can have familial forms which are associated with various genetic mutations. Among those, the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is recognized as the most common genetic abnormality in familial cases. The C9orf72 gene expansion results in the production of abnormal RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins, which are toxic to neurons. This leads to both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration, which is characteristic of ALS. Additionally, the presence of this mutation may predispose individuals to cognitive impairment and frontotemporal dementia. Clinically, ALS manifests with a mix of upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia) and lower motor neuron signs (atrophy, fasciculations). Patients with C9orf72 mutations may also exhibit cognitive and behavioral changes, implicating frontotemporal dysfunction. A positive family history and genetic testing help distinguish familial from sporadic cases. The workup for ALS involves electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies, and careful clinical evaluation to demonstrate both upper and lower motor neuron involvement. Genetic testing is important in familial cases to identify mutations such as the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Differential diagnoses include primary lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron disorders, which are differentiated by the extent of lower motor neuron involvement. Management of ALS is multidisciplinary. Riluzole is used as a first-line agent to modestly prolong survival, and edaravone may be considered in selected patients. Supportive care addressing respiratory, nutritional, and symptomatic issues is crucial. In pregnancy and lactation, drug safety becomes a concern; riluzole is categorized carefully due to limited data in pregnant and lactating women, and management typically requires a personalized risk-benefit analysis with a multidisciplinary team. Option A, C9orf72, is correct because it is the most common genetic mutation identified in familial ALS. Alternative genes (not provided as options) exist but are less commonly seen compared to C9orf72 in familial cases. 1) The hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the leading genetic cause of familial ALS. 2) Patients with this mutation may also present with cognitive or behavioral changes indicative of frontotemporal dysfunction. 3) Genetic counseling is recommended for affected families. Recent advances in genetic research have solidified the role of C9orf72 in familial ALS, and research is ongoing into targeted therapies that may one day address the underlying pathophysiology. Updated guidelines continue to emphasize the need for early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach to management.",

    "explanation": "This scenario points to a lesion that affects the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (C8\u2013T1), which supplies both motor and sensory fibers to parts of the hand. The sensory innervation of the medial (ulnar) aspect of the hand and forearm and the motor innervation to components of the intrinsic hand (including portions of the thenar eminence, via contributions from the median nerve) are derived from these roots. Injury or compression of the lower trunk (C8\u2013T1) \u2013 as seen in conditions like Klumpke palsy \u2013 damages both motor and sensory fibers. The resulting loss in sensory input on the medial aspect can occur from impaired ulnar and T1-mediated territories, while thenar muscle atrophy may reflect involvement of median nerve fibers that originate from the lower trunk. Traumatic traction injuries are a common underlying mechanism. Patients with lower trunk injuries often present with a combination of deficits. The decreased sensation in the medial hand and forearm, along with wasting of hand muscles (including part of the thenar eminence), aligns with dysfunction in the C8\u2013T1 distribution. Notably, while the classic ulnar nerve supplies the medial hand, the median nerve (especially its recurrent branch) also receives contributions from these roots, explaining the involvement of the thenar muscles. Differential diagnoses include isolated peripheral nerve lesions such as carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve compression) and ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. However, the simultaneous involvement of sensory and motor functions in territories served by different peripheral nerves suggests a higher-level brachial plexus involvement. Electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies, and imaging (e.g., MRI) of the brachial plexus are useful in localizing the lesion. Management depends on the cause and severity. First-line treatment in traumatic or compressive lesions involves physical therapy and splinting to preserve function. Surgical intervention (e.g., nerve repair or grafting) may be considered in cases with severe or persistent deficits. In patients who are pregnant or lactating, conservative management is preferable; if surgery is necessary, anesthetic and perioperative protocols are adjusted to minimize fetal/neonatal risk. Option A (C8\u2013T1) is correct because the sensory and motor deficits described imply involvement of the lower brachial plexus, which comprises the C8 and T1 nerve roots. The absence of other options does not detract from the fact that the clinical picture aligns best with a lower trunk lesion. 1. Lower trunk (Klumpke) injuries may present with mixed sensory deficits involving both ulnar and median nerve distributions. 2. Early identification and intervention (physical therapy/surgical repair) are crucial to optimize outcomes. Recent studies underscore the importance of early electrophysiological studies and high-resolution imaging in diagnosing brachial plexus injuries. Advances in microsurgical techniques and nerve transfers have improved outcomes in select patients.",

    "explanation": "POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disorder associated with an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. The acronym stands for Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and Skin changes. A hallmark of POEMS syndrome is the markedly elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level. VEGF overproduction leads to increased vascular permeability, contributing to edema, organomegaly, and other systemic manifestations that characterize the syndrome. Patients with POEMS commonly present with a demyelinating polyneuropathy along with other systemic features such as organ enlargement, endocrine dysfunction, and skin changes. The demonstration of an elevated VEGF level in serum helps distinguish POEMS from other causes of neuropathy. Clinical diagnosis of POEMS syndrome relies on identifying mandatory criteria (polyneuropathy and a monoclonal plasma cell disorder) along with several major and minor criteria. Differential diagnosis includes chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and other paraproteinemic neuropathies. Laboratory evaluation with serum VEGF levels, serum protein electrophoresis, and immunofixation, as well as nerve conduction studies, are critical. Treatment options vary with disease extent. For localized disease, radiation therapy targeting plasmacytomas is preferred. For systemic involvement, first-line therapies include corticosteroids in combination with immunomodulatory agents such as lenalidomide or thalidomide; autologous stem cell transplantation may be considered for eligible patients. In pregnant or lactating patients, management is particularly challenging \u2013 agents like thalidomide are contraindicated, and care must be taken with other systemic therapies, often favoring supportive measures until definitive therapy can be safely administered. Option C (VEGF) is correct. Options A (Anti-GM1) and B (Anti-MAG) are associated with other neuropathies \u2013 Anti-GM1 is more commonly seen in multifocal motor neuropathy, and Anti-MAG is linked to IgM-associated demyelinating neuropathies. 1. Elevated serum VEGF is a key diagnostic marker in POEMS syndrome. 2. The multisystem involvement in POEMS mandates a comprehensive evaluation beyond the peripheral neuropathy. Recent guidelines and clinical studies emphasize incorporating serum VEGF measurement into diagnostic criteria for POEMS syndrome. Ongoing research focuses on targeted therapies aimed at modulating VEGF levels and improving overall outcomes.",

    "explanation": "Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is recognized as the most common acquired myopathy in individuals over 50 years of age. It is an inflammatory myopathy with both degenerative and autoimmune features. IBM is characterized by endomysial inflammation, the presence of rimmed vacuoles, and deposition of misfolded proteins (including amyloid) within muscle fibers. This dual process of inflammatory and degenerative changes leads to progressive muscle fiber damage and weakness. Clinically, IBM presents with insidious onset and slowly progressive weakness. It often affects both proximal and distal muscles asymmetrically, particularly the quadriceps and finger flexors, leading to significant disability over time. The differential diagnosis includes polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Distinguishing features of IBM include resistance to immunosuppressive therapy and muscle biopsy findings (rimmed vacuoles, endomysial inflammation, and protein aggregates). Electromyography (EMG) and creatine kinase levels can support the diagnosis, but muscle biopsy is definitive. No consistently effective treatment exists for IBM. Management is predominantly supportive, involving physical therapy, occupational therapy, and assistive devices to maintain function. First-line treatment is conservative management as immunosuppressive agents (such as corticosteroids) have shown limited benefit. In the context of pregnancy or lactation, management remains supportive since aggressive immunosuppression is often avoided and must be balanced with fetal/neonatal safety. Option A (IBM) is correct. Other inflammatory myopathies, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis, are generally less common in this age group and typically present with different clinical and histopathological features. 1. IBM is the most common myopathy in patients over 50 years old. 2. It is characteristically refractory to conventional immunosuppressive treatments. Recent research continues to highlight the degenerative component of IBM, leading to clinical trials exploring novel therapeutic targets beyond traditional immunosuppression. There is also an increasing emphasis on rehabilitation and supportive care to optimize quality of life.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that is characterized by both muscle weakness and distinctive cutaneous findings. A key diagnostic feature on muscle biopsy is perifascicular atrophy. The pathology in dermatomyositis is believed to be mediated by a complement-driven microangiopathy. This leads to injury and subsequent ischemia at the edges of muscle fascicles, resulting in perifascicular atrophy along with perivascular and interfascicular inflammation. Patients typically present with symmetric proximal muscle weakness and characteristic skin rashes such as the heliotrope rash (around the eyes) or Gottron papules over the joints. The muscle biopsy finding of perifascicular atrophy correlates with the underlying vascular pathology seen in this condition. The differential diagnosis includes polymyositis and inclusion body myositis. However, the presence of distinctive skin changes, as well as muscle biopsy findings (perifascicular atrophy, perimysial inflammation), points to dermatomyositis. Other investigations include elevated muscle enzymes (e.g., creatine kinase) and autoantibody panels. First-line treatment typically consists of high-dose corticosteroids. Steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine may be added if needed. For pregnant or lactating patients, corticosteroids remain the mainstay as they are relatively safe when used judiciously, whereas agents like methotrexate are contraindicated. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is another option in refractory cases. Option A (Perifascicular atrophy) is the correct answer. This finding is a hallmark of dermatomyositis. Other options (if provided) would not align as precisely with the typical histopathological features of this disease. 1. Perifascicular atrophy on muscle biopsy is virtually pathognomonic for dermatomyositis. 2. Always look for concurrent skin findings when suspecting dermatomyositis. Recent guidelines continue to endorse corticosteroids as the first-line treatment. Newer studies are evaluating targeted immunotherapies and the role of biologic agents in treatment-refractory cases. There is also a focus on understanding the vascular component to better target microangiopathic changes.",

    "explanation": "Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is an acquired inflammatory myopathy that typically affects older adults. Its hallmark feature on muscle biopsy is the presence of rimmed vacuoles along with inflammatory infiltrates, which differentiates it from other inflammatory myopathies. IBM involves a combination of inflammatory and degenerative mechanisms. The muscle fibers exhibit abnormal protein accumulation and autophagic vacuoles that appear as rimmed vacuoles. Recent studies suggest that misfolded proteins (such as beta-amyloid and TDP-43) accumulate due to a defect in protein homeostasis, contributing to muscle fiber degeneration. Patients with IBM usually present with slowly progressive weakness, most notably affecting the quadriceps and finger flexors. The insidious onset and resistance to standard immunosuppressive treatments distinguish it from other myopathies. The rimmed vacuoles seen on biopsy correlate with the chronic degenerative changes in the muscle tissue. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical features, elevated serum creatine kinase (usually modestly raised), electromyography findings of mixed myopathic and neuropathic features, and, most definitively, muscle biopsy demonstrating rimmed vacuoles. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis and dermatomyositis, but these lack the typical rimmed vacuoles and often respond better to immunotherapy. Management is challenging as IBM tends to be resistant to immunosuppressive therapies. First-line management includes supportive measures such as physical therapy and occupational therapy to maintain function. There is ongoing research into targeted therapies addressing protein misfolding and autophagy. In pregnant or lactating patients, management remains supportive with an emphasis on safe physical therapy interventions since immunosuppressants are generally ineffective. Option A (Rimmed vacuoles) is correct because rimmed vacuoles are the classic histological marker for IBM. Other options (not listed) would not typically show this combination of inflammatory and degenerative changes seen in IBM. 1. IBM is typically resistant to steroids and immunosuppressants. 2. The presence of rimmed vacuoles on muscle biopsy is a key diagnostic clue. 3. IBM primarily affects older adults with slowly progressive muscle weakness. Recent research has focused on the role of protein misfolding and autophagy dysregulation in IBM, with emerging therapies targeting these pathways. Despite ongoing trials, current management remains largely supportive.",

    "question": "Which of the following muscles is innervated by the ulnar nerve?",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "The ulnar nerve supplies several muscles of the hand and forearm. One of the key muscles innervated by the ulnar nerve is the adductor pollicis, which is responsible for thumb adduction. The ulnar nerve originates from the medial cord of the brachial plexus (C8-T1) and provides motor innervation to muscles in the forearm (such as the flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of the flexor digitorum profundus) and most intrinsic hand muscles, including the adductor pollicis. Injury or dysfunction of the ulnar nerve can lead to impaired adduction of the thumb among other deficits. Ulnar nerve injury may lead to clinical signs such as weakness of thumb adduction (demonstrated by a positive Froment\u2019s sign), loss of fine motor skills, and sensory deficits in the ulnar aspect of the hand, which correlates with the involvement of the adductor pollicis. Evaluation includes a detailed neurological examination, nerve conduction studies, and electromyography to localize the lesion. Differential diagnoses include median nerve injury and radial nerve injury, which affect different muscle groups and sensory distributions. First-line management for ulnar neuropathy includes conservative treatments such as activity modification, splinting, and physical therapy. If conservative measures fail, surgical decompression or nerve transfer may be indicated. In pregnant or lactating patients, conservative management is preferred to avoid surgical risks and medication side effects. Option A (Adductor pollicis) is correct because this muscle is exclusively innervated by the ulnar nerve. Other muscles (if provided) may be innervated by different nerves (e.g., median or radial) or have dual innervation. 1. A positive Froment\u2019s sign is a clinical pointer to ulnar nerve dysfunction. 2. The adductor pollicis is a key muscle to evaluate when assessing ulnar nerve integrity. 3. Accurate localization of nerve injury via EMG can differentiate it from other neuropathies. Recent guidelines emphasize early electrophysiological studies in cases of suspected ulnar neuropathy to guide management. Conservative treatment remains the mainstay, with surgical interventions reserved for refractory cases.",

    "question": "Case about young male with Kearns Sayre syndrome, had weakness and progressive ophthalmoparesis, with no family history and they asked about the diagnosis",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a mitochondrial cytopathy that generally presents before the age of 20 with a triad of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and cardiac conduction defects. It is typically sporadic in nature due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. KSS is caused by large-scale deletions in mtDNA, leading to impaired mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are responsible for energy production, and tissues with high energy demands (such as ocular muscles, the retina, and the heart) are preferentially affected, resulting in the multi-systemic features seen in KSS. Patients present with symptoms including progressive weakness, ophthalmoparesis (difficulty with eye movements), ptosis, and sometimes additional systemic manifestations such as cerebellar ataxia or endocrine abnormalities. The absence of a clear family history is consistent with the sporadic nature of mtDNA deletions. Diagnosis is confirmed through a combination of clinical evaluation, electrocardiography (to detect conduction defects), ophthalmologic examination (to identify pigmentary retinopathy), and muscle biopsy, which typically reveals ragged-red fibers. Genetic testing for mtDNA deletions is definitive. Differential diagnoses, such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, are differentiated by age of onset, pattern of muscle involvement, and genetic findings. Management is mainly supportive. Regular cardiac monitoring is recommended, and pacemaker insertion may be necessary if conduction abnormalities are severe. Coenzyme Q10 and other metabolic supplements are sometimes used though with variable benefit. In pregnant or lactating patients, careful cardiac and metabolic monitoring is important, and genetic counseling is advised due to the risk of mitochondrial transmission. Option A (Kearns-Sayre syndrome) is correct, as the clinical presentation of progressive ophthalmoparesis combined with systemic features and the absence of a family history aligns with KSS. Option B (Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy) typically presents later in life with ptosis and dysphagia and follows an autosomal dominant pattern, making it less likely in this scenario. 1. KSS should be suspected in young patients with external ophthalmoplegia and multi-system involvement. 2. Cardiac conduction defects in KSS may necessitate early pacemaker placement. 3. Muscle biopsy demonstrating ragged-red fibers is a key diagnostic clue. Recent advances in genetic testing have improved the accuracy of diagnosing mitochondrial disorders like KSS. Current research is exploring potential metabolic therapies, although management remains largely supportive.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy that primarily affects the facial muscles and the shoulder girdle, often progressing to involve the upper arms and, in some cases, the lower extremities. FSHD is associated with a contraction of the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q35, leading to the aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene, which is toxic to muscle cells. This genetic change results in progressive muscle fiber degeneration, predominantly in the facial and scapular muscle groups, with possible extension to limb muscles over time. Patients typically present with facial weakness (manifested as difficulty with tasks such as whistling, blowing air, or smiling), scapular winging due to involvement of periscapular muscles, and progressive weakness in the upper limbs. Lower extremity involvement, such as foot drop, can occur in later or sometimes asymmetric presentations of the disease. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by genetic testing for D4Z4 repeat contraction. Differential diagnoses include myotonic dystrophy (which features myotonia and systemic findings) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (typically sparing the face). Muscle biopsy is less commonly needed but may show nonspecific dystrophic changes. There is no cure for FSHD; management is supportive and includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and the use of orthotic devices to aid mobility (for instance, ankle-foot orthoses in the case of foot drop). Pain management and surgical interventions (e.g., scapular fixation) may be considered in selected cases. In pregnant or lactating patients, management remains supportive, and genetic counseling is recommended to discuss inheritance patterns and potential risks to offspring. Option A (FSHD) is correct as it best fits the clinical scenario: facial weakness (difficulty blowing air), weakness involving the arm (both flexors and extensors), scapular winging, and lower extremity involvement (foot drop). Other muscular dystrophies tend to have different patterns of muscle involvement. For example, limb-girdle muscular dystrophies usually spare the face, and myotonic dystrophy is characterized by myotonia and systemic features not mentioned in this case. 1. FSHD typically presents with asymmetric facial weakness and scapular winging. 2. Even though it predominantly involves the face and shoulder girdle, lower limb involvement such as foot drop may occur. 3. Genetic testing for D4Z4 contraction confirms the diagnosis. Recent studies have focused on targeting the DUX4 gene expression as a potential therapeutic strategy for FSHD. While no disease-modifying treatments are currently approved, advances in gene therapy and clinical trials offer hope for future treatments. Current management guidelines emphasize supportive care and early multidisciplinary intervention.",
