    "explanation": "Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B gene. This mutation leads to impaired hepatic copper excretion and accumulation of copper in tissues, particularly the liver, brain, and cornea. The clinical hallmark is the presence of Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings seen on slit lamp examination along with neurological signs, such as parkinsonism and dystonia. The ATP7B gene mutation disrupts normal copper transport in hepatocytes causing copper to accumulate. Excess copper leads to hepatocellular damage and eventually spills over into the bloodstream, depositing in the brain (especially in the basal ganglia), cornea, and other organs. This accumulation results in neurological manifestations (e.g., movement disorders) and characteristic ocular findings. In a young female presenting with movement disorders like parkinsonism and dystonia along with a Kayser\u2013Fleischer ring, Wilson disease is highly suspected. Early identification and treatment are crucial to prevent irreversible organ damage. The diagnosis of Wilson disease involves a combination of clinical examination (notably slit lamp exam for Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings), biochemical tests (reduced serum ceruloplasmin, increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion), liver function tests, and sometimes liver biopsy and genetic testing. Differential diagnoses include other movement disorders; however, the presence of a Kayser\u2013Fleischer ring is pathognomonic for copper accumulation. The cornerstone of Wilson disease treatment is copper chelation. D-Penicillamine is the first-line agent that binds copper, facilitating its excretion. While alternative agents such as trientine and zinc (which blocks copper absorption in the gut) exist, D-Penicillamine remains widely used. Management in pregnant or lactating patients requires careful dose adjustment and close monitoring due to potential side effects; however, the benefits of chelation to prevent disease progression generally outweigh the risks when managed appropriately. Option A (D-Penicillamine) is the established first-line therapy for Wilson disease, directly addressing the underlying copper overload. Option B (Trihexyphenidyl) is an anticholinergic agent that may provide symptomatic relief, particularly for dystonia, but does not treat the primary problem of copper accumulation. Although options C and D are unspecified, they might represent other chelation strategies (such as trientine or zinc therapy). Nonetheless, D-Penicillamine is the most widely recognized treatment in this context. Early detection and treatment of Wilson disease can stabilize or reverse neurological damage. Regular monitoring for adverse effects of D-Penicillamine (e.g., hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression) is essential. In women of childbearing age, managing therapy during pregnancy and lactation is critical, and any treatment plan must balance effective copper chelation with safety for both mother and child. Latest guidelines and research continue to support the use of D-Penicillamine as first-line therapy for Wilson disease despite its potential adverse effects, provided patients are carefully monitored. Recent studies also emphasize the importance of early intervention and individualized treatment approaches, including special considerations during pregnancy and lactation, where dosing adjustments may be required to minimize fetal and neonatal risks.",

    "question": "Patient with recurrent unilateral eye twitching and sometimes mouth twitching, she has no history of facial (Bells) palsy, what is the treatment?",
    "option_a": "Botox injections",
    "option_b": "Carbamazepine",
    "option_c": "?",
    "option_d": "?",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "The patient\u2019s presentation of recurrent unilateral eye twitching with occasional mouth involvement, in the absence of a history of Bell\u2019s palsy, strongly suggests a diagnosis of hemifacial spasm. Hemifacial spasm is a disorder characterized by involuntary, intermittent contractions of the muscles innervated by the facial nerve on one side of the face. Hemifacial spasm is most frequently attributed to vascular compression of the facial nerve at the root exit zone of the brainstem. This compression leads to hyperexcitability and ephaptic transmission, resulting in involuntary muscle contractions. The absence of a previous facial nerve injury further supports this mechanism rather than a sequela of Bell\u2019s palsy. Clinically, hemifacial spasm typically begins with twitching of the orbicularis oculi and can spread to involve the lower facial muscles. The unilateral nature of the spasm, along with the lack of associated facial weakness (as seen in Bell\u2019s palsy), helps differentiate this condition from other facial movement disorders. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. A careful history and neurological examination are essential. Imaging studies, such as MRI, may be utilized to exclude structural causes like tumors or demyelinating lesions. Differential diagnoses include benign essential blepharospasm (often bilateral), trigeminal neuralgia (painful paroxysms), and other forms of focal dystonia. The first-line treatment for hemifacial spasm is botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, which act by temporarily reducing muscle hyperactivity. This treatment is evidence-based and widely accepted as the standard of care. In patients who are pregnant or lactating, caution is advised; botulinum toxin is generally reserved for cases where the benefits outweigh the potential risks, as safety data in pregnancy is limited. Alternative surgical approaches, such as microvascular decompression, may be considered in refractory cases but carry greater risk and are typically not first-line. Option A (Botox injections) is the appropriate and evidence-supported treatment for hemifacial spasm. Option B (Carbamazepine) is used for conditions like trigeminal neuralgia and is not indicated for hemifacial spasm. The absence of details for Options C and D does not detract from the validity of using botulinum toxin injections as the best treatment option in this clinical scenario. Recognize that unilateral facial twitching without a background history of facial nerve paralysis is most consistent with hemifacial spasm. Botulinum toxin injections provide effective symptomatic relief and improve patient quality of life. Consideration of pregnancy and lactation is essential, as treatment may need to be modified based on the risk-benefit profile. Recent clinical studies and guidelines continue to endorse botulinum toxin injections as the first-line therapy for hemifacial spasm. This therapeutic approach remains supported by robust evidence demonstrating significant reduction in spasm frequency and improvement in patient outcomes.",

    "question": "Elderly patient with gait imbalance and urinary urgency progressed to incontinence, has bilateral mild rigidity with no tremor, what is the likely findings an MRI brain?",
    "option_a": "Hot cross bun sign",
    "option_b": "Hummingbird sign",
    "option_c": "Brain atrophy",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "The case describes an elderly patient with gait imbalance, urinary urgency progressing to incontinence, and bilateral mild rigidity without tremor. This constellation of features is highly suggestive of an atypical parkinsonian syndrome, particularly Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). One of the supportive radiologic features of MSA is the hot cross bun sign, which is seen on axial T2\u2010weighted MRI images as a cruciform hyperintensity in the pons. MSA is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of alpha\u2010synuclein within oligodendrocytes, leading to glial cytoplasmic inclusions. The neurodegeneration affects the striatonigral, olivopontocerebellar, and autonomic systems. When the cerebellar system is involved (MSA-C), degeneration of the pontocerebellar fibers results in the hot cross bun sign. Even in a predominantly parkinsonian presentation (MSA-P), overlapping features with cerebellar involvement may yield similar findings. Patients with MSA typically present in their 50s to 60s with a mixture of parkinsonian features (rigidity, bradykinesia) that are often poorly responsive to levodopa, and early autonomic dysfunction (urinary incontinence, orthostatic hypotension). The absence of a prominent tremor differentiates MSA from idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. Although the clinical triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment is classic for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), the presence of parkinsonism without tremor and the specific MRI finding support MSA in this scenario. Key differentials include: 1) Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), which would typically show disproportionately enlarged ventricles (ventriculomegaly) rather than a specific sign like the hot cross bun; 2) Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), which is associated with midbrain atrophy giving a hummingbird sign; and 3) Idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, which usually presents with a resting tremor. Correlating clinical findings with neuroimaging is essential to distinguish among these conditions. There is no curative treatment for MSA; management focuses on symptomatic and supportive care. Parkinsonism may be attempted to be managed with low-dose levodopa, though the response is generally limited. Autonomic dysfunction (e.g., urinary incontinence) is addressed through behavioral modifications, bladder training, and pharmacologic measures when appropriate. In cases where patients are or might become pregnant or are lactating (a rare scenario in MSA given the typical age of onset), careful review of medication safety is essential and management should be coordinated with obstetric specialists per current guidelines. Option A (Hot cross bun sign) is the correct answer, as it is a supportive MRI finding seen in MSA due to pontocerebellar fiber degeneration. Option B (Hummingbird sign) is typically associated with PSP, and Option C (Brain atrophy) is a non-specific finding and does not represent the characteristic imaging of either NPH or MSA. \u2022 Early autonomic dysfunction (e.g., urinary incontinence) combined with a parkinsonian presentation lacking the typical tremor of idiopathic Parkinson's disease should prompt consideration of MSA.  \u2022 MRI findings such as the hot cross bun sign enhance diagnostic confidence in MSA, although clinical correlation is paramount. Recent research and consensus guidelines emphasize that while neuroimaging (including the identification of the hot cross bun sign) is supportive in diagnosing MSA, the diagnosis primarily relies on clinical criteria. Early and accurate differentiation from other parkinsonian syndromes is crucial for management, even as treatment remains primarily supportive.",

    "question": "Child presented with dystonia and Parkinsonism, brain MRI reported as bilateral hyperintensity in the basal ganglia (The description of eye of tiger was not typical)",
    "option_a": "Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration",
    "option_b": "?",
    "option_c": "?",
    "option_d": "?",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is one of the primary disorders within the group of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). It is classically characterized by early-onset movement disorders such as dystonia and parkinsonism in children. The archetypal neuroradiologic finding is the 'eye-of-tiger' sign on T2-weighted MRI, which represents central hyperintensity with a surrounding rim of hypointensity in the globus pallidus. PKAN is caused by mutations in the PANK2 gene, which disrupts the synthesis of coenzyme A. This defect leads to abnormal iron handling and deposition within the basal ganglia. Excess iron may promote oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, causing neuronal injury. Although the classic 'eye-of-tiger' sign is pathognomonic, variations or atypical imaging findings can occur, yet the clinical picture of dystonia and parkinsonism in a child strongly points to PKAN. Children with PKAN often present with progressive dystonia, rigidity, and parkinsonian features along with other signs such as dysarthria and spasticity. The MRI finding of bilateral hyperintensity in the basal ganglia, even if not classically described as the 'eye-of-tiger', should raise suspicion especially when the clinical manifestations are consistent. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, characteristic neuroimaging findings, and confirmed by genetic testing for PANK2 mutations. Differential diagnoses include other NBIA disorders (e.g., PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration) and metabolic disorders like Wilson\u2019s disease. The latter typically involves other features (e.g., hepatic dysfunction, Kayser-Fleischer rings) and has distinct laboratory markers. Management is predominantly supportive and symptomatic. First-line therapies include medications for dystonia (e.g., anticholinergics like trihexyphenidyl, muscle relaxants such as baclofen) and parkinsonism. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be considered in refractory cases. There is no definitive cure. In pregnancy and lactation, symptomatic medications should be carefully evaluated for teratogenic risk; for example, if using anticholinergics, caution and close monitoring are warranted with consideration for the risks versus benefits. Option A (Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration) is correct because it best fits the clinical scenario of childhood dystonia and parkinsonism with basal ganglia involvement, even if the MRI description is not classic. The other options, though not provided, would likely represent different or unrelated neurodegenerative conditions. 1. The 'eye-of-tiger' sign is highly suggestive but may not appear in all cases. 2. PKAN is the most common NBIA disorder and should be considered in children with early-onset movement disorders. 3. Confirmatory genetic testing for PANK2 mutation is key. Recent advances in neuroimaging and genetic testing have helped refine the diagnosis of PKAN. Research is ongoing regarding iron chelation therapies and neuroprotective strategies, although none have yet replaced symptomatic management as the standard of care.",

    "question": "Young female has recurrent muscle (or neck) spasm triggered by sudden neck movement, what is the treatment?",
    "option_a": "Carbamazepine",
    "option_b": "?",
    "option_c": "?",
    "option_d": "?",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "The scenario describes a young female with recurrent muscle or neck spasms triggered by sudden neck movement, which is characteristic of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD). PKD is a movement disorder where brief episodes of involuntary movements, usually dystonic in nature, occur in response to sudden movements. Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant with sodium channel blocking properties, is considered the first-line treatment. PKD is believed to result from a channelopathy, where transient paroxysms of abnormal neuronal firing lead to involuntary movements. The exact genetic and molecular bases are still under investigation, but sodium channel dysfunction is suspected. Carbamazepine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting sodium channels, thus reducing the abnormal paroxysmal discharges. Clinically, patients with PKD experience brief episodes of dystonia or chorea triggered by sudden movements (e.g., turning the neck). The attacks are typically short-lived and can be highly disabling despite their transient nature. Diagnosis is based primarily on clinical history and the demonstration of reliable triggers. Differential diagnoses include other forms of paroxysmal dyskinesias (such as paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia) and epileptic disorders. Normal neurological examinations between attacks help differentiate PKD from other seizure disorders. EEG studies are typically normal during attacks in PKD. First-line management for PKD is with carbamazepine due to its efficacy in reducing attacks. If carbamazepine is contraindicated or not tolerated, alternative antiepileptic drugs (such as phenytoin) may be considered. In pregnant or lactating women, carbamazepine use requires careful consideration due to teratogenic risks (e.g., neural tube defects); folic acid supplementation is recommended and a risk-benefit discussion is essential. Option A (Carbamazepine) is correct because it directly addresses the paroxysmal nature of the movement disorder by reducing neuronal excitability. The other options (though not provided) would likely involve treatments not proven effective for PKD. 1. PKD episodes are typically very brief but can be highly distressing for patients. 2. Carbamazepine is effective in controlling paroxysmal events, making it the treatment of choice. 3. Always consider the pregnancy status and supplement folic acid when using antiepileptics in women of childbearing age. Recent studies continue to support the use of carbamazepine as the first-line treatment for PKD. Ongoing research into the genetic basis of PKD may eventually refine diagnostic criteria and lead to novel therapeutic targets.",

    "question": "Patient with idiopathic Parkinson disease, complaining of hallucination, has mild rigidity and bradykinesia and minimal dyskinesia, what medication should be discontinued?",
    "option_a": "Pramipexole",
    "option_b": "Amantadine",
    "option_c": "Trihexyphenidyl",
    "option_d": "? (?Levodopa)",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "In patients with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), non-motor symptoms such as hallucinations can be a side effect of dopaminergic therapy. Dopamine agonists like pramipexole are particularly implicated because their stimulation of dopamine receptors, especially in the mesolimbic pathway, may lead to psychosis or hallucinations. Hallucinations in PD are thought to result from an imbalance between dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission. Dopamine agonists, while improving motor symptoms by stimulating dopamine receptors, can overstimulate mesolimbic circuits, which are associated with psychosis. The vulnerability to these side effects increases with dose and duration of therapy. The patient presents with idiopathic PD, experiencing hallucinations in the context of mild rigidity and bradykinesia and minimal dyskinesia. This clinical picture suggests that the psychosis is likely medication-induced rather than a sign of disease progression such as dementia with Lewy bodies. A careful medication history is critical. Differential diagnoses include Lewy body dementia (which also features visual hallucinations) and other causes of psychosis. However, the temporal association with the initiation or dose adjustment of medications\u2014especially dopamine agonists\u2014points towards a drug-induced etiology. The first step in managing hallucinations in PD is to reassess and streamline the dopaminergic regimen. The recommended approach is to reduce or discontinue the medication most likely responsible\u2014in this case, pramipexole. Second-line options, if psychosis persists, may include the cautious use of atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine or quetiapine, which have a lower risk of worsening motor symptoms. During pregnancy or lactation, the use of any antipsychotic should be carefully balanced against the risks of untreated psychosis, with close monitoring and specialist consultation. Option A (Pramipexole) is correct because dopamine agonists are well-documented to induce hallucinations in PD patients, particularly when motor symptoms are otherwise well-controlled. Option B (Amantadine) is less commonly associated with hallucinations and is often used to control dyskinesia. Option C (Trihexyphenidyl) is an anticholinergic, which although can cause confusion (especially in the elderly), is not the primary agent implicated in this scenario when the patient's motor symptoms are minimal. 1. Dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole, are a frequent cause of hallucinations in PD patients. 2. A stepwise reduction of the offending agent is the recommended first-line approach. 3. When modifying PD treatment, aim to control both motor and non-motor symptoms while minimizing adverse effects. Recent guidelines emphasize the importance of reducing dopaminergic load in PD patients presenting with hallucinations. Studies support that lowering or discontinuing dopamine agonists can significantly improve psychotic symptoms while maintaining motor control, with individualized adjustments based on patient tolerance and disease severity.",

    "question": "Young patient with lip bite and face and limb dystonia, blood smear showed abnormal RBC with thorny projections, what is the diagnosis?",

    "option_c": "?",
    "option_d": "?",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Neuroacanthocytosis refers to a group of rare neurodegenerative disorders characterized by movement abnormalities (such as dystonia, chorea, and orofacial dyskinesias) and the presence of acanthocytes (spiky red blood cells) on a peripheral blood smear. The presence of lip biting, facial dystonia, and limb involvement is highly suggestive of these conditions. In neuroacanthocytosis, genetic mutations (for instance, in the VPS13A gene in chorea-acanthocytosis) lead to abnormal protein functions that affect both neuronal pathways and red blood cell membrane stability. This dual pathology results in the typical neurological manifestations alongside morphological abnormalities of the RBCs (acanthocytosis). Patients often present at a young age with involuntary movements and dystonic posturing, which can lead to self-injurious behaviors such as lip biting. The blood smear findings of thorny red blood cells (acanthocytes) provide an important laboratory clue that links the neurological and hematological aspects of the disease. Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation, the finding of acanthocytes on a blood smear, and confirmatory genetic testing. Differential diagnoses include other movement disorders such as Huntington\u2019s disease, Wilson\u2019s disease, or atypical Parkinsonism; however, these conditions do not present with acanthocytosis. A detailed family history and neurologic assessment also aid in narrowing the diagnosis. There is no cure for neuroacanthocytosis; management is primarily supportive and symptomatic. Treatments may include the use of tetrabenazine or anticholinergics to manage movement disorders, and botulinum toxin injections for focal dystonia. Multidisciplinary care involving neurology, psychiatry, and physical therapy is essential. In pregnancy, careful management of medications is required given potential teratogenic risks, and decisions should be individualized with a focus on minimizing fetal exposure while controlling maternal symptoms. Option A (Neuroacanthocytosis) is correct because the combination of movement disorder (with face and limb dystonia and self-mutilation behavior like lip biting) and the blood smear finding of acanthocytes (thorny projections) is characteristic of this condition. Other options, although not specified, would likely refer to different movement disorders that do not exhibit acanthocytosis. 1. Acanthocytosis on a peripheral smear in a young patient with dystonia is a key diagnostic clue for neuroacanthocytosis. 2. Self-mutilating behaviors (e.g., lip biting) are classic in chorea-acanthocytosis. 3. Genetic testing plays a crucial role in confirming the diagnosis. Recent advances in genetic sequencing have improved the diagnostic accuracy for neuroacanthocytosis syndromes. Ongoing research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved, which may eventually lead to targeted therapies. Current management remains supportive, emphasizing the importance of a multidisciplinary approach.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder marked by uncomfortable leg sensations and an irresistible urge to move, often worsening at rest and in the evening. In pregnancy, RLS is relatively common because of increased iron demands and altered iron metabolism. Iron is crucial for dopamine synthesis and function in the central nervous system. In RLS, particularly in pregnant women, even in the absence of overt anemia, a relative iron deficiency may disrupt dopaminergic pathways, precipitating the symptoms. The condition can be either primary (idiopathic) or secondary, with pregnancy being a well-known secondary cause. Patients typically report an uncomfortable tingling or crawling sensation in the legs that improves with movement (e.g., rubbing the legs, walking). In pregnancy, these symptoms may interfere with sleep and overall quality of life, even if standard hemoglobin levels are within normal range. The diagnosis of RLS is largely clinical. Key differentials include peripheral neuropathy, leg cramps, and venous insufficiency. Laboratory evaluation should include assessing serum ferritin levels because iron deficiency (even without anemia) is frequently implicated in RLS pathogenesis during pregnancy. For pregnant patients, first-line management of RLS involves non-pharmacologic measures (e.g., sleep hygiene, stretching exercises). If symptoms are significant and iron deficiency is suspected, iron supplementation (e.g., ferrous sulfate) is recommended even in the absence of diagnostic anemia. Pharmacologic agents like dopamine agonists (pramipexole) or gabapentinoids are generally avoided due to potential fetal risks, and benzodiazepines (like clonazepam) are not the preferred option given their sedation and teratogenic profile. In lactation, iron supplementation remains safe. Option A (Pramipexole): A dopamine agonist that is generally contraindicated or used with caution in pregnancy due to limited safety data. Option B (Clonazepam): Although sometimes used for RLS, its potential risks in pregnancy (e.g., sedation, possible fetal harm) make it less favorable. Option C (Ferrous sulfate): Correct choice, as iron supplementation is the first-line and safest approach in a pregnant patient, addressing possible underlying iron deficiency. Option D (Gabapentin): While occasionally used in RLS, it is not first-line, especially in pregnancy where safety data is less robust. 1) Pregnant women with RLS should be evaluated for iron deficiency even if they are not overtly anemic. 2) Movement provides temporary relief\u2014a hallmark feature of RLS. 3) Iron supplementation (ferrous sulfate) is both safe and indicated in pregnancy when RLS is suspected to be related to iron deficiency. Recent guidelines and studies emphasize checking serum ferritin levels in pregnant women with RLS symptoms and initiating iron supplementation if levels are low. Non-pharmacologic management remains the cornerstone, and current research continues to explore safe pharmacologic alternatives in pregnancy.",

    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Sydenham chorea is a neurologic manifestation of rheumatic fever that typically occurs in children following an infection with group A streptococcus. The condition is believed to result from an autoimmune cross-reactivity where antibodies generated against streptococcal antigens mistakenly attack the basal ganglia, leading to inflammation and resulting in choreiform movements. Children present with rapid, involuntary, dance-like movements (chorea), emotional lability, and hypotonia. This onset is usually delayed by several weeks following a streptococcal pharyngitis or a similar infection. Diagnosis is clinical and supported by laboratory evidence of a recent streptococcal infection. Measurement of the antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer is commonly used to confirm this, along with other markers like anti-DNase B antibodies. Differential diagnoses include other causes of chorea, such as Wilson's disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, or drug-induced conditions. Management is largely supportive and includes symptomatic treatment for chorea if needed, along with long-term antibiotic prophylaxis (typically benzathine penicillin) to prevent recurrent group A streptococcal infections. In children, these antibiotics are considered safe. In pregnant or lactating patients (though rare in this age group), agents like penicillin remain the treatment of choice. Option A (ASO titer): Correct, as it helps confirm a recent streptococcal infection, supporting the diagnosis of Sydenham chorea. Other options were either not specified or not the appropriate first-line diagnostic test. 1) Sydenham chorea usually appears several weeks after a streptococcal infection. 2) It is a key indicator of rheumatic fever and warrants evaluation for carditis. 3) Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is critical to prevent recurrence. Latest guidelines reiterate the importance of laboratory confirmation of a prior streptococcal infection (using ASO titer and anti-DNase B) in patients suspected of having Sydenham chorea, with prophylactic antibiotic use to avert future rheumatic fever episodes.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson\u2019s disease is managed by optimizing dopaminergic therapy to control motor symptoms such as bradykinesia and rigidity. Over time, patients may experience motor fluctuations, including a wearing-off effect as medication levels fall before the next dose. The disease involves progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. With chronic levodopa use, the duration of dopamine receptor stimulation may become inconsistent, leading to re-emergence of motor symptoms before the next scheduled dose. Patients reporting increased bradykinesia, stiffness, or pain in the period leading up to their next dose are exhibiting a classic wearing-off phenomenon of Parkinson's disease. Evaluation involves a detailed patient history and symptom diary to differentiate wearing-off from other issues like medication non-adherence or disease progression. Differential diagnoses include dyskinesia (which typically follows peak dosing) and other non-motor fluctuations. First-line management involves more frequent dosing of levodopa to provide steadier plasma levels and reduce the intermittent declines that cause symptoms. Increasing the dosing frequency from four to five times daily is a typical strategy. Additional approaches may include the addition of COMT inhibitors (e.g., entacapone) or MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline) if needed. In pregnancy, although Parkinson\u2019s disease is uncommon, levodopa is considered relatively safe when benefits outweigh risks and should be managed in consultation with a specialist. Option A (Increase frequency to 5 times per day): Correct, since fractionating the levodopa doses helps reduce wearing-off. Option B (Start Amantadine): More relevant for treating levodopa-induced dyskinesias rather than wearing-off. Option C (Start selegiline): An MAO-B inhibitor can be added but is not the initial strategy when adjusting dosing frequency is effective. Option D (Switch to pramipexole): Dopamine agonists may be used in early Parkinson\u2019s but are not typically the first step in managing wearing-off in a patient already on levodopa. 1) Wearing-off phenomena are common in long-term levodopa therapy. 2) Adjusting the dosing schedule is a primary strategy to minimize motor fluctuations. 3) Always document symptom patterns with a diary to guide management adjustments. Current clinical guidelines recommend a tailored approach to managing wearing-off in Parkinson\u2019s disease, beginning with dosing adjustments. Recent studies support the use of adjunct therapies for patients who do not respond adequately to increased dosing frequency.",

This is in contrast to disorders such as MSA and DLB, which are classified as synucleinopathies due to the accumulation of alpha-synuclein. PSP typically presents with early falls, postural instability, vertical gaze palsy, and parkinsonian symptoms that are poorly responsive to levodopa. These features help distinguish PSP from other parkinsonian syndromes. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by neuroimaging findings (for example, the 'hummingbird sign' seen on midbrain MRI). Differential diagnoses include other parkinsonian disorders such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which are differentiated based on clinical features and imaging markers. Management of PSP is supportive. There are no currently approved disease-modifying therapies. Treatment focuses on symptom management with pharmacologic agents to address rigidity and akinesia and non-pharmacologic measures such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy. These interventions are similarly applicable in special populations including pregnant or lactating patients, where the emphasis remains on supportive care. Option A (MSA): Incorrect, as MSA is a synucleinopathy. Option B (PSP): Correct, as PSP is the classic tauopathy. Option C (DLB): Incorrect, since DLB is also a synucleinopathy. Option D is not provided. 1) PSP is characterized by early postural instability and vertical gaze palsy. 2) It is a classic example of tauopathy, distinct from synucleinopathies. 3) Management is symptomatic and supportive as no disease-modifying treatment is available. Recent research on tau protein pathology continues to explore potential targeted therapies for tauopathies such as PSP, though current management remains focused on supportive care. Latest guidelines emphasize accurate clinical diagnosis, as differentiating PSP from other parkinsonian syndromes is crucial for prognosis and management.",

    "question": "Parkinson patient on levodopa carbidopa 25/250 Q4 and selegiline for 7 years started to have rigidity and wearing off symptoms for two and half hours. How to manage the peak dose dyskinesia best ttt.",

    "option_d": "is blank and thus not contributory.",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a dopamine deficiency. Long-term use of levodopa, the mainstay treatment for PD, frequently results in motor complications such as wearing off phenomena and peak\u2010dose dyskinesia. Amantadine, originally an anti\u2010influenza drug, has been found to have antidyskinetic properties. Peak-dose dyskinesias are thought to result from non-physiological, pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors which leads to maladaptive plastic changes and enhanced glutamatergic activity in the basal ganglia circuitry. Amantadine acts by antagonizing NMDA receptors, thereby reducing excitatory glutamatergic transmission that contributes to the dyskinetic movements. Patients with long-standing PD on levodopa often develop motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. In this case, the patient exhibits rigidity and wearing-off symptoms with subsequent peak dyskinesias during the levodopa peak effect. Recognizing the timing of dyskinesia relative to medication dosing helps in differentiating peak-dose dyskinesia from other motor complications. The diagnosis is clinical, based on the patient\u2019s history and the correlation between levodopa dosing and the appearance of dyskinetic movements. Differential diagnoses include diphasic dyskinesia (associated with the beginning and end of the dose cycle) and off-period dystonia. A careful review of the medication regimen and a detailed movement examination are essential. First-line treatment for peak-dose dyskinesia is the addition of amantadine. Other strategies include altering the levodopa regimen by decreasing the individual dose while increasing frequency to maintain motor control (although this may not exclusively address the dyskinesia and may worsen rigidity). In pregnancy and lactation, treatment must be individualized; while amantadine is not first-line in pregnant patients due to limited safety data, the risk-benefit profile must be carefully reviewed. Alternate regimens might be considered if the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding. Option A (Amantadine): Correct, because it directly targets the pathophysiological mechanism (NMDA receptor antagonism) implicated in peak-dose dyskinesia. Option B (Agonist pramipexol): A dopamine agonist may improve motor symptoms but is not known to alleviate peak-dose dyskinesia and may contribute to dyskinetic phenomena. Option C (Decrease levodopa dose and increase frequency): While this strategy is used to smooth out peaks and troughs, it can be less effective in controlling established peak-dose dyskinesia and may lead to worsening of other parkinsonian symptoms. Option D is blank and thus not contributory. 1. Long-term levodopa therapy commonly leads to peak-dose dyskinesia. 2. Amantadine remains the most effective pharmacologic treatment for peak-dose dyskinesia due to its NMDA receptor antagonism. 3. Adjusting levodopa dosing may help in some cases but must be balanced against the risk of worsening motor symptoms. Recent studies and treatment guidelines support the use of amantadine (including extended-release formulations) for managing levodopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesia. Ongoing research continues to refine dosing strategies and assess long-term safety, with emerging data emphasizing the role of glutamatergic modulation in managing dyskinesia.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Orthostatic tremor (OT) is a rare movement disorder characterized by rapid, high-frequency (usually 13-18 Hz) tremors that occur in the legs when standing. It is distinct from other tremor disorders due to its unique presentation and frequency. The exact mechanism of OT remains unclear, though it is thought to involve aberrant central oscillatory activity within the cerebellothalamocortical pathways. Unlike other forms of tremor, OT is uniquely triggered by the sustained postural load of standing. Clinically, patients present with a sensation of unsteadiness or trembling in the legs when standing still, which typically improves markedly with walking or sitting down. This improvement upon movement is a hallmark of orthostatic tremor. The diagnosis is mainly clinical. Electrophysiological studies such as surface electromyography (EMG) can confirm the diagnosis by detecting the characteristic high-frequency tremor. Differential diagnoses include essential tremor, which is typically postural and kinetic, and other forms of tremor with lower frequencies. First-line treatment options may include medications such as clonazepam or gabapentin to alleviate symptoms, although response rates vary. In pregnant or lactating women, treatment must be approached cautiously, with risk-benefit considerations given the limited safety data for these agents during pregnancy. Non-pharmacological interventions such as using supportive devices may also be valuable. Option A (Improve with walking): Correct, because the tremor characteristic of OT typically diminishes or disappears with movement, such as walking, as the postural load is relieved. Other options were not provided but would likely have addressed alternative characteristics which do not align with OT. 1. OT is uniquely characterized by a rapid tremor that is only present during standing and promptly improves with movement. 2. A surface EMG is the key diagnostic tool. 3. Recognizing the condition is essential to alleviate patient anxiety, as the tremor may be misconstrued as a sign of impending instability or neurologic decline. Recent literature underlines the rarity of OT and supports the use of electrophysiological studies for diagnosis. There are ongoing studies evaluating the efficacy of different pharmacologic agents, but treatment remains largely symptomatic as robust, large-scale trials are lacking.",

    "option_c": "It is palate myoclonus and it may continue in sleep",
    "option_d": "Not movement disorder and will disappear in sleep",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Palatal myoclonus refers to involuntary, rhythmic contractions of the muscles of the soft palate. It is typically associated with an audible clicking or buzzing sound, often described as an ear sound, which can be distressing to patients. The underlying mechanism of palatal myoclonus involves lesions within the dentato\u2013rubro\u2013olivary pathway (collectively known as the Guillain-Mollaret triangle). These lesions lead to abnormal oscillatory activity. Importantly, palatal myoclonus is not epileptic in nature; its myoclonic activity persists even during sleep, which differentiates it from epileptic myoclonus. Patients, often in younger age groups when symptomatic, will experience continuous palatal movements with an associated clicking or buzzing sound. A key point is the persistence of these myoclonic movements during sleep, which helps distinguish it from seizure activity that typically abates when asleep. Diagnosis is clinical, bolstered by imaging such as MRI to evaluate for lesions in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle. Differential diagnoses include myoclonic seizures (which usually do not persist during sleep) and other movement disorders. Electrophysiological studies can sometimes assist in clarification. Management of palatal myoclonus is often symptomatic. Medications such as clonazepam, valproic acid, and lamotrigine have been used with variable success. When considering pregnancy or lactation, the risks of these agents must be weighed carefully; for example, valproic acid is contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenicity, whereas benzodiazepines require careful dosing and monitoring. Option A (Caudate atrophy): Incorrect as caudate atrophy is more typically associated with other movement disorders such as Huntington\u2019s disease. Option B (It is myoclonic seizure): Incorrect because palatal myoclonus is not epileptic, and the movements persist during sleep. Option C (It is palate myoclonus and it may continue in sleep): Correct, as it accurately describes the condition. Option D (Not movement disorder and will disappear in sleep): Incorrect because palatal myoclonus is a recognized movement disorder and, importantly, the movements do not disappear in sleep. 1. Palatal myoclonus is often associated with lesions in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle. 2. The persistence of movements during sleep is a key differentiator from epileptic events. 3. Audible clicking sounds can be a significant clinical clue. Recent studies continue to emphasize the need for detailed neuroimaging in patients presenting with palatal myoclonus to identify potential brainstem lesions. There is ongoing research into the efficacy of various medications, but management remains symptomatic, tailored to individual patient needs.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Hemiballismus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by violent, involuntary, flinging movements of the extremities. It is typically unilateral and is most commonly associated with lesions affecting a specific part of the basal ganglia circuit. The most common cause of hemiballismus is a lesion in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), often due to small vessel strokes. The STN normally exerts an excitatory influence on the globus pallidus internus, and its dysfunction leads to decreased inhibitory output from the basal ganglia, resulting in excessive movement. Clinically, patients present with sudden onset of contralateral, violent, ballistic movements typically affecting the proximal limb muscles. Recognition of this characteristic presentation is crucial for localization of the lesion to the STN. Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds supported by neuroimaging (typically MRI) to detect the vascular lesion most commonly in the subthalamic nucleus. Differential diagnoses include other hyperkinetic disorders such as chorea or dystonia; however, the abrupt onset and severity of movements in hemiballismus are distinguishing features. Acute management includes controlling the hyperkinetic movements using medications such as high-dose benzodiazepines (e.g., clonazepam) or antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol). In cases of stroke, supportive care is essential. For pregnant or lactating patients, treatment options must be carefully selected, often favoring benzodiazepines with careful dosing after evaluating the risk-benefit ratio. Option A (STN): Correct, because hemiballismus is most frequently due to lesions of the subthalamic nucleus. Other options, if present, would typically either mislocalize the lesion or represent incorrect etiologies. 1. Hemiballismus most commonly results from vascular insults to the subthalamic nucleus. 2. The violent, involuntary flinging movements are typically contralateral to the lesion. 3. Prompt neuroimaging is crucial to confirm the diagnosis and rule out alternative etiologies. Current guidelines stress the importance of rapid imaging in suspected stroke-induced hemiballismus. Recent studies have refined medical management strategies, with emerging evidence supporting the tailored use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics while highlighting considerations in special populations such as pregnant or lactating patients.",

    "option_c": "Periodic limb movement disorder",
    "option_d": "Narcolepsy",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson disease is frequently associated with several sleep disorders. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs with an urge to move, typically worsening at rest and in the evenings. Dopamine agonists, which are used to treat motor symptoms in Parkinson\u2019s disease, are also effective in alleviating RLS symptoms by addressing dopaminergic dysfunction. RLS is thought to result from dysfunction in the dopaminergic pathways, particularly within the subcortical regions of the brain (like the basal ganglia). Additionally, iron deficiency in the central nervous system may contribute to impaired dopamine signaling. Dopamine agonists help compensate for the deficient dopaminergic tone, thereby reducing the symptoms. Patients with Parkinson disease may present with various sleep issues. RLS typically presents as an urge to move the legs accompanied by uncomfortable and sometimes painful sensations that improve with movement. In Parkinson\u2019s patients, these symptoms can be exacerbated by the underlying dopaminergic deficits, hence the improvement seen with dopamine agonists. Evaluation includes a thorough history of symptom timing, nature of sensations, and factors that exacerbate or relieve symptoms. Differential diagnoses include periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) \u2013 which involves repetitive limb movements without the sensory discomfort \u2013 and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is characterized by abnormal motor activity during REM sleep. Clinical context, including the temporal pattern and associated features, helps differentiate these conditions. The first-line treatment for RLS is the use of dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole). Other treatment considerations include iron supplementation if the patient has iron deficiency. For patients who are pregnant or lactating, non-pharmacologic approaches and iron supplementation are preferred due to the limited safety data on dopamine agonists during pregnancy and lactation. Option A (Restless legs syndrome) is the correct answer because dopamine agonists are known to improve RLS symptoms. Option B (REM behavior disorder) is typically managed with clonazepam or melatonin. Option C (Periodic limb movement disorder) may have some overlapping treatment options but does not classically respond to dopamine agonists in the same way as RLS. Option D (Narcolepsy) is related to hypocretin deficiency and managed with stimulants and other agents, not dopamine agonists. 1. RLS presents with an urge to move the legs and is often worse during periods of inactivity and in the evening. 2. Dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment for RLS even in the context of Parkinson disease. 3. Always evaluate iron levels in patients with RLS as iron deficiency can worsen symptoms. Recent clinical guidelines continue to support the use of dopamine agonists as first-line therapy for RLS. Ongoing research into the role of iron metabolism in RLS may further refine treatment strategies, and there is still active investigation into the optimal management of sleep disorders in Parkinson disease.",

Although his tics can vary in severity, they occur frequently during the day, and he has never been tic free for more than a few weeks during the past year. He has no other past medical history and takes no medication. Other than his tics, his neurological examination is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate description of this patient\u2019s symptoms?",
    "option_a": "Chronic tic disorder",
    "option_b": "Stereotypes",
    "option_c": "Tourette syndrome",
    "option_d": "Transient tic disorder",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic. The symptoms must persist for more than one year, with onset before the age of 18. This definition distinguishes it from transient or chronic tic disorders. The pathophysiology involves dysfunction of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, with both genetic and environmental factors playing a role. Abnormalities in neurotransmitter systems, particularly dopamine, are implicated in the development of tics. In this case, the patient is an 11-year-old boy with a 14-month history of both motor (eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, forehead raising) and vocal tics (barking sound). The persistence of tics without a tic-free period longer than a few weeks over the past year fulfills the criteria for Tourette syndrome. Diagnosis is largely clinical. Differential diagnoses include transient tic disorder (lasting less than one year), chronic motor or vocal tic disorder (involving either motor or vocal tics alone for more than one year), and stereotypies (which are repetitive, non-goal-directed behaviors, typically seen in developmental disorders). A detailed history and examination help differentiate these conditions. Management generally starts with education, behavioral therapy (such as habit reversal training), and supportive interventions. Medication (e.g., low-dose antipsychotics) is considered for severe cases. In children and adolescents, non-pharmacologic therapies are preferred. In pregnant or lactating patients, medication choices should be carefully considered to minimize fetal or neonatal exposure, with behavioral therapy often being the first-line choice. Option A (Chronic tic disorder) is incorrect because it would be used when either motor or vocal tics (but not both) persist for over a year. Option B (Stereotypes) refers to repetitive behaviors that are usually not considered tics and are seen in other contexts such as autism. Option C (Tourette syndrome) is the correct choice given the combination of motor and vocal tics lasting more than one year. Option D (Transient tic disorder) is excluded because the duration of symptoms exceeds one year. 1. Tourette syndrome requires both motor and at least one vocal tic, with symptoms persisting for more than one year. 2. Many children with Tourette syndrome experience fluctuations in symptom severity. 3. Behavioral interventions, particularly habit reversal therapy, are foundational in management. Recent studies emphasize the importance of early behavioral interventions and support the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy as an effective first-line treatment. Updated guidelines continue to promote non-pharmacologic management for milder cases and careful medication use when necessary.",

    "option_c": "PSP",
    "option_d": "MSA",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is an atypical parkinsonian syndrome that typically presents with asymmetric motor symptoms, including rigidity, myoclonus, and unique features such as cortical sensory loss and limb apraxia. CBD is a tauopathy, meaning it is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal tau proteins in both the cortex and basal ganglia. This neurodegenerative process leads to a combination of extrapyramidal symptoms and higher cortical dysfunctions, such as apraxia and sensory deficits. The 60-year-old male presents with progressive difficulty using his right hand, accompanied by myoclonus, rigidity, and cortical sensory loss. The asymmetric onset and involvement of cortical sensory deficits strongly support a diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration. The absence of early falls further differentiates it from other parkinsonian disorders like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The diagnosis of CBD is primarily clinical, based on the presence of asymmetric parkinsonian features along with cortical signs (e.g., apraxia, sensory loss). Differential diagnoses include: \u2022 Basal ganglia stroke, which is usually of sudden onset and not progressive. \u2022 Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), typically associated with early falls and vertical gaze palsy. \u2022 Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), which usually includes significant autonomic dysfunction and cerebellar signs. There is no disease-modifying treatment for CBD. Management is supportive and symptomatic. Physical and occupational therapy are key to maintaining function. Medications such as levodopa may be trialed, but the response is often limited. In the context of pregnancy and lactation, although rare in CBD, any symptomatic treatment should be carefully evaluated considering potential risks. Option A (Corticobasal degeneration) is correct because the clinical picture of asymmetric rigidity, myoclonus, and cortical sensory loss is most consistent with CBD. Option B (Basal ganglia stroke) is typically abrupt in onset rather than progressive. Option C (PSP) usually presents with early falls and vertical gaze palsy, features not present in this case. Option D (MSA) generally involves significant autonomic dysfunction and possibly cerebellar signs, which are not described here. 1. CBD often presents with asymmetric motor symptoms and cortical sensory deficits. 2. The condition is a tauopathy, emphasizing the role of abnormal tau protein deposition. 3. Symptomatic management and supportive care are the cornerstones of treatment. Current research is exploring tau-directed therapies for CBD, but to date, management remains supportive. Consensus guidelines emphasize a multidisciplinary approach, including physical and occupational therapy, to maximize quality of life.",

    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson disease (PD) can have familial forms involving specific genetic mutations. LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) gene mutations, particularly the G2019S variant, are recognized as the most common genetic cause in familial Parkinson\u2019s disease, and may also be seen in sporadic cases. Mutations in the LRRK2 gene lead to altered kinase activity, contributing to abnormal protein phosphorylation and downstream neurodegenerative processes. This mutation results in dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra, paralleling the pathology seen in idiopathic PD. Patients with LRRK2-related Parkinson\u2019s disease typically present with clinical features that are indistinguishable from idiopathic PD, including motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. Individuals with this mutation often have a family history of PD. Genetic testing may be considered in patients with a familial history of Parkinson\u2019s disease, particularly in populations where LRRK2 mutations are prevalent. Differential genetic considerations include other PARK genes (e.g., PARK2 for parkin, PINK1 mutations) which typically present with early-onset PD. The management of PD with LRRK2 mutations is similar to that of idiopathic PD, focusing on symptomatic treatment with levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, and adjunctive therapies. Genetic counseling is recommended for affected families. In pregnancy and lactation, treatment regimens need careful consideration to balance maternal benefits with potential fetal risks, and multidisciplinary management is advised. Option A (LRRK2) is correct. Option B, 'PARK', is vague as it refers broadly to any gene locus associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease rather than the specific most common familial gene. Option C (PINK) refers to PINK1 mutations, which are associated with early-onset PD but are not the most common familial cause. Option D is absent. 1. LRRK2 is the most common genetic mutation found in familial Parkinson disease, especially in certain ethnic groups. 2. The clinical presentation of LRRK2-associated PD is similar to idiopathic PD. 3. Genetic testing and counseling are pivotal for patients with a strong family history of PD. Recent research continues to underscore the prevalence of LRRK2 mutations in familial Parkinson\u2019s disease. Ongoing studies are investigating targeted therapies to modulate LRRK2 activity, and updated guidelines reinforce the role of genetic testing in selected patients with a familial pattern.",

    "explanation": "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy characterized by parkinsonism with a predominance of axial rigidity, postural instability with frequent falls, and a very distinctive supranuclear vertical gaze palsy. This vertical gaze abnormality\u2014especially affecting upward gaze\u2014is a key clinical clue that helps distinguish PSP from other parkinsonian syndromes. PSP is associated with abnormal accumulation of tau protein (4-repeat tau isoforms) leading to neurofibrillary tangles. This pathology is most prominent in the brainstem, basal ganglia, and frontal cortex. The degeneration of neurons in regions such as the rostral midbrain underlies the impairment of vertical gaze as well as axial rigidity and postural instability. Clinically, patients present with early postural instability, falls, axial rigidity, and difficulty with vertical eye movements. The presence of a supranuclear gaze palsy\u2014typically starting with impaired voluntary vertical eye movement\u2014is a hallmark and distinguishes PSP from idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, where eye movement abnormalities (if they occur) are usually late in the disease. The differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease (asymmetric onset, resting tremor, typically preserved early vertical gaze), Multiple System Atrophy (prominent autonomic dysfunction and cerebellar signs), Corticobasal Degeneration (asymmetric rigidity, apraxia, alien limb phenomenon), and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Brain imaging often reveals midbrain atrophy (\u2018hummingbird sign\u2019) which supports the diagnosis of PSP. There is no disease\u2010modifying therapy for PSP; management is symptomatic. Levodopa trials may be attempted although benefit is often minimal. Supportive care, including physical, occupational, and speech therapy, is crucial along with fall prevention strategies. Given that PSP predominantly affects older adults, pregnancy and lactation issues are generally not applicable; however, for younger patients with parkinsonian syndromes, medication safety profiles must be considered. In typical parkinsonian syndromes: Parkinson\u2019s Disease usually shows asymmetric onset with resting tremor and only later develops eye movement abnormalities; Multiple System Atrophy involves significant autonomic failure; Corticobasal Degeneration is often asymmetric with cortical sensory disturbances and alien limb; Dementia with Lewy Bodies is marked by early cognitive decline and visual hallucinations. Only PSP presents with the classic triad of axial rigidity, parkinsonism, and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, making it the correct choice. \u2022 Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy is a pathognomonic sign of PSP.  \u2022 The \u2018hummingbird sign\u2019 on midbrain imaging is a supportive diagnostic feature.  \u2022 Poor or minimal response to levodopa is common in PSP. Recent research continues to investigate tau-targeted therapies for PSP, though current management remains symptomatic. International consensus guidelines emphasize early recognition of the gaze palsy and appropriate supportive measures to improve quality of life.",
