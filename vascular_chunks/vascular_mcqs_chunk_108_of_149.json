    "question": "Young patient, history of liver transplant on cyclosporine, presented to the clinic with severe lower limbs tremors that interferes with his life. He has no other symptoms. Examination evident for legs tremor, no other signs. No family history of movement disorders. What is the best treatment option?",
    "option_a": "Start propranolol",
    "option_b": "Start primipexol",
    "option_c": "Decrease cyclosporine dose",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent routinely used in transplant recipients. It is known to elicit neurotoxic effects including tremor, which is a recognized complication related to its dose-dependent neuroexcitatory properties. Cyclosporine-induced tremor is thought to result from its interference with neuronal calcineurin activity, which alters neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability. This neurotoxicity is dose-dependent, with higher concentrations being more likely to cause movement disorders. In transplant recipients, tremors may emerge as an isolated neurological side effect of cyclosporine. In this case, the severe lower limb tremor that significantly interferes with daily living highlights the clinical impact of cyclosporine neurotoxicity. Evaluation includes reviewing the patient's medication regimen, assessing cyclosporine trough levels, and excluding other causes such as essential tremor or metabolic disturbances. The temporal association with cyclosporine use and absence of a family history of movement disorders further supports the diagnosis. The first-line approach is to decrease the cyclosporine dose if clinically feasible and safe, to reduce the neurotoxic effects while still providing adequate immunosuppression. If dose reduction is not sufficient or feasible due to the risk of graft rejection, symptomatic management with beta blockers (e.g., propranolol) may be considered as a second-line measure. In pregnancy and lactation, cyclosporine levels should be carefully monitored, and any dose adjustments should be balanced against the risk of rejection, with interdisciplinary consultation recommended. Option C (Decrease cyclosporine dose) is correct as it directly addresses the underlying cause of the tremor by reducing the neurotoxic drug burden. Option A (Start propranolol) may be used for symptomatic control but does not treat the root cause. Option B (Start primipexol), a dopamine agonist, is inappropriate in this context. \u2022 Always evaluate cyclosporine trough levels in transplant patients presenting with new-onset tremor. \u2022 Dose reductions, when safely possible, can resolve neurotoxic symptoms without compromising graft function. \u2022 A multidisciplinary approach is critical to balance immunosuppressive requirements and management of side effects. Recent transplant literature emphasizes targeted cyclosporine dose adjustments to mitigate neurotoxic side effects. Emerging studies support this approach as a means to improve patient quality of life while maintaining adequate immunosuppression, with special recommendations for careful monitoring during pregnancy and lactation.",

    "question": "What is the most common hereditary chorea?",

    "option_c": "Benign hereditary chorea",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Hereditary chorea encompasses a group of genetic movement disorders characterized by involuntary, dance-like movements. Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common and well-recognized disorder among hereditary choreas due to its autosomal dominant inheritance. HD is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene, which leads to the production of an abnormal huntingtin protein that aggregates and causes neuronal degeneration, particularly in the striatum. This progressive degeneration manifests as chorea, along with cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. HD typically presents in mid-adulthood with chorea, emotional changes, and cognitive decline. Its hereditary nature means that a positive family history is usually evident, and the clinical evolution correlates with the underlying neurodegenerative process. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical features and a positive family history, with genetic testing confirming the CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene. Differential diagnoses include benign hereditary chorea (which is rarer and often presents earlier) and Sydenham chorea (which is acquired and post-streptococcal in nature). Treatment of HD is mainly symptomatic, with first-line therapies such as tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine used to control chorea, and antipsychotics addressing psychiatric symptoms. Given the progressive nature of the disease, a multidisciplinary approach is essential, including physical, occupational, and speech therapy. In pregnancy and lactation, certain medications like tetrabenazine are contraindicated, so treatment regimens must be carefully adjusted with risks and benefits thoroughly assessed. Option A (HD) is correct because Huntington's disease is the most common hereditary chorea. Option B (Sydenham chorea) does not apply as it is an acquired, post-infectious condition. Option C (Benign hereditary chorea) is considerably less common and typically presents earlier in life with a non-progressive course. \u2022 HD generally presents in the third or fourth decade of life with a triad of chorea, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive deterioration. \u2022 Genetic testing confirming CAG repeat expansion is diagnostic. \u2022 Family history is a key aspect in suspecting HD given its autosomal dominant inheritance. Ongoing research in Huntington's disease is targeting gene therapies and disease-modifying treatments. Current clinical practice, however, remains focused on symptomatic management, with evolving guidelines on the safe use of medications in pregnancy and lactation.",

    "question": "Typical case scenario of Parkinson disease asking what is the highest valuable test to confirm diagnosis?",

    "option_c": "Pathological",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. The diagnosis is predominantly based on clinical findings. PD involves degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia. This results in impaired motor control and the characteristic movement abnormalities observed in PD. The clinical diagnosis of PD relies on the identification of cardinal motor features, often supported by a positive response to levodopa. The classic presentation includes a 'pill-rolling' resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which help differentiate it from other movement disorders. Diagnosis is generally clinical, based on criteria such as the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank guidelines. While radiological tools like the DaTscan can be used in ambiguous cases to support the diagnosis, no imaging modality can replace the clinical evaluation. The differential diagnosis includes atypical parkinsonism, essential tremor, and drug-induced parkinsonism. The mainstay of treatment for PD is dopaminergic replacement therapy, with levodopa/carbidopa being the first-line treatment. Dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, and anticholinergics may be used as adjuncts. In the context of pregnancy and lactation, levodopa is generally preferred given a better-understood safety profile, while the use of dopamine agonists must be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Option A (Clinical) is correct because the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is fundamentally a clinical one based on patient history and neurological examination. Option B (Radiological) offers supportive information in unclear cases but is not definitive, and Option C (Pathological) is only utilized post-mortem for confirmation. \u2022 The diagnosis of PD is primarily clinical; response to levodopa can serve as a supportive diagnostic tool. \u2022 Imaging is reserved for atypical or uncertain cases. \u2022 Early recognition and treatment are crucial for improving quality of life. Emerging research continues to refine diagnostic criteria, with advances in biomarkers and imaging techniques being studied. However, current guidelines reaffirm that clinical evaluation remains the gold standard for diagnosing Parkinson's disease, with careful consideration given to therapy options during pregnancy and lactation.",

    "question": "What is the commonest pathological changes in MSA?",
    "option_a": "Tufted astrocytes",
    "option_b": "Glial cytoplasmic inclusions",
    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which abnormal protein accumulations in glial cells lead to a combination of parkinsonian, cerebellar, and autonomic features. The key pathological hallmark is the presence of glial cytoplasmic inclusions. In MSA, misfolded \u03b1\u2010synuclein accumulates within the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes, forming glial cytoplasmic inclusions (also known as Papp-Lantos bodies). This abnormal protein aggregation results in widespread neurodegeneration, affecting the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and autonomic centers. The process leads to impaired neuronal function and eventual cell death. The pathological findings correlate with the clinical features seen in MSA. Depending on the distribution of neurodegeneration, patients may present with parkinsonism (MSA-P subtype), cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C subtype), or significant autonomic dysfunction such as orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, and impotence. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by neuroimaging and autonomic testing. MRI may reveal atrophy in the striatum, brainstem, or cerebellum (such as the 'hot cross bun' sign in the pons). Differential diagnoses include Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and other atypical parkinsonian disorders. A definitive diagnosis relies on neuropathological confirmation at autopsy. There is currently no cure for MSA. Management is symptomatic and supportive. First-line therapies include dopaminergic medications for parkinsonian features, though they are often less effective than in idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. Autonomic symptoms are managed with volume-expanding agents, compression stockings, and medications like midodrine. Rehabilitation, physical therapy, and supportive care are crucial. In pregnancy and lactation, medication effects must be weighed carefully; for example, drugs used to manage autonomic symptoms have varying safety profiles and require individualized risk\u2013benefit analysis. Option B (Glial cytoplasmic inclusions) is correct because it directly represents the typical pathological hallmark in MSA. Option A (Tufted astrocytes) is seen in other tauopathies like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and is not characteristic for MSA. Options C and D are not provided. 1. Glial cytoplasmic inclusions that are \u03b1-synuclein positive are pathognomonic for MSA. 2. MSA can manifest with varying combinations of parkinsonian, cerebellar, and autonomic symptoms. 3. The 'hot cross bun' sign on MRI is suggestive of MSA, especially the cerebellar subtype. Recent studies continue to explore the role of \u03b1-synuclein pathology in MSA, with research focused on biomarkers for earlier diagnosis. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting protein aggregation and neuroinflammation are under investigation, although none have yet entered routine clinical practice.",

    "question": "61 years old male with 2 years history of limbs tremors and bradykinesia. On exam he has postural instability and vertical downgaze limitation. Diagnosis?",
    "option_a": "PSP",

    "option_c": "MSA",
    "option_d": "AD",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy that primarily affects gait, balance, and eye movements. It is one of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. PSP is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of tau protein in neurons and glia, particularly in midbrain structures such as the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus and other brainstem regions. This tau pathology causes degeneration in areas responsible for vertical gaze and postural control. Clinically, PSP presents with early postural instability with recurrent falls, bradykinesia, and characteristic vertical gaze palsy, especially for downgaze. These features help differentiate it from idiopathic Parkinson's disease, where vertical gaze is typically preserved until later stages. The diagnostic evaluation involves careful clinical assessment and neuroimaging. MRI may show midbrain atrophy with a characteristic 'hummingbird sign'. Differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple system atrophy, and corticobasal degeneration. Key features like early gait instability and vertical gaze palsy point to PSP. Management of PSP is largely supportive. First-line interventions include physical and occupational therapy to address gait and balance issues. Pharmacological treatments, such as a trial of levodopa, are usually less effective. Emerging research on tau-targeted therapies may offer new treatment avenues in the future. In older patients, special considerations for polypharmacy and comorbidities are crucial. Although PSP typically affects older individuals, any patient of childbearing age would require careful evaluation of medication safety in pregnancy and lactation. Option A (PSP) is correct because the patient\u2019s presentation featuring postural instability and vertical downgaze limitation is classic for PSP. Option B (CBD) often presents with asymmetric rigidity and apraxia rather than vertical gaze palsy. Option C (MSA) does not typically feature vertical gaze limitations while Option D (AD) is unrelated to these movement disorder symptoms. 1. Vertical gaze palsy, particularly for downgaze, is a red flag for PSP. 2. Early falls and postural instability are hallmark clinical features that help differentiate PSP from idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. 3. MRI findings such as the 'hummingbird sign' can be very supportive of a PSP diagnosis. Recent guidelines emphasize the importance of early recognition of PSP and the integration of multidisciplinary care. Research is ongoing into tau-targeted therapies and biomarkers for early diagnosis, which may eventually change the management landscape for PSP.",

    "question": "42 years old female has gait difficulty. When she stands still she feels very dizzy but when she wakes she no longer has dizziness. EMG was done and shows subtle high frequency tremors in legs. What is the best treatment?",
    "option_a": "Propranolol",
    "option_b": "Clonazepam",
    "option_c": "Pramipexol",
    "option_d": "DBS",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Primary orthostatic tremor (POT) is a rare movement disorder characterized by rapid, high-frequency tremors in the legs that are predominantly symptomatic when the patient is standing still, leading to unsteadiness and dizziness. The underlying mechanism of orthostatic tremor is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve a central oscillator in the brain generating a synchronized, high-frequency signal (typically around 13-18 Hz) that manifests specifically when weight-bearing. Electrophysiological studies, particularly electromyography (EMG), reveal these distinctive tremors. Patients typically describe a sensation of instability or unsteadiness when standing, which improves or resolves with walking or sitting. The high-frequency tremors may be subtle clinically, but they are reliably detected on EMG. This presentation helps distinguish orthostatic tremor from other tremor disorders. EMG is the key diagnostic test, as it characteristically demonstrates a high-frequency tremor in the leg muscles during standing. Common differentials include essential tremor, which usually presents with hand tremors during action or posture maintenance, and psychogenic tremor, which has variable frequency and distribution. A careful clinical history and electrophysiological testing aid in differentiation. Clonazepam is considered the first-line treatment for primary orthostatic tremor, as it can improve symptoms by reducing the abnormal oscillatory activity. Gabapentin is a reasonable second-line option for patients who do not respond to or tolerate clonazepam. Propranolol and pramipexole are not effective for orthostatic tremor and are used in the treatment of essential tremor and Parkinson\u2019s disease, respectively. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is not typically indicated. In pregnancy and lactation, treatment decisions become complex. Clonazepam (a benzodiazepine) has potential risks during pregnancy and breastfeeding; if treatment is deemed necessary, a careful risk-benefit analysis, possibly guided by a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, is essential. Option A (Propranolol) is primarily used for essential tremor. Option B (Clonazepam) is correct as it is the first-line treatment for orthostatic tremor. Option C (Pramipexol) is used in Parkinson\u2019s disease and is not indicated here. Option D (DBS) is reserved for select refractory cases of certain movement disorders and is not standard for orthostatic tremor. 1. Orthostatic tremor is best diagnosed by its high-frequency tremor on EMG that is present only upon standing. 2. Clonazepam is the mainstay of treatment despite limited evidence from large trials. 3. The symptom of alleviation upon walking is a key clinical clue. Recent literature continues to validate clonazepam\u2019s efficacy in reducing symptoms of orthostatic tremor, though controlled studies remain sparse due to the rarity of the condition. Research into the underlying pathophysiology and alternative treatment options, such as gabapentin, remains active.",

    "option_d": "Truncal Hypoalgesia",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "The cerebellum is divided into the vermis and hemispheres, with the vermis playing a crucial role in maintaining axial stability and posture. Lesions in the rostral (anterior) vermis primarily impact midline control. Damage to the rostral vermis disrupts neural pathways that coordinate truncal stability and balance. This results in difficulties with maintaining a steady posture, especially during stance, leading to a compensatory wide-based gait as the patient attempts to improve stability. Clinically, lesions in the rostral vermis present with truncal ataxia, which manifests as a wide-based gait. Other cerebellar signs like limb dysmetria (e.g., impaired finger-to-nose test) are more characteristic of hemispheric cerebellar lesions. Nystagmus may occur with lesions affecting the vestibulocerebellum, not typically seen with isolated rostral vermal lesions. Diagnosis relies on clinical examination and neuroimaging (usually MRI). Differential diagnoses include cerebellar stroke, cerebellar degenerative disorders, and tumors. Specific testing (e.g., detailed coordination assessments) helps localize lesions to the vermis versus the hemispheres. Management of cerebellar lesions centers on treating the underlying cause, which may include vascular, neoplastic, or demyelinating processes. Rehabilitation, including physical and occupational therapy, is essential in managing gait and balance impairments. In pregnant patients, imaging studies such as MRI (without gadolinium if possible) are preferred for evaluation, and therapy is tailored to minimize risks. Surgical intervention, if required, must carefully balance maternal and fetal risks. Option A (Nystagmus) is more linked to lesions of the vestibulo-cerebellum. Option B (Wide based gait) is correct as it directly reflects the loss of truncal stability from rostral vermal lesions. Option C (Impaired finger/nose test) is typically associated with hemispheric cerebellar dysfunction rather than midline vermal lesions. Option D (Truncal Hypoalgesia) is not a recognized feature of cerebellar vermal pathology. 1. Rostral vermal lesions predominantly result in truncal ataxia, manifesting as a wide-based gait. 2. Midline cerebellar damage leads to balance and gait disturbances rather than limb dysmetria. 3. Accurate localization of cerebellar lesions is essential for targeted therapy. Current research continues to elucidate the specific roles of cerebellar subregions in motor control. Advances in neuroimaging have enhanced the ability to localize lesions, and rehabilitation strategies are evolving to better address balance and gait disturbances, with ongoing studies into neuromodulatory treatments.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This case describes a 40\u2010year-old male with a classic triad of dementia, depression, and chorea, along with a family history of similar illness. These features are hallmark findings in Huntington's disease, an autosomal dominant disorder that usually presents in mid-life with neurological and psychiatric manifestations. Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene on chromosome 4. The mutant protein leads to neuronal degeneration primarily in the striatum (especially the caudate nucleus), resulting in the motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms observed. Recent research is investigating gene-silencing techniques as potential therapies, though none have yet altered the disease course. The clinical findings \u2013 chorea, behavioral changes, and cognitive deterioration \u2013 directly correlate with striatal degeneration. The positive family history reinforces an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Neuroimaging typically shows caudate nucleus atrophy, which supports the diagnosis. The diagnosis is confirmed via genetic testing for the expanded CAG repeat. Differential diagnoses include dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), which has overlapping symptoms but a different ethnic predilection and additional features (like ataxia and seizures), and neuroacanthocytosis, which would include acanthocytes on the blood smear. Clinical history and imaging help distinguish these entities. There is no cure; management is symptomatic. For motor symptoms such as chorea, medications like tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine are used, whereas psychiatric symptoms may be managed with SSRIs or other psychotropic medications. Multidisciplinary care is essential. In pregnancy and lactation, the use of drugs such as tetrabenazine requires careful risk\u2013benefit assessment, as safety data are limited. Counseling and support remain central to management. Option A (DRPLA) is incorrect; although also an autosomal dominant disorder, it has a different clinical spectrum (often with seizures and ataxia) and is more common in Japan. Option B is correct. Option C (Depression) does not account for the full neurological picture (chorea and cognitive decline). Option D (Acanthocytosis) involves abnormal red blood cells and has a different clinical presentation. 1. Huntington's disease typically presents with the triad of chorea, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances in mid-life. 2. Family history of a similar condition is a major clue. 3. Brain imaging often reveals caudate atrophy. Recent studies are focused on gene therapy and RNA-targeted treatments to slow or halt neurodegeneration, though current management remains symptomatic. Updated guidelines emphasize multidisciplinary management addressing both motor and nonmotor symptoms.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "In Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) management, motor complications like dyskinesia and motor fluctuations are common after several years of levodopa therapy. This case describes a patient on a high-frequency sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa) regimen for 6 years, now experiencing worsening dyskinesia along with bradykinesia during daily activities, as well as nonmotor symptoms such as depression and sleep disturbances. Long-term intermittent exposure to levodopa leads to pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors, which is thought to underlie the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Motor fluctuations occur as the medication\u2019s effect wears off, resulting in off-period bradykinesia and rigidity. The coexistence of dyskinesia with motor slowing (bradykinesia) in a patient with established PD suggests a levodopa dosing issue. High peak doses tend to produce dyskinesia, while reduced dopaminergic stimulation leads to off periods. The depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances are recognized nonmotor symptoms of PD but also may be exacerbated by medication fluctuations. Assessment involves a careful review of the timing of motor fluctuations relative to medication dosing. Differential diagnoses include advanced Parkinson's disease with motor complications versus other atypical parkinsonian syndromes. A detailed medication review and response assessment with adjustments help refine the diagnosis. The goal is to smooth the dopaminergic stimulation, thereby reducing dyskinesia while minimizing off periods. The first step is to reduce the total levodopa dose, which can help decrease the peak-dose dyskinesia. Adjunct therapy with a dopamine agonist can help maintain motor control. Amantadine is also used for dyskinesia but is generally added when levodopa dose reduction is insufficient. In pregnancy and lactation, levodopa is usually the treatment of choice for PD, and dopamine agonists are generally used with caution due to limited safety data. Option A (\u2191 sinemet dose + add Amantadine) is problematic because increasing the levodopa dose would likely exacerbate the dyskinesia despite the use of amantadine. Option B (\u2193 sinemet dose + add dopa agonist) is preferred as it reduces peak-dose dyskinesia while maintaining dopaminergic stimulation during off periods. Option C (\u2191 sinemet + start SSRI) does not address the dyskinesia and could worsen motor fluctuations. Option D (Add COMT inhibitor) would prolong levodopa's effect but may also increase dyskinetic complications by further increasing overall dopaminergic levels. 1. In PD, reducing levodopa dose can decrease dyskinesia but may worsen off symptoms if not appropriately balanced. 2. Adding a dopamine agonist can help smooth out dopaminergic stimulation and reduce motor fluctuations. 3. Amantadine is useful in managing dyskinesia, but its use should be in the context of overall dopaminergic management. Recent guidelines stress the importance of individualizing treatment regimens in advanced PD. Studies support reducing levodopa dosage and adding non-levodopa agents (dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, or amantadine) to manage fluctuations and dyskinesia. Ongoing research is assessing the long-term outcomes of such combination therapies.",

    "explanation": "In early Parkinson\u2019s disease, a trial of levodopa (dopa trial) is a classic diagnostic tool. This test helps establish the responsiveness of parkinsonian symptoms to dopaminergic therapy, thus supporting a diagnosis of PD. Parkinson\u2019s disease is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to a reduction in striatal dopamine. A positive response to levodopa confirms that diminished dopamine levels are central to the pathophysiology. The patient\u2019s asymmetrical tremors, bradykinesia, and falls are typical of PD. A dopa trial provides both diagnostic clarity and a potential therapeutic benefit by temporarily ameliorating symptoms. While the dopa trial remains a cost-effective and easily implemented diagnostic maneuver in suspected PD, the differential includes drug-induced parkinsonism, vascular parkinsonism, and atypical parkinsonian syndromes like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In ambiguous cases, additional imaging such as a DaTscan (dopamine transporter imaging) may be considered, but it is not first-line. A positive response to a dopa trial not only supports the diagnosis but also guides future dopaminergic therapy. In early disease, the levodopa regimen can be tailored to minimize motor fluctuations. In pregnancy and lactation, levodopa is generally preferred over dopamine agonists due to a comparatively better safety profile, but multidisciplinary counseling is essential. Option A (Dopa trial) is correct because an improvement after administering levodopa helps confirm the diagnosis. Option B (Dopa PET scan) is a more specialized and less accessible investigation that is not routinely used in this scenario. Option C is non-informative, and Option D is not provided. 1.

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by a combination of parkinsonian motor symptoms and early cognitive impairment, particularly with prominent visual hallucinations and fluctuations in cognition and attention. DLB involves abnormal deposition of alpha-synuclein (Lewy bodies) in cortical and subcortical brain regions, which affect both cognitive processes and motor function. The fluctuating nature of cognition is attributed to widespread cortical involvement. In this patient, the presence of parkinsonism for one year along with visual hallucinations and fluctuating cognition is very suggestive of DLB. In contrast, Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) typically presents with motor symptoms first, with cognitive decline occurring later in the disease course. Differential diagnoses include Parkinson's disease (which usually shows a later onset of dementia), corticobasal degeneration (CBD, usually with asymmetric rigidity and apraxia), and multiple system atrophy (MSA, which involves prominent autonomic dysfunction). The early appearance of visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations strongly favors DLB. Ancillary investigations may include neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing. Management of DLB includes cholinesterase inhibitors (such as rivastigmine) to address cognitive symptoms, and cautious use of atypical antipsychotics for hallucinations due to increased sensitivity in these patients. Motor symptoms are managed cautiously because dopaminergic medications can worsen hallucinations. In pregnancy and lactation, treatment options are limited and require careful consultation given the vulnerability of the fetus or infant. Option A (DLB) is correct based on the clinical presentation. Option B (PD) is less likely as dementia and hallucinations usually occur later in PD. Option C (CBD) typically involves more asymmetric motor symptoms and cortical deficits without marked hallucinations. Option D (MSA) usually presents with significant autonomic dysfunction rather than the cognitive fluctuations and hallucinations seen in DLB. 1. Early visual hallucinations and fluctuating cognition in a parkinsonian patient are highly suggestive of DLB. 2. Patients with DLB often exhibit marked sensitivity to antipsychotics. 3. Distinguishing DLB from PD is critical because of differences in management and timing of cognitive symptom onset. Current diagnostic criteria and research support the early identification of DLB through a combination of clinical features, with new biomarkers and imaging techniques under investigation. Guidelines emphasize the importance of individualized treatment plans that address both cognitive and motor symptoms while minimizing adverse effects.",

    "explanation": "Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is one of the polyglutamine expansion disorders. It is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative condition that typically presents with a wide range of neurological and psychiatric manifestations including myoclonic jerks, generalized seizures, ataxia, chorea, dystonia, and mood disturbances. DRPLA is caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the ATN1 gene. The resultant mutant protein accumulates and exerts toxic effects on neurons primarily in the dentate nucleus, red nucleus, and pallidoluysial regions. This toxic gain-of-function leads to progressive neuronal degeneration. Although it is classically autosomal dominant with anticipation, sporadic cases or a lack of family history may be encountered due to incomplete penetrance or de novo mutations. Patients often present in adolescence or early adulthood with myoclonic jerks and generalized tonic clonic seizures. As the disease progresses, features such as ataxia, chorea, dystonia, and psychiatric abnormalities (e.g., depression) become prominent. The age of onset and the mixed movement disorder picture help differentiate it from other neurodegenerative conditions. The diagnosis is confirmed via genetic testing for the ATN1 gene CAG repeat expansion. Differential considerations include Huntington\u2019s disease, Wilson\u2019s disease, and various spinocerebellar ataxias. Detailed family history and neuroimaging may aid in excluding other conditions, but genetic confirmation is the gold standard. There is no curative treatment. Management is largely symptomatic: antiepileptics for seizure control, benzodiazepines or other agents for myoclonus, and medications or behavioral therapy for movement disorders and psychiatric symptoms. Genetic counseling is recommended for affected families. In pregnancy and lactation, drug choices must be carefully reviewed \u2013 for example, selecting antiepileptics with a safer profile (such as lamotrigine over valproate) and using the minimal effective dose to control symptoms. Option A (DRPLA) is correct. Anderson disease (Option B) does not fit the clinical picture and typically refers to a different metabolic or neurodegenerative condition. Neuroacanthocytosis (Option C) is associated with acanthocytes on a blood smear and a different movement disorder profile. Thus, the combination of myoclonic seizures, chorea, ataxia, psychiatric changes, and the typical age of onset favor DRPLA. 1. DRPLA is a polyglutamine disorder with a variable phenotype including seizures, myoclonus, and chorea. 2. Despite an autosomal dominant inheritance, a negative family history does not exclude the diagnosis. 3. Genetic testing is essential to confirm the diagnosis. Recent studies continue to corroborate the role of CAG repeat expansion in the ATN1 gene as the cause of DRPLA. While no disease\u2010modifying treatments are available, current research focuses on symptomatic management and potential gene\u2010targeted therapies. Guidelines emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach including neurologists, genetic counselors, and psychiatrists.",

    "question": "74 years old male presented with difficulty gait, freezing, cognitive issue, bradykinesia, urinary incontinence. On exam he has limited downgaze and unsteady gait. Brain MRI reported generalized atrophy and large ventricles. Diagnosis?",
    "option_a": "NPH",
    "option_b": "Vascular dementia/vascular parkinsonism",
    "option_c": "PSP",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question distinguishes among causes of gait disturbance and cognitive decline in the elderly. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy notable for parkinsonism with vertical gaze palsy, especially affecting downgaze. PSP is characterized by the pathological accumulation of tau protein within neurons and glia, predominantly affecting the midbrain, basal ganglia, and brainstem. The involvement of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus and other midbrain structures accounts for the vertical gaze palsy, while widespread neurodegeneration contributes to parkinsonian symptoms, gait impairment, and cognitive decline. Patients typically present after the age of 60 with early postural instability, frequent falls, axial rigidity, bradykinesia, and cognitive changes. Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, particularly impaired downgaze, is a hallmark. Although urinary incontinence is also seen in Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), its presence alongside vertical gaze limitation strongly favors PSP. The main differentials include NPH (characterized by the classic triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia, with disproportionate ventricular enlargement on imaging), vascular parkinsonism (which often has a stepwise progression and focal vascular lesions), and other atypical parkinsonian disorders. Neuroimaging in PSP typically reveals midbrain atrophy (the 'hummingbird sign'), even if in some cases generalized atrophy and ventricular enlargement are noted; the clinical eye movement abnormality is key. There is no cure for PSP. Treatment is symptomatic with low-dose levodopa tried for parkinsonian features (often with limited response), and supportive treatments including physical and occupational therapy are crucial. In addition, management of balance and falls is essential. Since PSP typically affects older adults, pregnancy and lactation considerations are not applicable; however, in younger patients with atypical presentations, drug side effect profiles should be carefully considered. Option A (NPH) is less likely given the presence of limited downgaze; Option B (Vascular dementia/vascular parkinsonism) does not typically present with vertical gaze palsy; Option C (PSP) is best supported by the clinical finding of downgaze limitation despite somewhat nonspecific MRI findings. The vertical gaze palsy is a key discriminator favoring PSP over NPH or vascular causes. 1. Vertical gaze palsy, especially in the downward direction, is nearly pathognomonic for PSP. 2. PSP is a tauopathy and has a poor response to dopaminergic therapy. 3. Differentiating PSP from NPH hinges on careful neurological examination for eye movement abnormalities. The latest guidelines stress early recognition of PSP through clinical evaluation and targeted MRI review for midbrain atrophy. While research into tau-targeting therapies is ongoing, current management remains supportive and symptomatic.",

    "question": "What is true about essential physiological tremor?",
    "option_a": "Symmetrical",
    "option_b": "Attenuated by alcohol",
    "option_c": "4-8Hz",
    "option_d": "Hand/head/neck",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A, B, C, D",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders, characterized by an action (postural or kinetic) tremor that is typically observed in the upper limbs, but it can also involve the head, voice, and sometimes the neck. The precise mechanism remains incompletely understood, but it is believed to involve abnormal oscillatory activity within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuitry. There is often a familial predisposition, and alcohol ingestion transiently dampens this abnormal rhythmic activity, hence its clinical effect on tremor amplitude in many patients. Clinically, essential tremor is observed as a bilateral and usually symmetrical tremor that worsens with purposeful movement. Patients frequently note that the tremor improves after a small amount of alcohol. The tremor typically has a frequency in the range of about 4\u20138 Hz, and although the hands are most commonly affected, the head, voice, and occasionally neck may also be involved. Differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease (which has a resting 'pill-rolling' tremor and is often asymmetric), enhanced physiologic tremor (which may occur with anxiety or medication use), and dystonic tremor (associated with abnormal posturing). A detailed history, clinical examination, and, if necessary, neurophysiological studies help differentiate these conditions. The first-line treatments for essential tremor include beta blockers (e.g., propranolol) and primidone. In patients who do not respond to these, alternatives such as topiramate, gabapentin, or benzodiazepines may be considered. In refractory cases, deep brain stimulation may be an option. In pregnancy, the use of propranolol requires caution (generally a category C drug) and primidone is potentially teratogenic (category D or X in some countries), so management requires individualized counseling and risk assessment, often favoring non-pharmacological approaches during pregnancy and lactation where possible. Option A (Symmetrical) is true as essential tremor typically affects both sides equally. Option B (Attenuated by alcohol) is correct and is a classic clinical clue. Option C (4-8Hz) is accurate regarding the typical frequency of the tremor. Option D (Hand/head/neck) is also true as the tremor classically involves these regions. Thus, all options (A, B, C, and D) are correct. 1. Essential tremor is often bilateral and improves with alcohol consumption. 2. The tremor frequency typically falls between 4 and 8 Hz. 3. It can affect not only the hands but also the head, voice, or neck. Recent reviews and treatment guidelines continue to support the use of beta blockers and primidone as first-line therapies. Ongoing research into the underlying pathophysiology is assessing the contributions of cerebellar dysfunction, and newer neuromodulation strategies are being evaluated for drug-refractory cases.",

    "question": "Case of essential palatal myoclonus ask about investigations",
    "option_a": "Temoromandibular joint CT",
    "option_b": "MRI audio canal",
    "option_c": "EEG",
    "option_d": "plain MRI",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Essential palatal myoclonus, also known as palatal tremor, is a movement disorder characterized by rhythmic involuntary contractions of the soft palate. It may occur in isolation (essential) or secondary to other lesions. The condition often results from lesions affecting the Guillain-Mollaret triangle \u2013 an anatomical circuit connecting the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum, the red nucleus, and the inferior olivary nucleus. Damage within this network (e.g., from infarcts, hemorrhage, demyelination, or post-surgical changes) triggers hypertrophic olivary degeneration which underlies the rhythmic myoclonic contractions. Clinically, patients present with a rhythmic clicking sound (often due to the involvement of the tensor veli palatini muscle) and observable palatal movements. In some cases, the phenomenon may extend to other oropharyngeal muscles. It is important to differentiate it from epileptic or psychogenic myoclonus. The investigation of choice is neuroimaging \u2013 specifically brain MRI \u2013 which can reveal lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, or in components of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle. Differential diagnoses include epileptic myoclonus (where an EEG would be more useful) and other brainstem movement disorders. Management is focused on identifying and treating any underlying lesion if present. Symptomatic treatment may involve the use of benzodiazepines or other myorelaxants. In pregnancy and lactation, medications must be chosen with consideration for fetal safety and breastfeeding; options with a safer profile should be prioritized, and non-pharmacologic management considered when possible. Option A (Temporomandibular joint CT) is not relevant because the pathology is central rather than peripheral. Option B (MRI audio canal) is misplaced as the auditory canal is not involved in palatal myoclonus. Option C (EEG) is used primarily to rule out epileptic phenomena but is not diagnostic for palatal myoclonus. Option D (plain MRI) is correct as it is the investigation of choice to evaluate for the structural lesions implicated in essential palatal myoclonus. 1. Essential palatal myoclonus is best assessed with brain MRI to evaluate for lesions in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle. 2. The repetitive clicking sound heard on examination is a classic clinical sign. 3. EEG is not helpful unless there is a suspicion of epileptic activity. Current guidelines and reviews emphasize the role of MRI in the assessment of palatal myoclonus. Recent studies have further delineated the pathophysiological basis of hypertrophic olivary degeneration, guiding future research into targeted symptomatic treatments. Neuroimaging remains the cornerstone for determining whether the myoclonus is idiopathic or secondary to an identifiable lesion.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question describes a patient with movement abnormalities \u2014 dystonia (likely what is meant by 'dystopia'), tremor, and parkinsonism \u2014 along with MRI findings of bilateral basal ganglia and brainstem hyperintensity. This pattern is classic for Wilson disease, a disorder of copper metabolism that leads to copper deposition in the liver, brain, and other tissues. Wilson disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene resulting in impaired copper excretion. The toxic accumulation of copper in tissues causes oxidative damage and gliosis, particularly affecting the basal ganglia and brainstem. On MRI, T2 hyperintensities in these areas are a common radiological finding. Clinically, patients with Wilson disease may exhibit a combination of extrapyramidal symptoms such as tremor, dystonia, and features resembling parkinsonism. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and liver dysfunction are also common. A slit-lamp examination can reveal Kayser-Fleischer rings, which supports the diagnosis. Key investigations include serum ceruloplasmin levels, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and ophthalmologic examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings. Differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease and other atypical parkinsonian syndromes, but the patient\u2019s age, hepatic involvement, and MRI findings redirect the diagnosis to Wilson disease. The first-line treatment for neurological Wilson disease is copper chelation therapy. D-penicillamine is commonly used with a gradual uptitration strategy. Alternatives include trientine and zinc therapy, which can be used especially in patients who cannot tolerate D-penicillamine. In pregnancy and lactation, the risks and benefits must be weighed carefully; D-penicillamine is usually avoided in high doses during pregnancy but may be used when the maternal benefit outweighs the fetal risk, with close monitoring. Option A (Levodopa) is used for Parkinson\u2019s disease and is not disease modifying in Wilson disease. Option B (D-penicillamine) is the correct copper chelator used in Wilson disease. The absence of additional options does not affect the correctness of the given therapeutic choice. 1. Kayser-Fleischer rings are a key clinical sign in neurological Wilson disease. 2. Early initiation of copper chelation therapy is crucial to prevent irreversible neurological damage. Current guidelines, such as those of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, emphasize early diagnosis and treatment with copper chelators. Recent studies focus on optimizing dosing strategies to minimize side effects, and while newer agents are under study, D-penicillamine remains a mainstay of treatment.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is an atypical parkinsonian syndrome characterized by early postural instability, gait disturbances, and ocular motor dysfunction. Levodopa is often trialed in these patients to assess its symptomatic impact. PSP is a tauopathy marked by abnormal accumulations of tau protein in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration in the basal ganglia, brainstem (especially the midbrain), and frontal lobes. The resulting nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficit may be partially responsive to levodopa in some patients. Clinically, PSP presents with bradykinesia, axial rigidity, frequent falls, and vertical gaze palsy. Although the overall response to levodopa is limited, bradykinesia (slowness of movement) is the aspect that sometimes shows a modest improvement during a levodopa trial. In differentiating PSP from Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), one must consider poor levodopa responsiveness, early falls, and the presence of vertical gaze palsy. Other differentials include multiple system atrophy and corticobasal degeneration, each with distinct clinical and imaging features. While there is no cure for PSP, a trial of levodopa is recommended to assess for any symptomatic improvement, particularly in bradykinesia. First-line management includes supportive care with physical therapy and fall prevention measures. In cases of pregnancy or lactation, levodopa is generally considered relatively safe given its long history of use in Parkinson\u2019s disease, but careful individual risk-benefit assessments are necessary. Option A (Bradykinesia) is the correct answer because levodopa, when it shows any benefit in PSP, tends to improve bradykinesia more than other symptoms like tremor. Option B (Tremor) is less characteristic in PSP and is not reliably improved by levodopa. Option C (Gaza) is not relevant to the clinical features of PSP. 1. A trial of levodopa is reasonable in PSP, though the overall response is usually limited. 2. The presence of early falls and vertical gaze palsy are highly suggestive of PSP over idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. Recent research underscores that PSP is largely unresponsive to dopaminergic therapy aside from mild improvements in certain motor features. Current clinical guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary approach focusing on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.",

    "option_c": "nph",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This scenario presents a woman with a 3-year history of frequent falls, an unsteady gait, and evolving urinary symptoms. The MRI finding of midbrain atrophy (often visualized as the 'hummingbird sign') is highly suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). PSP is a neurodegenerative tauopathy that leads to selective neuronal loss and gliosis, particularly in the midbrain, resulting in the classic imaging feature of midbrain atrophy. The tau-related neuronal damage is responsible for the motor and autonomic dysfunction seen in these patients. Patients with PSP typically develop gait instability with early, unexpected falls and may experience urinary urgency progressing to incontinence. Although cognitive and ocular motility disturbances (such as vertical gaze palsy) are also common, the distinct MRI finding of midbrain atrophy is a key indicator. Differential diagnoses include normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which would show ventriculomegaly rather than midbrain atrophy, and multiple system atrophy (MSA), which has differing patterns of atrophy. Recognition of the hummingbird sign on mid-sagittal MRI is central to diagnosing PSP. Management of PSP is predominantly supportive. A trial of levodopa may be attempted, although the response is typically minimal. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and fall prevention strategies form the cornerstone of management. In pregnancy and lactation, therapeutic measures remain largely supportive, and any pharmacologic interventions should be carefully assessed for fetal risk versus maternal benefit. Option A (MSA) is less likely because MSA typically exhibits different brain imaging features, such as pontine or cerebellar atrophy rather than isolated midbrain atrophy. Option B (PSP) is correct given the clinical picture and the midbrain atrophy seen on MRI. Option C (NPH) is less consistent with the MRI findings, which would instead show enlarged ventricles. 1. The 'hummingbird' or 'penguin' sign on mid-sagittal MRI is highly suggestive of PSP. 2. Early falls and gait instability in an older adult should prompt consideration of PSP over other parkinsonian syndromes. Latest research continues to explore targeted therapies for tauopathies such as PSP, but current management remains symptomatic. Updated diagnostic criteria emphasize imaging findings and clinical history, improving early diagnosis and tailored supportive care.",

    "option_c": "",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This case involves a 50-year-old female with imbalance and tremor, along with an MRI showing bilateral hyperintensities in the cerebellar peduncles. This imaging finding is highly characteristic of fragile X\u2010associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder seen in carriers of an FMR1 premutation. FXTAS results from a premutation in the FMR1 gene, which leads to RNA toxicity rather than the complete loss of FMR1 protein seen in full fragile X syndrome. The resultant intranuclear inclusions and white matter changes, particularly in the middle cerebellar peduncles, give rise to the characteristic T2 hyperintensities seen on MRI. FXTAS generally presents with intention tremor, gait ataxia, and cognitive decline in older individuals. Though it is more common and typically more severe in males, female carriers can also be affected, albeit sometimes with a milder phenotype. The MRI 'MCP sign' (middle cerebellar peduncle hyperintensity) is a diagnostic radiologic marker. The differential diagnosis includes paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), and other causes of cerebellar ataxia. However, the specific bilateral hyperintense lesions in the middle cerebellar peduncles point toward FXTAS. Confirmatory genetic testing for the FMR1 premutation is required. Management of FXTAS is largely supportive and symptomatic. Treatment options may include beta-blockers or primidone for tremor control and physical therapy for gait and balance issues. There is no disease\u2010modifying therapy at this time. In women of childbearing potential or during pregnancy/lactation, the safety profile of symptomatic agents (such as beta-blockers) must be carefully evaluated against potential fetal risks. Option A (Fragile X) is intended to indicate FXTAS, which is the correct diagnosis in this context due to the classic MRI findings in the cerebellar peduncles. Option B (Paraneoplastic) is less likely because paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration typically shows more diffuse cerebellar involvement without the specific MCP sign. 1. The 'MCP sign' (bilateral hyperintensity in the middle cerebellar peduncles) is a hallmark of FXTAS. 2. FXTAS should be considered in older adults presenting with tremor and ataxia, even in female carriers of the FMR1 premutation. Current research into FXTAS focuses on understanding the mechanisms of RNA toxicity and developing targeted therapeutic interventions. While management remains symptomatic, ongoing clinical trials aim to address the molecular pathology underlying FXTAS.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson\u2019s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia. In young\u2010onset or juvenile Parkinsonism, treatment strategies are modified to delay the motor complications associated with long\u2010term L-dopa use. Dopamine agonists are used as initial therapy in these patients because they provide symptomatic improvement while reducing the risk of L-dopa induced motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to impaired modulation of basal ganglia circuits. In juvenile Parkinsonism, which begins at a younger age, the long-term exposure to L-dopa increases the risk of developing motor complications. Dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or ropinirole) directly stimulate dopamine receptors, offering a strategy that can control symptoms with a lesser risk of dyskinesia. Current research continues to support the notion that receptor-level agonism can be beneficial in delaying L-dopa related complications. Patients with juvenile Parkinsonism typically present at a younger age, sometimes with atypical features such as early dystonia. The decision to use dopamine agonists instead of L-dopa as first-line therapy is supported by clinical experience showing fewer L-dopa-induced motor complications. The improved motor control with a delayed introduction of L-dopa correlates with better quality of life and functional outcomes over time. Diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease is primarily clinical but may involve imaging (e.g., DAT-SPECT) to support the diagnosis in unclear cases. Differential diagnoses include atypical Parkinsonian disorders (MSA, PSP), drug-induced parkinsonism, and Wilson's disease in younger patients. Juvenile Parkinsonism is specifically considered when the onset is early and when the clinical course is consistent with early-onset idiopathic Parkinson's disease. First-line therapy in juvenile Parkinsonism favors dopamine agonists to delay L-dopa initiation. If symptoms are inadequately controlled or if side effects develop, a combination with low-dose L-dopa may be considered. In pregnant or lactating patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, treatment decisions require careful risk-benefit analysis. While the data are limited, many dopamine agonists are contraindicated or used with caution during pregnancy. Alternatives and dose adjustments may be necessary based on current obstetric guidelines and the patient's clinical condition. Option A: Juvenile Parkinsonism \u2013 Correct. Young patients benefit from dopamine agonists over L-dopa due to the lower risk of motor complications. The other options, which are not provided, do not apply or lack clinical evidence favoring dopamine agonist preferential use. 1. Young onset Parkinson's benefits from a dopamine agonist-first strategy to reduce long-term L-dopa adverse effects. 2. Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias are less common with dopamine agonists in early therapy. 3. Always consider age and long-term side effects in managing Parkinson\u2019s disease. Recent guidelines and meta-analyses continue to support the strategy of initiating treatment with dopamine agonists in younger patients, emphasizing a tailored approach based on age, symptom severity, and risk for motor complications.",
