    "explanation": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a critical condition characterized by bleeding into the subarachnoid space. However, not all SAHs are due to aneurysm rupture. Perimesencephalic SAH, a subset of nonaneurysmal SAH, has a distinct CT appearance and a markedly better prognosis. Perimesencephalic SAH is thought to result from a venous or small arterial bleed in the area surrounding the midbrain (the perimesencephalic cisterns). Unlike aneurysmal SAH, it is not associated with ruptured aneurysms and tends to confine to the perimesencephalic cisterns, with no evidence of blood in the sylvian fissures or other cisterns. Clinically, patients may present with a sudden severe headache, though the clinical course is typically benign compared to aneurysmal SAH. The typical CT finding is localized blood in the perimesencephalic region with no extension into other brain cisterns, which helps differentiate it from aneurysmal SAH. The initial diagnostic modality is a noncontrast head CT to detect subarachnoid blood. Once a perimesencephalic pattern is identified, it is standard to perform vascular imaging (CTA or digital subtraction angiography) to rule out an aneurysm. Differential diagnoses include aneurysmal SAH (which typically shows a more diffuse blood distribution) and other causes of intracranial hemorrhage. The management is largely supportive, including blood pressure control, pain management, and sometimes the use of nimodipine to help prevent vasospasm, though vasospasm is less common in perimesencephalic SAH. In pregnant or lactating women, supportive care is similarly applied, with careful selection of medications to minimize fetal or neonatal risk. Option A ('Perimesencephalic hemorrhage SAH') is the correct answer when the CT scan shows a blood distribution centered around the midbrain with sparing of other cisterns. Other potential options (if provided) might have included aneurysmal SAH or other hemorrhagic patterns, which are excluded by the localized pattern seen here. 1. Perimesencephalic SAH carries a much lower risk of complications and rebleeding than aneurysmal SAH. 2. The typical CT distribution is key for an accurate diagnosis. 3. Confirmatory vascular imaging is still important to definitively exclude aneurysms. Recent studies and guidelines support the conservative management of perimesencephalic SAH due to its benign natural history. The avoidance of aggressive interventions unless imaging reveals aneurysmal origins has been reinforced by current research.",

    "explanation": "Brain MRI is an essential tool for evaluating the mechanism of ischemic events. One common mechanism depicted on MRI is cerebral ischemia due to hemodynamic compromise, often seen in watershed regions between major cerebral arteries. Severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis is a well-known cause of such hemodynamic failure. ICA stenosis, usually from atherosclerotic disease, leads to reduced cerebral perfusion. This can result in watershed or borderzone infarcts\u2014ischemic lesions that occur between the territories of the major cerebral arteries. The MRI will typically show infarcts in these borderzone areas, supporting the mechanism of hypoperfusion rather than embolism or small vessel occlusion. Patients with significant ICA stenosis may experience transient ischemic attacks or full-blown strokes, often with deficits corresponding to the affected vascular territories. The ischemic changes on MRI, particularly in watershed zones, are indicative of a hemodynamic mechanism linked to severe carotid narrowing. Diagnosis is confirmed through vascular imaging modalities like carotid Doppler ultrasound, CTA, or MRA, which assess the degree of ICA stenosis. Differential diagnoses include embolic stroke (from cardiac sources) or small vessel disease, but the watershed distribution and vascular studies help differentiate ICA stenosis-related ischemia from these conditions. The first-line management of symptomatic ICA stenosis involves aggressive medical management\u2014including antiplatelet therapy, statins, and risk factor modification (control of hypertension, smoking cessation). In cases of severe stenosis in symptomatic patients, revascularization via carotid endarterectomy or stenting is recommended. In pregnant patients, the risks of interventional procedures must be balanced with medical therapy, using medications that are safe in pregnancy (e.g., certain antiplatelets and statins may be contraindicated, so tailored management is necessary). Lactating women are managed similarly, with careful consideration of drug safety. Option A ('ICA stenosis') is correct if the MRI shows infarct patterns typical of a watershed distribution. Other mechanisms might include cardioembolism or small vessel disease, but these are less consistent with the described MRI pattern. Thus, ICA stenosis is the most plausible explanation given the information. 1. Watershed infarcts on MRI are a red flag for hemodynamic compromise due to carotid stenosis. 2. Vascular imaging is essential in determining the degree of stenosis. 3. Management is a combination of medical therapy and possible revascularization in symptomatic severe cases. Recent trials continue to support the role of carotid revascularization in select symptomatic patients with high-grade stenosis, while emphasizing aggressive medical management in most cases. Guidelines stress individualized therapy based on imaging findings and clinical presentation.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Cardioembolic strokes are a distinct subtype of ischemic stroke, where the source of embolization is cardiac in origin. In patients with cardiac wall motion abnormalities (often described as ventricular hypokinesia), blood stasis can lead to thrombus formation, which may subsequently embolize to cerebral arteries. Areas of ventricular hypokinesia, frequently due to previous myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy, create conditions for blood stasis. This stasis predisposes to the formation of an intraventricular thrombus, which can dislodge and travel to the brain, causing an ischemic stroke. The management involves anticoagulation to prevent further thrombus formation and embolization. Patients with a history of cardiac dysfunction and evidence of wall motion abnormalities (as seen on echocardiography) who develop an ischemic stroke are typically suspected of having a cardioembolic mechanism. This guides the clinician toward the use of anticoagulant therapy rather than solely antiplatelet agents. Echocardiography is the main diagnostic tool for identifying left ventricular thrombi and assessing wall motion. Differential diagnoses include atherosclerotic stroke or small vessel (lacunar) stroke, but the presence of an echocardiographic abnormality points to a cardioembolic source. Additional workup might include cardiac MRI or contrast studies for further delineation. The primary treatment for cardioembolic stroke due to a ventricular thrombus is systemic anticoagulation. Warfarin has been the traditional first-line therapy with a target INR typically between 2 and 3, and is supported by a body of evidence in preventing recurrent embolic events. Although non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are preferred in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, their use in patients with left ventricular thrombus is off\u2013label and not yet supported by robust evidence. Antiplatelet therapies like aspirin or clopidogrel are not sufficient in this setting. In the context of pregnancy, warfarin is contraindicated due to its teratogenicity; low molecular weight heparin is the preferred anticoagulant. In lactating women, warfarin is generally safe, though careful monitoring is still warranted. Option A ('Warfarin') is the correct treatment choice for a cardioembolic stroke in the setting of ventricular hypokinesia. NOACs (Option B) do not have established evidence in this specific scenario. Options C and D (aspirin and clopidogrel) are antiplatelet agents and do not provide adequate protection against thrombus formation from a low-flow cardiac source. 1. Cardioembolic strokes require anticoagulation rather than mere antiplatelet therapy. 2. Warfarin remains the gold standard for treating left ventricular thrombus despite emerging interest in NOACs. 3. In pregnant patients, warfarin is contraindicated\u2014LMWH should be used instead. Recent guidelines reaffirm the role of warfarin for patients with left ventricular thrombus and cardioembolic stroke. While newer agents are under investigation, current large-scale studies and clinical practice continue to support warfarin as first\u2013line therapy in this setting, with adjustments made for special populations like pregnant women.",

    "explanation": "CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary small vessel disease. The condition typically presents with migraine (often with aura), recurrent subcortical ischemic events, and progressive cognitive decline. The definitive diagnosis relies on identifying the pathogenic mutation in the NOTCH3 gene. Mutations in the NOTCH3 gene lead to abnormal protein accumulation in the smooth muscle cells of small arteries. This results in degeneration of the vascular smooth muscle with the accumulation of granular osmiophilic deposits (GOM) and subsequent compromise in blood flow. These changes produce the characteristic white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts seen on imaging. Patients typically present with migraine with aura, mood disturbances, and eventual cognitive impairment. The cerebrovascular insufficiency due to microangiopathy manifests as lacunar strokes, which are central to the clinical presentation of CADASIL. The most specific diagnostic test is genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations. Supportive findings include MRI features such as white matter hyperintensities (especially in the anterior temporal lobes), but these are not definitive. Skin biopsy can show GOM deposits but has less sensitivity and specificity, and is reserved for equivocal cases. Differential diagnoses include other causes of small vessel disease such as sporadic lacunar stroke, multiple sclerosis, and other hereditary leukoencephalopathies. There is no cure for CADASIL; treatment is supportive and aims to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Migraine is managed symptomatically, while vascular risk factor modification (e.g., controlling blood pressure, avoiding smoking) is crucial. Genetic counseling is important for affected families. In pregnancy and lactation, careful coordination is necessary to manage migraines and vascular risk factors with medications that are safe for the fetus or infant. Option B (genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations) is correct because it is the definitive diagnostic modality. Option A (skin biopsy) is only supportive and is less sensitive and specific. Option C (MRI alone) reveals characteristic but nonspecific findings that overlap with other small vessel pathologies. Option D (CSF analysis) and Option E (routine blood tests) are non-diagnostic in CADASIL. 1. NOTCH3 gene mutation testing is the gold standard for diagnosing CADASIL. 2. MRI commonly shows white matter hyperintensities with a predilection for the anterior temporal lobes. 3. Skin biopsy can be used when genetic testing is inconclusive but is not first-line. Recent guidelines reaffirm the importance of genetic testing for CADASIL given its specificity. Advances in imaging have helped in raising suspicion, but the definitive diagnosis continues to rely on molecular methods. Research continues into targeted therapies and better risk factor management although treatment remains largely supportive.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Acute neurologic events such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the context of severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis require prompt evaluation to prevent a full-blown stroke. Symptomatic high-grade ICA stenosis has been shown to benefit significantly from surgical intervention. Atherosclerotic plaque buildup in the ICA can lead to severe stenosis, which predisposes to embolic events. In symptomatic patients, the unstable plaque can cause TIAs or strokes due to embolization or hemodynamic compromise. Patients with severe, symptomatic ICA stenosis may have transient focal neurological deficits corresponding to the affected vascular territory. The presence of TIA in this setting is a warning sign for an impending stroke. Initial evaluation includes carotid duplex ultrasonography to determine the degree of stenosis, followed by confirmatory imaging such as CT angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Differential diagnoses include intracranial atherosclerosis, cardioembolic stroke, and small vessel disease, which can be differentiated based on imaging and clinical findings. For patients with symptomatic severe ICA stenosis, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the first-line treatment as recommended by current guidelines (e.g., American Heart Association/American Stroke Association). Carotid angioplasty plus stenting (CAS) is generally reserved for patients who are poor surgical candidates or have specific anatomical considerations. In pregnancy, intervention requires multidisciplinary coordination, as both surgery and stenting carry risks; management should minimize exposure to radiation and contrast, and timing of intervention may be modified until postpartum if feasible. Option A (angioplasty plus stenting) is a less favored first-line therapy in typical cases unless the patient is a high surgical risk. Option B (male 50 shunting) appears to be irrelevant and not supported by guidelines. Option C (endarterectomy) is the guideline-supported intervention for symptomatic severe ICA stenosis and is therefore correct. 1. Carotid endarterectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis >70%. 2. Careful patient selection is essential when considering surgical versus endovascular approaches. 3. Noninvasive imaging (duplex ultrasound, CTA, MRA) plays a critical role in evaluation. Recent updates in vascular stroke guidelines continue to support the use of CEA in symptomatic patients with high-grade stenosis. Endovascular approaches remain secondary options for those deemed high risk for surgery, and ongoing trials are comparing long-term outcomes between surgical and stenting approaches.",

    "explanation": "Weber's syndrome is a classic brainstem stroke syndrome that involves the midbrain. It is characterized by an ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy and contralateral hemiparesis, making localization of the lesion to the midbrain crucial. A lesion at the level of the midbrain basis (specifically in the cerebral peduncle region) can compromise both the oculomotor nerve fibers and the corticospinal tracts. Infarctions in this area typically result from occlusion of perforating branches of the posterior cerebral or superior cerebellar arteries. Clinically, patients present with a combination of ipsilateral ptosis, pupil dilation, and eye movement deficits along with contralateral weakness/hemiparesis. This pattern allows for precise neuroanatomic localization, linking clinical findings to a lesion in the midbrain. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical examination supported by neuroimaging (MRI) which can confirm an infarct in the midbrain. Differential diagnoses include other brainstem syndromes (e.g., Benedikt's syndrome, Claude's syndrome) which have differing clinical features depending on the exact anatomic involvement. Management is generally supportive and follows standard ischemic stroke protocols including antiplatelet therapy, management of risk factors, and rehabilitation. In the setting of acute stroke, thrombolytic therapy may be considered if the patient meets criteria. In pregnancy and lactation, the choice of thrombolytic agents and supportive medications should be made with fetal/infant safety in mind. Option A (midbrain basis) is correct because Weber's syndrome is caused by infarction or a lesion in the ventral midbrain. Other choices, if provided, would likely refer to non-matching locations (e.g., pons, thalamus) and are therefore incorrect. 1. Weber's syndrome is a midbrain stroke characterized by ipsilateral third nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis. 2. The lesion is located in the ventral midbrain (basis pedunculi). 3. Differential diagnosis should include other midbrain syndromes which may have overlapping yet distinct features. Current neuroimaging modalities, especially high-resolution MRI, continue to assist in the rapid localization and confirmation of brainstem strokes linked to syndromes like Weber's. Updated stroke guidelines underscore the importance of swift diagnosis and management.",

    "explanation": "In the setting of acute ischemic stroke, elevated blood pressure is common and is part of the body\u2019s physiological response to maintain cerebral perfusion. Management of blood pressure is nuanced and depends on whether the patient is eligible for reperfusion therapies. After an ischemic stroke, autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is impaired, and permissive hypertension helps support penumbral tissue. Aggressive blood pressure reduction can potentially worsen ischemia in the affected areas. A patient who presents with an acute ischemic stroke and a blood pressure of 193/103 mm Hg falls within the range tolerated in patients not eligible for thrombolytic therapy. If the patient is not undergoing reperfusion treatment, the elevated blood pressure is typically not immediately lowered unless it exceeds thresholds (commonly 220/120 mm Hg). Blood pressure management in stroke is guided by clinical criteria and imaging findings. Differential considerations include hemorrhagic stroke (where blood pressure control is more aggressive) versus ischemic stroke. In ischemic stroke, neuroimaging (CT/MRI) distinguishes between these conditions and directs management. For ischemic stroke patients not receiving thrombolytic therapy, current guidelines recommend tolerating higher blood pressures (up to 220/120 mm Hg)\u2014this is known as permissive hypertension. If the patient were eligible for IV tPA, blood pressure would need to be lowered to below 185/110 mm Hg using agents like IV labetalol before therapy. In pregnancy, blood pressure management must consider maternal and fetal safety, with agents like labetalol and hydralazine often preferred; however, if the stroke is not treated with thrombolysis, similar permissive limits may apply under close monitoring. Option A (IV labetalol) would be indicated if the patient were a candidate for thrombolysis, as the blood pressure would need to be reduced to a safe level (<185/110 mm Hg). Option B (IV nitroprusside) is not typically used in acute ischemic stroke due to its potent and unpredictable effects on cerebral blood flow. Option C (Observation) is correct in a scenario where the patient is not receiving reperfusion therapy because the blood pressure is within the acceptable range for permissive hypertension. Option D (Resume home medications) is nonspecific and does not directly address the acute management of blood pressure in a stroke setting. 1. Permissive hypertension (up to 220/120 mm Hg) is generally allowed in acute ischemic stroke patients who are not candidates for reperfusion therapy. 2. For patients eligible for IV tPA, blood pressure must be carefully lowered to below 185/110 mm Hg before administration. 3. Monitoring and gradual reduction, when indicated, minimize the risk of compromising cerebral perfusion. Recent guidelines continue to support a conservative approach to blood pressure management in acute ischemic stroke for non-thrombolysis candidates. There is ongoing research into optimal blood pressure targets during the hyperacute phase of stroke, balancing the risks of recurrent ischemia against the potential harms of aggressive blood pressure lowering.",

    "explanation": "This question asks you to identify an arteriopathy on cerebral angiography in a patient with recurrent headaches and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). In such cases, several vascular conditions (e.g., atherosclerosis, dissection, vasculitis, fibromuscular dysplasia, and Moyamoya disease) are considered; the key lies in recognizing characteristic imaging patterns. Moyamoya disease is characterized by progressive stenosis of the distal internal carotid arteries and their proximal branches. In response to the reduced blood flow, a network of transdural collateral vessels develops. On angiography, these collaterals appear as a hazy \u201cpuff\u2010of\u2010smoke\u201d pattern. This abnormal vasculature predisposes patients to recurrent TIAs and strokes, and headache is a common accompanying symptom. Patients may present with recurrent transient neurological deficits (TIAs) and headaches. Although Moyamoya is classically described in children, it also occurs in young to middle\u2010aged adults and may have variable presentations including ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Cerebral angiography remains the gold standard. Differential diagnoses include: \u2022 Large artery atherosclerosis (typically seen in older patients with classic risk factors) \u2022 Arterial dissection (often with an intimal flap or double lumen appearance) \u2022 Vasculitis (with segmental narrowing and beading, often accompanied by systemic signs) \u2022 Fibromuscular dysplasia (showing a \u201cstring\u2010of\u2010beads\u201d pattern). The pattern of progressive stenosis with the development of a network of abnormal collateral vessels helps differentiate Moyamoya. The first\u2010line management for symptomatic Moyamoya disease is surgical revascularization (either direct, such as superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass, or indirect techniques). Medical management (including antiplatelet agents) is mainly supportive. In pregnant or lactating women, the decision for surgical intervention is individualized, with careful coordination between neurosurgery, obstetrics, and neurology to minimize fetal radiation exposure and optimize maternal outcomes. Although the exact options are not provided, the differential includes several entities. Option B (assumed to be Moyamoya disease) is correct if the angiography reveals progressive stenosis of the terminal internal carotid arteries with prominent collateral vessels. Other options can be excluded as follows: \u2022 Atherosclerosis typically shows focal stenosis in older individuals. \u2022 Arterial dissection would present acutely with a tear, often along the cervical vessels. \u2022 Vasculitis tends to have systemic inflammatory markers and multifocal segmental narrowing. \u2022 Fibromuscular dysplasia classically displays a 'string\u2010of\u2010beads' pattern rather than the \u201cpuff\u2010of\u2010smoke\u201d appearance. \u2022 Moyamoya means 'puff\u2010of\u2010smoke' in Japanese \u2013 a reference to its characteristic angiographic appearance. \u2022 Recurrent TIAs and headaches in a younger patient should prompt consideration of Moyamoya, especially when imaging shows extensive collateralization. \u2022 Differentiating Moyamoya from other arteriopathies is crucial since surgical revascularization can significantly improve outcomes. Recent literature supports early surgical revascularization for symptomatic Moyamoya disease to reduce the risk of stroke. The updated guidelines emphasize the importance of high\u2010quality vascular imaging for diagnosis and advocate for a multidisciplinary approach to management, including considerations during pregnancy where imaging and surgical timing are carefully planned.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question deals with the management of acute ischemic stroke in an elderly patient who shows partial improvement early in the time window. The decision to administer intravenous thrombolysis (IV tPA) depends on the severity and functional impact of the residual deficits. Acute ischemic stroke results from an occlusion of a cerebral vessel leading to ischemia of the brain tissue. In some patients, spontaneous recanalization or the natural evolution of the thrombus can result in partial clinical improvement. However, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation with thrombolytic therapy remains, and the net benefit must be weighed based on the disability of the remaining deficits. An 82\u2010year-old patient may present with stroke symptoms that begin to improve spontaneously. The key consideration is whether the residual deficits are disabling. \u2018Rapid improvement\u2019 or minimal deficits might suggest that the risks of IV tPA (notably intracranial hemorrhage) may outweigh the benefits. A thorough neurological exam, often quantified by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), is used to determine the severity of stroke. Differential considerations include a transient ischemic attack (TIA) versus a minor stroke. Brain imaging (CT/MRI) is also used to rule out hemorrhage before considering IV tPA. For patients within 4.5 hours of onset with disabling deficits, IV tPA remains the first\u2010line treatment. However, in patients with mild or rapidly improving symptoms that are deemed non\u2010disabling, the benefit of IV tPA is less clear. In such cases, supportive care and observation may be preferred. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of IV tPA is considered when the benefits significantly outweigh the risks, with careful monitoring and adjustments to minimize potential adverse effects. \u2022 Option A (Give IV tPA) is the standard for acute ischemic strokes with significant, disabling deficits. However, in this scenario the patient shows partial improvement, suggesting that the deficit may now be minor or non\u2010disabling. \u2022 Option B (the marked answer) is assumed to represent conservative management (i.e., withholding IV tPA) when the residual deficit is not clinically disabling. Given the ambiguity in the clinical improvement, many clinicians choose not to expose patients to the risk of hemorrhage if the deficit is minimal. Thus, the marked answer is appropriate provided that the residual deficit is indeed non\u2010disabling. \u2022 Always assess the degree of residual disability \u2013 even if a patient shows some improvement, a significant functional impairment warrants thrombolysis. \u2022 There is no strict age cutoff for IV tPA; decisions should be based on the balance of risks and benefits. \u2022 \u2018Rapid improvement\u2019 does not automatically preclude treatment, but if the symptoms are minor and not disabling, observation may be appropriate. Recent studies have highlighted that patients with minor or rapidly improving symptoms often do well with conservative management, though it is recognized that a subset may deteriorate. Current guidelines recommend individualized assessment of disability rather than relying solely on the degree of improvement, with ongoing research into objective measures to guide thrombolytic use in this group.",

    "explanation": "This question focuses on the secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in a patient whose workup (via echocardiography) revealed an intracardiac thrombus. The prevention strategy in such settings is aimed at reducing further embolic events. An intracardiac thrombus, often formed in areas of regional akinesis or dyskinesis (such as post-myocardial infarction), can dislodge and embolize to the cerebral circulation, causing ischemic stroke. Anticoagulants decrease thrombin production and clot propagation, thereby reducing embolic risk. Patients with cardioembolic strokes typically present with sudden onset focal neurological deficits. Echocardiography is used to identify intracardiac sources of emboli. The discovery of a thrombus mandates anticoagulation to prevent recurrent embolization. Once a stroke is identified, workup includes brain imaging to identify the ischemic territory and cardiac imaging (transthoracic or transesophageal echo) to evaluate for intracardiac thrombi. Differential diagnoses include atherosclerotic stroke (where antiplatelet therapy is preferred) and paradoxical emboli (which may require further investigation for a patent foramen ovale). For secondary prevention in patients with a documented intracardiac thrombus, anticoagulation is the cornerstone. Warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) has been the traditional first-line agent, given its proven efficacy in preventing systemic embolization. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are used in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, but their use in patients with intracardiac thrombus has less robust evidence. In pregnant patients, warfarin is contraindicated, particularly in the first trimester due to fetal teratogenicity; low molecular weight heparin is preferred during pregnancy and lactation. \u2022 Option A (Warfarin) is correct because it effectively prevents thrombus propagation in patients with intracardiac thrombus. \u2022 Option B (NOACs) are currently less established for this specific indication despite their success in atrial fibrillation. \u2022 Options C (Aspirin) and D (Clopidogrel) are antiplatelet agents that do not adequately address the risk of thromboembolism from an intracardiac clot. \u2022 Always evaluate for an intracardiac source in stroke patients when indicated, as management differs significantly from atherosclerotic stroke. \u2022 Warfarin remains the first-line anticoagulant for confirmed intracardiac thrombus unless contraindicated. \u2022 In women of childbearing age or those who are pregnant/lactating, consider alternative anticoagulation strategies. Recent guidelines reaffirm the role of warfarin for patients with intracardiac thrombus. Although NOACs have become popular for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, their role in intracardiac thrombus is less clear, and ongoing trials seek to clarify their safety and efficacy in this indication.",

    "explanation": "In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the risk of ischemic stroke is significantly elevated due to abnormal red blood cell morphology causing vaso-occlusion and endothelial damage. Secondary prevention strategies focus on reducing the proportion of sickled cells to prevent further vascular occlusion. Sickle cells have altered rheological properties and can occlude small cerebral vessels. Chronic transfusion therapy dilutes the concentration of hemoglobin S (HbS) in the circulation, thereby decreasing the likelihood of sickling and subsequent vaso-occlusion. This reduction in HbS minimizes endothelial injury and reduces the risk of recurrent stroke. Patients with SCD who have already suffered an ischemic stroke are at high risk for recurrence. Clinical management involves aggressive intervention to lower HbS levels. Chronic blood transfusions have been shown to reduce this risk effectively. Workup includes brain imaging to confirm ischemia along with laboratory evaluation of hemoglobin electrophoresis. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound may also be used for screening in children with SCD to assess stroke risk. For secondary stroke prevention in SCD, chronic red blood cell transfusion is considered the first-line therapy (as recommended by the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines). The goal is to maintain HbS levels below 30% to minimize the risk of further vaso-occlusive events. Hydroxyurea is another therapy that can reduce sickling and is often used in conjunction with supportive measures. In pregnant or lactating patients with SCD, transfusion protocols require careful coordination to avoid alloimmunization and iron overload, and multidisciplinary care is essential. \u2022 Option A (Chronic blood transfusion) is the recommended strategy for secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD. \u2022 Other options (though not detailed here) such as antiplatelet agents are less effective in modifying the underlying sickling process. \u2022 In SCD, prevention of stroke centers on reducing the hemoglobin S percentage \u2013 keeping it below 30% is crucial. \u2022 Regular transfusions, while effective, necessitate monitoring for iron overload and may require chelation therapy. \u2022 Multidisciplinary management is key, especially in patients who are pregnant or lactating. The latest AHA/ASA guidelines (2021) strongly advocate for chronic transfusion therapy for secondary stroke prevention in SCD patients. Emerging research is also evaluating the role of gene therapy and other novel agents, but transfusion remains the standard of care at present.",

    "option_c": "Deep venous drain",
    "option_d": "Presence of aneurysm",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital vascular anomalies composed of a tangle of abnormal vessels with direct arteriovenous shunting. One of the key clinical concerns in AVMs is the risk of hemorrhage. A previous history of bleeding is recognized as an important predictor for future hemorrhagic events because it suggests vessel wall instability. AVMs have an abnormal architecture lacking the normal capillary bed, leading to high-flow, high-pressure shunts. A prior hemorrhage indicates that the fragile, dysplastic vessels have already ruptured once, thereby increasing the likelihood of rebleeding. The hemodynamic stress and turbulent flow further predispose to weakening and rupture of adjacent vessel segments. This concept is supported by studies showing that prior hemorrhage is the strongest predictor for subsequent bleeding. Clinically, patients with a history of AVM-related hemorrhage are at heightened risk for rebleeding, which may result in sudden neurological deterioration, headache, or focal deficits. Recognition of this risk emphasizes the need for close monitoring and often an aggressive therapeutic approach. The diagnosis and risk stratification of AVMs involve neuroimaging. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard, though CT/MR angiography can provide valuable information regarding the nidus, venous drainage, and any associated aneurysms. Differential diagnoses include cavernous malformations (which typically present with smaller, \u2018popcorn-like\u2019 lesions and less aggressive hemorrhagic risk) and capillary telangiectasias. The management of AVMs with a history of hemorrhage is challenging. First-line options include microsurgical resection, endovascular embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery, often used in combination. Decision making is based on AVM location, size, venous drainage, and patient-specific factors. In pregnancy or lactation, noninvasive modalities and careful consideration of radiation exposure are paramount, with embolization using newer materials sometimes preferred if intervention is urgent. Multidisciplinary discussion is essential in these scenarios. Option A (Previous history of bleeding) is correct because a prior hemorrhage is the most consistent predictor for subsequent AVM rupture. Option B (Deep AVM) and Option C (Deep venous drainage) are also associated with higher hemorrhagic risk but are not as strongly predictive as a history of bleeding. Option D (Presence of aneurysm) is a recognized risk factor, particularly with intranidal aneurysms, and Option E (Highest grade with size) can be associated with increased risk, but the literature most strongly supports previous hemorrhage as the most significant risk factor. \u2022 A prior hemorrhagic event in AVM patients greatly increases the risk of rebleeding. \u2022 Deep location and deep venous drainage also elevate hemorrhage risk. \u2022 Multimodality imaging is crucial for risk stratification and management planning. Recent studies and guideline updates continue to support previous hemorrhage as a key risk factor for AVM bleeding. Research is ongoing into the molecular and hemodynamic factors that predispose certain AVMs to rebleed, and treatment algorithms are increasingly tailored to individual hemorrhagic risk profiles, especially when managing high-risk lesions in special populations such as pregnant or lactating patients.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is one of several autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. Unlike many other SCAs, SCA7 uniquely presents with visual impairment due to retinal degeneration, often accompanied by optic atrophy and sometimes hearing loss, which is a result of widespread neurodegeneration. SCA7 is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene leading to an abnormally long polyglutamine tract within the ataxin-7 protein. This abnormal protein misfolds and aggregates, causing neuronal dysfunction and cell death particularly in the cerebellum, brainstem, and retina. The degeneration of retinal photoreceptors leads to pigmentary retinopathy and subsequent optic nerve atrophy. Patients with SCA7 typically present with progressive cerebellar ataxia along with visual impairment, which may initially manifest as blurry vision or difficulty with central vision, eventually leading to optic atrophy. Hearing loss can also occur as a less common but noted feature. A positive family history supports the diagnosis of an autosomal dominant disorder. The diagnosis is established by clinical examination, family history, and confirmation via genetic testing for the ATXN7 gene repeat expansion. Differential diagnoses include SCA6, which generally presents with a more pure cerebellar ataxia without significant retinal involvement, and Friedreich ataxia (which is autosomal recessive and more commonly features cardiomyopathy and peripheral neuropathy rather than optic atrophy). There is currently no cure for SCA7; management is supportive and focuses on symptom relief and rehabilitation. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy are key components of care. Genetic counseling is essential for affected families. In pregnant or lactating patients, special care should be taken regarding medications that may exacerbate neurological symptoms, and genetic counseling is crucial in family planning. Option A (SCA 7) is correct as it best fits the clinical picture of progressive ataxia combined with optic atrophy and hearing loss. Option B (SCA 6) is primarily associated with cerebellar ataxia without significant retinal or optic pathway involvement. Option C (Friedreich ataxia) typically presents earlier in life with ataxia, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes, and follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The blank Option D provides no diagnostic value. \u2022 Visual impairment (often from retinal degeneration) is a hallmark of SCA7. \u2022 A positive family history with autosomal dominant inheritance should prompt consideration of SCA7. \u2022 Genetic testing is definitive in distinguishing between different SCAs. Recent advances in molecular genetics have improved early diagnosis of SCA7. Although no disease-modifying therapies currently exist, ongoing research into polyglutamine disorders holds promise for targeted therapies. Updated guidelines stress the importance of multidisciplinary management and genetic counseling, particularly for women in their childbearing years.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder characterized by the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), leading to progressive demyelination of the white matter and adrenal insufficiency. It is typically inherited in an X-linked manner, which explains its prevalence in young males and its occurrence among affected brothers. The defect in ALD lies in the ABCD1 gene, which impairs the transport of VLCFAs into peroxisomes for beta-oxidation. The resultant accumulation of these fatty acids disrupts membrane integrity and causes inflammatory demyelination in the central nervous system. The adrenal cortex is similarly affected, leading to adrenal insufficiency in many patients. Young males with ALD often present with behavioral changes, cognitive decline (early dementia), and motor dysfunction such as spastic paraparesis (which may manifest as bilateral lower limb weakness). MRI typically reveals diffuse, often parieto-occipital, white matter lesions. A family history positive for similar neurological impairment heightens the suspicion of ALD. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, neuroimaging (with MRI showing symmetric white matter changes), and biochemical assays showing elevated VLCFA levels, followed by genetic testing for confirmation. Differential diagnoses include hereditary spastic paraplegia (which typically lacks significant white matter changes and cognitive decline), Krabbe disease (which presents in infancy), and Tangier disease (which has distinct lipid abnormalities and lacks the neurological pattern seen in ALD). The management of ALD includes hormone replacement for adrenal insufficiency and consideration of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in early cerebral disease to slow progression of demyelination. Emerging gene therapies are under investigation. In pregnant patients, counseling and careful endocrine management are critical, while lactation requires attention to the safety of any medications used (for instance, continuing hydrocortisone replacement as indicated). Option A (Adrenoleukodystrophy) is correct because the clinical picture of early dementia, bilateral lower limb weakness, diffuse white matter lesions on MRI, and a positive family history in a young male strongly fits ALD. Option B (Hereditary spastic paraplegia) usually lacks the white matter changes and cognitive decline. Option C (Krabbe disease) typically presents in infancy with rapid neurodegeneration, and Option D (Tangier disease) is primarily a lipid metabolism disorder without the described neuroimaging findings. \u2022 ALD is an X-linked peroxisomal disorder that primarily affects young males. \u2022 Elevated VLCFA levels are key to the diagnosis. \u2022 Early intervention with HSCT may slow cerebral progression if undertaken before significant neurological decline. Recent studies emphasize the importance of early detection via newborn screening programs and the potential role of emerging gene therapies and HSCT. Current guidelines outline a multidisciplinary approach for managing neurologic and endocrine aspects of ALD, with special considerations for counseling women at risk during pregnancy.",

    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Arterial dissection involves a tear in the intimal layer of the vessel wall. This creates a false lumen where blood can accumulate, leading to an intramural hematoma. The process can result in luminal narrowing and the formation of thrombi, which may subsequently embolize. In dissection, an intimal tear allows blood to enter the arterial wall, dissecting between layers. This results in an intramural hematoma that can compress the true lumen and cause cerebral ischemia either via hemodynamic insufficiency or, more commonly, through thrombus formation at the site of the tear. Pieces of the thrombus can break off and embolize distally, causing an ischemic stroke. Patients with arterial dissection often present with acute pain (such as neck or head pain) followed by focal neurological deficits due to cerebral ischemia. The embolic mechanism explains the frequently observed multifocal ischemic lesions on imaging. Recognizing the mechanism helps tailor management toward preventing further embolic events. Noninvasive imaging, including CT angiography and MR angiography, is key in diagnosing arterial dissection by visualizing the double lumen or an intramural hematoma. Differential diagnoses include atherosclerotic stroke, vasculitis, and cardioembolic stroke. Distinguishing features on imaging, such as the elongated dissection flap or tapered occlusion, aid in differentiation. Initial management of arterial dissection is medical, focusing on antithrombotic therapy to prevent thromboembolism. Current guidelines suggest using either antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents with no clear superiority of one over the other in many cases. Endovascular intervention may be considered in patients with persistent symptoms or worsening dissection. In pregnant patients, low-molecular-weight heparin is often preferred over vitamin K antagonists due to safety profiles, and therapy should be closely coordinated with obstetric care. Lactating mothers can typically use antiplatelet agents safely, but the choice of medication should be individualized. Although the specific options are not provided, the marked answer (Option B) is assumed to represent the mechanism of stroke via thrombus formation and subsequent embolization from the dissection site. This is the accepted pathophysiological mechanism in most cases of cervical artery dissection. Other potential answers may have described hemodynamic compromise or direct occlusion, but evidence favors an embolic mechanism as the predominant cause of ischemic stroke in dissection. \u2022 Arterial dissection is a common cause of stroke in young patients and often presents with pain followed by neurological deficits. \u2022 The primary mechanism involves thrombus formation in a false lumen with subsequent embolization. \u2022 Early diagnosis with vascular imaging is crucial in guiding appropriate antithrombotic therapy. Recent randomized studies have shown similar outcomes between antiplatelet and anticoagulant strategies for cervical artery dissections. Current guidelines emphasize individualized therapy and highlight safety considerations for special populations such as pregnant and lactating women, recommending agents with favorable risk profiles and minimal fetal/neonatal exposure.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Embolic strokes occur when a clot formed elsewhere, most commonly in the heart, dislodges and travels to the cerebral circulation. When routine etiological work\u2010up (e.g., basic transthoracic echocardiography, carotid ultrasound) is unremarkable, the stroke remains cryptogenic or classified as an Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS). In many cryptogenic strokes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is suspected even though it can be missed on a standard workup. Clots form in the left atrium or appendage due to stasis, and intermittent arrhythmia leads to embolization. Up\u2010to\u2010date evidence, including studies such as the CRYSTAL\u2010AF trial, supports that prolonged cardiac monitoring increases detection of intermittent arrhythmias as the inciting cause. Patients with embolic strokes typically present with sudden focal neurological deficits. In cases where the conventional workup proves negative, the clinical suspicion for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation remains high, and this may be the hidden source of embolism. After initial neuroimaging (CT/MRI) and cardiac evaluation with TTE/TEE have ruled out obvious sources, the next diagnostic step is long-term cardiac monitoring. Differential diagnoses include other embolic sources (e.g., aortic arch atheroma), small vessel lacunar strokes, or non-embolic etiologies; however, the multifocal embolic pattern generally steers workup toward paroxysmal arrhythmias. First-line management after a negative routine workup is to utilize prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring (e.g., a 30-day event monitor or even an implantable loop recorder if indicated) to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. If AF is detected, long-term anticoagulation is recommended. In pregnant or lactating patients, if anticoagulation becomes necessary, unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred due to their safety profiles during pregnancy and lactation. Although the specific answer choices aren\u2019t provided, answer option B is assumed to represent the choice of extended cardiac monitoring. This is the correct next step after a negative initial evaluation in a patient with an embolic stroke pattern. 1. Cryptogenic strokes account for a significant proportion of embolic strokes where routine testing is negative. 2. Prolonged cardiac monitoring increases the diagnostic yield for detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 3. Once AF is documented, the management pivots to anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy. Recent trials like CRYSTAL\u2010AF and EMBRACE have solidified the role of prolonged cardiac monitoring in detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke, influencing recent guideline recommendations from the American Stroke Association.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "When imaging demonstrates strokes in both the anterior and posterior circulation bilaterally, a cardioembolic source is highly suspected. Even if initial cardiac studies (TTE and TEE) are negative, intermittent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may still be the underlying cause. The mechanism behind such multi-territorial strokes is most often embolic in nature. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be elusive because its episodes may be transient. Negative echocardiographic studies do not rule out arrhythmogenic causes, hence the importance of prolonged rhythm monitoring. Patients with multi-territorial infarctions can present with a combination of neurological deficits affecting different regions. The finding of strokes in multiple vascular territories strongly suggests an embolic source even in the absence of structural abnormalities on TTE/TEE. After ruling out major cardiac sources with TTE and TEE, it is important to pursue extended monitoring, such as with Holter monitors or implantable loop recorders, to detect intermittent arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation. Differential considerations include aortic arch atheroma, hypercoagulable states, or less common embolic sources, but the clinical pattern directs the workup toward paroxysmal AF. In light of a negative TTE/TEE and a high clinical suspicion for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the first-line management is prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring. If atrial fibrillation is subsequently detected, then the patient should be managed with anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy. In pregnant or lactating patients, LMWH is currently preferred for anticoagulation due to its safety profile. Option B, which is presumed to represent the strategy of prolonged or extended cardiac monitoring, is correct. It targets the possibility of intermittent atrial fibrillation that may have been missed on initial examinations. 1. Bilateral and multi-territorial strokes strongly raise the suspicion of a cardioembolic source. 2. Negative initial echocardiograms do not exclude paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 3. Prolonged cardiac monitoring can reveal intermittent arrhythmias that guide appropriate anticoagulation therapy. Recent studies and guideline updates emphasize the diagnostic utility of prolonged cardiac monitoring (e.g., via the EMBRACE or CRYSTAL-AF trials) in evaluating patients with ESUS, reinforcing this strategy in clinical practice.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Progressive myelopathy refers to a slowly worsening dysfunction of the spinal cord. In older adults, one of the most common causes is degenerative changes in the cervical spine, commonly known as cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is caused by chronic degenerative changes such as disc herniation, osteophyte formation, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and sometimes ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. These changes lead to narrowing of the spinal canal (stenosis) and subsequent compression of the spinal cord. Patients typically present with gradual onset of motor weakness, gait instability, sensory disturbances, and in some cases, hyperreflexia. The progression is usually insidious, reflecting the slow nature of degenerative changes in the cervical spine. Diagnosis is established with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, which reveals features such as spinal canal narrowing and intramedullary hyperintensities indicative of cord compression. Differential diagnoses include demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis), intramedullary tumors, infectious processes (e.g., spinal epidural abscess), and inflammatory conditions. Correlation with clinical findings is essential. The first-line management often involves conservative treatment (physical therapy, pain management, and careful monitoring) in mild cases. However, in individuals with progressive neurological deficits, surgical decompression (e.g., anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or laminectomy) is recommended. For pregnant or lactating patients, the treatment approach must carefully weigh the risks and benefits; conservative management is preferred if the deficits are not severe, but if surgery is necessary, timing and anesthetic considerations become critical. Assuming option B corresponds to 'cervical spondylotic myelopathy', this is the correct choice based on the clinical picture and typical MRI findings associated with the condition. 1. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a common cause of progressive spinal cord compression in elderly patients. 2. MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice to evaluate for cord compression. 3. Early surgical intervention in progressive cases can improve neurological outcomes. Recent guidelines suggest that early surgical decompression in patients with moderate to severe deficits can lead to improved long-term outcomes. Ongoing research continues to refine the indications and timing for surgery based on imaging and clinical severity.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Acute ischemic stroke treatment often includes intravenous thrombolysis (tPA) and, when indicated, endovascular thrombectomy. However, post-treatment complications must be vigilantly monitored. tPA increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation, especially in the setting of large infarct volumes or uncontrolled hypertension. A sudden deterioration, such as vomiting and lethargy, may signal an intracranial hemorrhage or increased intracranial pressure secondary to bleeding, particularly if blood pressure rises to levels like 180/110 mm Hg. In this scenario, the patient initially had a favorable CT (ASPECTS 8) and was being managed with tPA while being evaluated for thrombectomy. The subsequent acute neurological deterioration (vomiting, lethargy) in the context of elevated blood pressure is highly concerning for a hemorrhagic complication or neurologic worsening, warranting immediate re-evaluation. The first step in managing sudden neurological decline after thrombolysis is to rapidly re-image the brain using non-contrast CT to assess for hemorrhagic transformation. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct, malignant cerebral edema, or even an unrelated complication. Immediate imaging helps differentiate these conditions. According to current stroke guidelines, the initial management for any suspected hemorrhagic complication post tPA is to obtain emergent neuroimaging to confirm the diagnosis. Blood pressure management is also critical; while strict BP control (generally <185/110 mm Hg pre-tPA) is maintained during and after thrombolysis, any new neurological changes necessitate re-imaging before further interventions. In pregnant or lactating patients, imaging protocols remain the same, and care should be taken in selecting antihypertensive agents that are safe in these populations (e.g., labetalol or hydralazine). Option C, which directs the clinician to send the patient for an immediate CT scan, is the appropriate response. Options such as just decreasing blood pressure or stopping tPA are premature without confirming hemorrhage via re-imaging. The CT scan is needed to determine the correct next steps. 1. Any sudden neurological change during or after thrombolytic therapy should prompt immediate re-imaging. 2. Elevated blood pressure post-tPA, especially in the setting of neurological deterioration, raises concern for hemorrhage. 3. Adhering to BP thresholds during thrombolytic therapy is crucial to minimize hemorrhagic risk. Current guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association continue to stress the importance of urgent non-contrast head CT in the assessment of suspected hemorrhagic complications after tPA administration. Recent studies emphasize the predictive value of re-imaging when patients show clinical deterioration.",

    "explanation": "This case describes a hypertensive female presenting with seizures and confusion, with MRI findings of bilateral occipital cortical hyperintensities. The clinical picture is characteristic of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), a clinical\u2013radiological entity often seen in the setting of severe hypertension (and other triggers such as eclampsia, renal failure, or immunosuppressive therapy). PRES is believed to result from a failure of autoregulation in the cerebral vasculature caused primarily by sudden severe hypertension. This leads to endothelial dysfunction and subsequent vasogenic edema (predominantly in the posterior circulation\u2014in the parieto\u2010occipital regions). Recent research supports the idea that cerebral hyperperfusion and disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier are key mechanisms in its development. Patients with PRES present with headache, nausea, altered consciousness, visual disturbances, and seizures. The MRI typically shows symmetrical hyperintense lesions on T2/FLAIR sequences in the parieto-occipital lobes. The condition is reversible if promptly recognized and managed by controlling blood pressure and addressing the underlying cause. Diagnosis of PRES is primarily clinical and radiologic. Differential diagnoses include acute ischemic stroke (which usually demonstrates diffusion restriction on MRI), encephalitis, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). The bilateral and posterior distribution on MRI helps to distinguish PRES from other entities. Management focuses on rapid control of blood pressure using IV antihypertensive agents (e.g., nicardipine or labetalol) in a controlled fashion \u2013 typically targeting a 25% reduction in mean arterial pressure over the first few hours. Seizure control with anticonvulsants may be required. In pregnant patients (e.g., eclampsia), intravenous magnesium sulfate is indicated and BP management should be tailored to maternal and fetal risks; lactating mothers should be managed similarly with appropriate follow\u2010up. Option A (PRES) is correct. Although the option is noted as 'PRESS', it is understood to be a reference to Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome. No other options were given, and the presentation aligns perfectly with this diagnosis. 1. PRES is reversible with prompt management. 2.

    "explanation": "In a 74\u2010year\u2010old male presenting with a cortical hemorrhage on CT, determining the cause of the hemorrhage is paramount. CT angiography (CTA) is the recommended next step, as it enables evaluation for underlying vascular abnormalities such as aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or the presence of active bleeding (spot sign). Intracerebral hemorrhages result from the rupture of abnormal or diseased vessels. In elderly patients, lobar hemorrhages may also be related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy; however, when the hemorrhage is large and cortical, evaluation for other vascular abnormalities is warranted. CTA can rapidly detect vascular anomalies that might have contributed to the bleed. The patient\u2019s clinical presentation along with the CT finding of a cortical hemorrhage suggests the need for urgent vascular imaging. CTA not only assists in identifying potential causes but also guides further management decisions (e.g., surgical intervention or conservative treatment). Following a non-contrast CT that identifies hemorrhage, the differential includes hypertensive hemorrhage, amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformations, and aneurysmal rupture. CTA helps differentiate these entities by visualizing the vascular structure. MRI can be useful later for parenchymal details, while conventional angiography is typically reserved for cases where CTA is non-diagnostic or for therapeutic intervention planning. Immediate management involves stabilization of the patient, blood pressure control, and reversal of anticoagulation if indicated. Guidelines suggest that CTA should be performed promptly to delineate the vascular anatomy and identify potential bleeding sources. In pregnant patients or lactating mothers, the risks and benefits of contrast exposure should be considered, but in life-threatening hemorrhage, maternal stabilization is prioritized. Option B (CTA) is correct because it provides a rapid, non-invasive method to evaluate the vascular anatomy in the setting of intracerebral hemorrhage. Option A (MRI) is less ideal in an acute hemorrhagic setting due to time constraints, while conventional angiography (Option C) is invasive and generally reserved for cases when non-invasive imaging is inconclusive or if endovascular therapy is contemplated. 1. CTA is critical in the acute evaluation of intracerebral hemorrhage to identify potential vascular abnormalities. 2. Lobar hemorrhages in the elderly warrant careful investigation for amyloid angiopathy and other vascular lesions. 3. Time is brain - rapid imaging guides management. Current stroke guidelines support the use of CTA following detection of intracerebral hemorrhage on CT to detect a bleeding source or vascular anomaly. It is now a standard component in the acute stroke imaging protocol, with recent studies validating its role in predicting hematoma expansion via the 'spot sign'.",

    "question": "Patient with small left internal capsule infarction and right-sided weakness for 2 days found to have PFO (not mentioned if there was a specific feature of it) HTN with uncontrolled BP. What is the treatment?",
    "option_a": "Aspirin",
    "option_b": "Warfarin",
    "option_c": "PFO closure",
    "option_d": "Aspirin and plavix",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with a small left internal capsule infarction and right-sided weakness. Although a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is detected, the clinical context (lacunar infarct with uncontrolled hypertension) strongly favors a small vessel (lacunar) infarct due to hypertensive arteriopathy rather than an embolic event from a paradoxical embolism through the PFO. Lacunar infarcts occur due to occlusion of small penetrating arteries, typically as a consequence of chronic hypertension leading to arteriolosclerosis. While PFO can be a conduit for paradoxical emboli, its prevalence in the general population and the presence of significant vascular risk factors (like uncontrolled high blood pressure) point to a hypertensive etiology. Recent research emphasizes proper patient selection for PFO closure, typically in young patients with cryptogenic stroke. The location of the infarct (internal capsule) and the clinical picture of pure motor stroke are classic for a lacunar event. In this context, the incidental finding of a PFO is unlikely to be the culprit. The focus should be on antiplatelet therapy and rigorous blood pressure control to prevent further lacunar events. Diagnosis of a lacunar stroke is made based on clinical features and supported by imaging (often CT or MRI showing a small deep infarct). Differential diagnoses include embolic strokes (which typically involve cortical areas) and large artery atherosclerosis. A detailed cardiac evaluation and sometimes transesophageal echocardiography can be performed to assess the significance of a PFO, but only in selected cases of cryptogenic stroke in younger patients. First-line management for lacunar stroke involves antiplatelet therapy, with aspirin being the standard agent. Concurrently, aggressive management of hypertension is required to reduce recurrence risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) is generally not indicated beyond the acute period except in specific scenarios. PFO closure is reserved for younger patients (<60 years) with cryptogenic stroke and high-risk PFO characteristics. In pregnancy and lactation, low-dose aspirin is often considered safe under guidance, but blood pressure management remains the priority. Option A (Aspirin) is correct. Warfarin (Option B) is not indicated in lacunar strokes without a cardioembolic source, and PFO closure (Option C) is generally not recommended in older patients with a clear alternative stroke mechanism. Option D (aspirin and clopidogrel) is not part of standard long-term management for lacunar strokes in this scenario. 1. Lacunar strokes are typically due to small vessel disease related to uncontrolled hypertension. 2. An incidental PFO in an elderly patient with classic lacunar findings is not an indication for closure. 3. Strict control of blood pressure is critical to preventing recurrent lacunar strokes. Recent trials and meta-analyses underscore that PFO closure benefits are confined to younger patients with cryptogenic stroke and high-risk anatomical features. The current approach in older patients or those with clear alternative etiologies (like hypertension-induced small vessel disease) remains antiplatelet therapy and risk factor modification.",

    "explanation": "Alexia without agraphia, often termed 'pure alexia,' is a disconnection syndrome where a patient loses the ability to read but retains the ability to write. This syndrome is most commonly associated with infarction in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), particularly affecting the left occipital lobe and the splenium of the corpus callosum. The left occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual input, and the splenium of the corpus callosum connects the visual cortex to language areas in the dominant hemisphere. When both are compromised\u2014commonly due to an occlusion of the left PCA\u2014the patient can still write (as language production centers are intact) but cannot comprehend written words because visual input is not adequately relayed to these centers. Patients present with homonymous hemianopia (usually right-sided if the left PCA is involved) and a striking disassociation: the ability to write remains preserved while reading is impaired. This clinical presentation is pathognomonic for alexia without agraphia. Imaging, particularly MRI, will reveal infarction in the left occipital lobe and may show involvement of the splenium. Differential diagnoses include other forms of aphasia; however, the preservation of writing ability distinguishes alexia without agraphia. Additional evaluations, such as formal neuropsychological testing and visual field assessments, aid in confirmation. Acute management of PCA stroke is similar to other ischemic strokes, where the focus is on reperfusion strategies (if within the thrombolytic window), antiplatelet therapy, and supportive care. Long-term management includes risk factor modification. In pregnant or lactating patients, thrombolytic therapy is considered only after careful risk\u2013benefit analysis and usually in specialized centers; antiplatelet therapies such as low-dose aspirin are generally considered safe under medical supervision. Option A (PCA) is correct as the syndrome is a classic presentation of a stroke in the distribution of the posterior cerebral artery, particularly affecting the left side. The other options, if presented, would not align with the vascular territory involved in this specific disconnection syndrome. 1. Alexia without agraphia is a classic disconnection syndrome resulting from left occipital and splenium involvement. 2. A key feature is the loss of reading ability in the presence of preserved writing skills. 3. It is most commonly associated with infarction of the PCA territory. Recent stroke management guidelines continue to emphasize the importance of rapid diagnosis and reperfusion in acute ischemic strokes, including PCA infarcts. Advances in neuroimaging have improved the accuracy of localizing the infarct and predicting outcomes in disconnection syndromes such as alexia without agraphia.",

    "question": "Patient with ataxia and vomiting CT attached (showing hypodensity at the whole right cerebellum at the level of the midbrain)",
    "option_a": "SCA",
    "option_b": "PCA",
    "option_c": "PICA",
    "option_d": "AICA",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question evaluates the understanding of cerebellar vascular territories and their infarction patterns. The cerebellum is supplied by three major arteries: the Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA), Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA), and Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA). A lesion seen at the level of the midbrain in the cerebellum is most consistent with the SCA territory. An infarction in the SCA territory occurs when there is occlusion, typically due to thromboembolism or local atherosclerotic disease, leading to ischemia of the superior aspect of the cerebellum. This ischemia disrupts cerebellar circuits responsible for coordination, resulting in ataxia, and can also affect vestibular integration, contributing to symptoms like vomiting. Clinically, a patient with an SCA infarct usually presents with acute cerebellar symptoms such as ataxia, imbalance, and vomiting. CT imaging will demonstrate hypodensity within the affected cerebellar region. The midbrain level slice implicates the superior portion of the cerebellum, which is supplied by the SCA. The diagnosis is initially established using non-contrast CT to identify hypodense areas indicating ischemia. MRI (especially diffusion-weighted imaging) is more sensitive in the acute setting. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic stroke, cerebellar tumors, demyelinating lesions, and infarctions in other cerebellar territories (PICA or AICA infarcts), which are distinguished by their specific vascular distribution and imaging characteristics. Management begins with acute stroke protocols including IV thrombolysis if within the time window, supportive care, and monitoring for complications like edema and hydrocephalus. In selected cases, neurosurgical decompression may be indicated. In pregnant patients, the risk\u2010benefit assessment for thrombolytics is critical, with a preference for imaging modalities and treatments that minimize fetal radiation exposure. For lactating mothers, treatment adjustments may be needed to avoid transmission of potentially teratogenic agents. Option A (SCA) is correct because the CT at the level of the midbrain with whole cerebellar involvement on the right side fits the SCA infarction pattern. Option B (PCA) is incorrect because the PCA supplies the occipital lobe. Option C (PICA) typically affects the inferior cerebellum, and Option D (AICA) supplies the anterior inferior portion of the cerebellum, neither matching the described imaging level. 1. In cerebellar strokes, early identification is key due to the risk of brainstem compression and hydrocephalus. 2. A CT slice at the midbrain level that shows cerebellar hypodensity is most suggestive of an SCA infarct. 3. Vomiting and ataxia without significant long tract signs point toward a localized cerebellar event. Recent guidelines emphasize early neuroimaging and prompt thrombolytic therapy, if appropriate, for ischemic stroke. Advances in MRI techniques help differentiate among cerebellar infarctions and assess for mass effect. Research continues to refine the management of posterior circulation strokes, particularly regarding surgical interventions in cases of cerebellar edema.",

    "question": "Lady with 2 abortions came with stroke what to order",

    "option_b": "Antithrombin 3",
    "option_c": "Antiphospholipid syndrome",
    "option_d": "Protein glycoprotein 20220",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question centers on the evaluation of hypercoagulable states leading to both thrombotic events (such as stroke) and recurrent pregnancy loss. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a prime example where autoimmune antibodies create a proclivity for thrombosis, manifesting in both obstetric and vascular complications. In APS, autoantibodies (including lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein I) interact with phospholipids and coagulation factors, leading to endothelial dysfunction and a hypercoagulable state. This results in thrombosis in both arteries and veins, as well as placental thrombosis, which can cause recurrent miscarriages. A young woman with a history of two abortions who now presents with a stroke fits the clinical picture of APS. The dual presentation of recurrent pregnancy loss and arterial thrombosis is highly suggestive of this syndrome, prompting evaluation with antiphospholipid antibody testing. The diagnostic workup includes testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein I antibodies, with repeat testing 12 weeks apart to confirm persistent positivity. Differential diagnoses include other thrombophilias such as Protein C deficiency, Protein S deficiency, and Factor V Leiden mutation; however, these rarely present with recurrent abortions to the degree seen in APS. Management of APS involves long-term anticoagulation. For a patient with a stroke, warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.0 is often used; however, in women of childbearing age, especially during pregnancy, warfarin is contraindicated. In pregnancy, low molecular weight heparin in combination with low-dose aspirin is recommended to reduce both thrombotic and obstetric complications. Breastfeeding mothers are generally safely managed with heparin therapy. Option A (Protein C deficiency) and Option B (Antithrombin 3 deficiency) are inherited thrombophilias that can cause thrombosis but are less commonly associated with recurrent miscarriages. Option D (Protein glycoprotein 20220 mutation) is associated with thrombosis but again, the combination of stroke and recurrent abortions is most suggestive of APS, making Option C the correct choice. 1. Recurrent pregnancy loss combined with thrombotic events is a classic presentation of APS. 2. Confirmatory testing for APS requires demonstration of persistent positivity for antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions, at least 12 weeks apart. 3. Management strategies differ drastically during pregnancy, with a shift toward heparin-based therapies. Recent guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology and hematology recommend aggressive anticoagulation in APS patients with thrombotic events. There is increasing evidence to support the combination of low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose aspirin in pregnant patients to reduce both thrombotic risk and miscarriage rates. Additionally, DOACs are being evaluated but have not yet supplanted warfarin or heparin in high-risk APS, especially in a pregnant population.",
