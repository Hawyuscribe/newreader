    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) is a rare disorder characterized by chaotic, multidirectional rapid eye movements (opsoclonus) along with myoclonic jerks and ataxia. It is considered a paraneoplastic or parainfectious autoimmune phenomenon. In paraneoplastic OMS, autoantibodies (often anti-Ri) mediate an immune attack on neuronal structures, particularly in the brainstem and cerebellum. In adults, OMS is frequently associated with underlying malignancies. Breast cancer is one of the neoplasms implicated in the development of paraneoplastic OMS. Adult patients with OMS typically present with rapid, irregular eye movements, myoclonus, and sometimes ataxia. Given its paraneoplastic nature, identifying an underlying malignancy (such as breast cancer) is crucial for targeted management. The workup for OMS includes neuroimaging (MRI) to exclude alternative structural causes, serum and cerebrospinal fluid studies for onconeuronal antibodies (eg, anti-Ri), and a thorough search for an occult malignancy using appropriate imaging modalities. Differential diagnoses include other paraneoplastic syndromes (e.g., Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and autoimmune encephalitides. Management involves treating the underlying malignancy with appropriate oncologic strategies, along with immunotherapy (corticosteroids, IVIG, or plasmapheresis) to mitigate the immune-mediated damage. For pregnant and lactating patients, treatment must carefully balance maternal benefits and fetal risks; many immunosuppressants require risk\u2013benefit discussions and close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team. Option A (breast cancer) is a correct association in the context of adult-onset Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, as breast cancer is one of the malignancies known to trigger a paraneoplastic immune response leading to OMS. The lack of other options in the question limits further analysis, but breast cancer remains a well-documented cause in adults. 1) In adults presenting with OMS, always consider a paraneoplastic etiology and initiate an appropriate cancer workup. 2) Anti-Ri antibodies are often found in breast cancer-associated OMS. 3) Early recognition and combined oncologic and immunotherapy can improve outcomes. Recent studies have highlighted the role of autoantibodies in OMS and underscore the importance of comprehensive cancer screening in adults presenting with this syndrome. Ongoing research into immunomodulatory therapies continues to refine management strategies.",

    "question": "This is 9 yo boy medically free, he develop abnormal movements of UL and LL with gait instability. (Video showed chorea acanthocytisis) The family reported 6 weeks history of runny nose. CBac, chemistry normal. What is The diagnosis?",
    "option_a": "Sydenham chorea",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Sydenham chorea, also known as St. Vitus\u2019 dance, is a manifestation of rheumatic fever that occurs in children following an infection with group A Streptococcus. It is characterized by rapid, involuntary, jerky movements and is one of the major Jones criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever. The condition is believed to result from molecular mimicry, where antibodies generated in response to a streptococcal infection mistakenly attack neuronal tissue, particularly within the basal ganglia. This autoimmune process leads to the characteristic choreiform movements seen in the disorder. In the presented 9-year-old boy, the onset of abnormal movements in the upper and lower limbs combined with gait instability and a history of a runny nose (a potential upper respiratory tract infection) about 6 weeks earlier is highly suggestive of Sydenham chorea. Normal CBC and chemistry support an isolated neurological manifestation rather than a systemic illness. Clinical diagnosis relies on a detailed history, demonstrating a recent streptococcal infection and the typical choreiform movements. Differential diagnoses include Wilson\u2019s disease (which would have accompanying liver dysfunction and abnormal copper studies), pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), and other genetic movement disorders. Laboratory evaluation (including antistreptolysin O titers) and echocardiography may further help in confirming a diagnosis of rheumatic fever. Management focuses on supportive care and symptomatic treatment. Antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin is recommended to prevent recurrent streptococcal infections. In severe cases, immunomodulatory treatment such as corticosteroids may be employed. For chorea control, agents such as valproic acid or carbamazepine can be used. In pregnancy and lactation, penicillin is considered safe, but the use of immunomodulators requires careful evaluation of risks and benefits along with specialist consultation. Option A (Sydenham chorea) is correct as the clinical presentation (age, recent upper respiratory infection, chorea, gait instability, and normal routine labs) fits classic Sydenham chorea. Other conditions (while not listed) such as neuroacanthocytosis occur later in life and have different clinical features, thus making Sydenham chorea the most appropriate diagnosis in this setting. 1) Sydenham chorea typically manifests weeks after a streptococcal infection, even if the initial symptoms are mild. 2) It is one of the major Jones criteria for acute rheumatic fever. 3) Normal routine labs are common, and serologic evidence of recent streptococcal infection is the key diagnostic clue. Contemporary guidelines continue to support the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with Sydenham chorea. Recent research emphasizes the autoimmune basis of the disorder and is evaluating immunomodulatory strategies for severe cases. Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for rheumatic heart disease.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) patients who have been on levodopa for several years often develop motor complications such as motor fluctuations (wearing\u2010off) and levodopa\u2010induced dyskinesias (typically a peak-dose phenomenon). The goal in management is to reduce the high plasma peaks responsible for dyskinesia while still providing continuous dopaminergic stimulation. Long\u2010term levodopa therapy leads to changes in the dopaminergic receptors and alterations in post-synaptic signaling. High peaks in levodopa concentration trigger overactivation at the striatal level, leading to involuntary movements (dyskinesia), whereas the short duration of action produces wearing-off phenomena. This pharmacodynamic fluctuation is the key mechanism underlying these complications. Clinically, patients report dyskinesias coinciding with the peak plasma levels of levodopa and \u2018wearing off\u2019 before the next dose. In this case, the patient experiences a 1.5\u2010hour effect followed by peak-onset dyskinesia. These motor fluctuations are typical in PD after prolonged levodopa use, often impacting quality of life. The diagnosis of levodopa-induced complications is clinical. Differential diagnoses include inconsistencies in medication absorption, other atypical parkinsonian disorders, or suboptimal timing of dosing. Careful review of the medication schedule, symptom diary, and sometimes pharmacokinetic studies can help attribute symptoms to fluctuations rather than disease progression. Based on current guidelines, management follows a tiered approach: First-line strategies involve optimizing the levodopa regimen by reducing the individual dose while fractionating the total daily dose (i.e. giving smaller doses more frequently) to flatten the plasma curve. In patients where dyskinesia is prominent, adding amantadine (which has evidence for reducing levodopa-induced dyskinesia) is recommended. Adjunct therapies (e.g., COMT inhibitors, MAO-B inhibitors) may be considered if wearing-off is the dominant issue. Surgical options like deep brain stimulation (DBS) are reserved for refractory cases. In pregnancy or lactation (when applicable), the potential risks of amantadine versus benefits must be critically weighed, as data are limited and most dopaminergic therapies are used with caution. Option A (Add Artaib) is interpreted as adding an agent such as amantadine, which is known to reduce peak-dose dyskinesia. Option B (Decrease levodopa and increase interval) suggests lowering the dose (which could be helpful) but increasing the dosing interval is counterproductive as it leads to longer off-periods and worsened wearing-off. Option C (Rescue injection) does not address the underlying dyskinesia/wearing-off issue. Option D (DBS or LGIs better) refers to advanced interventions that are not first-line in this situation. Hence, the best initial step is to add amantadine. 1. Peak-dose dyskinesia is best managed by flattening the levodopa plasma curve. 2. Amantadine is the only medication with compelling evidence to reduce levodopa-induced dyskinesia. 3. When adjusting levodopa, reducing the individual dose while increasing dosing frequency (not the dosing interval) is key. Recent clinical guidelines and studies continue to support amantadine\u2019s role in reducing levodopa-induced dyskinesias. There is increasing emphasis on the importance of maintaining continuous dopaminergic stimulation by fractionating the levodopa dose rather than simply extending dosing intervals.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. The condition frequently responds to dopaminergic therapy, which is a cornerstone in managing RLS. Although the precise mechanism of RLS is not fully understood, dopaminergic dysfunction and iron deficiency in the central nervous system are implicated. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, dopaminergic pathways are already disturbed, and RLS may either emerge as a comorbid condition or be unmasked by therapy adjustments. Patients typically present with symptoms that worsen during periods of inactivity (especially in the evening or at night) and improve with movement. In a PD patient who also exhibits features of RLS, the overlap can be clinically challenging, but the dopaminergic system is central to both conditions. The diagnosis of RLS is clinical. Differential diagnoses include akathisia, peripheral neuropathy, nocturnal leg cramps, and positional discomfort. A careful history focusing on the timing of symptoms and their alleviation with movement helps establish the diagnosis. The first-line treatment for RLS is the use of dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or ropinirole). In PD patients, care must be taken to balance the dopaminergic therapy since they are often already on levodopa or other agents. For pregnant or lactating women, nonpharmacologic measures or careful use of medications is advised given the limited safety data on dopamine agonists during these periods. Option A (Dopamine agonist) is correct as dopamine agonists are the established first-line treatment for RLS. Other options (not provided) may include gabapentin or pregabalin, but in the context of PD and typical RLS features, dopamine agonists are more traditionally used. 1. Dopamine agonists are the cornerstone of RLS treatment. 2. RLS symptoms often worsen during periods of inactivity and are typically relieved by movement. 3. In PD patients, careful medication balancing is required to manage both the underlying disease and RLS. Recent research and clinical guidelines reaffirm the central role of dopamine agonists in RLS management. Emerging studies also highlight the importance of iron metabolism in RLS, suggesting that iron supplementation may be beneficial in patients with low serum ferritin levels.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD) is an atypical parkinsonian syndrome characterized by asymmetric motor symptoms and cortical signs. It commonly presents with features such as dystonia, bradykinesia, myoclonus, and phenomena like gaze or limb apraxia. CBD involves progressive neurodegeneration with tau protein accumulation predominantly affecting the cortex and the basal ganglia. This results in asymmetric dysfunction and presents with both extrapyramidal and cortical signs including myoclonus and dystonia. Patients with CBD typically exhibit unilateral or markedly asymmetric motor symptoms. The patient described shows left arm dystonia, bradykinesia, and myoclonus; head turning (a possible sign of impaired ocular motor control or a compensatory mechanism due to apraxia) is also seen. These clinical features align well with CBD rather than other neurodegenerative conditions. The diagnosis of CBD is primarily clinical, supplemented by imaging studies (MRI, PET) that may show asymmetric cortical atrophy, typically parietal. Differential diagnoses include other atypical parkinsonian syndromes such as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (which has prominent vertical gaze palsy), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (which has fluctuating cognition and visual hallucinations), and Frontotemporal Dementia (which typically presents with prominent behavioral changes). There is no curative treatment for CBD. The management is supportive and symptomatic. Levodopa trials may be attempted although the response is usually limited. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies are important. In cases with significant dystonia or myoclonus, medications like baclofen or benzodiazepines can be considered. As this condition mainly affects older adults, pregnancy and lactation issues do not apply. Option A (FTD) is primarily a cognitive/behavioral disorder. Option B (AD) primarily presents with memory impairment and a more symmetric progression. Option C (DLB) is characterized by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Option D (CBD) best fits the asymmetric motor and cortical signs described in this patient. 1. Corticobasal Degeneration often presents with markedly asymmetric motor deficits. 2. The combination of dystonia, bradykinesia, and myoclonus in one limb is highly suggestive of CBD. 3. Poor response to levodopa is a characteristic observation in CBD. Recent advances in imaging and biomarkers have improved recognition of CBD. Current consensus guidelines focus on symptomatic management and highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, as disease-modifying treatments remain investigational.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Genetic factors are implicated in Parkinson\u2019s disease, with several genes identified in familial forms. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations are recognized as the most common genetic cause of familial PD, especially in certain ethnic groups. Mutations in the LRRK2 gene lead to abnormal protein function, which affects neuronal survival and synaptic function, contributing to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Although Parkin mutations are also associated with PD, they are more typically implicated in early-onset cases and are less common overall. Patients with LRRK2-associated PD often present with clinical features that are similar to idiopathic PD, including bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. The clinical course can be variable, but the genetic predisposition is important for understanding familial transmission. Confirmation often involves genetic testing in patients with a family history or early-onset PD. Differential genetic causes include Parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1 mutations. A detailed family history and genetic counseling are essential components of the evaluation. Management of LRRK2-associated PD is similar to idiopathic PD, utilizing dopaminergic therapies (levodopa, dopamine agonists) and adjunct medications. While genetic factors do not usually change initial management, genetic counseling is recommended. In pregnancy or lactation, standard PD treatments are used with caution, balancing maternal benefits with fetal risks. Option A (LARK 2) refers to LRRK2, which is the most commonly implicated familial gene in PD. Option B (Parkin) is more commonly linked to early-onset PD and is less common overall compared to LRRK2 mutations in familial cases. 1. LRRK2 is the most common identified genetic mutation in familial PD. 2. Parkin mutations, though associated with PD, are typically seen in early-onset cases. 3. Genetic testing and counseling are important in familial PD cases. Recent genetic studies have reinforced the prevalence of LRRK2 mutations in familial Parkinson\u2019s disease, with ongoing research into targeted therapies for LRRK2-associated PD. Current guidelines also emphasize the role of genetic screening in patients with a strong family history of PD.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) can occur as either a sporadic or familial disorder. Familial PD is often linked to specific genetic mutations. Among these, the LRRK2 gene mutation, especially the G2019S variant, is recognized as the most common mutation associated with familial forms of PD, displaying autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. Mutations in the LRRK2 gene result in abnormal kinase activity and protein aggregation, leading to progressive degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. This neurodegeneration is histologically characterized by Lewy body deposition, which is central to PD pathology. The G2019S mutation is particularly noted for its prevalence in several populations and contributes to both familial and some sporadic cases. Patients with LRRK2-associated PD present with the classic motor symptoms of PD, including bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. The clinical progression mirrors that of idiopathic PD, thus making LRRK2 mutations a significant consideration in familial cases. Diagnosis of PD remains clinical; however, when a familial history is present, genetic testing for mutations such as LRRK2 can be helpful. Differential diagnoses include other familial parkinsonian syndromes caused by mutations in genes like SNCA, Parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1. Genetic counseling is recommended when a mutation is identified. The mainstay of PD management is symptomatic treatment, typically beginning with levodopa and dopamine agonists. In refractory cases, deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be considered. Although no LRRK2-specific treatment exists, current research is exploring LRRK2 inhibitors. In pregnant or lactating patients, levodopa is generally considered relatively safe, but treatment must be individualized after a risk\u2010benefit evaluation. Non-pharmacologic interventions (physical therapy, occupational therapy) are also integral. Option A (LRRK2) is correct because among the known familial mutations in PD, LRRK2, particularly the G2019S mutation, is the most frequently identified. Other mutations (like Parkin) are typically associated with early onset and autosomal recessive inheritance. 1. The LRRK2 mutation (G2019S) is the most common identifiable cause in familial PD cases. 2. LRRK2-associated PD clinically resembles idiopathic PD. 3. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis in familial cases but does not alter the main therapeutic approaches. Recent studies continue to emphasize the role of LRRK2 in the pathogenesis of PD, with clinical trials underway exploring LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. In addition, updated genetic screening recommendations now often include LRRK2 analysis for familial PD cases.",

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal movements, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive decline. The definitive diagnosis is based on detecting an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, leading to the production of a mutant huntingtin protein. This abnormal protein forms aggregates that interfere with neuronal function and cause selective neurodegeneration, particularly in the caudate nucleus and putamen. This results in the characteristic movement abnormalities, including chorea and dystonia. Clinically, HD presents with hyperkinetic movements (such as chorea and dystonia), psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline. In the case described, the presence of orolingual dystonia combined with a strong family history and early parental death strongly suggests HD. While orolingual dystonia can occur in other conditions, the autosomal dominant pattern supports the diagnosis of Huntington's disease. The diagnostic workup for suspected HD includes genetic testing to assess the number of CAG repeats in the HTT gene. Differential diagnoses include neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, which would typically also show acanthocytes in blood smears and additional neurological signs (e.g., seizures, peripheral neuropathy). The family history and clinical findings in this case further favor HD. There is no cure for HD; management is primarily symptomatic and supportive. Tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine may be used to manage chorea. Psychiatric symptoms are treated with standard medications, including antidepressants and antipsychotics as needed. Genetic counseling is essential for affected individuals and their families. In pregnancy and lactation, medication choices should be carefully considered due to potential teratogenic effects, and therapy is generally tailored to minimize fetal exposure while managing maternal symptoms. Option A (blood film for acanthocytes) is intended to screen for neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, which are less consistent with the family history and clinical picture described. Option B (Huntington\u2019s repeat) is correct because genetic testing for the expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene is the definitive diagnostic test for HD. 1. A positive family history in an autosomal dominant pattern strongly raises suspicion for HD. 2. Genetic confirmation via CAG repeat testing is the gold standard for diagnosis. 3. Early testing facilitates timely genetic counseling and appropriate symptom management. Guidelines continue to support genetic testing for HD when clinical suspicion is high. Current research is focused on potential gene-silencing strategies and other therapeutic approaches targeting the mutant huntingtin protein, although these remain investigational.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Essential tremor is a common movement disorder characterized by action and postural tremors that are often refractory to medical treatment. For patients with medically refractory tremor, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established surgical option. The pathophysiology of essential tremor is thought to involve abnormal oscillatory activity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit, particularly within the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus. DBS modulates this aberrant firing by delivering high-frequency electrical stimulation to the VIM nucleus, thereby reducing tremor amplitude. Patients with refractory essential tremor typically suffer from significant functional impairment. The tremor is more pronounced with voluntary movement and can affect the hands, head, and voice, leading to interference with daily activities. The diagnosis of essential tremor is primarily clinical, based on the characteristic action and postural tremors. Differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease (characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity) and dystonic tremor. Neuroimaging is generally not required unless an atypical presentation is noted. First-line management of essential tremor includes pharmacologic therapy with beta blockers (e.g., propranolol) and primidone. For patients who do not respond to medication, DBS targeting the VIM nucleus of the thalamus is the second-line treatment. In women who are pregnant or lactating, medical management must consider medication safety; beta blockers and primidone carry potential risks, and surgical interventions are generally postponed if possible until after pregnancy. Option A (thalamus) is correct because the VIM nucleus within the thalamus is the standard target for DBS in refractory essential tremor. Option B (hypothalamus) and Option C (globus pallidus) are incorrect as they are not established targets for tremor control in essential tremor. 1. DBS targeting the VIM nucleus of the thalamus provides significant relief for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor. 2. Essential tremor is the most common tremor disorder and often has a familial pattern. 3. The decision to proceed with DBS requires multidisciplinary evaluation, particularly regarding surgical candidacy. Recent reviews and consensus guidelines reaffirm the effectiveness of VIM thalamic DBS in controlling tremor symptoms in patients with essential tremor. Clinical trials continue to refine stimulation parameters and assess long-term outcomes.",

    "explanation": "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is an atypical parkinsonian syndrome characterized by specific motor dysfunctions and distinctive neuroimaging findings. It is recognized as one of the Parkinson-plus syndromes, with a set of clinical features that differentiate it from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. PSP is a tauopathy, which means it is associated with the abnormal accumulation of tau protein in the brain. This leads to neurodegeneration in the brainstem, basal ganglia, and frontal lobes. Degeneration of the midbrain, in particular, results in the characteristic vertical gaze palsy and postural instability seen in PSP. Clinically, PSP presents with early falls, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (especially affecting downward gaze), bradykinesia, masked facies, and axial rigidity (including retrocollis). The \u2018hummingbird sign\u2019 on MRI, which reflects midbrain atrophy with preserved pons, is a radiologic hallmark that strongly supports the diagnosis. The diagnosis of PSP is clinical, supported by neuroimaging findings. Differential diagnoses include Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD). MSA typically presents with autonomic dysfunction and cerebellar signs, LBD with early dementia and hallucinations, and CBD with asymmetric cortical deficits like apraxia. The presence of vertical gaze palsy and the hummingbird sign are most consistent with PSP. Treatment for PSP is largely supportive, as no disease-modifying therapies exist. Levodopa trials may be considered, although they often have limited benefit. Management includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and strategies to prevent falls. In advanced cases, symptomatic management of dysphagia and communication difficulties may be needed. Given the typical age group, pregnancy and lactation considerations are not applicable in PSP. Option A (PSP) is correct because the constellation of clinical features (early falls, vertical gaze palsy, masked facies, retrocollis) and the MRI hummingbird sign are classical for PSP. Option B (MSA) is incorrect due to the absence of significant autonomic dysfunction and cerebellar signs. Option C (LBD) is unlikely given the lack of early dementia and visual hallucinations, and Option D (CBD) is ruled out by the absence of asymmetric cortical features. 1. Vertical gaze palsy is a key distinguishing feature of PSP. 2. The hummingbird sign on MRI is highly suggestive of PSP. 3.

    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by the loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep. In Parkinson's disease (PD), RBD is one of the more characteristic sleep disorders linked to the underlying neurodegenerative changes affecting brainstem regions that regulate REM sleep. The pathophysiology involves degeneration of brainstem nuclei (such as the sublaterodorsal nucleus) that normally suppress motor activity during REM sleep. In PD, abnormal deposition of alpha\u2010synuclein and disruption in neurotransmitter pathways reduce inhibitory control, leading to the muscle activity seen during REM, which normally should be suppressed. Patients (often noted by bed partners) may demonstrate dream enactment behaviors, sometimes involving aggressive movements. RBD can precede the motor features of PD by years, making it a potential early marker of neurodegenerative disease. It is distinctly different from other sleep disorders that may be associated with PD such as insomnia or restless legs syndrome. Diagnosis is made based on clinical history and confirmed with polysomnography, which shows REM sleep without atonia. Differential diagnoses include other parasomnias (e.g., sleepwalking, confusional arousals), obstructive sleep apnea, and even nocturnal seizures; however, the loss of atonia during REM is a specific hallmark of RBD. First-line treatment for RBD includes using melatonin (usually starting at low doses) or clonazepam. Care must be taken with clonazepam, especially in elderly patients, due to risks of sedation and falls. In special populations such as pregnant or lactating women, melatonin\u2019s safety profile is not well established, so treatment must be individualized with careful risk\u2013benefit analysis and consultation with a sleep specialist. Option A (REM Sleep Behavior Disorder) is correct because it specifically correlates with the known association between PD and the loss of REM atonia. Other listed sleep disorders such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, or restless legs syndrome, though they can occur in PD, do not have the same specific neuroanatomical linkage and are managed differently. 1) RBD may be an early indicator of an evolving synucleinopathy such as PD. 2) Detailed sleep history and bed partner reports are crucial in the diagnosis. 3) Polysomnography is key for confirmation. Recent studies continue to substantiate the link between RBD and synucleinopathies. Current guidelines advocate for a careful, individualized approach to management, with emerging evidence evaluating low\u2010dose melatonin as both effective and well tolerated compared to clonazepam.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder causing an irresistible urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by unpleasant sensations. Its pathogenesis appears linked to dopaminergic dysfunction, making dopamine agonists effective. RLS is thought to be related to both dopaminergic dysregulation and iron metabolism disturbances within the central nervous system. In PD, the dopaminergic system is inherently compromised, and RLS may be an extension of this dysfunction. Clinically, RLS presents with discomfort in the legs, particularly at rest and during the evening, which improves with movement. This can significantly affect sleep quality and day\u2010time functioning. The association with PD further underscores the role of dopamine in its pathogenesis. Diagnosis is predominantly clinical based on patient history. Differential diagnoses include peripheral neuropathy, akathisia, and nocturnal leg cramps. Iron studies should be obtained given the link between iron deficiency and RLS. First-line treatment for RLS involves the use of dopamine agonists such as pramipexole or ropinirole. Adjunctive therapies include ensuring adequate iron stores. In pregnant patients, management is challenging because many dopaminergic agents carry potential risks, and non-pharmacologic strategies along with iron supplementation (if deficient) are generally recommended. Close consultation with obstetrics is advised when treating RLS in pregnancy or lactation. Option A is correct because dopamine agonists are established as effective first-line therapy for RLS. Options like parasomnias, neuropathy, or RBD are unrelated to the dopaminergic treatment mechanism and do not typically respond to dopamine agonists. 1) RLS symptoms often worsen in the evening and can profoundly disrupt sleep. 2) Dopamine agonists not only alleviate RLS symptoms but also highlight the dopaminergic role in the disorder. 3) Always check iron studies, as iron deficiency can exacerbate RLS. Contemporary clinical guidelines reinforce dopamine agonists as first-line therapy for RLS. Multiple randomized controlled trials support their efficacy, and current research continues to explore the role of iron supplementation and alternative treatments in special populations, including pregnant women.",

    "option_a": "Sydenham chorea",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Sydenham chorea is a neurological disorder associated with rheumatic fever, typically seen in children. It is characterized by rapid, involuntary movements and is believed to be immune-mediated following a group A streptococcal infection. The underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune reaction where antibodies generated against streptococcal antigens cross-react with basal ganglia neurons. This molecular mimicry leads to inflammation and dysfunction in regions of the brain that control motor activity. Typically affecting children between 5 and 15 years old, Sydenham chorea presents with rapid, purposeless movements of the limbs, facial grimacing, and gait instability. A history of a recent infection (often pharyngitis or even a cold-like illness) is common. Despite the mention of 'chorea acanthocytosis' in the video description, the clinical context (age, history of runny nose, normal labs) is more consistent with Sydenham chorea. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by evidence of recent streptococcal infection (e.g., elevated ASO titers) and the presence of other rheumatic fever criteria. Differential diagnoses include Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), Huntington\u2019s disease (which is rare in this age group), and benign hereditary chorea. The absence of other systemic findings and normal laboratory results help steer the diagnosis toward Sydenham chorea. Management includes addressing the underlying streptococcal infection with appropriate antibiotics (such as penicillin) and implementing prophylaxis to prevent recurrence of rheumatic fever. Symptomatic treatment for chorea can include drugs such as valproic acid or carbamazepine. In severe cases, immunomodulatory therapies like corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can be considered. In terms of pregnancy and lactation (though less relevant in a pediatric setting), medications like valproic acid and carbamazepine are teratogenic and should be avoided in women of childbearing potential, with safer alternatives guided by obstetric consultation. Option A (Sydenham chorea) is the correct answer given the patient\u2019s age, history of a recent infection, and clinical presentation. The marked answer of Option B is incorrect because chorea acanthocytosis is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with a different clinical picture (typically with acanthocytes on blood smear and a later age of onset), and does not fit the described scenario. 1) Sydenham chorea may sometimes be the sole manifestation of acute rheumatic fever, occurring weeks after a streptococcal infection. 2) It is one of the few choreas where the treatment also involves prophylaxis against recurrent streptococcal infections. 3) Always consider the patient\u2019s age and recent infection history when evaluating pediatric chorea. Recent guidelines emphasize early recognition of Sydenham chorea as a major criterion for rheumatic fever, even when isolated. Ongoing research is focused on the role of immunomodulatory treatments in severe cases, and antibiotic prophylaxis remains the gold standard for preventing rheumatic fever recurrences.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "In Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), long-term levodopa therapy often leads to motor fluctuations, including 'wearing off' phenomena and peak-dose dyskinesias. The aim of management is to achieve a more constant dopaminergic stimulation throughout the dosing cycle. The fluctuating plasma levels of levodopa result from its short half-life and variable absorption. Rapid peaks and troughs in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to dyskinesias (particularly at peak levels) and periods of akinesia when levels drop (wearing off). Adjusting the dosing frequency can help smooth these fluctuations. Patients frequently report that the effects of Sinemet wear off before the next scheduled dose (in this case, about 2.5 hours early) and experience involuntary movements when levodopa levels are peaking. This classic scenario reflects the pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors caused by less frequent, higher doses. Assessment involves a detailed review of the medication regimen and the timing of symptoms relative to dosing. Differential diagnoses include suboptimal absorption of medication due to gastrointestinal issues or medication- related side effects from adjunct therapies. Careful clinical history and sometimes a levodopa challenge can help clarify the situation. The first-line management for motor fluctuations is to optimize levodopa therapy. Increasing the frequency of Sinemet dosing (while possibly reducing each individual dose) helps in maintaining more stable plasma levels, thereby reducing \u2018off\u2019 time as well as peak-dose dyskinesias. Other strategies include using adjunctive therapies like COMT inhibitors, MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline already being used), or, in refractory cases, considering deep brain stimulation (DBS). In pregnant or lactating women with PD, medication adjustments require a careful risk\u2013benefit analysis due to potential teratogenic risks or neonatal effects; non-surgical options remain preferred, and any change should involve multidisciplinary consultation. Option A (DBS surgery) is not appropriate at this stage because it is reserved for patients with symptoms refractory to optimized medical therapy. Option B (adding a dopamine agonist) can sometimes reduce \u2018off\u2019 time but may worsen peak-dose dyskinesias and carry side effects like impulse control disorders. Option C (increasing the frequency of Sinemet) is the optimal first step as it leads to more continuous dopaminergic stimulation. Option D isn\u2019t provided and thus is not considered. 1) Adjusting the dosing frequency of levodopa can often mitigate both wearing-off and peak dyskinesias. 2) DBS is typically a later intervention reserved for advanced, refractory cases. 3) Tailor therapy carefully, as changes affecting plasma levels may have direct impacts on motor complications. Recent management guidelines for PD emphasize individualized adjustments in levodopa dosing to minimize motor fluctuations before considering surgical options. Evidence supports that increased dosing frequency and fractionation of the levodopa dose can significantly improve motor control and quality of life in PD patients.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question focuses on the management of motor fluctuations in Parkinson\u2019s disease, specifically addressing the clinical scenario where a patient experiences 'off' symptoms nearing the end of a levodopa dosing interval combined with peak-dose dyskinesia. The core idea is to achieve a smoother dopaminergic stimulation by adjusting the dosing regimen. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, intermittent (pulsatile) dopaminergic stimulation with levodopa leads to motor complications over time, including wearing-off phenomena and dyskinesia. As the plasma levels of levodopa rise and fall, patients may experience peak dyskinesia when levels are high and 'off' symptoms when levels dip. This fluctuation is primarily a result of the progressive loss of nigrostriatal neurons causing a narrower therapeutic window. The patient\u2019s history of off symptoms occurring about 2.5 hours before the next dose and the presence of peak dyskinesia suggests that dosing is creating peaks and troughs in dopamine levels. By reducing the size of each dose and increasing dosing frequency, one can achieve more continuous dopaminergic stimulation and help smooth out these fluctuations. The approach includes a careful review of the patient\u2019s dosing schedule and symptom diary. The differential diagnosis centers around levodopa-induced motor fluctuations as opposed to disease progression. It\u2019s important to differentiate these issues from other movement disorders or medication side effects. Current management guidelines recommend modifying the levodopa regimen for motor fluctuations. First-line management is to decrease the individual dose and increase the frequency (thus providing a more continuous stimulation). Other strategies include extended-release formulations or adjunctive medications (dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors) if necessary. In pregnant or lactating patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, careful risk-benefit analyses are essential, with levodopa remaining the gold standard but dosing adjustments and multidisciplinary involvement are critical. Option A (Decrease individual dose with increasing frequency) is correct because it is designed to provide smoother plasma levels and reduce both the off times and the peak-dose dyskinesias. Option B (Referral for subthalamic nucleus DBS) is typically reserved for advanced cases refractory to medical therapy. Option C (Increase dose) would likely exacerbate dyskinesias. Option D (Add dopamine agonist) and Option E (Add MAO-B inhibitor) may add benefit in some scenarios but do not directly address the issue of peak-dose dyskinesia coupled with wearing off. 1. Small, frequent doses of levodopa can help minimize motor fluctuations. 2. Peak-dose dyskinesia is often a consequence of high levodopa peaks; smoothing out these levels can improve symptoms. Recent guidelines and studies support the strategy of continuous dopaminergic stimulation to reduce motor complications. Adjustments in dosing frequency, rather than simply increasing the dose, are recommended to balance the benefits of levodopa with its potential adverse effects.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question is designed to test the recognition of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) based on its distinct clinical and radiological features. Key signs such as square wave jerks and the hummingbird sign on MRI are classic for PSP. PSP is an atypical parkinsonian syndrome characterized by the accumulation of tau protein, leading to progressive neurodegeneration primarily affecting the midbrain and basal ganglia. The degeneration in the midbrain results in the hummingbird sign due to midbrain atrophy and relatively preserved pons. Patients with PSP typically present with parkinsonian features that do not respond well to levodopa, along with early falls, vertical gaze palsy, and impaired balance. The presence of square wave jerks (rapid, small amplitude horizontal eye movements) further corroborates this diagnosis. The diagnostic workup includes clinical evaluation, detailed neurological examination, and brain imaging (MRI). Differentiation from other parkinsonian disorders (such as idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple system atrophy, and corticobasal degeneration) is based on features such as poor levodopa responsiveness and specific imaging findings like the hummingbird sign. Management of PSP is largely symptomatic. First-line therapy might include a cautious trial of levodopa (although benefits are limited), as well as supportive measures such as physical and occupational therapy. There are currently no disease-modifying therapies. In the context of pregnancy or lactation (which is rare given the typical age of onset), medication safety profiles must be considered carefully. Option A (Progressive supranuclear palsy) is correct based on the combination of clinical signs (square wave jerks) and imaging findings (hummingbird sign). Options B, C, D, and E represent other parkinsonian or hydrocephalic syndromes that do not align with the distinctive features of PSP. 1. The hummingbird sign on MRI is a classic marker of PSP, reflecting midbrain atrophy. 2. Square wave jerks in eye movements are frequently seen in PSP and help differentiate it from other movement disorders. Emerging research continues to explore tau-targeted therapies for PSP, although current management remains symptomatic and supportive.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question assesses the recognition of the phenomenology of movement disorders. Chorea is defined by its brief, irregular, and unpredictable movements, and the case provided (including a video) demonstrates these features. Chorea results from dysfunction in the basal ganglia circuits, particularly involving dopaminergic signaling. It can be seen in various etiologies including metabolic derangements, neurodegenerative disorders (like Huntington\u2019s disease), or medication-induced movement disorders. The spontaneous and generalized nature of the movements seen in the video is characteristic of chorea. These movements are non-rhythmic and unpredictable, differentiating them from other movement disorders such as tics or dystonia. The diagnostic evaluation includes detailed patient history, neurological examination, and potentially genetic testing or metabolic work-ups depending on suspected causes. Differential diagnoses include tics (which are typically suppressible and preceded by an urge) and dystonia (which involves sustained, abnormal postures). Management of chorea depends on its underlying cause. If symptomatic treatment is required, dopamine receptor blockers (such as haloperidol) or agents like tetrabenazine can be considered. In the setting of pregnancy or lactation, medication choices must be made cautiously to avoid teratogenic effects or adverse neonatal outcomes. Option A (Chorea) is correct, as the described movements match the textbook definition of chorea. Option B (Tics) is incorrect because tics are usually repetitive, suppressible, and associated with a premonitory urge. Option C (Task specific dystonia) does not fit the spontaneous, generalized nature of the movements. Options D and E do not accurately describe the phenomenology presented. 1. Chorea movements are brief, irregular, and non-patterned, distinguishing them from other hyperkinetic disorders. 2. The distinction between chorea and tics is important, as tics are often suppressible and have a premonitory sensation. Recent clinical research continues to explore novel pharmacologic agents (like VMAT2 inhibitors) for chorea management, although treatment remains largely etiology-specific. Updated guidelines stress the importance of accurate phenomenological classification in guiding therapy.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This case presents a patient with a clinical picture suggestive of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), characterized by a triad of gait disturbance/parkinsonism, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. The imaging finding of moderate ventriculomegaly with relatively mild cerebral atrophy strongly supports this diagnosis. NPH is believed to result from impaired CSF absorption leading to ventricular enlargement without significantly elevated intracranial pressure, which in turn disrupts the periventricular white matter tracts. This process impairs gait and cognitive function. Parkinsonism may be a manifestation of gait apraxia seen in NPH rather than idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. The patient\u2019s symptoms of mild parkinsonism, longstanding urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment, along with imaging findings, point to NPH. Although a classic tap test via lumbar puncture is normally a step in confirming the diagnosis, the absence of this option requires considering a surgical referral based on clinical and radiological evidence. Diagnosis of NPH relies on the clinical triad and supportive neuroimaging. Differential diagnoses include idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (which typically has a better response to levodopa), vascular dementia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. A large-volume lumbar puncture (tap test) is often used to predict shunt responsiveness, but here the option is not provided. The first-line management after a positive tap test is the surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. In scenarios where an LP (tap test) is not available as an option, referring the patient for neurosurgical evaluation (Option B) is appropriate. For pregnant or lactating patients, careful interdisciplinary planning is required to balance surgical risks with maternal-fetal safety, though NPH is typically a condition seen in older adults. Option B (Refer to neurosurgery for VP insertion) is the most appropriate next step given the clinical scenario and the absence of an LP option. Option A (VO shunt) is not standard since a VP shunt is the treatment of choice. Option C (Levodopa trial) is more appropriate for idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Options D (anticholinergics) and E (physical therapy) do not address the underlying pathology of NPH. 1. NPH is the only potentially reversible cause of dementia if appropriately treated with a CSF shunt. 2. The classic clinical triad (gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment) along with ventriculomegaly on imaging should raise suspicion for NPH. Recent clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of a comprehensive evaluation including a tap test to predict shunt responsiveness in NPH. However, when a tap test isn\u2019t feasible or is not an option, referral to neurosurgery for definitive evaluation remains the best course of action. Ongoing research is investigating improved patient selection criteria and shunt technologies to optimize outcomes.",

    "explanation": "This question examines a mitochondrial disorder presenting primarily with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) that, when associated with additional systemic features, is termed \u201cCPEO plus.\u201d The core concept is that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to multi\u2010system involvement, with extraocular muscles commonly affected and with possible neurologic and cardiac manifestations. Mitochondrial diseases such as CPEO plus arise from deletions or point mutations in mitochondrial DNA, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. The tissues that demand high energy \u2013 including the extraocular muscles, basal ganglia (contributing to parkinsonism), and cardiac conduction systems \u2013 are particularly vulnerable. Unlike Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome, which usually has an onset before age 20 along with pigmentary retinopathy, CPEO plus may present later with a broader spectrum of neuromuscular involvement. In this case, the patient had onset of ocular symptoms around age 40 (manifesting as ophthalmoplegia without overt visual loss) and later developed parkinsonism, gait issues, and cardiac manifestations. This progressive, multisystem involvement fits the profile of a mitochondrial disorder with CPEO plus features rather than isolated conditions like Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy (which primarily affects central vision) or Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome (which classically has earlier onset with retinal pigmentary changes). Diagnosis is based on a careful clinical history and neurological exam. Supporting tests include serum lactate levels, muscle biopsy demonstrating ragged-red fibers, and genetic testing for mitochondrial DNA deletions. Differential diagnoses include: Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome (earlier onset with retinal pigment changes), Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy (acute central vision loss), and other mitochondrial myopathies. Electrophysiology and cardiac workup (ECG, Holter monitoring) might help assess associated cardiac conduction defects. Management is supportive and symptomatic. First-line measures include nutritional support and mitochondrial cofactors like Coenzyme Q10. Cardiac surveillance is essential; pacemaker insertion may be required if conduction defects develop. Parkinsonian features may be treated with dopaminergic agents after careful evaluation. For patients who are pregnant or lactating, medication choices should be guided by established safety profiles (e.g., avoiding drugs with mitochondrial toxicity) and multidisciplinary management is recommended with genetic counseling due to the maternal inheritance pattern of mitochondrial disorders. Option A (Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome) is less likely because KSS has an onset before age 20 and typically includes pigmentary retinopathy and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities. Option B (Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy) presents predominantly with central visual loss, not the described gradual, multisystem involvement. Option C (Chronic ophthalmoplegia plus / CPEO plus) encompasses the described ocular, cardiac, and parkinsonism features and fits the later onset, making it the best answer. Option D is not provided. 1. CPEO plus is a subset of mitochondrial diseases demonstrating both ocular and systemic symptoms. 2. The age of onset and absence of pigmentary retinopathy help differentiate CPEO plus from Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome. 3. Cardiac conduction abnormalities, even when subtle, must be evaluated in patients with suspected mitochondrial myopathies. Recent studies emphasize the utility of genetic testing and next-generation sequencing to confirm mitochondrial DNA defects. Current guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary and individualized approach, focusing on supportive care since there is no curative treatment for mitochondrial disorders.",

    "explanation": "This question targets the recognition of a mitochondrial syndrome characterized predominantly by progressive external ophthalmoplegia accompanied by multisystem involvement \u2013 specifically, proximal muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, and parkinsonism \u2013 without significant gastrointestinal symptoms. This clinical constellation is best described as CPEO plus. Mitochondrial dysfunction due to DNA deletions or mutations impairs cellular energy production, especially affecting tissues with high energy demand such as skeletal muscles, the heart, and neural structures. The resulting energy deficit leads to a progressive myopathy, and when combined with extraocular muscle and other systemic involvement, the phenotype is referred to as CPEO plus. This differs from related mitochondrial disorders like Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome which typically begin in young age with additional features like pigmentary retinopathy. The 57\u2010year\u2010old male in the question manifests progressive proximal weakness, external ophthalmoplegia, cardiomyopathy, and parkinsonism. The absence of gastrointestinal symptoms helps rule out mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE). The age at onset and pattern of organ involvement align with a diagnosis of CPEO plus rather than Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome or other mitochondrial syndromes. A thorough clinical evaluation combined with investigations such as muscle biopsy (which may reveal ragged-red fibers), measurement of serum lactate, and genetic testing (to identify mitochondrial DNA deletions) is essential. Differential diagnoses include Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome (characterized by early onset and retinal pigment abnormalities), MNGIE (notable for prominent GI dysmotility), and other forms of mitochondrial myopathy. Cardiac evaluation with ECG and echocardiogram is recommended for assessing cardiomyopathy. Management is predominantly supportive. First-line interventions include nutritional optimization, exercise, and mitochondrial supplements (e.g., Coenzyme Q10). Cardiac manifestations require regular monitoring, and patients might need pacemaker insertion if conduction abnormalities arise. Parkinsonism may be managed with dopaminergic therapy after evaluating the risk\u2013benefit ratio. In pregnant or lactating patients with mitochondrial disorders, close monitoring, genetic counseling, and careful selection of safe medications are advised to avoid potential mitochondrial toxicity. Option A (MINGE, likely referring to MNGIE) is incorrect because the hallmark of MNGIE is significant gastrointestinal dysmotility, which is absent here. Option B (CPEO plus) correctly integrates the presence of extraocular muscle involvement with proximal muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, and parkinsonism. Option C (Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome) is less likely given the late onset and lack of classic retinal findings. Option D is not provided. 1. The presence of external ophthalmoplegia with multisystem involvement in an older adult should prompt consideration of CPEO plus. 2. Absence of gastrointestinal manifestations is useful to differentiate it from MNGIE. 3. Mitochondrial disorders often require a high index of suspicion and benefit from a multidisciplinary evaluation. Recent guideline updates stress the role of advanced genetic testing in confirming mitochondrial diagnoses. Research continues into supportive therapies that may enhance mitochondrial function, while clinical management remains tailored to patient-specific involvement with careful monitoring of cardiac and neurological function.",
