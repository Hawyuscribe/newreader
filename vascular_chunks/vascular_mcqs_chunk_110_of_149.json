    "question": "A 70 year old man with Parkinson's disease who had become progressively more demented over the past year. For the past 2 months he has been having more frequent hallucinations which makes him more agitated and violent. He is on Levodopa/Carbidopa and Rivastigmine. What is the appropriate treatment?",
    "option_a": "Quetiapine",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is primarily a movement disorder, but many patients eventually develop non-motor symptoms such as psychosis and dementia. Psychosis in PD typically presents with visual hallucinations and delusions, often complicating the disease course. PD psychosis is believed to result from a combination of Lewy body pathology and the effects of dopaminergic treatment. The imbalance between various neurotransmitters, especially an overactivity of dopamine receptors in a background of cholinergic deficits, underlies the development of hallucinations and delusions. In this 70-year-old patient, the progression to dementia combined with new-onset hallucinations and agitation is a common clinical picture in PD psychosis. The patient\u2019s ongoing dopaminergic therapy (Levodopa/Carbidopa) can exacerbate psychotic symptoms, necessitating careful management. The differential diagnosis includes delirium (often secondary to other medical issues), medication-induced psychosis, and primary psychiatric disorders. A careful history, medication review, and, if necessary, neuroimaging help differentiate PD psychosis from these conditions. Diagnostic criteria are based on clinical observation and exclusion of other causes. First-line management includes reviewing and potentially reducing dopaminergic medications if possible. When an antipsychotic is needed, quetiapine is often preferred because it has a lower risk of worsening motor symptoms compared to other antipsychotics. Other agents include clozapine, which requires regular blood monitoring. More recently, pimavanserin has been approved specifically for PD psychosis. For pregnant or lactating patients (although rare in PD), the risk\u2013benefit profile of antipsychotics must be carefully evaluated, with lower-risk agents and minimal effective doses employed. Option A (Quetiapine) is correct as it is commonly used to manage psychosis in PD due to its relatively low risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Option B (Risperidone) is generally avoided because it can significantly exacerbate motor symptoms. Option C (Memantine) is used for cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and does not directly address psychosis in the context of PD. 1) Always review dopaminergic medications if new psychotic symptoms develop in PD. 2) Quetiapine is commonly chosen for PD psychosis because of its more favorable motor side-effect profile. 3) Pimavanserin is emerging as a targeted treatment for PD psychosis. Recent clinical trials have validated the efficacy of pimavanserin for PD psychosis. However, quetiapine remains widely used in clinical practice due to physician familiarity and its accessibility. Ongoing research is focusing on balancing motor and psychiatric symptoms in PD with novel therapeutic agents.",

    "question": "What is the most common cause of hereditary chorea?",
    "option_a": "Huntington disease",
    "option_b": "Sydenham chorea",
    "option_c": "Benign hereditary chorea",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Hereditary chorea refers to a group of movement disorders that are passed down genetically and present with involuntary, irregular, flowing movements known as chorea. Huntington disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene, leading to abnormal protein accumulation, neurodegeneration (especially in the striatum), and subsequent neurotransmitter imbalances (including GABA and acetylcholine deficits). This results in the characteristic choreiform movements and cognitive/psychiatric disturbances. Typically presenting in mid-adulthood, Huntington disease manifests with chorea, psychiatric symptoms (such as depression and irritability), and cognitive decline. The strong family history and autosomal dominant inheritance pattern are key clinical clues. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, family history, and confirmatory genetic testing for the HTT gene expansion. Differential diagnoses include Sydenham chorea (post-streptococcal and typically occurring in children), benign hereditary chorea (which is much rarer and less progressive), and drug-induced chorea. There is no cure for Huntington disease, so management is focused on symptomatic relief. Medications such as tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine are used to control chorea. Antipsychotics and antidepressants may be needed for psychiatric symptoms. In pregnancy, genetic counseling is vital, and the use of medications must be weighed against potential teratogenic effects; non-pharmacologic support and careful monitoring are recommended during lactation. Option A (Huntington disease) is correct and is the most common cause of hereditary chorea. Option B (Sydenham chorea) is not hereditary and is typically seen in children following a streptococcal infection. Option C (Benign hereditary chorea) is a rare, non-progressive condition and is much less common. 1) Huntington disease typically presents between 30-50 years of age with a combination of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. 2) A positive family history is a very important clue. 3) Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis by identifying the CAG repeat expansion. Current research is exploring gene-silencing therapies and other disease-modifying approaches for Huntington disease. However, treatment remains symptomatic, and ongoing studies aim to improve quality of life and delay progression.",

    "question": "A 68-year-old male presented to the clinic due to history of recurrent falls. He has history of CABG 6 months ago. Physical examination showed limited vertical gaze, bradykinesia, and unsteady gait.\nBrain MRI showed generalized atrophy with ex-vacuo and atrophy of midbrain tectum (no image was shown).\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "option_a": "Vascular parkinsonism (VP)",
    "option_b": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)",
    "option_c": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)",
    "option_d": "Multisystem atrophy (MSA)",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is an atypical parkinsonian syndrome characterized by postural instability, falls, and supranuclear gaze palsy (especially marked by impaired vertical gaze). PSP is a tauopathy, where abnormal accumulation of tau protein leads to neurodegeneration in specific brain regions including the basal ganglia and brainstem (especially the midbrain tectum). The degeneration of vertical gaze centers leads to the characteristic limitation of vertical eye movement. In an elderly patient presenting with early falls, bradykinesia, and especially limited vertical gaze, PSP is a strong diagnostic consideration. The history of recurrent falls combined with the specific MRI finding of midbrain atrophy further supports this diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include vascular parkinsonism (which usually lacks vertical gaze palsy), normal pressure hydrocephalus (characterized by magnetic gait, urinary incontinence, and dilated ventricles on imaging), and multisystem atrophy (which more typically involves marked autonomic dysfunction and cerebellar features). MRI findings in PSP, such as midbrain atrophy (\u2018hummingbird sign\u2019), are very helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Management of PSP is largely supportive. First-line strategies include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and fall prevention measures. The response to dopaminergic medications is generally poor. There are no disease-modifying therapies currently available. In the context of pregnancy or lactation, although rare in PSP due to the typical age of onset, management would continue to be supportive with a focus on safety and minimizing adverse effects of any medications prescribed. Option A (Vascular parkinsonism) typically presents with lower body parkinsonism and does not usually include vertical gaze palsy. Option B (Progressive supranuclear palsy) is correct as it best explains the combination of recurrent falls, bradykinesia, and vertical gaze limitations combined with MRI findings. Option C (Normal pressure hydrocephalus) is characterized by a triad including gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive decline along with ventriculomegaly on imaging. Option D (Multisystem atrophy) usually includes significant autonomic dysfunction and cerebellar features, which are not prominent in this case. 1) Vertical gaze palsy, especially affecting downward gaze, is a hallmark of PSP. 2) Early falls and postural instability in an elderly patient with parkinsonian features should raise suspicion for PSP. 3) MRI findings showing midbrain atrophy or a 'hummingbird sign' are supportive of the diagnosis. Recent clinical research in PSP is focused on tau-targeted therapies, although no robust disease-modifying treatments have yet been established. Meanwhile, multidisciplinary supportive care remains the cornerstone of management.",

    "question": "Patient presented with ipsilateral tremor and Horner syndrome and contralateral complete loss of pain and temperature sensation. Normal vibration and position sensation. Where is the localization?",
    "option_a": "Upper Pons",
    "option_b": "Lower Pons",
    "option_c": "Dorsolateral Midbrain",
    "option_d": "Ventral Midbrain",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question tests brainstem localization by linking a classic cross\u2010finding \u2013 ipsilateral cranial signs with contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation \u2013 to the anatomy of the brainstem. In this case, involvement of ipsilateral tremor (suggestive of disruption of cerebellar or red nucleus circuits) along with Horner syndrome (indicating disruption of descending sympathetic fibers) points toward a lesion in the lateral/dorsolateral region, where these pathways run close together. A lesion in the dorsolateral midbrain tegmentum can damage the red nucleus or its associated circuits (resulting in tremor, for example a Holmes\u2019 tremor) and the descending sympathetic fibers that travel in the lateral aspect, leading to Horner syndrome. Simultaneously, involvement of the spinothalamic tract (which decussates near the midline) results in contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation while sparing the dorsal columns (responsible for vibration and proprioception). Patients typically present with a combination of ipsilateral motor abnormalities (tremor) and sympathetic dysfunction (Horner syndrome) along with contralateral deficits in pain and temperature sensation. The intact vibration and proprioception confirm that the medial lemniscus/dorsal columns are not involved. This constellation is most consistent with a lesion in the dorsolateral midbrain rather than in the pons. Differentiating this lesion from other cross\u2010syndromes involves a careful neurological exam. For example, lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome also produces contralateral pain/temperature loss with ipsilateral Horner syndrome but is generally associated with additional features such as dysphagia and vertigo. Lateral pontine syndromes usually include facial nerve involvement or hearing loss. MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging is the gold standard for localization of brainstem infarcts or demyelinating lesions. Management depends on the underlying etiology. If vascular (e.g., an infarct), acute management includes thrombolysis if within the window, antiplatelet agents, and control of risk factors. Neurorehabilitation is essential for functional recovery. In cases related to demyelination, corticosteroids may be considered. Pregnancy and lactation considerations require using medications that have been verified as safe (for instance, aspirin and other antiplatelets in low doses can be used with caution, but thrombolytic protocols in pregnancy are high-risk and require multidisciplinary consultation). Option A (Upper Pons): Typically presents with other signs such as facial weakness or internuclear ophthalmoplegia, not the described combination. Option B (Lower Pons): While the lower pons contains some sympathetic fibers, it usually would produce additional findings (e.g., facial nerve deficits) which are not described. Option C (Dorsolateral Midbrain): Correct answer because it best explains the ipsilateral tremor, Horner syndrome, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation. Option D (Ventral Midbrain): Lesions here tend to affect the oculomotor nerve (leading to oculomotor palsy) and the corticospinal tract (producing hemiparesis), which is not described in this scenario. 1. Holmes\u2019 tremor, a coarse tremor seen in midbrain lesions, can be combined with other localizing signs such as Horner syndrome. 2. The presence of crossed sensory/motor findings always warrants a careful search for brainstem lesions. 3. Intact dorsal column functions help narrow down the lesion to a lateral location where the spinothalamic tract is affected. Recent neuroimaging studies, particularly high-resolution MRI, have improved our ability to precisely localize brainstem lesions. Updated stroke management guidelines emphasize early recognition and imaging to optimize outcomes, and the principles of neuroanatomical localization remain a key part of neurological assessment.",

    "question": "Patient known case of Parkinson disease on levodopa/carbidopa describing having recurrent tremor and bradykinesia before the next dose. What is the description of this phenomenon?",
    "option_a": "Off dystonia",
    "option_b": "On and off phenomena",
    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question focuses on the motor fluctuations seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease secondary to levodopa therapy. Specifically, it describes the re-emergence of Parkinsonian symptoms (tremor and bradykinesia) before the next dose, which is a classic example of a medication \u2018wearing\u2010off\u2019 phenomenon \u2013 a type of on\u2013off fluctuation. Over time in Parkinson\u2019s disease, the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons reduces the buffering capacity for dopamine. As a result, the duration of response to each levodopa dose becomes shorter, leading to predictable periods of motor symptoms (off phases) before the next dose. This phenomenon is a hallmark of advanced disease and reflects pharmacokinetic/dynamic changes. Patients typically report a predictable recurrence of symptoms such as tremor and slowness as the effect of their levodopa dose wanes. This is distinct from off dystonia, which usually presents as painful dystonic posturing, and from unpredictable fluctuations known as the on\u2013off phenomenon. In the clinic, a detailed medication history and symptom diary can help distinguish wearing-off phenomena from other complications. Differential diagnoses include off dystonia (characterized primarily by dystonic posturing) and dyskinesia (involuntary movements occurring at peak dosing). Close temporal correlation with levodopa dosing confirms the diagnosis. Initial management includes optimizing the levodopa dosing schedule \u2013 for example, by increasing the dosing frequency or using extended-release formulations. Adjunctive medications such as COMT inhibitors (e.g., entacapone) or MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline) can help extend the duration of levodopa\u2019s effect. In pregnancy and lactation, levodopa is generally considered the safest dopaminergic therapy, but any medication changes should involve multidisciplinary consultation to balance maternal and fetal safety. Option A (Off dystonia) is incorrect because off dystonia typically presents as painful muscle contractions rather than tremor and bradykinesia. Option B (On and off phenomena) is correct because the described recurrence of symptoms before the next dose is the classic wearing-off component of the on\u2013off fluctuations seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Options C and D are not provided or are blank. 1. Wearing-off phenomena indicate the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease and a need to adjust the therapeutic regimen. 2. A careful medication schedule review and patient diary are critical to differentiate between various motor fluctuations. 3. Levodopa remains the cornerstone of therapy; adjustments are essential for managing complications such as wearing-off. Recent studies continue to refine the management of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease with motor fluctuations. New extended-release formulations and fast-acting delivery systems are under investigation, and current guidelines recommend individualized adjustments based on patient response and side-effect profiles.",

    "question": "Which of the following Parkinsonian disorders commonly presented with asymmetrical features?",

    "option_b": "PSP",
    "option_c": "CBD",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question tests the recognition of the pattern of asymmetry often seen in atypical parkinsonian disorders. Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is classically known for its asymmetric presentation compared to other parkinsonian syndromes such as MSA (multiple system atrophy) or PSP (progressive supranuclear palsy), which usually present with more symmetric findings. CBD is characterized by a tauopathy with asymmetric deposition of abnormal tau protein that results in cortical and basal ganglia dysfunction. The asymmetric neurodegeneration leads to unilateral or markedly asymmetrical motor and cognitive symptoms. Clinically, patients with CBD present with asymmetric rigidity, apraxia, and often an 'alien limb' phenomenon. In contrast, MSA and PSP tend to have bilateral, symmetric involvement. This distinction aids in the differentiation among Parkinson-plus syndromes. Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation and neuroimaging. While idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease also typically starts asymmetrically, the progressive cortical signs (e.g., apraxia, alien limb phenomenon) distinguish CBD from other parkinsonian disorders. Differential diagnoses include idiopathic PD, MSA, and PSP. MRI may show asymmetric cortical atrophy in CBD. There is no disease\u2010modifying treatment for CBD; management is primarily supportive and symptomatic. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies are the mainstays of treatment. Dopaminergic therapy is often less effective than in idiopathic PD. In the context of pregnancy or lactation (if applicable, though CBD usually occurs in older adults), supportive care and non-pharmacologic interventions would be emphasized due to limited data on the safety of many neuroactive agents. Option A (MSA) generally presents with symmetric autonomic and motor findings. Option B (PSP) tends to cause symmetric axial rigidity and early falls. Option C (CBD) is correct because it is the parkinsonian disorder that most characteristically shows marked asymmetry in motor involvement. Option D is blank. 1. An \u2018alien limb\u2019 phenomenon is a high-yield clinical clue for CBD. 2. Unlike idiopathic PD, CBD is typically poorly responsive to levodopa. 3. Asymmetry in motor deficits is a key feature that differentiates CBD from other atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Recent research has focused on tau-directed therapies in CBD, though these are not yet in routine clinical practice. Current guidelines emphasize early and accurate differentiation among Parkinson-plus syndromes to tailor supportive therapies appropriately.",

    "question": "Elderly patient presented with peak dose dyskinesia that is bothering him and affects his daily living activities. He known case of Parkinson disease and maintained on levodopa/carbidopa 4 times/day. Otherwise he is doing well and has recurrence of the Parkinsonian features just 30 minutes before the next dose. Which of the following is the appropriate management?",

    "option_b": "Add Amantadine",
    "option_c": "Switch to levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone.",
    "option_d": "?? (was wrong)",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question addresses the management of motor complications in Parkinson\u2019s disease, particularly peak-dose dyskinesia \u2013 involuntary movements occurring at the peak concentration of levodopa. The patient also experiences wearing-off phenomena as he has Parkinsonian symptoms 30 minutes before the next dose. Peak-dose dyskinesia arises due to high plasma levels of levodopa leading to excessive dopaminergic stimulation. Chronic levodopa therapy results in pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors, which over time contributes to the development of dyskinesias. Concurrent wearing-off symptoms are due to the diminishing duration of action of levodopa as the disease progresses and dopaminergic storage capacity decreases. Patients with peak-dose dyskinesia experience involuntary, erratic movements during the peak medication window, which can interfere with daily activities. The reemergence of Parkinsonian symptoms shortly before the next dose indicates a wearing-off phenomenon. The management challenge is to reduce dyskinesias without exacerbating off symptoms. The clinical history is key: noting the timing of dyskinesia in relation to levodopa dosing helps distinguish peak-dose dyskinesia from other motor fluctuations (e.g., off dystonia). Differential diagnosis includes levodopa-induced dyskinesias versus other movement disorders. A careful review of medication timing and dosages is essential. The first-line management for peak-dose dyskinesia is the addition of amantadine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, which has been shown to reduce dyskinetic movements. Adjusting the levodopa dosing schedule (e.g., dividing doses more evenly throughout the day) may also be beneficial. Although COMT inhibitors (e.g., entacapone) are useful for reducing wearing-off, they can increase dyskinesias by raising overall dopaminergic stimulation, and thus are less appropriate in a patient whose primary complaint is peak-dose dyskinesia. In pregnant or lactating patients, treatment decisions must weigh maternal benefits and fetal safety; levodopa is generally considered relatively safe, while the use of amantadine would require careful consideration of current safety data and guidelines. Option A (Add Selegiline) would prolong the effect of levodopa and might help with wearing-off, but it does not reliably reduce peak-dose dyskinesia and may even worsen dyskinetic movements. Option B (Add Amantadine) is correct because amantadine has strong evidence in reducing peak-dose dyskinesias. Option C (Switch to levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone) may reduce wearing-off but can exacerbate dyskinesia due to increased levodopa bioavailability. Option D is not provided. 1. Amantadine is the preferred adjunct therapy for managing peak-dose dyskinesia in Parkinson\u2019s disease. 2. Adjustment of levodopa dosing (by increasing frequency or decreasing individual dose) can help balance the dual issues of wearing-off and dyskinesia. 3. Always consider the trade-off: measures that reduce off time can sometimes worsen dyskinesias. Recent guidelines emphasize individualized therapy for managing levodopa-induced motor complications. Studies have demonstrated that amantadine can significantly reduce peak-dose dyskinesia without a major negative impact on Parkinsonian symptoms. Ongoing research into continuous dopaminergic stimulation and alternative delivery systems aims to further minimize these complications.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This scenario involves a patient with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease who has developed dementia and now exhibits agitation. In Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia, psychotic symptoms such as agitation may occur. The mainstay is to use an antipsychotic that minimizes worsening of motor symptoms while addressing behavioral issues. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to motor and non\u2010motor problems. Chronic therapy with dopaminergic medications, as well as neurodegenerative changes, can lead to an imbalance in neurotransmitter systems, contributing to psychosis and agitation. Atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine act on multiple receptors with less potent D2 antagonism, reducing the risk of exacerbating motor symptoms. The patient presents with agitation in the context of PD dementia and is already on dopaminergic therapy (levodopa/carbidopa) as well as rivastigmine for cognitive symptoms. The agitation likely represents a neuropsychiatric complication of PD rather than a primary psychiatric illness, so the treatment choice must not worsen his motor function. Evaluation involves a thorough review of medications, ruling out systemic causes (e.g., infections, metabolic disturbances) for behavioral changes, and differentiating PD dementia with psychosis from primary psychiatric disorders. Differential diagnoses include delirium, Alzheimer's, and drug-induced psychosis. Clinical assessment and careful medication review remain paramount. The management of PD psychosis is a tiered approach: first, review and possibly reduce dopaminergic medications if feasible; if symptoms persist, initiate an atypical antipsychotic. Quetiapine is often preferred due to its low risk of worsening motor symptoms. Clozapine is an alternative but requires close monitoring for agranulocytosis. For pregnant or lactating patients, risk\u2010benefit discussions are essential as quetiapine is generally considered Category C, meaning that it should be used if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. Option A (Quetiapine) is correct because it has a lower propensity to exacerbate Parkinsonian symptoms. Option B (Risperidone) has a higher risk of worsening motor symptoms due to strong D2 receptor antagonism; Option C (Memantine) is primarily used for cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and is not indicated for agitation in PD. 1. In PD patients, psychosis is best managed with low-dose atypical antipsychotics; quetiapine is frequently used. 2. Always review PD medication regimens when new neuropsychiatric symptoms emerge. 3. Clozapine, while effective, needs intensive monitoring due to its hematologic risks. Recent guidelines continue to support the use of low-dose atypical antipsychotics in managing PD-associated psychosis. Ongoing research is focused on finding therapies that better balance efficacy in treating agitation with minimal motor side effects. The integration of non-pharmacologic interventions and medication adjustments remains a cornerstone of patient management.",

    "explanation": "The case presents with classical triad symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The levodopa responsiveness test is considered a cornerstone in confirming the diagnosis of PD. Parkinson\u2019s disease is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal loss, particularly in the substantia nigra, leading to disturbance in the basal ganglia circuits. This results in motor symptoms which are typically reversible with dopaminergic therapy, creating a functional biomarker for the disease. The patient\u2019s motor signs (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia) strongly hint at PD. A trial of levodopa/carbidopa is used not only to alleviate symptoms but also to substantiate the diagnosis based on the presence of a significant clinical improvement. Differential diagnosis includes essential tremor, drug-induced parkinsonism, and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. The levodopa challenge distinguishes idiopathic PD from other causes; a positive response is strongly supportive of PD. The first-line diagnostic and therapeutic test is a trial of levodopa/carbidopa. For women who are pregnant or lactating, the use of levodopa/carbidopa should be carefully considered, but evidence suggests cautious use if benefits outweigh the potential risks, though PD in pregnancy is rare. Option A (Levodopa/carbidopa trial) is correct as it not only treats the symptoms but also serves as a diagnostic tool. Option B (PET scan) is not routinely recommended in the early or typical diagnostic workup of Parkinson\u2019s disease due to cost and the clear clinical diagnosis based on history and physical examination. 1. A robust response to levodopa is a diagnostic hallmark of Parkinson\u2019s disease. 2. Levodopa/carbidopa testing also serves a therapeutic role in alleviating motor symptoms. 3. Always consider and rule out other mimickers such as essential tremor or drug-induced conditions. Current clinical guidelines continue to underscore the importance of a levodopa challenge in the diagnostic workup of PD. Advanced imaging modalities are reserved for atypical presentations or research settings, with clinical response remaining the gold standard.",

    "explanation": "Functional tremor is a type of functional (or psychogenic) movement disorder. Its management primarily revolves around non-pharmacologic interventions such as psychotherapy, which addresses underlying psychological factors contributing to the tremor. The exact mechanism of functional tremor is not fully understood; however, it is believed to be related to abnormal central nervous system processing and altered sensorimotor integration influenced by psychological stressors. This results in physical manifestations that are inconsistent and variable. Patients with functional tremor typically display variability in tremor frequency and amplitude, often demonstrating improvement with distraction or when engaging in tasks. This contrasts with organic tremors which usually have a consistent pattern. Differentials include essential tremor, Parkinson\u2019s disease-related tremor, and enhanced physiological tremor. Functional tremor is distinguished by features such as distractibility, entrainment, and inconsistency, often confirmed by specific clinical tests during neurological examination. The first line of management for functional tremor is psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), along with multidisciplinary approaches that may include physical therapy. These non-pharmacologic interventions are especially safe and preferred during pregnancy and lactation owing to the absence of medication-related risks. Option A (Propranolol) is commonly used for tremors of organic origin such as essential tremor but is not effective in functional tremor. Option B (Psychotherapy) is correct as it addresses the underlying psychological factors driving the tremor. 1. Improvement of tremor with distraction is a key diagnostic clue for a functional tremor. 2. A multidisciplinary approach including CBT and physical therapy is vital for management. 3. Functional tremor is often a diagnosis of exclusion after organic causes have been ruled out. Recent research reinforces the effectiveness of psychotherapy, particularly CBT, in treating functional neurological disorders. Guidelines now emphasize the importance of early identification and non-pharmacologic management to reduce chronicity and improve outcomes.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "The diagnosis of functional tremor relies on clinical features that differ from organic tremors. One hallmark is the improvement of tremors with distraction, supporting a diagnosis of a functional (psychogenic) disorder rather than an inherent neurological pathology. Functional tremor arises from disturbed neural processing and abnormal movement control linked to psychological factors rather than structural brain abnormalities. The disorder is thought to result from maladaptive neuroplastic changes in response to stress or emotional factors. In practice, patients with functional tremor often exhibit tremor characteristics that are inconsistent and vary with attention. A decrease in tremor amplitude when the patient is distracted is a classic clinical sign that supports the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes essential tremor, parkinsonian tremor, and enhanced physiological tremor. Diagnostic clues such as distractibility, entrainment (the tremor frequency altering to match a voluntary rhythmic movement), and variability help differentiate functional tremor from these conditions. Management involves reassurance, education, and psychotherapy, particularly CBT, aiming to address underlying psychological issues. In addition, physical therapy may be beneficial. These approaches are inherently safe for pregnant and lactating patients, avoiding pharmacologic complications during these periods. Option A (Distraction of the patient improves the tremors) is correct because improvement with distraction is a well-documented feature of functional tremor. Option B (Manipulation of the other hand improves the tremor) is not a standard diagnostic test and is less established in the evaluation of functional tremors. 1. Functional tremors are highly variable and improve with distraction, which is a key distinguishing feature. 2. A multidisciplinary therapeutic approach is essential for optimal outcomes. 3. Non-pharmacologic treatment modalities such as CBT and physical therapy are first-line. Current studies continue to validate the diagnostic utility of distractibility in functional tremor assessments. Recent guidelines emphasize the importance of psychotherapy and other non-pharmacologic strategies, while research is ongoing to better elucidate the neurobiological underpinnings of functional neurological disorders.",

    "explanation": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado\u2010Joseph disease, is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by progressive cerebellar ataxia. It is one of the most common types of spinocerebellar ataxias and can include a spectrum of motor symptoms including gait ataxia, dysarthria, and ocular abnormalities such as ophthalmoplegia. Blurry vision may occur related to ocular motor dysfunction. SCA3 is caused by an abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene, leading to an elongated polyglutamine tract. The mutant protein misfolds and aggregates in neurons, causing degeneration in the cerebellum, brainstem, and other regions of the central nervous system. This neurodegenerative process underlies the progressive motor deficits, including ataxia and impaired eye movements. Patients typically develop symptoms in mid-adulthood. The presence of ataxia along with ophthalmoplegia (difficulty moving the eyes) and related visual disturbances fits with the clinical features of SCA3. Visual complaints, such as blurry vision, may be secondary to impaired extraocular muscle control. The differential diagnosis should include other spinocerebellar ataxias (like SCA2 or SCA6), ataxia with ocular apraxia (which is usually characterized by difficulty initiating eye movements rather than true ophthalmoplegia), and even conditions like Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy in the appropriate clinical context. Genetic testing for CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN3 gene is confirmatory for SCA3. Currently, there is no cure or disease\u2010modifying treatment for SCA3. Management is mainly supportive, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and management of complications. Genetic counseling is essential. For patients who are pregnant or lactating, supportive care remains the mainstay, and no specific teratogenic medications are typically used in the symptomatic management of SCA3. Option A (SCA3) is correct. Option B (Ataxia with ocular apraxia) typically presents with oculomotor apraxia rather than ophthalmoplegia and has an earlier onset. Option C ('Laber') is not a recognized entity in neurology. 1. SCA3 (Machado\u2010Joseph disease) is the most common autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide. 2. Ophthalmoplegia in SCA3 can lead to symptoms such as diplopia and blurry vision. 3. Genetic testing is the key to confirming the diagnosis. Recent studies continue to focus on understanding the molecular pathogenesis of polyglutamine disorders like SCA3 and investigate potential neuroprotective and gene-targeted therapies, though current management remains supportive.",

    "explanation": "Lithium is a cornerstone mood stabilizer, particularly used in the management of bipolar disorder. It has a narrow therapeutic window and a range of side effects that clinicians monitor. Lithium's mechanism involves modulation of second messenger systems, such as inhibition of inositol monophosphatase, which alters intracellular signaling. Its impact on various organ systems contributes to its side effect profile, with tremor being one of the most common adverse effects. Patients on lithium frequently experience a fine tremor, especially of the hands. This side effect can be dose-related and may improve with dose adjustments or with beta-blocker therapy. Monitoring of lithium levels is essential to balance efficacy with toxicity. When evaluating a patient with tremor, the clinician should differentiate between lithium-induced tremor, essential tremor, or tremor due to other medications or systemic conditions such as hyperthyroidism. A detailed medication history and assessment of thyroid function are important. First-line management includes dose adjustment and, if needed, the addition of beta-blockers (such as propranolol) to control the tremor. Regular monitoring of thyroid, renal function, and lithium levels is recommended. In pregnancy, lithium is associated with a risk of congenital cardiac malformations (Ebstein anomaly) but may be continued with close monitoring if the benefit outweighs the risk. During lactation, lithium is excreted in breast milk, and careful risk-benefit discussion is warranted. Option A (Tremor) is correct because tremor is the most frequent and common side effect observed in patients treated with lithium. Other side effects, though significant (e.g., thyroid dysfunction, renal impairment), are not as commonly reported as tremor. 1. Lithium-induced tremor is dose-dependent and can often be managed with beta-blockers. 2. Regular monitoring of thyroid and renal function is critical in patients on long-term lithium therapy. 3. The therapeutic window for lithium is narrow, necessitating frequent level checks. Recent guidelines emphasize the importance of monitoring lithium serum levels and organ functions. Beta-blockers remain the mainstay for managing lithium-induced tremor, and current research continues to evaluate strategies to minimize lithium toxicity while preserving its mood-stabilizing effects.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Thalamotomy is a neurosurgical procedure used to create a lesion in a specific part of the thalamus. In Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), it is primarily used to target tremor, especially when medical management is insufficient. The thalamus, particularly the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus, is integral to the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway involved in tremor generation. Lesioning the VIM interrupts abnormal oscillatory activity, thereby reducing tremor. Patients with PD who have severe, medication-refractory tremor often benefit from thalamotomy. While tremor improves significantly, other motor symptoms of PD, such as bradykinesia and rigidity, are not markedly affected by this procedure. The differential for surgical management of PD includes deep brain stimulation (DBS), especially when multiple motor symptoms are present. Thalamotomy is specifically indicated for tremor-dominant PD, whereas DBS (targeting the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus) may address bradykinesia and rigidity as well. First-line surgical management for medication-refractory tremor in PD may include thalamotomy or DBS. Thalamotomy is typically reserved for patients with significant tremor and those who may not be candidates for DBS. In women of childbearing potential or during pregnancy, surgical interventions are generally deferred unless absolutely necessary, due to anesthesia-related and procedural risks. Lactating women also require careful evaluation regarding anesthesia and post-operative care. Option A (Tremor) is correct because thalamotomy (targeting the VIM of the thalamus) is effective in reducing tremor. Option B (Bradykinesia) is incorrect as thalamotomy does not significantly improve bradykinesia or rigidity in PD. 1. Thalamotomy is particularly beneficial for patients with tremor-predominant PD who are unresponsive to medication. 2. Lesioning procedures are irreversible, which makes patient selection critical. 3. DBS has largely supplanted thalamotomy in many centers but remains an option in select scenarios. Recent literature supports thalamotomy for tremor control in select PD patients. However, deep brain stimulation has become more popular due to its adjustability and reversibility, although thalamotomy remains a valuable option when DBS is contraindicated.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Levodopa-induced dyskinesia is a common complication in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) treated over the long term with levodopa. It involves involuntary, erratic, and often distressing movements. The pathogenesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesia is multifactorial. It is largely attributed to pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors due to intermittent dosing of levodopa, leading to maladaptive plasticity, glutamatergic hyperactivity, and sensitization of postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Amantadine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, helps reduce this glutamatergic overactivity. In a PD patient with a 6-year history on levodopa, the emergence of dyskinesia represents a common progression of the disease\u2019s treatment complications. Clinically, these dyskinetic movements can be socially and functionally disabling, prompting modification of the therapeutic regimen. The differential diagnosis includes other medication-induced movement disorders and off-period dystonia. A careful history to correlate the timing of dyskinetic movements with levodopa dosing is critical in confirming levodopa-induced dyskinesia. First-line management involves addressing dyskinesia without compromising overall motor control. Amantadine is recommended as the first-line agent to reduce dyskinesias. Adjustments such as switching to controlled-release formulations of levodopa, fractionating doses, or even adding dopamine agonists might be considered second-line. In pregnancy, the use of amantadine requires careful risk-benefit analysis (it is generally a Category C drug), while during lactation the potential exposure through breast milk necessitates caution and close monitoring. Option A (decrease Levodopa dose) could reduce dyskinesia but at the risk of worsening parkinsonian symptoms. Option B (Amantadine) is correct as it directly addresses the mechanism of dyskinesia. Option C (Levodopa and entacapone) may help with wearing-off phenomena but does not specifically address dyskinesia. Option D (Pramipexole) is a dopamine agonist more suited for early PD management and is not the first choice for treating established dyskinesia. 1. Amantadine is the only drug with proven efficacy in reducing levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD. 2. Reducing levodopa too much can lead to worsening of motor symptoms, underscoring the need for balance in management. 3. Dyskinesia management often involves a delicate balance between controlling involuntary movements and maintaining adequate motor function. Recent studies have reinforced the role of amantadine, including extended-release formulations, in reducing dyskinesia severity in PD patients. Current guidelines advocate for its use while emphasizing individualized therapy and careful monitoring of both motor function and dyskinesia severity.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Essential Tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder characterized by a bilateral, postural or action tremor, predominantly affecting the hands and forearms. A key clinical clue is that the tremor often improves with alcohol intake and frequently has a positive family history, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Although the precise mechanism is not fully understood, current evidence points toward dysfunction in cerebellar outflow pathways and abnormalities in GABAergic neurotransmission. Studies have also highlighted genetic factors, with familial cases suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in many patients. Patients typically present with tremors that are most prominent during voluntary movement (action/postural) and may have difficulty performing precise tasks. The marked improvement with alcohol and the presence of a family history favor the diagnosis of Essential Tremor over other tremor disorders such as enhanced physiologic tremor or Parkinson\u2019s disease (which is typically a rest tremor). The diagnosis is primarily clinical. Differential diagnoses include: Enhanced Physiologic Tremor (which is usually more subtle and lacks a familial pattern), Parkinson\u2019s Disease (characterized mainly by rest tremor and other motor findings), and dystonic tremor (accompanied by irregular postures). A thorough history, neurological exam, and sometimes tremor analysis help differentiate these conditions. First-line treatment options include beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) and primidone. If first-line medications are not effective or tolerated, alternative agents (topiramate, gabapentin) may be used. In refractory cases, deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the thalamus is an option. In pregnancy and lactation, medication choice should be carefully considered: beta-blockers may be used with caution while primidone is generally contraindicated due to teratogenicity. Option A (Essential Tremor) is correct given the clinical clues of alcohol responsiveness and a positive family history. Option B (Enhanced Physiologic Tremor) is less likely because it does not typically improve with alcohol nor does it usually have a familial pattern. Options C and D are not provided. 1. Essential Tremor is the most common movement disorder, often with a familial autosomal dominant pattern. 2. Tremor improvement with alcohol is a distinguishing clinical feature. 3. Beta-blockers and primidone remain the mainstays of treatment. Recent research has focused on cerebellar dysfunction and the role of abnormal oscillatory activity in ET. There is also increasing interest in the genetic underpinnings of the disorder, and neuromodulatory therapies such as DBS are being refined for patients with medically refractory symptoms.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Huntington Disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative condition that manifests with a triad of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric abnormalities. It is classically characterized by choreiform movements (dance-like involuntary movements), cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. The disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene on chromosome 4, leading to an abnormal huntingtin protein. This mutated protein causes neurotoxicity, particularly affecting the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen), resulting in neuronal dysfunction and death. The process also disrupts multiple neurotransmitter pathways, including GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic systems. Patients often develop chorea \u2013 abrupt, involuntary, dance-like movements \u2013 along with progressive cognitive deterioration and behavioral changes such as irritability, depression, or apathy. The typical age of onset is between 30 and 50 years old, and family history is usually positive due to its autosomal dominant inheritance. The differential diagnosis includes Sydenham chorea (post-streptococcal), Wilson\u2019s disease (hepatic dysfunction with Kayser-Fleischer rings), and benign hereditary chorea. Definitive diagnosis is made via genetic testing demonstrating the expanded CAG repeats. Neuroimaging may show atrophy of the caudate nucleus with enlarged lateral ventricles. There is no cure; treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine can help control chorea, though they must be used cautiously due to side effects like depression and parkinsonism. Antipsychotics may be used for severe behavioral symptoms. In pregnancy and lactation, the risks and benefits of these medications need careful evaluation, and genetic counseling is essential for family planning. Option A (Huntington disease) is correct because it directly explains the triad of chorea, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes described in the question. The other options are not provided, but conditions like Sydenham chorea or Wilson\u2019s disease would not fit the full clinical picture. 1. Huntington Disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with anticipation. 2. CAG repeat expansion correlates with the severity and age of onset of the disease. 3. Symptom management is multidimensional, often requiring a combination of pharmacologic and supportive therapies. Recent clinical trials are exploring gene silencing techniques (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides) as potential disease-modifying therapies. Multidisciplinary management remains key, with emphasis on addressing both motor and psychiatric symptoms to improve overall quality of life.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "In Parkinson's Disease, cognitive decline and hallucinations can be components of Parkinson Disease Dementia (PDD). This syndrome typically occurs in patients with established motor symptoms and is characterized by deficits in executive function and visuospatial abilities along with neuropsychiatric manifestations like visual hallucinations. PDD results from the widespread deposition of Lewy bodies (alpha-synuclein aggregates) not only in the substantia nigra but also in cortical regions. The cholinergic deficit that ensues is a major contributor to the dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in these patients. A patient with PD who develops memory impairment and hallucinations is likely experiencing a progression to Parkinson Disease Dementia. The hallucinations are often visual, and their presence alongside forgetfulness reinforces the diagnosis rather than indicating a separate psychotic disorder. The differential diagnosis includes Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), where cognitive decline and hallucinations occur concurrently with or prior to motor symptoms, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, and medication-induced psychosis. Taking a careful history regarding the chronology of symptom onset helps differentiate PDD from these conditions. Rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is FDA-approved for the treatment of cognitive impairment in PDD and is considered first-line therapy for managing the cognitive and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms. It can modestly improve attention, executive function, and even reduce hallucinations in some cases. Antipsychotic agents (like clozapine or quetiapine) may be considered if psychotic symptoms are prominent and do not respond to cholinesterase inhibitors; however, they pose a risk of worsening motor function. In pregnancy and lactation, the use of cholinesterase inhibitors like rivastigmine is generally avoided unless absolutely necessary due to potential risks, and a careful risk-benefit analysis is required. Option A (Rivastigmine) is correct because it specifically addresses the cognitive decline in PDD. While clozapine (Option B in some listings) is used off-label for hallucinations in Parkinson\u2019s patients, rivastigmine is the approved treatment for dementia in PD. The choice between these agents depends on the dominant symptoms, but in a case with both forgetfulness and hallucination, rivastigmine is typically preferred as first-line therapy. 1. Rivastigmine is the only cholinesterase inhibitor specifically approved for Parkinson Disease Dementia. 2. In managing hallucinations, consider reviewing and adjusting dopaminergic therapies first. 3. Differentiating PDD from Dementia with Lewy Bodies hinges largely on the timing of cognitive decline relative to motor symptoms. Recent studies have confirmed the modest benefits of rivastigmine on cognition and behavior in PDD. Research continues into other cholinesterase inhibitors and newer agents such as pimavanserin for Parkinson\u2019s psychosis, although careful management is required to balance motor and psychiatric symptoms.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia (PKD) is a disorder characterized by sudden, brief episodes of involuntary movements, which can manifest as dystonia, chorea, or a combination. These episodes are typically triggered by sudden voluntary movements or changes in activity, such as turning while running. PKD is believed to result from transient dysfunction in basal ganglia circuitry. Many cases are linked to mutations in the PRRT2 gene, supporting a genetic etiology. This disorder is thought to involve abnormal neuronal excitability and ion channel dysregulation, leading to paroxysmal dyskinesias. The patient\u2019s episodes \u2013 jerky movements of the upper limb followed by dystonic posturing triggered by a change in movement \u2013 are classic for PKD. The family history of migraine is also a recognized association in some families with PKD, reflecting shared genetic pathways in paroxysmal disorders. The main differential diagnoses include exercise-induced dyskinesia, paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, and epileptic seizures. Unlike epileptic seizures, PKD episodes are very brief, lack loss of consciousness, and are closely associated with movement triggers. A detailed history, neurological examination, and sometimes genetic testing (for PRRT2 mutations) aid in diagnosis. First-line treatment for PKD is typically low-dose anticonvulsants, with carbamazepine being the drug of choice. Other drugs such as phenytoin or oxcarbazepine may be used if carbamazepine is not tolerated. In pregnancy, carbamazepine is classified as Category D in the first trimester (with known teratogenic risks) and should be used after careful risk-benefit analysis; close monitoring and consultation with obstetrics are essential. Option B (Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia) is correct as it best fits the description of sudden, movement-triggered episodes with dystonic features. Option A (Exercise related dyskinesia) implies dyskinesia induced by prolonged exercise rather than the sudden, brief episodes seen in PKD. Options C and D are not provided, making Option B the most accurate diagnosis. 1. PKD episodes are very brief, usually lasting seconds, and are reliably triggered by sudden movement. 2. A history of migraine in the family can be a useful clinical clue in PKD. 3. Carbamazepine is the first-line treatment for controlling PKD episodes. Recent genetic studies have confirmed the association of PKD with mutations in the PRRT2 gene. There is ongoing research into the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying paroxysmal dyskinesias, and newer anticonvulsants continue to be evaluated for efficacy and safety in PKD management.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Orthostatic tremor is a rare movement disorder characterized by a feeling of unsteadiness or shaking in the legs when standing still. The tremor is high-frequency (typically 13\u201318 Hz) and is usually relieved by movement, allowing patients to walk normally once they initiate walking. The underlying mechanism is not completely understood, but evidence points toward a central oscillator dysfunction located in brainstem or cerebellar pathways. Abnormal neuronal synchronization is thought to produce the high-frequency rhythmic contractions seen on electromyography (EMG) when the patient is standing. Patients typically present with a sensation of unsteadiness or trembling in the legs while standing, often accompanied by a fear of falling. Notably, these symptoms improve or vanish upon walking or sitting down. This differentiates orthostatic tremor from other gait disorders where imbalance is continuous regardless of posture. The diagnosis is confirmed by surface EMG of the leg muscles while the patient is standing, which demonstrates the characteristic high-frequency tremor. Differential diagnoses include ataxic syndromes (often associated with cerebellar lesions), primary gait disorders (e.g., due to neuropathy or musculoskeletal issues), and psychogenic gait disorders. A careful neurologic examination helps differentiate these conditions. The first-line treatment is pharmacologic therapy with clonazepam, which has shown benefit in reducing tremor amplitude and improving stability. Gabapentin and other anti-epileptics are considered second-line. There are no specific pregnancy or lactation contraindications noted with clonazepam when benefits outweigh risks; however, caution is warranted given benzodiazepines\u2019 potential neonatal effects, so alternative management strategies should be considered in pregnant or lactating women. Option A (Ataxic syndrome) is incorrect because ataxia typically presents as continuous coordination problems, not the transient unsteadiness solely on standing. Option B (Orthostatic Tremor) correctly corresponds with the patient\u2019s complaint of unsteadiness only during standing that resolves upon walking. Options C and D were not provided. 1. Orthostatic tremor is rare and best diagnosed using surface EMG during the symptomatic standing period. 2. Patients note improvement of symptoms when initiating movement. 3. Clonazepam is the primary treatment though management remains challenging. Recent studies support the role of high-frequency EMG in definitively diagnosing orthostatic tremor. Although a rare condition, updated reviews continue to recommend clonazepam as a first-line treatment, with ongoing research into alternative therapeutic options.",
