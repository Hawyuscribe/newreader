    "explanation": "In the management of brain tumors that are causing significant neurological symptoms or mass effect, early surgical referral is paramount. Surgical resection not only alleviates symptoms by reducing intracranial pressure, but it also provides tissue for definitive histopathological diagnosis, which is essential for tailoring further treatment. Brain tumors, depending on their type and location, can produce a mass effect that compresses adjacent brain tissue and causes edema. This leads to increased intracranial pressure and subsequent neurological deficits. Early surgical resection in accessible tumors may halt or reverse these processes and allows for proper staging based on tissue diagnosis. Patients typically present with headaches, focal neurological deficits, or seizures when mass effect is significant. The choice of surgery is based on alleviating symptoms, confirming pathology, and potentially improving long\u2010term prognosis by decreasing tumor burden. The workup includes neuroimaging \u2013 most commonly MRI with contrast \u2013 to evaluate tumor size, location, and relation to neural structures. Differential diagnoses include high\u2010grade gliomas, metastases, lymphomas, and benign lesions such as meningiomas. Definitive diagnosis requires tissue sampling. According to recent neurosurgical guidelines, the first\u2010line management for accessible brain tumors with significant clinical manifestations is surgical resection. The tiered approach is: 1) Referral to neurosurgery for resection and tissue diagnosis; 2) Consideration of adjuvant therapies (radiotherapy or chemotherapy) based on the histopathological diagnosis; 3) Adjunct use of steroids to manage peritumoral edema. In the context of pregnancy or lactation, surgical management may be pursued with appropriate obstetric consultation and perioperative care to minimize fetal risk while prioritizing maternal neurological stability. Option 1, which advocates for surgical resection (i.e., a referral to surgery), is the correct step. Options suggesting immediate radiotherapy or chemotherapy are inappropriate since histological confirmation is essential before initiating these treatments. Observation alone could result in clinical deterioration, and while steroids help control edema, they do not provide a definitive treatment. The marked answer 'C' does not align with this rationale, making 'A' the correct option. 1) Surgical resection is both diagnostic and therapeutic in managing brain tumors. 2) Early intervention in symptomatic, mass\u2010effect lesions can prevent irreversible neurological damage. 3) Always secure a tissue diagnosis before initiating definitive adjuvant treatments. Recent studies and clinical guidelines continue to support early neurosurgical intervention for accessible brain tumors. Multidisciplinary care that includes neurology, neurosurgery, and oncology is key in optimizing outcomes, and current evidence underscores the importance of individualized treatment planning even in complex cases such as those involving pregnancy.",

    "subspecialty": "Neuro-oncology",
    "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by the development of multiple central nervous system tumors. It is particularly noted for its association with both intracranial and spinal tumors. NF2 is caused by mutations in the NF2 gene on chromosome 22, which codes for the tumor suppressor protein merlin. Loss of merlin function leads to abnormal cell growth and predisposes patients to develop bilateral vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas, including tumors located in the spinal cord and posterior fossa. Patients with NF2 often present with hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance disturbances due to bilateral vestibular schwannomas. They may also develop spinal cord tumors, which can manifest as radiculopathy or motor/sensory deficits. The involvement of posterior fossa structures further supports the diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria (including family history and characteristic lesions on MRI) and genetic testing for NF2 mutations. Differential diagnoses include NF1 (which has a distinct clinical presentation with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and cutaneous neurofibromas) and von Hippel-Lindau disease (typically associated with hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinoma). Management primarily involves regular surveillance with MRI imaging to monitor tumor growth. Indications for surgical intervention include symptomatic lesions or tumors that threaten neurological function. Radiosurgery is an option for smaller lesions. In pregnancy and lactation, management requires careful planning since hormonal changes may influence tumor growth; multidisciplinary consultation with neurology, neurosurgery, and obstetrics is crucial. Option A (NF type 2) is correct because this syndrome is classically associated with tumors in the spinal cord and posterior fossa. Option B (VHL) is more associated with hemangioblastomas (primarily in the retina and cerebellum) and renal neoplasms, while Option C (NF type 1) typically presents with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules, and cutaneous neurofibromas rather than posterior fossa tumors. 1) Bilateral vestibular schwannomas are pathognomonic for NF2. 2) NF2 should be considered in patients presenting with both spinal and intracranial tumors. 3) Differentiating NF2 from NF1 is key for appropriate monitoring and management. Current guidelines emphasize early MRI screening for patients with suspected NF2 due to the risk of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other CNS tumors. Advances in genetic testing and targeted therapies are under investigation to improve outcomes for NF2 patients.",

    "question": "A 45-year-old patient presents with progressive headaches and neurological deficits. MRI brain sagittal view shows a large extra-axial mass with a dural tail sign. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "option_d": "Astrocytoma",
    "option_e": "Ependymoma",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuro-oncology",
    "explanation": "Meningiomas arise from the arachnoid cap cells of the meninges and are typically benign extra-axial tumors. They are known for their relationship to the dura, which commonly leads to the appearance of a 'dural tail sign' on contrast-enhanced MRI. The growth of meningiomas is generally slow but they can exert mass effect on adjacent brain structures, leading to neurological symptoms. Their extra-axial location and well-circumscribed margins allow for the classic imaging appearance. The dural tail is due to reactive changes in the adjacent dura. Patients generally present with insidious onset of symptoms such as headaches, seizures, or focal neurological deficits depending on the tumor's location. The extra-axial nature and the dural tail sign seen on MRI are highly suggestive of a meningioma. The diagnostic workup includes MRI with gadolinium contrast which typically shows a well-circumscribed mass with a dural tail. Differential diagnoses include metastases (which may be multiple and lack a dural tail), dural-based lymphomas, and other extra-axial lesions. Histopathologic confirmation post-resection remains the gold standard. First-line management for symptomatic meningiomas is surgical resection. Observation may be chosen for small, asymptomatic lesions. In cases where complete resection is not feasible or in recurrence, stereotactic radiosurgery may be used. In pregnant patients, management is often deferred until postpartum if the lesion is asymptomatic, with close monitoring during pregnancy. Option B is correct because an extra-axial mass with a dural tail sign is most characteristic of a meningioma. The other options are less fitting: Glioblastoma multiforme and astrocytoma are intra-axial and typically infiltrative, metastases usually lack the classic dural tail and may present with multiple lesions, and ependymoma is generally intraventricular or in the spinal region. 1) The 'dural tail sign' is a radiologic hallmark of meningiomas. 2) Most meningiomas are benign and amenable to complete surgical resection. 3) A thorough workup to differentiate extra-axial from intra-axial lesions is essential in brain tumor evaluation. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and surgical techniques have improved the safety and efficacy of meningioma resection. Current guidelines support individualized treatment plans and the use of radiosurgery for residual or recurrent tumors.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuro-oncology",
    "explanation": "In pediatric neuro-oncology, the posterior fossa is a common site for brain tumors. The two primary tumors in this region are pilocytic astrocytomas, which are typically benign, and medulloblastomas, which are malignant. The incidence of these tumors varies, with pilocytic astrocytoma generally being the most common overall in children. Pilocytic astrocytomas are low-grade, well-circumscribed tumors that often present with a cystic component and a mural nodule. In contrast, medulloblastomas are highly malignant embryonal tumors that tend to rapidly grow and may disseminate via cerebrospinal fluid pathways. Children with posterior fossa tumors often present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, ataxia, and headache. Pilocytic astrocytomas usually have a more indolent course, while medulloblastomas present more aggressively with a higher propensity for spread. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice. Pilocytic astrocytomas often appear as cystic lesions with an enhancing mural nodule, whereas medulloblastomas are typically solid and hyperdense on CT with homogeneous contrast enhancement. Differential diagnoses may include ependymoma, which usually arises around the fourth ventricle. For pilocytic astrocytoma, which is the most common benign tumor in the posterior fossa of children, the first-line treatment is surgical resection, often curative if a complete resection can be achieved. Medulloblastomas, on the other hand, require a multimodal approach involving surgery, craniospinal irradiation, and chemotherapy. In pediatric patients, the impact on development is considered, and in the rare event of a pregnant patient, delaying treatment until postpartum may be considered if clinically safe, with multidisciplinary input from neuro-oncology and obstetrics. The marked answer 'B' (Medulloblastoma) is incorrect in the context of overall incidence. Although medulloblastoma is the most common malignant posterior fossa tumor in children, pilocytic astrocytoma is the most frequent posterior fossa tumor overall. Option A (Pilocytic Astrocytoma) is therefore the correct answer, while Option C (Ependymoma) is less common. 1) Pilocytic astrocytomas are typically slow-growing, benign tumors with excellent outcomes following gross-total resection. 2) Medulloblastomas, while common in the posterior fossa, represent the most common malignant subtype. 3) Differentiating between these tumors on imaging is vital for appropriate management. Recent epidemiological studies confirm that pilocytic astrocytomas are the most common posterior fossa tumors in children. Advances in pediatric neuro-oncology continue to refine surgical and adjuvant treatment strategies, emphasizing minimizing long-term neurocognitive sequelae while optimizing survival.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuro-oncology",
    "explanation": "Meningiomas are the most common benign intracranial tumors, originating from the arachnoid cap cells of the meninges. They account for approximately 30-40% of all primary brain tumors and are often discovered incidentally or when they become large enough to cause symptoms due to mass effect. These tumors generally exhibit slow growth and are usually classified as WHO Grade I. They may show genetic alterations such as NF2 gene inactivation. Hormonal influences are also implicated, given their higher prevalence in females. Their location along the dural surfaces often produces characteristic imaging findings such as the 'dural tail sign'. While many meningiomas are asymptomatic, when symptoms do appear they depend on the tumor\u2019s location. Common presentations include headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits, or other signs related to compression of nearby neural structures. Their slow growth allows for gradual clinical progression in many cases. Diagnosis is primarily by neuroimaging. MRI with contrast is the modality of choice, showing a well-circumscribed, extra-axial mass with homogeneous enhancement and often a dural tail. Differential diagnoses include schwannomas, epidermoid cysts, or other extra-axial lesions. CT scans might also be used to assess calcifications or bone involvement. Management is based on the size, location, and symptoms. For asymptomatic, small meningiomas, observation with periodic imaging is often appropriate. Symptomatic or enlarging tumors generally warrant surgical resection, which can be curative. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an option for residual tumor or tumors in difficult locations. In pregnant patients, management is tailored to the urgency and symptoms, with careful monitoring and minimizing exposure to radiation, whereas lactating women can continue treatment provided the chosen modality is safe. Option A (Meningiomas) is correct because they are by far the most common benign intracranial neoplasm. Option B (Glioma) is incorrect because gliomas are typically malignant tumors (with the exception of some low-grade variants) and do not represent the most common benign intracranial tumor. Options C and D were not provided. 1. The 'dural tail sign' on contrast-enhanced imaging is a hallmark of meningiomas. 2. Many meningiomas are discovered incidentally and require no treatment unless they cause symptoms. 3. They are more common in females, likely due to hormonal influences. Recent studies emphasize the role of advanced neuroimaging for detailed assessment and planning of surgical resection. Additionally, research into molecular profiling is emerging to better predict tumor behavior, influencing both prognosis and management strategies.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuro-oncology",
    "explanation": "A frontal lobe lesion in a male with behavioral changes, especially one exhibiting heterogeneous enhancement on MRI, is highly suspicious for a neoplastic process. Neoplastic lesions in the frontal lobe often affect personality and behavior, and subsequent management requires tissue diagnosis. Frontal lobe tumors disrupt the normal function of the prefrontal cortex, leading to behavioral changes or personality disturbances. Heterogeneous enhancement suggests variable tumor consistency with areas of necrosis or hemorrhage and is frequently seen in high-grade neoplasms such as glioblastomas. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier results in irregular contrast uptake on imaging. Patients with frontal lobe tumors commonly present with subtle changes in behavior, executive dysfunction, and sometimes seizures or focal deficits depending on the tumor's size and exact location. In this scenario, the absence of clear seizure activity directs initial management toward surgical evaluation rather than antiepileptic therapy. After identifying the lesion on MRI, the primary diagnostic goal is to obtain a tissue diagnosis. The differential includes high-grade gliomas (like glioblastoma), primary central nervous system lymphoma, metastases, and even abscesses. Further evaluation with advanced imaging modalities (e.g., MR spectroscopy) and then neurosurgical biopsy or resection is typically indicated. The immediate next step is referral to neurosurgery for further evaluation, including planning for a biopsy or surgical resection to obtain a definitive histological diagnosis. Only after confirmation of the tumor type will further treatment (e.g., radiotherapy, chemotherapy with agents such as temozolomide) be planned. The use of antiepileptic drugs (such as Valproate) should be reserved for patients who develop seizures. In pregnant or lactating patients, management involves tailored imaging (favoring MRI without contrast when possible) and multidisciplinary discussion to balance maternal and fetal risks. Option A (Referral to Neurosurgery) is correct because neurosurgical evaluation is essential for lesions with suspicious imaging characteristics to confirm the diagnosis and determine the next therapeutic steps. Option B (initiating Valproate for seizure control) is inappropriate in this context, as there is no clear evidence of seizures, and prophylactic antiepileptic use is not recommended without seizure activity. Options C and D were not provided. 1. Frontal lobe lesions often present with subtle behavioral changes even in the absence of seizures. 2. Heterogeneous enhancement on MRI is a red flag, necessitating tissue diagnosis through neurosurgical evaluation. 3. Seizure prophylaxis is not indicated unless the patient has clinical seizures. Recent guidelines in neuro-oncology stress early neurosurgical referral for patients with suspicious brain lesions to secure a histological diagnosis, which is essential for proper management planning. Advances in molecular diagnostics are increasingly influencing individualized treatment decisions, especially for high-grade tumors.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most common myopathy in patients older than 50 years. It is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, predominantly affecting the proximal muscles (especially the quadriceps) and the deep finger flexors. IBM is unique among inflammatory myopathies due to its dual degenerative and inflammatory components. Muscle biopsies often reveal endomysial inflammation, rimmed vacuoles, and amyloid deposits. This pattern reflects both an autoimmune process and a degenerative process with protein misfolding. Clinically, IBM presents with insidious onset of weakness, often leading to difficulties with activities such as rising from a chair, climbing stairs, or performing fine motor tasks. The age group affected is typically over 50 years, with a slight male predominance. Its presentation differentiates it from other myopathies that tend to occur in younger individuals. Diagnosis is made by integrating clinical findings with supportive investigations including electromyography (EMG) and definitive muscle biopsy findings. Differential diagnoses include polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and hereditary muscular dystrophies. The characteristic biopsy findings with rimmed vacuoles and inclusions confirm IBM. Management of IBM is largely supportive. Physical therapy and occupational therapy are critical to maintain mobility and function. Immunosuppressive therapies have generally shown limited benefit. Although the typical patient is beyond the reproductive age, in the rare instance of pregnancy or lactation, therapies should prioritize non-pharmacological interventions to avoid exposure of the fetus or nursing infant to potentially harmful medications. Option A (IBM) is the correct answer because IBM is the most prevalent myopathy in patients older than 50 years. Option B (Dermatomyositis) is more typically seen in younger patients and is associated with distinct skin manifestations. Options C (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) and D (Becker muscular dystrophy) are genetic disorders that usually present in childhood or adolescence. IBM should be suspected in older patients with slow progressive muscle weakness, particularly when the quadriceps and finger flexors are involved. The resistance of IBM to immunosuppressive treatments distinguishes it from other inflammatory myopathies. Recent literature supports the view that IBM is refractory to most immunomodulatory agents, with current research focusing on novel approaches targeting protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Rehabilitation remains the cornerstone of therapy.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "None of the above",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "This patient\u2019s history of progressive, proximal lower limb weakness with a positive family history in both brothers and sisters and consanguinity between his parents is characteristic of an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder, most consistent with a limb\u2010girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) of the recessive type. In autosomal recessive conditions, affected individuals are homozygous for the mutant allele, while unaffected spouses are presumed to be homozygous normal, leading to all offspring inheriting one mutant allele, hence being carriers but not manifesting the disease. LGMD (recessive forms, often designated LGMD2) results from mutations in genes that encode proteins of the muscle fiber membrane complex (e.g., dystroglycans, sarcoglycans). Mutations lead to structural instability of the muscle fibers, causing progressive muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase levels due to ongoing muscle fiber breakdown. Patients typically present with slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness (difficulty standing from a sitting position, climbing stairs) during adolescence or early adulthood. The moderately elevated CK (e.g., 2800) supports a myopathic process. A family history of similarly affected siblings, with both sexes involved and evidence of parental consanguinity, reinforces an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Evaluation involves clinical assessment, serum CK measurement, electromyography (EMG), and ultimately, genetic testing and muscle biopsy when indicated. Differential diagnoses include other forms of muscular dystrophy (including autosomal dominant LGMD subtypes) and metabolic myopathies, but the family history and consanguinity strongly point to an autosomal recessive process. Management is supportive and multidisciplinary, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and regular cardiac and respiratory evaluations. Genetic counseling is crucial. For pregnancy and lactation, management involves liaising with high\u2010risk obstetrics. Although the affected parent (genotype aa) will pass on a mutant allele to every child, if the partner is a phenotypically normal and noncarrier individual (genotype AA), all offspring will be heterozygous carriers (Aa) and clinically unaffected. Thus, the risk of having an affected child is 0%. Counseling should also cover the possibility of an increased carrier rate in communities with high consanguinity. The provided answer choices (50% normal, 25% normal, 25% carrier, 50% affected) do not capture the expected genetic outcome. In autosomal recessive inheritance when an affected individual (aa) mates with a normal noncarrier (AA), each offspring will invariably be a carrier (Aa) and none will be affected. Therefore, the answer 'None of the above' is correct. \u2022 Consanguinity is a key clue for autosomal recessive disorders. \u2022 In autosomal recessive conditions, an affected individual always passes one mutant allele; if the mate is not a carrier, all offspring are carriers but none manifest disease. \u2022 Genetic counseling is essential, particularly in populations with high consanguinity and when planning a pregnancy. Recent guidelines emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to managing LGMD, with emerging research into targeted molecular therapies. Current genetic counseling recommendations stress confirming the carrier status of the partner to accurately assess recurrence risks, especially in the context of consanguineous communities. Pregnancy management requires coordinated care between neuromuscular specialists and high\u2010risk obstetric teams to monitor both maternal neuromuscular function and potential obstetrical complications.",

    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "The case describes a young adult with a 10\u2010year history of progressive proximal lower limb weakness, difficulty standing from a seated position, markedly elevated CK (2800 U/L), and a positive family history (brother and sister affected). In evaluating proximal muscle weakness with high CK, the possibilities include primary myopathies. However, the chronic course and familial involvement favor an inherited myopathy (muscular dystrophy) over an acquired inflammatory myopathy. Muscular dystrophies result from genetic mutations affecting proteins that maintain muscle membrane integrity (eg, dystrophin, sarcoglycans, calpain). These defects lead to ongoing muscle fiber degeneration, necrosis, and fibrosis with consequent leakage of muscle enzymes (eg, CK). Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) in particular can follow autosomal dominant or recessive patterns and presents with predominantly proximal weakness. The patient\u2019s decade-long history of progressive proximal weakness with difficulty rising from a chair and a familial pattern (involving both genders) is most consistent with an inherited muscular dystrophy such as LGMD. In contrast, an inflammatory myopathy like polymyositis is usually an acquired, nonfamilial condition, and other options like SMA, myasthenia gravis, or AIDP do not explain the high CK and chronic familial course. Key steps include obtaining a detailed history (onset, progression, family history), measuring serum CK levels, and performing electromyography (EMG) which typically shows a myopathic pattern. Confirmation requires muscle biopsy and genetic testing. Differential diagnoses include inflammatory myopathy (polymyositis/dermatomyositis), which is typically sporadic and may have systemic features, and spinal muscular atrophy, a motor neuron disorder (with a different EMG profile and usually only mild CK elevation). Management of muscular dystrophy is largely supportive. It involves a multidisciplinary approach including physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and flexibility, orthopedic interventions for contractures, and regular cardiac and pulmonary evaluations. Although no curative treatment exists, emerging gene therapies are under investigation. Pregnancy and lactation require special attention with coordinated obstetric and neuromuscular monitoring, as physiologic stress may exacerbate muscle weakness and complicate respiratory or cardiac status. There are no immunosuppressive treatments indicated, unlike in inflammatory myopathies. Option A (Inflammatory myopathy) can present with proximal weakness and high CK but is typically acquired and not familial. Option B (Spinal Muscular Atrophy) is an inherited motor neuron disorder; however, it usually has only mildly elevated CK and shows denervation on EMG. Option C (Myasthenia Gravis) manifests with fluctuating weakness (often with ocular involvement) and normal CK. Option D (AIDP) is an acute demyelinating neuropathy that does not follow a chronic course or exhibit high CK levels. None of these options correctly capture the diagnosis of an inherited muscular dystrophy, most likely a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. \u2022 In young patients with chronic, progressive proximal weakness, always inquire about family history. Elevated CK levels into the thousands are more suggestive of a dystrophic process rather than an acquired inflammatory myopathy. \u2022 EMG findings that are myopathic and a muscle biopsy showing dystrophic changes support the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy. \u2022 Always consider genetic testing for definitive diagnosis. \u2022 In managing these patients during pregnancy and lactation, a multidisciplinary approach is essential. Recent guidelines and studies emphasize the role of genetic characterization for precise subclassification of muscular dystrophies. While there are established supportive measures, research into gene therapy is ongoing. Current consensus recommends individualized management plans with collaboration among neurology, cardiology, pulmonology, rehabilitation, and obstetrics teams for pregnant or lactating patients.",

    "explanation": "This question describes a patient with hand stiffness that worsens with exercise and cold exposure. Paramyotonia congenita is a skeletal muscle channelopathy characterized by paradoxical myotonia that is exacerbated by repeated activity and cold, in contrast to other myotonias where a warm\u2010up phenomenon is seen. Paramyotonia congenita is most commonly caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene that encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel in skeletal muscle. These mutations alter the inactivation properties of the sodium channel, leading to sustained depolarization. Cold exposure further disrupts channel kinetics, worsening the myotonia and leading to muscle weakness. Patients typically present with episodic hand stiffness that may evolve into weakness during episodes \u2013 especially when triggered by exercise or exposure to cold temperatures. Unlike myotonia congenita (Thomsen or Becker types), which characteristically shows improvement with repeated activity (warm-up phenomenon), paramyotonia congenita demonstrates worsening with exercise. Diagnosis is supported by clinical history, physical examination, and electromyography (EMG) demonstrating myotonic discharges. Genetic testing confirming SCN4A mutations can firmly establish the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include myotonia congenita (which improves with exercise), other channelopathies, and metabolic myopathies. Management focuses on avoidance of known triggers such as cold exposure and strenuous exercise. Pharmacologic treatment with sodium channel blockers like mexiletine is considered first-line to reduce myotonia. Other agents such as lamotrigine may be used. In pregnancy and lactation, treatment requires caution; mexiletine is used with careful risk\u2013benefit assessment and close monitoring under specialist advice. Option A (Paramyotonia congenita) is correct because the clinical features described \u2014 worsening stiffness and weakness with exercise and cold \u2014 are pathognomonic for this condition. Option B (Myotonia congenita) is incorrect as it typically exhibits a warm-up phenomenon and is less sensitive to cold. 1) Cold exposure exacerbates myotonia in paramyotonia congenita, unlike in myotonia congenita where exercise improves symptoms. 2) EMG is very useful in demonstrating myotonic discharges. 3) Avoidance of triggers is a key non-pharmacologic management strategy. Recent studies have reinforced the role of mexiletine in managing myotonia due to sodium channel mutations, with evidence supporting its efficacy in reducing stiffness. Updated guidelines emphasize trigger avoidance and individualized therapies based on genetic testing results.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "The case of a middle-aged female with lower limb stiffness, primarily affecting the hip muscles and presenting with lumbar hyperlordosis is highly suggestive of stiff person syndrome (SPS), an autoimmune neurological disorder. SPS is predominantly an autoimmune condition where antibodies (most commonly anti-GAD, and in some paraneoplastic cases, anti-amphiphysin) target proteins in the GABAergic system. This autoimmune attack reduces GABA synthesis, leading to diminished inhibitory control over motor neurons and resulting in continuous muscle contraction and stiffness. Patients with SPS classically present with axial muscle stiffness and rigidity, particularly affecting the proximal muscles and lower back. Lumbar hyperlordosis is a compensatory postural adaptation due to the continuous contraction of the paraspinal muscles. The detection of anti-GAD antibodies typically supports the diagnosis, though anti-amphiphysin may be present especially in paraneoplastic variants, often seen in women. The diagnosis is supported by clinical presentation alongside serological tests showing anti-GAD antibody positivity. Differential diagnoses include conditions featuring rigidity such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or spasticity from upper motor neuron lesions, but these usually have additional neurological signs. EMG may reveal continuous motor unit activity. Paraneoplastic work-up is recommended if anti-amphiphysin antibodies are detected. First-line treatment involves benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) to enhance GABAergic transmission and reduce rigidity. Baclofen may be used as adjunctive therapy. For refractory cases, immunomodulatory approaches like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or rituximab are considered. In paraneoplastic SPS, treating the underlying malignancy is crucial. Pregnancy and lactation require particular care: benzodiazepines should be used at the lowest effective dose after careful risk\u2013benefit assessment, and IVIG is generally acceptable with appropriate monitoring. Option A (Anti-GAD and amphiphysin) is correct as these antibodies are classically associated with SPS. Anti-GAD antibodies are most common in idiopathic SPS, whereas anti-amphiphysin antibodies are frequently seen in the paraneoplastic variant. Other options were not provided. 1) SPS typically presents with progressive stiffness mainly in the axial and proximal muscles, leading to hyperlordosis. 2) Anti-GAD antibodies are the most common serologic marker in SPS. 3) Early diagnosis and immunotherapy can significantly improve patient outcomes. Recent literature supports the utility of benzodiazepines and IVIG in SPS management, with growing evidence on the effectiveness of rituximab for refractory cases. Current guidelines stress early immunologic evaluation and treatment, and emphasize screening for underlying malignancies in patients with paraneoplastic antibody profiles.",

    "explanation": "The presentation of a 22-year-old male with generalized weakness following heavy exercise, associated with hypotonia and areflexia, raises suspicion for an episode of periodic paralysis, most likely triggered by an electrolyte imbalance such as hypokalemia. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is commonly precipitated by triggers like heavy exercise, high carbohydrate intake, or stress, resulting in a transient drop in serum potassium. The low potassium impairs muscle membrane repolarization, leading to decreased excitability of muscle fibers and subsequent weakness. The acute onset of generalized weakness, hypotonia, and reduced reflexes following strenuous physical exertion is typical for hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Such episodes are often reversible with normalization of the potassium level and avoidance of known triggers. Immediate evaluation with a serum potassium (K level) measurement is crucial. Differential diagnoses include Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (which presents with ascending weakness and areflexia but has a different time course and often associated with sensory changes), myasthenia gravis (typically involves fluctuating weakness without marked areflexia), and central causes where brain imaging might be warranted. The rapid assessment of electrolyte abnormalities is key. The first-line approach is to assess and correct the serum potassium imbalance with careful potassium supplementation, while monitoring cardiac and neuromuscular status. Long-term management involves avoidance of triggers. In cases of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, treatment of the underlying thyroid dysfunction is essential. During pregnancy and lactation, potassium supplementation is generally safe; however, dosing must be carefully monitored, and any underlying disorder (such as thyrotoxicosis) managed with therapies that are safe for both the mother and fetus. Option A ('K level') is correct because checking the potassium level is the essential and immediate diagnostic step given the clinical context. The other options (CT brain, LP, Toxicology screen) are not indicated in this scenario as there are no signs suggestive of central nervous system pathology or toxin ingestion. 1) Always consider electrolyte disturbances, especially hypokalemia, in patients with acute weakness after heavy exercise. 2) A simple serum potassium test can rapidly confirm the diagnosis of periodic paralysis. 3) Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is an important differential, particularly in predisposed populations. Recent guidelines and studies emphasize early recognition of electrolyte-induced paralysis. There is robust evidence that prompt potassium correction can rapidly reverse symptoms, and current research continues to explore the genetic underpinnings of periodic paralysis, informing more precise long-term management strategies.",

    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "The patient presents with a constellation of findings including difficulty drinking with a straw, proximal weakness, scapular winging, and impaired foot dorsiflexion. These key features point towards a muscular dystrophy that involves the face and shoulder girdle, which is most consistent with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). FSHD is a genetic disorder characterized by contractions of the D4Z4 repeat on chromosome 4q35, leading to aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene. The toxic gain-of-function effect of DUX4 causes progressive muscle fiber degeneration, typically affecting the facial muscles, scapular stabilizers, and eventually other muscle groups. The inability to drink with a straw indicates facial weakness, while scapular winging is a classic sign of weakness in the muscles that stabilize the scapula. Proximal weakness and impaired foot dorsiflexion signify that the disease can extend to involve other muscle groups over time. These features collectively point towards FSHD and help distinguish it from other muscular dystrophies. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and confirmed by genetic testing for D4Z4 repeat contraction on chromosome 4q35. Differential diagnoses include limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), which primarily affects the shoulder and pelvic muscles but typically spares the face, and myasthenia gravis, which presents with fluctuating weakness and does not characteristically cause scapular winging. There is no definitive cure for FSHD; treatment is primarily supportive and includes physical and occupational therapies aimed at maintaining muscle strength and function. Progressive muscle weakness may eventually require assistive devices. In pregnancy and lactation, supportive management continues to be the mainstay as there are no disease-modifying therapies; genetic counseling is recommended for family planning. Option A (Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy) is correct because the presence of facial weakness (difficulty drinking with a straw) combined with scapular winging is highly characteristic of FSHD. Option B (Limb girdle muscular dystrophy) is incorrect since LGMD typically spares facial muscles and does not usually present with scapular winging. 1) Facial weakness with scapular winging is pathognomonic for FSHD. 2) FSHD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and often has a slowly progressive course. 3) Genetic testing is key for confirming the diagnosis and guiding counseling. Ongoing research in FSHD focuses on the regulation of DUX4 expression and its role in muscle pathology. Current guidelines underscore a multidisciplinary model for management involving physical therapy, assistive devices, and genetic counseling with emerging therapies under investigation.",

    "explanation": "Stiff-person syndrome is an autoimmune neurological disorder classically associated with anti-GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) antibodies. The condition often coexists with other autoimmune diseases, particularly type 1 diabetes mellitus, underscoring the link between autoimmunity and neurological dysfunction. Anti-GAD antibodies target glutamic acid decarboxylase, the enzyme responsible for converting glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter. The reduced GABA levels lead to disinhibition of motor neurons, resulting in continuous muscle firing and the characteristic axial and peripheral muscle stiffness seen in these patients. Patients typically present with fluctuating stiffness predominantly affecting axial muscles, with associated painful spasms that can extend to the limbs. The association with type 1 diabetes further supports the diagnosis because many patients with stiff-person syndrome have a concurrent autoimmune condition. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating elevated anti-GAD antibody titers. Differential diagnoses include disorders such as tetanus, dystonia, and other movement disorders. Clinical history, serological testing, and electromyographic studies (which may demonstrate continuous motor unit activity) help differentiate stiff-person syndrome from these conditions. First-line treatment involves symptomatic therapy with benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) to enhance GABAergic transmission. Second-line treatments include baclofen and, in refractory cases, immunotherapies such as IVIG or plasmapheresis. In pregnant or lactating patients, benzodiazepines should be used cautiously due to potential neonatal sedation and withdrawal; consultation with maternal\u2013fetal medicine is recommended, and IVIG remains a relatively safe immunomodulatory option during pregnancy. Option A (Anti-GAD) is correct because it directly correlates with the pathogenesis of stiff-person syndrome in the context of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Option B (Anti-MAG) is incorrect as anti-MAG antibodies are typically linked with demyelinating peripheral neuropathies rather than the hyperexcitability seen in stiff-person syndrome. 1. Stiff-person syndrome is most commonly associated with anti-GAD antibodies and type 1 diabetes mellitus. 2. Benzodiazepines not only relieve muscle stiffness but also help prevent painful spasms. 3. Electrophysiologic studies can show continuous motor unit activity even at rest. Recent studies and guidelines underscore the role of immunotherapy (IVIG, plasmapheresis) in patients with severe or refractory symptoms, and emerging research is focusing on targeted immune modulation. The autoimmune associations continue to be a key area of translational research in stiff-person syndrome.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction. The hallmark is fluctuating muscle weakness, primarily due to antibodies that impair neuromuscular transmission. In MG, autoantibodies (commonly anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies) bind to receptors at the neuromuscular junction, impairing synaptic transmission. Single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) measures neuromuscular jitter and is extraordinarily sensitive in detecting these transmission abnormalities. Patients with MG typically present with fatigable muscle weakness, which often starts with ocular manifestations (ptosis and diplopia) and may progress to bulbar and limb weakness. The fluctuating nature of symptoms, with worsening on exertion, is characteristic. The differential diagnosis includes other neuromuscular transmission disorders such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and congenital myasthenic syndromes. SFEMG is the most sensitive diagnostic test, particularly in cases where serological antibody tests (e.g., anti-AChR) may be negative (seronegative MG). Routine nerve conduction studies and repetitive nerve stimulation also assist in diagnosis but are less sensitive compared with SFEMG. First-line management includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., pyridostigmine) to improve neuromuscular transmission. For generalized MG or refractory cases, immunosuppressive agents (corticosteroids, azathioprine) are used. Thymectomy may be considered in patients with thymoma or in generalized MG. In pregnancy, pyridostigmine is generally safe, but immunosuppressants require careful risk\u2013benefit assessment, and thymectomy is contraindicated during pregnancy. Option A (Single fiber EMG) is correct as it is the most sensitive test to diagnose MG due to its ability to detect increased neuromuscular jitter. Option B (Antibodies) is less sensitive because a subset of patients (seronegative MG) may have negative antibodies despite clinical disease. 1. SFEMG remains the gold standard for detecting transmission defects in MG. 2. Clinical fluctuations and fatigability are key features of MG. 3. Even in the absence of detectable antibodies, a diagnosis of MG should not be excluded if SFEMG is positive. Current clinical guidelines reinforce the role of SFEMG in the diagnostic workup of MG, especially in seronegative cases. Recent research is exploring novel biomarkers and imaging techniques to complement traditional testing methods.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "The case describes a young male with external ophthalmoplegia and ptosis beginning before the age of 10. This clinical presentation strongly suggests a mitochondrial cytopathy, with Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) being the prototypical disorder. Kearns-Sayre syndrome is caused by large-scale deletions in mitochondrial DNA, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. This multisystem disorder typically affects tissues with high energy demands, such as extraocular muscles, leading to ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. Additional features, though not mentioned in the stem, can include pigmentary retinopathy and cardiac conduction defects. The early onset of ptosis and ophthalmoplegia is highly characteristic of KSS. While oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) also causes ptosis, its onset generally occurs in adulthood (usually after the fourth decade) and is less likely to be accompanied by complete external ophthalmoplegia. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation supported by ancillary testing such as muscle biopsy (which shows ragged red fibers) and mitochondrial DNA analysis. Differential diagnoses include OPMD, which usually presents later in life and primarily causes ptosis and dysphagia without the multisystem involvement seen in KSS. Management is largely supportive and focuses on monitoring and mitigating complications. Cardiac conduction abnormalities necessitate regular screening and may warrant pacemaker insertion if indicated. Endocrine and ophthalmologic involvement should be evaluated periodically. In pregnancy and lactation, management is supportive, with careful cardiac and metabolic monitoring as mitochondrial disorders can complicate gestation. Option A (Kearns-Sayre syndrome) is correct because the early onset of external ophthalmoplegia and ptosis aligns with the typical presentation of this mitochondrial disorder. Option B (OPMD) is incorrect because it characteristically presents in later adulthood and lacks the extramuscular manifestations common to KSS. 1. Kearns-Sayre syndrome typically presents before age 20 with a triad of symptoms: chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and cardiac conduction defects. 2. OPMD should be considered in cases of isolated ptosis with later onset. 3. Multisystem involvement in KSS requires a multidisciplinary management approach. Recent updates highlight the importance of genetic testing in confirming mitochondrial disorders. Multidisciplinary care remains the cornerstone, and emerging therapies are under investigation to address mitochondrial dysfunction, though none has replaced supportive care.",

    "explanation": "Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN) is a variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) characterized by a primary axonal involvement of motor nerves. It is immune-mediated and often linked with antecedent infections, most notably Campylobacter jejuni. In AMAN, autoantibodies (commonly anti-GM1) and complement deposition lead to direct axonal injury of motor nerves, bypassing the demyelinating process seen in the more classic AIDP variant of GBS. This results in rapid motor weakness without significant sensory deficits. Clinically, AMAN presents with rapid-onset, predominantly motor weakness that may progress quickly to respiratory failure in severe cases. The relative preservation of sensory function differentiates it from other polyneuropathies. Early recognition is critical for initiating appropriate therapy. Electrophysiological studies in AMAN typically demonstrate reduced amplitude of motor responses with relatively preserved conduction velocities. Differential diagnoses include the demyelinating variant of GBS (AIDP) and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), where sensory nerves are additionally affected. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing albuminocytologic dissociation is also supportive but not definitive. The mainstay of acute management is immunotherapy. First-line treatments include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange, both of which have robust evidence supporting their efficacy in improving outcomes. Corticosteroids have not shown benefit and are not recommended. In pregnancy, IVIG is generally considered safe and is preferred over plasma exchange given its ease of administration and safety profile; supportive care and close monitoring remain essential in all patients, including lactating mothers. In the context provided, the marked answer (Option C) is assumed to represent the appropriate immunotherapy (e.g., IVIG or plasma exchange). This option is correct because it targets the autoimmune process underlying AMAN. Options like corticosteroids, antibiotics, symptomatic treatment only, or surgical intervention are either ineffective or inappropriate given the immune-mediated axonal injury in AMAN. 1. AMAN is a GBS variant characterized by pure motor axonal involvement and often follows an infectious trigger. 2. Early initiation of immunotherapy (IVIG or plasmapheresis) is crucial for improving outcomes. 3. Corticosteroids are not effective in the management of AMAN. Recent clinical guidelines continue to affirm the efficacy of IVIG and plasma exchange in treating AMAN, with studies demonstrating similar outcomes between these modalities.

    "explanation": "Distal symmetrical neuropathy is the most common form of neuropathy encountered in HIV-positive patients. It typically presents with bilateral, symmetric sensory disturbances\u2014such as pain, numbness, and tingling\u2014primarily in a \u201cstocking-glove\u201d distribution. This pattern reflects both the direct effects of HIV on the peripheral nervous system and the neurotoxic impact of certain antiretroviral medications. The pathogenesis involves multiple mechanisms. HIV itself may damage the dorsal root ganglia, while some antiretroviral drugs (notably older nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors like didanosine and stavudine) can induce mitochondrial toxicity, leading to axonal degeneration. This predominantly axonal injury affects small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, resulting in the classic distal sensory loss. Patients typically report gradual onset of symptoms starting in the feet, with a \u2018glove and stocking\u2019 distribution. The symptoms include burning pain, tingling, and numbness. In advanced cases, it might progress proximally. Motor involvement is less common but can occur. Given its insidious onset, it is important to differentiate this neuropathy from other forms such as diabetic or nutritional neuropathies. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supplemented by detailed patient history including HIV status, ART regimen, and symptom chronology. Electrophysiological studies (nerve conduction studies and electromyography) can confirm an axonal process. Differential diagnoses include diabetic neuropathy, vitamin B12 deficiency, toxic neuropathies from other medications, and less commonly, mononeuritis multiplex, which has an asymmetric distribution. Management focuses primarily on symptomatic relief. First-line treatments include medications such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine for neuropathic pain. In the context of pregnancy and lactation, the choice of medication is critical; non-pharmacologic measures (e.g., physical therapy) and careful use of the safest analgesics are advised. Adjustments in the antiretroviral regimen may be considered if a particular drug is implicated in neurotoxicity. Current guidelines stress individualized treatment plans that also consider potential side effects in pregnant and lactating patients. Option A (Distal symmetrical neuropathy) is correct as it is well documented as the most common neuropathy in HIV patients. Option B (Mononeuritis multiplex) is less common and typically presents with an asymmetric pattern. Option C (Pure motor neuropathy) does not correlate with the sensory symptoms predominant in HIV neuropathy, and Option D (Entrapment Neuropathy) is not typically linked with HIV infection. Recognize the 'stocking-glove' distribution of neuropathic pain in HIV patients. Always review ART medications as potential contributors to neuropathy. In pregnant or lactating patients, prioritize therapeutics that have a safer profile and consider non-pharmacologic strategies when managing neuropathic pain. Recent studies continue to support distal symmetrical polyneuropathy as the predominant neuropathic complication in HIV. Adjusted ART regimens have reduced incidence rates, but the neuropathy persists as a significant morbidity. Ongoing research emphasizes the development of effective pain management strategies and safer antiretroviral drugs, particularly considering the vulnerable populations like pregnant and lactating women.",

    "explanation": "This case involves a patient presenting with a pure sensory neuropathy where nerve conduction studies reveal demyelinating features. Anti\u2013myelin-associated glycoprotein (Anti-MAG) neuropathy is a well-recognized immune-mediated condition that typically manifests with predominantly sensory deficits, often in the context of an IgM monoclonal gammopathy. Anti-MAG neuropathy results from the production of IgM antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein, a component of Schwann cell membranes. These antibodies disrupt the integrity of the myelin sheath, leading to a demyelinating process, particularly affecting distal nerve segments. This immune-mediated damage ultimately produces the clinical picture of a slowly progressive, predominantly sensory neuropathy. Patients often present with distal sensory deficits, ataxia, and sometimes tremor, with minimal or no motor involvement. Although Anti-MAG neuropathy is more common in older individuals and has a slight male predominance, it can occur in females. The pure sensory presentation along with electrophysiological evidence of demyelination strongly supports the diagnosis. The workup includes detailed nerve conduction studies to document demyelination (e.g., slowed conduction velocities, prolonged distal latencies) and serum evaluations for anti-MAG antibodies. Additional investigations may include serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation to detect an underlying IgM monoclonal gammopathy. Differential diagnoses include other forms of CIDP (including the rare pure sensory variant), as well as sensory neuronopathies associated with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (typically related to anti-SSA/SSB antibodies) which more often follow an axonal pattern. Management strategies include immunomodulatory therapies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and rituximab have been used, though responses can be variable. In patients who are pregnant or lactating, treatment requires careful consideration: IVIG is generally viewed as safer during pregnancy, while drugs like rituximab are typically avoided due to potential harm. Individualized treatment plans based on severity and patient-specific risks are recommended. Option A (Anti-MAG) is strongly supported due to its well-established link with a demyelinating sensory neuropathy profile. Option B (Hepatitis C) is more often associated with cryoglobulinemic vasculitic neuropathies, usually exhibiting axonal changes. Option C (SSa/SSb, as seen in Sj\u00f6gren syndrome) typically causes a sensory neuronopathy that is predominantly axonal rather than demyelinating. Option D (Anti-GM1) is most commonly linked to multifocal motor neuropathy, which is primarily a motor disorder. In patients with pure sensory symptoms and demyelinating features on NCS, especially in the absence of motor deficits, it is important to consider antibody-mediated processes like Anti-MAG neuropathy. Screening for an underlying IgM monoclonal gammopathy is essential, and anti-MAG antibody testing can help distinguish this condition from other immune-mediated neuropathies. Recent clinical guidelines and research continue to support the role of anti-MAG antibody testing in patients presenting with distal acquired demyelinating sensory neuropathies. Immunotherapy, although variably effective, remains the cornerstone of treatment. Current evidence emphasizes the need for careful treatment planning in special populations such as pregnant and lactating women, with IVIG being a preferred option due to its safety profile in these groups.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Neuromuscular",
    "explanation": "Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is a genetic disorder that results from a deletion of the PMP22 gene. This gene is essential for proper myelin structure; hence, its deletion predisposes peripheral nerves to injury from minor compressions. The PMP22 gene codes for a protein that is a critical component of peripheral nerve myelin. In HNPP, a heterozygous deletion of PMP22 leads to reduced protein expression, compromising myelin integrity and making nerves more susceptible to focal demyelination in response to pressure or minor trauma. Patients with HNPP often present with recurrent, transient episodes of focal neuropathies, such as wrist drop or foot drop, after even minimal trauma or pressure on the nerves. It is an autosomal dominant disorder and may have variable clinical expression even within families. Diagnosis begins with a detailed clinical history and physical examination, followed by electrophysiological studies which reveal focal slowing of nerve conduction at sites of compression. Genetic testing confirming a PMP22 deletion is the gold standard for diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (which is due to PMP22 duplication) and other hereditary demyelinating neuropathies. Management of HNPP is primarily supportive. Patients are advised to avoid repetitive pressure or compression of nerves. Physical therapy, ergonomic adjustments, and pain management strategies are important. In cases where symptoms are severe, interventions may be considered. For pregnant and lactating patients, management remains conservative with an emphasis on reducing nerve compression and using medications that are safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, in accordance with current guidelines. Option B, which indicates a PMP22 deletion, is correct. PMP22 duplication (option C) is associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), making the differentiation critical for proper diagnosis. \u2022 HNPP should be suspected in patients presenting with recurrent nerve palsies after minor trauma or pressure.  \u2022 Genetic testing for PMP22 deletion is crucial for confirming the diagnosis.  \u2022 Differentiation between PMP22 deletion (HNPP) and duplication (CMT1A) is important in clinical practice. Recent studies validate that a PMP22 deletion is pathognomonic for HNPP and that early genetic diagnosis aids in appropriate patient management and counseling. Advanced imaging and electrophysiological techniques continue to assist in the early identification of nerve compression, while current clinical management remains focused on symptom prevention and conservative treatment strategies.",
