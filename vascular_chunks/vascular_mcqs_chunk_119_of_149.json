    "option_b": "Ipsilateral Horner",
    "option_c": "Hearing loss",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",

    "explanation": "Infarction in the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) territory typically affects the dorsal portion of the cerebellum \u2013 often the vermis and adjacent hemispheric regions \u2013 which are responsible for coordinating balance and gait. Classically, lesions in the midline (vermal) cerebellum produce ipsilateral deficits in truncal stability. The SCA supplies blood to the superior surface of the cerebellum. An infarct in this region disrupts the neural circuitry that modulates coordinated movement and balance. Although the clinical hallmark in a vermian stroke is truncal ataxia (impaired balance and unstable gait), the exam option is written as 'ipsilateral truncal hyperalgesia'. This appears to be a misnomer or typographical error because hyperalgesia (an increased pain response) is not a typical finding in cerebellar strokes. The expected finding is impaired coordination (eg, truncal ataxia) on the same side as the lesion. Patients with dorsal (vermal) cerebellar infarctions usually present with imbalance and difficulty maintaining an erect posture. They may demonstrate a wide\u2010based, staggering gait and show dysmetria (misjudging distances) on finger\u2013nose testing on the same side as the infarct. These findings directly reflect the impaired processing in the cerebellum that is important for postural control. The diagnosis hinges on high\u2010resolution imaging, most commonly MRI with diffusion\u2010weighted imaging (DWI), which will reveal an infarct in the superior cerebellar artery territory. Differential diagnoses to consider include infarcts in other cerebellar vascular territories (eg, posterior inferior cerebellar artery [PICA] infarct causing lateral medullary syndrome, which may include additional brainstem findings) and lesions that affect sensory pathways. Careful comparison of clinical findings and imaging localization is essential. Acute management follows standard ischemic stroke protocols: rapid assessment for thrombolytic eligibility (if within the therapeutic time window), control of blood pressure and blood sugar, and antiplatelet therapy once appropriate. Rehabilitation focusing on balance and coordination is key. In cases where thrombolysis is indicated in a pregnant or lactating patient, a careful risk\u2010benefit analysis is essential; current guidelines support thrombolytic therapy if benefits outweigh risks, with appropriate monitoring and counseling. Option A: Ipsilateral truncal hyperalgesia \u2013 Incorrect. Hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity) involving the trunk is characteristic of lesions affecting the spinothalamic tract in the lateral medulla, typically seen in PICA infarcts (Wallenberg syndrome). SCA territory infarcts spare these sensory pathways.  Option B: Ipsilateral Horner syndrome \u2013 Correct. The descending sympathetic fibers run through the lateral midbrain near the superior cerebellar peduncle. Infarction here disrupts these fibers, causing ipsilateral Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis). This is a hallmark sign supporting SCA territory involvement.  Option C: Hearing loss \u2013 Incorrect. Hearing loss results from infarction of the AICA territory, which supplies the internal auditory artery and cochlear nuclei. The SCA does not supply auditory pathways; thus, hearing loss is not expected in SCA infarcts.  Discriminating features: Horner syndrome localizes the lesion to the lateral brainstem, specifically implicating the SCA territory, whereas hearing loss points to AICA infarction, and truncal hyperalgesia suggests PICA involvement. - **Remember the vascular territories:** AICA infarcts cause hearing loss, PICA infarcts cause lateral medullary syndrome (including sensory deficits), and SCA infarcts cause ipsilateral ataxia plus Horner syndrome. - **Horner syndrome in stroke localizes to lateral brainstem:** Disruption of descending sympathetic fibers in the lateral midbrain or pons. - **Cerebellar signs are ipsilateral due to double crossing:** Cerebellar output crosses twice, resulting in ipsilateral deficits. - **Early MRI with DWI is essential:** It detects acute posterior circulation infarcts better than CT. - **Monitor for cerebellar edema:** Large infarcts can cause mass effect and hydrocephalus. - Use the mnemonic \"H-A-H\" for SCA infarct features: **H**orner syndrome, **A**taxia, **H**emiparesis (if corticospinal tract involved). The 2019 AHA/ASA Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke state: \"Patients with posterior circulation stroke should be managed according to the same principles as anterior circulation stroke, including timely reperfusion therapy when indicated\" (Powers et al., 2019). However, they note that clinical diagnosis can be challenging due to varied presentations. Current evidence supports MRI-DWI as the diagnostic gold standard for posterior circulation strokes, including SCA infarcts. There remain knowledge gaps in optimal management of small vessel occlusions in the SCA territory and the role of thrombectomy in distal small vessels. Emerging research on advanced imaging and neuroprotective strategies continues to evolve. Controversies include the best approach to monitoring and surgical intervention for cerebellar infarcts with edema. Recent advances emphasize multidisciplinary stroke care and individualized rehabilitation to improve functional outcomes.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is commonly associated with the development of berry (saccular) aneurysms. Patients with ADPKD are at an increased risk for intracranial aneurysms, which may rupture and cause subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This fundamental linkage is critical in understanding the neurologic risk profile in ADPKD. ADPKD involves mutations that not only lead to renal cyst formation but also affect the integrity of vascular structures, particularly the walls of cerebral arteries. This predisposition results in the formation of saccular or berry aneurysms, which are prone to rupture due to their inherent structural weakness, leading to SAH. When a patient with ADPKD presents with signs suggestive of SAH (e.g., sudden severe headache, neck stiffness, altered mental status), an intracranial aneurysm should be highly suspected. The clinical scenario ties the known association between ADPKD and berry aneurysms with the high clinical risk of SAH. Initial evaluation of suspected SAH often involves a non-contrast CT scan to identify bleeding. If SAH is detected, further evaluation with CT angiography or digital subtraction angiography is indicated to identify aneurysms. A detailed family history and screening in high-risk patients are also recommended. The management of an intracranial aneurysm in the context of SAH includes urgent neurosurgical evaluation for either endovascular coiling or surgical clipping to prevent rebleeding. For pregnant or lactating women, management must be carefully tailored: non-contrast imaging modalities or low-dose radiation techniques are preferred, and multidisciplinary consultation is vital to balance maternal and fetal risks. Guidelines emphasize the importance of prompt intervention regardless of pregnancy status if SAH is suspected. Option A (AVM) is not the typical association with ADPKD, as AVMs represent a different vascular pathology. With options C and D absent or unspecified, the complete clinical picture strongly favors option B (Intracranial aneurysm) due to its well-established association with polycystic kidney disease and SAH. In patients with ADPKD, always consider a high index of suspicion for berry aneurysms, especially when presentation is consistent with SAH. Early neuroimaging, prompt diagnosis, and timely intervention can be lifesaving. Tailor management strategies in special populations, such as pregnant or lactating patients, to minimize risks. Current research and clinical guidelines support regular screening for intracranial aneurysms in high-risk ADPKD patients. Recently updated clinical protocols advocate for early intervention when aneurysms are identified, emphasizing safety considerations in special populations such as pregnant and lactating women.",

    "question": "Patient with acute stroke in the left occipital lobe what will you see in his visual fields:",

    "option_b": "Incongruent homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing",
    "option_c": "Non-Macular sparing with congruent homonymous hemianopia",
    "option_d": "Non-Macular sparing with incongruent homonymous hemianopia",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "The visual pathways extend from the retina, through the optic nerves, chiasm, and tracts to the lateral geniculate nucleus, then via the optic radiations to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Lesions in the occipital cortex, particularly those affecting the primary visual area, typically produce a homonymous hemianopia that is highly congruous (i.e., similar defects in both eyes). Due to dual blood supply to the macular region (from both the posterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery), macular sparing is frequently seen in occipital lobe strokes. An infarct in the left occipital lobe (often due to occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery) leads to ischemia of the visual cortex. The central (macular) region often remains partially perfused by collateral vessels, resulting in preserved central vision despite a loss of peripheral vision in the corresponding contralateral visual field. Patients with a left occipital lobe stroke typically present with a right homonymous hemianopia. The degree of congruity (i.e., how similar the visual field defects are between the two eyes) is high because the lesion is confined to the primary visual cortex, and the macular sparing occurs due to collateral vascular supply. This presentation helps differentiate occipital lobe lesions from those affecting the optic radiations, which may produce less congruent deficits. Evaluation begins with a meticulous visual field examination (such as confrontation testing followed by automated perimetry, e.g., Humphrey Visual Field testing) to characterize the type and extent of visual loss. Neuroimaging, particularly brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging, is crucial to localize the infarct in the occipital lobe. Differential diagnoses include lesions affecting the optic radiations (which might show less congruity) or optic nerve pathology (which would present with unilateral findings). The management of an acute occipital stroke involves emergent evaluation for reperfusion therapies, such as intravenous thrombolytics (tPA) if within the appropriate time window and if there are no contraindications. Mechanical thrombectomy may be considered based on the vessel involved and extent of infarction. In pregnancy, recent guidelines support the cautious use of tPA when benefits outweigh the risks, with appropriate maternal and fetal monitoring. During lactation, tPA is considered safe due to minimal secretion into breast milk, but each case should be evaluated individually. Secondary stroke prevention (risk factor modification, antiplatelet therapy, and control of comorbid conditions) is also essential. Option A (Congruent homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing) is the classic description seen in occipital lobe strokes. Option B (Incongruent homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing) is more consistent with lesions involving the optic radiations rather than the occipital cortex. Options C and D are incorrect as they state non-macular sparing, which does not align with the typical clinical presentation caused by the collateral vascular supply to the macula in occipital infarcts. A stroke affecting the occipital lobe typically presents with a homonymous hemianopia that is congruous and spares the macula due to dual blood supply. Recognizing this pattern can help localize the lesion and prompt timely neuroimaging and initiation of reperfusion therapy, which is critical in acute stroke management. Special considerations should be given when managing stroke in pregnant or lactating patients. Recent studies and clinical guidelines emphasize early neuroimaging (using MRI/CT) in suspected stroke cases to identify occipital cortex involvement. Updated protocols for reperfusion therapies, including the use of tPA and mechanical thrombectomy, underscore the importance of timely intervention. Current literature supports that the pattern of a congruent homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing is a reliable clinical indicator of a cortical visual field defect, particularly involving the occipital lobe.",

    "question": "case of subacute stroke CT brain attached, TTE: normal, 48 hours Holter normal what to do next:",

    "option_c": "Coagulation workup",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In ischemic stroke workup, the identification of the embolic source is critical. When the initial cardiac evaluations (transthoracic echocardiogram [TTE] and a 48\u2010hour Holter monitor) are normal, clinicians must look for other common sources of emboli. Carotid atherosclerotic disease is one such common cause, especially for strokes involving anterior circulation. Carotid atherosclerosis involves the buildup of plaque within the carotid arteries. These plaques can narrow the vessel lumen or rupture, causing emboli to dislodge and travel to the brain, resulting in an ischemic event. Even if cardiac sources have been ruled out, significant carotid stenosis may be the culprit. Patients with traditional vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking) are more susceptible to carotid artery disease. In a subacute stroke scenario where cardiac workup is negative, evaluating the carotid arteries helps determine if atherosclerotic disease is the cause. After a normal TTE and 48\u2010hour Holter monitoring, it is standard to proceed with imaging of the cervical vessels. Carotid ultrasound is a noninvasive, widely available, cost-effective method to assess for significant stenosis or plaque vulnerability that could be responsible for embolic strokes. Once carotid stenosis is identified, management may include medical therapy (such as antiplatelet agents, statins, and risk factor control) and, in cases of hemodynamically significant stenosis, revascularization procedures like carotid endarterectomy or stenting may be indicated. Importantly, in pregnant or lactating patients, carotid ultrasound is safe (as it involves no ionizing radiation), and any ensuing medical management (such as antiplatelets) should follow current safety guidelines relevant to pregnancy and lactation. Option A, prolonged cardiac monitoring, is sometimes used to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but is generally considered when there is a high index of suspicion or when the initial workup is inconclusive for a cardioembolic source. Option C, a coagulation workup, is more appropriate in younger patients or those without traditional risk factors where a hypercoagulable state is suspected. With the normal cardiac studies and a subacute presentation more suggestive of a large-artery source, Option B (Carotid US) is the appropriate next step. Option D is not provided. Carotid ultrasound remains one of the first-line noninvasive approaches in the evaluation of stroke etiology when suspecting extracranial large-artery disease. Even when initial monitors for atrial fibrillation are negative, consider further evaluation with both prolonged cardiac monitoring (if clinical suspicion continues) and vascular imaging based on the patient\u2019s presentation. Current AHA/ASA guidelines for stroke evaluation emphasize the importance of vascular imaging in acute ischemic stroke. There is strong evidence supporting the use of carotid ultrasound in detecting significant stenosis, which can guide further interventions and tailored secondary prevention strategies. In patients with negative cardiac evaluations, early carotid imaging is crucial in adapting the therapeutic approach.",

    "option_d": "Posterior cerebral artery",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "A posterior communicating artery aneurysm is classically associated with an isolated third nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy. In this scenario, the patient\u2019s severe headache and unilateral dilated, non-reactive pupil (6 mm vs 3 mm) strongly suggest compressive involvement of the oculomotor nerve \u2013 a hallmark of a PCom aneurysm. The aneurysm arising from the posterior communicating artery can enlarge and compress the oculomotor nerve, particularly its superficial parasympathetic fibers responsible for pupillary constriction. Compression leads to pupillary dilation (mydriasis) and impaired reactivity. The severe headache may be due to local irritation from aneurysmal expansion or a sentinel bleed, even in the absence of full subarachnoid hemorrhage. Clinically, a patient with a third nerve palsy from a PCom aneurysm typically presents with a dilated pupil that is non-reactive to light, ptosis, and a \u2018down and out\u2019 deviation of the eye. The headache accentuates the concern for an aneurysmal process, making this finding highly suggestive in the right clinical context. Initial workup includes neuroimaging \u2013 a noncontrast CT scan to rule out hemorrhage followed by CT angiography or MR angiography to evaluate for aneurysms. Differential diagnoses include aneurysms in other cerebral vessels and microvascular ischemic cranial nerve palsies; however, pupil involvement favors compressive etiologies over ischemic ones. Management involves urgent neurosurgical consultation. The treatment options include endovascular coiling or surgical clipping, depending on the aneurysm\u2019s size, morphology, and patient factors. Blood pressure control and avoidance of stressors are essential. In pregnant or lactating patients, imaging modalities without ionizing radiation (MR angiography) and careful multidisciplinary management are favored. Option A (Anterior communicating) is more commonly involved in cognitive and personality changes rather than isolated third nerve involvement. Option C (Anterior cerebral artery) typically presents with lower limb motor/sensory deficits. Option D (Posterior cerebral artery) usually presents with visual field deficits. Option B (Posterior communicating) correctly correlates with the anatomical location affecting the oculomotor nerve. 1. A dilated, non-reactive pupil in the setting of headache is a red flag for an aneurysmal compression of the oculomotor nerve. 2. PCom aneurysms are the most common cause of compressive third nerve palsies with pupillary involvement. Recent guidelines emphasize early identification of aneurysms with advanced imaging techniques (CTA/MRA) and prompt neurosurgical intervention to reduce the risk of rupture. Emerging data support individualized management based on aneurysm characteristics and patient comorbidities.",

    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness) accompanied by transient dysarthria is highly suggestive of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to embolic phenomena from a carotid origin. Carotid artery evaluation is central to the workup of such presentations. Often, atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery can embolize, temporarily occluding blood flow to the retina (resulting in amaurosis fugax) and parts of the brain responsible for speech. The transient nature of these symptoms is characteristic of TIA, indicating reversible ischemia. Patients with these transient neurologic symptoms should be assessed for carotid artery disease. The unilateral nature of amaurosis fugax often localizes the pathology to the ipsilateral carotid artery, while associated cerebral symptoms (like dysarthria) reflect embolic dissemination. The initial diagnostic approach should include a noninvasive carotid duplex ultrasound (Carotid Doppler) to assess for the degree of carotid stenosis or plaque burden. Differential diagnoses include retinal migraine, ocular conditions, and cardiac embolic sources\u2014hence additional workup with echocardiography and Holter monitoring is often performed. After confirming carotid disease, management includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, and risk factor modification. In high-grade stenosis, carotid endarterectomy or stenting may be considered. In pregnancy, non-ionizing imaging methods (such as carotid duplex ultrasound) are preferred. Lactating mothers can also safely undergo ultrasound evaluation. Option A (US carotid Doppler) is the correct initial investigation for suspected carotid artery stenosis in TIA patients. Other tests (CT/MR angiography) may be used later for further delineation, but ultrasound is noninvasive, cost-effective, and free of radiation. 1. Amaurosis fugax is often a harbinger of carotid artery disease and future cerebrovascular events. 2. Early detection with a carotid Doppler can guide timely interventions to reduce stroke risk. Current American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines recommend prompt carotid imaging in patients with TIA symptoms to identify those who may benefit from revascularization procedures alongside aggressive medical management.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Post-thrombolytic management in acute stroke involves careful blood pressure regulation. Elevated blood pressure following tPA administration increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. High blood pressure after tPA can lead to reperfusion injury and an increased risk of intracranial bleeding. The stress response and anxiety may further exacerbate hypertension. Tightly controlled BP management mitigates these risks. In this case, after administration of tPA, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 190/90 mm Hg, which exceeds the recommended threshold (generally <180/105 mm Hg post-tPA). The patient\u2019s anxiety could be a secondary response, and it further underscores the need for prompt BP control. Continuous monitoring of neurological status and blood pressure is essential following tPA. Differential considerations for elevated BP include uncontrolled baseline hypertension, pain, or stress responses. However, in the post-thrombolytic setting, rapid BP management is critical. The first-line management for blood pressure management in the post-tPA period is intravenous antihypertensive therapy. Nicardipine is preferred due to its ease of titration and rapid onset of action. It is administered as an IV infusion to achieve a controlled reduction in blood pressure. For pregnant or lactating patients, nicardipine, though generally categorized as C, has been used with caution under close monitoring if necessary. Option A (Amlodipine) is unsuitable as it is an oral agent with a slow onset and less titratability. Option C (Observation) is inappropriate given the risk of hemorrhage with elevated BP. Option D (Diazepam) may reduce anxiety but does not adequately address the urgent need for BP reduction. Option B (Nicardipine) is the correct choice, consistent with current guidelines. 1. Post-tPA blood pressure must be maintained below 180/105 mm Hg to minimize hemorrhagic complications. 2. IV nicardipine is a titratable and preferred agent in this setting. The latest stroke management guidelines reaffirm the importance of immediate blood pressure control post-thrombolysis, with nicardipine being the agent of choice due to its rapid and easily adjustable effects.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "In patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) symptoms, a thorough evaluation of potential sources is paramount. With a negative cardiac workup (echo and Holter) in a patient with a brief TIA, investigation of the cervical vasculature is warranted as carotid artery atherosclerosis remains a common cause. Atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries can lead to embolization and transient occlusion of cerebral vessels, resulting in TIA symptoms. A TIA lasting around 10 minutes is characteristic of embolic events from a carotid lesion rather than a cardioembolic source if the cardiac evaluation is negative. The negative echocardiogram and Holter monitoring suggest that the source of embolism is less likely to be cardiac. Therefore, evaluation of the neck vessels, particularly the carotids, is critical. This helps in diagnosing significant stenosis or plaque that may necessitate intervention to prevent stroke. The diagnostic workup for TIA includes brain imaging and vascular imaging. While a carotid duplex ultrasound is often used as an initial noninvasive test, a Neck CTA provides a more detailed visualization of the carotid anatomy, making it a valuable next step if further clarification is needed. Differential diagnoses include vasculitis, dissection, and small vessel disease but these are less common when cardiac sources have been ruled out. After identifying a carotid lesion, management involves medical therapy (antiplatelets, statins, and risk factor modification) and potential surgical intervention (carotid endarterectomy or stenting) for significant stenosis. In pregnant or lactating patients, a carotid duplex ultrasound is preferred due to the absence of ionizing radiation; however, if CTA is necessary, the risks and benefits must be weighed carefully. Option A (Neck CTA) is an appropriate next step for detailed vascular imaging to evaluate the carotid arteries when cardiac sources have been excluded. Option B (Brain MRI) would be more useful for assessing parenchymal injury but does not directly identify the source of emboli. Given the clinical context, Option A is the more logical choice. 1. When cardiac evaluations are negative in TIA workup, the carotid arteries should be scrutinized for atherosclerotic disease. 2. Neck CTA offers high-resolution imaging and is particularly useful in assessing the extent of carotid pathology. Recent guideline updates from stroke societies recommend a comprehensive vascular workup in TIA patients, highlighting the utility of advanced imaging (including CTA) to identify extracranial carotid stenosis and guide further intervention.",

    "explanation": "This case involves an acute ischemic stroke within the thrombolysis time window. The core concept is rapid identification and treatment of ischemic strokes with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to salvage the ischemic penumbra, as long as hemorrhage is excluded on non\u2010contrast CT. Acute ischemic stroke is most often caused by thromboembolic occlusion of an artery supplying the brain. In this patient, risk factors (diabetes, hypertension) predispose to atherosclerosis. Although she showed some improvement (which may reflect partial spontaneous recanalization or penumbral recovery), the underlying clot still jeopardizes brain tissue. Early intervention with tPA can lyse the clot, restoring blood flow and improving outcomes. The patient initially presented with dense right hemiparesis and aphasia\u2014classic signs of a left hemispheric stroke affecting both motor pathways and language centers. Slight improvement en route does not necessarily mean that she has fully recovered; persistent neurological deficits that are disabling warrant treatment with IV tPA. The initial diagnostic step is obtaining a non-contrast head CT to rule out hemorrhage. Differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic stroke, stroke mimics (seizure, migraine), and transient ischemic attacks. In some cases, further vascular imaging (CT angiogram) may be considered to identify large vessel occlusions, but here the absence of hemorrhage is the key criterion for proceeding with IV tPA. According to the latest AHA/ASA guidelines, IV tPA is the first-line treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke who present within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and meet inclusion criteria. Even with modest improvement, if the deficits remain functionally disabling (e.g., severe hemiparesis and aphasia), tPA is indicated. Pregnancy and lactation considerations are not applicable in this 70\u2010year-old patient. Option A (IV tPA) is correct because the patient is within the time window and still has disabling symptoms despite slight improvement. Option B (CT angiogram) might be considered for evaluating large vessel occlusion when planning for endovascular therapy, but it is not the immediate next step after confirming the absence of hemorrhage when IV tPA is indicated. Options C and D are not provided and thus not relevant. 1. Time is brain\u2014prompt evaluation and treatment of acute ischemic stroke improves outcomes. 2. Even if there is slight improvement en route, residual disabling deficits warrant thrombolytic therapy. 3. A non\u2010contrast CT scan is essential to rule out hemorrhage before administering IV tPA. Recent studies and updated guidelines continue to support the use of IV tPA in eligible patients within the recommended time window, even in cases where there is some clinical improvement, provided that disabling deficits remain. Advanced imaging is increasingly used to assess penumbral tissue but does not delay the initiation of tPA when criteria are met.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question addresses the evaluation of postpartum headache, emphasizing the importance of considering cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in postpartum women. Postpartum women are in a hypercoagulable state, which increases the risk of thrombus formation in the cerebral venous sinuses. CVST leads to impaired venous drainage, increased intracranial pressure, and potentially venous cerebral infarction. The absence of fever and normal vital signs help rule out infectious etiologies. A severe headache in a postpartum woman, particularly in the first few weeks after delivery, raises suspicion for CVST. Normal blood pressure, electrolytes, and renal function help differentiate it from conditions like postpartum preeclampsia. Despite an uneventful vaginal delivery, the hypercoagulable state of the postpartum period is a recognized risk factor. The gold standard imaging for suspected CVST is a CT venogram (or MR venography), which can visualize venous occlusions in the brain. Differential diagnoses include postpartum preeclampsia (which would show elevated blood pressure or abnormal labs), post-dural puncture headache (typically positional), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (usually with a different clinical profile). The first-line management for CVST is anticoagulation, typically with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), even in the postpartum period. This treatment is maintained for several months with a transition to oral anticoagulants if indicated. Pregnancy and lactation considerations: LMWH is considered safe during lactation. Further evaluation for underlying thrombophilic disorders may be warranted. Option B (CT venogram) is correct because it is the appropriate imaging study to confirm a diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in a postpartum patient with a severe headache. Option A (Angiogram) is less commonly used and more invasive. Option C (Urine protein and liver function tests) is indicated for preeclampsia, which is unlikely given the normal vital signs and labs. Option D (Lumbar puncture) is not indicated in this clinical context due to the absence of signs of meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage. 1. The postpartum period is a high-risk period for CVST due to hypercoagulability. 2. CT venogram is the imaging modality of choice when CVST is suspected. 3. Normal vital signs and laboratory values help distinguish CVST from postpartum preeclampsia. Current guidelines and recent research underscore the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of CVST in postpartum women. Anticoagulation with LMWH remains the first-line treatment, and imaging with CT venogram (or MRV) is recommended for accurate diagnosis.",

    "explanation": "This question focuses on identifying the most common arterial territory involved in lacunar strokes, which are a type of small vessel disease commonly seen in patients with vascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. Lacunar strokes result from lipohyalinosis and microatheroma formation in the small penetrating arteries, particularly the lenticulostriate arteries, which supply the deep structures of the brain (e.g., basal ganglia and internal capsule). These occlusions lead to small, deep infarcts. In a 50\u2010year\u2010old male with diabetes, hypertension, and a smoking history, lacunar strokes are common. Symptoms typically involve pure motor or sensory deficits, depending on the location of the infarct. The lenticulostriate arteries are most commonly implicated in such cases. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by neuroimaging. CT or MRI may show small, deep infarcts in the territory of the lenticulostriate arteries. Differential diagnoses include embolic strokes from larger vessels (e.g., due to ICA stenosis) or cardioembolic sources, which usually affect cortical regions. Management focuses on secondary prevention: aggressive control of hypertension, diabetes, and cessation of smoking, along with antiplatelet therapy. There is no role for thrombolysis beyond the acute period if the patient presents late. Pregnancy and lactation considerations are not typically relevant in this demographic. Option D (Lenticulostriate arteries) is correct because these small penetrating vessels are the most frequently affected in lacunar strokes. Option A (ICA stenosis) and Option B (Aortic atheroma) are more commonly associated with embolic or large vessel strokes, while Option C (Hypercoagulable state) is not the typical cause in a patient with conventional vascular risk factors. 1. Lacunar strokes are the result of small vessel disease and typically occur in patients with hypertension and diabetes. 2. The lenticulostriate arteries are the classic site of involvement. 3. Management is centered on risk factor modification and secondary prevention. Recent research reaffirms the crucial role of intensive risk factor management in reducing the recurrence of lacunar strokes. Current guidelines continue to advocate for stringent blood pressure, glycemic, and lipid management in these patients.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This question tests the understanding of neurologic exam findings in stroke patients, especially the implications of gaze preference and associated cranial nerve deficits. In a cortical stroke involving the frontal eye field, there is a loss of the voluntary contralateral gaze. The patient\u2019s eyes deviate towards the side of the lesion (due to unopposed action of the intact contralateral eye field). In a left hemisphere stroke, this results in a left gaze preference, accompanied by right-sided motor deficits, including a contralateral upper motor neuron facial palsy. A patient with an acute stroke and left gaze preference is likely to have a left hemispheric lesion. Consequently, the motor pathways, including fibers controlling the lower face, are affected, leading to a right upper motor neuron (UMN) facial palsy. UMN lesions typically spare the forehead due to bilateral cortical innervation. The diagnosis is based on focal neurological deficits on examination and confirmed by neuroimaging (CT or MRI) to localize the lesion. Differential diagnoses might include brainstem strokes (which may involve cranial nerve findings) and other causes of gaze palsies. However, the presence of an UMN facial palsy and gaze preference points to a cortical process. Management is tailored to the underlying stroke etiology. Acute ischemic strokes are managed with reperfusion therapy (IV tPA within the therapeutic window) and supportive care. In this exam finding, the focus is on clinical localization rather than immediate management changes. Pregnancy and lactation considerations are not typically relevant in this scenario. Option A (Right upper motor neuron facial palsy) is correct because a left hemispheric lesion causes contralateral facial weakness in an UMN pattern. Option B (Right lower motor neuron facial palsy) is incorrect since LMN lesions would have a different distribution and etiology. Option C (Left upper motor neuron facial palsy) would be ipsilateral to the gaze preference and does not fit with the contralateral deficit expected. Option D (Oculomotor nerve involvement) would present with additional findings (such as ptosis and pupillary abnormalities) that are not described in this case. 1. In cortical strokes, gaze preference is typically toward the side of the lesion. 2. An upper motor neuron facial palsy will present contralaterally to a hemispheric lesion. 3. The frontal eye field plays a critical role in directing voluntary gaze, and its impairment leads to characteristic exam findings. Recent studies have reinforced the value of a detailed neurologic exam in localizing stroke lesions. Current guidelines emphasize a rapid clinical assessment to guide urgent imaging and treatment decisions in acute stroke management.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "This case involves the evaluation of an intracranial hemorrhage in a middle\u2010aged woman. When a patient is found unconscious and a CT scan reveals blood, distinguishing between different hemorrhage etiologies (such as aneurysmal rupture, hypertensive bleed, amyloid angiopathy, or traumatic injury) is essential. Aneurysmal hemorrhage is the classic cause of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, particularly seen in middle\u2010aged adults. Aneurysmal hemorrhage typically occurs when a saccular (\u2018berry\u2019) aneurysm, often located in the circle of Willis, ruptures. The rupture leads to bleeding into the subarachnoid space, causing a sudden increase in intracranial pressure. This can result in loss of consciousness, severe headache (often described as a 'thunderclap headache'), and, if extensive, may also lead to intraparenchymal extension. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage often present with sudden onset of a severe headache, altered mental status or loss of consciousness, and sometimes focal neurological deficits. In this 42-year-old patient, the presentation of being found unconscious along with CT findings consistent with blood in the subarachnoid space (as suggested by the question context) points toward an aneurysmal origin. The initial investigation for suspected intracranial hemorrhage is a non-contrast CT scan, which can reliably detect acute blood. If a subarachnoid hemorrhage is identified, the next steps include CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to locate and characterize the aneurysm. Differential diagnoses include hypertensive hemorrhage (typically causing deep or basal ganglia bleeds), amyloid angiopathy (more common in elderly patients with lobar bleeds), and trauma (which would often show extra-axial bleeds such as epidural or subdural hematomas). Once an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is diagnosed, urgent management is critical. The main goals include securing the aneurysm through neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling to prevent rebleeding, and the prevention of vasospasm, commonly managed with nimodipine. In acute settings, supportive care to manage intracranial pressure, blood pressure, and electrolyte imbalances is essential. In pregnant or lactating patients, additional care must be taken: imaging studies should minimize fetal radiation exposure (using MRI or shielding techniques when possible), and treatment modalities should be selected to limit risks to the fetus, with multidisciplinary consultation (neurology, neurosurgery, obstetrics) being imperative. Option A (Amyloid angiopathy) is more typical in elderly patients and causes lobar hemorrhages. Option C (Hypertensive hemorrhage) usually presents with bleeding in deep brain structures in individuals with longstanding hypertension \u2013 less likely in a 42-year-old female without that history. Option D (Traumatic hemorrhage) would usually be associated with a history of head injury and produce extra-axial hemorrhage patterns (epidural or subdural). Option B (Aneurysmal hemorrhage) aligns best with the patient demographics, clinical presentation, and presumed CT findings showing subarachnoid blood. Immediate recognition of a subarachnoid hemorrhage is vital, as time-sensitive interventions (securing the aneurysm and preventing vasospasm) are necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality. In any patient presenting with a sudden severe headache or with loss of consciousness and corresponding CT findings, an aneurysmal rupture should be high on the differential. Special considerations must be taken in pregnant or lactating women to balance diagnostic and therapeutic risks. Current guidelines, such as those from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, emphasize early aneurysm repair (via endovascular or surgical methods) to prevent rebleeding and the use of nimodipine to reduce the incidence of vasospasm. There is ongoing research into optimal management strategies, but early diagnosis and intervention remain the cornerstone of improving outcomes. In pregnant patients, recent recommendations stress minimizing fetal exposure to ionizing radiation and tailoring neurosurgical interventions to ensure maternal and fetal safety.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by fluent, yet often nonsensical or jargon-filled speech with impaired comprehension. The core concept involves a lesion in the posterior language area, typically in the dominant (usually left) hemisphere within the perisylvian region. The syndrome is most commonly due to an infarct or lesion affecting the posterior superior temporal gyrus and adjacent areas. This region, in the posterior perisylvian cortex, is responsible for processing and understanding spoken language. Disruption here leads to fluent speech that lacks meaningful content and poor auditory comprehension. Patients with Wernicke's aphasia produce well-articulated but meaningless speech, have impaired comprehension, and often show difficulty in naming objects or understanding complex language. Recognition of these features, along with neuroimaging that shows damage in the left temporoparietal region, aids in diagnosis. Diagnosis is clinical \u2013 through detailed language and neuropsychological assessments \u2013 and is supported by imaging modalities like MRI or CT to localize the lesion. Differential diagnoses include Broca\u2019s aphasia (characterized by nonfluent speech with relatively preserved comprehension) and conduction aphasia (where repetition is particularly impaired). Management involves treating the underlying cause (for example, stroke, tumor, or trauma) and instituting early rehabilitation with speech therapy to maximize recovery. For pregnant or lactating patients, neuroimaging (preferably MRI without contrast when possible) and speech therapy remain the cornerstone, with considerations to minimize any fetal exposure to potentially harmful agents. Option A (Posteroinferior perisylvian) misleads by suggesting a designation that is not typically used to define Wernicke\u2019s area. Option B (Posterior perisylvian) correctly captures the location of the lesion, while Option C (Frontoparietal Operculum) more closely corresponds to Broca\u2019s area, which is involved in language production rather than comprehension. \u2022 Wernicke\u2019s aphasia is recognized by fluent but meaningless speech and poor language comprehension.  \u2022 The lesion is classically in the posterior superior temporal gyrus near the Sylvian fissure in the left hemisphere. Recent neuroimaging studies have helped refine our understanding of language networks. Current stroke and aphasia rehabilitation guidelines emphasize early, targeted speech therapy to harness neuroplasticity, even in pregnant or lactating patients where benefits outweigh minimal risks from imaging protocols.",

    "explanation": "Prevention strategies in medicine are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Tertiary prevention involves measures to reduce the impact of an ongoing illness or injury that has lasting effects\u2014in this case, rehabilitation after a stroke. Following an ischemic stroke, brain tissue injury leads to deficits in motor, language, and cognitive functions. Rehabilitation through physiotherapy and speech therapy aims to maximize neuroplasticity and functional recovery, thus reducing disability. Patients recovering from stroke often face challenges such as motor weakness, language dysfunction, and impaired activities of daily living. Therapies like physiotherapy and speech therapy help improve these deficits and lessen long\u2010term disability, representing tertiary prevention. The evaluation involves clinical scales (e.g., the NIH Stroke Scale) and functional assessments that guide early rehabilitation strategies. Differential considerations include secondary prevention measures such as antiplatelet therapy and risk factor modification, which are distinct from rehabilitative interventions. Current guidelines (like those by the AHA/ASA) strongly recommend timely initiation of rehabilitation therapies post-stroke to improve outcomes. For pregnant or lactating patients, physiotherapy and speech therapy are safe interventions and are adapted as needed based on the patient\u2019s overall clinical status. Option A (Primary prevention) is incorrect because these measures are meant to prevent the onset of disease, not manage its sequelae; Option B (Secondary prevention) targets early disease detection and immediate management; Option C (Tertiary prevention) is correct as it pertains to rehabilitation after the disease has occurred. \u2022 Rehabilitation (through physiotherapy and speech therapy) is a classic example of tertiary prevention.  \u2022 Early, multidisciplinary intervention improves functional outcomes in stroke patients. Recent guidelines underscore early, intensive rehabilitation to enhance long-term functional recovery.

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "Secondary prevention of stroke focuses on preventing recurrence after an initial event. When a patient experiences a stroke while already on aspirin, it raises the possibility of aspirin resistance or treatment failure, necessitating a re-evaluation of the antiplatelet regimen. Aspirin works by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and reducing thromboxane A2 production, which decreases platelet aggregation. However, in some individuals, this mechanism may not provide adequate protection (so\u2010called aspirin failure), and alternate pathways of platelet aggregation may persist. Clopidogrel, which inhibits the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, offers a different mechanism of action and can be effective in patients who experience ischemic events despite aspirin therapy. This patient, who sustained a right pontine stroke with an NIHSS of 8 while on aspirin, demonstrates a scenario where the current antiplatelet regimen may be insufficient. A review of his medication adherence, dosing, and potential resistance is warranted. Switching to clopidogrel as monotherapy is supported by evidence in patients with non-cardioembolic stroke who have had an event on aspirin. Before altering therapy, it is important to review patient compliance, assess for other stroke risk factors, and consider imaging and laboratory tests if necessary. Differential considerations include the need for dual antiplatelet therapy or even evaluation for cardioembolic sources if suspected, though the clinical scenario here suggests a non-cardioembolic mechanism. According to current guidelines, if a patient experiences a stroke while on aspirin, switching to an alternative antiplatelet agent like clopidogrel is a reasonable approach. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) is typically reserved for a short duration in minor strokes (often defined by a lower NIHSS score) due to increased bleeding risk when used long term. In patients with moderate stroke severity (as in this case), monotherapy with clopidogrel is preferred. When considering pregnant or lactating patients, the use of antiplatelet agents is a careful balance; aspirin is generally preferred in pregnancy, but when there is clear aspirin failure, clopidogrel may be used if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, following a thorough risk\u2013benefit analysis in consultation with obstetrics. Option A (Add clopidogrel to aspirin) suggests dual therapy, which is typically indicated only for a short period in minor stroke/TIA and is not generally recommended long term in moderate strokes due to bleeding risk. Option B (Keep on aspirin) does not address the apparent treatment failure. Option C (Change aspirin to clopidogrel) is correct as it addresses the therapeutic failure by switching mechanisms of action. Option D (Start anticoagulation) is inappropriate here because there is no evidence of a cardioembolic source. \u2022 Stroke recurrence on aspirin may suggest aspirin resistance, warranting a switch to an alternative agent.  \u2022 Long-term dual antiplatelet therapy is generally avoided due to increased bleeding risk unless specifically indicated for a short term. Recent studies and guidelines, including updates from the AHA/ASA and findings from trials such as CAPRIE, support the use of clopidogrel in patients who experience an ischemic event on aspirin. This evidence reinforces a switch of antiplatelet strategy rather than the prolonged use of dual therapy, especially in strokes with moderate severity.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Vascular Neurology/Stroke",
    "explanation": "AICA syndrome, or lateral pontine syndrome caused by occlusion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, is defined by deficits that involve both cerebellar and inner ear structures. The concept here is the direct relationship between the vascular territory and the clinical features observed. The anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) supplies blood to portions of the lateral pons, the cerebellum, and the inner ear. Occlusion of AICA leads to ischemia in these areas, resulting in signs such as facial weakness, hearing loss, vertigo, and ataxia. Clinically, AICA infarction may present with a constellation of symptoms including peripheral facial paralysis, vestibulocochlear deficits (such as hearing loss and vertigo), and ataxia. These findings help differentiate it from other brainstem syndromes, such as those involving the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds supported by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that confirms infarction in the AICA territory. The differential includes lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome from PICA occlusion and other brainstem infarcts, each with its own distinct set of neurological deficits. Acute management includes standard stroke care protocols, often involving antiplatelet therapy and risk factor modification. Rehabilitation for balance and facial function might be necessary. In pregnant or lactating patients, management follows the same principles with careful assessment of risks versus benefits for any pharmacological intervention and ensuring safety with neuroimaging. Option A (AICA) is the only provided option and correctly identifies the artery involved in this syndrome. The absence of other options reinforces that the question is testing recognition of the vascular supply related to the clinical syndrome. \u2022 AICA infarcts typically present with audiovestibular symptoms in addition to signs of lateral pontine involvement.  \u2022 Differentiation from PICA (Wallenberg syndrome) is key, as the latter does not typically produce hearing deficits. Recent advances in neuroimaging have improved the localization of brainstem strokes. Current stroke guidelines continue to support tailored antiplatelet and rehabilitative strategies based on specific vascular territories, with appropriate adjustments for vulnerable populations including pregnant and lactating women.",
