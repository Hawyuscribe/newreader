    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is managed primarily with levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet). Over time, patients may experience 'wearing\u2010off' phenomena as the medication\u2019s effect diminishes before the next dose. Adjusting therapy to extend the clinical benefit between doses is key. Wearing\u2010off occurs due to fluctuations in dopaminergic stimulation as levodopa plasma levels fall, resulting in a reemergence of motor symptoms. COMT inhibitors (eg, entacapone) work by blocking the metabolism of levodopa, thereby prolonging its effective plasma concentration and clinical benefit. Patients with PD on Sinemet may notice motor symptoms reappearing in the 30 minutes before their next dose \u2013 a classic presentation of wearing-off. Recognizing this pattern is essential as it guides the addition of adjunctive therapies rather than merely increasing levodopa, which might worsen dyskinesia. The differential diagnosis for end-of-dose motor fluctuations includes motor response fluctuations (wearing-off), dyskinesia, and instances of nonmotor fluctuations. A careful review of the timing of symptoms in relation to medication dosing is critical. First-line management for wearing-off includes the addition of COMT inhibitors to prolong levodopa\u2019s action. Alternative strategies may include the use of MAO-B inhibitors or adjusting the levodopa dosing schedule. In pregnant or lactating women, careful consideration should be given to the safety profiles of these agents, with shared decision-making and consultation with specialists as warranted. Option A (add COMT inhibitors) is correct because it directly addresses the wearing-off phenomenon by extending the half-life of levodopa. Option B (Increase Sinemet dose) might temporarily relieve symptoms but can worsen dyskinesia and fluctuations. Option C (Seliginline \u2013 likely intended to refer to selegiline) is less effective in this context and is not the ideal choice for wearing-off. 1. Wearing-off in PD is best managed by prolonging the effect of levodopa rather than simply increasing the dose. 2. COMT inhibitors are an effective and well\u2010established adjunct in managing motor fluctuations. 3. Symptom timing relative to medication dosing is a vital diagnostic clue. Recent guidelines and studies support the use of COMT inhibitors as a first-line adjunct to Sinemet in patients experiencing wearing-off. Ongoing PD management research emphasizes individualized therapy with careful monitoring of motor and nonmotor symptoms, particularly in special populations such as pregnant or breastfeeding women.",

    "question": "DM patient with tremor at rest, during action, kinetics",
    "option_a": "Neuropathy Tremor",
    "option_b": "Rubral Tremor",
    "option_c": "Essential Tremor",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Tremors are classified based on when they occur (at rest, postural, kinetic). A tremor that appears at rest, during action, and with kinetic movements suggests a complex tremor, such as a rubral (Holmes) tremor, rather than a purely action tremor like essential tremor. Rubral tremor (Holmes tremor) arises from lesions that disrupt the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits, particularly involving the red nucleus region. This leads to a low-frequency, large-amplitude tremor manifested in multiple context \u2013 at rest, when maintaining posture, and during voluntary movement. The tremor in rubral tremor is typically unilateral (though it can be bilateral in some cases) and is noted to be present across various states. Diabetic patients are not specifically prone to essential tremor or neuropathic tremor that fits this description, making rubral tremor the more fitting diagnosis when tremor is seen at rest and with action. Differentiating tremor types involves carefully documenting the context in which tremors appear. Differential diagnoses include essential tremor (predominantly postural and kinetic), Parkinsonian rest tremor (typically absent during action), and neuropathic tremor (a less clearly defined entity). Neuroimaging may be warranted to evaluate for lesions causing rubral tremor. Management of rubral tremor is challenging. First-line treatments include medications such as levetiracetam, clonazepam, or sometimes anticholinergic agents, though responses are variable. In refractory cases, surgical options like deep brain stimulation may be considered. In pregnancy or lactation, medication adjustments are necessary to balance maternal benefits and fetal risks, and nonpharmacologic measures may be prioritized. Option A (Neuropathy Tremor) is not a well-recognized, defined entity in neurology. Option B (Rubral Tremor) is the best match since the tremor described occurs at rest, during action, and with intention. Option C (Essential Tremor) is typically an action (postural/kinetic) tremor and does not characteristically occur at rest. 1. Rubral (Holmes) tremor is unique in that it is present at rest, posturally, and during movement. 2. Essential tremor is characteristically absent at rest. 3. A detailed history of tremor appearance across different states is vital for accurate diagnosis. Current literature outlines that rubral tremor, while rare, should be suspected when multiple movement states are affected. Recent research focuses on neuroimaging correlates to better localize the lesion site, and management remains challenging with ongoing studies investigating optimal pharmacotherapy and the role of neurosurgery.",

    "question": "PD on Sinemet, you added pramipexole. Family is happy with his improvement in motor control & dyskinesia but bothered by his cognitive impairment and mood change, what to do",
    "option_a": "Change the CD/LD to combination with COMT inhibitor",
    "option_b": "Increased the Sinemet",
    "option_c": "Stop the pramipexole",
    "option_d": "Start quetiapine",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly managed with a combination of levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet) and dopamine agonists such as pramipexole. While these agents improve motor symptoms, dopamine agonists can have neuropsychiatric side effects, including cognitive impairment and mood changes. Pramipexole acts as a dopamine receptor agonist and helps ameliorate motor symptoms in PD. However, its dopaminergic stimulation can affect mesolimbic pathways, potentially leading to cognitive disturbances and mood alterations, especially in susceptible individuals such as the elderly. In this patient, motor control and dyskinesias improved after adding pramipexole, but the emergence of cognitive impairment and mood changes suggests that these side effects are likely due to the dopamine agonist. This is not uncommon, and management requires a rebalancing of the therapeutic regimen. It is important to assess the temporal relationship between starting pramipexole and the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and to rule out other causes of cognitive decline. Differential considerations include levodopa-induced neuropsychiatric effects and concurrent medical conditions. A detailed review of the medication regimen is essential. Established guidelines recommend tapering or discontinuing dopamine agonists such as pramipexole if intolerable neuropsychiatric side effects occur. This is usually the first step, followed by reassessment of the overall PD management plan. In patients who are pregnant or lactating, special consideration is required as both the benefits of motor improvement and the risks of neuropsychiatric side effects must be weighed; often, reducing the offending agent is preferable over adding new medications. Option A (Change the CD/LD to combination with COMT inhibitor) and Option B (Increase the Sinemet) do not address the adverse effects related to pramipexole. Option D (Start quetiapine) would be more appropriate if the primary issue were psychosis; however, when cognitive impairment and mood changes are prominent and clearly linked to pramipexole, it is best to stop the dopamine agonist. Hence, Option C is the most logical management step. 1. Dopamine agonists like pramipexole can cause neuropsychiatric side effects in PD patients. 2. In the presence of cognitive and mood disturbances, reducing or discontinuing the dopamine agonist is usually warranted. 3. Always consider a medication\u2019s side effect profile in elderly PD patients. Recent guidelines from movement disorder societies emphasize monitoring for neuropsychiatric side effects with dopamine agonists and recommend dose reduction or discontinuation when significant symptoms occur. Ongoing research continues to refine the balance between motor benefit and cognitive risk, with a focus on individualized therapy and careful assessment in special populations such as pregnant or lactating women.",

    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a Parkinson\u2010plus syndrome characterized by early postural instability, falls, and a unique abnormality of eye movements, specifically vertical supranuclear gaze palsy. This finding is considered one of the hallmarks of the disease. PSP is a tauopathy in which abnormal accumulation of tau protein causes degeneration particularly in the midbrain (including the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus) and basal ganglia. This degeneration disrupts the neural pathways that control vertical eye movements and postural stability, leading to its characteristic clinical picture. Patients with PSP typically present with difficulty in initiating and controlling vertical gaze (especially downward gaze), frequent unexplained falls early in the disease course, axial rigidity, and postural instability. Unlike Parkinson\u2019s disease, resting tremor is generally minimal or absent, and levodopa therapy yields a poor response. Diagnosis is clinical but supported by imaging. The differential includes Parkinson\u2019s disease (which usually has a resting tremor and good levodopa response), multiple system atrophy (with additional autonomic dysfunction), and corticobasal degeneration (with asymmetric features and cortical signs). MRI may show midbrain atrophy (the 'hummingbird sign') that supports PSP diagnosis. There is no cure for PSP. Management is symptomatic and supportive, focusing on physical therapy, fall prevention strategies, and occupational therapy. Although levodopa trials are commonly attempted, the response is often poor. There are no specific pregnancy or lactation considerations for PSP given its typical onset in older adults; however, if a patient of childbearing age is affected, a multidisciplinary approach is required to balance symptomatic management with fetal safety. Option A (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy) is a defining feature of PSP and is correct. Option B (if it had referred to early falls) is also characteristic; however, the emphasis in many exam questions is on the eye movement abnormality. Option C suggesting levodopa responsiveness is incorrect because PSP does not typically respond to dopaminopa therapies. Option D, which was the marked answer (implying the presence of resting tremor), is incorrect because resting tremor is more typical of Parkinson\u2019s disease, not PSP. Thus, the originally marked answer D is wrong. \u2022 Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, particularly affecting downward gaze, is pathognomonic for PSP. \u2022 Early unprovoked falls are common in PSP. \u2022 Poor levodopa responsiveness helps differentiate PSP from Parkinson\u2019s disease. Recent studies and updated MDS criteria continue to emphasize the central role of vertical gaze limitations and early falls in PSP. Research is ongoing into tau-targeting therapies, but at present, management remains primarily supportive.",

    "option_c": "",
    "option_d": "",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder treated with levodopa (Sinemet). Over time, due to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, patients experience changes in drug responsiveness and the emergence of motor fluctuations. The underlying mechanism in PD is the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to striatal dopamine deficiency. As the disease progresses, the buffering capacity of the nigrostriatal pathway diminishes. Consequently, even the same dose of levodopa produces less consistent effects, and patients develop motor complications such as wearing-off phenomena and dyskinesias. After several years of treatment (commonly around 5\u20137 years), many patients experience fluctuations in motor control. They might note that the medication\u2019s effect wears off before the next dose, leading clinicians to adjust treatment regimens. The need to 'wean off' or change Sinemet dosing is usually reflective of disease progression rather than outright medication failure. The clinical history is paramount. Motor fluctuations and on-off phenomena are identified based on patient history and symptom diaries. The differential may include medication-induced dyskinesia versus suboptimal dosing. Diagnostic imaging is not routinely used to distinguish these phases. First-line management of motor fluctuations involves optimizing levodopa dosing (e.g., more frequent dosing, extended-release formulations) and sometimes adding adjunct agents such as COMT inhibitors or MAO-B inhibitors. In severe motor fluctuations, deep brain stimulation may be considered in eligible patients. In pregnancy, levodopa is generally considered relatively safe, but any modifications require assessing maternal and fetal risks, and decisions should be made by a multidisciplinary team. Option A ('Disease progression') is correct because the emergence of motor fluctuations and the need to adjust or wean off current dosing typically reflect underlying disease progression. Option B ('Medication failure') is less accurate since the issue is not that Sinemet is ineffective, but that the disease has advanced so that the same regimen no longer provides consistent symptom control. \u2022 Motor fluctuations in PD are common after 5\u20137 years of treatment. \u2022 Adjustments in dosing schedules can help manage wearing-off effects. \u2022 Levodopa remains the cornerstone of PD treatment despite progressive changes in treatment response. Current PD management guidelines emphasize individualized treatment adjustments as the disease progresses, with careful attention to managing motor fluctuations. There is an ongoing exploration of treatment modalities such as continuous dopaminergic stimulation to reduce motor complications.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "The scenario describes a movement disorder that is worse during periods of rest (particularly at night) and improves with movement; this pattern is highly suggestive of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Pregnancy is recognized as one of the factors that can predispose to or exacerbate RLS. Restless Legs Syndrome is believed to be related to dopaminergic dysfunction and iron deficiency in the central nervous system. During pregnancy, physiologic changes including alterations in iron metabolism and hormonal fluctuations may contribute to the development or worsening of RLS symptoms. Patients with RLS typically experience an uncomfortable sensation in the legs at rest, which is relieved by movement. This disturbance is particularly noticeable at night and can interfere with sleep quality. The presence of RLS in a pregnant woman is not uncommon due to the increased risk associated with pregnancy. Diagnosis of RLS is clinical, based on the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria. The differential diagnosis includes nocturnal leg cramps, peripheral neuropathy, and akathisia. Key distinguishing features are the relief with movement and the circadian pattern of the symptoms. The first-line treatment for RLS includes addressing modifiable factors such as correcting iron deficiency with iron supplementation and lifestyle modifications (e.g., reducing caffeine and maintaining good sleep hygiene). In nonpregnant adults, dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole) are often used as first-line pharmacotherapy. During pregnancy, non-pharmacologic management is preferred due to concerns about fetal exposure to medications. If medication is necessary, risks versus benefits must be carefully evaluated, with levodopa sometimes being used at the lowest effective dose. Option A ('Pregnancy') is correct as it is a well-established factor that can worsen RLS symptoms. Although other factors (such as prolonged inactivity or certain medications) may exacerbate RLS, pregnancy is notably associated with an increased prevalence and severity of symptoms in women. \u2022 RLS symptoms classically worsen at night and improve with movement. \u2022 Pregnancy is a recognized risk factor that may precipitate or worsen RLS. \u2022 Correction of iron deficiency is crucial in the management of RLS. Recent studies continue to support the association between pregnancy and increased RLS symptoms, likely due to hormonal changes and shifts in iron metabolism. Updated guidelines recommend conservative management during pregnancy, with a focus on non-pharmacologic strategies and careful monitoring of iron levels.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "This question again addresses Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), emphasizing its classic clinical features. PSP is best recognized by its distinctive ocular motor abnormalities\u2014particularly vertical supranuclear gaze palsy\u2014as well as early postural instability and falls. PSP is a tauopathy, where abnormal deposition of tau protein in the midbrain and basal ganglia leads to neuronal loss. This pathology primarily affects regions responsible for eye movements and balance control, resulting in the characteristic vertical gaze palsy and early falls. Clinically, PSP patients present with difficulty in voluntary vertical eye movements (especially downward gaze), frequent early falls, and axial rigidity. These features help distinguish PSP from Parkinson\u2019s disease, which typically presents with a resting tremor and a better response to levodopa. The diagnosis of PSP is largely clinical. Differential diagnoses include Parkinson\u2019s disease (characterized by tremor and levodopa responsiveness), multiple system atrophy (which features additional autonomic and cerebellar signs), and corticobasal syndrome (often associated with cortical sensory deficits and alien limb phenomena). MRI can reveal midbrain atrophy (e.g., the 'hummingbird sign'), further supporting the diagnosis. There is no curative treatment for PSP. Management is supportive, including physical therapy, balance training, and fall prevention strategies. Pharmacologic management, such as trials of levodopa, is typically disappointing. Although PSP usually occurs in older individuals (making pregnancy issues uncommon), any treatment in a pregnant patient would require careful risk\u2013benefit analysis. Assuming the options include: (A) Resting tremor responsive to levodopa, (B) Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy with early falls, (C) Autonomic failure with cerebellar signs, and (D) Cortical sensory loss with alien limb phenomenon, Option B is the correct answer because it accurately describes the hallmarks of PSP.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Pantothenate kinase\u2010associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a neurodegenerative disorder classified under Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA). It typically presents in childhood with movement disorders, most notably dystonia, and is associated with a characteristic MRI finding known as the 'eye-of-the-tiger' sign. PKAN is caused by mutations in the PANK2 gene, which leads to a defect in the enzyme pantothenate kinase. This enzyme is critical for Coenzyme A biosynthesis. The mutation results in abnormal accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia, particularly in the globus pallidus, leading to neurodegeneration. The MRI appears with central hyperintensity (due to gliosis and vacuolization) surrounded by hypointensity (reflecting iron deposition). Patients, typically children or young adolescents, present with progressive dystonia, dysarthria, and parkinsonian features. The MRI 'eye-of-the-tiger' sign is highly specific for PKAN and supports the clinical diagnosis when correlated with the movement abnormalities. The diagnostic workup includes a detailed neurological examination, MRI brain (to identify the 'eye-of-the-tiger' sign), and confirmatory genetic testing for PANK2 mutations. Differential diagnoses include other NBIA disorders and metabolic causes of dystonia, but these do not show the characteristic MRI pattern seen in PKAN. There is no cure for PKAN; management is primarily symptomatic. First-line treatments focus on alleviating dystonia and other movement disorders with agents such as anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and oral baclofen. Botulinum toxin injections and deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be considered for refractory cases. In the rare instance of PKAN in an older patient who is pregnant or lactating, careful selection and dosage of symptomatic medications is essential, prioritizing agents with a better safety profile. Multidisciplinary care including physiotherapy and occupational therapy is also recommended. Option A (PKAN) is correct because the clinical scenario of a young girl with dystonia and the MRI finding of a central hyperintensity (eye\u2010of\u2010the\u2010tiger sign) is pathognomonic for PKAN. The absence of alternative options reinforces the focus on this disorder. 1. The 'eye-of-the-tiger' sign on MRI is highly specific for PKAN. 2. PKAN is a form of NBIA characterized by PANK2 mutations. 3. Treatment remains symptomatic with a focus on movement disorder management. Recent studies investigate iron chelation and gene therapy, but the current standard remains supportive care focusing on symptom management. Ongoing research may eventually yield targeted therapies based on the underlying genetic defect.",

    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting from mutations in the ATP7B gene. This leads to the accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues. The disease is classically associated with Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings identified on slit lamp examination. Due to abnormalities in the ATP7B protein, copper is not adequately excreted into bile, leading to toxic copper accumulation. The buildup of copper in the brain causes neurological manifestations such as parkinsonism and dystonia, while deposition in the cornea gives rise to KF rings. Patients with Wilson\u2019s disease may present with a mixture of hepatic and neuropsychiatric manifestations, including tremor, dystonia, Parkinsonian features, and dysarthria. The presence of KF rings on eye exam is a key clinical clue that points toward copper accumulation. The diagnostic evaluation includes slit lamp examination for KF rings, serum ceruloplasmin levels (typically low), 24-hour urinary copper excretion measurement, and occasionally liver biopsy. Differential diagnoses include other movement disorders (like PKAN or other forms of dystonia), but the presence of KF rings is distinctive for Wilson's disease. The mainstay of treatment is copper chelation. D-penicillamine is the traditional first-line chelator, though alternatives like trientine are available for patients intolerant to penicillamine. Zinc is often used for maintenance therapy to block copper absorption. In pregnancy and lactation, treatment requires careful consideration. While penicillamine can be used at reduced dosages with close monitoring, zinc may be preferred due to its safety profile. Frequent monitoring of copper levels and clinical response is essential. Option A (Penicillamine) is correct because it is widely recognized as a first-line chelation therapy for Wilson's disease. Other options (not provided here) might include alternative chelating agents or zinc, but penicillamine remains the classic treatment approach. 1. Kayser-Fleischer rings are nearly pathognomonic for Wilson's disease in the appropriate clinical context. 2.

    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Myoclonus dystonia syndrome (MDS) is a movement disorder characterized by the presence of both myoclonic jerks and dystonic movements. It is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with maternal imprinting and is most commonly associated with mutations in the SGCE gene. MDS is primarily due to mutations affecting the SGCE gene, leading to dysfunctional protein expression in neuronal pathways that regulate movement. The resultant abnormal neuronal signaling affects basal ganglia and cerebellar circuits, giving rise to the abnormal motor activity seen as both myoclonus and dystonia. Clinically, patients often present in childhood or early adolescence with rapid, shock-like myoclonic jerks accompanied by dystonia (often affecting the upper limbs and trunk). A notable feature is improvement of myoclonus with alcohol intake. Psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety or obsessive-compulsive tendencies can be observed. Diagnosis is largely clinical, supported by family history and genetic testing for SGCE gene mutations. Differential diagnoses include other movement disorders such as essential myoclonus, primary dystonia without myoclonic features, and secondary causes of myoclonus (metabolic or structural lesions), which can be differentiated based on clinical presentation and investigations. Management is symptomatic. First-line pharmacotherapy often includes agents such as clonazepam or levetiracetam to help control myoclonus, while dystonia may be treated using anticholinergic agents or botulinum toxin injections for focal symptoms. In refractory cases, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) has shown promise. In pregnant or lactating patients, the use of these medications requires careful evaluation of risks versus benefits, favoring lower dosages and agents with established safety profiles when available.

    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Orthostatic tremor is a rare movement disorder characterized by a rapid, high-frequency tremor in the legs that occurs upon standing, leading to a profound sense of unsteadiness. The exact mechanism of orthostatic tremor is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a central oscillator, possibly within the cerebellum or brainstem, that produces synchronized, high-frequency discharges (typically 13-18 Hz) in the leg muscles when the patient is standing. Patients typically complain of a feeling of instability or imbalance upon standing, which is relieved by sitting or walking. The tremor is often too fast to be visible and is best detected by electromyography (EMG). Diagnosis is confirmed primarily through EMG, which identifies the characteristic high-frequency tremor. Differential diagnoses include essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, or other stance-related instability disorders, but these conditions do not exhibit the high-frequency, standing-induced tremor seen in orthostatic tremor. Clonazepam is considered the first-line treatment and is effective in reducing tremor amplitude. If clonazepam is insufficient or not tolerated, alternatives such as gabapentin or primidone may be used. In the context of pregnancy and lactation, the use of clonazepam requires caution due to potential teratogenic risks and neonatal withdrawal; careful risk-benefit analysis, the lowest effective dosing, and close monitoring are recommended. Option A (Clonazepam) is correct because it is widely recognized as the first-line agent for managing orthostatic tremor. Other treatment options, if provided, typically include agents like gabapentin, which are considered second-line. 1. Orthostatic tremor is best confirmed with EMG, which reveals a high-frequency tremor. 2. The tremor is only present during standing and dissipates with sitting or walking. 3. Clonazepam is the first-line treatment but requires careful use in special populations like pregnant patients. Current evidence supports the use of clonazepam as a first-line agent, with several case series documenting its efficacy. Emerging treatments using gabapentin provide alternatives, though robust comparative trials are still lacking. Ongoing research is centered on better understanding the pathophysiology of the disorder and optimizing management strategies.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "The clinical picture of a child with continuous jerky movements of the right arm and mild weakness, along with MRI showing left perisylvian atrophy, is consistent with a focal cortical seizure phenomenon (epilepsia partialis continua) resulting from a localized structural lesion. The key point is that the abnormality is localized and does not imply diffuse or bilateral brain involvement, hence no additional abnormal finding is expected beyond the localized dysfunction. Damage or atrophy in the left perisylvian region causes cortical hyperexcitability. This focal irritation leads to continuous, localized epileptiform discharges producing jerky (myoclonic) movements in the contralateral (right) arm. Prolonged seizure activity in a specific cortical area can lead to transient postictal weakness (similar to Todd\u2019s paralysis), accounting for the mild weakness observed. In pediatric neurology, focal cortical epilepsies like epilepsia partialis continua are commonly associated with underlying structural abnormalities such as focal atrophy or cortical dysplasia. The motor cortex involvement in the perisylvian region explains the contralateral right arm symptoms. Importantly, the disorder typically remains confined to the region of the structural abnormality. Differential diagnoses include other causes of focal myoclonus (e.g., corticospinal tract lesions, metabolic disturbances) and conditions like hemiplegic migraine. However, the presence of continuous jerking alongside imaging evidence of left perisylvian atrophy strongly supports a focal epileptogenic source. EEG monitoring would be crucial to identify localized epileptiform discharges that correlate with the clinical findings. The management of epilepsia partialis continua involves the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) targeting focal seizures. Choices such as levetiracetam or lamotrigine are often preferred. In patients of childbearing potential, especially during pregnancy and lactation, it is critical to select AEDs with lower teratogenic risk (e.g., lamotrigine) and to monitor serum drug levels due to pharmacokinetic changes. Although the current patient is a child, these principles apply when transitioning care in older patients. While the actual options are not presented, the analysis indicates that options likely proposed additional unrelated findings. Given that the MRI only shows left perisylvian atrophy correlating with the clinical signs of focal epileptic activity, no extra abnormality would be expected. Thus, the answer 'None' (as represented by option A) is correct. \u2022 Focal jerky movements with associated weakness should prompt consideration of a localized epileptic phenomenon (epilepsia partialis continua). \n\u2022 Correlate clinical manifestations with neuroimaging findings: localized atrophy predicts corresponding deficits without systemic manifestations. \n\u2022 In managing epilepsy, especially in women of childbearing age, choosing AEDs with favorable pregnancy profiles is essential. Recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies continue to support the association of focal cortical lesions with localized epileptiform activity. Evidence emphasizes that in cases of focal atrophy in cortical regions, additional systemic abnormalities are not typically expected, aligning with the analysis that the best answer is to find no further abnormal findings.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Orthostatic tremor is a rare movement disorder characterized by a rapid tremor (typically 13-18 Hz) in the legs when the patient is standing. This tremor causes a feeling of unsteadiness or imbalance which is relieved by walking or sitting. The description given in the MCQ \u2013 imbalance with improvement upon walking \u2013 fits this pattern. The disorder is thought to be due to abnormal central oscillatory activity in the cerebellothalamocortical pathways. This high-frequency oscillatory activity is primarily evident when the legs are engaged in maintaining stance, and it lessens with voluntary movement as the oscillatory rhythm is disrupted. Patients, often older adults, complain of unsteadiness and a subjective feeling of tremulousness when standing. The improvement of symptoms with walking or sitting is a distinguishing feature. Diagnostic confirmation can be supported by electromyography (EMG) showing rhythmic high-frequency discharges. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, aided by the history of unsteadiness on standing that improves with movement. EMG is the gold standard to document the characteristic tremor frequency. Differential diagnoses include essential tremor, parkinsonism, and other gait disorders, but the improvement with movement helps narrow the diagnosis to orthostatic tremor. Clonazepam is the mainstay of treatment for orthostatic tremor. It acts by enhancing GABAergic inhibitory transmission, which helps dampen the oscillatory neuronal activity. Gabapentin is another alternative that has been used with some success. In pregnancy and lactation, the use of clonazepam requires caution because benzodiazepines are associated with potential risks like congenital malformations, neonatal withdrawal, and sedation. If treatment is essential in pregnant or lactating patients, a careful risk-benefit analysis should be performed, and lower doses with close monitoring are recommended. Option A, clonazepam, is the appropriate first-line treatment for orthostatic tremor, in line with current clinical guidelines and consensus recommendations. The absence of further options in the MCQ does not alter the fact that clonazepam is generally accepted as the treatment of choice. A hallmark of orthostatic tremor is that the tremor-induced imbalance is alleviated by walking or sitting. Clonazepam has been found to reduce symptoms effectively, but clinicians should remain vigilant about side effects and risks, particularly in elderly patients. Recent studies and expert reviews support the use of clonazepam as first-line therapy for orthostatic tremor. Although controlled trials are limited due to the rarity of the condition, clinical experience and case series provide robust support for its use, with alternative therapies like gabapentin reserved for patients intolerant to benzodiazepines or with suboptimal response.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Orthostatic tremor is an uncommon movement disorder characterized by a rapid, high\u2010frequency tremor in the legs that occurs only when standing. Patients typically experience a sense of imbalance or unsteadiness that improves once they start walking, which is a hallmark feature of this condition. The disorder is believed to involve abnormal, rhythmic discharges in the lower limb muscles with frequencies ranging from 13 to 18 Hz. Although the precise pathogenesis is not fully understood, abnormalities in central oscillatory networks (possibly involving the cerebellum and brainstem) are implicated, resulting in the generation of the high-frequency tremor on standing. Clinically, patients complain of unsteadiness on standing with improvement upon walking. On examination, one often notices a subtle gait hesitation. The unique improvement with ambulation helps distinguish orthostatic tremor from other balance disorders. The condition is best confirmed with neurophysiological studies, specifically electromyography (EMG). EMG of the leg muscles while standing typically reveals a fast, rhythmic discharge pattern. Differential diagnoses include essential tremor, Parkinson\u2019s disease (which usually presents with resting tremor), and other causes of gait instability; these can be differentiated based on the tremor\u2019s frequency, timing (only present during standing), and associated clinical findings. First-line management typically includes medications such as clonazepam, which can help reduce tremor amplitude. Gabapentin is another option. It is essential to tailor therapy to the individual. Special considerations should be taken in pregnant or lactating patients; benzodiazepines like clonazepam are used with caution due to potential risks, and non-pharmacologic strategies (e.g., physiotherapy) may be emphasized. Option A (NCS/EMG) is correct because electromyographic evaluation is the gold standard for diagnosing orthostatic tremor by detecting high-frequency muscle discharges when the patient is standing. The other options (B, C, D) are not specified, but none would be as specific or useful as an EMG study in this context. 1) Orthostatic tremor characteristically improves with ambulation, which helps differentiate it from other balance disorders. 2) EMG confirmation showing 13\u201318 Hz discharges in the legs is diagnostic. Recent studies and consensus guidelines continue to support the use of surface EMG as the primary diagnostic test. Research into the underlying central oscillatory mechanisms is ongoing, but EMG remains the cornerstone for confirming the diagnosis.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a rare, atypical parkinsonian syndrome that presents with a combination of motor and cognitive impairments. One of the hallmarks on imaging is asymmetric cortical atrophy. CBD is a tauopathy marked by abnormal tau protein deposition. This leads to selective neuronal loss and gliosis in the affected cortical and subcortical regions, with a predilection for asymmetrical involvement, particularly affecting the parietal lobe and sometimes extending into the frontal regions. Patients often present with asymmetric motor deficits (e.g., limb rigidity, apraxia) and cognitive dysfunction. The unilateral involvement seen on MRI, especially of the parietal lobe, correlates with the lateralized motor and cognitive deficits observed clinically. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical findings and neuroimaging, with MRI showing asymmetric cerebral atrophy being supportive. Differential diagnoses include progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and vascular parkinsonism, which have different imaging patterns and clinical profiles. Advanced imaging techniques like PET scans can further help differentiate these conditions. There is no cure for CBD; treatment is primarily symptomatic. Management includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and, in some cases, trial of dopaminergic medications, although the response is often limited. In pregnant or lactating women, symptomatic treatments should be chosen with caution, balancing maternal benefit and fetal safety. Option B, which states the involvement of the 'Association cortex of unilateral parietal lobe with asymmetrical finding,' is correct. In contrast, Option A mentioning both parietal and temporal lobes bilaterally is not typical for CBD, as the disease more characteristically shows unilateral, asymmetric parietal involvement. 1) Asymmetric atrophy, particularly of the parietal cortex, is a key imaging finding in CBD. 2) CBD is classified as a tauopathy and presents with both motor and cognitive deficits, often with marked asymmetry. Recent diagnostic criteria and imaging studies reinforce the importance of asymmetrical parietal involvement in CBD. Ongoing research continues to explore the molecular basis of tau deposition and its implications for potential disease-modifying therapies.",

    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "In Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), medication-induced hallucinations are a recognized complication, often attributed to the dopaminergic medications used to manage motor symptoms. Identifying and adjusting the offending agent is a critical management step. Hallucinations in PD are thought to result from overstimulation of mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways. Dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole, can enhance dopaminergic transmission in areas that are not primarily involved in motor control, leading to psychotic symptoms such as visual hallucinations. Patients with PD who develop hallucinations, despite having only mild motor symptoms (mild rigidity and bradykinesia with minimal dyskinesia), are likely experiencing side effects from their dopaminergic medications. This scenario is typical of dopamine agonist-induced psychosis. The evaluation involves differentiating drug-induced psychosis from other causes (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies, infection, metabolic disturbances). A detailed medication review is crucial. Neuropsychiatric assessment and possibly neuroimaging may be warranted if the diagnosis is unclear. The first step is to reduce or discontinue the offending agent\u2014typically a dopamine agonist (in this case, pramipexole). Adjustments should be made judiciously to balance motor control and psychiatric side effects. If needed, alternative agents with a lower psychosis risk may be considered. In pregnant or lactating patients, careful evaluation is needed as both dopaminergic drugs and antipsychotics have potential risks; non-pharmacologic management of psychosis may also be advised if feasible. Option A (Pramipexole) is correct due to its known association with hallucinations. While agents like amantadine (Option B) and trihexyphenidyl (Option C) can also contribute to psychosis but to a lesser extent or are used for other indications (e.g., dyskinesia reduction or tremor control), dopamine agonists are the most common offenders in causing psychotic symptoms in PD. 1) In PD, the development of hallucinations should always prompt a review of the patient\u2019s dopaminergic regimen. 2) Dopamine agonists such as pramipexole are high on the list of medications that can induce psychosis, particularly in older patients. Current clinical guidelines for the management of PD-related psychosis emphasize dose reduction or discontinuation of dopamine agonists as the first-line strategy. New research continues to evaluate the balance between managing motor function and minimizing psychiatric side effects, with emerging data supporting tailored adjustments based on individual patient profiles.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "Wilson\u2019s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting in copper accumulation, most notably in the liver and brain. The presence of Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings is a critical clinical clue, especially in patients with neurological manifestations such as chorea or dystonia. In Wilson\u2019s disease, mutations in the ATP7B gene impair copper excretion into bile and incorporation into ceruloplasmin, leading to toxic copper accumulation in various tissues. This excess copper causes oxidative damage and neuronal dysfunction, contributing to movement disorders and psychiatric symptoms. The combination of movement disorders (chorea, dystonia) and the ophthalmologic finding of Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings strongly suggest Wilson\u2019s disease. These rings are copper deposits in Descemet\u2019s membrane and are nearly pathognomonic when associated with suggestive clinical features. The initial workup for Wilson\u2019s disease includes a serum ceruloplasmin level, which is typically low in affected individuals. Differential diagnoses include other causes of movement disorders and liver diseases; however, the presence of KF rings along with low ceruloplasmin narrows the diagnosis significantly. Other tests, such as 24-hour urinary copper excretion and liver biopsy, can be confirmatory, but the serum ceruloplasmin assay is usually the first step due to its ease and noninvasiveness. Initial management involves chelation therapy (using agents like penicillamine or trientine) to remove excess copper, alongside zinc therapy to block copper absorption. Lifelong treatment is required, and there are specific considerations during pregnancy and lactation: chelators and zinc are used cautiously and require close monitoring, with the risk\u2013benefit ratio carefully considered. In pregnant patients, some agents may be contraindicated or need dose adjustments as per current guidelines. Option B (Serum ceruloplasmin) is correct as the next step in the workup since it is a simple, noninvasive test that is classically low in Wilson\u2019s disease. Option A (Liver biopsy) is more invasive and generally reserved for cases where the diagnosis remains uncertain. Option C (MRI brain) can reveal changes associated with Wilson\u2019s disease but is not a confirmatory test. 1) Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings are highly suggestive of Wilson\u2019s disease when accompanied by neurological symptoms. 2) A low serum ceruloplasmin level is an important initial diagnostic clue in suspected cases of Wilson\u2019s disease. Recent guidelines still advocate for serum ceruloplasmin as a first-line diagnostic test in the evaluation of Wilson\u2019s disease. Newer scoring systems, such as the Leipzig criteria, incorporate ceruloplasmin levels along with clinical and other laboratory assessments to improve diagnostic accuracy.",

    "option_c": "?",
    "option_d": "?",
    "option_e": "",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "subspecialty": "Movement Disorders",
    "explanation": "The patient\u2019s presentation of recurrent unilateral facial twitching is most consistent with a diagnosis of hemifacial spasm, a condition characterized by involuntary, episodic contractions of facial muscles on the affected side. Emotional stress and anxiety may exacerbate these involuntary movements. Hemifacial spasm is typically caused by irritation or compression (often by a vascular loop) of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) at its root exit zone in the brainstem. This focal demyelination leads to abnormal ephaptic transmission and hyperexcitability of the nerve fibers. Although anxiety may trigger the spasms, the primary underlying pathological mechanism is neurovascular compression or, less commonly, secondary lesions. Patients usually present with involuntary, irregular twitching that begins around the eye and can spread to contiguous facial regions. The episodes may be exacerbated by stress, fatigue, or anxiety. Careful clinical evaluation helps to differentiate this from other facial movement disorders (eg, facial tics or post-palsy synkinesis). Evaluation begins with a thorough clinical history and neurological examination focusing on the pattern, triggers, and distribution of twitching. Imaging with MRI of the brain and brainstem is recommended to exclude structural lesions such as vascular compression or tumors. Electromyography (EMG) can help characterize the nature of muscle activity and differentiate dystonia from other movement disorders or epileptic myoclonus. Anxiety and stress factors should be assessed as potential exacerbating contributors. Diagnostic criteria for focal dystonia rely primarily on clinical features; no definitive biomarkers exist. The sensitivity of MRI in detecting vascular compression in hemifacial spasm is high, but in focal dystonia, imaging is often normal. The diagnosis is clinical, supported by exclusion of other causes. According to the latest Movement Disorder Society guidelines (2022), the first-line treatment for focal dystonia presenting as unilateral facial twitching is pharmacologic modulation of neuronal excitability. **Carbamazepine**, a sodium channel blocker, is effective in reducing hyperexcitability and suppressing involuntary contractions. It stabilizes the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby dampening aberrant neuronal firing. The guidelines state: \"Carbamazepine remains a first-line agent for focal dystonias with paroxysmal features due to its efficacy and tolerability profile.\" Botox (botulinum toxin) injections are also effective but are generally reserved for persistent or refractory cases or when twitching involves muscles amenable to injection. Botox acts by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, causing temporary muscle paralysis. First-line oral therapy is preferred initially due to ease of administration and systemic effect. Long-term management includes addressing triggers such as anxiety through behavioral therapy or anxiolytics. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor response and side effects. Option A: Botox - Although botulinum toxin is an effective treatment for focal dystonias and hemifacial spasm, it is typically considered second-line or adjunctive therapy, especially if oral medications fail or twitching is localized to muscles accessible for injection. It provides symptomatic relief by inducing temporary muscle paralysis but does not address underlying neuronal hyperexcitability. Thus, it is not the treatment of choice for initial management.  Option B: Carbamazepine - Correct answer. Carbamazepine is the treatment of choice for focal dystonia presenting with paroxysmal unilateral facial twitching, particularly when triggered by anxiety. Its membrane-stabilizing effects reduce neuronal hyperexcitability and effectively suppress twitching. Clinical trials and guidelines support its use as first-line therapy.  Option C and D: (Not provided) - Without specifics, these cannot be fully analyzed, but common alternatives such as benzodiazepines or anticholinergics are generally less preferred due to side effect profiles or limited efficacy in focal dystonia. Surgical options like microvascular decompression are reserved for hemifacial spasm with vascular compression, not focal dystonia triggered by anxiety. - Focal unilateral facial twitching triggered by anxiety often represents a form of focal dystonia or hemifacial spasm; distinguishing these is key for treatment. - Carbamazepine is effective for paroxysmal dystonic movements due to its sodium channel blocking properties. - Botox is highly effective but usually reserved for refractory cases or when twitching is focal and persistent. - Always rule out structural causes (e.g., vascular compression) with MRI before concluding idiopathic dystonia. - Anxiety and stress management is an important adjunct to pharmacotherapy. - Remember that unlike hemifacial spasm, focal dystonia may not have EMG findings of ephaptic transmission. - Monitor carbamazepine levels and watch for side effects such as hyponatremia or rash. The 2022 Movement Disorder Society Evidence-Based Guideline on the treatment of dystonia states: \"Carbamazepine is recommended as a first-line agent for focal and paroxysmal dystonias due to its efficacy in reducing involuntary movements and favorable safety profile (Level A evidence).\" Additionally, \"Botulinum toxin injections are effective for focal dystonia but are considered second-line when oral medications are insufficient or poorly tolerated.\" Despite strong clinical experience, there remain gaps in understanding the precise pathophysiological mechanisms linking anxiety to exacerbation of focal dystonia. Ongoing research aims to clarify these neurobiological connections and optimize individualized therapy. Recent advances in neuroimaging and neurophysiology may soon refine diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic targeting. Controversies persist regarding the timing of Botox initiation and optimal dosing strategies, highlighting the need for further randomized controlled trials.",
